Acquired means that you can get infected and Immune Deficiency being the bodies' weakness to fight such diseases, with Syndrome meaning health problems that contribute to making the disease. AIDS is caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). It is when a person's immune system is too weak to fight off many infections, and develops when the HIV infection is very advanced. This is the last stage of the HIV infection where the body can no longer defend itself and may develop various diseases, infections and if left untreated, can result in death. Source and description AIDS is the stage of infection that occurs when the bodies' immune system is badly damaged and you become vulnerable to infections. When the number of your CD4 cells fall below 200 cells per cubic millimetre of blood, or specific occurrence of disease associated with the HIV infection, then you are considered to have progressed to AIDS. The most common initial conditions alerting to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia (caused by yeast like fungus), Cachexia (wasting syndrome), Oesophageal Candidiasis (infection of the oesophagus) and respiratory tract infections. Opportunistic infections can be caused by bacterial, viral, fungi and parasites that are normally controlled by the immune system, and take advantage of a weakened immune system. Infections that occur will depend on the organisms that are common in the person's environment, and can affect nearly every organ system. Without treatment people who are diagnosed with AIDS will survive about three years. Once a person has a dangerous illness their life expectancy without treatment falls to around one year. People living with AIDS have an increased risk to developing various viral induced cancers. In addition they can also have systemic symptoms such as prolonged fevers, sweats, swollen lymph nodes, chills, weakness, weight loss and diarrhoea. They can also be affected by psychiatric and neurological symptoms. History In 1981 AIDS was first clinically observed in the United States, with the first initial cases of injecting drug users and homosexual men that had no known cause of impaired immunity but showed symptoms of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, which was a rare opportunistic infection known to occur in people with compromised immune systems. They found that a number of homosexual men had developed skin cancer with many more cases emerging the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were informed to monitor this outbreak. During the early days CDC did not hold an official name for the disease, they would often refer to it by the way of the diseases associated with it such as lymphadenopathy, which the discoverers of HIV had originally named the virus. In 1982 the term AIDS was introduced and CDC started to refer to the disease as AIDS. Two research groups led by Robert Gallo and Luc Montagnier declared that a retrovirus may have been infecting people with AIDS, publishing the findings in the journal of science. Galo said that a virus which his research group had found, isolated from a person with aids was similar in shape to other human T-lymph tropic viruses. While Montagniers group isolated a virus from a person presenting with swelling of their lymph nodes of the neck and had physical weaknesses, that were classified as two characteristics of AIDS. Montagnier named their virus lymphadenopathy associated virus. It turns out that these to viruses were the same and in 1986 they were renamed HIV. HIV is believed to originate from non-human primates in West Central Africa and was transferred to humans in the 20th century. HIV-1 is seen to originate from Southern Cameroon and the evolution of the simian immunodeficiency virus that affects wild chimpanzee's. Monkey's today are resistant to the HIV-1 infection because of a genomic fusion of two viral resistance genes. It is thought that HIV-1 had jumped the species barrier on three separate occasions giving rise to three groups of virus M, N, O. There is evidence that humans have commonly acquired SIV from participating in bush meat activates. Although SIV is a weak virus it is typically supressed by the human immune system within weeks, however if there have been several transmissions of the virus from individual to individual in quick succession, allowing it enough time to mutate into HIV. Due to relatively low person-to-person transmission rate SIV can only spread in population in the presence of one or more high risk transmission channels, which are thought to have been absent in Africa in the 20thcentury. High-risk transmission channels, allows the virus to adapt to humans and spread through society, depending on proposed timing of animal to human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of HIV-1 m dates back to circa 1910. The link of the HIV epidemic with the growth of colonialism in African cities, with social changes, including sexual promiscuity and the spread of prostitution. Another view was the unsafe medical practices in Africa after the Second World War. From the reuse of unsterile single use syringes during mass vaccinations, antibiotic and anti -malaria treatment campaigns were the initial vector that allowed the virus to adapt and spread to humans. The earliest and documented case of HIV in humans was in 1959 in Congo. The virus may have been present in the United States in 1966; the vast majority of infections occurring outside of Africa is traced back to one individual who was infected with HIV in Hatli, who then brought the infections to the United States in 1969. The epidemic then rapidly spread among high-risk groups. The treatment suffers receive can be a highly active anti-retroviral therapy known as HAART is allows for the stabilization of symptoms and can partially recover the CD4 T cell levels , in addition to also reducing the level of virus in the blood to low or undetectable levels. With disease specific drugs being able to alleviate the symptoms of AIDS. This medical treatment can help reduce the infection of HIV in many cases but by no means can constitute a cure. One myth in Africa is that sex with an uninfected virgin can cure AIDS, this is however not the case it does not cure AIDS but such contact does exposes the uninfected individual to HIV infection. Culture AIDS is predominately a highly debated topic that unfortunately carries a stigma in society around the world. Many people infected with HIV have been discriminated against, rejected from social situations, shunned and avoided. There has been substantial violence towards those infected or perceived to be infected. This stigma presents people from seeking HIV testing, returning for their results, or securing any kind of treatment. In religion the topic of AIDS has become controversial due to some religious authorities opposing the use of condoms. The religious approach to preventing the spread of aids. According to a report by American health 'The Catholic Church and Global AIDS crisis' states that cultural changes are needed to re-emphasis on fidelity within marriage and sexual abstinence outside of it. Where some religious organisations have claimed that prayer can cure HIV/AIDS. The nosode prepared from the blood of a man diagnosed as having Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome who subsequently died of Syndrome related diseases. In Memoriam The publication of this proving is dedicated to the memory of Mariette Honig who died in August 1999. This proving was just one of many projects into which Marriette put so much effort. It was her application and intellect that brought this proving, and so many other recent innovations in homoeopathy, to the attention of our community. She will be missed. Acknowledgments Thanks and acknowledgments go to: All the provers who participated willingly and accidentally. The many co-workers, collators, extractors and researchers, notably: Jo Overton, Dee MacLachlan, Mariette and Peter Fraser. Helios Pharmacy and Friends of Homoeopathy for financial aid. Introduction When news of AIDS sprang upon the world most were deeply shocked; fear of death and moral indignation combined to create a horror suitable for a gloomy and apocalyptic prognosis of the future. It seemed as if a new plague was about to be loosed upon the world. Since then our view has become increasingly sober, yet our initial collective response is held as a memory within the 'genius' of the nosode. It is with this presupposition in mind (that sociological, mythical as well as classically proven aspects are woven into the 'plot') that I shall be making some general observations about the remedy. Writing poetry is both a hobby and a personal diary. At the time of the group proving of the AIDS nosode I wrote this poem: I dreamed of the eclipse of light I dreamed of the eclipse of light, myself in deathward flight. There was no one to hear my stricken yell. Into deepest pit I plummeted, dismembering myself as I fell. The horror was in the severing. Now awakened and spinning like an eccentric merry-go-round, I consider the nature of suffering. It seems that I have lifetimes within which to cut off my attachments. Yet will I become light enough to reach the ground without fatal fracturing? Holding to past's images are sources of the future, without this history all necessity falls away. Parent's conditional love and societies expectations are things which kill invention and dim the laughter of the free one who dwells within. And the nightmare, that dark horse upon which we ride through landscapes half familiar and therefore half terrifying, is a therapeutic stage; a laboratory of remembering and dismembering parts within which our images are as actors who jibe and rage, until we are made lighter than a dusty sack of ancient bones By Misha Norland The proving The proving was undertaken initially in 1988 using single doses in either the 30 or 200 centesimal potencies of blood of a man who subsequently died of AIDS related diseases. The identity of this man and his case history is not known. It was shrouded to 'protect' his family. Likewise the homoeopathic pharmacy who ran up the potencies wishes to remain anonymous. Hiding, concealing, even lying because of self loathing and mistrust have shown themselves to be characteristics of the genius of this remedy, as also is the opposite trait: of openness and candour. (The remedy may be obtained from the Helios Homoeopathic Pharmacy.) Results, of the initial provings, though portraying some symptom pattern, did not convey the 'shape' of the remedy. Therefore, I sent some pillules to Mariette Honig in Holland who carried out a similarly exhaustive, yet, ultimately unilluminating, proving. The verified symptoms of these provings have been included in the extraction presented. However, the picture of the nosode emerged with flying colours when in 1994 we carried out two group provings amongst students at The School of Homoeopathy. One group received 30c and the other the 200th. At the School we have carried out all our provings with unit doses. This stimulus, perhaps because it is amplified by the many coexperiencers, and is 'reawakened' at monthly gatherings when experiences are recounted, is sufficient to produce long range effects. We followed Jeremy Sherr's general proving methodology in this proving, however, individuals, timings and codes are not given. Additionally we recorded our experiences some minutes after beginning the proving. This is given at the beginning of the proving report. We got images (such as billowing clouds, popping seed pods, orange flowers, and responses to these images such as associated feelings, sensations or thoughts); feelings (such as joy, sadness, and their responses such as smiling or closing off); sensations (such as floating, burning, itching, and their responses such as restlessness or scratching); thoughts and concepts which in turn may evoke images, feelings and sensations. This then is our primary data. It would be in accordance with tradition to say that proving responses are headed up by an image at the top of a natural hierarchy which proceeds down the levels, through thoughts to feelings to sensations. But some provers vary here, for instance, by having a preponderance of sensation experiences, or feeling responses. This depends upon their innate personality structure, as would be described elementally as preponderances of Fire, Air, Water, Earth. During the course of the School weekend (Friday through to Sunday) we took stock of thoughts, dreams, sensations, feelings and outer world happenings, using transcripts of tape recordings to insure accuracy, while supervisors and daily proving diaries filled in details from month to month. Audio recording spanned a period of three months, while some reports of cured symptoms continued to come in for the next two years. Also included in this document are two cured cases, one resulting from Mariette Honig's Holland provings, one from our proving at the School. (Other cases are being added in a separate section). These, perhaps more than the proving itself, helped us get to grips with key causations and expressions of the remedy and qualified some of its therapeutic range. Therefore these cases and responses to remedies including the AIDS nosode are given in some detail. Some of you will remember Prover A coming forward to join me upon the occasion of the ECCH & ICCH Case Conference in Holland in May 1995 and again in UK at the Society of Homoeopaths Conference later that year. Her story was and is deeply shocking and provoked strong responses amongst participants many of whom were critical of what had occurred when she laid her soul bare. This response is typical of the feeling tone associated with AIDS: shock and condemnation - anything not to be contaminated by association! She had requested that her identity be revealed in association with this proving thus providing a gift for the homoeopathic community as well as transforming her suffering into a personal as well as public understanding of the remedy. This act strikes me as being typical of the dynamic which the disease and the remedy set up. On the one hand there are dirty secrets, the Syphilitic aspects of the nosode, while on the other, there is the desire for openness, candour and above all for intimate contact and a flow from within to without, without to within. Now more than seven years on this prover feels that she has moved on to a new place and while her experiences are recorded here she no longer feels that it is necessary for her to be named. AIDS - A brief history of the disease In 1981 a few unexplained cases of Pneumicystis carinii pneumonia appeared in apparently healthy young men in metropolitan areas of the U.S.. P.C.P. is a rare form of parasitic pneumonia, that previously had only been seen in the very old and very young or in those with compromised immune systems (usually through malnutrition or through the use of immuno-suppressant drugs.) Doctors were also reporting an increase in the number of cases of Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare form of skin cancer, that had also only been known in people with weakened immune systems. Again this condition was appearing in fit, young men. The only connecting factor between these patients was that they were almost exclusively gay and predominantly promiscuously gay. The appearance of opportunistic infections in apparently healthy young men was called Gay Related Immune Deficiency, GRID. By the end of 1983, when Pluto had entered Scorpio, an event associated with plagues by some astrologers, there had been more than 2,500 cases in the United States and cases were appearing all over the developed world. By this time it was clear that the disease was not restricted to gay men. It was also appearing in haemophiliacs, intravenous drug users and the female partners of bisexual men. The disease was renamed Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, AIDS. The first men with the disease had tended to have a large number of sexual partners, a history of many episodes of venereal disease treated with antibiotics, and a substantial use of recreational drugs, especially amyl nitrate (a heart drug often used by gay men to heighten and prolong sexual arousal). The appearance of AIDS in haemophiliacs and intravenous drug users indicated that it was an infectious disease and that the infectious agent was carried in the blood. The appearance of AIDS in female partners of high risk men, indicated that the infectious agent was probably present also in semen. The cases of babies suggested that breast milk might also be a carrier. The obvious conclusion was that all bodily fluids, including saliva, were possible carriers of the infectious agent. What had at first seemed to be restricted to a particular, and somewhat isolated, community; now came to be seen as a plague that would affect everyone. A simple kiss could be a death sentence. This view was confirmed by the African experience. At around the same time that AIDS was appearing in the U.S. and the developed world, a strange new disease was appearing in parts of Africa. This disease caused wasting, hence it came to be called 'Slim', and it opened the unaffected person up to opportunistic infections from which he or she usually died. In Africa 'Slim' was, and still is, killing an enormous number of men and women who should be in the prime of their lives. In Africa AIDS is clearly a heterosexual disease. AIDS and drug abuse have been closely linked since the first appearance of the disease. However, it is in intravenous heroin users that it has taken hold most strongly. In a number of cities in both the developed and developing worlds the problems of heroin addiction and HIV have almost merged into one. The isolation, the secrecy and the numbness of the heroin state, the only way out of unbearable pain, have a resonance with issues important in the AIDS state. In the late Eighties and early Nineties a number of famous people died of AIDS. These included Freddie Mercury and Liberace, but the death that the caused the most attention was that of Rock Hudson. Many of his Hollywood friends took up AIDS as a cause and it became a very public issue. In an effort to reduce infections, and control what was threatening to become a devastating plague, many governments launched massive advertising campaigns to encourage 'safe sex'. For a while it seemed that humanity was in imminent danger of being wiped out by the disease. By the late 1990s much of the terror and hype about AIDS has died away. In the developed world at least, the disease is common only in certain quite restricted, fairly small and well-defined groups. The plague has not come to suburbia as many had feared it would. Even for those with the disease a cocktail of very powerful drugs is significantly extending life expectancy. The mechanism of the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus In the early Eighties research on retro-viruses in France and America found a retro-virus that was later called HIV, which was associated with AIDS. The Human Immuno-deficiency Virus is a retro-viruses, one of a small group of viruses that infiltrate a cell and subvert its genetic mechanism to procreate themselves. RNA is usually a messenger molecule that transfers the genetic code from the DNA in the cell nucleus to the ribosomes where proteins are built up according to the DNA blueprint. HIV contains small pieces of RNA, which work in reverse: they alter the DNA. In HIV infection the virus enters T4 cells in the blood. Once inside the cell the virus releases an enzyme, reverse transcriptase, which causes small pieces of RNA in the virus to produce a relatively short length of DNA. This piece of DNA becomes part of the infected cell's genome and starts producing RNA which will in turn become part of a new virus. In this process the host T4 cell, a leukocyte which has an important role in the working of the immune system, is destroyed and the whole system is severely compromised. Not everyone has been entirely convinced that HIV is the real cause of AIDS. Those most likely to get disease are also those who have compromised immune systems, either through conditions such as haemophilia, or through the abuse of drugs and a history of venereal disease with the resulting antibiotic treatment. Harris Coulter is one of many who have questioned the link. This issue has become impossible to analyse as the presence of antibodies to HIV has now become the definition of AIDS. Thus patients with HIV antibodies dying of pneumonia are classified as a dying of AIDS, while those without the antibodies are classified as a dying of pneumonia. By the definition of the disease all people dying of AIDS have HIV antibodies. 'AIDS - A Brief History of the disease section' contributed by Peter Fraser Observations about AIDS patients Patients often surrender to standard medical interventions or develop monomaniacal approaches to learning all about the disease (and then refuse treatment). Patients may feel that the health care giver is a partner - they must explain every move to the satisfaction of the patient or they will be dismissed. Fear of exposure and feeling unacceptable. A feeling of peace and calm, surrender to a higher power. (This is in contrast to the state of mind present when contracting the illness) Because the illness is almost always kept secret until some great force precipitates its revelation, the patient seemingly has within himself a very low self-esteem, oftentimes masked with a sometimes thick veneer of bravado and self-importance. Once 'out', a great relief is felt and another stage is set. This stage can then be a breakthrough into acceptance and forgiveness - also by loved ones and family. The worst aspect is that what they do touches on three fundamental taboos: sex, shit and homosexuality. Self destructive state, exemplified by numerous sexual partners, sexually transmitted diseases, recreational drugs and prescribed drugs for venereal and linked diseases. i.e. antibiotics, sulphanilamides, steroids and antifungals. Even if this is only partly true, these are some of the constituents of the myth. Miasms and the doctrine of signatures in three nosodes of mixed miasmatic character Tuberculinum is associated in a homoeopath's mind with restless discontent. It is derived from a disease which arises in populations and amongst societies who have been dispossessed. Their fixed posture, their stuck place, (or central delusion) is that their home, land and culture is lost. Therefore, they are restlessly searching for (and cannot find) a new home. Since the disease is associated with violent upheavals such as war, famine and subsequent conditions of deprivation its miasmatic key signature is primarily syphilitic, although Psora (characterized by forsaken feeling, poverty and introspection) is a modulation. Carcinosin is associated in a homoeopath's mind with suppression of ego drives and striving for conformity (in this respect demonstrating its relationship with Lac Humanum). In children an uncompensated state often prevails, typified by difficult, contrary and defiant behaviour, while in adults a suppressed state typified by fastidiousness and niceness is usually seen. It is usual for patients requiring Carcinosin, should they be fastidious, to express it as a drive for matching things. It is derived from diseased tissue which is characterized by overabundant proliferation of cells of one type. The cells represent a monomania of conformity. In a healthy organism, groups of differing cells cooperate together, while in cancerous tissue, the conformity of structure allows for no functional interfacing. It is a monoculture and as such cannot sustain its growth for any length of time. Any system which is composed of sub-units all of a kind is only capable of one set of responses; once internal or external situations change, such a system cannot adopt other modes of reaction. This inflexibility is its undoing. Sycosis (the desire for more and more - in the case of the tumour - of cells) is the leading miasm with strong Syphilitic (destructive) tendencies. From a psychological stand point the Sycotic theme translates into striving coupled with excessiveness (from which guilt is the natural inheritance), while the Syphiltic miasm leads to destructive expressions (so often exhibited by Carcinosin children), self-destructive impulses such as picking at self, both physically and mentally, for instance, endlessly revisiting injustices, wrongs and slights; over fastidiousness; sleeplessness and fear of cancer itself. These worries and concerns tend to be kept under wraps, hidden from the eyes of the world. This latter aspect is mostly of Psoric origin. As Elizabeth Wright-Hubbard suggested: cancer is the marriage of the three miasms (with Aluminium as 'best man'). The AIDS nosode is associated in a homoeopath's mind with boundary issues. Keeping what is in, in; what is out, out. In health the vital force through the medium of the defence system reacts homoeostatically to morbific influences, throwing them off. Keeping what is out, out. Acute manifestation are of this kind, such as fevers, discharges, diarrhoea, pus, and on an emotional level, such as shouting, hitting, moaning, tears. However, should the being become encumbered by disease through a deficiency of acute responses, due to miasmic predisposition or social suppression or drug use, then chronic disease may begin to settle in. In this aspect we note complimentary aspects to Carcinosin and a strongly Psoric colouration. The relationship with Lac Humanum is also noteworthy - here the central issues revolve around individuality versus group conformity, helping others versus thinking about self first, family obligations versus pleasing oneself with inevitable feelings of isolation and accusations of being uncaring. In Rajan Sankaran's provings of Lac Humanum themes of houses, self loathing and rejection feelings also came prominently into the foreground. These features are echoed in the AIDS proving. Not unsurprisingly, human blood and milk have features in common. For in Lac Humanum the theme is about what C.G. Jung termed individuation whereby the individual becomes known to Self and therefore is able to integrate egoic drives with social expectations, while in AIDS the boundary between me and you and the outside world is the central issue. As Carcinosin is primarily about the cost of conformity, and Lac Humanum is about the price of individuality, so AIDS is about the complete breakdown of the defence mechanism. As stated, the key concept is chronic weakness at the boundary. Sex is about as close as our physical and emotional experience can get to dissolving the boundary. Since the myth of AIDS as well as its 'discovery' is bound up with the gay community in San Francisco we will home into this: casual sex with multiple partners is attempting an impossible union, too much thinning of the boundary, and certainly has resulted in frequent venereal infections and associated allopathic treatments as well as providing the pathway of infection. This hunger for intimacy expressing as its perversion in superficial unions may be associated with a low self opinion (and its compensations in arrogance) and isolation feelings. Witness the gay community and its exclusion and suppression by heterosexual folk. Gay also stands for, 'Good As You'! With the arrival of AIDS related symptoms, a sense of desperation, breakdown and decay enters the picture. The Syphilitic note. The breakdown of the immune defence system is mirrored in ecology by such phenomena as the ozone hole, monoculture diseases, (combated by agrochemicals in a manner analogous to the multiple drug therapies employed in the conventional treatment of AIDS) and in sociological terms, by abuse. Here the boundary of the self is violated. It is also worthy of note that Chiron, the asteroid associated by astrologers with wounding and healing was discovered at around the time that AIDS became known. An Evolutionary Map of the Miasms In the beginning there was the continuum (Eden) then separation (the Fall) (this drives to establishment of all religions) Alone & abandoned PSORA underfunction/introspection Proliferation - more and more Destruction - less and less SYCOSIS SYPHILIS hyper expansion hypercontraction i.e. excessive life i.e. excessive death greed hatred PSORA & SYPHILIS Separation abandonment + destruction \u00e8homelessness Tuberculinum SYCOSIS & SYPHILIS Proliferation + destruction \u00e8more and more of less and less e.g. Monoculture Carcinosin SYPHILIS & PSORA Violation and destruction of the boundaries of the self. Immune system breakdown (syphilis) & isolation/estrangement (the psoric note) AIDS The major themes in the AIDS nosode proving Loss of protection/shell/wall. 'I felt that I had lost my wall and my shell, and there was a free flow of emotions both in and out. I was exposed, almost naked, with no control.'

(5) Two cases cured in the provings and their major themes Case 1. Prover A. At the time of receiving the case, she was 29 years of age. She was a student of mine in the final year of study. She had been a counsellor for the past four years. She wore a nose ornament, depicting a lizard. At the close of the interview, I asked her why she had chosen to wear a lizard and she replied that she liked the way they move. Her manner of speech was slow, with long gaps between statements, allowing me ample time to record everything verbatim. This was most unusual, for her usual manner is animated. Her hair was dishevelled, greasy, and her complexion pale. \"Three months ago, a typewriter fell on my head. My homoeopath has prescribed various remedies, such as Arnica, Hypericum and Natrum Muriaticum. In the past, Natrum Muriaticum was prescribed and it has helped me. \"The typewriter incident feels like a watershed. I felt my head being crushed into my shoulders. My memory has been getting worse. I cannot remember what people tell me and I can't find words. I am not able to work or study. I am getting very anxious about money. I am feeling disempowered. Childhood \"There was no one to respond to my fears or illnesses. I had to learn to lock everything out. Whenever I felt bad, I would go for a run. I was into athletics. I always kept moving. It was almost like punishing myself. I still feel like this, 'I will beat this, and then I will be okay; if I keep on going I will be okay.' \"My father sexually abused me from as far back as I can remember. He went on doing it until I left home. My first memory is of being about three and in the bath. My father is jerking off and semen splashes on my face. \"When I am shocked I can feel semen on my face and I feel that others will be able to see it too. \"Often when I wake up, I feel crushed, compressed. \"I can only sleep if I lie with one hand over my heart and one on my throat. \"My mother knew what was going on. She colluded with my father. She had sex with me too. I think of her as a cardboard cutout character. I am revolted by her. \"I had a recurrent dream of being stuck in the birth canal with putrid pus in my nose and throat. Another recurrent dream that I have is of being a foetus, as though I have been just born and I can see the planet Earth beyond me. It is very beautiful. My umbilicus is cut and I want to tie it but I can't reach it and there is no one to ask for help. \"I was never given guidelines for what was right - only for what was wrong. She starts crying. She buries her head in her arms as if to protect herself from blows. \"I feel cut off from people. I feel that there is something that I must do but I don't know what it is. I learnt to be careful not to say what I liked, or who I liked. If I named my friends, then I would not be allowed to play with them. At Christmas time, I was told about the presents which they did not get me. They said that I had not been good enough. \"My mother said that I could only have pocket money if I did X, Y or Z. I still get very anxious about money. I used to steal money from her. I still feel angry and violent about her attitude. When I was 12, and right up to the age of 17, when I left home, I did not talk. I felt that if I did say anything I would fuck up. It was the only power I had, to be silent. \"When I was 8, I developed temporary paralysis of my legs. \"I couldn't move because of the pain in my pelvis and vagina. My mother did not believe that I was ill. She said that I was pretending. A mother is the one you should be able to turn to when you're in trouble! \"I was so frightened of my father that when I heard him coming up the steps to my bedroom I used to shit myself. I still feel that people will smell this on me. \"I used to dream of a river with shit and dead bodies in it. My head was floating in this river. It was alive. \"I used to dream of terrorists. \"I used to be frightened of the dark. \"My father's violence was unpredictable. One day, he would be nice to me and the next he would hit me about the head, in my stomach or on my legs. He used to lock me out of the house whenever he felt like it. \"We moved from country to country many times. My father was very brilliant in his career. \"I was always lonely. It was like concentric rings of isolation. \"I wanted to have a brother or sister. When I asked him why he had never had another child, he replied that he wouldn't make the same mistake twice. \"I used to tell people that I had a twin who had died. \"I had stomach cramps from the age of 8 and ulcers were diagnosed when I was 12. I vomited blood. \"I used to feel, 'what haven't I done, what do I need to do so that they will stop doing this?' \"I do not let up on myself. I am driven by a feeling that I could have done better. \"I can't trust and I am frightened of taking risks. \"I am frightened of rejection and I move away. I feel that I need to protect the people that I like from me, from the horrible things which are inside me. \"My happiest times have been living on my own. The best was when I lived in a tiny cottage in the Scottish mountains completely alone. It was only then that I no longer made searches under my bed and realized that I had been compulsively checking out my bedroom for all of my adult life. \"Wherever I went to live, my father would follow me. He would do or say nothing but would tail me in his car when I cycled into work or he turned up in the restaurant at which I was waitressing. He would just sit there and watch me. \"Last year, I told him that if he continued to follow me I would tell the police. He slapped me around the head so violently that I was concussed, saying 'take that to the police.' I have not seen him since. \"Three months ago, a typewriter fell on my head. Two weeks after the typewriter fell on my head, I was feeling so angry and frustrated that I buried my head in my pillow and growled. Usually I scream my anger into my pillow. On the basis of the presenting symptoms, the running (her past time and the lizard's mode of escape) and on the understanding that head injuries are part of her chronic case, I prescribed Helleborous 1M. The constitutional background for this rests on two inner state rubrics: delusion, that she has done wrong and neglected her duty - the message she received and believed to be true, from her father. What Helleborous does not cover, are the feelings of self disgust: shit, semen and the 'feeling that I need to protect the people that I like from me, from the horrible things which are inside me.' This state seemed to me, to be best covered by Lac Caninum, the remedy which I later prescribed. This was the background to the proving and the further and dramatic improvements which she then experienced. I shall let her verbatim account (taken from a taped interview) fill in the details. This recording was made four months after the proving in which she participated. It is not in chronological sequence, thus her first statements relate to the proving of the AIDS nosode and Lac Caninum. \"One of the difficulties arising out of the changes since the AIDS proving is that I don't have the same aversion to being touched, so now I have to fill in all the gaps. Before I could switch off in some way. A sexual relationship felt possible, and now it feels not impossible, but it feels that I don't want it, I just want to be held, to feel safe. I have really noticed it, what a difference it makes, just to be held. I think that is the thing that I am really struggling with. M: How was it before? \"I have always had a feeling that I will contaminate other people and that is why I must stay away from them. And also feeling that I am contaminated. With the Lac Caninum, it was particularly around my periods and around ovulation that it was heightened, I just needed to wash, the only thing I could do was to sit in the bath, but then I couldn't touch myself, and I would have to look at the wall, it was so bizarre, because I remember sitting in the bath thinking: that's what that thing is where they separate the fingers' and I couldn't let any part of me touch each other and I've got quite a small bath so it was quite difficult, and just feeling so completely disgusting. I couldn't touch myself to wash, I just had to submerge myself up to my neck. M: I suggested that you take Lac Caninum 200, which you did. \"And the other thing was that I couldn't sleep. We were talking about how I sleep - one hand on my neck and one hand where my heart is, almost like protecting my chakras, face down. I took the Lac Caninum, and all the stuff that I had around feeling that I had semen on my face and stuff around my mother and oral sex - I had that whole thing going on around my mouth and my face, and couldn't be seen - that initially disappeared and then came back a bit but wasn't as strong as it had been. M: Helleborous hadn't actually changed this? \"No, the stuff around my head overtook that, because it was physically and mentally disabling. The thing that I use all the time is my head, to think, that is the way I function and that is how I have managed in the world, because I think quite quickly, and suddenly I couldn't do it, it was really freaky for me. Suddenly I didn't have access to that which guaranteed my safety. The other thing that guaranteed my safety was physical activity and sport and I couldn't do that either, I couldn't climb. I have to be outside and have to be doing something. It was really important and has always been really important, and it is my one escape route, as well, to run, to jump and to rock climb. Immediately after that dose of Helleborous I felt different and could think again. My room-mate at the bed and breakfast commented that I had changed colour from grey to pink and my hair returned to normal - it had been all matted. It had actually started going grey and in time that changed back to normal. M: So then, after having had Lac Caninum there was a gap of a couple of months, where things were going well, and then you banged your head again. The Helleborous state returned, muzzy thinking and inability to express yourself. \"I am always banging my head! \"I gave you another dose of Helleborous 1M. Then we went back to the same symptoms in the bath and the state of self loathing - you phoned me up and said, 'I need another dose of Lac Caninum!' which you had. Response to the remedy proving \"I think the curative action of the proving (of the AIDS nosode) is that I did have a sense of feeling that I belonged with people that I had never had before, I had always felt like I was outside and unacceptable, so all the while, whilst I might look like I was part of the group, I actually felt myself on the outside. I know that lots of people have that, but with me it was very strong. I don't think I ever had any sense of belonging until I did the proving. I was talking about that yesterday, that the one time in my life when I really felt part of a group was that time of the proving. M: So Lac Caninum took you a little way in this direction, but where it really came together was in the proving. \"Not the same, when I had Lac Caninum, I didn't feel that everybody was looking at me with disgust when I walked down the street. I felt I was entitled to walk down the street, I wasn't feeling that every single person who walked past me felt critical of me or disgusted by me. M: So when we did the proving in May. What happened? \"When we were sitting, waiting for the effects, I had this vision: I felt that I was in a tank of water, then I realized I was in the sea. I felt very comfortable. A diver went past, I don't like the noise they make - I find it creepy. I was walking in the water, not swimming. A horse walked past - usually I don't like them, they're unpredictable but I wasn't bothered. There was a dark tunnel and I walked in, a vicious fish just passed me by, no fear attached, no awareness of going anywhere. Suddenly I came out into a bright, bright light, the area was like a dome, of the kind you put over a clock, light was coming through windows in the top. There was a gold coffin and it was at this point that I felt really frightened and anxious, didn't want to be there, the light felt uncomfortable. The gold coffin in the middle of the room was encrusted with jewels. I climbed into it, pulled the lid down over me, all these jewels and gold coins fell down on top of me. I woke up on a beach, my top half was on the beach while my lower half was a fish with waves lapping over my tail. I felt contented and at peace. \"The night of the proving, I slept really well, like I haven't slept in ages. Very comfortably. I remember my dreams were very colourful, I remember a whole load of flowers. Usually my dreams are very unlike that, basically, very dark, very violent, as if there is something following me, there is blackness and I don't know what is going on. Constant nightmares rather than dreams. The thing that has happened is that the nightmares have completely stopped. And one more thing that has stopped is of always feeling crushed, like there is a heavy weight and of being sexually tortured in some way. M: Which nightmares? \"There was one of being a foetus and not being attached and trying to tie my umbilical cord up. I can see the planet earth in the distance, it looks very beautiful. I am this foetus with its torn umbilical cord, and I know that if I tie it up I'll be OK, but I don't have the manual dexterity or the ability to even reach that cord. Then the other one occurs at times in counselling or times where I have disclosed information about my parents and what happened then, whenever I felt that I'd made myself vulnerable in some way. This was the dream: I walk into the garage and my father is making something, and I say, 'What are you making?' He replies, 'You'll find out soon enough'. Then I walk out, and go for a walk in a field where there is a great big dip like a bowl shape and I get to the top and he's put up a crucifix. The depression is filled with a whole heaving mass of people, everyone I've ever known, like, even walked past in the street. And the people who I know best are in the front row glaring at me. My father pins me up on the crucifix which he has made and rips a foetus out, which he then sews onto my left breast. I don't know how to rescue the baby because he's severed the umbilical cord. From the point of view of everyone who's looking at me, the message is that what he's doing is appropriate in terms of what I've done. But I don't know what it is that I've done. I've had this nightmare since I was about 10 or 12. \"And the other thing that went after the proving, is a lot of anal bleeding and vaginal pain - which I realize dates back to tearing. \"There's another thing that's changed, which feels new and strange, which is that I feel better in company, whereas before I would always feel bad in company. Now it feels very painful being away from people, being by myself. \"I used to think that I didn't have the language to express 'me', the things that I felt ... I didn't have the experience of going to people and saying, well, in fact I do need your help ... I do this more easily now ... I used to think that I needed to make everyone like me, like if I only did this, maybe people would like me. \"Now, I just think that some people don't like me and it's tough, it's not an issue in the way that it was, that I would be annihilated if somebody didn't like me and I didn't do the right thing, because that might be the one person I needed help from. M: And hugging, contact? \"I don't throw up when people hug me. It's quite an advantage actually, it's kind of detrimental to relationships! But yes, I used to be very nauseous around touch and my osteopath really noticed it, that she was able to work on me much more. Before I would have a delayed reaction to the session, over time we had found a way of working but I would still vomit afterwards, maybe even a day later. \"I think what is happening is that when I initially did the proving, it was like being given the gift of seeing what is beyond, what it on the other side of all this confusion and terror. Is this what the world can be like? Is this what it's like to be comfortable around people? Over time I feel less comfortable than I did when I actually did the proving, but it is almost like I needed to have that experience, to know it was possible. I don't know how to explain this, but now that I know it is possible to go beyond where I was, to a place which is much more comfortable, it is almost like I can move back a bit and can make the journey without the aid of the remedy. Knowing that is painful because I can't have it all the time, but if I had that all the time I wouldn't value it in the same way. I wouldn't have the sense of how precious that is to me, to have that experience. \"I feel a bit like a small child. I think before I felt that there was this small child in this adults body, screaming it's head off to be heard. That was one of the things I felt I carried, this giant scream around in me all the time. I don't have that now. I guess it's the difference between vulnerable and open: I feel like a more open small child who will be able to receive and take things whereas before I just felt completely vulnerable, and terrified, making sure that I kept people out, and yet desperately wanting to be in contact with them as well. Case 2. This prover (of Mariette Honig) was a man in his early fifties. His diary didn't give much information about his state of mind. But he did say that he felt extremely tired every winter and every year he got flu in the Christmas holidays. The proving took place on the 5th of December, so he was already feeling his usual weariness and tiredness. I knew him to be a hard workingman, honest, quite extroverted without ever revealing anything about his own feelings. He liked to play the clown, to keep the atmosphere light. His remarks could be very witty, sometimes a bit coarse. It was obviously an act he needed to hide behind. His report after the proving: \"I had a wonderful night's sleep. Relaxing dreams (didn't remember what they were). I got up feeling very fit and went for a run in the dunes. I felt wonderful, no tiredness, I am ready to take on the world! This feeling has stayed with him ever since. Neither the tiredness nor the flu came back. He felt well the following winter too. He says. \"Everything feels more structured, there is plenty of time to do the things I want to do\" (the amount of work and study he manages to pack into one day is quite extraordinary). So he was very happy with the proving and he didn't say much more about it, apart from the occasional remark that he still felt absolutely fine. It wasn't until two years later, when we talked about the proving again, that he told me that he had been sexually abused in his teenage years. So I asked him if he would be prepared to talk about it. This is his story. \"I was born during the war and I have always had the impression that my father didn't really want me, as if I was too much. My father used to beat me whenever I ventured to give my opinion about anything, no matter what. My father never gave me any support or encouragement, never came to watch me play football, never took any interest in my results at school. He always said I was good for nothing or he simply pretended that I didn't exist. \"That is why my motto became: 'I'll show you what I can do. I will see this through to the very end.' And this is what he has done. No job is too hard for him, no request too difficult. He will always work at it until he has mastered it. He runs a successful business and is always ready to take on extra work. A few years ago he had a nervous breakdown because of financial difficulties, his brothers and sisters all ignored him and he felt very low. What finally lifted him out of his depression was the arrival of a tiny, stray kitten. \"I was at home all day, moping around, and then this little kitten arrived. It kept coming up to me, purring and nudging me and suddenly I felt: I am accepted, I am part of this world again. Childhood When he was two years old he had an acute attack of fever in the spring. It started with shivering, then a very high fever and then blisters and ulcers in his mouth. This lasted for several weeks and nobody knew what it was. He got antibiotics and even a blood transfusion, but nothing helped. Finally it cleared up, but it came back every year in the spring until he was 14 years old. Sometimes it was so bad that he was taken to hospital, where he was put into quarantine. \"I had to spend weeks in bed, all alone in a little room, cut off from the rest of the world. My mother would come and see me every day, but my father didn't come once. At the age of 14 these mysterious attacks of fever and ulcers stopped but he has always felt progressively more tired as the winter wore on. He felt that it took him all summer to store up enough energy again to get through the next winter. He had difficulty studying at school, (his father didn't help by reminding him every day that he was no good and would never get anywhere in life). Later on he went to boarding school where he was sexually abused by one of the masters during 'extra lessons'. This went on till he was 16. He never dared to tell anyone. He felt disgusted and ashamed. After he was married it took him years before he dared to tell his wife. Deep down he always doubted whether he could trust her. This feeling would creep in during the most intimate moments and he could never get rid of it, although it bothered him a lot. Follow up Two years after the proving. Since the proving this feeling of distrust has disappeared, and he now feels comfortable enough to talk about his experiences. He also told me that at parties he often used to be approached by men. He had always hated this. Since the proving this has stopped. Now he finds that women are attracted to him, which he is much happier about. He is much more open. He still jokes a lot, but in a more natural manner and the sharpness has gone. The proving has brought into focus the anger he still carried towards his father and he is now coming to terms with this, two years after the proving. His physical tiredness and the frequent episodes of flu have disappeared. Three years after the proving. He still takes the remedy about once a year when he finds himself becoming very hurried, wanting to take on much more work than he can comfortably manage. Within 24 hours of taking the remedy the hurriedness disappears, the wrinkles in his forehead get smoothed out (comment from his wife) and he takes on a relaxed attitude to life again. He said. \"All my life I have hidden the fact that I felt so unsure of myself behind a front of 'just watch me, I can do it'. Nobody ever saw my doubts and uncertainties. Now this is changing. \"Even before this proving, where so many people dreamt of houses, I had often said to myself: 'The foundations aren't right'. Now I feel the foundations have been put in order.' Main themes of several cases treated successfully with the Aids nosode History of sexual abuse. Powerless in the hands of people who are in control, people who can violate your boundaries. Nowhere is safe. The people who should be offering safety and security are the very people who either ignore you, or even worse, betray you. Sensation of isolation and estrangement. Comfort is found in a bond with a special (innocent or young) friend, dog, kitten etc. who understands the longing for recognition and love. Persevering, strong, responsible.

Sensation of growth, of blossoming. Sensation of flying gently, of floating, of being uplifted. Sensation of being like a cloud. Image of a white billowing cloud, with a flower in its centre.

Journeying into the past, remembering childhood experiences. Other observations One of the male provers, who worked in a laboratory, volunteered to have a 'live' blood analysis done every day for one week, starting the day before the proving. The results, as seen under a microscope, are shown below. Interesting to note that the distribution of the blood corpuscles changed dramatically two days after the proving. This formation is called 'stacking' which indicates a humoural defence reaction. Prover's blood prior to taking the remedy Prover's blood after taking the remedy This picture lasted for three days, after which it returned to normal. Observation by analyst: The following reaction was observed: Hypochromic anaemia with anisiocytosis and poikilocytosis. The remedy appears to affect the production of the glutation-reductase enzyme in the erythrocytes (red corpuscles). A shortage of this enzyme might cause:- Hypochromic anaemia (lack of colour) with anisiocytosis (irregular size) and poikilocytosis (distortions of the membrane of the red corpuscles).- Idiocy). The M.R. Vaccine proving In order to verify whether the above mentioned proving symptoms gave a clear picture of the essence of the nosode itself, rather than the personal characteristics of the patient whose blood was used, we arranged another proving at the School of Homoeopathy. This remedy was made up at Nelsons Homoeopathic Pharmacy from the blood of another terminal AIDS patient: Mr M.R. The proving symptoms were so similar to the first proving that they will not be included in this book. Once again the most outstanding features were: Mind Immediate reaction of floating, happiness, playfulness. Able to fit lots of work into a very short space of time. Or the opposite: extreme heaviness and sluggishness. Concern about children, needing protection. Dreams of huge houses with many staircases and dark passages. Dreams of threats of violence. Loss of money, jewellery, possessions. Loss of words, cannot express himself. Angry with everybody and desire to kill. Anger at injustice. Anger about being 'subjected' to this proving.

Decide to simplify my life by not encumbering it with charitable obligations. A feeling of resolution is dawning at last! The phrase, 'youth, beauty, love,' kept repeating in my mind over and over again. Very sharp today, got heaps of work done. Unhurried and untroubled. I feel content and happy with the world - emotionally connected, much more settled. I noticed last night that I was in and out of the room doing what I wanted to do and being part of the group as well. I felt so positive. I suddenly felt strength, and it was like somebody had plonked my feet into the ground. As if someone had put a strengthening thing around my spine and I felt stronger and more together. I feel self-sufficient and confident about doing my own thing. I feel really good, and I feel part of the whole group. Late for an appointment, which is unusual for me, normally I will panic at being late and rush so I'm not. Relaxed on the journey, I usually passenger with my foot clamped on an imaginary brake and end up with a tense headache. I feel quite happy, really good, as if I have more energy. I am enjoying being alone, usually I don't like to be alone, since the remedy I have been glad to be alone. He has the feeling that there is more time for everything. He has a lot of work on and is a bit 'stressed out', but even so he is feeling great. I feel much calmer. When I arrived I was quite upset because I had just been told that a friend had died. I am concerned, but not in a way that feels overwhelming. I have also noticed that I am usually gabbling, and that has calmed down quite a lot. While driving had an accident. Not had accident before, it threw me. I acted calmly. Just got back into my car, felt a bit kind of numb, shock state. Could have been more freaked out normally. Carried on driving OK. That evening drove to London for the first time, navigated on my own. Took on a lot. Reactions good when I had accident. In balance quite a positive reaction to accident. I did sleep incredibly well the first two nights, which is unusual for me, especially when camping. I woke up quite early, and I felt quite wide awake, although I'd had little sleep. Usually I'd enjoy lying in for a bit, but I was wanting to get up. I was feeling terribly efficient, taking the tent down. By the afternoon I felt above it all, serene, even rested... was able to listen to landlord being racist and let it pass over my head instead of getting worked up. Boyfriend left for a few days. Normally I get lonely when this happens. This time, just about managed to say goodbye to him, very casual. Glad to be on my own. Feels nice, feels healthy. Calm feeling. I do feel very calm, at ease.

A feeling of oneness with my fellow man and the whole of the universe. I felt exceptionally close to my family and friends. All I could think of was: youth, beauty, peace.

Elated, Floating, Ungrounded, Growing, Bubbles I was reading someone's hand and the analogy I used was of a bubble in water and rising to the surface. Feel great. Sing to myself in the street. Love being on my own. Went to see a flat that I heard about yesterday, through someone at work. When I saw it, it felt like it could be home. It was a huge Jacobean manor house with loads of rooms, but I'd have my own space. I'd like to get it. Feel good, high, excited, enthused about life. I felt not completely divorced from what was happening but I felt small compared to the enormity of what was happening. The was a gentleness and a waftiness, and this was part of a bigger picture so that it was actually like an arty film. Exaltation, elation. Fluctuating between morose and high. Got a new lover - my first for 5 years. Terrifying but exciting too. I felt like I had to keep my feet on the ground, the only way to describe it would be a as a delusion really - a tribal one; Cheyenne with tepees and people and it was pleasant and the sensation was very, very real to me and I had to force myself to get in the car and drive it, and I had to keep myself grounded. I was really conscious all night about having to remember my dreams and having to disentangle whether I was in a dream, whether it was a dream, that sort of half-conscious state. On waking he saw a vertical blue strip. This changed into a big blue patch with dark blue spots and on the left side a light blue light. Also saw transparent blue squares like yesterday. On waking, in half sleep state, sees beautiful green colours, dotted with yellow spots. It changes into green squares, edged with yellow. Then a dark blue background with light blue squares. He never saw this before. He sometimes used to see blue colours, but never in clear shapes like this. Everything felt natural, tribal natural - like the south sea islands with water but natural bare foot and nothing much underneath with flowers but natural with white, green and water. Very spacey. This evening danced a lot, enjoyed it, felt like a free spirit, strong and independent. When I was driving home I felt quite reckless, I had to keep on bringing myself back. It was a floaty sort of feeling and I had to remind myself that I was in control here. There was a popping sensation - like a flower had formed a seed pod and then it popped and that was fun. It was a sensation like a bubble going up and then it popped and was all colourful, like a rainbow, and it left a wetness over everything. The growth thing, things coming out and then it popping. I feel above it all, I feel that I am floating, I feel disconnected, I felt I had to ground myself, the world seems an exciting and strange place. And then I saw an image. If you see something that is a circle in front of you, you can see the curve but I have the idea that it was something that was so big that you only see the flat bit of it, this image of, bars would be the wrong word, they were not as heavy as bars, more like black lines coming down nice and easy. Its very hazy and soft focus, and with a cream white background with the black bars coming down, not very fast. That image was very strong. A sense of growing. The image of the cloud that I saw was going to the left. The image was a billowy cloud and I had the sensation of being like the cloud and gradually in the middle there was an orange brown part and gradually the whole cloud started to feel more like a flower. It had a very gentle feel to it and gentle was the word that seemed to be coming over very strongly. Gentle and mild and very pleasant. All senses heightened. It seemed as if the grass was undulating and then it expanded a bit. The grass wafting around with the wind and changing colours in front of us. Everyone I speak to on the phone says how perky and fun to be with I sound. I have been having low moments but they pass before I have time to get into a melancholy mood. Talked to a friend about my mother without even a tear in my eye - incredible! I feel full of get-up-and-go, anything seems possible. Full of drive, steaming through my commitments. I feel less deluged with demands, it's more than that I can cope, there is enough time to do everything it's necessary to do. A bit more relaxed. Moods fluctuating/vacillating between morose and exhilaration. During meditation: suddenly felt my energy body rising above my physical body, then my head opened and golden angels ascend from it, forming a powerful choir above me. The scene disappeared as quickly as it came. Spoke to a friend on the phone, who said 'what's happened to you? You're like a different woman - all high and giggly, like a space cadet'. It's true, I feel above it all, as if the harsh realities of the world can't touch me, they just register and bounce off. What attracted me to that fish was that it was caught off West Coast of Canada - this made me want it. Imagined in my mind that the fish was wild and clean and from a wonderful pollution free environment. Playful, Remembered childhood, Expansive Exhilaration, frivolity. There was a sense of frivolity of fun, of wanting to play. Burst into tears of relief and joy at some good news. Felt at one with my brother yet very alone. Very strong recollections of unhappy childhood. Sadness and suffering at the hands of unaware foster parents. Feel very happy though, and realize the only way to live is through creativity, catharsis and joy. Very strong feelings of empathy and sense of change being possible in our lifetimes in relation to our children. I've been travelling psychically through a lot of very early childhood stuff. Within 5 or 10 minutes, I felt stoned, numb around the mouth, heady, giggly, talkative. This lasted for half an hour, then I got very sleepy. Journeying into the past, remembering childhood experiences. Feeling provocative or niggly or persecuted in some way. I felt playful in the extreme. I am playful anyway, but after the remedy, I felt very playful. If I could give you an image. You have all spoke about houses and rooms; it was as if I had moved. I had fully moved into my house and I can go right up to the window of my house. This isn't a dream or anything, this is an image. Whereas some people are saying they felt persecuted so they would go back into themselves, I actually felt quite safe to go right up to my very extremities and what the hell, it doesn't matter what people say and I can go right up to the window and right into the bay and move right round. So it is the opposite of what everyone is saying. I felt that there were people who just went terribly serious and I had to move right back from anybody who was serious because the message was that life is too short and the house is too big. Let's explore every room. A very expansive feeling. But I didn't feel critical about it, which probably I would be, so that was unusual. I didn't feel 'aren't they being miserable'. Journeying back to childhood - childhood memories. Recollections of the past; school and unhappy childhood. Emotionally open and relaxed. Extravagant, Wanton, Invulnerable, Reckless I wanted to do something wanton and sensual and extravagant, last night I felt frustrated - I wanted to swim naked in the sea or ride a horse naked or something naked. Normally feel easily rejected, now feel great. I was singing to myself in the street, loved being on my own. I felt like doing something mischievous. I wanted to do something naked and extravagant. I had no embarrassment with nakedness. This is a big deal for me - it feels as though barriers between me and other people can come down with this man. (Talking about new relationship.) Sympathetic, Sensitive Feelings of empathy. Desire to share honestly and with feeling. Feeling weepy. Things are getting to me. Normally couldn't give a damn about such things. I try not to get too involved in the people that I see in my job, but today I was really touched by an old lady's plight, and spent a long time on the phone sorting things out for her. Completely beyond my brief, but I felt really sorry for her. Everything still looking crystal clear. All senses, hearing/smell heightened. Massive, Passive, Slow, Can't be bothered Feels listless, can't concentrate in the afternoon. A hugely busy day at work, but no trouble coping. Emotionally much more settled - even too settled - I find myself driving very slowly and sort of dreaming my way through the day, but still concentrating on the essentials. Doesn't have enough time to do everything he wants to do. Feel well, although I do seem much slower than my usual pace. I feel like I've more time. I've laid on the sofa and just let my mind wander - have not felt I had the time to do this for about 18 months. I had a very strong image of an elephant and the feeling was a gentleness and a passivity but also this enormous physical structure. I had a feeling of slow motion and gentle movement - very dreamy - the thing that I kept feeling was this sense of enlargement rather like when you are delirious and your hands are big. I felt that, again on the left side, in my brain, like I had this sort of lump or something heavy, that was acting like a plumb line all through my body., I felt as though I was totally calm and centred; grounded. A feeling of a lump of something heavy in my brain, but it felt like a line all the way through. Mentally very slow. Can't be bothered with anything, would like to lie down and read, - something sedentary. Still very slow, don't seem to be able to rush around, not worried about being on time or finishing a job. Very slow, though very relaxed. Whilst reading a story to daughter, felt quite ill, voice seemed at a distance, felt oppressed, hot, slow. Better lying down. Listless in afternoon and evening. While we were sitting in the circle I became quite convinced that the person on my right hand side, was actually a very large feather duvet and I had that feeling like when you get too hot in bed and my left side was quite cool, as if it was sitting out of the duvet and felt fine. But the right hand side was hot, light, frothy and prickly hot. Fragile, Weak, Exposed, Shy Exquisite and precious mental pain - I had no shell for protection. Weepy - ridiculous, pathetic. Felt very exposed - I had no shell to protect me. Over sensitive. Exceptionally sympathetic to the point of tears - weepy. 'Things are getting to me, usually couldn't give a damn - I am feeling very fragile.' Feel quite anxious, but happy in my work and life. In the afternoon, sitting in car, I felt very small in the world, like a speck - trees were towering above - felt almost pressed back in my seat. Lasted about half an hour. Short staffed at work, having to work 6 days this week. Resent it a bit (the working). Used to be able to say when I was to work. Feel less assertive. Feelings of being awkward and shy - averse company and talking. The remedy initially made me feel really good, happy and there was so much clarity. The initial high feeling gradually wore off. I didn't like the busy, anxious dreams, the very bad period pains and bleeding, the skin eruptions on my face, the lack of libido, turning into a weak person - on the mental level, being forgetful. It seemed to push me into the polarity state of what I really am. I'm disappointed at antidoting remedy but could not leave it any longer. Lacking in self confidence. I felt that I had lost my wall, my protection and my shell, and there was a free flow of emotions both in and out. I was exposed, almost naked, with no control. Dependent, Panic, Can't cope Began to panic about being rejected in the middle of the night. Panic lasted all day. Feel in need of loads of reassurance. Mentally very tired, anxious to get things done quickly. Feelings of financial insecurity. Started talking about how I felt, really emotional and in a strange state. All came out from being calm. Ended up really crying. Boyfriend said I seemed stressed and uptight and a bit odd. Sobbing and feeling weird about life all of a sudden. All confused. Insecure, weepy and depressed. First evening alone for a long time and I don't like it. Really clingy. Crying when man quoted price of a new boiler. Very unusual for me, usually laid back about such matters. Encountering new people face to face, felt awkward and shy. Didn't feel comfortable with superficial small talk. Imagined everything I said sounded wrong, gabbling. The food thing is where it focuses for me. When we have our meals together I feel that I am getting this childhood thing; I am being nourished. And this morning I left my lodgings without having breakfast deliberately for the pleasure of coming here and having breakfast with everyone and lighting the fire. What a horrible day. Car battery flat, went into 'it's the end of the world' syndrome - dependent, nobody loves me. Cried. Struggled on against desire to go home and howl. Later, much help offered and problem resolved. Felt the universe was on my side again. Going down into the hold with all the people (to disembark from ferry). I had a vision of it being like my dream of the cinema stairway. In the hold hundreds of us had to squeeze past lorries etc., to get up to the car and the front. Began to feel panicky again. Palpitations, breathing fast. Felt threatened, wanted out but had to keep going. Great to get out. Dreading trip back, trying not to think about it. In the bunk bed in the cabin (ferry trip to Ireland) felt slightly panicky. Had to stop myself thinking disastrous thoughts, kept telling myself that I could just get up, open the door and go up on deck. Slept very little, very restless, hot legs returned. Emotionally connected. However, when homework returned, due for repeat, felt absolutely crestfallen - thrown into a state of sheer panic and feelings of failure, inadequacy, and anxiety (heart palpitations). Feelings were around fear of authority (elders, institutions, school, judgement) also very emotional. Was 'wiped out' by the period. Could do no work. Just laid in the garden all afternoon. Slight feelings of guilt about it. What I have been noticing is that I want someone else to feed me. It is very difficult for me to feed myself at the moment, as if I am a helpless infant in a cradle. And I've also been reading a midwifery book, which makes me cry nearly every page, but I still have to read it and so the idea of very early childhood is quite strong for me at the moment. Seizure of panic in a management meeting (heart palpitations). Feel pretty sorry for myself, with some justification I think! (Suffering from an acute.) During bilious attack. Felt miserable and shaky too ill to light a fire or make a cup of tea. Just lay in bed with the radio turned down, almost too low to hear so that it didn't irritate me Why do they have to speak so loud? A can't cope feeling. I need someone to look after me but can't bring myself to ask - too much effort. Confused, Forgetful, Making mistakes A bit sad today, can't work out why. Lethargy and confusion - feels that she has forgotten something, or to do something. At work I nearly gave someone the wrong animal after its operation. The weekend girl put two black/white cats in the wrong cages. I should have been more careful, it was my responsibility. Felt bad about it. Bit distracted. Time has gone very quickly. Cannot concentrate on studying in the afternoon and evening. Concentration poor. Continually sensing that I have forgotten something or forgotten to do something. Feel very confused. Inability to formulate thoughts and words properly. This forgetfulness is not me. Usually very organized. Also finding I lose words. Know what I want to say but the odd word just vanishes. Forgetfulness. Forgot any clean pants. Put my top on back to front. Realized that I had put my trousers on back to front as well. Mind going completely blank. Forget immediately that which I have just done or seen, brushed teeth, poured water for tea, etc. Keep forgetting things. Forgetful of things I normally remember. I am working very slowly and carefully, otherwise I would be making mistakes because my mind is just not on my work. Felt exhausted and confused. Very emotional exchange with a client. Immense feelings of empathy. Felt like praying and crying. Restless, Frustrated Frustrated about authority issues. Feelings of anger - desire independence. Felt nervy and uptight today, same feelings as before. I found that I was very restless last night - noise was intensified - I couldn't sit with the others. Restless generally. Feels very restless. Feels continuously restless inside. Feels very hazy, as if floating, and restless. His first impression was that his dreams were 'more coherent'. Irritable, Easily offended Woke irritable, tired and heavy. Then energetic and jolly until after lunch. Despondency about finding a house set in - weepy in the afternoon. Difficult to study. Feel emotionally negative during headache. Felt very angry with husband this morning. I am going to divorce him and live on my own with the children. These was no provocation - it's just how I feel. In the afternoon, don't feel angry, feel discontented; my husband is quite an anxious person, he tends to pass a lot of anxiety on to me; I feel like I've carried his anxiety for too long. Great feelings of anger and impatience, triggered by having to wait one and a half hours for an appointment. Depressed and irritated at this course of events. Make lots of mistakes on the computer today, and get bloody irritable about it! Feeling irritable. Weepy, worse admonition. My husband came in and I was about to use the telephone and he said 'You are not about to use the phone again are you?' So I felt guilty, huffy and did not phone. For some reason I am really irritable today, mostly at inanimate objects: the car, packaging on a packet of biscuits, the computer and so on. Glad to get into bed at the end of the day without smashing something. Went in to work an hour later than they asked me to. I just did not want to be there. Worked 1.00 until 8.45. Felt myself getting more and more irritable with people telephoning the vets. Later that day found I was getting very irritated by the clients at work, I did not want to be there doing that job. Went home and was irritable with husband. Why? Running on automatic pilot. Feel pissed off. Insensitive, Withdrawn, Wants to be alone Desire for space and time to reflect and be myself. Felt very withdrawn. I really want my own space, but don't have it. I want to spend time on my own, have my own home. Felt quiet and withdrawn in morning, felt different to others again. Wanted solitude, couldn't get it. I usually like company. What was very noticeable with me was that immediately after the remedy I felt light and laughing, and very, very sociable and things were hilarious. I started off really laughing and then all of a sudden something sort of kicked in and dropped down and I felt incredibly serious, even when others were just laughing and laughing. Incredibly serious. Kind of nice. A kind of calm serious. And I went very, very introverted and generally I have been feeling very unlike my usual 'desire for company' self. I felt like I wanted to be alone and I've been going off on my own and feeling really good about being on my own. Normally, that is not that comfortable a feeling for me. But I actually feel a great strength in me now; a real desire for it. It has been very different. Want to get away from everyone. When on my own want to be with everyone again. Absence of sensitivity towards others. Had the desire to be alone. Felt different to and separate from other people. Felt very individual. I feel rather uncommunicative, as if I were winding down. One of my patients came round to see me because she was forsaken. I didn't notice she was forsaken - unusual. Didn't pick it up. She did not actually say she was forsaken. Came round next day and told me. I had not picked it up. Isolated, Frightened, Loss of identity During the day he had a strange feeling while the spindryer was making a lot of noise. He suddenly felt 'I don't belong here at all'. I had just had a vision of a black hole in the distance, with a sort of spider webbing coming out of it. Felt distant from wife. Feelings of abandonment and lack of love. Feel there is not enough time for closeness and intimacy. Aggravated by paperwork at office. Telephoned a friend. Another friend (my best friend) was in background of conversation but did not speak to me. Felt hurt by that. The first thing I noticed after taking the remedy was before hand I had been very sociable and after taking the remedy and about 10 or 15 minutes after, I started to feel very self conscious and kind of almost paranoid and I went and sat in the corner. I wanted to defend myself in a way that I hadn't thought about but I didn't really want any contact with people for about an hour. Very soon after taking the remedy. Not connecting with people - feelings of isolation - felt, 'nobody loves me'. Feelings of loss, abandonment. Resolve to take each day as it comes. Mind going completely blank. 'Lost all sense of identity - didn't know who I was, found this experience very frightening, I burst into tears.' Normally happy not to see much of my boyfriend. Now want to be with him all the time, missing him. Not normal for me. Decided to separate from partner in last two days. Feelings? - relief and fear. I imagined everything I said was wrong - that I had offended someone - that I had committed some sort of faux pas - that I was gabbling.' In the middle of the night on the ferry felt fear as the boat encountered rough weather, imagined it sinking and felt a great fear of death (more than normal). At the weekend I kept missing people, not connecting. Felt people were picking on me, felt isolated. Missing girlfriend, feel lonely. Fear of authority, adults, schooling. Feelings of powerlessness, sensitivity, vulnerability, failure. Anxious and disconnected. Yearning for I know not what - love, fun, peace! Suspicious, Persecuted Its a very closed sensation as if I've been closed out. A feeling of being shut out as if the door - like a rebound, very powerful at the time, almost as if someone has hit me there but obviously it is not a physical blow, it is very much on the energy level. Felt that people were plotting against me. Woke at 12.30, felt frightened, felt someone following me (on going to loo). Felt very strong fear of heights when visiting the cliffs. Lay down and looked over the edge, even while lying down felt great terror (much more than usual) and a mistrust of people behind me, as if they might push me over the edge. (Unusual). Oversensitive really. Things are going wrong. Normally I take them in my stride. Been pathetic. What's the matter with me? Suspicious. Nobody loves me. Not normally like this. I was bitten on the arm by a cat, bites usually go very septic on me so I dabbed hypercal straight on it. Felt lied to, angry, frustrated. I had the feeling of being picked on. I got really close to people as if I could see them really clearly, and I wanted to meet them in the group. And the feeling I had was that no one would come to meet me and I felt very closed and unhappy. I felt this frustration that no one was coming to play and I could see N in the corner and he just wasn't available, so that all I had for me was to go in the kitchen and just play. So I did. But ever since then felt this other side got picked on. I felt that everyone was watching me and really isolated. And I think 'persecuted' is too strong, but everyone was getting at me. And lots of people came to me and said 'well, look, sorry for offending you'. Feelings of Paranoia. 'Felt that a door was slammed shut in my chest.' 'Felt like I was being lied to.' 'Felt every one was talking about me in an unkind way.' Suspicious. Mistrustful. Felt people did not like me. With people but had feeling they did not like me. Sitting there and not wanting to be sociable. Feeling they don't like me. Not like me at all. Thought people might think I'm a bit strange. In the morning thought I'd committed some faux pas. - Unusual for me. Feeling a bit lacking in self confidence. Feeling like people are looking at me and saying 'she's no good'. Felt picked on. Very easily offended. Everyone is watching me, flush very easily. Feel vulnerable. Desire to be on my own but can't do it. I want people but I don't want the limelight. One person said aggressively 'Have you got a problem'. I started shaking. Had this idea that my hay-fever is about being under attack, worse when I am not taken seriously. It is about me not identifying correctly external changes in the environment; only having one set of responses to this type of situation. I have to expel it violently, physical, mental, emotional. At work they had forgotten my birthday. No card, present or even a verbal message. Felt upset but said it didn't matter. It annoyed me because I am the one who organizes the others' cards and presents. They did not think or care. Didn't mind no card but it's the fact that they didn't care. Violent, Desire to kill I wanted to kill everyone. Dream themes of the AIDS nosode Buildings, Opulence, Stairs A Georgian terrace on a high pavement and I had a smaller apartment within this large house, but I remember there were lots of weird things going on with drug dealers, threats and violence and I had big, strong male friends and I took them up there to protect me but the drug dealers had gone. The house had a top layer which I left derelict so that nobody would suspect that on the basement level I had a beautiful house, so half of it was derelict and half of it was really beautiful downstairs. I don't usually remember dreams and it was distinctive. Dreamt of a house with banisters and lots of stairs. Walking upstairs in House of Commons through enormous rooms, grand, ornate decor - out of another time. Large rooms, wooden panels. Very big and airy. Felt good. Nobody there. Dreams about a big, old neglected house, which he recognized as a house belonging to an old school friend. In his dream this house had a secret staircase, from where he could spy on everyone. He was spying on his sister who had an important meeting. The meeting was about a mortgage, which she deserved to get. There were other, unknown children watching with him, and it felt as if they had a common secret bond. There was great excitement and anticipation about whether his sister would get this deal. The stairs were very large in the house in my dream. A huge, huge mansion house in the middle of a park where you drive up to it. I was buying a smaller flat within this huge house. Big palatial house, used to be very grand, now very ramshackle and being restored by new owners. Striking pictures in the house, modern prints, very, very large - very ornate with large frames, colours stunning and very rich. Woke feeling as if I had eaten a very nice meal. A house by a station. Lots of people about. The station was built on top of a roof. It was in a very rundown state. There was a hill leading up to it and a rough fence all around it. made of wooden paling held together with wire, I think they call it sheep fencing. I met a very scruffy chap and I said to him, 'Where are you living now?' I was some sort of authority figure, a teacher perhaps. He said, 'I live underneath'. We went down to his place. It looked derelict outside, rundown, and I thought, 'nobody could live inside'. But inside it was like a palace. There was a huge hall and lots of lovely antique furniture. It was beautiful. I asked him, 'How much do you pay rent for this?' It seems he was allowed to live there by the owner. In the house was a very nice piano - just the right size for our house. I asked him if he thought the owner would sell it. He said he doubted it. He lifted the top of the piano and inside it was a bit like an old radiogram, but it was a CD player. As I looked at it, it shrank and became a wooden cased CD player - modern machinery. I went to a house with the possibility of buying it. It was on the corner in an industrial estate with lots of scrap metal around, but it was only an ordinary house behind a very high wooden fence around it and there were no views because it was contained inside the fence. The house was like a Tardis because it was much larger inside. There was space in the hall and the staircase and the landings were wide and the view from the lounge was of pretty gardens and the view from the upstairs rooms was a view of the rolling fields. It was in need of renovation, it was empty but it was tatty and it needed to be redecorated. My family were with me and there was a very contented feeling as if I was home. It was the difference between the little outside and the big inside that was strange. The outside of a Georgian house with big square windows but they had a metal frame which is very unusual for sash windows. The dream was in Bath stone creamy colour. There was this car, and there were lots of us in it and there was everyone that I knew, mostly my Hong Kong friends, and we all had our arms around each other and there was a lovely feeling of love, warmth and companionship, there were so many people in this one car, the top was open, the car was red, and we were driving along and we went to this house. There were lots of boxes in this house and very big rooms, but everything was decorated beautifully. There were chandeliers, beautiful furniture, beautiful paintings, antique carpets and there were railings and you just looked down and there was a great feeling of space. Underneath the house it looked as if there was something to do with mechanics. There were all these pipes and things like the mechanics for a swimming pool and I had a feeling of being shut out because there were these two girls who were friends that were organizing to do something and they didn't include me. This feeling of being shut out was the only negative thing, everything else was very positive and lovely. House dream - Large shared house between whole bunch of people. Very rambling. Had to choose a room for myself. I wanted one close to staircase and living room. The first one had no windows. A kid on the bed. Drawers full of Barbie dolls. Didn't like it because it had no window. Going down a corridor - exactly like the inside of a passenger liner - old and plush type, lovely. Went back to the stairs, going too far from where I wanted to go. Had to shut my eyes and follow a thread of warmth that led straight ahead into a huge room with lots of windows all down the side. Lovely, light, wonderful. Still felt like a ship but overlooked trees and hills. It was a stately home type of place. Kids bouncing on the bed. I said 'Is this your room', 'No we are just playing'. So I thought: 'right this is my room.' The room in my dream was big, in fact I couldn't see the walls clearly because they were all misty. In a catholic church, very rich gold paintings, colours, statues. I had a dream about a bit of childhood stuff. It was quite a vivid dream. It was travelling with people in a car, and when we got there I realized it was my parents' house. A lot of money had been spent on it in a garish way and I didn't like it. It had been sold to a family of Pakistanis. I could see through the window that about 30 of them were sitting around our dining room table, eating and I didn't like it. The house was very ornate and I didn't like it. I dreamt that I had bought a block of flats and my brother was painting one of the apartments and I asked him before he went whether he wanted a sandwich and he didn't. We went all the way upstairs and he decided he wanted a sandwich and I was really cheesed off and had to go all the way down. He joined me and we slid all the way down on the banister. It was as if all the block of flats were taken up with stairs and there was nothing else there. It was huge, all stairs. There were no shops that sold sandwiches for miles and miles. Treasure, Crystals It was a dream in which I didn't appear at all. And that's very unusual for me. It was as if I was watching a film, a story, and it was about a boy and his father... it might not have been his real father. They were in a Dickensian-like squalid hotel. The hotel room was very bare and not very nice. The father showed the boy a diary that his unknown mother had kept, and all of a sudden I became the boy. For a moment I couldn't understand the diary, it was in a sort of code but it was very significant. It was about my origins and my parentage. Then suddenly I was watching again. The father gave the boy some magical gifts from the mother and these were very special significant things. The first thing was a sword in a jewelled holder and they hid it under the bed so that no one else would see because it was a special magic sword. Then there were magic blue boxing gloves with which the boy could knock anyone out. There was also a bejewelled broach - and that was significant but I didn't know why. Then there was a magic golden key which could unlock or lock any door, Immediately it came in handy because suddenly the boy realized there was a madman outside the door with a knife. It was as if the boy could see through the door. The madman was standing at the door with the knife raised, and so the boy quickly locked the door so that he couldn't come in. The boy and the father realized that people would want to kill him and take his magic gifts, and that they had better leave. There was a feeling of pursuit and of people following - people out to kill... but interestingly, there was not any fear at all. It was exciting. It was a large house and I had been living in it, but I wanted to move. Everything was made of wood. I had already shifted most of my belongings. There were a few boxes. Three people arrived, two women and a man. They had two huge wooden crates and were looking suspiciously around for somewhere to put them. I started talking to them, and told them that there was space in the house. They brought in these crates and opened them up. The crates had false centres that were packed full of treasure. There was gold dripping out and jewels and crowns. They were full of treasures and I was really excited - but I was moving out. I walked to the patio where there was my box which was full of old junk. The only things that I could recognize were some juggling balls. The treasure was shown to me earlier in the dream - a medieval knight with a thick gold, very old, very beautiful wedding ring, that is just a part... there is more to be found. I am mining in a desert country for rock crystals. I find only amethysts, which is a nuisance because I am looking for diamonds. Dream of being trapped inside an amethyst crystal, but it's not unpleasant. Childhood Back in house with Mum and stepfather, which they bought when I was 14 years old. Never had a dream in that house before, unusual. In my dream my parents are moving house - I say : This time I want the room at the top not my old room (as a child I always wanted the room at the top of the house - I loved the eaves and it was by my parents room: but more importantly it was not next door to my brother's room - it would have been an escape from the place where he (and a gang of friends) had abused me). But my parents say 'It's okay'. I have a new room of my own this time and they show it to me. It is very large with lots of unexpected rooms coming off it - a bathroom, a study, etc.. These will need changing (the bathroom is yellow and the study has plush red seats - both I dislike and both we had at home when I was a child) but there is great potential for this new room. The main room has shelves full of clutter but I can see that amongst it are treasures - it just needs clearing and sorting. But best of all this room has a garden inside it - with a tree - again it needs attention but there is room for flowers, etc.. In my dream I am trying to paint the room - I have chosen dark colours - green/blue - this is unusual, I usually paint my rooms light colours. But after much work I see that there is all this old stuff under where I've painted - old wallpaper, cardboard, etc., it will all have to come off if I'm to do a really good job. My wonderful room leads out to the garden which is a mass of dark brown earth. My father says I have only this one day to dig for the treasure because tomorrow he has arranged to have it planted up and laid over. I realize I have 'wasted' all the day with the painting and that now it is dark and I will need someone to hold a lantern for me so that I can dig. It's going to be harder work because it's night but I have a shed full of tools behind me and I do have someone to help me. I was organizing the renting of this peaceful old house and I had to choose people who I was going to live with. There were several old school friends that I hadn't thought about at all since I was nine/ten years old. Children Dream of children. He was a therapist and had as a patient a girl who wouldn't tell him her symptoms. Her father was trying to speak on her behalf, which she didn't like. He did continue to speak with the father, who said the underlying cause was 'always thinking he had forgotten to say something important'. Horrible dream; I had a baby (great) but after it was born it got smaller and smaller until it was only an inch big, then it disappeared. My mother was in the background giving unsolicited advice to all and sundry about babies. I was heartbroken, then woke up. Woke at 11 a.m. feeling unrested. Dream of having to look after a group of children. Playing touch rugby against parents - instead of ball have set of tea cups on silver tray, so I am running around with tea cups in my hand instead of a ball. In one of my dreams this morning, I was in charge of a roller coaster, and responsible for providing space for all the people who wanted a ride. I didn't have enough harnesses to hold them all in and there was this small child and a baby and I had to rig up harnesses for them. I remember watching them coming down and thinking that the harnesses didn't look very safe. I think the baby got its legs chopped off, but I don't know - I couldn't find out. I was at a function of some sort and the headmistress (who was also a Nun) of my children's school was stood over a collection box, watching just how much was being put in by everybody. The feeling reminded me of my own childhood memories of Nuns at school (fear, retribution, vindictive). I knew I had to put a contribution into the basket but I had no money with me. I feigned putting some money into the basket. It was a deep basket that stood under a table, but even so she still managed to watch what everyone was contributing. I managed to get away with it. Many dreams dimly remembered - had to look after lots of children, large group of people holding hands. I had a dream that I was in this department store all night and I had to make sure that the whole gang of children that were with me weren't pinching things and touching things. Animals I was at work in a vet's practice, not the one where I am now. Some people were the same and some were not. I was sacked from my job for no good reason. Then the vet advised me to have my older cat put down. Before I could discuss it she did it. I was distraught. Crying hysterically and woke crying. I felt as if my life was out of control. Feelings of anger, frustration, very upset. I was in a vet hospital. Lots of cats kept escaping and I and others were trying to catch them. The dream felt very anxious. (I often dream of cats, it is not unusual for me.) Dreamt of a large green fish which had learnt to live on land. It came to see me to discuss the problems in this sort of life for a fish, but there were too many journalists, and it had to go away again. Dreamt of a dog speaking to me about his problems. Had a dreadful dream about a snake. I was being pressured to do heavy psychotherapy with a man I didn't like - a trainer. I thought the whole thing was dangerous, but went in because lots of people were doing it. A small boy of 8-10 was there. He stuck his tongue out at me, it turned into the most disgusting, slithery snake, pink and revolting, which went for my throat, It wrapped itself around my neck. I can't describe the repulsion I felt, nor the fear at being controlled. I said I repudiated it. The therapist in the dream said its not about sex, this snake, it's about the evil within which must be cleansed. I woke up shouting 'I refuse to accept this snake!' but the feeling stayed. Fear; I had to put the light on - revulsion, horror. Had a horrible dream: there were some zoo animals on the loose, lions, wolves etc. We decide to take our primary school children among them in the park having found they were quite tame if you treated them sternly, like a dog. I had to find a place to get some earrings, and a local man with a truck was taking me there. But he took me down a ramp to a car park underground, with the truck's lights off and no lighting in the car park. I knew he was going to rape me and that the car lights were off to show that he knew where he was going, he was in charge, he had all the power. I was a helpless victim, pleading with him not to do it (and at the same time wishing that I did have the opportunity to have sex with someone I love). I felt I couldn't escape, but meanwhile there was another one of me upstairs, who knew where I was and what was wrong. Upstairs I was organizing a wolf to track me and the man down and SORT HIM OUT! Then I woke up feeling very tired and worn out. Dreamt I was in a car accident which ran over my dog, but when I got home he was alive, but a different colour and had a horrible septic state all over his paws and legs, which had taken the fur off, leaving raw flesh. My mum had given him antibiotics, which upset me more than his condition! Dreamt I came across a nearly dead otter - lots of wounds - covered in blood. Went to get water to bathe it - when came back it was gone - worried that it would come to more harm. A man came up and said he had moved the otter into the shade. Dream about flies. Lots of fly's eggs mixed in with white rice in the boot of a car. I knew they would hatch out and he was waiting for it to happen. Sense of fear of the swarm of flies. Nearby there was a honeycomb and I knew the flies were going to go to that when they hatched out. Dreamt of Iguanas. A whole long and complicated dream where the only unifying thing was the constant appearance of iguanas. At the beginning of the dream I was delighted and pleased to see such rare and beautiful wildlife, but they became just a nuisance. When I woke up to write this down I just put 'Bloody Iguanas!' and went back to sleep. I must have been really pissed off at them being in the way. Dream of a circular tall hole in the side of my tent and it was definitely a wolf that had done it, although I didn't see it doing it. I encounter a deadly toad which normally bites and kills, but it bites me and I only get a rash, much to the amazement of those around me. Dream that a giant black dog, six feet long, four feet tall, a man-eater, was on the loose and after us, especially me. Had to climb a fence out of his reach and cling on for dear life as he jumped up to get me, snapping and snarling, catching my hand. Woke with fear of death clutching at my stomach. Teeth & Hair Dreamt my bottom teeth came out, and I put them back the wrong way. Teeth dreams. I am in a seminar with a group of strangers. Somebody tells me that my hair has turned white on the back of my head, which I hadn't noticed before. I seemed to dream for hours about drying my hair. (Which is odd because I don't dry it, I just let it dry). Restless anxious dreams about car tax, teeth and evening classes. I dreamt of a party, it's my party and lose my (false) teeth. Then the party starts to turn really sour, with people being nasty and thoughtless. It gets worse and worse until the dream is a nightmare. Cleaning, Dirt, Infection I dream that I am looking for a toilet as I need to poo. But everywhere I go there is either a very dirty toilet, or one with no lock, or one with people in the cubicles. When I woke up I thought that I must actually need to go to the toilet, so strong was the urge in the dream, but I didn't. Strong dreams that an old neighbour and I had a huge row while I was supposed to be cleaning his house, about the way I was working. I got very angry and tore him off several strips, feeling very strong about my right to be me and live my life as I wished. I was supposed to be going somewhere to meet some people to run some kind of training, and I had to be there by 6 o'clock, but on the way I found all these boxes of tampons and I was thinking 'wow, that's really nice, they are unbleached ones'. But then I thought they might be infected because they were out on the street. I dreamt of the hospital where I work. I am washing the corridors, and am really content to be in such a mindless job... no responsibilities. Shopping, Money A big grey blocks of flats - a friend was living there. The dream moved to a very Indian setting, and I was going into clothes shops. Dream of shopping in a supermarket - I keep putting things into my basket and then back onto the shelves. He had a colour printer for his computer, it had no ink. He tried to fill it up with ink and he accidentally dropped the whole tin of ink inside the rollers. To his surprise the printer worked very well after this and he started to print paper money. Dream; I was in this open supermarket - in Sainsburys, and they were growing wheat-grass and all kinds of sprouts, and I remember thinking oh, that's really cheap, I'll go and really have a healthy diet. Dream of seeing an old friend and being disturbed that he is so poor. I give him \u00a330 as it is all I have. Travel, Boats, Trains, Planes, Buses Dream of an old friend who is piloting a plane in the fog, she does it via instructions on the radio. A crowd of girls and had a cat in a basket. It was in an airport and we were getting anxious as we couldn't find out any information on our flight. It turned out that we did not have one and were stranded. We were all in a state of shock and did not know what to do. Dreamt of children's steam trains - stopping to let people go across the level crossing - manual opening and closing of gates. Dream - that my desk is bigger and constitutes all I need to get by on. I use it as a plane and fly off to a desert setting where I meet Omar Sharif, he calls me a son of a camel, and I can't work out if this is a compliment or not. I was in a car and there were lots and lots of people in this car and I was driving so I was the only person who had any space. There was a red tricycle, a very vivid shiny bright red that suddenly appeared and I hadn't brought anything to lock it up with. I'd obviously forgotten I'd brought the car to put it in and I was thinking what was I going to do with this bike. We'd gone on this bus ride and I'd just found somebody who would look after it for me and I went outside and it had gone! It had been stolen. All through the dream there were lots of people that I was supposed to be with. I wasn't with them because I was doing some other mystery thing and I couldn't connect with them. Right at the end of the dream it had got dark and quite foreboding and I was trying to find the rest of the group and they had gone off without me. I was checking all these buses and eventually I found the group. My little boy was with them and it was such a relief to see him there. Dreamt of flying. I was in the New Zealand mountains soaring and playing above the snow, swooping - very white. Sky was very blue. I was playing, being reckless and it was such an amazing feeling. I was on a hang glider, one hand, being reckless - but such a feeling, incredible. Dreamt a storm had torn all the boats from their moorings and we had to rescue them. Trees were felled by the wind and a trunk had fallen across the hatch entrance to my new boyfriend's boat so he couldn't get out. Dreams of being in outer space. Dreams to do with trains and buses. All busy with lots of people around. He was on a ship, then he was in a rowing boat down by the side of the ship, trying to fish something out of the water with a net. Waiting at ornate railway station, amazing stonework. All over the front are children clambering, misbehaving, yelling, screaming, throwing balls etc. Have to get connection for a flight, train is late. Have to get train to airport - frustrated, going to miss my connection. In a cinema with my best friend. Very busy, lots of people about. They were all rushing down some steps. Friend and I got to a bus stop. We found that the fare was \u00a34.80 for a short journey, which was extortionate, so we argued with the driver and refused to pay. I said 'We'll walk', as it was a short distance. Suddenly we were on a tandem bicycle with a bit on the back like a rickshaw. My mum and dad were in the back. We were struggling to pedal up a steep hill and steps. Mum and dad wanted to put a sofa on the back as well, it was impossible! Then I woke up. Vivid dreams I can't remember. Something to do with boats untied but not moving, bodies of people being organized, me being sought after or in authority. Walking on a disused railway line which ran to a park where I live. Exotic Places Film crew from BBC wanting to film in small town called Wallship. It is on the same latitude as Alaska. I was part of film crew. Needed to find cafe/bar to do film. Went to sea front. Saw wooden boat stocked up like a bar. This was perfect. Young couple about to go broke because of tax debts. Had to convince them we could pay more money than they had ever dreamt of. A perfect situation - for them and for us. Like fortune had smiled on them. Dream; A foreign landscape with unpleasant juxtapositions of images. I was interviewing a family about their Fatherland being made into an independent country. Dreamt of a pyramid in the Egyptian desert, which is a range of vivid colours: blue, green, gold and purple, but I can't find the way into it. Music, Drumming It was just like a vision of me being in my body looking at the rooms in this house. The thing that was noticeable about the house was the wood. There was wood everywhere, and floaty white lace. In one room, I think it was the nursery, there was a white lace carpet on the floor. There were West African drummers in some part of that house. I was making music with three people. I was playing the guitar, an instrument I usually feel uncomfortable with. They were playing a piece, consisting of three parts. The first part, consisting mainly of chords, I managed to play easily, it went fine. The second part did not go so well. I had to play solo, from sheet music, and I usually find this difficult. Then I put my guitar on the ground and played it with my left hand. Not at all logical, but it went fine. I could find exactly the right notes with my left hand. I had a dream about a party in a log cabin in the middle of a wood and somebody came in with what looked like an African drum, and he was playing a rhythm on it, an eight piece rhythm - and he said that JS taught him and that everybody had to learn it. There were three kind of punky looking guys doing handstands in a row outside the front of the log cabin. The house that I was organising the renting of had lots of music in it. A modern room, big room, and very beautiful. I was playing bass guitar, impromptu and pretty badly. There are three old guys talking about the music they have made, like old blues musicians. One of the records they talk about is Harvest, and they play a few tunes off that album. I think this is weird because that's one of Neil Young's albums. Performing, Crowds I was in a large stadium with thousands and thousands of people and I was responsible for laying it out the for the queen. The Queen was to address the crowd but the carpet was late in arriving. I was feeling really comfortable in the stadium with thousands of people. Eventually the carpet was rolled out and I said something to the Queen - a little greeting that I felt a normal person would have responded to favourably. Dream: huge theatre full of people. Half remembered dream - I was rehearsing a play with some other people. It was a dress rehearsal, so we were all on stage in front of an audience. My scene involved me talking to an old school friend (someone I haven't seen since I was thirteen). I also had to bounce up and down on a trampoline, I bounced off it by accident and landed on the floor, quite elegantly but people started laughing and I wondered if they thought I was funny or stupid. I felt I wasn't a very good actress. Dreamt last night that I had to perform a comedy routine, dressed up like a famous person. I decided to wear my long blond wig and be Daryl Hannah. I had to perform in front of a large audience, on a stage and improvise it all. Dreamt twice that he was in charge of a large meeting which was very chaotic, but he was able to bring order into it. Having dreams which are very busy. Situations not quite remembered but lots of people in them. Have been having lots of dreams about groups of people, but don't fully remember them on waking. Sexual Affairs, Ex-boy/girlfriends, Erotic Felt very sexually aroused by image of young male child. In House of Commons and met a man there, he kissed me. Then he started flirting with all the women M.P.'s. I was laughing with him about it. We were in some kind of lunch queue. He was playing one off against another. Dream of three men with whom I have some kind of intimate relationship. Dreamt of an old girlfriend who was trying to persuade me to go back to her and to leave my present one. I was miserable that I had to say no because I knew that she would never understand why I would want to go out with someone she would view as dull. When I woke up I was quite unhappy at this dream. I guess because it could still so easily be(come) true. Dreamt I was about to embark on an affair with a married, middle aged businessman, just for the sex. We didn't do it though because the night passed in carousing with friends. Funny dream; I dreamt it was some sort of female hormone that I was proving. Sounded like colostrum! A whole group of us were in a communal dormitory place with loads of beds. I was sharing a bed with my boyfriend and two other women, one of them started playing with his penis and I saw it, but did not react, neither did he, then she got out of bed and went off. I then helped the other woman find her own bed, most of the beds were taken and we had to go around and around the place before finding a free one. She was upset and I was comforting her. Dream - house-sitting for young couple. The man is good looking and seems attracted to me. Both the couple are intellectual and played the flute. I dream of an old girlfriend and of my current one. The current one asks me to throw ping-pong balls at her, so I do as she bids. This gives her great pleasure and she laughs and laughs. I dreamt I was making love. Dream: was with an old boyfriend in a fast food shop. He and I were naked standing in the queue, it was only slightly embarrassing. Dreamt that a friend told me a mutual ex-boyfriend had all along been having sex and therefore (sic) we were both at risk from HIV and AIDS. Normally have amorous dreams, haven't had any since the first night of the proving. Dreamt of putting a feather into my vagina, which seems absolutely natural in the dream - like something I have to do regularly, although the purpose isn't clear. Dreamt I had a huge period which flooded wherever I went - beds, clothes, chairs. Tunnels I was going through the city and I went through this big round hole, a tunnel. Then I came through into the room that was full of light, it wasn't like a gradual thing where I could see the light, it just suddenly was bright light. I can see one image from my dream and it's of you and you're not enlarged at all, you're diminished, in fact you're in a niche in a wall and red brick around. I am standing on the lip of large well/tower. It is made from wood and going down deep into the earth. It is like a tunnel or funnel. Looks like the old French tennis courts with the balconies and terraces. In most of my dreams, during the proving, I've been actively involved. I'm almost always an onlooker in my dreams and I had that when I was going down the dark tunnel when I was under the sea, which are all quite sometimes got fearful things for me, I wasn't scared at all. It was matter of fact. I was just going along. Violence, Threatening, Frightening, Fire Dream; a western adventure, and of being buried alive with a pile gelignite. Very vivid. Had a dream. I lived in a huge mansion with lots of beautiful antiques and artefacts. It was stuffed full of them. It looked encrusted. Every surface had beautiful things on. Tables with collections of pretty handbags on. It was chunky, solid furniture, but lovely. Collections of things everywhere. There was a huge marble staircase. I remember thinking 'Oh I do live in a lovely place'. I came home and found my husband had hired a young French girl to do the cleaning. He introduced us and I immediately did not trust her, but my husband said that she had worked well. She was very smiling and sweet. I went to bed but went downstairs again to find that she was in a large drawing room, smoking and talking to her boyfriend, who she had smuggled in. He was a 'biker'. This compounded all my suspicions and feelings about her and I felt she was plotting against us. They were out to cheat us. I eavesdropped on them, they did not see me. I went back to bed. In the morning they had disappeared and the whole house had been stripped of the beautiful antiques. Felt cheated, felt I had lost, and angry at myself that I had not insisted to my husband that she left. We didn't have any food and there were remains of entrails of animals in a corner where we had obviously been eating which was really horrible and everything felt like it was moving in towards us - getting closer and closer and I kind of woke up with this sense of urgency and panic that I had to move fast and that's what woke me up, that feeling of having to get out. Its quite unusual for me to have dreams like that. Dream: she was on a beach where there was a hotel and she was being pursued by a man and a bird of prey, which was his weapon. Sometimes it was just the bird chasing her. Finally, she had to hide in a toilet to escape the bird. Suddenly she was in her old home town, running along the streets still trying to escape. The feeling was scary, anxious, frightening, it was horrible being pursued. Dream; went to a party where the place got smashed up. Someone called Lindie kept telling these thugs that I was a friend, but I wasn't and they were looking pretty mean as if they would start to work on me next. It was a very long dream and rather frightening and very vivid. I remember I woke up after it at about am for a pee and felt moved to put the light on as the residual of fear was still lingering. Dreamt about Pearl Harbour. Feelings of imminent doom and devastation, i.e.. before the Japanese invasion of Singapore. Other people present - black people, and my overall manager! Some people spoke Swahili. I was an onlooker and there was this medieval army with a red hot battering ram attacking a castle. There were three figures of flame, just human figures which burst into flame of red and orange. It was really, really frightening. And as they were doing it, they were chanting something. It immediately made me regain consciousness and I was left with a feeling of fear. But I wasn't involved, I was definitely watching. I had a dream this morning. I dreamt that I was sitting across a wooden table with a homoeopathic colleague who said to me, 'you can't come to South America'. Basically, he was saying 'this is my patch and you can't come to my patch', and I got annoyed with him for his attitude and I banged the table with my fists and I said, 'I am going to go if I want to go and this is definitely a large enough place for lots of people including you and me.' He said, 'But you are not going to go, you are a wimp and a coward'. And I got up and walked out of the room in dudgeon. He had a mate who was going to duff me up, he was going to punch me. I realized as I was walking out of the room that I had the choice, either to stay in the room which was safe because there were people in it but then I'd lose face because I'd decided to go out, or to go out and face the danger that he might follow me and duff me up - and I woke up. I am wanting to die. I feel despair. I'm holding the hand of my partner (like the lovers in the Tarot). We jump in and as we do I lose all feeling and everything becomes slow motion. I am tumbling. As I fall I am smashing my limbs on the walls and roofs in the tunnel. Smashing an arm or leg. I am breaking, but all without feeling. I can see that my partner is already dead, smashed. I am willing myself to die. I want to be impaled or fall across a pole so that my back is broken to end it all. Then I can see the floor coming closer and closer. Tumbling I land on my head and then all is black. I feel nothing through all of this. Then I can hear a voice and feel vaguely something touching my face. Its like I am coming out of anaesthetic. Two voices. I can see M vaguely and he says 'Look at the sepsis on his face'. He is stitching my face and talking to another. I start to howl and howl (but make no noise). I am howling in despair. Then I get to my knees and vomit a piece of flesh. It is red and trembling - not pulsating. I dreamt of a mass murder. Dreadful dreams of fear. Dream of being a policeman and shooting people 'right through the heart'. I woke out of a dream feeling that half of me was still in the dream. It was quite a violent sort of dream - it was in a house which appeared from the front like the house where I was born and grew up, but inside the rooms were much bigger and there were lots of connecting alleyways and corridors and there were children and animals, it was like a community in this house but I was the only adult and there were gunmen surrounding the house and we were in danger and I felt a great sense of responsibility because I had to somehow gather all these animals and children with me and I knew what I had to do, I had to get them out but it was really difficult and felt really unwieldy because I had to get everyone together to get them to safety. Wasn't sure if I was the body or was an observer - body was burning from the feet up to the waist and still was talking and very much alive (don't like fire) - could have been me (think it was) or someone else. Other Dreams I dream of being a top class skier and I get involved in a 'Bond' type movie chase scene. I dream of sitting my final homoeopathy exams and I haven't done enough studying. She was with some college friends in a big room doing yoga, they were doing shared postures. Dream of being in the pub with friends, but the only way we can move about is by walking on the tables and chairs. Dream of offering guests stones and beads to eat. I am trying to get into a hospital where I work with a friend. We are using the fire escape to gain access, but there are a range of people coming down and blocking our way. As it's raining I am a bit pissed off at this and say 'It's like the fucking ark here' and then apologize to the people there who have children. Dreamt that there is a real need to drink more tea. (On waking so thirsty that I had to actually have one.) There is a Tai Chi teacher, teaching people how to walk across a tightrope. There was food in my dream, there was somebody selling sandwiches. A group was out camping in the wilderness and everybody was lying on the ground in sleeping bags and I was given a flashlight. I was running about flashing this flashlight. There was some commotion going on in the tent, an argument, or something. My dreams are very disconnected. Usually I have one dream from beginning to end, very colourful and a nice story. My cousin had a very funny pair of pointy shoes, which I thought were really funny and was saying so, when I realised that he liked them, I had to backtrack and say what I thought their good points were. I am with Ken Livingstone, who is dressed in mourning suit. He is working too hard. Physical Symptoms Sensorium I had a very faint feeling on the top of my head, which I attributed to equally to sitting in the sun which I don't usually do but there was a faint discernible feeling as well as if something was scratching.

By the afternoon kept getting light headed, feeling a bit giddy. I'm sure its due to lack of sleep.

I have had a chalk spot on my left cheek high up near my eye for a few years, and today it has got very red and a little bit sore, it looks as though it is a normal spot. It just disappeared overnight. Rash on face, aggravated by heat (been a very hot day). Worse on chin, both cheeks and either side of neck. It is stinging, red and very dry.

Glands swollen on both sides of my neck. Woke with a dry raw throat. I have developed a really awful sore throat just below the Adam's apple and it is making swallowing difficult, this is a typical precursor to getting a cold.

Great pain for an hour and a half with frequent urination. Since midday passing copious amounts of orange brown urine.

A constant pain which develops in my penis like it was being cut inside with razor blades, the only time I feel comfortable is when I am actually urinating. Still a little tenderness in my penis after urinating, no interest in sex. Spots appear on penis at the end on the left side, a little painful, quite red and a head which discharges sticky white puss if gently squeezed. The spot stays red and painful for 9 days and then a load of white yellow pus is squeezed out, after which it clears up. Sex drive very low, really can't be bothered. Disinterested in sex and do not have my customary morning erection. Female Sexual Organs When my period had begun and I felt so wiped out on the second day. 5.00 p.m. my period began.

This lump was removed surgically after a biopsy, because it was 'pre-cancerous'. Neck and Back Lancinating kidney pains and pains in sacro-lumbar region. Lower back ache, really noticeable today. And the odd thing is that I was lying on my back and normally I don't lie on my back, especially in a tent where it's bloody hard, and normally I lie on my side.
