The 2015 guidelines summarize and offer a discriminating review of much of this new knowledge. Pain management is central to veterinarypractice, alleviating pain, improving patient outcomes, and enhancing both quality of life and the veterinarian-client-patient relationship. The management of pain requires a continuum of care that includes anticipation, early intervention,and evaluation of response on an indiv idual-patient basis. The guidelines include both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic modalities to manage pain; they are evidence-based insofar as possible and otherwise representa consensus of expert opinion. Behavioral changes are currently the principal indicator of pain and its course ofimprovement or progression, and the basis for recently validated pain scores. A team-oriented approach, including theowner, is essential for maximizing the recognition, prevention, and treatment of pain in animals. Postsurgical pain is eminently predictable but a strong body of evidence exists supporting strategies to mitigate adaptive as well as maladaptive forms. Degenerative joint disease is one of the most significant and under-diagnosed diseases of cats anddogs. Degenerative joint disease is ubiquitous, found in pets of all ages, and inevitably progresses over time; evidence-based strategies for management are established in dogs, and emerging in cats. These guidelines support veterinariansin incorporating pain management into practice, improving patient care. (J Am Anim Hosp Assoc 2015; 51:67-84.

Q2015 by American Animal Hospital Association JAAHA.ORG 67Introduction Pain management is central to veterinary practice, not adjunctive. Alleviating pain is not only a professional obligation (recall theveterinarians pledge to ''the relief of animal pain and suffering '') but also a key contributor to successful case outcomes and enhancement of the veterinarian-client-patient relationship. Acommitment to pain management identifies a practice as one thatis committed to compassionate care; optimum recovery fromillness, injury, or surgery; and enhanced quality of life. These guidelines continue the trend in all branches of medicine toward evidence-based consensus statements that addresskey issues in clinical practice. Although not a review article, thiscompilation is a force multiplier for the busy practitioner, consolidating in a single place current recommendations and insights from experts in pain management. These guidelines are theproduct of a collaborative effort by the American Animal HospitalAssociation (AAHA) and the American Association of FelinePractitioners (AAFP). The recommendations of the guidelines TaskForce are evidence based insofar as possible and otherwiserepresent a consensus of expert opinion. These guidelines are designed to expand on the information contained in the 2007 AAHA/AAFP Pain Management Guidelines for Dogs and Cats . 1,2The 2015 guidelines differ from the earlier version in several ways. The first sections are general concepts designed to''set the stage ''for the remaining, more specific content. The 2015 guidelines also discuss the importance of an integrated approach tomanaging pain that does not rely strictly on analgesic drugs. Becausepain assessment in animals has become more scientifically groundedin recent years, various clinically validated instruments for scoring pain in both dogs and cats are described. The extensive list of published references includes numerous studies published within thepast 3 yr, reflecting the rapid pace of advances in managing pain forcompanion animals. The 2015 guidelines summarize and offer adiscriminating review of much of this new knowledge. Types of Pain All types of tissue injury can be generators of pain. Occasionally,pain may occur in the absence of such causative factors.Understanding the mechanisms of pain is the key to its successfulprevention and treatment. The pain response is unique to eachindividual and involves two components: (1) the sensory component is nociception, which is the neural processing ofnoxious stimuli and (2) the affective component is pain perception, which is the unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with either actual or potential tissue damage. Pain isthe endpoint of nociceptive input and can only occur in aconscious animal; however, there is also involvement of autonomic pathways and deeper centers of the brain involved with emotion and memory. Hence pain is a multi-dimensional experience; it isnot just what you feel but also how it makes you feel. 3 Acute pain has been defined as pain that exists during the expected time of inflammation and healing after injury (up to 3mo), and chronic pain is defined as that which exists beyond the expected duration associated with acute pain. Therapy should be focused on the underlying cause of pain, (nociceptive, inflamma-tory, or pathological) rather than on arbitrary labels based on duration. 4 Nociceptive pain occurs when peripheral neural receptors are activated by noxious stimuli (e.g., surgical incisions, trauma, heat, or cold). Inflammatory pain results gradually from activation of the immune system in response to injury or infection, and pathologicalpain, also called maladaptive pain, occurs when pain is amplified and sustained by molecular, cellular, and microanatomic changes, collectively termed peripheral and central hypersensitization.Pathological pain is characterized by hyperalgesia (exaggerated response to noxious stimulus), allodynia (painful response to nonnoxious stimuli, such as touch or pressure), expansion of thepainful field beyond its original boundaries, and pain protracted beyond the expected time of inflammation and healing. Under some conditions, genomic, phenotypic changes occur that create the condition known as neuropathic pain, whereby pain can be considered a disease of the central nervous system. Those changesare not necessarily chronologic. Maladaptive pain, or the risk for it, can occur within a matter of minutes of certain acute pain conditions (e.g., nerve injury, severe tissue trauma, or presence ofpre-existing inflammation). A Continuum of Care Appropriate pain management requires a continuum of care based on a well-thought-out plan that includes anticipation, early intervention, and evaluation of response on an individual-patient basis. It should be noted that response to therapy is a legitimate pain assessment tool. Continuous management is required forchronically painful conditions, and for acute conditions until pain is resolved. The acronym PLATTER has been devised to describe the continuum of care loop for managing pain ( Figure 1 ). The components of the PLATTER algorithm for pain management are PLan,Anticipate, TreaT,Evaluate, and Return. It's Not Just About Drugs Classic veterinary medical education places a strong emphasis on treatment of disease through pharmacology and surgery, the 68 JAAHA | 51:2 Mar/Apr 2015esoteric skills that are the domain of the trained clinician. Increasingly, evidence-based data and empirical experience justifya strong role for nonpharmacologic modalities for pain manage-ment. A number of those should be considered mainstreamoptions and an integral part of a balanced, individualizedtreatment plan. Examples of nonpharmacologic treatments supported by strong evidence include, but are not limited to, cold compression,weight optimization, and therapeutic exercise. Other treatmentoptions gaining increasing acceptance include acupuncture,physical rehabilitation, myofascial trigger point therapy, therapeu-tic laser, and other modalities, which are discussed in theseguidelines. In addition, nonpharmacologic adjunctive treatmentincludes an appreciation of improved nursing care, gentle handling,caregiver involvement, improved home environment, and hospicecare. Those methods have the critical advantages of increased caregiver-clinician interaction and a strengthening of the human- pet bond. That shared responsibility promotes a team approachand leads to a more complete and rational basis for painmanagement decisions. 5Recognition and Assessment of Pain The Patient 's Behavior is the Key Because animals are nonverbal and cannot self-report the presence of pain, the burden of pain assumption, recognition, and assessment lies with veterinary professionals. It is now accepted that the most accurate method for evaluating pain in animals is not by physiological parameters but by observations of behavior. Pain assessment, should be a routine component of every physical examination, and a pain score is considered the ''fourth vital sign, '' after temperature, pulse, and respiration.1,2,6Obtaining a thorough patient history from the owner can help determine abnormal behavior patterns that may be pain related. Pet owners should be educated in observing any problematic behavioral changes in their pet and to contact their veterinarian in such cases. As shown in Figure 2 , pet owners and practitioners should have an awareness of behavior types that are relevant to pain assessment. Those include the animal 's ability to maintain normal behavior, loss of normal behavior, and development of new behaviors that emerge either as an adaption to pain or a response to pain relief. Because behavioral signs of pain are either often overlooked or mistaken for other problems, the healthcare team must be vigilant in recognizing those anomalies in the total patient assessment. Pain Scoring Tools Although there is currently no gold standard for assessing pain indogs and cats, the guidelines Task Force strongly recommends utilizing pain-scoring tools both for acute and chronic pain. It should be noted that those tools have varying degrees of validation, acute and chronic pain scales are not interchangeable, and canine and feline scales are not interchangeable. The use of pain scoring tools can decrease subjectivity and bias by observers, resulting in more effective pain management, which ultimately leads to better patient care. Acute Pain: Characteristics and Causes Acute pain involves both nociceptive and inflammatory compo-nents and can be caused by trauma, surgery, and medicalFIGURE 1 The PLATTER Approach to Pain Management The PLATTER method provides individualized pain management for any patient and is devised not on a static basis but according to a continuous cycle of plan-treat-evaluate based on the patient 's response. The PLATTER approach involves the following: PLan: Every case should start with a patient-specific pain assessment and treatment plan. Anticipate: The patient 's pain management needs should be anticipated whenever possible so that preventive analgesia can either be provided or, in the case of preexisting pain, so that it can be treated as soon as possible. TreatT: Appropriate treatment should be provided that is commensurate with the type, severity, and duration of pain that is expected. Evaluate: The efficacy and appropriateness of treatment should be evaluated, in many cases, using either a client questionnaire or an in-clinic scoring system. Return: It can be argued that this is the most important step. This action takes us back to the patient where the treatment is either modified or discontinued based on an evaluation of the patient 's response.FIGURE 2 Behavioral Keys to Pain Assessment When assessing an animal for pain, the following behavioralkeys should be considered: /C15Maintenance of normal behaviors. /C15Loss of normal behaviors. /C15Development of new behaviors. JAAHA.ORG 69Pain Management Guidelines for Dogs and Catsconditions or diseases. These guidelines will focus on recognition, prevention, and treatment of postsurgical pain. Multifactorial Clinical Measurement Instruments (CMIs) for Acute, Postsurgical Pain For dogs, a validated, widely used, multifactorial CMI for acute pain is the Glasgow short form composite measure pain score. The4AVet is another composite measure pain score for dogs, reportedly with more interobserver variability than the Glasgow short form but less biased by sedation. 7,8Simple, online, practice- friendly numerical rating scales (0 to 4) for acute canine and felinepain have been developed (but not yet validated) by Colorado StateUniversity. In cats, a currently validated assessment tool is theUNESP-Botucatu multidimensional composite pain scale. 9,10That scale and video examples of how it is applied in clinical practice canbe downloaded online, and a description of Colorado State 's acute pain scales are included in Table 1 . A Practical Approach to Postoperative Pain Assessment Validated CMIs are the foundation of rational pain assessment. Those assessment tools provid e a simplified approach that encourages regular use by all healthcare members and are basedon the following features: /C15Observing the patient without interaction (i.e., the patient 's orientation in the cage, posture, movement, facial expression,activity level, and attitude). /C15Observing the patient while interacting with a caregiver (e.g.,what occurs when the cage door is opened or an animal iscoaxed to move)./C15Observing the patient 's response to palpation of the surgical site. /C15Assigning a numerical score using a dynamic interactive visualanalog scale (e.g., from a 0 for no pain to a 10 for the worstpossible pain for that procedure). The re-evaluation interval will depend on the procedure, expected duration of the chosen intervention, and previous painscore. Variability by different observers can be minimized byhaving the same team member assess the patient throughout theevaluation period. Ideally, the individual patient 's normal temper- ament should be known for purposes of comparison withpostsurgical appearance and behavior. Chronic Pain: Characteristics and Causes Chronic pain is usually described as either pain that persists beyondthe normal healing time or pain that persists in conditions wherehealing has not or will not occur. In some cases, pain signalingpersists in the absence of gross tissue pathology. The followingbasic principles are relevant to chronic pain in companion animals: /C15Pet owners may not appreciate their pet 's behavior as an indicator of chronic pain; however, what they might see is increasingly diminished function and mobility that indicate progressive disability. Examples include: *Diminished exercise tolerance and general activity *Difficulty standing, walking, taking stairs, jumping, orgetting up *Decreased grooming (cats especially) *Changes in either urination or defecation habits /C15Under-recognized and undermanaged chronic pain can resultin premature euthanasia. 11Conversely, proper recognitionTABLE 1 Acute Postoperative Pain Scales Resource Internet Address Content Colorado State University Canine Acute Pain Scalehttp://www.csuanimalcancercenter.org/assets/files/csu_acute_ pain_scale_canine.pdf/C15Psychological and behavioral indicators of pain /C15Response to palpation Colorado State University Feline Acute Pain Scalehttp://csuanimalcancercenter.org/assets/files/csu_acute_ pain_scale_feline.pdfSame as above University of Glasgow Short Form Composite Pain Scorehttp://www.newmetrica.com/cmps/ /C15Clinical decision-making tool for dogs in acute pain /C15Indicator of analgesic requirement /C15Includes 30 descriptors and 6 behavioral indicators of pain UNESP-Botucatu Multidimensional Composite Pain Scalehttp://www.animalpain.com.br/en-us/avaliacao-da-dor- em-gatos.php/C15Assesses postoperative pain in cats /C15Includes 10 indicators of pain ranked numerically 70 JAAHA | 51:2 Mar/Apr 2015and management of chronic pain can be as life preserving as any other medical treatment in veterinary medicine. /C15Degenerative joint disease (DJD) is the inclusive terminology that includes osteoarthritis (OA). Although DJD and OA areoften used interchangeably in the literature and in practice, the broader term, DJD, will be used throughout these guidelines. Multifactorial Clinical Measurement Instruments for Chronic Pain Observation or reports (e.g., in a pre-examination questionnaire) of behavioral changes or abnormalities is the first consideration inrecognizing and assessing pain. Thereafter, several standardized,multifactorial CMIs for chronic pain are available to veterinarians as summarized in Table 2 . Such CMIs are chronic pain indices that primarily utilize pet owner observations and input. Ideally, patientswith chronic pain should be evaluated with one of themultifactorial CMIs. Pharmacological Intervention of Pain Effective pain management generally involves a balanced ormultimodal strategy using several classes of pain-modifying medications. The rationale behind this approach is that it addresses targeting multiple sites in pain pathways, potentially allowing lowerdoses of each drug and minimizing the potential for side effectsassociated with any single drug. The choice of medication should be based on anticipated pain levels and individual patient needs. Anticipatory analgesia provided prior to pain onset is moreeffective than analgesia provided once pain has occurred,contributing to both a dose- and anesthetic-sparing effect. Opioids Opioids are the most effective drug class for managing acute painand can play a role in managing chronic pain. An improvedunderstanding of neuropharmacology and the development of novel formulations of opioids makes it incumbent on veterinarians to remain familiar with their modes of action; various subtypeswithin this drug class; and the prevention, recognition, andtreatment of adverse effects. While a complete discussion of opioids is beyond the scope of these guidelines, the Task Force makes the following recommendations for using this class of drugs in dogsand cats: /C15Opioids should be used as a routine preoperative preferentially in combination with a tranquilizer/sedative (e.g., diazepam, or a-2 adrenergic agonist such as dexmedetomidine) when the patient 's condition warrants their use./C15Fulllagonists elicit greater and more predictable analgesia than partial lagonists or jagonists. In dogs, the lantagonist/ jagonist butorphanol in particular appears to have limited somatic analgesia and very short duration of visceral analgesia.12,13 /C15In a comparison study, buprenorphine administered before surgery and during wound closure provided adequate analgesia for 6 hr following ovariohysterectomy in cats, whereas butorphanol did not.14 /C15In cats, the subcutaneous route of opioid administration is not recommended. IM and IV routes are preferred both pre- and postoperatively.15The oral transmucosal or buccal route of administration for buprenorphine may also have clinicalefficacy as well. 16,17 /C15The individual effect of any opioid, including duration, mayvary widely from patient to p atient. Postoperative re- evaluation should be made frequently to determine ongoing opioid requirements. /C15For a patient undergoing major surgery, whereby ongoing opioid administration can be anticipated, the clinician may choose from the following strategies: *Periodic readministration of parenteral opioids. *Constant or variable rate infusion. Calculators can be foundonline. *Long-acting formulations and technologies. For dogs there is an FDA- approved transdermal fentanyl producta. Given this canine fentanyl product on the market, the Task Force discourages the use of human commercial fentanyl patchesin dogs due to highly variable pharmacokinetics, risk of either accidental or purposeful human exposure, with potential liability for extralabel use. There is not an expertconsensus regarding the utility of fentanyl patches in cats.The FDA has more recently approved a concentrated injectable buprenorphine product for cats b, which has been formulated to provide a 24 hr duration of action whenadministered as directed.TABLE 2 Multifactorial Clinical Measurement Instruments (CMIs) for Chronic Pain Assessment in Veterinary Medicine Helsinki Chronic Pain Index (HCPI) Canine Brief Pain Inventory (CBPI)Cincinnati Orthopedic Disability Index (CODI)Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL)Liverpool Dogs (LOAD)Feline Musculoskeletal Pain Index (FMPI) JAAHA.ORG 71Pain Management Guidelines for Dogs and Cats*Oral opioids. Dogs exhibit a robust first-pass effect of oral opioids. No clinical studies document efficacy, butpharmacokinetics of codeine and hydrocodone suggestpossible utility. 18No comparable studies for cats. /C15Opioids are synergistic with a-2 adrenergic agonists, allowing them to be used in low-dose combinations, either with orwithout ketamine, to great effect for both sedation andanalgesia. /C15Opioids play a significant role in human medicine for thetreatment of chronic pain and may play an underappreciatedrole in dogs and cats as well, especially for cancer-related painand in palliative care patients. That said, clinicians must bevigilant with regard to long-term adverse effects such as constipation, drug tolerance, and the potential for diversion by clients. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs The majority of conditions that cause pain have an inflammatorycomponent. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are amainstay for management of chronic pain as well as for perioperative use. NSAIDs should be used for their central and peripheral effects in both dogs and cats after consideration of riskfactors. There is no indication that any one of the veterinary-approved NSAIDs are associated with any greater or lesser incidence or prevalence of adverse events (AEs). 19Canine and feline veterinary-approved NSAIDs have demonstrated acceptablesafety profiles, which in nonapproved NSAIDs such asaspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and 20-22 Long-term use of low-dose meloxicam is approved in cats in many countries other than the US. AEs related to NSAID use in dogs and cats can be minimized by appropriate use as outlined in Figure 3 . Although the overall incidence and prevalence of NSAID-related toxicity is unknown, itdoes appear to be very low relative to the number of doses administered. 20 Of the AEs associated with NSAIDs, gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity is the most common. The GI clinical signs associated withNSAID toxicity in dogs include vomiting, diarrhea, and inappe- tence. 20,23-25In cats, inappetence appears to be the most common AE. Although unlikely, it is possible for erosions and ulcers to besilent and occur prior to any clinical signs. 23,26Studies indicate that NSAIDS that spare cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 produce a lowerfrequency of GI lesions, although the more highly COX-2-selective inhibitors may actually produce more AEs when underlying gastric damage is already present. 19,27The leading risk factors for NSAID-associated GI perforations are incorrect dosing, concurrent use with other NSAIDs or corticosteroids, and continued use despite GI signs or anorexia.20,24 Signs of GI toxicity usually emerge within 2-4 wk but can occur atany at any point during administration. 28,29It is critical that veterinarians communicate NSAID toxicity risk factors to pet owners (e.g., providing client information that describes potentialside effects, including the commercial circulars provided by drugmanufacturers and instruction on when to stop medication andcontact a veterinarian). This Task Force strongly encourages implementation of practice systems that ensure communication to clients of appropriate AEs and risk information for anyprescribed drug, including NSAIDs. Another important side effect associated with NSAIDs is nephrotoxicity. When administered before anesthesia in healthy dogs with controlled modest hypotension, no adverse effect onrenal function was detected. 30,31However, because some dogs in those studies did develop changes in renal parameters, the importance of maintaining a normotensive state during anesthesia is considered paramount when utilizing preoperative NSAIDs.Preoperative administration in dogs is superior in efficacy topostoperative use, consistent with results of multiple studies performed in humans. 32Similar studies have not been conducted in cats undergoing anesthesia, but one feline study revealed noalteration in glomerular filtration rate measured by iohexolclearance after 5 days of oral meloxicam. 27If IV access is not possible and normotension cannot be achieved with certainty, the Task Force recommends limiting the use of NSAIDs to postsurgical administration. Idiosyncratic hepatocellular necrosis has been reported with various NSAIDs but remains exceedingly rare, only 1.4 cases/10, 000 dogs (0.052%), usually occurring between 2 and 4 wk after starting treatment. Preexisting elevated liver enzymes are not a riskfactor. 19Idiosyncratic hepatocellular necrosis is not a true toxicosis but rather an intrinsic, heritable reaction to the molecule being administered.20 Highly COX-2-selective NSAIDs have caused delayed bone healing in rabbit and rodent models, and one study in dogsdemonstrated delayed healing of experimental tibial osteotomies following long-term NSAID use. 33The latter study may not be a clinically relevant model, and another study reported that normaltissue healing is rapidly restored once the NSAID is withdrawn. 34 Further, of 299 dogs receiving deracoxib, carprofen, and firocoxib in the FDA-approval process, none were reported to have delayed fracture healing or nonunion fractures. Finally, no clinicallysignificant bleeding dyscrasias have been reported with the use ofveterinary NSAIDs. 20 72 JAAHA | 51:2 Mar/Apr 2015Local Anesthetics (LAs) This is the only class of drug that renders complete analgesia. The totality of evidence in humans and animal studies reveal the predictable analgesic and anesthetic drug-sparing effects of LAs. Inaddition, LAs are reported to be antimicrobial, immunomodulat- ing, and can diminish postoperative maladaptive pain states. They do not appear to delay tissue healing. 35LAs can be administered either directly at a simple incision site or at a specific nerve to provide analgesia to a large region (or area). A discussion of themany locoregional blocks that can be utilized in dogs and cats is beyond the scope of these guidelines but can be found in several readily accessible resources, and most of those blocks can be readily learned by clinicians. LAs are considered safe, with AEs generally limited to very high doses or inadvertent IV administration(bupivacaine especially). The Task Force supports the InternationalVeterinary Academy of Pain Management position that, because of their safety and significant benefit, LAs should be utilized, insofaras possible, with every surgical procedure. a-2 Adrenergic Agonists a-2 Adrenergic receptors are located with opioid receptors. Thus, the two drug classes used together are highly synergistic for sedation and analgesia. a-2 Agonists have a versatile dosing profile. That allows low and even micro doses in combination with opioidsto be clinically useful and minimizes the cardiovascular effects. Clinicians should be mindful that cardiovascular side effects occur even with very low doses of a-2 adrenergic agonists, that lower doses will have a shorter duration of effect, and that analgesic effects have a shorter duration than the sedative effects.FIGURE 3 Nine Ways to Minimize the Risks of Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) 1. Obtain a complete medication history. Avoid or use extreme caution with concurrent or recent use of NSAIDs and/or corticosteroids (including some nutritional supplements that may contain aspirin or other cyclooxygenase-inhibiting mechanisms). Practitioners shouldobserve the following additional precautions due to potential drug interactions: /C15Avoid with furosemide and use caution with angiotensin-converting with potentially nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides, cisplatin). /C15Caution with use of additional highly protein-bound drugs (e.g., phenobarbital, digoxin, cyclosporine, cefovecin, chemotherapyagents). 2. Be discriminating in patient selection. Be cautious or avoid NSAIDs in patients with the following existing/anticipated conditions: /C15Low-flow states such as dehydration, hypovolemia, congestive heart failure, and hypotension. In such cases, IV fluid support and bloodpressure monitoring should be available for anesthetized animals. /C15Renal, cardiac, or hepatic dysfunction. 3. Provide verbal and written client instructions to avoid the medications described in point 1 above and to discontinue and alert the hospital at the first sign of an adverse event (see point 4). 4. Recognize the earliest signs of adverse events and withdraw NSAID treatment immediately if those events occur, especially in case of any gastrointestinal sign in dogs and cats with diminished appetites. 5. Perform laboratory monitoring. The frequency will depend on the risk factor of the patient. /C15Ideally within first month of initiating therapy then q6 mo thereafter in low-risk patients. /C15For at-risk patients, monitor q2-4 mo depending on risk-factor assessment. 6. Utilize a balanced, integrated analgesic approach as part of NSAID-sparing strategies.7. Consider washout periods. Clinically relevant washout periods remain controversial and largely undefined. Based on pharmacokinetics, practitioners who wish to err on the side of caution may want to withhold meloxicam for 5 days and other NSAIDs or short-actingcorticosteroids for 7 days prior to initiating treatment with another NSAID. In the case of long-acting corticosteroids, a longer washoutperiod needs to be considered. Aspirin should not be administered because there are safer alternatives. If a course of treatment withaspirin has been started in a dog, the recommended washout period before starting an approved veterinary NSAID is up to 10 days. 8. Use gastroprotectants to either treat suspected gastropathy or prevent its occurrence, especially if no washout period occurs. Proton pump inhibitors, H 2antagonists, misoprostol (the drug of choice in humans), and sucralfate can be helpful. 9. Dose optimization. Base dosage on lean body weight. Although there is no definitive evidence that NSAID dose reduction lowers the risk of adverse events, some clinicians recommend titrating to the lowest effective dose. JAAHA.ORG 73Pain Management Guidelines for Dogs and CatsKetamine Ketamine exerts pain-modify ing antagonist a ctions. Subanesthetic ketamine constant rate infusion (CRI) in humans prevents pain and hasantihyperalgesic, and antiallodynic effects. 36,37Studies appear to support a similar clinical effect in dogs, although ketamine 's analgesic effect has not yet been studied in a feline surgical model.38-40The International Veterinary Academy of Pain Management has adopted a position that the pain-modifyingeffects and safety profile of subanesthetic doses of ketaminewarrant its use as part of a multimodal approach to trans-operative pain management, especially in patients with riskfactors that may predispose them to either exaggerated ormaladaptive pain states. Systemic Lidocaine There is strong evidence of the safety and beneficial effects of IVlidocaine on pain after abdominal surgery (although not for othersurgeries eliciting somatic pain) in humans and possibly in horses,including both analgesia and return of bowel function. 41IV lidocaine is anesthetic-sparing in dogs and cats, but currentevidence for a pain-modifying effect in those species remainsinconclusive. 42Some investigators discourage the use of IV lidocaine in cats due to negative cardiovascular effects, butsuccessful use in clinical practice has been anecdotally reported. 43 Various formulations for a combination of morphine, lidocaine,and ketamine CRIs have been described in dogs. 44 Tramadol In contrast to humans, tramadol in dogs has a very short half-life(1.7 hr) and negligible amounts of the opioid M1 metabolite areproduced. 45-48Pharmacodynamic studies parenteral tramadol in dogs.49-53Convincing evidence for a pain-modifying effect of oral tramadol, however, remains elusive, and already low plasma levelsquickly diminish with sequential administration. 54-57One small study of oral tramadol did report a statistically significant increaseof mechanical threshold levels in dogs, but only at the 5 and 6 hrtime points. 48 In contrast to dogs, cats do produce the l-agonist M1 metabolite. A pain-modifying effect has been demonstrated inboth a thermal threshold and clinical surgical model. 58,59One case series involving the use of oral tramadol in a flavored compoundedform (the drug is otherwise quite bitter), and dose-titration,toxicity, and safety data are currently lacking in both dogs andcats. 60Gabapentin Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant with analgesic properties that maybe primarily derived by down-regulating calcium channels. 61 Because of its efficacy and tolerability, gabapentin is widely usedin humans with neuropathic and other maladaptive painconditions. 62Along with published clinical case reports in animals, the data suggest a strong rationale for using gabapentin in dogs andcats with similar conditions. 63,64One canine study suggested a disease-modifying effect in experimental DJD, but clinical studiesare lacking. 65In cats, one unpublished study demonstrated a benefit of gabapentin in naturally-occurring DJD (E. Troncy,personal communication 2013), and one case series of chronicmusculoskeletal pain has also been published. 66 The evidence for gabapentin in human postsurgical pain is encouraging, but not yet in dogs and cats.67-72An 8-12 hr dosing interval has been suggested based on one publication.73The primary adverse effect in dogs appears to be somnolence (also thecase in humans), which usually resolves with patient acclimationover several days, allowing for a tapering-up schedule. Amantadine Amantadine exerts a pain-modifying effect as an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and remains a drug of interest forchronic pain (but not specifically for DJD) in humans. 74One study demonstrated utility as an adjunct to NSAIDs in dogs withrefractory DJD, and there is one case report utilizing amantadine totreat neuropathic pain in a dog. 75,76Toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in humans and cats but not indogs. 77,78 Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) As a class, TCAs are the most effective medications for selectiveneuropathic pain conditions in humans. 79In dogs, there exists only a single case report where amitriptyline was used for neuropathicmusculoskeletal pain. 80 Selective Serotonin (Norepinephrine) Reuptake Inhibitors [SS(N)RIs] These compounds exert their effect by increasing serotonin with or without norepinephrine in the synaptic cleft. At least one SS(N)RI,duloxetine, has a chronic pain label indication in humans. In dogs,bioavailability is poor and clinical efficacy is lacking. 81 At this point in the manuscript, the Task Force wants to emphasize that many drugs and compounds enhance eithermonoamines or serotonin expression. Caution should be usedwhen such analgesic agents are used in combination. Examples 74 JAAHA | 51:2 Mar/Apr dogs, several earlystudies revealed a pain-modifying effect in orthopedic surgery, andpharmacokinetic data has been reported. 82-84The literature does not appear to indicate that acetaminophen has a proclivity towardshepatotoxicity in dogs. Maropitant Maropitantcis a central antiemetic indicated for the treatment of acute canine and feline vomiting, which is often a postsurgical sequela and a contributor to the pain burden. Maropitant works through a blockade of substance-P binding to the neurokinin-1receptor, which is involved in pain processing. The true pain-modifying effect of maropitant in dogs remains uncertain despite canine studies revealing an anesthetic-sparing effect and a noninferior effect to morphine in an ovariohysterectomy mod-el. 85,86 Bisphosphonates Administered by IV infusion, this class of drug exerts antiosteoclastactivity and can contribute to pain relief in dogs with bonecancer. 87 Corticosteroids Corticosteroids are not primarily analgesic drugs, but may exert apain-modifying effect by reducing inflammation. Their utility as ananalgesic therapy in dogs and cats has not been reported. 88-91 Polysulfated Glycosaminoglycans (PSGAGs) A parenterally administered PSGAG productdhas regulatory approval for the control of signs associated with noninfectious degenerative and/or traumatic arthritis of canine synovial joints. Independent studies support PSGAGs as safe and effectivechondroprotectants with possible disease-modifying effects. 92-94 The bioavailability and distribution of PSGAGs to inflamed joints in cats has been demonstrated with extralabel subcutaneous administration.95 Nutraceuticals and Other Oral Supplements Oral nutritional supplements represent a wide spectrum ofcompounds either as single agents or in combinations. Anecdotalevidence for a pain-modifying effect of those products remainsmixed. If nutraceuticals and/or herbal supplements are made partof a treatment plan, the Task Force suggests mindfulness towards product quality control, potential drug interactions with other medications (e.g., some over-the-counter joint products and herbalmixtures contain aspirin and some may contain herbs such as St John 's Wort that interfere with serotonin release or reuptake), and avoidance of ingredients derived from endangered species. In the future, evidence for the pain-modifying effect of cannabinoids and/ or their commercial drug derivatives may become evident. Non-pharmacologic Modalities for Pain Management Weight Optimization for Pain Management Adipose tissue secretes a mixture of cytokines that circulate throughout the body, contributing to the pathology of manydiseases, including DJD, and to the hypersensitization process in general. Either maintaining or regaining a lean body condition score is central to the treatment of chronic pain. Acupuncture for Pain Control The guidelines Task Force holds that acupuncture offers a compelling and safe method for pain management in veterinary patients and should be strongly considered as a part of multimodalpain management plans. 96It is a minimally invasive treatment that, for most animals, is not uncomfortable, often pleasant, and can be used either alone or in addition to other pain treatment modalities.Acupuncture has been recognized by the National Institutes of Health since 1998 as having applications in human medicine, especially pain management. There is a solid and still-growing body of evidence for the use of acupuncture for the treatment of pain in veterinary medicine to the extent that it is now an acceptedtreatment modality for painful animals. 97-101 Physical Rehabilitation Combined modality therapy to decrease pain and restore function is now considered an essential approach for musculoskeletal injury and post-surgical recovery.102In the treatment of chronic disease, such as DJD or conformational abnormalities, rehabilitation should be considered an important component of an overalllong-term treatment strategy. 103 The foundation of rehabilitation is therapeutic exercise that aims to restore musculoskeletal strength and function, endurance, proprioception, and the reduction of pain. Most commonly it involves exercise and manual therapy, including joint mobiliza-tions, massage, and myofascial release. Energy-based modalities are also often employed, including neuromuscular electrical stimulation, transcutaneous electrical JAAHA.ORG 75Pain Management Guidelines for Dogs and Catsnerve stimulation, cryotherapy with and without compression, therapeutic ultrasound, therap eutic laser, and extracorporeal shockwave therapy.104-108 Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is increasingly recognized as an important comorbidity in many chronic pain cases in animals. MPS is acknowledged for the important role it plays in the pathology of DJD, repetitive strain injuries in performance dogs, oras a sequela to orthopedic surgery. The pathophysiology ofmyofascial pain is a complex syndrome involving motor, sensory, and autonomic nerve components that are beyond the scope of these guidelines but is well described elsewhere. 109The treatment of MPS is often essential to regain full function of the affected limbregardless of the underlying cause. 110 Nutrition Management for Pain Management In the overweight patient, the prime nutritional emphasis shouldbe achieving a leaner body condition. Weight control diets fortifiedwith omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to be effective at reducing signs associated with both canine and feline DJD. 111-114 Thermal Modification In acute injury, including surgical areas, cold compression has ademonstrable benefit in reducing pain, inflammation, and return to function. 115In the case of chronic injury, heat can improve comfort and function through a variety of mechanisms.116 Environmental Modifications There is strong evidence that the stress of hospitalization inhibitsnormal behaviors in animals, including eating, grooming,sleeping, and elimination. 117Fear, anxiety, stress, and distress lead to hyperalgesia in both humans and animals.118-121Strategies to mitigate hyperalgesia therefore include providing bedding,blankets, or clothing from home with familiar scents; allowingvisitation of hospitalized pets; separating the dogs from the cats;placing cages so that animals do n ot see each other; using species- specific synthetic pheromones; and proper handling, especially during procedures. 122-126Detailed information on handling feline patients has been recently published.127,128In patients with DJD, throw rugs and ramps will improve mobility and abilities at home. Chiropractic Care This Task Force has not found sufficient, reliable, noncontradictoryevidence for the use of chiropractic care for pain management in veterinary medicine at this time. That said, chiropractic care hasmany well-defined applications in human medicine that have beensupported through reliable research.Homeopathy Incontrovertible evidence that homeopathy is effective in either human or veterinary medicine for the treatment of pain is lacking. Sole reliance on homeopathy to treat a painful condition is in essence withholding pain treatment. Thus, the guidelines Task Force discourages the use of homeopathy for the treatment of pain. Gentle Handling Techniques The importance of gentle handling of patients with either acute or chronic pain cannot be overstated, especially when working with arthritic dogs and cats. Conscious avoidance of careless handling will ensure the patient 's comfort, allow for a more thorough and effective physical exam, and avoid exacerbating anxiety in the agitated, fearful, or aggressive patient. An important additional benefit of gentle handling is that it demonstrates to the pet owner that healthcare team members are compassionate and aware of the significance of pain in their patients. Managing Surgical Pain This Task Force suggests that pain management for dogs and cats undergoing a surgical procedure include the following: /C15A preoperative opioid plus midine) /C15Administration of an NSAID either pre- or postoperativelybased on patient risk factors and clinician preference /C15AL A For patients undergoing procedures with risk factors for more severe, protracted, or maladaptive postoperative pain states, the following interventions or drugs should strongly considered: with Overview of DJD in Companion Animals DJD, including OA, is one of the most significant and underdiag- nosed diseases of cats and dogs. DJD is clinically relevant because ofits overall prevalence and universal incidence in older animals. Whereas diagnostic approaches for canine DJD are well established, the best tools for diagnosis of feline DJD are still being developed. The pain treatment continuum for DJD starts with the onset of disease, which usually starts at a very young age in dogs (e.g., 76 JAAHA | 51:2 Mar/Apr 2015conformational etiology) and cats (unknown etiology), which persists throughout the animal 's life. Perhaps more so than any other pain condition, the management of DJD benefits from anintegration of both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treat-ments. Once a diagnosis is made, treatment goals, expectations, and outcome measures should be considered prior to initiating any treatment. The caregiver is an essential part of any treatmentprogram and should be considered a part of the team. Canine DJD: Therapeutic Considerations Because early intervention can delay the onset and severity of DJD,this Task Force emphasizes that chief among all preventive andtreatment modalities for canine DJD is weight optimization.Maintaining a lean body condition from an early age demonstrably minimizes DJD development in predisposed breeds. 129-131In overweight patients, weight loss alone, even a modest 6.1-8.85%,improves clinical signs of DJD. 132 There is strong evidence to support the use of NSAIDs for the management of DJD pain in dogs. Data on the safety and efficacy of long-term NSAID administration in dogs appears to suggest anoverall benefit from this modality for a sustained period of time atlabeled doses and intervals provided the patient does not have additional risk factors. 22NSAID therapy should be tailored to suit every individual patient 's needs. Veterinary NSAIDs studied for chronic use (between 28 days and 1 yr) demonstrated satisfactorysafety profiles in dogs, with 95-97% of dogs able to receive their NSAID at labeled doses and intervals without adverse effects for the duration of their study. 22There is currently no evidence that a higher risk for NSAID-induced adverse effects exists as the durationof treatment increases. Some dogs may require several weeks ofNSAID treatment before clinical improvement is noted. 133 In addition to NSAIDs, there are other options to consider. First, PSGAGs are more likely to have a beneficial effect when given earlyin the disease process. 92As mentioned earlier, an FDA-approved product with established efficacy and safety is available. Second, data supporting analgesia and functional improvement from therapeutic exercise is well established in humans and is beginningto accrue in dogs. 134Third, a systematic review analyzing data from several placebo-controlled blinded studies, affirmed the utility of diets rich in eicosapentaenoic acid for dogs with DJD.135Various other strategies can be and often are employed, but currently theirsupporting evidence is weak, conflicting, or altogether lacking atpresent. Feline DJD: Therapeutic Considerations Until the early 2000s, little attention was paid to DJD in cats;however, estimates from published studies suggest that 40-92% ofall cats may have some clinical signs associated with DJD. 136Feline DJD is now recognized as a serious welfare problem, particularly in older cats, which is a rapidly growing demographic.136,137The most frequently affected joints appear to be the hip, stifle, tarsus, elbow,thoracolumbar, and lumbosacral area. 137For each 1 yr increase in a cat 's age, the expected total DJD score increases by an estimated 13.6%. Moreover, there is a dramatic increase in the prevalence and burden of DJD at about 10 yr of age. A diagnosis of feline DJD isbased on a thorough history reflecting changes in behavior andlifestyle, physical exam findings, and possible radiographic evidence. Behavioral changes are the most common signs of DJD- associated pain in cats. Feline DJD is usually bilateral, so althoughcats rarely limp, they are likely to be stiff, have a less fluid gait, become less active (especially at night), and exhibit decreased jumping frequency or jumping height. 138Owners often note that their cats are very stiff going up or down stairs. The cat may resisthandling, petting, or stroking of the back or limbs. Showing the owner a list of the common pain-related behaviors caused by DJD is helpful in making the diagnosis ( Table 3 ). It should be assumed that a senior cat has some DJD, and every effort should be made to incorporate gentle handling techniques and padded surfaces for the cat to lie on during the exam. A positive clinical response to analgesics will also indicate thepresence of DJD. The first validated clinical metrology tool forthe evaluation of feline musculoskeletal pain has now beenproduced and is available for use in practices. 139,140 NSAIDs are the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment for DJD in other species, and there is considerable evidence to support theireffectiveness in cats as well. 141-145In the US, however, NSAIDs are not approved for long-term use in cats, and the potential side effects often deter many clinicians from routinely using them in cats. Renal toxicity is always a consideration in the use of NSAIDs;however, one retrospective study found that long-term use ofmeloxicam did not reduce the lifespan of cats .7 yr of age with pre-existing, stable chronic kidney disease (CKD) compared to cats without CKD. 146 Low-dose meloxicam (i.e., 0.01-0.03 mg/kg per os q24 hr) is effective in treating arthritic cats and is well-tolerated even in cats with CKD provided their clinical status is stable.145Meloxicam is effective when administered once q24 hr and is palatable for most patients, making it easy to administer. In Europe, Australia, andmany countries, meloxicam is approved for long-term use in cats ata dose of 0.05 mg/kg q24 hr. The oral rote of administration and long-term use of meloxicam in cats remain off label in the US. Robenacoxib is a COX-2 selective NSAID approved for surgical pain in cats. It has not been studied for either feline DJD or in older JAAHA.ORG 77Pain Management Guidelines for Dogs and Catscats but there is long-term safety data in young cats (i.e., 5 3the recommended dosage for 6 mo and 10 3the recommended dosage for 6 wk).147,148 Dosing on lean body weight, close monitoring of clinical status (especially appetite), regular laboratory monitoring, and appropri-ately modifying the treatment plan are recommended for cats receiving NSAIDs. 149NSAIDs should be used with caution on a case-by-case basis in cats with DJD, and cat owners should beadvised that in the US, use of NSAIDs for feline DJD is an extra- label indication. Treatment of DJD in cats should focus on environmental modification in addition to pharmacologic therapy. In addition to steps and ramps to facilitate access to favorite elevated areas, additional litter boxes with at least one low side will make accesseasier. Owners can also provide physical therapy by implementing play times using favorite toys to increase exercise and mobility. When Pain Persists: Hospice and Palliative Care Hospice is designed to provide compassionate comfort and care to patients at the end of their lives and to support their families in the bereavement process. Hospice care for terminally ill patients isrecommended when life expectancy is ,6 mo. Palliative care is the active, total care of patients with disease that is not responsive to curative treatment, with pain control being the paramount feature.The goal is achievement of the best quality of life (QOL) for patients and their families. This assumes ongoing assessment of QOL in the terminally ill patient. User-friendly QOL assessmentscales are available to help veterinarians, veterinary staff, and owners make proper assessments and decisions at the end of apatient 's life. 150It is generally agreed that the pet 's caregiver is best suited to evaluate QOL, but a team approach emphasizing regular communication (discussed in the next section of these guidelines)is important to provide empathetic support when end-of-life decisions are made. An integrated approach that includes nonpharmacologic modalities is typically best for palliative-care and hospice patients with cancer because it is often associated with features of bothacute and chronic pain. In cases of palliative radiation, either a smaller number or lower doses of radiation can make treatment protocols more tolerable to the patient and agreeable to the owner.Environmental modification, physical therapy (e.g., massage, acupuncture, and therapeutic laser), or ultrasound can be useful additions to the pain management plan. Providing nutritionalsupport via feeding tube can be helpful where eating is otherwise difficult or painful. In cases involving hospice and palliative care, it is important to encourage clients to have realistic expectations of the outcomes involving their pets. This includes explanations of probable outcomes and providing the cli ent with end-of-life choices involving the pet. Euthanasia is an option that relieves pain and suffering and should be discussed as a reasonable and humane alternative at some point. Euthanasia may be a topic that theveterinary team initiates if the pet owner does not. A Team Approach and Client Education: Creating an Environment for Success Primary care practices should be committed to educating the healthcare team and its clients about prevention, recognition, assessment, and treatment of pain. A team approach and consistentTABLE 3 Signs of Degenerative Joint Disease (DJD) in Cats Behavioral component Indicators of DJD Interaction with others Withdrawal, hiding, increased ''clinginess, ''irritability when touched, aggression toward other cats or humans Sleep and rest Decreases, feigning sleep, restless, trying to find a comfortable position, laying in an unusual position (e.g., not curled up)Appetite Declines but cat continues to eatPosture Hunched, head lowered, sitting or lying abnormally, squinting, facial expression indicating discomfortGrooming Declines, matting of fur, over-grooming of painful areaLitter box use Decline in bowel movements, house soiling, inability to get into box Play Reduced overall, reduced jumping Vocalization Increased but decreased greeting and other pleasant vocalizations, hissing if touched on painful area, squinting if acute painMobility Not jumping as often or as high, hesitant to jump, difficulty going up or down stairs, squinting, stiffness, less active, difficulty getting into or out of litter box, sleeping in more easily accessible locations DJD, degenerative joint disease. 78 JAAHA | 51:2 Mar/Apr 2015pain-management messages directed at clients will help ensure patient comfort at all stages of treatment. The client is often considered the most important member of the healthcare team. Each healthcare team member should be able to recognize pain-associated behavior in animals as described earlier in this document and know how to respond appropriately. Table 4 provides examples of how healthcare team members shouldrespond to patients experiencing pain. Staff Training and Education Ideally, every healthcare team member should have a defined rolein managing animal pain. Staff and client education should addressconditions associated with pain; its prevention and treatment; andappropriate interaction, handling, and nursing care involving the patient. Medical rounds and staff meetings are effective tools in making sure that all staff members are aware of the individualizedpain management needs of every hospitalized patient. Having apatient advocate for each hospitalized animal will enable a highly accurate and individualized evaluation of the patient and ensure successful treatment. Recall that Table 1 lists pain indices relying onobservation and input by clinical personnel. Those assessment toolscomplement the pain-scoring instruments based on ownerobservation and input, which are listed in Table 2. Client Education and Instructions With each pain management plan, it is important that the client begiven specific instructions, both verbally and in writing. Potential adverse drug effects and action to be taken should be emphasized. It is advisable to provide a hands-on demonstration on how toadminister medications and handle the pet at home. 1To reinforce verbal information about pain assessment, provide handouts that discuss general information about animal pain and any side effects of medications. Compliance will improve if the pet ownerunderstands the treatment schedule and a demonstration of howto administer oral medications is given. Clients should beencouraged to address their concerns about the pet 's condition and treatment plan via e-mail, phone, or follow-up consultations. Conclusion Effective pain management is an essential component of compan- ion animal medicine. It reduces disease morbidity, facilitatesrecovery, enhances quality of life, and solidifies the relationshipamong the veterinarian, client, and pet. Behavioral changes are theprincipal indicator of pain and its resolution, for which there are now several validated, clinical scoring instruments. Pain is not an isolated event but instead exists either as a continuum of causation,progression, and resolution or as a chronic condition. Thus,treatment of pain should consist of a continuum of care in the form of anticipatory analgesia through the anticipated pain periodfollowed by longer-term or even chronic treatment that relies onperiodic reassessment of the patient 's response. Effective pain management is integrative in two respects. First, it does not rely solely on pharmacologic methods but also uses avariety of nonpharmacologic modalities. Not least of those is gentlehandling and nursing care of the patient in the context of a stress- free physical environment. When considering either nonpharma- cologic methods or hospice care that may be outside the immediateskills or services provided by the primary practice, the veterinarianTABLE 4 Healthcare Team Member Responsibilities for Pain Management Healthcare team member Pain management responsibilities Veterinarian Assess pain in every patient regardless of appointment type (e.g., wellness, sick, follow up) Develop standard operating procedures for the practice to prevent pain, including the following: /C15Weight optimization and prevention of dental disease /C15Handling and hospitalization to prevent fear and pain /C15PLATTER (see Figure 1) to follow up and modify plan.

A second aspect of integrative pain management is the multimodal use of medicationsthat either block or modify multiple pain pathways. A multimodalapproach also reduces reliance on any single agent, minimizing thepotential for adverse drug events. Pain management in clinical practice is a team effort, with the pet owner functioning as an integral part of the team. All healthcareteam members should have a defined role in the practice 's approach to providing compassionate care to its patients. That enables the practice to speak with one voice and in a consistentmanner in the implementation of pain management protocols. Client education is a key component that enables the pet owner tomanage pain in the home setting. Direct involvement of the clientin pain management efforts is consistent with the continuum ofcare concept and a demonstration of the practice 's commitment to the pet 's QOL. A fully integrated approach to pain management, involving recognition and systematic assessment, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods, and one that includes both healthcare team members and the pet owner, ensures thatTABLE 5 Summary of Appropriate Interventions for Pain in Dogs and Cats Notes: 1) Local or regional analgesia may be useful in localization of pain and short term relief of significant DJD pain. 2) See section concerning the use of NSAIDs in cats. 3) The addition of other analgesic drugs will depend on patient characteristics and extent of the procedure.4) These interventions will be helpful pre- and post-operatively for the relief and/or prevention of post-operative and chronic pain. 5) Ideally premedications should precede other preparations for general anesthesia such as placement of IV catheter. 6) These are invasive procedures and should be treated as such to optimize patient care and minimize trauma/tissue damage and post-procedural pain.7) The level of intervention will be tailored to the invasiveness of the procedure. Deep ear cleaning will require more significant intervention than superficial cleaning in most cases. 8) In non-emergent settings (e.g. routine pre-surgical application). 9) Chemical restraint in lieu of manual restraint when patient fractious, distressed, or otherwise intolerant of procedure.10) Sterile lidocaine lubricant; caution in cases of \u00bcchronic | 51:2 Mar/Apr 2015everything possible has been done to relieve a patient 's pain once it enters the practice 's care.
