The federal regulations identified by the enactment of the PPACA are expected to have various impacts on employee benefit plan designs, costs, and eligibility over the course of the next four years, with the initial impacts occurring for the State Employee and Retiree Health and Welfare Benefits Program participants on July 1, 2011. a NEW! Extension of Young Adult Coverage to Age 26 The PPACA has extended the eligible age limit of children from 25 to 26. A child is defined as an eligible biological, adopted, or step-child for the purposes of PPACA. As a result of health plan changes mandated by PPACA, employees will be allowed to re-enroll dependents who have lost health coverage due to turning age 25. Employees may enroll their adult children during the 2011\u00ad2012 Open Enrollment period. Enrollment elections made during the 2011-2012 Open Enrollment period will be effective on July 1, 2011. The PPACA has required health plans to change eligibility criteria for adult children in the following ways: child does not have to reside in your home; child is not required to be a student; child does not have to be a tax dependent; child may be eligible for coverage under his/her own employer; child may be married or unmarried. PPACA does not require coverage for the child's spouse or children; however, the State of Maryland will continue to cover grandchildren. a NEW! Open Enrollment will run for 30 Consecutive Days with No Correction Period Special Enrollment notice for Coverage of Children Up to Age 26 Individuals whose coverage ended, or who were denied coverage (or were not eligible for coverage), because the availability of dependent coverage of children ended before or upon attainment of age 25 are eligible to enroll in the State Employee and Retiree Health and Welfare Benefits Program. Individuals may request enrollment for such children during the 30 day Open Enrollment period. Enrollment will be effective July 1, 2011. The child may remain covered until the last day of the month in which he or she reaches age 26, provided all other eligibility criteria are met. For more information contact the Employee Benefits Division at 410-767-4775 or 1-800-30-STATE (1-800-307-8283). a NEW! Elimination of Lifetime Maximum on PPO and POS Plans Special Enrollment notice for Individuals Who have Reached Lifetime Limit The lifetime limit on the dollar value of benefits paid under the PPO and POS plans no longer applies. Individuals whose coverage ended by reason of reaching a lifetime limit under the plan(s) are eligible to enroll in the plan. Individuals have the 30 day Open Enrollment period to request enrollment. For more information contact the Employee Benefits Division at 410-767-4775 or 1-800-30-STATE (1-800-307-8283) or at www.dbm.maryland.gov/benefits. 2 s u m m a r y o f g e n e r a l b e n e f i t s j u l y 2 0 1 1 - j u n e 2 0 1 2 108363_dbm-Text_r.indd 3 3/16/11 1:39 PM Maryland State Employees and Retirees 3 a NEW! Primary Care Provider Designation Patient Protection Disclosures CareFirst Point of Service (POS) generally requires the designation of a primary care provider. You have the right to designate any primary care provider who participates in the network and who is available to accept you or your family members. For children, you may designate a pediatrician as the primary care provider. For information on how to select a primary care provider, and for a list of the participating primary care providers, contact CareFirst at 410-581-3601 or 1-800-225-0131 or www.carefirst.com/statemd. You do not need prior authorization from CareFirst or from any other person (including a primary care provider) in order to obtain access to obstetrical or gynecological care from a healthcare professional in the network who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology. The healthcare professional, however, may be required to comply with certain procedures, including obtaining prior authorization for certain services, following a pre-approved treatment plan, or procedures for making referrals. For a list of participating healthcare professionals who specialize in obstetrics or gynecology, contact CareFirst at 410-581-3601 or 1-800-225-0131 or www.carefirst.com/statemd. a NEW! Elimination of Cost-sharing for Preventive Care Services Below are several examples of the types of preventive services requiring no copayment. For the entire list of required preventive care services with no cost share please refer to www.uspreventive servicestaskforce.org/recommendations.htm. In-network well child examination (newborn through 30 months - 12 visits; 3 years through 21 years - one per plan year) covered at 100% of Plan's allowed benefit with no copayment In-network adult physical examination (22 years and older) covered one per plan year at 100% of Plan's allowed benefit with no copayment In-network annual GYN examination at 100% of Plan's allowed benefit with no copayment In-network nutritional counseling and health education for chronic conditions covered at 100% of Plan's allowed benefit with no copayment Annual screening mammograms - Age 35-39 one baseline screening, Age 40+ one per plan year Annual influenza vaccine rendered by in-network provider covered at 100% of allowed benefit a NEW! Elimination of Rescission Provisions The PPACA provides that effective July 1, 2011, your coverage can not be rescinded except - in the case of fraud, or; an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact. The State is required to send a thirty-day advance notice of the rescission prior to the termination of your coverage. a NEW! Appeals Standards Internal claims and appeals process: Please contact your medical provider for more information. Plan contact information is located in the front of this guide or at www.dbm.maryland.gov/benefits. External claims and appeals process: More information regarding the external review process will be forthcoming in a supplemental document which will be available in late April 2011. a NEW! Early Retiree Reinsurance Program You are a plan participant, or are being offered the opportunity to enroll as a plan participant, in an employment-based health plan that is certified for participation in the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program. The Early Retiree Reinsurance Program is a Federal program that was established under the Affordable Care Act. Under the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program, the Federal government reimburses a plan sponsor of an employment-based healthcare reform Maryland State Employees and Retirees 5 108363_dbm-Text.indd 4 3/11/11 8:15 AM - 4 s u m m a r y o f g e n e r a l b e n e f i t s j u l y 2 0 1 1 j u n e 2 0 1 2 health plan for some of the costs of healthcare benefits paid on behalf of, or by, early retirees and certain family members of early retirees participating in the employment-based plan. By law, the program expires on January 1, 2014. Under the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program, your plan sponsor may choose to use any reimbursements it receives from this program to reduce or offset increases in plan participants' premium contributions, co-payments, deductibles, co-insurance, or other out-of-pocket costs. If the plan sponsor chooses to use the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program reimbursements in this way, you, as a plan participant, may experience changes that may be advantageous to you, in your health plan coverage terms and conditions, for so long as the reimbursements under this program are available and this plan sponsor chooses to use the reimbursements for this purpose. A plan sponsor may also use the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program reimbursements to reduce or offset increases in its own costs for maintaining your health benefits coverage, which may increase the likelihood that it will continue to offer health benefits coverage to its retirees and employees and their families. a A Word About Program Requirements The State Employee and Retiree Health and Welfare Benefits Program is subject to many federal and State laws and regulations. Complying with these provisions makes it possible for employees to have pre-tax premium deductions in the Program, to have tax-free State subsidies for Active employee and retiree coverage, and to offer benefits like the Flexible Spending Account plans. Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code has strict regulations and guidelines for administering the Program. As a new employee who is eligible to participate in the State plans, you have 60 days from your hire date to enroll yourself and the eligible dependents you want to cover, and to submit the required documentation. If you do not enroll during this period, you must wait until the annual Open Enrollment period held before the next plan year starts. Once Open Enrollment closes, benefit elections (who is covered, coverage level, and plan) are locked in for the entire plan year. Changes can only be made during Open Enrollment for the next plan year or if you experience a qualified change in status. Qualified status changes include marriage, birth, adoption, divorce, death of a spouse, death of a dependent, moving outside of the health plan network, loss of other coverage, etc. If you experience one of these events and wish to make a change to your benefit elections, you must contact your Agency Benefit Coordinator or the Employee Benefits Division immediately. Your benefit election changes must be consistent with the status change event. For example, if you get married, you may add your spouse to your medical plan. You must make your changes and submit all required documentation within 60 days of the event. Under the regulations, we cannot accept changes received more than 60 days after the event. Please refer to our website for a detailed list of qualified status changes. We must abide by the regulations and cannot allow changes to elections after Open Enrollment closes. Please be sure to make your changes early in the Open Enrollment period to leave time for review and correction of those elections if necessary. 4 s u m m a r y o f g e n e r a l b e n e f i t s j u l y 2 0 1 1 - j u n e 2 0 1 2 108363_dbm-Text.indd 5 3/11/11 8:15 AM Maryland State Employees and Retirees 5 Enrollment Instructions During Open Enrollment, you must use the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system if you want to: a Enroll in a new plan or make changes to your current benefit selections; a Enroll in a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) (for Active/Satellite employees only) - for the first time or to re-enroll.

You may need to change the coverage level (i.e., Employee & Spouse or Employee & Family, etc.) of your plans if you add or delete a dependent. The system will not automatically change your coverage level. Following the close of Open Enrollment, you will be advised of the documentation required to cover your newly enrolled dependents. Failure to provide this documentation by the deadline indicated will result in the removal of the dependent. Any claims submitted for such dependents on or after the termination date will be your responsibility to pay. See pages 15-16 for dependent documentation requirements. If you add an ineligible dependent or fail to remove an ineligible dependent from your coverage, you will be required to pay the employee or retiree premium and full State subsidy for the ineligible dependent for each month that he or she remains enrolled. eNROllmeNT INSTRUCTIONS Maryland State Employees and Retirees 9 108363_dbm-Text_r.indd 8 3/16/11 12:49 PM - 8 s u m m a r y o f g e n e r a l b e n e f i t s j u l y 2 0 1 1 j u n e 2 0 1 2 Benefits Overview Who is Eligible Certain employees and retirees are eligible for coverage. Refer to the charts on the following pages to determine if you are eligible for benefits from the State of Maryland. If you are eligible, you may also cover your eligible dependents for certain benefits. Important Information About Covering Your Same Sex Spouse or Same Sex Domestic Partner and Your Spouse or Partner's Child(ren) a How Your Taxes May Be Affected - Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations require different tax treatment for group insurance costs associated with health benefits for qualified same sex spouses and domestic partners and eligible same sex spouse and domestic partner's dependents for pre-tax coverage or FSA coverage. In most cases, the IRS does not qualify same sex spouse and domestic partners and same sex spouse or domestic partner's dependents for tax-free treatment under the tax code. Therefore, health benefits for same sex spouse/domestic partners and their eligible dependents who are not qualified as a dependent under the IRS tax code will be taxed as outlined below: a Payroll Deduction - For each group health insurance plan where there is an employee contribution and a State subsidy in which you enroll your same sex spouse/domestic partner and your spouse/partner's eligible dependents, you will pay a: Post-tax deduction for the coverage level attributable to the same sex spouse/domestic partner (and/or spouse/domestic partner's child(ren); and Pre-tax deduction for the coverage level applicable to the employee coverage level minus the amount of the post-tax deduction. a Imputed Income - For each group health insurance plan where there is an employee contribution and State subsidy in which you enroll your same sex spouse/domestic partner and/or your same sex spouse/domestic partner's eligible dependents, you are subject to tax withholding on the State's contribution towards the coverage for those dependents not qualified as tax dependents under the IRS code. In other words, the State's contribution towards coverage for your same sex spouse/domestic partner and your same sex spouse/ domestic partner's dependents is considered wages and is included in your taxable gross income subject to tax withholdings. This is known as imputed income.

The child must be younger than the individual claiming him/her as a tax dependent. Your dependent child does not need to be a student or disabled to be covered up to age 26. Disability certification is required to cover children beyond age 26. If the child is 25 or older and not disabled, post-tax deductions and imputed income apply to any grandchildren, legal wards, etc., that you cover under your benefit deductions.

Important - Duplicate Coverage Prohibited A husband and wife or same sex spouse/domestic partner who are both Active State employees and/or retirees may not be enrolled as both an employee/ retiree and as a dependent in the same plans. This is duplicate coverage and is not permitted under the benefit program. This also applies to Satellite agency dependents [including domestic partners and their child(ren)]. Two State employees and/or retirees may not be covered twice under the coverage of two employees/retirees. It is the employee's/retiree's responsibility to make sure that they and their dependents do not have duplicate state coverage. this includes your children who may also be state employees. Duplicate benefits will not be paid. Your Cost The amount you pay for benefits coverage depends on several factors, including: The benefit plans you choose; Whom you choose to cover; Your age (for Life Insurance and Long Term Care Insurance only); Your Medicare eligibility (for retiree medical benefits only); Your status (full-time Active, part-time Active, retiree, ORP retiree, etc.); and Your amount of service with the State (for retirees and ORP retirees only). If you are eligible for the maximum State subsidy, you pay the amount shown on the premium rate document at www.dbm.maryland.gov/benefits. However, some individuals will receive no State subsidy or only a percentage of the State subsidy and will be responsible for the amount shown on the premium rate chart plus the difference between the maximum State subsidy and the percentage for which he or she is eligible to receive, if any. The premiums do not apply to Contractual, Part-time Active (below 50%) employees, Satellite employees, and some State retirees and ORP retirees. Contractual and Part-time employees do not receive any State subsidy of their coverage. Satellite employees receive only the subsidy provided by their Satellite Organization employer.

If you enroll in benefits at a time other than during the Open Enrollment period, refer to the chart below to see when your coverage begins. If you are... Coverage becomes effective... A new Active employee enrolling for the first time Either the 1st or 16th of the month, based on the pay period in which the first deduction is taken. An Active employee making an authorized mid-year change in coverage Either the 1st or 16th of the month, based on the pay period in which the first deduction is taken. (Some employees have only one single monthly deduction.) Newly retired and enrolling for retiree benefits for the first time 1st of the month, based on the month in which the first deduction is taken or when payment is received for direct pay enrollees. A retiree making an authorized mid-year change in coverage 1st of the month, based on the month in which the first deduction is taken from your retirement allowance or when payment is received for direct pay enrollees. You may purchase coverage retroactively to the date you or your dependent(s) became eligible for coverage or back to the date of the change in circumstances permitting a mid-year change in coverage, whichever is earlier, on a post-tax basis but no more than 60 days in arrears. See your Agency Benefits Coordinator or call the Employee Benefits Division for more information. New retirees should receive a retroactive adjustment letter from the Employee Benefits Division regarding any missed premiums between their date of retirement and the period covered by their first retiree premium deduction. You may not retroactively cancel coverage, or retroactively elect to participate, in an FSA.

IRS regulations for cafeteria plans strictly govern when and how benefits election changes can be made. You are only permitted to make changes to your coverage during the Open Enrollment period each year. The coverage you elect during Open Enrollment will be in place July 1 to June 30 of the plan year. However, there are some changes in status that permit you to make limited changes in the middle of the plan year. Examples of qualifying changes in status include: a Birth or adoption/placement for adoption of a child; a Death of a dependent; a Dependent's loss of eligibility; a Marriage or divorce; a Dissolution of a domestic partnership; a You or your dependent child's loss of SCHIP/ Medicaid/Medical Assistance coverage; a You or your dependent gain access to a SCHIP/ Medicaid subsidy based on your residence in another state; a Involuntary loss of other coverage, such as if coverage under your spouse's employment ends; a Gaining eligibility for Medicare (for retirees); or a Changes in your other coverage which has a different plan year. * NOTE: If you are a new State employee, you have 60 days from your date of hire to submit an enrollment form indicating your benefit elections. You have 60 days from the date of the qualifying change in status to submit an enrollment form making changes to your benefits. Any changes submitted after 60 days of the qualifying change in status cannot be accepted, and you will have to wait until the next Open Enrollment period to make the desired change. NOTE: Documentation supporting a qualifying event must be submitted with the State enrollment form. For example, requesting to cancel benefits due to obtaining other coverage requires a letter from the employer or insurance provider on company letterhead. The letter must identify all benefits (i.e. medical, dental, life insurance, etc.) for which the person is enrolled, the names of dependents covered and the effective date of the new coverage. If you decline to enroll yourself or a dependent because of other coverage, you may be able to enroll in the future if you or your dependent(s) lose that other coverage. REMOVIng DEPEnDEnTS WhO LOSE ELIgIBILITy Ex-Spouse You must submit an enrollment form to remove your ex-spouse as soon as you are divorced. The ex-spouse cannot be continued on your State benefits coverage. If you fail to remove your ex-spouse within 60 days of your divorce, you will be required to pay the full insurance premium, including the State subsidy for the period beginning with the date of divorce through the date your ex-spouse is removed from your coverage.

BENEFITS OVERVIEW There are no pre-existing condition limitations for any of the medical plans, but there are other exclusions. Please contact the medical plans for further information on coverage exclusions, limitations, determination of medical necessity, preauthorization requirements, etc. For a list of participating plan providers, please access carrier websites located on the inside cover of this guide.Maryland State Employees and Retirees 21 108363_dbm-Text_r.indd 20 3/16/11 12:51 PM - 20 s u m m a r y o f g e n e r a l b e n e f i t s j u l y 2 0 1 1 j u n e 2 0 1 2 When Coverage Ends You may choose to end your coverage during the Open Enrollment period or as a result of having a qualifying status change allowing you to terminate coverage mid-year. a If you elect to cancel your coverage during the Open Enrollment period, your coverage will end on June 30. a If you end coverage as a result of a qualifying status change, the date your coverage ends will be determined by the time period covered by your last deduction or payment. It is your responsibility to verify your benefit deductions on your check or retirement stub and your Summary Statement of Benefits to make sure they match the coverage you requested. If there is an error or omission in your deductions, you should immediately contact: a Your Agency Benefits Coordinator, if you are an Active, Satellite or Direct Pay employee; or a The Employee Benefits Division, if you are a retiree or a COBRA enrollee. Refunds Special Note for Active Employees Your effective date of coverage depends on the pay period ending date for which the first benefit deduction is taken. The pay period ending date is shown on the check stub of each paycheck. Paychecks are distributed approximately one week after the pay period ending date. If you miss any premium deductions because of an unpaid absence, you must pay all missed premiums or your coverage will be cancelled for the remainder of the plan year. In some cases, you will be required to pay the subsidy portion as well. Missing one or two pay periods is considered a short term leave of absence. Please review the policy in the Continuation of Coverage section. The Employee Benefits Division will bill you for missed premiums and the payment deadline is strictly enforced. If you missed deductions because you transferred between two agencies or have a payroll error, please contact your Agency Benefits Coordinator immediately so that your Coordinator can calculate your share of the premiums and submit a retroactive adjustment form. This must be done so that your benefits continue without interruption for the remainder of the plan year. If your benefits are cancelled, you will be permitted to re-enroll only during the next Open Enrollment period. Refunds will only be considered when an administrative error by a State agency has occurred. Errors by members will not be considered. The member must submit a request within one calendar year of the administrative error, and a refund will only be approved for up to a one-year period. A refund request for any reason other than an administrative error by a State agency cannot be approved. Examples of refund requests that will be denied include: a An incorrect coverage level due to: - Dependent no longer being eligible - Divorce a Incorrect benefits due to errors on your enrollment form. a Incorrect deductions for changes that were not made within 60 days of the qualifying change in status. a If benefits were used during the period in which a refund is being requested, no refund is permitted. 20 s u m m a r y o f g e n e r a l b e n e f i t s j u l y 2 0 1 1 - j u n e 2 0 1 2 108363_dbm-Text.indd 21 3/11/11 8:15 AM Maryland State Employees and Retirees 21 Medical Benefits (includes routine vision and behavioral health coverage) your Choices You have eight medical plans from which to choose: a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) Plans: CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield UnitedHealthcare In general, all options under each type of plan (PPO, POS, or EPO) cover the same services. However, the participating provider networks for the plans are different. Be sure to carefully review what's covered by each type of plan, as well as which providers and facilities participate with the various plan networks. how the Plans Work Once you enroll in a medical plan, you will receive identification cards in the mail. Take these cards with you every time you receive medical services. Depending on what type of medical plan you choose, the way you receive medical services and how much you pay at the time of service will vary. Please review the plans carefully and select the plan that best suits your needs. PPO and POS plans offer out-of-network benefits. EPO plans do not provide out of network benefits except for true emergencies. Please refer to the benefit charts on pages 22-35 for more details on each medical plan option. Allowed Amount The plan's allowed amount refers to the reimbursement amount that the plan has contractually negotiated with network providers to accept as payment in full. Non-participating providers (out-of-network) are not obligated to accept the allowed amount as payment in full and may charge more than the plan's allowed amount. In the charts that follow, if it indicates the service is covered at 80% out-of-network, it means the plan pays 80% of the allowed amount. You are responsible for any amount above the plan's allowed amount when you receive services from non\u00adparticipating providers. STAnDARD BEnEfITS fOR MEDICAL Plans The following charts are a summary of generally available benefits and do not guarantee coverage. To ensure coverage under any plan, contact that plan before obtaining any services or treatment. Call the plan for more information on coverage limitations, exclusions, determinations of medical necessity, and preauthorization requirements. In addition, you will receive a description of coverage book from the plan in which you enroll that will provide details on your plan coverage. If your Provider Terminates from your Plan network Providers may decide to terminate from a plan network at any time. If your provider terminates from your plan, please note it is not considered a qualifying event that would allow you to cancel or change your plan election. You will be able to change your plan election during the next Open Enrollment. nOTE: Outpatient prescription drug benefits are There are no pre-existing condition limitations for any of the medical plans, but there are other exclusions.

DETAILS TO FOLLOW IN SUPPLEMENTAL COMMUNICATION BULLETIN. The State's Prescription Drug Plan is administered by a Pharmacy Benefit Manager called a \"PBM.\" The PBM can provide you with additional plan information, the location of participating pharmacies, the identification of preferred drugs, the cost for your prescriptions, and other plan information. Outpatient prescription drug coverage is not included in any medical plan coverage. You must enroll separately in the prescription drug benefits plan; there is a separate premium for this coverage. If you or your covered dependents are eligible for Medicare, you may have additional options for prescription drug coverage through the Medicare prescription drug plans (Part D) that became available January 1, 2006. Please see the Notice of Creditable Coverage in this guide for more information. NEW! Copays and Out-of-Pocket Maximums for Active Employees Effective July 1, 2011, the prescription plan copays and the annual out of pocket maximums have changed for active employees, other non-retirees and their dependents. Please see the chart on the following page. How the Plan Works BRAND NAME VERSUS GENERIC DRUGS The State prescription plan only covers up to the cost of a generic drug when a generic is available. If you purchase a brand name drug when a generic drug is available, even if it is prescribed by your physician, you must pay the difference in price between the brand name and the generic, plus the applicable copay. The plan does not pass judgment on a physician's determination as to the appropriate medication for treatment, but the plan does have limitations as to the types and amounts of reimbursement available. This same rule applies to prescriptions filled either at a retail pharmacy or through the mail order program. PBM contact information to follow. Preferred Brand Name Drugs Preferred brand name drugs are those medications that the PBM has on its preferred drug list. This list may change at any time. The PBM's physicians and pharmacists evaluate the medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Each drug is reviewed for safety, side effects, efficacy (how well the drug works), ease of dosage, and cost. The drugs that are judged the best overall are selected as preferred brand name drugs. You pay less if you choose preferred brand name drugs. Preferred drugs are reviewed quarterly and are subject to change. 40 s u m m a r y o f g e n e r a l b e n e f i t s j u l y 2 0 1 1 - j u n e 2 0 1 2 108363_dbm-Text_r.indd 41 3/16/11 12:54 PM Maryland State Employees and Retirees 41 ACTIVE EMPLOYEES ONLY \u2014 NEW! SAME COPAYS FOR RETAIL PhARMACIES OR ThROugh ThE VOLuNTARY MAIL ORdER PROgRAM When you have a prescription filled, your copay is based on the type of drug you purchase and the quantity. As shown in the chart below, you will pay less if you fill your prescription with a generic or preferred brand name drug. NOTE: If you choose a brand name drug when a generic is available, you will pay the generic copay plus the difference in cost between the generic and brand name drug. The PBM also offers a voluntary mail order program that enables you to have long-term or maintenance medications (for conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes) delivered to your home. You may refill your medications online or by phone. Type of drug Prescriptions for 1-45 days (1 copay) Prescriptions for 46-90 days (2 copays) Generic drug $10 $20 Preferred brand drug $25 $50 Non-preferred brand name drug $40 $80 The Prescription Drug plan has an annual out-of-pocket copay maximum of $1,000 per individual and $1,500 per family. This means that when the total amount of copays you pay during the plan year reaches $1,000 or the total amount of copays combined for you and your covered dependents pay during the plan year reaches $1,500, you and your covered dependents will not pay any more copays for eligible prescriptions for the remainder of the plan year (through June 30). If you choose to purchase a brand name drug when a generic drug is available, the amount of the generic copay will be counted toward your $1,000 or $1,500 annual copay maximum, but the amount you pay that is the cost difference between the generic and brand name drugs will not. Special Note for Retired Employees Please note that a proposal has been made to change the retiree drug plan benefits as follows: Prescription coverage will closely mirror the basic Medicare Part D plan: Retiree pays first $310 in Rx costs each year. After $310 annual deductible is met, retiree pays 25% of prescription costs and Plan pays 75%, up to $4,550 in retiree out of pocket costs. After maximum retiree out of pocket cost reached, Plan pays 100% for remainder of the plan year. This proposal may be passed as is, amended and passed, or not passed at all. If this proposal is passed, these benefits are effective July 1, 2011. If the proposal is amended, the plan design in the chart to the left will change and you will be sent a supplemental communication detailing the changes. This information will also be posted on the Employee Benefits Division website. If the proposal is not passed at all, Retirees will have the same new prescription copays and out of pocket limits as Active employees outlined in this section.

The first step in the process is usually a treatment known to be safe and effective for most people, called first-line therapy. The next step is second-line therapy. First- and second-line drugs are selected by the PBM after careful review of medical literature, manufacturer product information, and consultation with medical professionals. Example: The prescription drug Celebrex is a mandatory step therapy drug for those under age 60. Before first-time coverage for Celebrex is provided, you may need to try other first- and second-line medications. Your physician will need to submit medical documentation to the PBM's Prior Authorization Unit for Celebrex to be covered for first-time treatment. Details on Step Therapy to follow. Leukotriene Modifier Step Therapy Program Leukotriene Modifiers (Singulair, Accolate and Zyflo) are medications used to treat asthma and generally should not be taken as first-line therapy for asthma or allergic rhinitis (allergy).

A Flexible Spending Account (FSA) is an account that allows you to set aside pre-tax dollars to pay for qualified healthcare or dependent day care expenses. You choose how much money you want to contribute to an FSA at the beginning of each plan year and can access these funds throughout the year. All FSA contributions are pre-tax, which means you save money by not paying taxes on the amounts you set aside to pay for eligible healthcare and dependent care expenses. There are hundreds of eligible expenses for your FSA funds, including prescriptions, doctor office copays, health insurance deductibles and coinsurance for you, your spouse or eligible dependents. Claims for Same Sex Spouses/Domestic partners and the dependent child(ren) of same sex spouses/domestic partners are not eligible for FSA (reimbursements of claims or services for them) unless they are your tax dependents as defined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). NOTE: As of January 1, 2011, under healthcare reform, over the counter medications are no longer eligible for reimbursement under your healthcare FSA without a prescription. Insulin is still eligible for reimbursement. This plan is intended not to discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees as to eligibility to participate, contribution and benefits in accordance with applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The Plan Administrator must take such actions as excluding certain highly compensated individuals from participation in the plan or limiting the contributions made with respect to certain highly compensated participants if, in the Plan Administrator's judgment, such actions serve to assure that the plans does not violate applicable nondiscrimination rules. Plan Features a Payment (Debit) Card If you were enrolled in the healthcare FSA plan for the 2010-2011 plan year and received a payment card, and are re-enrolling for the 2011-2012 plan year PLEASE CONTINUE TO USE YOUR CURRENT CARD. If this is your first time enrolling in a healthcare FSA, you will receive a payment card, sometimes called an FSA debit card, to quickly and easily access healthcare FSA funds. Since there is no Personal Identification Number (PIN) associated with the card, you use it like you would a credit card, and funds are deducted directly from your account. In many cases, card transactions are automatically approved. However, you may be required to submit itemized receipts for some transactions. Be sure to always keep all documentation of your payments. a Online Claims Submission If you do not use your payment card, you have the option to quickly and easily create a secure claim online. Once you submit your receipts, ConnectYourCare will send your reimbursement within a few days. There is no minimum amount for reimbursement. a 24/7 Customer Service If you have a question, the ConnectYourCare dedicated customer service center is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The customer service center number is toll-free 866-971-4646. 52 s u m m a r y o f g e n e r a l b e n e f i t s j u l y 2 0 1 1 - j u n e 2 0 1 2 108363_dbm-Text_r.indd 53 3/16/11 12:58 PM Maryland State Employees and Retirees 53 Your Choices There are two types of FSAs available: a Healthcare Account: You may contribute between $120 and $3,000 a year to reimburse yourself for eligible out-of-pocket healthcare expenses, including deductibles, copays or coinsurance not reimbursed by any medical, dental, vision or prescription plans for you, your spouse or your tax dependents. Healthcare FSa Minimum Maximum Annually $120.00 $3,000.00 12 pay period deductions $10.00 $250.00 24 pay period deductions $5.00 $125.00 20 or 21 Pay Faculty (19*) Scheduled deduction $6.00 $150.00 * 20 or 21 pay faculty members must contact the Personnel Office of their respective institution to determine their pay schedule for the multiple deduction pay periods. Multiple deduction schedules differ by institution. a Dependent Care Account: You may contribute between $120 and $5,000 a year, or up to $2,500 a year if married and filing separately, to reimburse yourself for eligible dependent care expenses incurred so you and your spouse, if married, can work, look for work, or your spouse can attend school full-time. In addition to day care, the account may also cover some before- and after-school care expenses, summer day camp and pre-school tuition costs. Dependent Care FSa Minimum Maximum Annually $120.00 $5,000.00 12 pay period deductions $10.00 $416.66 24 pay period deductions $5.00 $208.33 20 or 21 Pay Faculty (19*) Scheduled deduction $6.00 $250.00 * 20 or 21 pay faculty members must contact the Personnel Office of their respective institution to determine their pay schedule for the multiple deduction pay periods. Multiple deduction schedules differ by institution. Tax SaVINGS WITH aN FSa An FSA lets you set money aside for eligible expenses before taxes are taken from your paycheck. This means the amount of income you pay taxes on is reduced, and, as a result, you save money. Let's assume \"Sue\" earns $35,000 a year and has $1,500 in eligible expenses. The example below illustrates what she will pay with an FSA and without an FSA.* With FSa Without FSa Annual pay $35,000 $35,000 Pre-tax contribution to FSA - $1,500 - $0 Taxable income = $33,500 = $35,000 Federal income and Social Security taxes - $7,362 - $7,852 After-tax dollars spent on eligible expenses - $0 - $1,500 Spendable income = $26,138 = $25,648 Tax savings with your FSa $490 * Sample tax savings for a single taxpayer with no dependents; actual savings will vary based on your individual tax situation; please consult a tax professional for more information. * As you can see, Sue saved $490 by enrolling in her FSA! How FSas Work Opening and using an FSA is quick and easy. Step 1. Determine how much money you need to set aside on an annual basis. Think about how much you spend each year on your medical plan copays, dental, vision, prescriptions and over-the-counter expenses like bandages, as well as money spent on dependent care and elder care. You may contribute up to the maximum amounts shown for each type of account. Since IRS regulations do not allow FSA funds to roll over from one year to the next, plan carefully when deciding how much to contribute. Use the FSA worksheet available at www.ConnectYourCare.com/statemd to estimate your expenses. FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNTS Maryland State Employees and Retirees 55 108363_dbm-Text.indd 54 3/11/11 8:15 AM - 54 s u m m a r y o f g e n e r a l b e n e f i t s j u l y 2 0 1 1 j u n e 2 0 1 2 Step 2. That amount is automatically deducted from your paycheck before taxes are applied in equal amounts, based on your frequency of pay, throughout the year. For example, if you decide to contribute $1,000 for the year, and you have 24 pay periods each year, you would have $41.66 deducted from each paycheck and credited to your FSA. Step 3. When you have eligible healthcare expenses, like copays for doctors' office visits or prescriptions, pay for them using your new healthcare payment card. For dependent day care expenses, pay using a personal form of payment and submit a claim for reimbursement. Be sure to keep your itemized receipts. Step 4. If ConnectYourCare is not able to verify your healthcare payment card purchase, CYC will request a copy of your receipt. For all dependent care expenses and for healthcare expenses not paid for with the payment card, you can submit a claim for reimbursement either online or by filling out a claim form. You must submit appropriate documentation to support your claim, such as an itemized receipt. Step 5. When you request reimbursement, ConnectYourCare will process your claim and reimburse you within a few working days. You can choose to set up direct deposit in your online account to have your reimbursements deposited directly into your personal banking account. Or, download a Direct Deposit form at www.ConnectYourCare.com/statemd. You may be reimbursed from your Healthcare FSA at any time throughout the plan year for expenses up to the annual amount you elected to contribute. This means you have your full contribution amount available to you on the first day of the plan year. However, you may only be reimbursed from the Dependent Care FSA up to the amount contributed to that point. If you submit a reimbursement request for more than your current balance, it will be held until additional contributions have been added to your account during subsequent payroll periods.

All eligible expenses are based on the State's benefit plan design and IRS regulations. There is a sample list of eligible expenses on page 57 of this guide.

SpeCial notiCe: FSa Distributions for reservists The Heroes Earning Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008 (HEART Act) allows plans to offer \"qualified reservist distributions\" of unused amounts in health flexible spending accounts (FSAs) to reservists ordered or called to active duty for at least 180 days or on an indefinite basis. An Employee must request a qualified reservist distribution on or after the date of the order to call to active duty, and before the last day of the plan year (or grace period, if applicable) during which the order or call to active duty occurred. The Employee Benefits Division must receive a copy of the order or call to active duty (or extension thereof) to confirm compliance with the 180-day/indefinite requirement. To request a distribution of unused amounts contributed to the Health FSA, submit your request in writing along with a copy of your orders to the Employee Benefits Division before the last day of the plan year (June 30). What is Covered The Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account is used for dependent day care expenses that allow you (or you and your spouse, if married) to work or look for work, or allow you to work and your spouse to attend school full-time. The care may be provided inside or outside your home and may include things like day care, before-and after-school programs, summer day camp and pre-school tuition. You may only submit claims for dependent care services already provided. Submitting a Claim for reimbursement If you pay for an expense out of pocket (without using your payment card), you may enter a secure claim for reimbursement online or using a paper claim form. There is no minimum reimbursement amount. Online Submission Step 1. Log into your online account at www.ConnectYourCare.com/statemd. Step 2. Click Add New Claim from the left-hand menu.

Sometimes called an FSA debit card, this payment card allows you to directly access funds in your account. How does the payment card work? The payment card is like a credit card, and it allows you to access your FSA funds quickly and easily. At many retailers, including many pharmacies and grocery stores (for eligible over-the-counter items), your charges may be automatically verified as an eligible expense, reducing the need for you to submit receipts. You may still have to submit receipts for some of your purchases (per IRS regulations), so you will need to keep your itemized receipts. When do I get my payment card? For new Healthcare FSA enrollee's, your payment card will be mailed to your house after the week of June 15, 2011. It will be automatically activated on July 1, 2011. The card will remain active for 3 years, so keep it even when your funds are depleted; the same card will be used for the next plan year's account. What types of items may I purchase using my payment card? Many eligible expenses can be paid for using the card, including prescriptions and certain over-the-counter items at most retailers, and doctors' charges at offices that accept major credit cards. Dependent Care FSA funds cannot be accessed using the card. Your card will not work at retail locations that do not offer healthcare items or medical services. What if I don't want to use the card or forget to use it? You may easily submit claims for reimbursement, either online or by using a paper form. This process will be necessary for all dependent care expenses and at times when using the payment card is not possible. However, it is always easier to use your card when you have the option. Where can I use my payment card? Your payment card can be used nationwide at qualified merchants. Examples of qualified merchants may include pharmacies, doctors' offices, vision centers, and hospitals. Your card should only be used to pay for medical expenses eligible under your plan, and you should always save your receipts. Paper Form Submission Step 1. Download a paper claim form from www.ConnectYourCare.com/statemd. Step 2. Complete the form. Step 3. Mail the form and your itemized receipts to the address on the form. Once your claim is received, you can track the status of your claim at any time at www.ConnectYourCare.com/ statemd. You'll receive your reimbursement within a few days. Set up direct deposit to receive reimbursements quickly. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Items Requiring Prescriptions Due to healthcare reform, all OTC items containing a drug or medication, like cold medicine, allergy treatment, and pain relievers, now require prescriptions for reimbursement. Some retailers will accept your OTC prescriptions at the point of sale and will allow you to use your payment card for these items. However, for many of these purchases, you will have to pay out of pocket and submit an online or paper claim for reimbursement. Be sure to include a valid prescription along with your receipt in order to be reimbursed. Please refer to www.ConnectYourCare.com/ statemd for more details. Direct Deposit You are eligible to receive reimbursement funds by check or direct deposit. For quicker reimbursements, sign up for direct deposit into your checking or savings account. You can sign up for direct deposit on the ConnectYourCare web site. Step 1. Log into your account and select Direct Deposit from the Home page under My Account. Step 2. Complete the short, secure form. Be sure to have your bank account and routing numbers on hand. Step 3.

Services may be provided at home or in a facility - and care may be provided by a professional or informal caregiver, such as a friend or family member. The Long Term Care (LTC) Insurance plan is offered through The Prudential Insurance Company of America (Prudential LTC). Commonly Asked Questions Why do I need LTC Insurance? Your odds of needing Long Term Care Insurance may be greater than you think. More than 2 in 5 people over the age of 65 will require nursing home care at some time in their lives. 1 It could be the result of spinal cord injury, heart attack, stroke, or age-related illness such as Parkinson's Disease or Alzheimer's Disease. How expensive is LTC? In Maryland, it can cost over $87,600 a year for nursing home care alone. 2 When people suddenly find themselves the primary caregiver for a loved one, the responsibility could result in a huge financial and emotional burden. Isn't care covered by other insurance? Disability income insurance provides no benefits for the services covered by LTC insurance - while Medicaid and Medicare have significant limitations. Am I too young for LTC insurance coverage? It's never too early to purchase coverage. You may be surprised to learn that 40% of LTC insurance benefit recipients are under the age of 65. 3 And the younger you are when you first purchase Long Term Care Insurance, generally the lower your premium for the life of your plan, regardless of your age or health status in later years. Can I get coverage for other family members, too? You can also extend coverage to qualifying family members (such as a spouse, parent, or grandparent). To be considered for enrollment, they will need to provide evidence of good health to Prudential. What happens to my coverage if I leave employment with or retire from the State of Maryland? The LTC Insurance plan is portable. If you leave employment with or retire from the State, you can take your LTC Insurance coverage with you. (Premiums and coverage will not change due to retiree status, but payment must be made directly to Prudential.) Are LTC premiums pre-tax deductions? No. Under Federal guidelines, LTC premiums cannot be pre-tax deductions. Can retirees and family members enroll in LTC insurance coverage? Yes.

Unlike other plans outlined in this guide, coverage may be elected for more than you and your dependents. Coverage under the LTC plan is offered to: a Legal Spouses; a Parents (in-laws included); a Grandparents (in-laws included); and a Children age 18 or older and their spouses. For each individual you choose to cover, you must select one of the plans listed below. Plan Option nursing home Care & Assisted Living facility Daily Maximum* home & Community- Based care daily Maximum* Lifetime Plan 8 $200 $100 $438,000 * Benefits are paid up to the daily maximum. ** All benefits paid will be deducted from the lifetime maximum. how the Plan Works In order to receive benefits, you must be confirmed as having a chronic illness or disability by a licensed health care practitioner. A qualifying chronic illness or disability is one in which there is: a A loss of the ability to perform, without substantial assistance, at least two of the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). This loss must be expected to continue for at least 90 days. ADLs are bathing, continence, dressing, eating, toileting, and transferring; or a A severe cognitive impairment, which requires substantial supervision to protect you from threats to your health and safety. BEnEfIT WAITIng/ELIMInATIOn Period Before you can receive benefits, you must satisfy the 90-day benefit waiting/elimination period. This period is counted in calendar days and begins on the date you are assessed, if you are determined to be eligible for benefits. You do not need to receive formal LTC services to satisfy the waiting period, and this waiting period only needs to be satisfied once during the period you are covered by the Prudential LTC plan. Periodic inflation Protection As part of the plan, you may increase your coverage on a periodic basis without submitting any additional health information (as long as you have not declined the previous two consecutive inflation offers). Inflation protection will be offered at least every three years to individuals who do not elect the optional automatic inflation protection feature.

Fraud and abuse can take many forms, including: Adding a dependent to your coverage who you know is not eligible for coverage; Submitting false or altered affidavits or documentation as part of adding or removing a dependent; Letting someone else who is not covered under your enrollment use your insurance card to get health benefits or services; Lying to get coverage or access to health benefits (such as prescription drugs or treatments) that are not medically necessary; Giving or selling your prescriptions to another person; or Submitting reimbursement requests for health benefits or services that were not provided. The Department of Budget and Management Employee Benefits Division must investigate allegations of fraud and abuse; each plan and benefit option has programs to look for and eliminate fraud and abuse. If fraud or abuse is determined to have taken place, there can be serious consequences, including: Lock-down of your prescription benefits to only one doctor or pharmacy; Termination of coverage; or Seeking repayment or reimbursement of any claims/ benefits that were inappropriately paid. There may also be serious criminal or civil consequences. notice About Disclosure and Use of your Social Security number A federal mandatory reporting law (Section 111 of Public Law 110-173) requires group health plans to report, as directed by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, information that the Secretary requires for purposes of coordination of benefits. Two key elements that will be required to be reported are social security numbers (SSNs) of covered individuals (or HICNs) and the plan sponsor's employer identification number (EIN). In order for Medicare to properly coordinate Medicare payments with other insurance and/or workers' compensation benefits, Medicare relies on the collection of both the SSN or HICN and the EIN, as applicable. As a member (or spouse or family member of a member) covered by a group health plan arrangement, your SSN and/or HICN will likely be requested in order to meet the requirements of this law. To get more information about the mandatory reporting requirements under this law, visit the CMS website at www.cms.hhs.gov/MandatoryInsRep. In addition, because of the tax benefits of employer-sponsored health benefits coverage, we need your SSN to make sure that your income tax and other employment-related taxes are calculated and withheld from your paycheck properly. LEAVE/COnTInUATIOn Of COVERAgE/COBRA While on Leave of Absence If you take a Leave of Absence Without Pay (LAW) you may continue the same health benefits coverage by electing to enroll and paying the full cost of your premiums. If you take a leave of absence pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), special rules govern the continuation of your health benefits. You have several options about your health benefits coverage while you are on FMLA leave, including whether to keep your coverage in place or drop it and how to pay for health benefits coverage while you are on FMLA leave. You should review the options and make an informed decision. Contact your Agency Benefits Coordinator for details, and visit the Employee Benefits Division website. Short-Term LAW If you are on short-term LAW (two pay periods or less for employees who are paid bi-weekly; up to 28 days), and it is neither FMLA leave nor due to a job-related accident or injury (LAW-OJI), you must pay the full cost (both employee share and State subsidy) of all missed premiums in order to continue your benefits for the rest of the plan year. You will receive a \"No Pay\" bill from the Employee Benefits Division for your missed premiums. Deductions may resume if you return to work before the due date on the \"No Pay\" bill. However, payment for the missed premiums is still due. If you do not pay by the due date on the \"No Pay\" bill, your enrollment and benefits coverage will be cancelled for the rest of the plan year. If your short term LAW is due to a job-related accident or injury (LAW-OJI), or an approved FMLA leave, you are entitled to the maximum State subsidy and are responsible for the employee's share of the premium only. When you receive your bill, please contact your Agency Benefits Coordinator, who will complete a retroactive adjustment form and collect your portion of the premiums. You must make up missed premiums within the requested timeframe or your enrollment and benefits coverage will be cancelled. There will be a break in your coverage until you return to work and request re-enrollment in health benefits. Payment deadlines are strictly enforced.

If you are on an approved long-term LAW, you may elect to continue or discontinue health insurance for the duration of the LAW. You may elect to continue your benefits during long-term LAW for up to two years. You must notify the Employee Benefits Division of your coverage election within 60 days of beginning your long\u00adterm LAW. You cannot retroactively terminate benefits and you may be required to pay the full premium for any period of coverage during your long-term LAW that has elapsed prior to your notification to terminate benefits during your long-term LAW. If you wish to continue, you must complete a Direct Pay enrollment form and submit it to your Agency Benefits Coordinator. This enrollment form should be completed as soon as you know you will miss two pay periods or more. The enrollment form will not be accepted any later than 60 days after the effective date of the LAW. You may continue any or all of your current health benefit plans, or you may reduce your coverage level when enrolling for LAW benefits. However, you may not change plans until the next Open Enrollment period or within 60 days of a qualifying event, the same as an Active employee. Once enrolled in coverage while on LAW, you are responsible for the full premium cost unless the LAW is due to a job-related accident or injury or an approved FMLA leave. If you are entitled to the State subsidy, your Agency Benefits Coordinator must have the Agency Fiscal Officer complete the applicable section of the Direct Pay enrollment form. The Employee Benefits Division will bill you for the appropriate amount due. Coupons and Payments** All State employees who are on a Leave of Absence Without Pay will be mailed payment coupons, which must be included with their premium payments at the address shown on the letter included with your premium coupons. Your benefits will be effective as of the date noted on your letter, but no claims will be paid until the Employee Benefits Division receives your payment. Payments are due the first of every month with a 30-day grace period. All benefits are inactive until payment is received for each month. Payment may be made in advance to cover any or all coupon(s) received, but must be made in full monthly increments. If payment is not received by the end of the 30-day grace period, your coverage will be cancelled. There will be a break in your coverage until you return to work and request re-enrollment in health benefits. This request for re-enrollment must be made through your Agency Benefits Coordinator within 60 days of your return to work. Payment deadlines are strictly enforced. If you do not receive these coupons within one month of signing your enrollment form or if you change your mailing address, please contact your Agency Benefits Coordinator or the Employee Benefits Division immediately. Military Leave Employees Important Information for Your Health While on Military Leave and When Returning to State Service Employees on Active Duty In recognition of the tremendous service of our employees who serve as members of the armed forces, the State of Maryland permits employees on active military duty to elect to continue their medical, dental, and prescription benefits at the same coverage level in effect just prior to the start of their military duty. The State will pay the full cost of coverage: both the employee and State share of premiums. State employees on active military duty may elect to continue coverage for accidental death and dismemberment insurance, life insurance, or flexible spending accounts by remitting payment for this coverage directly to the Employee Benefits Division. If elected, employees will be billed by the Direct-Pay unit through payment coupons. To continue your benefits under an Active Military Leave of Absence, you will need to complete the \"LAW - Military Notification Form.\" Please return this form to your Agency Benefits Coordinator along with a copy of your active military orders. If these orders expire, you will need to provide your Agency Benefits Coordinator with updated orders in order to continue Active Military Leave coverage with the State of Maryland. If you have questions concerning your benefits while on active military leave, please contact your Agency Benefits Coordinator. Employees Returning from Active Duty When an employee is returning from active duty, he/she should contact his/her Agency Benefits Coordinator to complete an Active enrollment form. The completed Regular enrollment form should be sent to the Employee Benefits Division along with the employee's discharge paperwork. COBRA and Continuation of Coverage You and/or your dependents may elect to continue your Health, Prescription Drug, Dental, and Health Care Spending Account participation, using post-tax premium payments, for a timeframe determined in accordance with the applicable Federal regulations.

The following memorandum entitled General Notice of COBRA and Continuation of Coverage Rights reviews your rights and responsibilities. It is important for you to review it carefully with all covered dependents. If you have questions about a qualifying event or continuation of coverage, please contact the Employee Benefits Division. ** See page 69 for more information. General notiCe of Continuation of CoveraGe (CoBra) riGhts The Employee Benefits Division has processed an enrollment for you as the employee/retiree, spouse, or covered dependent in the State Employee and Retiree Health and Welfare Benefits Program. This notice on possible future group health insurance continuation coverage rights applies individually to the active member (employee or retiree), the member's spouse/domestic partner and all covered dependent child(ren) enrolled under the State's benefits program. It is important that all covered individuals take the time to read this notice carefully and become familiar with its contents. If you are the employee, and if there is a covered dependent whose legal residence is not yours, please provide written notification of that covered dependent's address to the Employee Benefits Division so a notice can be sent to that covered dependent as well. You are receiving this notice because you have health benefits coverage under the State Employee and Retiree Health and Welfare Benefits Program (the Program). The Department of Budget and Management Employee Benefits Division administers the Program. The Program sponsored by the State of Maryland is a governmental group health plan covered by the Public Health Service Act, which includes the COBRA continuation of coverage provisions described in this Notice. This Notice explains continuation coverage rights for only these health benefits offered through the Program: the medical PPO, the medical POS, the medical EPO, the prescription plan, the dental PPO, the dental HMO and the Healthcare Flexible Spending Accounts. You may be enrolled in one or more of these benefits. This Notice does not apply to any other benefits offered by the State of Maryland or through the Program, such as the dependent care flexible spending accounts, life insurance benefit, long term care benefit, or accidental death and dismemberment insurance benefit. Under federal law, group health plans like the Program must offer covered employees and covered family members the opportunity for a temporary extension of health coverage (called COBRA) at group rates when coverage under the health plan would otherwise end due to certain qualifying events. In this Notice, the term \"covered employee\" also means \"covered retiree.\" This Notice is intended to inform all plan participants of potential future options and obligations related to COBRA and Continuation of Coverage for domestic partnerships. Should an actual qualifying event occur in the future, the State of Maryland would send you additional information and the appropriate election notice at that time. Please take special note, however, of your notification obligations that are highlighted in this Notice on page 69. Who is entitled to elect CoBra continuation coverage? Qualifying Events For Covered Employee If you are the covered employee, you may have the right to elect COBRA coverage if you lose group health coverage because of the following qualifying events: termination of your employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct on your part), resignation, layoff, or a reduction in your hours of employment. Qualifying Events For Covered Spouse If you are the covered spouse of an employee, you may have the right to elect COBRA coverage for yourself if you lose group health coverage under the Program because of any of the following qualifying events: 70 s u m m a r y o f g e n e r a l b e n e f i t s j u l y 2 0 1 1 - j u n e 2 0 1 2 108363_dbm-Text.indd 71 3/11/11 8:15 AM Maryland State Employees and Retirees 71 u A termination of your spouse's employment, including resignation and layoff, (for reasons other than gross misconduct); u A reduction in your spouse's hours of employment; u The death of your spouse; u Divorce from your spouse. If your spouse (the employee or retiree) reduces or eliminates your group health coverage in anticipation of your divorce and your divorce happens soon after that, then the divorce may be considered a qualifying event for you even though you lost coverage earlier than the date of the divorce. The rules of Program do not require you to lose coverage if you and your spouse are legally separated if you are still legally married to the employee or retiree. Qualifying Events For Covered Dependent Children If you are the covered dependent child of an employee, you may have the right to elect COBRA coverage for yourself if you lose group health coverage under the Program because of any of the following qualifying events: u A termination of the employee's employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct); u A reduction in the employee's hours of employment; u The death of the employee; u Parent's divorce or, if applicable, legal separation; u You cease to be a \"dependent child\" under the terms of the Program. Qualifying Events for Covered Same Sex Domestic Partner and Domestic Partner's Dependent Children As a domestic partner of an employee or retiree or the dependent child(ren) of a domestic partner, continuation coverage will be offered to you if you lose health benefits coverage as a result of any of the following events: u The termination of the domestic partnership with the employee or retiree; u The employee's termination of employment, or reduction of hours of employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct); u The death of the employee or retiree; u A dependent child of a domestic partner ceasing to meet the coverage eligibility requirements for a dependent child of a domestic partner (such as turning age 27 or ceasing to be a tax dependent of the domestic partner). Special Rule for newly born or adopted children: If a covered employee qualified beneficiary has or adopts a child during a period of COBRA continuation coverage, the new child may be eligible for COBRA continuation coverage that runs for the same period as your coverage. The child must meet the eligibility requirements of the Program. In the case of a newborn or adopted child that is added to a covered employee qualified beneficiary's COBRA coverage, then the first 60 days of continuation coverage for the new born or adopted child is measured from the date of the birth or the date of the adoption. Procedures and timelines for adding these individuals can be found in your benefits guide. Other important points: The plan administrator reserves the right to verify eligibility status and to terminate continuation coverage retroactively if a qualified beneficiary is determined to be ineligible or if there has been a material misrepresentation of the facts. A qualified beneficiary does not have to show they are insurable to elect COBRA or Continuation of Coverage. However, they must have been actually covered by the Program health benefits on the day before the event to be eligible for continuation coverage. When is COBRA or Continuation of Coverage available? Coverage starts from the day you lose coverage due to a qualifying event - usually the end of the payroll deduction period in which the qualifying event occurred. When the qualifying event is the end of employment, reduction of employment hours or death of the employee, the Program will offer this coverage to qualified beneficiaries. Qualified beneficiaries are the employee, the spouse/domestic partner and the dependent children of the employee and domestic partner who lost group health coverage as a result of the qualifying event. You will not need to notify the Employee Benefits Division of any of these three qualifying events because your employing agency should notify the Employee Benefits Division of those events. You will need to notify the Employee Benefits Division of any other qualifying event. Important: Notifications Required By the Employee, Spouse/Domestic Partner and Dependent For the other qualifying events (divorce, dissolution of domestic partnership and a covered dependent ceasing to meet the definition of a \"dependent\" under the Program's rules), you must notify the Employee Benefits Division within 63 days of the later of these two dates: (1) the date of the event or (2) the date on which health plan coverage would be lost under the terms of the Program because of the qualifying event. If you do not notify the Employee Benefits Division of the qualifying event within 63 days, you will lose the right to elect COBRA or Continuation of Coverage. Under federal law, this is the responsibility of all employees, spouses and covered dependent children (or the parent of covered dependent children). To provide the required notification, you must contact the Employee Benefits Division and request that an enrollment form be mailed to you. You then fill out the form, attach documentation of the qualifying event (e.g. copy of divorce decree or dissolution of domestic partnership), and mail everything to: Employee Benefits Division, ATTN: Direct ImPORTaNT Notices and Information Maryland State Employees and Retirees 73 108363_dbm-Text.indd 72 3/11/11 8:15 AM - 72 s u m m a r y o f g e n e r a l b e n e f i t s j u l y 2 0 1 1 j u n e 2 0 1 2 Pay Unit, 301 West Preston Street, Room 510, Baltimore, Maryland 21201. If this notification is not completed according to these procedures and within the required 63-day notification period, then rights to continuation coverage will be forfeited. Carefully read the dependent eligibility rules contained in this benefit guide so all covered members are familiar with when a dependent ceases to be a dependent under the terms of the plan. Copies of the COBRA form may also be obtained from the internet site. how much does COBRA coverage cost? A qualified beneficiary will have to pay the entire applicable premium plus a 2% administration charge for continuation coverage. The State of Maryland does not subsidize COBRA coverage. These premiums will be adjusted during the continuation period if the applicable premium amount changes. In addition, if continuation coverage is extended from 18 months to 29 months due to a Social Security disability, the State of Maryland can charge up to 150% of the applicable premium during the extended coverage period for the disabled beneficiary. Qualified beneficiaries will be allowed to pay on a monthly basis. Premiums are due on the first day of every month. There will be a maximum grace period of thirty (30) days for the regularly scheduled monthly premiums. how Do I Elect COBRA or Continuation of Coverage? Each qualified beneficiary will have an independent right to elect COBRA or Continuation of Coverage; parents may elect COBRA coverage on behalf of minor children who were covered dependents. The Employee Benefits Division will send you an Election Notice outlining your rights to COBRA or Continuation of Coverage after it receives notification of a qualifying event from you or the employee's agency. Each qualified beneficiary has 63 days from the date of the Election Notice (or the date the health plan coverage was lost if later) to elect COBRA or Continuation of Coverage. This is the maximum period allowed to elect continuation coverage. If a qualified beneficiary does not elect continuation coverage within this election period, then rights to continue health insurance will end and the individual will cease to be a qualified beneficiary. Each qualified beneficiary has the right to elect COBRA or Continuation of Coverage in the group health benefits the qualified beneficiary had on the last day of coverage in the Program. For example, if the qualified beneficiary is enrolled in a medical POS plan and the prescription plan but not a dental plan on the last day of coverage before the qualifying event, the qualified beneficiary may elect to continue coverage in that medical POS plan and in the prescription plan but may not add coverage under a dental plan during the COBRA Election Period. COBRA or Continuation of Coverage is required to be identical to the coverage provided under the plan to similarly situated non-COBRA participants and/or covered dependents. Should coverage change or be modified for non-COBRA participants, then the change and/or modification will be made to your COBRA coverage as well. how long does COBRA continuation coverage last? COBRA coverage is a temporary continuation of coverage. Depending on the nature of the qualifying event that caused the loss of coverage, COBRA coverage may last a maximum of 18 months or 36 months, except in the case of COBRA continuation coverage in a health care flexible spending arrangement. If you are participating in a health care flexible spending account at the time of the qualifying event, you will only be allowed to continue the health care flexible spending account until the end of the current plan year in which the qualifying event occurs. See below for a description of how COBRA continuation coverage may end earlier than these maximum periods. Length of Continuation Coverage - 18 Months If the event causing the loss of coverage is a termination of employment (other than for reasons of gross misconduct, resignation or layoff) or a reduction in work hours, then each qualified beneficiary will have the opportunity to continue coverage for 18 months from the date of the qualifying event. This 18-month coverage may be extended only in limited situations: (1) when the qualified beneficiary receives a Social Security disability determination, (2) when a second qualifying event occurs during COBRA continuation coverage, and (3) when the employee had become eligible for Medicare within 18 months before the termination of employment or reduction in hours (see below for explanation). You must notify the Employee Benefits Division in writing within 63 days of these events in order to be eligible for an extension of the maximum coverage period. Failure to do so could mean that you cannot extend your coverage period. Social Security Disability The 18 months of continuation coverage can be extended for an additional 11 months of coverage, to a maximum of 29 months, for all qualified beneficiaries if the Social Security Administration determines a qualified beneficiary was disabled according to Title II or XVI of the Social Security Act on the date of the qualifying event or at any time during the first 60 days of coverage. The disability must last during the entire 18 months of continuation coverage. It is the qualified beneficiary's responsibility to obtain this disability determination from the Social Security Administration and provide a copy of the determination to 72 s u m m a r y o f g e n e r a l b e n e f i t s j u l y 2 0 1 1 - j u n e 2 0 1 2 108363_dbm-Text.indd 73 3/11/11 8:15 AM Maryland State Employees and Retirees 73 the Employee Benefits Division within 60 days after the later of: the date of the determination, the date of the termination of employment of reduction in hours, or the date the original 18-month coverage period expires. This notice must be provided no later than the date the original 18-month coverage period expires. If you do not notify the Employee Benefit Division in writing within the time frame, you may lose the ability to extend this coverage. This extension applies separately to each qualified beneficiary. If the disabled qualified beneficiary chooses not to continue coverage, all other qualified beneficiaries are still eligible for the extension. If coverage is extended, and the disabled qualified beneficiary has elected the extension, then the applicable premium rate is 150% of the premium rate. If only the non-disabled qualified beneficiaries extend coverage, the premium rate will remain at the 102% level. It is also the qualified beneficiary's responsibility to notify the Employee Benefits Division within 30 days if a final determination has been made that they are no longer disabled. Secondary Qualifying Events Another extension of the 18 or above mentioned 29-month continuation period could occur, if during the 18 or 29 months of continuation coverage, a second event takes place (divorce, legal separation, dissolution of domestic partnership, death, or a dependent child ceasing to be a dependent) that would have caused the qualifying beneficiary to lose coverage under the Program if the first qualifying event (termination of employment of reduction of hours) had not occurred. If a second event occurs, then the original 18 or 29 months of continuation coverage can be extended to 36 months from the date of the original qualifying event date for eligible dependent qualified beneficiaries. If a second event occurs, it is the qualified beneficiary's responsibility to notify the Employee Benefits Division in writing within 60 days of the second event and within the original 18 or 29 month continuation period. In no event, however, will continuation coverage last beyond 36 months from the date of the first qualifying event that originally made the qualified beneficiary eligible for continuation coverage. A reduction in hours followed by a termination of employment is not a second qualifying event. Length of Continuation Coverage - 36 Months If the original event causing the loss of coverage was the death of the employee, dissolution of domestic partnership or a dependent child ceasing to be a dependent child, then each qualified beneficiary of the employee will have the opportunity to continue coverage for 36 months from the date of the qualifying event. When the employee had become entitled to Medicare benefits less than 18 months before the termination of employment or reduction in work hours, the covered spouse and covered dependent qualifying beneficiaries may be entitled to continued coverage for up to 36 months. This extension does not apply to the employee, who will only have a maximum of 18 months of COBRA coverage unless a special extension such as the result of a secondary qualifying event occurs. The 36-month coverage period cannot be extended. Length of Continuation Coverage - Indefinitely If the original event causing the loss of group health coverage was a divorce from the employee, the qualified beneficiary will have the opportunity to continue coverage indefinitely under Maryland law. This indefinite period of coverage will end when any of the following happens: (1) Program coverage for the employee terminates, (2) the qualified beneficiary obtains coverage elsewhere (including Medicare), or (3) the qualified beneficiary who is the former spouse remarries. This indefinite period of continuation coverage is a result of a Maryland state law that is similar to COBRA and does not apply to health care flexible spending arrangements. However, the dependent child qualified beneficiary will also lose coverage when the child does not meet Program eligibility requirements under standard COBRA rules. Former stepchildren of the covered employee do not gain access to indefinite continuation coverage under these provisions of Maryland law. Potential Conversion Rights: At the end of the 18, 29, or 36 months of continuation coverage, a qualified beneficiary will be allowed to enroll in an individual conversion health plan if an individual conversion plan is available at that time. Early Termination of Continuation Coverage The time frames described above are only potential maximum periods for COBRA or Continuation of Coverage. COBRA coverage can end before those periods finish. The law provides that your continuation coverage will end prior to the maximum continuation period for any of the following reasons: u State of Maryland ceases to provide any group health plan to any of its employees; u Any required premium for continuation coverage is not paid in a timely manner; u A qualified beneficiary first becomes, after the date of COBRA election, covered under another group health Plan that does not enforce any exclusion or limitation with respect to any preexisting condition(s) of the beneficiary; u A qualified beneficiary first becomes, after the date of COBRA election, entitled to Medicare; u A qualified beneficiary extended continuation coverage to 29 months due to a Social Security disability and a final determination has been made that the qualified beneficiary is no longer disabled; u A qualified beneficiary notifies the State of Maryland, ImPORTaNT Notices and Information Maryland State Employees and Retirees 75 108363_dbm-Text.indd 74 3/11/11 8:15 AM - 74 s u m m a r y o f g e n e r a l b e n e f i t s j u l y 2 0 1 1 j u n e 2 0 1 2 Employee Benefits Division they wish to cancel continuation coverage; u For cause, on the same basis that the plan terminates the coverage of similarly situated on-COBRA participants. Is COBRA continuation coverage for my healthcare flexible Spending Account Different? Yes. COBRA continuation coverage for the Healthcare Flexible Spending Account (HCFSA) will be offered only to qualified beneficiaries losing coverage through the end of the plan year in which the qualifying event occurs to domestic partners and domestic partner's children. This coverage cannot be extended beyond the end of the plan year, regardless of the qualifying event or whether a second qualifying event occurs. The use it or lose it rule will still apply so any unused amounts will be forfeited at the end of the plan year and COBRA coverage will terminate at the end of the plan year. You must pay a premium for continued HCFSA coverage that includes a 2% administrative charge for the coverage. Unless otherwise elected, all qualified beneficiaries who were covered under the HCFSA will be covered together for HCFSA COBRA coverage. However, each qualified beneficiary could elect to exercise HCFSA COBRA election rights individually to cover the qualified beneficiary only, with a separate HCFSA limit and a separate premium. Notification of Address Change To ensure all covered individuals receive information properly and timely, you are required to notify the State of Maryland, Employee Benefits Division of any address change as soon as possible. The Employee Benefits Division must have your current address at all times. A Change of Address Notification form is available on-line at www.dbm. maryland.gov, Employee Benefits link. Instructions for completing and filing the form are at the bottom of the form. Failure on your part to follow the instructions will result in delayed notifications or a loss of continuation coverage options. how do I notify the Employee Benefits Division if this notice advises I must provide notification to protect my rights? In every instance that you must provide notice to the Employee Benefits Division in order to protect your rights, whether the notice is of a first or second qualifying event, Social Security disability, or the addition of a new qualified beneficiary, you must provide written notice to the Employee Benefits Division at the address at the bottom of this Notice. You may be asked to complete a form and provide additional documentation. Failure to provide a required notice to the Employee Benefits Division within the required time period may cause you to lose your COBRA rights. Any Questions? Remember, except for notifying you of your responsibilities to notify the Employee Benefits Division of a divorce, dissolution of domestic partnership or a dependent child ceasing to meet Program eligibility requirements, this notice is simply a summary of your potential future options. Should an actual qualifying event occur and it is determined that you are eligible for continuation; you will be notified of all your actual rights at that time as part of the COBRA Election Notice.

To comply with this law, we are asking that you not provide any genetic information when responding to any request for medical information. \"Genetic information,\" as defined by GINA, includes an individual's family medical history, the results of an individual's or family member's genetic tests, the fact that an individual or an individual's family member sought or received genetic services, and genetic information of a fetus carried by an individual or an individual's family member or an embryo lawfully held by an individual or family member receiving assistive reproductive services. medicaid aNd tHe cHildreN's HealtH iNsuraNce Program (cHiP) If you are eligible for health coverage from your employer, but are unable to afford the premiums, some States have premium assistance programs that can help pay for coverage. These States use funds from their Medicaid or CHIP programs to help people who are eligible for employer-sponsored health coverage, but need assistance in paying their health premiums. If you or your dependents are already enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP and you live in a State listed on page 78, you can contact your State Medicaid or CHIP office to find out if premium assistance is available. If you or your dependents are NOT currently enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, and you think you or any of your dependents might be eligible for either of these programs, you can contact your State Medicaid or CHIP office or dial 1-877-KIDS NOW or www.insurekidsnow.gov to find out how to apply. If you qualify, you can ask the State if it has a program that might help you pay the premiums for an employer-sponsored plan. Once it is determined that you or your dependents are eligible for premium assistance under Medicaid or CHIP, your employer's health plan is required to permit you and your dependents to enroll in the plan - as long as you and your dependents are eligible, but not already enrolled in the employer's plan. This is called a \"special enrollment\" opportunity, and you must request coverage within 60 days of being determined eligible for premium assistance. If you live in one of the States listed on page 78, you may be eligible for assistance paying your employer health plan premiums. The list of States is current as of November 3, 2010. You should contact your State for further information on eligibility. To see if any more States have added a premium assistance program since November 3, 2010, or for more information on special enrollment rights, you can contact either: U.S. Department of Labor Employee Benefits Security Administration www.dol.gov/ebsa 1-866-444-EBSA (3272) U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services www.cms.hhs.gov 1-877-267-2323, Ext. 61565 OMB Control Number 1210-0137 (expires 09/30/2013) IMPORTANT Notices and Information Maryland State Employees and Retirees 79 108363_dbm-Text.indd 78 3/11/11 8:15 AM - 78 s u m m a r y o f g e n e r a l b e n e f i t s j u l y 2 0 1 1 j u n e 2 0 1 2 If you live in one of the following States, you may be eligible for assistance paying your employer health plan premiums.

Their State benefits coverage must continue as primary coverage, as long as they are Active employees. However, retirees and dependents of retirees must enroll in both Medicare Parts A & B as soon as they are eligible (due to age or disability) to have full claims coverage. If you are a retiree or a covered dependent of a retiree and you are eligible for Medicare, Parts A & B become your primary insurance and the State health plan becomes a supplemental policy to Medicare. Medicare Part A helps pay for hospital care, some skilled nursing facility care, and hospice care; Medicare Part B helps pay for physician charges and other medical services. If you are an employee, retiree, or a covered dependent that has Medicare entitlement because of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), see the ESRD rules that follow. Retirees and/or their dependents enrolled in the State Health Benefits Program must enroll in both Parts A & B to have full coverage as soon as they are eligible, either due to age or disability. The State plan will cover only that portion of hospital and medical bills not covered by Medicare. If you and/or your covered dependents are eligible for, but not enrolled in both Parts A & B, you will become responsible for the claims costs that Medicare would have paid. Age: Even If you Are not Collecting For most individuals who are not disabled, Medicare eligibility begins on the first day of the month in which they reach age 65. However, if you were born on the first day of a month, your Medicare eligibility begins on the first day of the month prior to the month in which you reach age 65. In order to have full coverage, retirees and their covered dependents must enroll in Parts A & B at age 65, regardless of what the Social Security Administration determines to be your full retirement age. Even if you do not wish to start receiving your Social Security retirement benefit, you must still enroll in Medicare Parts A & B. You will be billed directly by the Social Security Administration for your Part B premium. For information on how to enroll in Medicare, call the Social Security Administration at 1-800-772-1213. Disability Persons who are certified as being disabled by the Social Security Administration become eligible for Medicare two years (24 months) after their disability determination date. Retirees and their covered dependents enrolled in the State's benefits program MUST enroll in Medicare Parts A & B if eligible due to disability, regardless of their age, in order to receive the maximum coverage available. If Social Security denies Medicare coverage, you must provide a copy of the Social Security's denial to the Employee Benefits Division. If your Medicare entitlement is due to disability and the Social Security Administration determines that your disability status ends, please provide the Employee Benefits Division documentation from the Social Security Administration stating when Medicare entitlement ended. It is your responsibility to notify the Employee Benefits Division of Medicare entitlement due to disability. If the retiree and covered dependents fail to enroll in Medicare Parts A & B, the member will be responsible for the Medicare portion (about 80%) of all eligible services. The State will only pay as Medicare Supplemental Coverage (about 20%) towards eligible services. End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) The information in this section only pertains to individuals who, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, are eligible for Medicare based on ESRD, not based on age or disability. Individuals who have ESRD may be eligible for coverage under Medicare Parts A and B. It is strongly recommended that all employees, retirees, and their covered dependents who have ESRD read the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services publication, Medicare Coverage for Kidney Dialysis and Kidney Transplant Services before making any decisions about whether or not to enroll in Medicare Part A and/or Part B. To obtain a copy of this publication, visit a local Social Security office, call toll-free to 1-800-772-1213, or visit the website www.socialsecurity.gov and select Other Medicare Information (under the heading, Medicare), then select More Medicare Publications and finally, select Medicare Coverage of Kidney Dialysis and Kidney Transplant Services. The information below regarding the Coordination of Benefits (COB) for Medicare due to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) pertains to individuals enrolled in an Active employee group only. During the 30-Month COB Period When Medicare entitlement due to ESRD begins, there is a 30-month COB period (determined by Social Security) during which Active employee group coverage remains the primary insurer, regardless of whether or not the individual is enrolled in Medicare Part A and/or Part B. Employees should never change their coverage level in the State health plan to a Medicare coverage level during their 30-month COB period. meDICaRe and Your State Benefits Maryland State Employees and Retirees 81 108363_dbm-Text.indd 80 3/11/11 8:15 AM - 80 s u m m a r y o f g e n e r a l b e n e f i t s j u l y 2 0 1 1 j u n e 2 0 1 2 After the 30-Month COB Period NOTE: Individuals enrolled in a medical plan under the State's program and whose coverage is in an Active employee group are not required to enroll in Medicare. However, if the individual chooses to enroll in Medicare Part A only, or both Parts A and B due to an ESRD entitlement (determined by Social Security), their claims will be processed according to the COB regulations provided below. Employees/dependents enrolled in both Parts A and B: Medicare becomes the primary insurer for both Part A (hospital) and Part B (medical) claims. The employee should complete an Active employee enrollment form to change their enrollment in the State medical plan to a Medicare coverage level. Employees/dependents enrolled in Part A, but not enrolled in Part B: Medicare becomes the primary insurer for Part A (hospital) claims. In order for the State plan to remain the primary insurer for Part B (medical) claims, enrollment in the State medical plan should not be changed to a Medicare coverage level. Employees/dependents not enrolled in Part A or Part B: There will be no COB with Medicare. The State plan will continue to be the primary insurer for both Part A (hospital) and Part B (medical) claims. Enrollment in the State medical plan should not be changed to a Medicare coverage level. After a successful kidney transplant Three years after a successful kidney transplant, Medicare is no longer the primary insurer. If Medicare eligibility ends, the employee should contact the SSA to confirm that both Part A and Part B have been cancelled. When the employee receives a cancellation letter from the SSA, if the employee is enrolled in a State medical plan with a Medicare coverage level, an Active employee enrollment form should be submitted to change to a non-Medicare coverage level. The following link is for a 56-page Social Security publication, Medicare Coverage of Kidney Dialysis and Kidney Transplant Services: www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/10128.pdf Active employees and their dependents covered by a State medical plan who are eligible for Medicare due to ESRD will have their claims processed as follows.

If you have prescription drug coverage through the State Employee and Retiree Health and Welfare Benefits Program, you are not required to enroll in Medicare Part D. For most people, keeping the State coverage and not enrolling in a Medicare Part D plan will be the most cost-effective prescription drug coverage. However, you should consider the premium, copay, coinsurance, deductible, and coverage gap costs under the plans you are considering to make the best decision for your personal coverage. For the 2011-2012 plan year, the State of Maryland Prescription Drug Plan continues to be as good as, or better than, the standard Medicare Part D plan. See the Notice of Creditable Coverage in this guide. If you have State prescription drug coverage, the Notice of Creditable coverage means that if you decide to keep the State prescription drug coverage and not enroll in Medicare Part D, you will be permitted to enroll in Medicare Part D at a later time without paying a higher premium, as long as you do not have a break in coverage of 63 or more days. Retirees and Their Covered Dependents As a retiree or a dependent of a retiree, if you decide to buy the Medicare Part D coverage and keep your State prescription coverage, Medicare Part D will become your primary source of prescription drug coverage, and the State coverage will be secondary. In other words, Medicare will pay benefits first, and then the State coverage will coordinate with the benefits that Medicare pays. Remember, you will have to pay both monthly premiums. Here's How the State Plan Will Work as Your Secondary Coverage When You Have Primary Coverage Through Medicare Part D u You will give the pharmacist your Medicare Part D card first as your primary insurance and your State prescription card as your secondary insurance. u You must meet an annual Medicare Part D deductible before Medicare will begin to pay benefits. During this time, your State coverage will pay benefits and you will only be required to pay the applicable copays for State coverage. Once your copays combined with the State payments reach the annual Medicare deductible, Medicare will begin paying benefits. Your true out-of\u00adpocket (TROOP) cost for the Part D plan will only reflect what you paid, and not what the State paid. u After you have met any Medicare annual deductible, Medicare Part D will pay their portion of eligible costs of the drugs on their preferred drug list, up to the determined coverage gap. The State will pay benefits and will make up the difference between what Medicare pays, if anything, and the applicable State copay you are required to pay. u When the amount of State copays you have paid during the fiscal year reaches $1,000 individual/$1,500 family you will have met the out-of-pocket maximum for the State prescription drug coverage. This means the State plan pays for eligible expenses not covered by your Medicare Part D plan in full for the rest of the plan year. You should still give your pharmacist your Medicare Part D card. meDICaRe and Your State Benefits Maryland State Employees and Retirees 83 108363_dbm-Text.indd 82 3/11/11 8:15 AM - 82 s u m m a r y o f g e n e r a l b e n e f i t s j u l y 2 0 1 1 j u n e 2 0 1 2 Initial Enrollment Period Schedule Sample Initial Enrollment Period for Individuals with birth dates between April 2nd and 30th MONTH ENROLLED PART B COvERAgE STARTS MONTH ENROLLED PART B COvERAgE STARTS 1st month 1st day of the month you reach age 65* January April 1st 2nd month 1st day of the month you reach age 65* February April 1st 3rd month 1st day of the month you reach age 65* march April 1st 4th month One month delay April May 1st 5th month Two month delay May July 1st 6th month Three month delay June September 1st 7th month Three month delay July October 1st To find your Initial Enrollment Period, circle the month *If you were born on the first day of the month, move your you turn 65 and the three months before and after. schedule back one month.

If that coverage is creditable coverage, you can wait to enroll in Medicare Part D until a later time, and you will not pay more for your Part D premium when you enroll, as long as you do not have a break in coverage of 63 or more days. Initial, Special, and General Enrollment Periods for Medicare Parts A & B When you reach age 65, if your health benefits coverage is under a retiree's policy and you do not enroll in both Medicare Parts A & B, you will not have full claims coverage and your Part B premium may be penalized when you enroll later. If your health benefits coverage is under an Active employee's policy when you reach age 65, you do not have to enroll in Medicare until you retire, unless your employment or coverage under an Active employee's policy will end during your initial enrollment period. See the Special Enrollment Period information table on the left. Initial Enrollment Period is the seven-month period for Medicare due to reaching age 65, as follows: u If you reach age 65 on the 1st day of the month - Medicare eligibility begins the 1st day of the previous month; Example: If your birthday is January 1st, you are eligible for Medicare on December 1st. u If you reach age 65 on the 2nd day through the last day of the month - Medicare eligibility begins the 1st day of the month you turn 65; Example: If your birthday is January 2nd - 31st, you are eligible for Medicare on January 1st. Your Initial Enrollment Period begins three months prior to the month you are eligible for Medicare and ends three months after the month you are eligible for Medicare. The chart on the left shows the schedule for an Initial Enrollment Period and a sample schedule for a birth date of April 2nd - 30th. Special Enrollment Period is an eight-month period beginning the month your group coverage ends or the month employment ends, whichever comes first. If you were eligible for Medicare, but didn't enroll because you had health benefits under an Active employee's policy, you can enroll during your Special Enrollment Period without penalty to your Part B premium. Special enrollment period rules don't apply if employment or Active employee group coverage ends during your initial enrollment period. General Enrollment Period is a three month \"Open Enrollment\" period for Medicare each year from January 1st through March 31st for Part B coverage to start on July 1st of the same year. If you were eligible but not enrolled in Medicare and you did not have health benefits coverage under an Active employee's policy, your Part B premium will be penalized 10% for every 12 months you were entitled to Part B but not enrolled. If your Initial Enrollment Period or Special Enrollment Period enrollment falls between January 1st and March 31st, it is extremely important that you make it clear to the Social Security Administration representative you have an initial or special enrollment period. Otherwise, you may be enrolled as a general enrollment and your Part B coverage will not start until July 1st and your Part B premium may be penalized. Medicare Due to Disability The same rules apply if you are entitled to Medicare due to a disability. If you have health benefits coverage under an Active employee's policy, you do not have to enroll in Medicare. However, when your employment or Active employee coverage ends, you must apply for Medicare Parts A & B in order to have full claims coverage. Otherwise, you will be responsible for the portion of claims that Medicare would have paid, had you been enrolled.

This notice applies to all State of Maryland employees, retirees, and dependents who are entitled to Medicare and are enrolled in the current prescription drug plan through the State Employees and Retirees Health Benefits Program (\"our Program\") and has information about our Program's prescription drug coverage. It also explains the options you have under Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage and can help you decide whether or not you want to enroll. At the end of this notice is information about where you can get help to make decisions about your prescription drug coverage. IMPORTAnT POInTS TO REMEMBER u Medicare prescription drug coverage (\"Medicare Part D\") became available in 2006 to everyone with Medicare. You can get this coverage if you join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan or join a Medicare Advantage Plan (like an HMO or PPO) that offers prescription drug coverage. All Medicare prescription drug plans provide at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare. Some plans may also offer more coverage for a higher monthly premium. u The State of Maryland has determined that the prescription drug coverage offered through our Program is creditable coverage. Creditable coverage means that, on average for all plan participants, our Program is expected to pay out as much or more than the standard Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage will pay. It also means that if you keep our Program's coverage and do not enroll in a Medicare prescription plan now, you will not pay extra if you later decide to enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan, so long as you do not have a break in coverage of 63 continuous days or more. If you go 63 continuous days or longer without prescription drug coverage that's at least as good as Medicare's prescription drug coverage, your monthly premium will go up at least 1% per month for every month that you did not have that coverage. For example, if you go nineteen months without coverage, your premium will always be at least 19% higher than what many other people pay. You'll have to pay this higher premium as long as you have Medicare prescription drug coverage. In addition, you may have to wait until the following November to enroll. u Individuals can enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan when they first become eligible for Medicare and each year from November 15th through December 31st. In addition, if you cancel or lose coverage with our Program, you may be eligible for a Special Enrollment Period to sign up for a Medicare prescription drug plan. You should compare your current coverage, including which drugs are covered, with the coverage and cost of the Medicare prescription drug plans in your area. Remember, our Program will only cover eligible dependents in a plan in which you are enrolled as well. If you are eligible for Medicare prescription drug coverage, you have the right to: u Keep our Program's coverage and not enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan; u Enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan and drop our Program's coverage; or u Enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan and keep our Program's coverage.* * If your coverage in our Program is as a retiree or a covered dependent of a retiree, your Medicare prescription drug plan will be your primary coverage. 84 s u m m a r y o f g e n e r a l b e n e f i t s j u l y 2 0 1 1 - j u n e 2 0 1 2 108363_dbm-Text.indd 85 3/11/11 8:15 AM Maryland State Employees and Retirees 85 u If you decide to enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan and drop your prescription drug coverage through our Program, you may not be able to get our Program coverage back until our next Open Enrollment period or when you cancel or lose your Medicare prescription drug coverage. If you lose or cancel Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage, you may be able to re-enroll in our Program before the next annual Open Enrollment period if you request re-enrollment with the employee Benefits Division within 60 days and you have had a change in circumstances that permits a mid-year change in enrollment. See the annual Benefits Guide section entitled \"Enrollment and Changes Outside of Open Enrollment\" on page 18 for more information. If you drop our Program coverage for prescription benefits, your dependent(s) will also lose coverage under our Program's prescription plan. If you cancel your coverage under our Program's prescription drug plan, you are still eligible for enrollment in our Program's other types of coverage, such as health and dental plans. Prescription coverage is elected separate from these other coverages. u Keep this notice with your important papers. If you enroll in one of the Part D plans approved by Medicare that offer prescription drug coverage, you may need to give a copy of this notice when you join to show that you are not required to pay a higher premium amount.
