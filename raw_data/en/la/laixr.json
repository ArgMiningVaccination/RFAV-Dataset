You are not alone. Many people feel tired, foggy, sluggish, or lack motivation on a day-to-day basis. Feeling low on energy not only decreases your productivity but also affects your emotional health in many ways. While there is no shortage of energy supplements, there are many natural ways to energize your mind. Read on to find how to boost your energy levels with Ayurveda and aromatherapy. Stay hydrated - cut back on caffeine Reaching out for the fourth cup of coffee may seem the best thing to do when you are feeling sluggish, but it actually is counterproductive! Too much caffeine is known to increase cortisol (stress hormones) levels, which not only interferes with sleep but also suppresses the body's natural immune function and affects overall health. Moreover, it can cause dehydration - another reason for low energy levels. Ayurveda, the ancient Indian medicinal and wellness practice, advises against the intake of caffeinated, carbonated, and alcoholic beverages. Rather, sip herbal tea or try replacing your regular coffee with a decaffeinated one. Also, try to drink loads and loads of water, as a hydrated mind is also a focused mind. In a 2012 [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22190027/), mild hydration of 1.36% significantly reduced concentration, degraded mood, and increased the perception of task difficulty in healthy women. Some participants also reported headaches and fatigue symptoms. Sleep better Sleep plays an important role in almost every aspect of wellbeing, including your energy levels. When you are adequately rested, you will naturally feel less tired and energized throughout the day. On the other hand, poor quality of sleep is one of the most common reasons for feeling lethargic all day. Stress, overuse of caffeine or alcohol, overexposure to electronic devices, and lack of routine are some of the factors that interfere with sleep. Essential oils are one of the most effective and time-honoured ways to improve sleep quality. In a 2005 [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16298774/), exposure to lavender oil before bed improved the percentage of slow-wave sleep (also known as deep sleep or restorative sleep) in healthy men and women. As a result, all participants reported higher energy levels and elevated mood in the morning. Chamomile is another great essential oil for sleep, well-known for its profoundly relaxing effects on the nervous system. Using a pillow mist containing these oils such as [Sleepy Head](https://madebycoopers.com/collections/aromatherapy-sprays/products/room-pillow-sleep-spray) by Made By Coopers or diffusing oils in an electric diffuse such as [Calm essential oil ](https://madebycoopers.com/collections/essential-oil-blends/products/calm-essential-oil-blend)blend. Taking ayurvedic herbs like Brahmi or Ashwagandha before bed is also a great way to naturally sleep better. Besides, these herbs have added benefits as many studies have reported their immune-boosting, cognition-enhancing, and stress-relieving abilities. Lemongrass oil The reinvigorating citrus aroma of lemongrass oil has been used for centuries to boost energy levels. Used in aromatherapy, it increases mental alertness, improves focus, relieves stress, and calms emotional turbulence. Quite paradoxically, many people find its scent relaxing and calming that helps them sleep better. Either way, lemongrass has an overall calming effect on the central nervous system, which means it will help you sleep better at night, while also boosting energy levels during the daytime. Look for the [Revive atmosphere mist](https://madebycoopers.com/collections/aromatherapy-sprays/products/revive-atmosphere-spray-mist) or candle by Made By Coopers. Peppermint oil Peppermint oil undoubtedly is one of the most widely used essential oils for stimulation on the planet. Its alluring, refreshing, empowering aroma can easily fill a room within minutes, shaking off all the lethargic feelings or fogginess of mind. In one 2008 [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18041606/#:~:text=Peppermint%20was%20found%20to%20enhance,it%2C%20but%20significantly%20increased%20calmness.), peppermint oil was found to improve memory and increase mental alertness. To enjoy the benefits, add 4-5 drops of peppermint oil or peppermint based oil blend such as [Invigorate](https://madebycoopers.com/collections/essential-oil-blends/products/invigorate-essential-oil-blend) by Made By Coopers to your home diffusers. Roller bottles are another great way to carry your energy potions on the go. Combine 4-5 drops with 10 ml of grapeseed oil in a roller bottle. Apply on the inner wrists, neck, or feet whenever you want to feel energized. If you are interested in uplifting your mood through use of essential oils too, why not check out our [Top 5 "}
