Leeds, DVM, DACVS Surgical Group for Animals, Torrance, California Objective - To evaluate the clinical outcome after extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) in dogs affected by cauda equine syndrome (C ES) and to report our early experience with ESWT. Study Design -Retrospective Review . Animals - 38 dogs and 2 cats diagnosed with CES. Methods - All patients were sedated for ESWT. 1,000 shock waves were delivered over the lumbosacral area, using the probe with a focal pressure depth of 5mm or 20mm, 240 pulses per minute and an energy flux density of 0.14mJ/mm2 or 0.15mJ/mm2. The treatment was repeated in three weeks if the patient regressed on recheck. The patients' responses were evaluated by the authors. The owners were required to complete pre-treatment and post- treatment questionnaires, specific to pain, stiffness, performance, and comfort level of their pets at the respective visits and through a phone survey. Results - The 53 (89.8%) out of 59 animals responded to ESWT on clinician's subjective evaluation. The average owner's satisfaction score regardi ng ESWT was 5.75\u00b11.86 (82.1%) out of 7. Most patients showed significant improveme nt from immediate after to within one week after ESWT. The median durati on of ESWT effect was 13.6months (0-23 months). Five dogs and one cat out of 40 patients (15.6%) received ESWT twice. One dog (2.5%) received three times. Thirty five out of 40 clients (87.5%) would use ESWT again if needed. No adverse treatment-related effects we re observed in any patient. Conclusion- ESWT provides an effective method of reli eving pain associated with CES in dogs and cats. ESWT may replace or enhance the chemical analgesics and delay or eliminate the need for surgical intervention. Clinical Relavance- ESWT can be used to provide non-surg ical treatment for CES in dogs and cats. Introduction Cauda equina syndrome has been well descri bed in both dogs and hum ans (Indrieri 1988; Spector, Madigan et al. 2008). Clin ical signs are associated with physical compression of the cauda equina, which is the termin al part of the spinal cord, and nerve roots caused by lumbo- sacral instability with or wit hout an intervertebral disc hern iation (Ramirez and Thrall 1998). Diagnosis of cauda equina syndrom e is made by integrating the pa tient's history, clinical signs, radiographs, and when possible, advanced diag nostic imaging findings. Cauda equina syndrome is more common in large breed dogs, occurring mo re commonly in male dogs with the German Shepherd Dog being the most commonly affecte d. Cauda equina syndrome has been seen in almost all breeds including et al. 2008). It is also found in small dogs and cats. Common clinical signs include lu mbosacral pain, hyperesthesia with or without hyperpathia over the lower lumbar spinal region, re luctance to sit or jump, pelvic limb lameness, inappetance, personality changes, flaccid tail and sensory and/or motor neural dysfunction causi ng bilateral or unilateral paraparesis with pr ominent muscle atro phy (Sjostrom 2003). In severely affected patients, urinary or fecal incontinence can be observed (Todd 2005; Cari ou, Stork et al. 2008; Spector, Madigan et al. 2008). Lumbosacral (LS) disease can have debilitating ef fects on our canine and o ccasionally our feline patients. When conservative ma nagement fails, dorsal decomp ression has been described to surgically Epidural infiltration with methylpr ednisone acetate has been reported with reasonable success (Janssens, VCOT 2009) However, the current treatment options are often less than satisfactory in alleviating pain and improving quality of life for these patients. ES WT has shown promise in treating the symptoms of LS disease. Extracorporeal shock wave t echnology (ESWT) is a technology that has been used for years in human and equi ne medicine and is more recently making a transition into small animal veterinary medicine. Shock waves are single pulsed acous tic or sonic waves that dissipa te mechanical energy at the interface of substances with di fferent acoustic impedance. While it is somewhat new to small animal veterinary medicine it has a long history of use in equine and human medicine. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (E SWT) has been used for the disintegration of urinary calculi since 1970's (Fuchs & Patel, 1996). Subsequent investigations have evaluated ESWT for the treatment of various musculoskele tal disorders in both humans and Haupt, the tr eatment of plantar fasciitis and lateral epicondylitis for human use and ESWT is of ten the primary treatment of choice for musculotendinous injuries in sporting horses. A shock wave is appr oximately 1000 times the pressure magnitude of an ultrasound wave a nd deposits energy at a controlled focal volume within the body. The mechanic al energy transferred to tissu e following an ESWT treatment causes various biological responses at the cellular level including the regulation of cytokines and growth factors leading to decreased infl ammation, neovascularization and cellular proliferation.(Wang, 2002, 2003 & 2005). ESWT has al so been demonstrated to speed healing and increase quality of healing in soft tissue and bone, protect chrondrocytes, disintegrate calcifications, and recruiting stem cells to Surg Am 2005; Aicher, Cell Circulation 2006). Curre nt canine clinical studies are underway for the treatment of elbow OA and shoulder in juries (Danova, 2003). How ESWT symptomatically improves muscul oskeletal conditions is not yet clearly understood. Antinociceptive effect has been pro posed by blocking activati on of nociceptors in the skin and deep structures that cause pain on activation. Hyperstimula tion analgesia, where overstimulation of nerve fibers re sults an immediate analgesic ef fect, has been also suggested (Rompe JD, et al. J bone Joint Surg Br. 1996; Melzack R. 1975). It was shown that ESWT quickly increase neuronal nitri ox ide synthase (nNOS) activity and ba sal nitric oxide (NO) in the rat glioma cell, which suggested a molecular mechanism of the anti-inflammatory action of ESWT (Ciampa, et al. 2005). Clinically, an immediate vasodilatation was observed and an enhancement of angiogenesis around the ESWT treated area was found (Mariotto, et al. 2005) The purpose of this study was to evaluate ESWT as a non-invasive therapy for cauda equina syndrome in small animals. It wa s hypothesized that ESWT can imp rove the negative behavioral and performance symptoms that often result from th e associated pain of LS disease. Therefore this client survey trial was conducted with the primary objec tive of obtaining feedback and evaluating the potential quality of life improvement following LS disease management with ESWT. The secondary purpose was to evaluate the clients' overall sa tisfaction with ESWT treatments to better evaluate the potential for inco rporating ESWT as the first line treatment for LS disease in a specializ ed surgical practice. Materials and method The medical records of patient s with documented cauda equina syndrome treated with ESWT between March 2008 and February 2010 at Surgical Group for Animals were reviewed. Only cases that had clinical signs and radiographic evidences of caudal equina syndrome were included. The duration of clinical symptoms before ESWT was not accurately known for most cases and so was not used as part of the analysis. All neurological examinations were carried out by the same board certified surgeon, [ EL]. The diagnoses of cauda e quina syndrome were made by demonstrating pain or discomfo rt of the lower spine, and ra diographic changes, such as lumbosacral spondylosis and/or dyna mic angle changes between the 7th lumber vertebra and sacrum. Pain was evaluated by historical attri butes like yelping, scratc hing behavior and /or obvious discomfort or avoidance of being touched over the lower spine together with clinical findings like spinal hyperesthesia or reluctance to jump or st and upright on the rear legs. Extracorporeal shock wave treatment Dogs and cats were sedated with a combina tion of ketamine at 25m atropine at 0.04mg/kg administered ously, or a of medetomidine butorphanol at 0.2mg/kg a nd atropine at 0.04mg/kg. The patients were then treated with the VersaTron 4 Paws (Pulse Veteri nary Technologies, LLC, Alpharetta GA) ESWT device. The lumbosacral area was clipped and cleaned with 70% isopropyl alcohol. Conducting gel was applied and 1,000 shock waves were de livered over the lumbos acral area, using the probe with a focal pressure depth of 5mm or 20mm, 240 pulses per minute and an energy flux density of 0.14mJ/mm2 or 0.15mJ/mm2. All patients were sedated for approximately 5 minutes for ESWT and discharged approximately one hou r after the treatment. Owners were educated on the risks and benefits associated with ESWT incl uding the potential for incr eased pain for up to 3 days following the treatment. The treatment was re peated in three weeks if the patient regressed on recheck. After treatment, the dogs were kept on a controlled leash ex ercise for a week, and then allowed back to normal activity. Cats were kept cage or crate confined for a week before being allowed back into th eir normal enviornment. Clinician's evaluation All treated patients were reevalua ted at one and three weeks afte r ESWT for signs of lameness, pain on palpation of the lumbosacral spine, ex tension of one or both hind limbs and general attitude. Interpretation of these clinical signs was subj ectively evaluated by two clinicians (EBL or YK) and the outcome was recorded as responsive or non-responsive. Client Questionnaire Upon agreeing to the treatment, the clients were required to complete pre-treatment and post- treatment questionnaires specific to pain, stiffness, physical task performance, and comfort level at the respective visits and through a phone survey between March 2008 and February 2010 . For each question, the owners documented their observed signs of the pain on the pet's ability to perform a specific task. The patient s were graded on a 1-7 scale. A score of ' 1' means that the symptoms are most severe and patients are unable to perform specific ta sk while a score of '7' means that no symptoms exist and patien ts are completely normal and healthy. In addition, owners were asked a bout general impressions of the s hock wave treatment, such as how long until the client saw an effect, how l ong the effect lasted, their opinion of ESWT compared to other trea tments, overall satisfaction with ESWT and their willingness to use the treatment again under simil ar circumstances. Data analysis The pre-treatment data was compared to the data from the final visit or p hone survey. If either the before or after question was not answered by the owner, the patient was not included in the calculation for that specific answer but was incl uded in calculations for all other answers for which a before and after observation was comple ted. In order to compare differences between before and after treatment, an ANOVA Single Factor analysis was used. Data were considered significant at p < 0.05. Results Clinician's subject ive evaluation One thirty five small animals were treated with ESWT from March 2008 to October 2010. These included patients treated at multiple treatment sites or had surgery in conjunction with ESWT. All patients treated at multiple sites or in conjunction with a su rgical procedure [i.e. TPLO] were eliminated from the study. Thirty eight dogs and two cats were included in this study. The Labrador Retrievers were predominan tly presented breed (7?), followed by German Shepherd Dogs (2?) and their mix (4?), Golden Re trievers (3?), Pit Bull Terriers (2?). The mean age was 3.6 \u00b1 3.59 years (range 1.4-13years) and the mean weight was 33.2\u00b116.6 kg (5.1- 78.1kg). The feline group included a 12 year old spayed female and a 1 year old neutered male, who weighed 6.5kg and 4.4kg, respectively. Both cat s were Russian Blue. Th irty four dogs and 2 cats out of 40 (90%) patients that were trea ted with ESWT improved on clinician's subjective evaluation at recheck visits. Five dogs did not show noticeable improvement. One dog became worse than before ESWT (Fig. 1). No adverse treatment-related effects were observed in any patient. Figure 1.

Only one dog became worse ESWT. Client Questionnaire One hundred small animals were treated with ESWT from Mar. 2008 to Feb. 2010. Thirty eight dogs and two cats were included in the survey. The canine group consisted of twenty two neutered males, three intact ma les, and ten spayed females. The Labrador Retrievers were predominantly presented breed (7 ), followed by German Shepherd Dog (2) and mix (4), Golden Retrievers (3), Pit Bull Terrier (2). The mean age was 3.6 \u00b1 3.59 years (range 1.4-13years) and the mean weight was 33.2\u00b116.6 kg (5.1-78.1kg).

Both cats were Russian Blue. Most patients showed improveme nt from immediate after to w ithin one week after ESWT. The median duration of ESWT effect was 13.6months (0 -23 months). Five dogs and one cat out of 40 patients (15.6%) received ESWT twice. One dog (2.5%) received three times. Prior to treatment, the most pr oblematic symptoms reported by owners were that their animals showed a high degree of aversion to getting up and down from sitting or lying positions, not wanting to play, reluctance to climb stairs, exhi biting morning stiffness, reluctance to jump up and down and in general seeming unhappy and unc omfortable. Fig 1. provides average ratings for the degree of symptoms reported by owners of the 40 patients (1 = ab normal - unable to perform the deligated tasks and 7 = completely normal). Figure 2.

Owners reported the greatest improvement in getting up and down, in which post treatment score was 2 points higher. At the time of the follow-up survey, 28 out of 40 patients (70%) were still seeing sustained improvement. Follo wing treatment, owners reported that their animals were significantly more comfortable (p<0.001). Thirty out of 35 (86%) of owners who responded to the question regardi ng duration of ESWT reported re sults lasting gr eater than 3 months. Twenty eight of 35 (80%) were reporte d lasting greater than 6 months (Fig. 3). Figure 3. Duration of ESWT effect. In 86% of pa tients, owners reported ESWT effects lasting longer than 3 months. 80% of patients la sted longer than 6 months per owners. Of the 36 clients who responded as to how they would grade the success of the shock wave treatment in comparison to other treatment moda lities, 29 (81%) reported ESWT to be better than other treatments , 3 (8%) reported the results to be the sa me. 4 (11%) reported ESWT to be less successful than other forms of treatment including NSAIDs and acupuncture (Fig. 4) < 1 mo 8%1 ~ 3 mos. 6% > 3mos. 6%> 6mos. 80%Duration of ESWT effect Fig. Owner's perception of success of ESWT in comp arison to other treatment modalities. 80.6% of owners reported ESWT to be better. 3% reported the results to be same, and 11% reported ESWT to be less successful than other treatments. Of the 40 respondents, the average satisfaction score regarding ESWT was 5.75\u00b11.86 (82.1%). Thirty five out of 40 clients (87.5%) would use ESWT again if needed. Discussion CES is a common problem without a simple standard medical treatment. For patients who are experiencing enough pain to affect their quality of life but who are not e xperiencing neurological symptoms, the risk and cost of surgery may out weigh the benefits. A non-invasive approach to alleviating the pain and decrea sed fuction associated with CES was needed for this patient population. The epidural infiltration of anti -inflammatory drugs has been used in human as a first treatment choice rather than a surgery w ith varying success rates between 50 and 90% (Postacchini, 1996). The use of epidural infiltration in dogs with lumb osacral degenerative sten osis is a safe and well accepted treatment that seems to achieve clinical results comparable to those of decompressive Better 80.6%Same 8.3% Worse 11.1%ESWT vs. Other Treatmentssurgery (Janssens, 2009). However, the procedure re quires skilled surgical techniques and also a fluoroscopy, which is not readily available to general practice. Previous studies have demonstr ated that ESWT causes a biol ogical response in the body and stimulates repair at the cellular level in addition to decreasing inflammation, suggesting that the technology would be bene ficial in treating CES. Studies have shown that degenerative disc disease involves high levels of TNF-alpha and IL-10.(Holms, Ve t Pathol. 2009) ESWT has been demonstrated to reduce levels of TNF alpha and IL-10 (Moretti, 2008). The safety profile of the tec hnology also makes it appealing. Wh en used correctly with the proper diagnosis, side effects are minimal to none (Gerdesmeyer, 2003; Schaden, 2001). The technology has been approved by the FDA for human us e and is safely used in equine medicine to treat various back conditions including spondylo sis, osteoarthritis, a nd dorsal spinous process morphologically and microscopically insignificant neuronal loss in comparison to the control gr oup when 2000 impulses were delivered at low dose (0.18mJ/mm2) shockwave energy level, which is higher than the treatment protocol (0.14mJ/mm2 or 0/15mJ/mm2) of this study and were applied directly to the spinal cord at a laminectomy (Lee, 2007). In this study, 51 dogs and 2 cats out of 59 (89.8 %) patients that were treated with ESWT improved on clinician's subjective evaluation. No side effect rela ted to ESWT was reported in any patient during the treatment of 59 cases. Dura tion of ESWT was long lasting in most cases. The effect of ESWT lasted l onger than 60 months in 80% of treated animals. Compared to traditional medical management, 81% of owners in this stu dy reported ESWT to be better without side effects. Only one dog did not improve and gradually got worse after ESWT was performed. From the initial trials, it was noticed that patients who ha d already developed neur ologic deficits did not respond to ESWT, and no patients who showed neur ologic deficits were included in this study. The dog that gradually became worse may have alre ady developed some neurologic deficits even though it was not obvious. Investigational use of ESWT for treatment of CES proved to be beneficial. ESWT proved to be effective in relieving pain and performance challenges associated with lumbosacral diseases and restrictions on mobility. Signifi cant differences in before an d after ESWT were observed on clinician's evaluation and owner's perception, which reported significant improvements. The cost of this treatment was signifi cantly lower than associated cost s of surgery and recovery. With 87.5% of the clients reporting that they would use the treatment agai n, it can be stated that they were satisfied with the results. Client satisfac tion with not only the re sults but the perceived value of the treatment modality is extrem ely important to prac tice sustainability. Advanced diagnostic imaging would have been very useful to make definitive diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome (Ramirez and Thrall, 1998). Howe ver, the availability and cost of these modalities limited their use for our clinical cases. Advanced im aging, such as MRI, followed by kinetic and kinematic gait analyses would have provided objective data, but it was not possible in this clinical setting. Due to the retrospective nature of the study and the subtleness of the disease, owner assessment was deemed to be most appropriate and useful. Owner questionnaires have been combined with clinician's observation for evaluating the effectiveness of ESWT. While clinicain's observation and owner perceptions were highly subjective, they allowed preliminary conclusion to be drawn on the usefulness of ESWT. Obviously, further documentation wa s needed to objectively assess its positive effects on animals in pain and discomfort. In summary, this retrospective study provides positive outcome to support the use of ESWT for treating CES. Conclusion It is recommended that ESWT be considered as a first-line treatment option for moderate, non- neurological LS disease. Client reported improvement, in some cases significant improvement, in various behavioral and performan ce related symptoms of LS disease following treatment with focused ESWT. In addition, th e clients questioned for the pu rpose of this study reported extremely high rates of satisfaction with the treatment outcomes. References Aicher A et al.
