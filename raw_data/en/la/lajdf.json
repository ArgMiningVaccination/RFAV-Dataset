But new research shows a link between the vaccine and Autism Spectrum Disorders. Learn more about vaccines and how they can affect your health. Talk about an alarming health trend! A new government study released in October indicates about 1 in 100 children have autism spectrum disorders. This is a rapid rise. - A separate study conducted by the Center for Disease Control also found the same autism rate, [which is higher than their previous U.S. estimate of 1 in 150 children with autism](https://bodyecology.com/articles/autism_epidemic.php/). - The 2007 survey results from the National Survey of Children's Health reveals a 100% increase in parent-reported [autism spectrum disorders](https://bodyecology.com/autism.php), compared to the 2003 results.[i] - Although some federal health officials speculate that greater awareness accounts for the results, Dr. Thomas Insel, the director of the National Institute of Mental Health, says, \"The concern here is that buried in these numbers is a true increase.\"[ii] Could there be a link between autism rates and childhood vaccinations? For years, [the link between vaccines and autism has been debated and contested](https://bodyecology.com/08/05/22/vaccines_dont_cause_autism.php). Some medical professionals assert that correlation isn't the same as causation, especially for MMR shots. But considering that current the US childhood immunization schedule calls for 28 injections with 11 different vaccines before the age of two, it's still impossible to know - conclusively - exactly if and how childhood vaccination is associated with an increased risk for autism spectrum disorders. Now, a new study published in the September 2009 issue of Annals of Epidemiology shows that giving [ Hepatitis B vaccine](/articles/understanding-total-load-patricia-lemer.php) to newborn baby boys may triple the risk of developing an autism spectrum disorder.[iii] To be sure, this doesn't imply that the Hepatitis B vaccine causes an autism spectrum disorder, per se. But this study (along with others that are soon to be released) may show a link to the rapid increase, and support a hypothesized causal association between the Hepatitis B vaccine and ASD, at least in boys.
