There are opportunities in Bendigo, Ballarat and Cairns, with a growing demand for this field. While its name might evoke images of doctors tending to pro athletes during sporting matches, that's just one part of this field which broadens out to musculo-skeletal medicine. Dr James Ooi posts preventative health tips on Instagram [here](https://www.instagram.com/the.movement.doctor). [ Regional cardiology ](#Regional_cardiology-6) The importance of local Cardiologists is steadily growing as our population ages.

With new appointments, dedicated cancer centres and new resources, it has become easier than ever to treat cancer patients within their own communities. In this episode Oncologists from regional Victoria talk about the role they play in treating their patients close to home. [ What are the Regional Training Hubs? ](#What_are_the_Regional_Training_Hubs-11) Training for junior doctors in metropolitan cities is often done through well defined, well traveled pathways with a history that sometimes stretches back decades. Out in the regions, pathways are newer. Some are still being built right now, and all of them are expanding to incorporate more regional rotations and placements. This is where the Regional Training Hubs come in. Their role is to build on the rural training network established through the Rural Health Multidisciplinary Training program. Then, as rural medical pathways develop and grow, the hubs help coordinate different stages of medical training to enable students intending to practice regionally to complete as much of their medical training as possible within regional and rural areas. [ Medical administration ](#Medical_administration-12) Ever wondered how to get into Medical Administration? Pathways in this space are less defined than some specialisations, but there are no shortage of administrative opportunities out there in regional Australia. Managing a health service is a lot like any large organisation - it takes expertise and committed people to keep everything running as smoothly as possible. Medical Administrators come from all areas of healthcare and management, as well as every stage of career. Some doctors get into administration after decades of clinical work, and others seek it out from the beginning. In this episode of Doctor What? Doctor Where? You'll hear from a wide range of perspectives training and working as Medical Administrators. [ Regional medical research ](#Regional_medical_research-13) Medical research drives healthcare delivery.

Research can also be essential in some career pathways. and there are lots of opportunities in rural areas. Whether you plan to take on a research project alongside practicing, or you're thinking of a research centred career, there's something for everyone. [ Paediatrics in the regions ](#Paediatrics_in_the_regions-14) Regional Paediatricians form a vital network of doctors providing local care to kids all around Victoria. When a child in regional Victoria falls ill, the whole family is affected. Parents have to take time off work, other family members might have to take care of siblings, and in more serious cases, a lengthy trip to Melbourne is needed to seek more sub-specialised treatment at the Royal Children's, or Monash Children's Centre. Opportunities from trainees to consultants across country areas are opening up as demand for rural Paediatricians grow. The rich lifestyle, career mobility and community spirit all come together to provide a fulfilling life in the regions. [ Rural intensive care ](#Rural_intensive_care-15) Intensive Care Units are growing in regional areas and along with them, training and career opportunities. When patients need weeks of inpatient care, providing it close to home is the best scenario. In this episode you'll hear from doctors in Bendigo's ICU, which has expanded its capabilities alongside the redevelopment of their hospital, turning it into a key service in regional Intensive Care medicine. [ Emergency medicine ](#Emergency_medicine-1) Emergency departments are the first port of call for seriously ill patients. This creates a fast paced, dynamic and varied job for doctors working in the ED. For the most part, these patients will just go to their nearest hospital with an Emergency Department. This means the only differences between an emergency department at a metropolitan hospital and a rural health service are their size and capability. For an Emergency doctor, we can find some differences in the variety of the work they do, and the lifestyle which regional living offers. [ Rural anaesthetics ](#Rural_anaesthetics-2) Anaesthesia is an essential part of patient care and plays a critical role in rural medicine.

[ Rural psychiatry ](#Rural_psychiatry-4) Psychiatry training used to be the domain of large tertiary hospitals and clinical schools in capital cities, now it is a specialty that can be entirely completed outside metropolitan centres. In this episode you'll hear about the wide range of opportunities for Psychiatry in regional Australia from Psychiatrists practicing in this field. [ Advanced skills GP/rural generalist ](#Advanced_skills_GP_rural_generalist-5) General Medical practise is the cornerstone of medicine in Australia. Advanced Skills GPs, or Rural Generalists, learn an additional sub-specialty on top of general medicine which helps complement their skills in a regional setting where the healthcare needs might not be great enough to require a standalone specialist.
