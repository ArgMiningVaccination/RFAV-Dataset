Naturopaths are trained in many natural health disciplines to become experts in holistic healthcare, enabling them to assist their clients from many different perspectives, selecting the optimum natural healthcare treatment plan. This course provides an in- depth study of Eastern medicine and Naturopathy. It is the only programme, to our knowledge, that combines the four main Eastern medicines and Naturopathy disciplines in one programme. The one-year course is written as a continual course and can be taken as a whole, or you can cherry-pick individual units. Naturopathy is a blend of many different disciplines that were passed down through the ages. It has its roots in Eastern medicine and herbal lore and nature cure methods have been added over the ages. Knowledge of naturopathic philosophy will help you understand your client's symptoms, enabling you to unravel how they arrived at them. Not only does this help alleviate the symptoms but it also puts the client back in control of their health. This is the role of the naturopath as 'Docere' or teacher. This course is written in line with the National Occupational Standards (NOS) for the practice of Naturopathy. Naturopathy Course Units: 1: Ayurveda Medicine [2: Chinese Medicine 1: Ayurveda Medicine The many naturopathic techniques and its philosophy are not considered 'scientific' and therefore much of this ancient wisdom is being dropped from modern courses or, at best, only receives a cursory mention. The result is confusion about what true naturopathic philosophy can teach us as practitioners. It also leads to its teachings being misunderstood and therefore not practiced effectively. This course seeks to address the lack of naturopathic teaching and also the lack of connections that are made between different symptoms. The body never acts against us and it has the capacity to rebalance itself under the right circumstances. The art of the naturopath is to make sense of the symptoms and to reassure the client that balance can be restored. In our current environment we suffer many stresses, both emotional and environmental (to name but two) and these stresses immediately impact the body, causing dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. This is the beginning of symptoms, which are at first so subtle as not to be noticed. Once symptoms become apparent there are usually a few bodily systems involved. Unless we understand the initial cause we can only hope, at best, to palliate symptoms. Mary Sharma, the course author, says, \"Having trained in various disciplines over the years of being a practitioner and seeing how they all enhanced my understanding of health and disease I decided to write a course that I would have loved to have done 25 years ago, when I was first starting out on my alternative medical training. The course starts with Eastern medicine and provides a detailed study of Ayurveda, Chinese five elements, Tibetan Medicine and Unani (Greek/Persian) medicine. Once you have this grounding you then study homeopathic philosophy which underpins naturopathic philosophy. By the time you reach the naturopathic module you will find that the philosophy is second nature to you. The rest of the course builds on this foundation and covers iridology, hydrotherapy, an introduction to homotoxicology, psychology and psychosocial skills and finishes with a detailed module about dentistry and health. I have added this last module because I believe it is of the utmost importance for practitioners to understand the effects of dentistry and oral health upon the overall health of the body\".
