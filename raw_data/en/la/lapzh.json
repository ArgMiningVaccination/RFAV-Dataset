Flu and autism Did anyone have flu during pregnancy? My son is autistic and I keep going thru the anxiety of why and was it because of sickness?

It def wasn't the flu however It could have been an underactive thyroid (hyperthyrodism) or a deficiency in iodine while pregnant. Underactive thyroid is called hypothyroidism autism is genetic. being sick with the flu would not cause autism. its all about genes, the autism would have been there regardless of what you did or didnt do in pregnancy nopez boy and girl. had a couple colds with one of them, no issues with the other. like i said, many drs experienced in autism told me its genetics, nothing id do would cause it. its not caused by anything but genetics are they both the same sex or different sex? Did you have flu with them? i have 2 kids with autism, the drs all said nothing i did or got sick with would cause autism, so no getting a flu would not cause autism to occur genetic means gene interactions. So a flu or sickness could bring on a genetic interaction which causes autism to occur or for the brain to develop a certain way. Autism is multi factorial. Autism could be genetic or acquired (regressive autism) which happens around 18 months. My son's was regressive. Turns out he has hypothyodism and the MTHFR gene which means he has a hard time detoxing and so these kind of kids don't do well with vaccinations, envoirmental toxins, chemicals etc. We also live in a big city.. His doctor put him on a detox diet and thyroid medication and hes doing so much better already. If it's genetic, u'll see signs way earlier then 18 months. No 2 kids have Autism for the same reason. It's essentially a \"perfect storm\" of issues whether medical or otherwise that caused it. Research is still ongoing but diff doctors have diff opinions. My son is seeing a holistic doctor to treat his gut as he also has gut issues (allergies) So that, thyroid and MTHFR created his. He was also defecient in some vitamins. This is all I know so far. I suggest going to diff doctors to find out the underlying reasons whether it be neurologists, holistic, endocrinologists etc and start a treatment plan. Most important a good healthy diet is crucial - no junk food or chips but lots of brain food like almonds, pecans, eggs, fish etc. Autism is partly genetic, but there, are some factors they considering having an effect. Hypothyroidism is one of them and low iodid intake. Further I read that taking Tylenol often during the pregnancy might be a factor and having low iron levels / anemia during pregnancy. Autism is Genetic. I'm Autistic and ADHD .There is nothing wrong with being Autistic!! Everyone also doesn't need therapy for Autism. I found out that I was autistic at 21 years old which was a huge relief, I took my mask off and never want to be classified as A Neurotypical again. My point is Don't use ABA to change your kids, tell them they're Autistic!! Don't force them into social situations it hurts them horribly, love them , meet their sensory needs , and don't try to force them to be normal !
