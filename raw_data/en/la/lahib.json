Based on their specific symptoms, a homeopath will match the most appropriate dilution for each patient. Homeopathic medicines were recognized as drugs in 1938 and regulated by the FDA for the processes of manufacturing and distribution. What is Homeopathic Medicine? Homeopathy is based on the principle that is, a substance that causes symptoms when taken in large doses, can be used in small amounts to treat those same symptoms. For example: Drinking too much coffee can cause sleeplessness and agitation, so according to this principle, when made into a homeopathic medicine, it could be used to treat people with these symptoms. This concept is sometimes used in conventional medicine. For example; The stimulant Ritalin is used to treat patients with ADHD. Or small doses of allergens such as pollen are sometimes used to desensitize allergic patients. However, one major difference with homeopathic medicines is that substances are used in ultra-high dilutions, which makes most of them non-toxic. Homeopathic medicines (which homeopaths call remedies) are prepared by specialist pharmacies using a careful process of dilution and succession (a specific form of vigorous shaking). Although some of these medicines can be found over the counter there are some that require prescriptions from a doctor or physician. How are Our Broward County Homeopathic Remedies Made?
