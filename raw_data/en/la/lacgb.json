Weiss, MD, Meghan Brett, MD, Amy A. Ernst, MD Abstract Background: More than 10% of the population visit emergency departments (ED) every year. Many of these patients are not up-to-date on routine vaccinations that could prevent future illnesses. The ED couldsignicantly impact these vaccination trends. Objectives: This study was a feasibility study to determine whether patients would be amenable to an ED- based program that provided appropriate immunizations when they were at high risk for these diseases. In addition, the authors sought to identify barriers that predict high-risk patients who did not receive immu-nizations before ED presentation and to identify barriers that predict those high-risk unvaccinated patientswho are unwilling to receive vaccinations when offered in the ED. Methods: This study was a prospective cross-sectional study of all patients arriving in the ED at one inner- city trauma center between 10 AMand 10 PMover the course of a three-week intervention period. The sub- jects completed a survey that included information about their risk of influenza (flu) and pneumococcaldisease, their immunization history, and their perceptions of their need for immunization. Demographic in-formation collected included insurance status, age, gender, and primary language. All high-risk patients who were not current with their immunizations were offered vaccination. The primary outcome was im- provement in vaccination coverage based on an ED surveillance and treatment system for vaccinations.The secondary outcomes were barriers to successful vaccination before ED presentation and barriers to acceptance of vaccination in the ED. Results were compared using chi-square test and condence interval analysis. Characteristics of barriers to immunization were determined using a logistic regression model.A p-value <0.05 was considered signicant. Results: A total of 674 subjects were entered into the study. Vaccination of subjects at high risk for flu in- creased signicantly from 16% before to 83% after ED evaluation and treatment, and vaccination of sub- jects at high risk for pneumococcal disease increased signicantly from 18% before to 84% after ED evaluation and treatment. Signicant barriers to vaccination before ED presentation were lack of insurance(odds ratio [OR] = 0.31 for flu, 0.22 for pneumococcal disease), age younger than 50 years (OR = 0.18 for flu,0.24 for pneumococcal disease), and no perceived need for vaccination (OR = 0.07 for flu). The sole signif- icant barrier to vaccine administration in the ED was perceived need for vaccination (OR = 0.32 for flu). Conclusions: An ED-based vaccination program is both feasible and successful. Other than a shortage of vaccine, the only ED barrier to vaccination (perceived need) might be overcome with patient education. ACADEMIC EMERGENCY MEDICINE 2006; 13:922-930 \u00aa2006 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine Keywords: influenza, pneumococcus, vaccination, preventive care There are now more than 100 million emergency department (ED) visits in the United States per year. More than 10% of Americans visit an ED an-nually, and many preferentially visit EDs rather than tra- ditional primary care providers.1Studies have shown that vaccination in the ED is a cost-effective way to From the Department of Emergency Medicine, University of New Mexico (DR, SJW, MB, AAE), Albuquerque, NM.

The primary hypothesis was that patients would be amenable to an ED-based program that provided appropriate immunizationswhen they were at high risk for these diseases. The sec- ondary hypotheses were 1) that we could identify bar- riers that predict those high-risk patients who had notreceived immunizations before presentation in the EDand 2) that we could identify barriers that predict those high-risk unvaccinated patients unwilling to receive vac- cinations in the ED when offered. METHODS Study Design This was a prospective cross-sectional study of patients presenting to the ED at an inner-city Level 1 trauma cen-ter. The institutional review board approved the study. Study Setting and Population Subjects represented a consecutive sampling of patients during the study period. The hospital census is >60,000adult ED patient visits per year. Study Protocol The study was conducted seven days a week over the three-week period in 2003 between December 1 and De-cember 21. The program was implemented during the hours of 10 AMto 10 PM, which, based on historical data, represented 70% of all patients arriving at thedoor. The times were split into three 4-hour time blocks and covered by trained bilingual student interviewers. Overall, 100% of the time blocks were covered. Intervention. All subjects older than 18 years were iden- tied at our triage booth. They were each asked whether they were interested in participating in a study aboutvaccination. Each subject was asked by a bilingual study associate which language (English or Spanish) he or she would prefer for taking the written survey (the Englishversion of the survey is available as a Data Supplement athttp://www.aemj.org/cgi/content/full/j.aem.2006.04.022/ DC1). The Spanish-language survey was translated from English by a bilingual member of our staff. It was thenpresented to two other members of our staff who spoke the local dialect of Spanish to ensure that the meaning was comparable in both languages. For study purposes,language spoken as a variable was based on whether the subject chose to complete the questionnaire inEnglish or Spanish. Although we are not aware of any- one who consented and was missed, it is possible thatthis could have occurred if the subject was called into the ED too quickly. The surveys were presented to the subjects by medical students trained in proper interview technique, knowl- edge about flu and pneumococcal diseases and vaccines, and giving vaccinations. They were instructed in how toapproach subjects in both English and Spanish. The sub-jects then read and completed the written survey that included information about their risk for flu and pneumo- coccal disease, their immunization history, and their per-ceptions of their need for immunization. We checked the medical history through our computerized charting sys- tem for all subjects who were unsure about their immu-nization status. Demographic information was collected on all subjects, including insurance status, age, and gen- der. Data entry was completed by one individual andthen rechecked by a second investigator. Risk Assessment. Flu risk assessment was based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) high-risk guidelines. 11-15For flu, the high-risk group was dened as age older than 50 years, having a high-risk medical disease, or proximity reasons. High-risk medicaldiseases for flu included diabetes, lung disease, heart or kidney disease, sickle cell disease, cancer, human immu- nodeciency virus or acquired immunodeciency syn-drome, corticosteroid use, or pregnancy during flu season. Proximity reasons to be considered high risk in- cluded living with someone older than 65 years or some-one who has one of the high-risk medical diseases, living with a child younger than 2 years, being a health care worker, or providing essential community services. High-risk criteria for pneumococcal disease were also based on CDC guidelines. 15For pneumococcal disease, high risk was dened to include age older than 65 years, being a Native American or Alaskan Native, and/or hav-ing a high-risk medical disease. The high-risk medical diseases related to pneumococcal disease included diabe- tes; lung disease; heart, kidney, disease; alcohol-ism; fluid leak; or corticosteroid use. Subjects who were identied as high risk for either dis- ease were offered the appropriate vaccination. Accep- tance and refusals were documented. Low-risk patients were not offered vaccination due to the shortage ofvaccine. Data Analysis Surveyors entered patient data on a standardized data information collection sheet. Descriptive analysis was completed using standard parametric and nonparametricmethods. Two-way contingency analysis was completed using chi-square and Spearman correlation coefcients for two subgroups. The rst subgroup was all high-risksubjects. The comparison was made between those inthis group who were up-to-date and those who were not up-to-date (comparison 1). The second subgroup was all high-risk subjects who were not up-to-date. Thecomparison was made between those who were offered and were not administered vaccination in the ED andACAD EMERG MED /C15September 2006, Vol. 13, No. 9 /C15www.aemj.org 923those who were administered vaccination (comparison 2). Separate logistic regression models were used toidentify potential barriers associated with being up-to- date for vaccination on presentation to the ED and for receiving a vaccination in the ED. Missing values wereremoved because of the low numbers. The logistic model was based on the smallest comparison subgroup, thus allowing ve variables in the model. A univariate p-value<0.1 for either comparison qualied the variable forinclusion in the maximum model. The maximum model was formally assessed for the presence of multicollinear- ity using a regression eigenanalysis, with a conditionnumber R30 indicative of moderate to severe colinearity as described elsewhere. 16All data analysis was com- pleted using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) forWindows (Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA). RESULTS A total of 674 patients were enrolled in the study. For the flu vaccine data analysis, 26 cases were excluded formissing values. For the pneumococcal vaccine data anal- ysis, 18 cases were excluded for missing values. Of the 648 subjects included for flu vaccine evaluation, 447 pa-tients (69%) were at high risk for flu. Of the 656 subjects included for pneumococcal vaccine evaluation, 295 (45%) were at high risk for pneumococcal disease.Seventy-three of the 447 subjects at high risk for flu (16%) were up-to-date at entry into the study. At comple-tion of the program, an additional 296 were administered flu vaccine so that a total of 369 of the 447 high-risk sub- jects (83%) were [CI] = 61% to 71%). Fifty-four of the 295 subjects at high risk for pneumococcal disease (18%) were up-to-date at entry into the study. At comple-tion of the program, an additional 194 subjects wereadministered pneumococcal vaccine so that a total of 248 of the 295 high-risk subjects for pneumococcal disease (84%) were vaccinated (difference, 66%; 95% CI = 60%to 72%). Figures 1 (flu) and 2 (pneumococcal disease) show the exact breakdown of all patients in the study. Table 1 shows the demographics of the subjects en- tered into the study. Results for the 674 subjects are presented for insurance status, age, gender, languages spoken, and perceived need for vaccination. A large por-tion of our population is uninsured (44%). Although 44% of subjects spoke Spanish, only 88 (13%) completed the survey in Spanish and were considered for the purposeof our study to use Spanish as their primary language.The general population reported a higher perceived need for flu vaccination than for pneumococcal vaccine. Flu vaccine was considered essential by 76% ( n= 512) of the subjects. Of those who thought they should get a flu vaccine, 357 (70%) were correct, based on being at Figure 1. Data subjects in study showing the comparison groups for flu vaccination.924 Rimple et al. /C15ED-BASED VACCINATION PROGRAMhigh risk for the flu. Seventy-eight (21%) of the high-risk subjects for flu did not get flu vaccine. Of these, nine said they would get a vaccine later, 18 were given informationabout flu vaccination, and 14 said they would not get a flu vaccination either now or later. The remainder (37) were not vaccinated because of conditions that might be con-sidered contraindications to vaccination or diseasesthat precluded vaccination. Pneumococcal vaccine was considered essential by 41% ( n= 274) of the subjects. Of those who thought they should get a pneumococcal vaccine, 154 (56%) were cor- rect, based on being at high risk for pneumococcal dis- ease. Forty-seven high-risk subjects for pneumococcaldisease (20%) did not receive pneumococcal vaccine. Of these, ten said they would get a pneumococcal vaccina- tion later, 12 accepted information about pneumococcalvaccine, and four said they would not get a pneumococcal vaccination either now or later. The remainder (21) were not vaccinated because of conditions that might be con-sidered contraindications to vaccination or diseases thatprecluded vaccination. Missing values were removed from further analysis be- cause these numbers were very small. Sixteen patientshad no gender recorded, and ve had no age recorded; all values were present for insurance status and need Figure 2.

In addition, the flu group was missing three values for whether or not the subject was up-to- date, and there were ten values for risk information miss- ing. This led to 26 total subjects (3.9%) being removedfor analysis of flu vaccine barriers and 18 (2.7%) being removed for analysis of pneumococcal vaccine barriers (see Figures 1 and 2 ). Figures 1 and 2 show the subjects who were included in the logistic analysis for flu vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine barrier analysis, respectively. Model 1 lookedat high-risk subjects and compared those who were up-to-date with those who were not up-to-date (see com- parison 1 in Figures 1 and 2 ). Model 2 looked at those high-risk unvaccinated subjects who were offered vacci-nations and compared those who received vaccine with those who did not receive vaccine (see comparison 2 in Figures 1 and 2 ). Tables 2 and 3 represent bivariable analyses of the variables considered for regression modeling.

Barriers to vaccination before presenting to the ED program for both flu and pneumococcal vaccines wereno insurance, age younger than 50 years, and a lack ofperceived need for vaccination. After being included in the ED program, we found that the only barrier to obtaining vaccine (in the absence of a shortage of vac-cine) was that those who perceived they did not requirea flu vaccine were signicantly less likely to receive a vac- cination in the ED setting. DISCUSSION Vaccination can be a low-cost, cost-effective, single- event, and minimal-risk intervention that would poten-tially reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with a number of vaccine-preventable diseases in the populations that are vulnerable and hard to reach in tra-ditional primary care settings. A recent study from Aus- tralia suggests that a hospital-based vaccination program may be more effective than one based in primary care. 17 The expert committee of the Society for Academic Emer-gency Medicine included only pneumococcal vaccination of patients aged 65 years and older in their list of pre- ventive services that could be delivered in the ED andrecommended that such a program be administered when resources were available. 8An American CollegeTable 4 Flu Vaccination Logistic Regression Models Comparison 1 Comparison 2 Adjusted Odds Ratio 95% CI p-value Adjusted Odds Ratio 95% CI p-value Insured 0.13 Yes Ref RefNo 0.63 0.66 0.39, 1.12 Age (yr) <0.01 0.58 Older than 0.55 Perceived need <0.01 Yes Ref Ref No 0.07 0.02, 0.30 0.32 0.19, 0.55 Comparison 1 is up-to-date high-risk subjects ( n= 73) vs. not up-to-date high-risk subjects ( n= 374).

See Figure 2 for further explanation of subject inclusion.ACAD EMERG MED /C15September 2006, Vol. 13, No. 9 /C15www.aemj.org 927of Emergency Physicians policy statement recommends that ED personnel should consider providing routine im-munizations if other sources are not readily available. 18 We found that, before ED presentation, barriers to vac- cination included lack of insurance, younger age, and lackof perceived need for vaccination. In our program, we were able to overcome all of these except for perceived need. This suggests that more focused ED educationalmaterial could overcome this nal barrier as well. Pneumococcal vaccination in EDs may be a cost-bene- cial way to prevent subsequent hospitalization for inva- sive pneumococcal disease. 2-5Influenza vaccination may lead to similar reductions, although the cost and benets have not been studied.3,4,6,19,20These two vaccines, along with the tetanus booster, have the benet of conferringtheir immunity after a single dose, as opposed to the hep- atitis and many childhood vaccinations, which require a series of shots. As overcrowding increases the ED length of stay for patients, patients have more waiting time available in the ED that may be used for other purposes. Only halfof ED visits are for urgent or emergent care, and theaverage time spent in the ED is three hours; therefore, there is ample opportunity to provide preventive health interventions to people who seek care in EDs. Thirteenpercent of adults in the United States do not have a reg- ular source of primary care and are signicantly less likely to have previously received recommended immuni-zations. 19While only about 1% report that EDs are their usual source of care, studies show that a much larger proportion rely on EDs for care.19,21-23Disparities in im- munization coverage are known to exist in the under- insured or uninsured and in racial and ethnic groups. These patients are also more likely to be seen in the ED. We were not limited by cost, because the interviewers were volunteer medical students. Cost is often a barrier to a successful program. Although a comprehensive in- vestigation of the costs and savings of ED vaccinationhas not been conducted, a number of studies strongly suggest that vaccination would be cost-saving. 24Slobod- kin et al. estimated that influenza immunization providedin the ED would reduce hospitalizations by 1,000 pa- tients, prevent 300 premature deaths, and save $225 mil- lion. They also estimated that ED vaccination of patientsagainst pneumococcal disease would prevent 4,000 pre-mature deaths and save $2 billion. 3 One other study looked at the feasibility of vaccinations in the ED. In the study, patients were vaccinated in a Ca-nadian ED over a four-week period. 25They looked earlier in the season, before patients were brought up-to date by their primary providers. Our study was performed afterwe would expect all likely subjects to have been vacci- nated. Unlike our study, 35% of patients presenting to the ED in the Canadian study were up-to-date on flu vac-cine and 38% were up-to-date on pneumococcal vaccine. This was almost double the background level of vaccina- tions that we saw in our study. At the end of their study,70% of the study population was vaccinated for flucompared with 83% in our study, and 76% of the study population was vaccinated for pneumococcal disease compared with 84% in our study. Signicantly fewer ofour patients were initially vaccinated and signicantly more were vaccinated at the end of the study. This is astriking difference between the programs. We attribute these differences to a poorer preventive health systemin general and to our use of dedicated medical students as surveyors. While language is often a barrier, it was not the case in our study. All patients presenting to our ED speak English, Spanish, or both. All of our interviewers were bilingual, thus decreasing the possibility that the Span-ish-speaking population would be uncomfortable or leftout of the study population. A unique aspect of this study was the participation of a reasonably large number of Native Americans. NativeAmericans are automatically at high risk for pneumo- coccal disease based on CDC recommendations. They represented 82 of the 295 patients at high risk for pneu-mococcal disease, or almost 30%. The Native Americans were far more likely to have been vaccinated against flu than all other groups, the only signicant difference forthem. A number of other barriers have been considered in regard to an ED immunization program. These includelack of staff time in the ED for vaccination and assess-ment, insufcient ED funding for vaccines, and lack of availability of the vaccines. These barriers ultimately lead to a lack of sustainability of programs to providethese needed preventive care interventions. The use of well-trained medical students in academic centers could help overcome these barriers. LIMITATIONS This study covered only a three-week period during the fall and winter season. It was timed to occur after most people who were going to get vaccinated would havehad their vaccinations completed. It is possible that ifthe study period were either earlier or later in the season, the flu vaccine numbers might have changed dramati- cally. The study did not address the needs of low-risk pa-tients, because the supply of vaccine only permitted the study of high-risk patients at this time. We also did not check the accuracy of self-reported vaccination but onlychecked on status when the patient was unsure. This is consistent with the results of Macdonald et al., who noted self-report to have a sensitivity in the high 90sand a specicity in the 70s. 26 One limitation to our data was that some important variables were not measured in our survey instrument.Race, education, and socioeconomic variables, whichcould be confounders, were not recorded during the sur- vey. These could all be barriers to good medical care. We also did not record whether or not the subjects hada primary care physician. As with other studies, coverage of time for running a preventive program in the ED is difcult. We covered12 hours of the day that historical data indicated would cover more than 70% of the patients. We may have missed some high-risk patients who arrived very late atnight or in the early morning. We also missed a signi-cant group of subjects who refused to take part in the survey, and we do not have data on how this refusal group compared with the entered subjects. There are many constraints to an ED-based prevention program, including the need for additional resources,928 Rimple et al. /C15ED-BASED VACCINATION PROGRAMtraining of surveyors, risk management considerations, and system oversight. This study may not be generaliz-able to nonacademic centers where medical students are not available for primary health care and preventive services to the community. Perhaps an ED programsuch as this one could be complementary to commu- nity-based programs, such as public health care visitors or community health centers. CONCLUSIONS On presentation to the ED, fewer than 20% of high-risk subjects are vaccinated for flu and pneumococcaldisease. After evaluation and treatment in our ED vacci- nation program, more than 80% of subjects were up-to- date on vaccination. Age, insurance status, and patients'perceived lack of need were the primary barriers for pa- tients who do not get vaccinations before presenting to the ED during the study period. In the ED setting duringour study period, the only barrier to administration of vaccine was the subject's perceived lack of need, and this was only signicant for flu vaccine. Other than ashortage of vaccine, the only ED barrier to vaccination (perceived need) might be overcome with patient educa- tion.
