She is currently examining the link between neuronal circuits and depression symptoms, and the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation therapy for treating depression in individuals. Mirrione's research has been published in national journals, including Nature, The Journal of Neuroscience and Synapse. She regularly speaks at conferences and has received many scholarships and awards for her work, including one from the National Science Foundation. For Mirrione, an associate professor of biomedical sciences, the lab is not a solitary place for individual pursuits, but one where she expands her role as an educator. She is most inspired \u2014 personally and professionally \u2014 when mentoring undergraduates on their own research projects, or guiding graduate students through their thesis projects. Mirrione frequently uses visuals to aid in the learning of important principles and concepts. She also believes in connecting ideas through hands-on experiments, which in turn exposes her students to emerging technology and techniques in the process. \"Technology and research methods are constantly changing,\" she said. \"It is important that our students are not intimidated "}
