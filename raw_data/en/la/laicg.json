Connectivity has proven an outstanding strategy and path to excellence as evidenced by the level of care we proudly provide patients. We are committed to offering the finest compassionate, quality care, examples of which are illustrated in this Annual Report. The past year was marked by many important milestones and significant accomplishments including Evanston Hospital's renewed status as a Level One Trauma Center, and approval as the only Certified Stroke Center on theNorth Shore. The dedicated Stroke Center at Evanston Hospital will help our communities combat the third leadingcause of death and the number one cause of disability in the United States. Our Oncology Program was ranked among the 50 best programs in the country by U.S. News & World Report for the second consecutive year, an important recognition of the multi-specialty team of renowned cancer specialists conducting research and connecting patients to the latest promising treatment options at our Kellogg Cancer CareCenters.The Patricia G. Nolan Center for Breast Health opened at Glenbrook Hospital this spring. This comprehensive diag- nostic and treatment facility was established through a connection to the generosity of the Daniel F. and Ada L. RiceFoundation with a $1.5 million grant. Anew Comprehensive Prostate Cancer Center also opened, providing comprehensive care and featuring multi- specialty cooperation all under one roof. The Center represents a new direction in prostate cancer treatment, enablingateam of physicians to determine the best treatment method for each individual patient. Through our leadership role in implementing the first Methicillin-Resistant-Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screen- ing program, Evanston Northwestern Healthcare was selected by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) to help lead its 5 Million Lives Campaign to help train other hospitals in this critically-important initiative. We received theprestigious national Eisenberg Award for this work as well. For the fourth consecutive year, Evanston Northwestern Healthcare was named one of the nation's Most Wired hospital systems, demonstrating our national leadership in information technology as an important tool for improvingcare and service throughout our organization. All of our achievements and continued goals for excellence in care, education and research are made possible through our many generous donors. The tremendous success of The Campaign for Evanston Northwestern Healthcareprevails as we are now near our second phase goal of raising $150 million. Welost an inspirational partner and true friend of this institution last year with the death of Charles R. Walgreen. We are enormously grateful to Mr. Walgreen and his family for their leadership and philanthropic support. Philanthropy remains absolutely critical to our capacity to provide high quality care as the economics of healthcare are increasingly challenging. From soaring malpractice expenses to reductions in federal and state reimbursements,the business climate for hospital systems faces sustained adversity. Our connection to the community is reflected in our stated mission \"to preserve and improve human life,\" to that end we have taken community benefits to another level again this year. We have expanded demonstrated communitybenefit activities to include an even wider ar ray of wellness and health education pr ograms, and we br oadened our efforts to provide care to needy and uninsured individuals in our communities. All told, Evanston Northwestern Healthcar econtributed nearly $150 million of community benefits across our system of care. Among the most impor tant milestones of the year was the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) unanimous ruling in August which keeps Highland Park Hospital par tof Evanston Nor thwestern Healthcare. The new group of commission- ers reversed a pr evious ruling by their own Administrative Law Judge calling for divestiture of Highland Park Hospital following the 2000 merger. The FTC recognized \"significant improvements\" in patient care services at Highland Park Hospital post mer ger as a critical factor in their decision. Looking ahead, we move for ward with continued confidence and commitment to our mission and our ability to connect with the patients and communities we are privileged to serve. From the leadership of our Boar dof Dir ectors, to the gener osity of our philanthr opic supporters, to the expertise and compassion of our healthcar estaff, to our leading research scientists, our connections represent our strength and create an important value equation for all. Connie K. Duckworth Mark R. Neaman Chairman of the Board President and Chief Executive Of ficer 34TThis is a story about the value of teamwork; not some loose idea of collaboration or a marketing slogan, but real, seamless teamworkthat led to the finest care and best possible outcome for a serious-ly injured 16-year-old. Running a little late for rehearsal, Max Tiller ran through the halls of Glenbrook South High School toward the auditorium and, unfortunately, ran into a set of glass doors on his way. Safety glass shattered around him, Tiller lay in the hall without a cut or a scratch, but fairly quickly started to feel \"weird,\" andsensed something was wrong. \"Part of me was hoping it was onlya cracked rib, hoping there was nothing really wrong,\" he said. Within minutes school officials called Tiller's parents' cell phones and minutes later Randy and Vicki Tiller arrived and immediately took their son to theGlenbrook Hospital Emergency Room. \"My husband and I crossed the threshold of shatter ed glass to find him tolerating first aid, but with that look in a 16-year-old's eyes that says 'Iam not ok,'\" said Vicki Tiller, in a letter followingthe incident. A nurse for 30 years, Vicki Tiller watched her son with both a clinician and a mother 's eye. \"At first his condition was not yet completely obviousto me or maybe I was just quieting that littlevoice of alar m,\" she said. The Glenbrook ER staff moved swiftly from the initial contact with triage nurse Mar tha Cr onin, RN, to an evaluation with nurse Kris Dayrit, RN, and Emergency Physician Morris Kharasch, MD, who quickly determined that Max Tiller was in serious condition. All the while Nursing Supervisor Kathy Sammon, RN, was \"professionally iller thr ough what was to be a long night. What Max Tiller had hoped was a cracked rib, was actually a lacerated spleen caused by the impact of the metal bar in the center of the door. Thanks to Dr. Kharasch's astute observationand quick call for a CAT Scan, they knew it was necessary to move him to the Level One T rauma Center at Evanston Hospital. The Glenbrook ER team began the transfer process, informing the trauma surgeon at Evanston, securing an Intensive Care Unit(ICU) bed and maintaining Max T iller's stability until transport. \"But more than the phone calls and the consultations some- thing else happened in the ER that my husband and I will alwaysremember and be grateful for, the staff carried us emotionallythrough this scary night,\" Vicki Tiller wrote. Everything was moving accor ding to plan as Max T iller was readied for transpor t, and then on the transpor t cart his blood pressure dropped and Dr. Kharasch was concerned that there could be increased internal bleeding.After giving him some IV fluids and securing blood to go with him in transport just in case it was needed on the way, Dr.Kharasch got in the ambulance with his patient and took the ride to Evanston Hospital. Not standard procedure by any means, Dr. Kharasch said he felt more comfortable accompanying Max Tiller so he was there to give him blood if needed, and monitor his condition along the way. Dr. Kharasch remembers making small talk with Max Tiller all the way to Evanston Hospital. Max Tiller remembers that Dr.Kharasch wasn't laughing at his jokes quite as much as he had inthe ER. \"I knew I had internal bleeding, but I wasn't panicking,\"Max Tiller said. In fact all three of the Tillers remained calm throughout the ordeal, confident in the treatment and compassion they were receiving. Trauma surgeon James Boffa, MD, was wait- ing for the Tillers when they arrived at Evanston.\"It's not what he said, but how he said it that gave us the sense that Max was in knowledgeable,empathetic and kind hands,\" said Randy Tiller. Splenic lacerations are graded from one to five, with five being the worst and always requiring surgery\u2014Max Tiller's injury was a four, his spleen almost completely severed. Removing the spleen is consider ed a last r esort as it leaves patients at greater risk for infection and other complications for the r est of their lives. Fortunately for Max Tiller he was able to heal under observa- tion in the ICU avoiding sur gery. \"Treating somebody with a splenic injury, you don't want to operate if you don't have to. The only way you can watch a patient like this is if you have an operating team standing by 24/7, he could have star ted bleeding again at any time,\" explained Dr . Boffa. \"A case like this is the reason to have a Level One Trauma Center...it's a great example of the benefits of the system.\" Dr. Kharasch agreed that Max Tiller's case exemplifies the values of ENH connections. \"The communication is smooth, we'reable to initiate all the resources of the institution...it is seamless because the institution is set up that way ,\" he said. The connection between Max Tiller's ENH physicians went one level deeper as his pediatrician Patrick Gries, MD, was also involvedin this case, helping to keep the big pictur e in mind and serving as a resource for the family. This was unfortunately not the first emer- gency for Max T iller who suf fered a collapsed lung the year befor e. \"Dr. Gries' insight and ability to identify Max's medical needs has been pivotal in obtaining good outcomes,\" Vicki Tiller said. Those\"good outcomes\" mean that Max T iller can continue to pursue his vast ar ray of activities with his seemingly endless ener gy\u2014a sur e sign of the team's success.Expert, Supportive Team Helps Teen Heal From left James Boffa, MD; Patrick Gries, MD; and Axtmann, RN, with their nurse hosts.From Sally Feiertag, RN; Sid Tan, MD; Connie Herron, RN; and Tiffany Gwartney, RN.WWhat started as a casual question and long shot sign-up on a bulletin board became a compelling and successful humanitari- an mission connecting ENH neonatal nurses with peers acrossthe globe. \"Bringing Chinese Neonatal Nursing to the 21st Century,\" a teaching exchange, tapped the expertise of ten Infant Special Care Unit (ISCU) nurses from Evanston Hospital who used theirvacation time, energy, money and talent to share their knowledge with fellow nurses in Shanghai and Wenzhou China. Traveling in groups of two and three, ENH nurses each spent a week at Yuying Children's Hospital (YCH) in Wenzhou and two days at Fudan University in Shanghai demonstrating hands-on care and offering a myriad of suggestions for improvements in the resource-challenged Chinese hospitals. An eye-opening experience for nurses on both sides of the exchange, the initiative was designed to helpchange the nursing culture and dramaticallyimprove patient car e in China. Neonatologist Sid T an, MD, who is pursuing collaborative research efforts that will hopefullyresult in clinical trials in China, suggested the possibility of ENH nurses traveling to China following his own visits and observations of thedeficiencies in patient care. Dr. Tan's research on perinatal brain injuries from oxygen deprivation causing conditions like cerebral palsy has led to many promising discoveries in the lab, but the legal climate surrounding malpractice issues in the United States practically prohibits clinical trials with risk involving infants. Calling the ventur e a \"feel good trip for ever ybody ,\" Dr. Tan is quick to praise the nurses who volunteered their generosity and their ability to impart real and valuable lessons amid cultureshock and less than ideal conditions. ISCU Clinical Coor dinator Connie Her ron admits her first reaction to Dr . Tan's suggested trip to China was that it was a crazy idea, but she posted a sign to gauge volunteer interest and soon found herself spearheading fundraising and coordinatingplans for four nursing \"delegations\" that traveled to China fromMarch through May 2007. Shocked by the conditions they saw , Her ron said ther e was no lack of compassion on the part of the Chinese nurses who face a sever e lack of training. \"Even some of the basic things we teach new nurses they did not know ,\" she said. A critical shortage of nurses means rows of babies are left in cribs with bottles propped in their mouths, as the nurses have notime to feed them. \"I expected the worst and some of it fulfilled my expectations,\" Herron said. From basic hygiene to r egular monitoring of babies' conditions, the ENH nurses wer e able to make ver y specific and detailed recommendations, some of which have already been implemented. \"The success of any neonatal unit is based on the nursing,\" said Dr. Tan. The nurses are the first to notice any kind of changein a baby's vital signs or behavior, and their quick response is the key to successful care, he explained. \"Neonatal nurses are really a separate breed, they have a complete sense of responsibility, almost like being a surrogate mother,\" said Dr. Tan. \"We calm our babies, we pick up our babies, we feed our babies,\" Herron said. And when Herron picked up babies at the hospital in China, she said she could feel the Chinese nurses' desire to be able to provide that kind of care. The nurses developed fast friendships and strong bonds with their Chinese counterparts, and many of them are now in regular email communication, and discussing the possibility of future trips. Chinese nurse YaPing Shi, who served as the primary contact person and host, said theexchange was very meaningful to nurses andhospital administration, who ar e now str uggling to improve nursing quality. \"The most important thing we got fr om the American nurses is that they showed us how to do and think as a nurse.In China, we haven' t enough nurses and money to support nursing jobs...We want to train our new nurses to have a professional mode ofthinking.\" \"The most surprising thing we found is how the American nurses love their nursing jobs; they have a kind of passion for their nursing,\" Shi said. Hayley Axtmann, who was the youngest ENH nurse to make the trip, said she was struck by the fact that the nurses have no independence in caring for their patients, and would never consid - er questioning an order or suggesting something to a doctor. \"Theywere surprised at our independence,\" Axtmann said, demonstrat- ing how lessons in patient care also crossed cultural patterns.Lessons on both sides continue to unfold. \"I love my job and I never thought about how lucky we are as nurses caring for babies at a place like this, at this level of quality,\" Herron said. And thanks to the connection and care often volunteers, ther e are many , many babies in China r eceiving better car e today .Furthering Care in China Nurses Connect with Peers Hayley Axtmann Jolanta Borovik Mary CunninghamENH Neonatal Nurses Bringing Chinese Neonatal Nursing to the 21st Century Sally Feier tag Tiffany Luz that is by the community, for the community,\" is how Carol A. Rosenberg, MD, describes the essence of the unique cancer sur- vivorship program she directs at Evanston Northwestern Healthcare. The first community cancer survivorship program in the region, Living in the Future (LIFE), is designed specifically with cancer survivorship guidelines from the Institute of Medicine\u2014the program educates, empowers and enlightens cancer survivors and does so using all the latest science for survivorship care. Implemented in part with a prestigious Community Program grant from the Lance Armstrong Foundation, LIFE provides a bridge from a patient's oncology treatment environment back to their community, family and life. The LIFE pr ogram at Evanston Northwestern Healthcare recognizes survivorship as a distinct phase of care and offers each patient a cus-tomized \"prescription\" or survivorship care planin an electr onic for mat, cr eating a model for the healthcare industry and the estimated 10 million cancer survivors in the United States. A passionate, high-ener gy creative dir ector at an adver tising agency , Arlene W anetick was 51 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. \"Initially I didn't really know what I would need, it' s not par t of your consumer set to know. I just had to go on instinct, gut and faith,\" she said. Wanetick counts several doctors and nurses at Evanston and Highland Park hospitals among her blessings in her personal br east cancer journey, paying tribute to their compassion, consideration,and connections. Fr om the beginning, she considered herself lucky as her cancer was caught early, and she had great confidence in the car e she was receiving. As she made her way through surgery and radiation, Wanetick wanted as much information as she could get, taking notes at everyphysician conversation and reading everything that came her way, including an article or two that talked about survivorship. \"When I first r ead something about a sur vivorship program my reaction was 'this is so smar t, so pr ogressive,'\" W anetick said. When she learned that the LIFE program was underway at Evanston Northwestern Healthcare, she was thrilled. \"I remember thinking I am so glad I am with this institution. Knowing this program existed made me feel like I was going to get better care, it gave me such confidence in this forward-thinking institution,\" Wanetick said. \"I just thought 'they're on top of it!'\" The LIFE program begins with a personal risk adapted visit with clinical coor dinator Car ole Mar tz, RN, MS, who reviews the survivor's cancer histor y and tr eatment and covers medical surveillance guidelines and healthy lifestyle recommendations.Patients are encouraged to ask any and all questions throughouttheir participation in LIFE. \"She is so passionate, knowledgeable and caring, and she gave me lots of useful, tangible information. The program is a great resource, providing confidence and peace of mind,\" Wanetick said of Martz. \"Working with Carole Martz, and going through the data gave me insight into the things I should be paying attention to. Talking with her and developing that vocabulary helped me with tools I need to develop relationships with my physicians,' said breast cancer survivor and LIFE enthusiast Linda Sizemore, PhD. Following their initial visit, LIFE patients are encouraged to attend the program's Thrivership seminars (free and open to the public) including \"Eat to Beat Malignancy and Walk Away from Cancer\" and \"Self Esteem and Sexual Intimacy After Cancer\"facilitated by the LIFE exper t medical team. Dr. Sizemore, who is a clinical psychologist and one of the presenters of the Sexual IntimacyThrivership seminar, knows first-hand the impor-tance of these educational seminars and the valueof the group setting. Dr. Sizemore herself was surprised at her own initial feelings following a mastectomy and r econ- structive sur gery. \"I had a talk with myself, and I said for women everywhere I have to work this out....the more you share it, the easier it becomes.\" The Thrivership seminars, like the compr e- hensive, individual prescriptions for survivorship are all part ofempowering patients to move forward and continue healing. \"We are providing sur vivors with education as a form of support,\" Dr. Rosenberg explained. \"There is a window of opportunity, the right \"teaching moment\" following tr eatment when patients are amenable to hearing about the kind of strategies they can use to modify their risks.\" \"I think knowledge is power and I like that I am now armed with all this information,\" Wanetick said. Dr. Rosenberg works to share knowledge with patients and other healthcare providers, teaching the LIFE health professional course, and ser ving as a clinical assistant pr ofessor at Northwestern University' s Feinber g School of Medicine wher e she has a special interest in mentoring residents in preventive health. American Cancer Society sponsored Preventive Medicine Resident Sara Brenner Spinnato, MD, described her experience with the LIFE program as inspirational. \"Dr. Rosenberg stands as a shining example of how physicians are called to be creative, collaborative, and compassionate in allaspects of healthcare. In implementing this program, her team isdoing something innovative that advances patient car e not only within the confines of the hospital, but also out in the communitywhere survivors live their lives,\" said Dr. Spinnato. \"Cancer survivors today are living rich and active lives, and every survivor needs to feel empowered. There are no guarantees,but LIFE helps navigate the road ahead,\" said Dr. Rosenberg.Living in the Future Connects Cancer Survivors From left, Linda Sizemor e, PhD; Car ol A. Rosenberg, MD; and Arlene Wanetick.10Community Relations OOver the past year, Evanston Northwestern Healthcare expanded its community benefits efforts to include an even wider variety of wellness and health education programs. We maintained our position as a leading institution for cutting-edge research and medical education. We supported local and national organizations\u2014both monetarily and with the time and effort of our employees\u2014that shared our mission and vision of community health. Finally, we broadened our efforts to providecare to needy and uninsured individuals in our communities. All told, Evanston Northwestern Healthcare contributed more than $145 million of community benefits, including $11.6 million incharity care and $17.7 million in subsidized health services. We are committed to taking a leadership role in these efforts by offering resources and support to achieve our mission to preserve and improve human life. But Evanston Northwestern Healthcare is only one of the partners integral to improving thehealth of the communities it serves, and we are indebted to themany community par tners who facilitate and enable the deliver y of care and services. A sampling of how Evanston Northwestern Healthcare contributes to its communities: Evanston In response to a pertussis (whooping cough) outbreak at several North Shore high schools, Evanston Northwestern Healthcare staff administered vaccines to 430 New Trier High School staff and 490 Evanston Township High School students. For more than a decade, Evanston Nor thwestern Healthcare (ENH) has supported the Evanston Township High School (ETHS) Health Center. Staffed by ENH physicians, nurses, and a social worker,the Health Center had 2,755 student visits and tr eated mor e than 1,000 students in the 2005-2006 school year. Glenbrook Glenbrook South High School and Glenbrook Hospital formed a partnership to address the growing problem of access to care,and specifically the inability of low-income students to obtainback-to-school physicals in time to start school. Today, theAccess to Car e Program of fers the primary care services of the Evanston Northwestern Healthcare Family Care Center Medical Group Practice, located at Glenbrook Hospital, to any Glenbrook South High School student. The program also offers back-to-school physicals on the day of school registration, regardless ofa family's ability to pay for preventive health services. Since itsinception in the fall of 2006, the Access to Care program hasserved more than 90 students and their families. \"The Access to Car e program has been a great resour ce for Glenbr ook South and our families,\" said Brian K. Wegley , Principal, Glenbr ook South High School. \"The generosity of the staff's time and the many creative solutions to the problems that arise makes the hospital a truly fantastic nextdoor neighbor.\" Highland Park For the past five years, the Center for Simulation Technology and Academic Research (CSTAR) at Highland Park Hospital has provided valuable hands-on emergency medicine training to medical students and residents in a controlled, state-of-the-art simulator laboratory. The center also utilizes high-fidelity simulators to provide area paramedics, firefighters, police and Department of Health employees with high-impact training in emergency preparedness and bioterrorism. \"Since its inception, CSTAR has focused on patient safety and patient care,\" said Jon V ozenilek, MD, Dir ector, CSTAR. \"CSTAR's space is flexible and faculty are knowledgeable, providing school nurse and firstaid programs one day, and advanced initiatives in patient safety the next.\" Charity Care Charity car e is defined as car e for which the pr ovider does not expect to receive payment from the patient or the third party payer. There are many other components that comprise our community benefits, such as education and research. The totalfinancial value of ENH r eportable community benefits comply with the Illinois Community Benefits Act and the State' s Attor ney General office. To ensure that all residents in our communities have access to quality and compassionate healthcare, theOutpatient Department at Evanston Hospital provides free anddiscounted care to people who lack private health insurance. The Outpatient Department is staffed by nurse practitioners, register ed nurses and r esident physicians, who provide care under the supervision of senior attending physicians on staff at Evanston Northwestern Healthcare. Services available include obstetrics/gynecology, general surgery, orthopaedics, diabetes education and podiatry. TheOutpatient Department had nearly 11,000 patient visits and treated mor e than 4,000 people. \"Many uninsur ed people lack access to r outine, pr eventive health ser vices,\" said Gabriel Berlin, MD, Medical Director of the Outpatient Department. \"By providing regular check-ups and disease management services, the Outpatient Department helps to stabilize chronic conditions and pr event serious emergency situations and costly hospital stays.\" If you would like mor e information regarding how ENH connects to its communities or to r eceive a copy of our 2006-2007 Community Benefits Repor t, write to us at: Community Relations, Evanston Northwestern Healthcare, 2650 Ridge Avenue, Evanston, IL 60201.11Charity Care: $11,607,866 Defined as care for which the provider does not expect to receive payment from the patient or a third-party payer.

As I assumed my role as president of the ENH Foundation in August2007, I was moved by this legacy that supports us in our fundraising and friend-raisingendeavors. These generous individuals and groups, many of whom are grateful patients, sustain the important efforts of our distinguished physicians, scientists, nurses and staff to advance research and education, impact the lives of more patients and families, and provide additional community leadership. Their gifts carry with them a powerful vision of the future because their commitment todaymeans the advancement of crucial medical research and clinical breakthroughs,which ultimately find their way to the hospital bedside in successful treatments and cures. We are humbled and grateful for their remarkable support. In fiscal year 2007, our friends\u2014individuals, foundations and corporations\u2014 helped ENH Foundation raise mor e than $21 million, bringing the total gifts raised thr ough The Campaign for Evanston Northwestern Healthcare to nearly $138 million. This total is 92 percent of our $150 million goal for the end of 2008.Their commitment str engthens and enhances our continuum of car e throughout all the communities we ser ve. This impact of philanthr opy takes many different forms and provides a critical measure of excellence to the care we offer our patients. Whether it creates anEndowed Chair that helps recruit and retain the brightest physicians and scientists,strengthens our clinical programs with leading-edge technology or nurtures promising research, philanthropic support is crucial to Evanston Northwestern Healthcare's mission \"to preserve and improve human life,\" and is par t of what distinguishes our or ganizational cultur e of philanthr opy. Advancing Evanston Nor thwestern Healthcare's institutional priorities continues as the central focus of The Auxiliary of Evanston Nor thwestern Healthcare and The Auxiliary of Highland Park Hospital. Auxiliary members, their families and friends have provided extraordinary personal gifts and time to ENH and they will become even more critical to our future volunteer and community-wide efforts. We are also grateful to the efforts of The Associate Board as it encourages volunteerism and philanthropy among its growing membership. These pages are a testimony to the dedication of all our caregivers and the courage of our patients. And it is through the sensitivity and commitment of our donors that Evanston Nor thwester n Healthcar e continues to make a dif ference in the lives of thousands of individuals and their families every year. We are most honored and grateful for the confidence you have placed in us through your investment in ENH Foundation and our purpose of raising funds and friends to support the mission of Evanston Northwestern Healthcare.

Being informed made a bigdifference to me.\" The outstanding care and patient education information Boynton received at ENH inspired her and her husband, W.Austin (Bud), to make a generous gift to establish and support a new comprehensive orientation program that guides patientsfrom their initial diagnosis to full r ecovery following surgery. This program\u2014 The Boynton Robbins Total Joint Replacement Patient Education Program \u2014is designed to inform and suppor t patients who need total joint replacement surgery of the knee, hip, shoulder, elbow and ankle. \"The program is named in honor of the late Jack L. Robbins, MD, a pioneeringorthopaedic surgeon at Evanston Northwestern Healthcare whotreated Virginia for many years and became a close friend ofours,\" said Bud Boynton. \"Patients who undergo joint replacement procedures often have many questions about their medical care,\" said WilliamRobb III, MD, Chair man, Depar tment of Or thopaedic Surgery and Associate Professor, Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. \"They also are taking more active roles in requestinginformation about their diagnosis, tr eatment options and rehabili- tation plans in or der to partner with their caregivers through all aspects of their tr eatment.\" The Boynton Robbins Total Joint Replacement Patient Education Pr ogram offers answers to patients' concer ns about preparing for sur gery, participating in a post-operative rehabilita- tion program and achieving full recovery so they can remain fully engaged in daily activities and hobbies that keep them vital with - in their families and communities. A critical factor in a successful outcome following total joint replacement is a patient's prepara-tion for the pr ocedure and involvement in the recovery process. \"ENH has a long tradition of pr oviding the latest advances to patients who may need total joint replacements or other interventions to treat complex musculoskeletal disorders,\" said Dr . Robb. \"W ith the aging demographics of our population, combined with the 'baby boomer' generation, the number of people who will need orthopaedic care is estimated to increasefourfold over the next 20 years. Philanthr opic suppor t will play a key role in enhancing program initiatives that directly affect thequality of life for patients every day.\" The T otal Joint Replacement Center at Glenbr ook Hospital is designed to educate, manage and follow ENH patients in orderto help them benefit from the rapidly growing field of total jointreplacement. This centralized pr ogram guides patients thr oughVirginia and Bud Boynton, who created The Boynton Robbins Total Joint Replacement Patient Education Program 15 The ENH Research Institute continues to build a national and international reputation in areas of research with the greatest potential to benefit our patients and communities. Among multi-specialty research hospitals, again this year we are among the top in the United States in funding from the National Institutes of Health. For over a decade the Research Institute has been instrumental in shaping and supportingENH's vision of world-class care by bringing lab research results from the bench to the bedside. The ENH Research Institute celebrated its 10th anniversary year on April 24, 2007. Since its inception, ENH's ranking by the National Institutes of Health has risen from 65 to 20 among the nation's top independent research hospitals. Today ENH is also the #1 independent research hospital in the State of Illinois and the #10 comprehensive independent research hospital in the nation. All in all, FY2007 was another banner year for growing value to our patients. For this we owe our numerous stewards and supporters a debt of gratitude. Richard L. Keyser Leopold G.

The most innovative research connects us all to the future, to hope for enhancedcommunity health and even better ways of preventing, diagnos-ing and treating disease Madeleine Shalowitz, MD, MBA, spent many years as a pediatrician caring for children with complex, chronic issues;children who were failing to thrive and struggling with develop- mental issues. While it was very satisfying helping individual children and families, Shalowitz said she was frustrated thatoverall health conditions for many children were not improving. Dr. Shalowitz is quick to cite some staggering statistics including the fact that 50 years ago an African American womanwas more likely to deliver a premature infant than a whitewoman\u2014the same holds true today. Health disparities in pregnancy, infancy and early childhood have been well documented across racial, ethnic and socioeco-nomic dimensions, but decades of research have failed to reallyexplain the disparities, or provide the information to start makingpositive changes. Dr. Shalowitz is leading an innovative academic-community partnership designed to both develop better research methodsand to empower the community with the right skills to ultimatelyinform public policy and bring about improved programs andservices for children and families. Joining forces with the Lake County Health Department Community Health Center, Dr. Shalowitz formed CommunityAction for Child Health Equity (CACHE) in 2003 after ear ning a major award from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). CACHE is one of just five academic-community partnerships in the country similarly funded. A new $3 million NICHD grant has helped launch Phase 2 which will study the influences of stress and resilience on mothers' healthand birth outcomes. Researchers will consider things like physiologi-cal changes in the fetus and how they may predispose children tocertain problems and conditions like asthma and obesity, both known to be related to stress. Close to 500 families in Lake Countywill be enrolled in this study. \"The members of the community are actively engaged, they really are 50 percent partners in this and are part of bringing aboutthe positive changes,\" said Dr. Shalowitz. \"The hope is that once weunderstand the pathways to these conditions we will understand theavenues for intervention.\" Pablo Gejman, MD, leads the Center for Psychiatric Genetics at Evanston Northwestern Healthcare where he studies clinical andbiologic inherited factors in schizophrenia. He is an internationallyprominent r esear cher who described an association between the trace amine receptor gene 4 and schizophrenia. Schizophrenia, a chronic condition resulting in severe incapacitation and suffering,affects about one per cent of the population. Schizophrenia is similarly prevalent in countries around the world, and is known to cluster in some families. About 10 percent of the schizophrenicpatients also suffer long and severe depression and/or manic periods, and are diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. There iscurrently much more information on many rare genetic disorders caused by single genes, than ther e is for more common conditions, such as schizophrenia, which involve many genes and therefore are far more complex and difficult to study. Dr. Gejman' s team and nine other collaborating institutions (eight in the US and one in Brisbane, Australia) have collected a sample of 4,500 persons with schizophr enia and 4,500 contr ols from the general population to conduct new studies designed to improve the understanding of the biological mechanisms that lead to schizophre-nia, and how they interact with the environmental risks. Last year, Dr. Gejman was selected by the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to conduct a genome-wide experiment of schizophr enia, which will inter rogate 900,000 genetic polymorphisms in patients and in controls to identify susceptibility genes for schizophrenia and schizoaf fective disor der. This will be among the lar gest and most definitive genetic experiments conducted on the disease. He also received a new $5 million research grant from the NIH to support subsequent experiments aimed at characterizing thegenes identified in the \"GAIN\" experiment, in more detail. Dr. Gejman is hopeful that his research will lead to better treatment and earlier diagnosis. \"This research and discovery can make a r eal difference in patients' lives,\" he said.Pablo Gejman, MDMadeleine Shalowitz, MD, MBA182007 was another busy year for ENH Medical Group as we implemented our plans for growth, quality improvement and enhancement of our service and access. Strategic and sustained growth in 2007 added to the ENH Medical Group's depth and expertise, expanding its ability to better serve our patients, families and communities. Nearly 50 net new physicians joined the Medical Group this year withimportant additions in primary care, oncology, neurosurgery, surgical oncology, thoracic surgery, gastroenterology, neurologyand other critical specialties. Growth in specialty coverage and geographic reach reflects the Medical Group's broad goal toprovide more for both patients and referring physicians. To accommodate this growth, a new physician recruitment officewas initiated this year, redesigning recruitment practices for the highest level of efficiency and value. In addition to increasing the number of physicians, the Medical Group also recorded a 12 percent increase in net revenue, an 8 percent growth in patient visits, and significant increases in physician work units, known as RVU's (relativevalue unit is a well known gover nment for mula). R VU's in fiscal year 2007 were up nearly 7 percent overall and 11 percent in primar y care, representing the third consecutive year of double-digit growth. New offices in Mundelein, Gurnee, and Highland Park add to the Medical Group's geographic spread and capabilities. In addition to gr owth, a continued emphasis on customer loyalty and ser vice values has been a key focus for the Medical Gr oup this year . In par ticular we have paid close attention to our specialists and enhancing loyalty among our r efer- ring physicians. A Specialty Leadership Committee was formed to consider issues related to primary care practice needs like access, service, communication and feedback. In that regard, the ability for all physicians to now directly schedule referrals and appointments in EPIC, our electronic medical records system, is yet another key to continued loyalty and success. We continue to push physician leadership oppor tunities, building a broad cadre of engaged physicians to lead the Medical Group's growth and development. Physician leaders are given the chance to attend programs at Northwestern University' s Allen Center. In every aspect from performance to risk management, physician leaders are actively engaged in developing best practices and focusing on how the Medical Group can continually do better, reaching aggressive goals forgrowth and customer loyalty. The success of the Medical Group is truly a collaborative effort and every member of this team deserves credit for our continued accomplishments. While we are proud of our record, we will continue to strive for even more in the coming year.We remain passionate about providing our patients the highest level of care and service and offering our staff the finest organization for successful car eer development. We look to the future with confidence and goals of continued growth and success. David P. Winchester, MD Joseph Golbus, MD Chair man President ENH Medical Group ENH Medical Group 19 Growth in services delivered, a bonus for delivering quality care to our patients and control over manageable expenses combined to produce strong operating results forEvanston Northwestern Healthcare during the year ended September 30, 2007. All major lines of the Corporation contributed as inpatient, outpatient and the Faculty Practice attained record revenue levels. Total Operating Revenue, after reduction for the delivery of uncompensated care, was a record $1.2 billion.Reflecting higher levels of patient activity, expenses of $1.15 billion were 7 percent higher than fiscal 2006. Unaudited Income from Operations for the fiscal year was $52.2 million which is a 25 percent improvement over the audited resultsfor the year ended September 30, 2006. Unaudited Operating Margin at 4.3 percent was 16 percent over the 3.7 percentmargin produced in fiscal 2006. Solid operating performance allowed the Corporation to continue to invest in growing services and in our employees. During the year , $89 million of capital was invested to impr ove ser vices including the first stage of the r ebuilding of the operating r ooms and the intensive car e unit at Evanston Hospital, advanced imaging equipment and enhancements to our systems. Additionally , $15 million was added to the employee pension plan. Not withstanding these investments, total debt decr eased $25 million. Elsewhere in this report, the year's highlights in patient care and research have been noted. Administratively, an important improvement in patient care and safety occurred with the opening in the second quarter of the Corporation'snew data center . All major systems have now been moved to and are operating from the new data center; and the original data center in Evanston has been conver ted to a back up site. Effectively, we have increased the connectivity of our patient systems and significantly lower ed the chance that those systems would be unavailable due to failur e or natural disaster. Fiscal 2008 opens with continued environmental challenges. We continue to serve a growing number of patients who are uninsured or underinsured; Medicare and Medicaid continue to reimburse healthcare providers at less than cost and,despite reporting $146 million of benefit provided to the Community in the previous year, our tax status continues to bequestioned. These ar e familiar issues for our industr y; and while they ar e distractions, they will not pr event our dedicated physicians and staff from continuing to connect with our patients to deliver the quality care they expect and deserve.
