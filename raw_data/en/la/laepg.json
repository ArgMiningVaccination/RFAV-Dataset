Plus, we'll introduce you to lots of interesting ways to use it that you never even thought of. What Is Herbal Tea? Although it has the word \"tea\" in it, herbal tea is not technically tea at all. This is because it does not contain the leaf buds or leaves of tea plants. Instead, herbal tea is made from blends or infusions of dried flowers, fruits, spices, or herbs in water. These are known as tinases. Unlike teas that come from tea plants, tinases do not contain caffeine, making them ideal for promoting calmness and [reducing anxiety.](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/mental-health/stress-anxiety-relief/panic-attack-prevention/) How Is Herbal Tea Used In TCM? According to registered TCM Physician Lim Sock Ling, food is thy medicine, and medicine is thy food. Herbal tea is part of TCM diet therapy. \"Similar to the concept of TCM, herbal tea helps to balance the body system and brings benefit to the body. It is simple to prepare and more acceptable by consumers,\" Physician Lim stated. Herbal teas are the primary source of dietary antioxidants in many cultures. They are widely represented in the traditional medicine of various cultures.

The type of tea you use should dictate what you use it for. Physician Lim stated that [longan red date tea ](https://www.euyansang.com/en_US/women-pre-post-natal/qi-%26-blood-nourishing-tea-955616070059G.html?getthis=false#q=red%2520date%2520tea&start=1)is usually used for [postpartum healing](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/pregnancy-and-childrens-health/postnatal-care/postpartum-care/). \"It's made by boiling longan, red dates, goji berries, and codonopsis root.

According to one [study](https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(05)83557-7/pdf), it helps in promoting calmness and may reduce colic. According to Physician Lim, \"Apigenin - a compound found in chamomile - helps relax the muscles and offers a sedative effect to [extend sleep duration ](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/mental-health/sleep/lack-of-sleep-effects/)when given before bedtime.\" \"However, it is advisable to seek a professional's guidance before use. It is also not advisable to introduce this to infants younger than 6 months old or when solids have not been introduced,\" cautioned Physician Lim. Rooibos One [study ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20144258/)found that [rooibos tea ](https://www.euyansang.com/en_US/food/teas/rooibos-tea-955616012076.html)inhibited an enzyme that causes blood vessels to constrict, similar to how a common blood pressure medication does. Another [study ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20833235/)found that drinking six cups of rooibos tea daily for six weeks lowered blood levels of \"bad\" LDL cholesterol and fat while increasing \"good\" HDL cholesterol. Always speak to a doctor before using Rooibos tea to lower blood pressure, especially if you are on blood pressure medication.

Ginseng contains two significant compounds: ginsenosides and gintonin. These compounds complement one another to provide health benefits. Here are seven evidence-based health benefits: - Contains beneficial [antioxidant and anti-inflammatory](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23356855/)properties - May benefit cognitive function: One [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11895046/)found that people who consumed 200 mg of Panax ginseng daily for four weeks had improvements in mental health, social functioning, and mood. In another [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23717092/), Ginseng benefited mental functions. It also promoted feelings of calmness and mood in both healthy people and those with Alzheimer's disease. - Assists with erectile dysfunction: One [study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16855773/)found that red ginseng decreases oxidative stress in tissues and enhances blood flow in penile muscles. - Helps strengthen the immune system - It has potential benefits against cancer: [Ginsenosides](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25347695/)in ginseng seem to regulate inflammation, provide antioxidant protection and maintain the health of cells. This could help decrease the risk of certain kinds of cancer. Nevertheless, more research is needed. [Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23613825/)show it can help fight fatigue and increase energy levels - It may help lower blood glucose: Ginseng, particularly [fermented red ginseng](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18955300/), may help increase insulin production, enhance blood sugar uptake in cells and provide antioxidant protection.

Is Flowering Tea The Same As Herbal Tea? Flowering tea is also known as blooming tea. It consists of a bundle of dried tea leaves wrapped around one or more dried flowers. These are made by binding tea leaves and flowers together into a bulb, then setting them to dry. When steeped, the bundle expands and unfurls in a process that emulates a blooming flower, and the flowers inside emerge as the centerpiece. Flowers commonly used in flowering teas include globe amaranth, chrysanthemum, jasmine, lily, hibiscus, and osmanthus. According to Physician Lim, \"Flowers are added to boost the sensory delights of the tea and enhance its therapeutic effect. However, the medicinal concentration is usually low and the therapeutic effects are derived from tea leaves instead.\" \"When flowers are added in larger concentrations, they will exhibit their therapeutic effects. For example, chrysanthemum clears Wind-Heat and helps to detox,\" Physician Lim continued. How to use flowering tea According to Physician Lim, here are some possible uses of flowering tea: - It may bring about psychological benefits by calming the mind - It contains antioxidant catechins that may reduce the risk of [heart disease,](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/general-health/cardiovascular-health/heart-disease-quiz/)support metabolic health, and prevent [type 2 diabetes](https://www.allthingshealth.com/en-us/general-health/energy-and-immunity/type-2-diabetes-diet/) - May help reduce the risk of cancer by preventing cell damage and abnormal cells that may become cancer - Can help support good oral health by decreasing cavities, reducing the risk of periodontitis, and combatting bad breath Thanks to its natural medicinal properties, there are endless ways to use herbal tea.
