The ISAR presidents during this period reflect on the functioning of ISAR in the years of their tenure as well as on the most important evolutions and discoveries in the field of antiviral research and drug development. We are very sad that former presiden t Chris McGuigan passed away much too early. Chris made a major contribution to modernizing the society. We will always remember his enthusiasm. It is notable that before the discovery of acyclovir in 1977 it was doubted that it would ever be possible to develop safe and effective antiviral drugs. However, potent antiretrovirals are now saving the lives of millions, turning HIV into a chronic infection and we have witnessed a medical revolution in the treatment and cure of hepatitis C. These truly remarkab le achievements clearly demonstrate the potential of highly potent, selective and safe antivirals and allow us to look to the future with confidence and optimism. There have also been in recent years exciting new developments in the treatment and prophylaxis of infections: with the influenza virus, resulting recently in the approval of an endonuclease inhibitor, the cytomegalovirus, resulting in the approval of a terminase inhibitor and the approval of post -exposure prophylactic treatment of HIV. Meanwhile major efforts are ongoing to develop potent drugs against RSV. Similarly, HBV infection is a manageable disease and important efforts are ongoing to identify a functional cure to hepatitis B. Yet for many viruses, most of which are emerging or neglected, n o drugs are available. Important challenges thus remain to be confronted. We are convinced that major advances will be made during the coming years. ISAR and ICAR will continue to be a forum for the dissemination of scientific findings and of debate on th e development of new strategies to combat viral infections. We thank Anthony Vere Hodge for serving as the editor of this interesting brochure and hope that you will enjoy reading it.

Contribution s from former Presidents Introduction The following request was sent by Bob Buckheit to all past Presidents: Dear ISAR Past Presidents - the Society is currently working on final details of our Third Decade volume. As an addition to past volumes and to help consider the full history of the Society and the development of antiviral agents I would like to request a short paragraph from each of you with responses to the two following questions: 1. During your tenure as President what was the primary focus of antiviral research, i.e., what was the major threat to human health that was the subject of the most focus and development. 2. Durin g your tenure as President what changes occurred within the Society that contributed to the future growth of the Society. These are the replies which we have received. Perhaps it was too much to hope that every past President would contribute to this article but, if this publication inspires the \"missing\" Presidents, it would be a great addition to this historic review covering 30 years. It would be easy to add these new contributions to an electronic version of the \"3rd Decade\" booklet. With Williamsburg being called the 2 nd ICAR, which meeting was the first ICAR, Rotterdam or Il Ciocco? This question is still being asked, e ven during the preparation of this booklet. Both the First and Second Decade booklets list Rotterdam, The Netherlands, (April 30 - May 3, 1985) as the first ICAR, this being the first truly international meeting focused entirely on Antiviral Research. George Galasso gave his view: As one of the principal originators of the ICAR, I must state emphatically that the first ICAR meeting should be Rotterdam. That is when I meet with Erick De Clercq and Fons Billiau and suggested that we initiate a Society with t hem as leaders. I could not, being a Government worker. They said the leadership should be from the US since most of the antiviral work at the time was in the US. That is when I approached Earl Kern and Rich Whitley to assume leadership with me as backgrou nd support. That is why Richard became the first President and Earl ran the early meetings. Erik De Clercq, in his 25th ICAR anniversary lecture at Sapporo (April 2012), explained the role of Il Ciocco, Italy (May 1987): As a clarification, Williamsburg of 1988 was the second International Conference on Antiviral Research (ICAR). There was no meeting called the 'First ICAR' but the Rotterdam meeting of 1985 has generally been referred to as the first ICAR. Erik considers Il Ciocco as the 'virtual first' because it can be regarded as a model for ICAR meetings and ideas about both ISAR and ICAR were developed at that meeting. 1st & 2nd Decade Presidents Erik De Clercq (1990 -1992) I became President -Elect of ISAR in 1988, to proceed to President in 1990 at the occasion of the 3rd ICAR in Brussels. At that time, the major focus of antiviral research was still concentrated, as it had been from the 2nd ICAR meeting in Williamsburg, on herpesviruses. The impact of HIV, although discovered in 1983 as the cause of a disease (AIDS) first described in 1981, was at that time rapidly growing in importance, with AZT (zidovudine) being the only drug licensed for clinical use. 4 The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade The ICAR meeting in Brussels marked the inauguration (inception) of all kinds of committees and activities associated with the Society, the most important aspect being the triangle relationship between the Society (ISAR), the conferences which it was going to organize (and still does) annually (ICAR), and, third, the Journal (Antiviral Research) that had been created in 1981, coincidentally the same year that AIDS had been identified. Erik De Clercq George Galasso (1992- 1994) Money for AIDS research was not released by President Reagan until 1988 after the death of Rock Hudson so it didn't make an im pact on AIDS research and consequently on antiviral research until the early 90s. The major benefits were to AIDS, herpes and hepatitis. The ISAR was still undergoing growing pains; we revised the By- Laws, and set up criteria for co - sponsorship of scienti fic meetings. The ISAR News was initiated with Bob Sidwell as the long running editor and John Drach was appointed the ISAR archivist. We were undergoing financial difficulties, the Society was in debt for the first time. Measures were put in place to overcome the difficulties; dues were raised from $25 to $50 per year and stronger fund raising efforts were put into play and we were back in surplus. George Galasso Hugh J Field (1994 -1996) Recollections of a former President of ISAR I was President duri ng the period 1994- 1996. This is about 10 years after HIV had first emerged as a major threat to human health. Up to this time most success with antivirals had been with herpesviruses. One of the features of antiviral research in the herpes field at th is time was the friendly but strongly competitive rivalry between the researchers from the then Burroughs Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham companies promoting valaciclovir and famciclovir, respectively for the treatment and recall that during the ICAR Santa Fe (1995) the big news broke that Burroughs Wellcome and the Wellcome Foundation were to be sold thereby producing a huge financial benefit for the Wellcome Trust research funds. However, Wellcome was acquired by Glaxo to become Glaxo Wellcome starting a process of amalgamation that would change the career paths for many of the existing Wellcome virus researchers. On the HIV front there wa s much discussion of RT nucleoside and non- nucleoside inhibitors and the development of HIV antiviral resistance had already become a major focus of attention. Pandemic influenza was certainly recognized as a major threat during this era, but the importan ce of the active compounds Relenza\u00ae and oseltamivir were yet to emerge. There was relatively little interest yet in the hepatitis viruses as a potential antiviral target at this time. Not long previously, there had been discussion as to whether or not the ICAR should be an annual meeting or just every other year! It was probably the rapid development of antiviral research in the HIV field that confirmed that an annual ICAR would prevail. Regarding development of ISAR, a lot of effort had been devoted to developing the present constitution and committee structure. I am not sure of the exact dates but early on, several of the current ISAR committees were still fairly informal without the production of annual written reports etc. These processes were establ ished by then and another change, I think was now in train was the idea of fixed terms of office for the society officers and board of directors to ensure a regular turn -around. These changes had been recently codified The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade 5 in a new version of the society bye -laws. [Editor's comment: The acceptance is mentioned by Joe within his contribution (in 2010)] Hugh Field 3rd Decade Presidents Christopher (Chris) McGuigan (2006 -2008) During Chris's tenure, the main focus of antiviral research was centered on HIV treatment and the exploration of novel targets. Indeed, the mini symposium in Montreal (2008) was dedicated to this theme. In addition, we could see the rapid increase in abstracts on the development on HCV inhibitors throughout the two years of hi s time as president. Once again, ISAR recognized this trend by organizing a dedicated mini -symposium at the 20th ICAR, in Palm Springs (2007). As President, Chris opened the ISAR board meetings to the committee chairs. Also, it was Chris who initiated the conversion of ISAR from the paper age to the electronic age. Chris digitalized many of the Society's operations, as indicated by the quotes from the President's messages in the ISAR News. 2007: For the second time, an electronic election was conducted. E -mail ballots were sent to approximately 440 registered members of ISAR. More than 100 members responded casting more than 200 votes. This represents a greater than 25% turnout based on non- failing emails. 2008; As last year, we will run an electronic ballot from the President's office in Cardiff. It will be entirely e-mail based - so please check your e- mail address at the ISAR Website. 2008: Finally, this year we will be unveiling a new online membership list, which will replace the hard copy. Many so cieties have gone this route, and we believe it will offer members a number of advantages. The lists will be password protected and will represent a further benefit to membership. They will be much more easily searchable than the hard copy too! We are grat eful to Brent Korba and his team for organizing this. Another of Bob's ideas is being trialed in the Poster Sessions in 2008. A first for ICAR, we will have 'shotgun' posters, where a small number of posters from each session will be selected for short oral presentations. If you have a poster in Montreal - do come prepared with a few slides! Lastly, my warm thanks to International Medical Press for their complimentary publishing of this year's ISAR News and to Courtesy Associates for their outstanding support for the meeting. [Editor's note: Robert (Bob) Sidwell started the ISAR News in July 1991, continuing as Editor until 2008. Chris McGuigan was keen to convert the ISAR News to an electronic format. Hugh Field, then Editor -in-Chief of Antiviral Chemistry & Chemotherapy (AVCC) negotiated with International Medical Press to publish the ISAR News in AVCC, on a free access basis. This step not only reduced the cost to ISAR but also greatly increased its distribution.] Andrea Brancale for Chris McGuigan Amy K Patick (2008 -2010) During my tenure, the primary focus continued to be on antivirals direct ed towards human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The creation and subsequent availability of HCV subgenomic replicons however, quickly led to an unparalleled amount of activity in the discovery and development of anti -HCV agents. Other efforts were directed towards pandemic response planning directed against avian influenza A (H5N1). The emergence of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in April 2009 not only led to a surge in antiviral discovery efforts 6 The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade but also threatened the May 5th 22nd ICAR meeting in Miami, FL. On April 29th, WHO raised the influenza pandemic alert from 4 to 5. This led to a hurried teleconference among myself (President), Joe Colacino (President Elect) and Chris McGuigan (Past President). After reviewing the travel restrictions (none for U .S.), we decided to go ahead with the meeting and provide liberal refund policies for those whose countries did not allow travel. What better time could there have been for expert Virologists to come together to discuss antivirals! During my tenure I conti nued to grow and promote the culture of open transparency, inclusion, honest communications and a willingness to let young (and old) investigators from a diverse backgrounds assume Society responsibility freely. Other changes that contributed to the future growth of the Society included incorporation of best practices from project management, including establishment of frequent telecommunications with developed agendas and follow -up with action items, establishment of a common set of templates and presentat ions (business meeting, Elion and Prusoff award, travel award, etc.) that could be handed down from President to President. Perhaps the biggest change was the purposeful recruitment and promotion of women in leadership and award positions within the Societ y. At the beginning of my tenure, no woman had yet to win the prestigious Trudy Elion award in 22 years and only 2 of 11 (18%) Boards of Directors were women. Today the number of woman in leadership positions has grown to 4 of 11 (36%) members of ISAR Boar d of Director and some awards (Prusoff) now boast women as recipients. But we still have a way to go to recognize more women across all major awards categories. Amy Patick Joe Colacinco (2010- 2012) My tenure as ISAR president began at the closing of the 2 3 rd ICAR in San Francisco at which President Amy Patick passed the gavel to me. During this time, our economy was slowly rebounding from a severe recession which presented personal and professional financial challenges to our members. Nevertheless, ISAR remained financially healthy and ICARs were well attended. I was fortunate to follow Amy as president as she was a source of knowledge and guidance and left me with a scientifically and financially successful Society. As President, I worked with an excel lent team of officers (Amy Patick Past President; Phil Furman, President -elect; Dale Barnard, Treasurer, and Susan Cox, Secretary), board members and committee chairs to maintain the Society's high standards of scientific excellence, enhance our relevance, continue its openness, and provide a welcoming atmosphere to new members. During my first year as president, the 24 th ICAR was held in Sofia, Bulgaria where our local host was Dr. Angel Galabov. Bob Buckheit and his program committee worked diligently t o put together a scientifically excellent program including a \"Drug Discovery 101\" session which we continued based on highly favorable feedback from ISAR members. Our initiative in career development and placement for junior investigators continued and our Career Happy Hours evolved into Career Breakfasts at which networking opportunities were made available. Tomas Cihlar and the Placement Committee enthusiastically organized and oversaw this event. Throughout my presidency, the highly effective and tire less fund -raising efforts of Roger Ptak were instrumental in keeping the Society solvent and able to meet its goals. In 2010, we held an electronic election which was highly successful due to the efforts of Andrea Brancale who was chair of the ISAR website committee. The election also included voting on updates to the Society by- laws as discussed by the board and proposed by Jack Secrist, John Drach, and Phil Furman. These changes were regarding Board membership; candidacies for the offices of treasurer and secretary; term lengths for officers, board members, and committee chairs; appointments of committee chairs; filling office vacancies; roles and responsibilities of the President and Secretary; electronic communications and balloting; and non -budgeted expenses. The proposed changes were posted on our website for 30 days prior to the election and were accepted by the members. The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade 7 During the second year of my presidency, The Silver Anniversary ICAR was held in Sapporo, Japan and was co -sponsored by the Japa nese Association for Antiviral Therapy (JAAT). We received generous support for this conference from the Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association of Japan. Prof. Masanori Baba, who was the local host for this ICAR, was recognized for his e fforts in securing this important funding. To commemorate the Society's 25th Anniversary, Society Founder and Former President Prof. Erik De Clercq delivered a lecture reviewing the previous 25 years of antiviral drug discovery and development. Through t he efforts of Andrea Brancale, the ISAR website received a new look and new capabilities including an enhanced member directory, navigation to external links, facilitated membership renewal and conference registration, and electronic balloting. A signific ant change during this period was that rather than publishing the ICAR program and abstracts in Antiviral Research , they were made available on the ISAR -ICAR website to members with a user ID and password. This change enabled the conference organizers to extend the abstract submission deadline allowing greater flexibility for conference attendees and abstract reviewers. My years as president of ISAR were concurrent with exciting advances in antiviral drug discovery and development. In 2011, two HCV prot ease inhibitors were approved by the FDA for the treatment of chronic HCV infection, a disease which reached epidemic proportions during this time resulting in significant mortality and morbidity. Other direct antiviral agents for HCV were in late stage de velopment at this time and offered great promise for reducing or eliminating the need for interferon and ribavirin and providing a clinical cure for this lethal disease. As of this writing, that promise has largely been fulfilled by the work of Society me mbers. At the close of the Sapporo meeting I had the great honor of passing the gavel to Phil Furman. I can only hope that I left the Society in as good a shape for Phil as Amy left it for me! Joe Colacinco Phillip (Phil) Furman (2012 -2014) During my t enure as President we saw the approval of s ofosbuvir, which led the way to a cure for HCV infections. HIV and HBV continued to receive a great deal of focus. Eradication of HIV was a topic of great interest and research. HBV research focused on targeting ccc DNA as well as other potential targets involved in the HBV replication cycle. New therapeutic approaches including drugs other than nucleoside analogs and immunotherapeutic approaches were being explored. The Ebola outbreak, which killed over 11,000 peo ple, began in Guinea December of 2013 and declared an international health emergency by WHO in 2014. Subsequently Ebola as well as other emerging viruses have received much more attention. During my tenure as President several changes/additions occurred wi thin the Society. To honor Anton\u00edn (Toni) Hol\u00fd and his legacy, the Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd Memorial lecture award was established and funded by Gilead Sciences, Inc. The second addition was the establishment of the Women in Science Program by Amy Patick. The program was such a success that it became a permanent part of ICAR. Eventually Amy and her committee introduced a mentoring program and a scholarship program to the Women in Science Program. So as to maintain a historical record of ISAR and ICAR the Archives Commi ttee was established. The officers and board re- evaluated and changed the ISAR membership fee structure. Phil Furman Robert (Bob) Buckeit (2016 -2016) During my term as President (2014- 2016) the world of antiviral drug discovery and development continued to celebrate successes in the approval of new and improved drugs to treat HIV infection as well as apparent cures for HCV. During my years as President a shift in focus from these viruses to a focus on HBV and emerging threats 8 The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade such as Zika, Dengue and Ebola occurred. In 2015 and 2016 a major outbreak of Zika infections occurred in Brazil and a large outbreak of Ebola occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo with an unusually large number of cases and fatalities. Thus, my term was marked by a shift to finding a cure for HIV, treatments and cure for HBV and a real focus on emerging viral threats. The main goals of my years as President of the Society was to continue efforts to bring more chemistry back to the Society's annual meeting and membership with the first Antonin Holy Memorial Award given in 2014. Additionally I engaged members of the Society from around the world to focus on the growth of ISAR me mbership in areas where we had minimal presence by establishing the ISAR Ambassador's Program. This program was designed to provide ISAR information to the individuals in various geographic locations in the world and to empower them to recruit new members to ISAR from their locales. Lastly, my term included a major focus on energizing young members of the Society through networking activities and social functions as well as bringing these young scientists into prominent roles within the Society's committees in order to provide for a transition of leadership from current management to the next generation of scientists needed to keep the Society thriving. I thought it was important to provide a venue where young investigators could meet established ISAR member s and Officers in a social environment to get to know one another. During my term we also began efforts to establish an ISAR webinar to provide increased visibility to the Society as well as add value to the membership. The Women in Science Program that had been established during my President Elect years became active with the establishment of the Chu Family Foundation Scholarship Awards first presented in 2015. Finally, in order to add greater value to a membership in ISAR, during my tenure as President t he ISAR News was greatly improved by doubling the number of issues that were prepared each year and by greatly increasing the scientific content of each issue through submission of scientific reviews and the use of guest editors. Bob Buckeit Jos\u00e9 Est\u00e9 (2016 -2018) During this last decade we have witnessed how research and development of antiviral drugs have clearly impacted on the well -being of humans and society in general. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been recognized as an effective strategy to thwart and contain the spread of HIV infection. Undetectable viremia following effective ART, restores health and quality of life of HIV individuals, limits HIV transmission and prevents the spread of infection in unprecedented ways. Now, antiretr oviral treatment has been simplified to single pill regimens with fixed -dose combinations (FDC) or by reducing the composition to minimal drug components once undetectable viremia has been achieved. FDC allow for increased adherence to treatment and reduced drug- related unwanted effects. Current efforts are also focused on the development of long- acting antiretrovirals that could be used for both HIV treatment and prevention. The recent LATTE -2 clinical trial (Margolis et al. Lancet 2017) evaluating long- acting injectable formulations of cabotegravir and rilpivirine, taken once every four or eight weeks, showed maintained viral suppression in most participants. This study demonstrated efficacy comparable to daily three- drug oral therapy and paves the way to even simpler and effective ART regimens. Fundamental and clinical anti -HIV research has shifted towards the identification of ways to intervene and cure HIV infection. Despite enormous advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of disease, the immu nology of HIV infection and of host -pathogen interactions, sufficient knowledge to design effective, curative strategies is still not there yet. HIV latency, as the means to purge the virus reservoir, is the target of current efforts but we are also beginning to identify immune -based strategies as potential curative options. Direct acting antivirals targeting hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have become standard care and are recognized as a true scientific \"miracle\". Hepatitis C is a curable disease and we begin to envision the difficult but The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade 9 possible eradication of HCV through the use of effective health measures and antiviral treatment. Containment and eradication of HCV appear now to be more in the hands of politicians, stakeholders and public health of ficials. The 2013- 2016 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa was the most widespread outbreak of Ebola virus disease in history (WHO Ebola Response Team, N Engl J Med, 2014). This outbreak reminds us once more of the urgent unmet medical need for an effect ive vaccine and antiviral treatment against Ebola virus. Recently, a vaccine appeared to provide protection against the virus two years after injection (Huttner et al. Lancet 2018). A number of small molecule including GS -5734, brincidofovir (B CV, CMX001) and favipiravir are being evaluated for their clinical safety and efficacy. Finally, biological sciences are being revolutionized by big data, new genome sequencing and imaging technology. The antiviral field is no exception to this revolution. New generation sequencing is changing the way we recognize and diagnose the emergence of drug -resistance and prevent treatment failure. Genomics and proteomics are helping the identification of host factors as new targets for drug development and cryo -electron microscopy and tomography offer unprecedented, high -resolution images of virus particles. The future looks promising. With a surmounting number of scientific meetings and conferences, increasing budget difficulties for many academic and biotech labo ratories and a complex economic environment, ISAR recognized the need to optimize it resources. The Society must maintain its financial health, make strong efforts for ICAR to be economically feasible and at the same time encourage participation from all stakeholders. A new Conference Organizer was hired to run the 30 th and future conferences with the hope of optimizing our costs and improve efficiency. The ISAR finance committee took on the challenge of seeking advice and making decisions on how to inves t and optimize its reserve funds. Past presidents, the current leadership, a number of volunteers provided input, and a number of investment decisions were taken. Careful observation of economic markets and wise decision -making should allow the Society to count with financial health and security for the future. Additionally, strong efforts were made to keep expenditures at bay and make the conference a financially viable experience without compromising the scientific program and the participation of studen ts, postdocs and young investigators. The Society has already recognized the need to promote and encourage the participation of women in science and the Women in Science Roundtable has been running for some years with excellent appreciation from ICAR parti cipants. In 2017, we created the ISAR Women in Science Award to recognize woman scientists who have made outstanding contributions to the field of antiviral research. This award will now be one of the four ISAR awards of excellence given annually at ICAR . We hope this award will endure until there is no further need to highlight the dedication of women in science based on gender but on equality, scientific merit and excellence alone. The way people communicate and exchange information has changed dramati cally and so ISAR -ICAR needs also to revamp its communication strategy. During my tenure as President we recognized the need to modernize our communication structure to increase ICAR attendance and ISAR membership. A decision has been taken to create a new Communication and Outreach committee (COC) that will oversee the way we contact and communicate with the membership, stakeholders, ICAR participants and the public in general. The former Publications, Website and Membership committees will now merge into the COC. At the same time, professionals in the communication business should provide advice and guidance. Additionally, the Society will now actively promote the organizing of the ISAR webinars with a specific subcommittee and budget. We hope our decision s will contribute to the growth of ISAR and to the dissemination of science. Jos\u00e9 Est\u00e9 10 The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade 2. ISAR Awards for Outstanding Contributions Introduction Over its three decades, the International Society for Antiviral Research has established a variety of awards to recognize outstanding contributions. Most of these have been discussed in the previous decade summaries and are available on the Society's website, so they will be covered here in a more abbreviated form. It was recognized early that outstanding contr ibutions to the area should be recognized, not only at the senior investigator level, but also for younger scientists. The Society had the wonderful good fortune to have luminaries in the area as loyal and enthusiastic supporters and participants in the m eetings, and it was a popular decision in each case to set up awards that honor these people and establish criteria that reflect the character and contributions of these scientists. The initial two such awards were the Gertrude B. Elion Memorial Lecture A ward and the William H. Prusoff Young Investigator Award. More recently, the Anton \u00edn Hol \u00fd Memorial Award has been added to this prestigious list. And finally, the first Women i n Science Award was given in 2017, and it is intended to be an annual award that will be included in the next decade booklet. Gertrude B. Elion Memorial Lecture Award From the beginnings of the Society, Gertrude (Trudy) Elion was an important participa nt in the meetings, and was very active both at the sessions and in conversations with scientists of all ages, expertises , and affiliations. Her presence and support were important early as the Society and its International Conference on Antiviral Research became established, and she continued to participate through the rest of her life. Trudy Elion, jointly with George H. Hitchings and Sir James Black, was awarded the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for work on drug discovery. Her work over t he years involved a large number of drugs, and as her career unfolded, it became somewhat more focused on antiviral drugs, including acyclovir and AZT, to name two. Even after her retirement in 1983 she continued to be involved in drug discovery research at Burroughs Wellcome as a Scientist Emeritus and Consultant. At the meetings she was interested in all the research that was being presented and discussed, and anyone at the meeting could start up a conversation with her about the field or their own work . Trudy passed away in early 1999 at age 81, and later that year efforts by many scientists connected with the Society resulted in the establishment of the award at the Jerusalem ICAR meeting. The first Elion Award was presented at the 2000 ICAR meeting, which was held in Baltimore, Maryland. The award has been supported by Glaxo Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) up until 2017. The Award criteria are multifaceted. The award is given to an outstanding senior scientist of international stature, either in an tiviral research or in a scientific field that is connected to it. Awardees have not only scientific preeminence, but also embody some or many of the characteristics of Trudy Elion, which include: a genuine love of science, a character that engenders bot h respect and admiration, a reputation for scientific integrity, and approachability for scientists of all ages. The Elion award winners for the third decade are shown in Table 2.1. A look at the winners makes it clear that the Society embraces contributions from all relevant scientific disciplines, and any type of organization. The winners range from chemists to clinicians, and the affiliations are organizations from academia, indus try, and research institutes. The same diversity of award winners can be seen in the first two decades, as well. Chemists such as Karl Hofstetler and Michael Sofia have made major contributions in the construction of potential drugs, and of course in the drug discovery cycle where structural modifications are made in response to the biological activities and toxicities of molecules. Biologists, biochemists, virologists, and pharmacologists, which include Jan Balzarini, Karen Biron, Bo Oberg, Earl Kern, J ohn Drach, and Philip Furman, have been instrumental in developing the scope and limitations of the activity of potential new drugs, and in interfacing with both chemists and clinicians. Finally, clinicians such as Douglas Richman have been critical in th e establishment of favorable dose regimens in humans to maximize antiviral effects and minimize toxicities of drugs on their way to approval and afterwards, as well. The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade 11 The Elion Award gives the Society the opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate the legion of accomplishments by the scientists on the above list. All of them embody of the spirit and character of Trudy Elion in a variety of ways. Table 2.1. Gertrude B.

William Prusoff Young Investigator Award William (Bill) Prusoff, trained as a pharmacol ogist, was involved in antiviral research and drug discovery from the early days of antiviral drug development, and was responsible for one of the earliest approved drugs, idoxuridine for the treatment of topical herpesvirus infections. Along with his col laborator at Yale University, Tai - shun Lin, he was also responsible for one of the first anti -HIV drugs, stavudine . Stavudine was initially synthesized 12 The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade as a potential anti -cancer drug by Jerome Horwitz at the Michigan Cancer Foundation (now the Karmanos I nstitute). Horwitz similarly synthesized zidovudine (AZT ), another of the initial anti- HIV treatments discovered and advanced to FDA approval by Burroughs Wellcome. Bill Prusoff became well known for his efforts in the antiviral area, and was a speaker at conferences around the world. He was a strong supporter of the International Society for Antiviral Research from its inception and an enthusiastic regular attendee of the Inter national Conference on Antiviral Research. He was known to everyone and appreciated by all who knew him. One of his obvious attributes was the spirit of a young scientist, which he kept throughout his life. At one of the meetings he quipped that his spi rit was in its 30's but his body in the hundreds! He not only mentored many young scientists, but was highly supportive of young scientists around the world. In recognition of his efforts, Bristol -Myers Squibb endowed the Young Investigator Award, which has been presented at each ICAR meeting beginning in 2001. Bill had a positive attitude, a light heart, and a commitment to the development of new drugs that would help mankind. His success in that regard speaks for itself. Bill passed away in 2011at ag e 90, and was able to enjoy a decade of interacting with the winners of the Prusoff Award. The award is given to an outstanding young scientist, not older than 45 years of age, who has demonstrated dedication, excellence and achievement in any field related to antiviral research, from basic science through clinical evaluations, and who has the potential for continuing contributions to the field and to society in general. The award is designed to recognize outstanding young scientists who have not yet rea ched their peak scientific maturity, but are well on the way. The Prusoff award winners for the third decade are shown in Table 2.2. A look at the scientific accomplishments of this group of awardees makes it clear that they were outstanding young scient ist pursuing an impressive diversity of directions related to antiviral research and drug discovery. Again, the international character of the award is obvious, and winners through the years have continued on to make impressive scientific accomplishments. Anton \u00edn Hol \u00fd Memorial Award Anton\u00ed n (Tony) Hol \u00fd was an innovative and outstanding che mist from the Czech Republic. He became well known for his work in the area of nucleosides, and he did pioneering research on a variety of different nucleoside classes. He is best known for his preparation of the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates that have become anti-HIV and anti -HBV drugs through his collaboration with Erik De Clercq of the Rega Institute and through the efforts of the outstanding scientists at Gilead S ciences led by John Martin. Tony and Erik worked together for many years, and became revered personalities in antiviral circles around the world. That Tony was able to achieve this recognition coming from the Czech Republic through many years when the co untry was behind the Iron Curtain makes it all the more remarkable. Tony's scientific impact goes far beyond the phosphonates, however, and he has made innovative contributions in many other directions. Tony passed away at age 75 in 2012. In recognition of his many achievements, Gilead Sciences established the Anton \u00edn Hol \u00fd Memorial Award, which was first presented in 2014. The award is presented to a scientist working the field of medicinal chemistry, a senior scientist of international st ature who has made innovative contributions that have had an impact on antiviral drug discovery and/or development. The awardee is to have had a career -long impact on medicinal chemistry and antiviral research as evidenced by publications, patents, presen tations, and other similar criteria. The Hol\u00fd award winners during the third decade are shown in Table 2.3. All of the winners are internationally known and outstanding chemists involved in research relating to medicinal chemistry. They have contributed to a number of the drugs that are now approved as antiviral agents, and represent in outstanding fashion the impact that medicinal chemistry can have on human disease treatment.

Yang (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA) by Rhonda Cardin, chair of the WIS committee , at the 30th ICAR, Atlanta, GA, USA, 2017. Priscilla's lecture title: Small molecule inhibitors of viral entry inspired by the humoral immune response to viral infection. The WIS Award has become an annual event. Special Award of Thanks Joe Colacino (then ISAR President) presented the award to Roger Ptak during the ISAR Board Meeting held on May 8th, 2011 in Sofia, Bulgaria, 2011. This was a special award of thanks for his fund- raising. This may seem to have been a simple occasion but ISAR owe d him a very big vote of thanks for all that he had done, and continues to do. Put simply, ICAR could not have continued without his input. The Plaque states: Roger Ptak Chair of the ISAR Finance Committee For Your Professionalism and Motivation. Thank You for Working Behind the Scenes to Ensure ICAR's Success ISAR Service to the Society Award Occasionally the Society has chosen to honor a member for service to the Society well above and beyond what is expected. Over its first two decades of existence, ISAR has given only two such awards, to George Galasso and Earl Kern. During the third decad e, one such award was made, to Erik De Clercq of the Rega Institute for Medical Research in Leuven, Belgium, in recognition of his continued dedication, support and service to the Society and its members. This rare award was presented by then president Jo e Colacino to Dr. Erik De Clercq at the 25 th anniversary meeting in Sapporo, Japan in April 2012. Erik treated the audience to a series of entertaining and interesting reminiscences spanning his career and all with a link to Japan. John A. (Jack) Secrist III The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade 15 3. The Continued Growth and Importance of Antiviral Drug Discovery Drugs that can cure millions of people worldwide who have hepatitis C virus infections? Therapies that have virtually eliminated AIDS and turned HIV infection into a chronic, but highly suppressed disease, enabling many more people to live normal lives? All in a single tablet that needs to be taken only once a day? Antivirals that act by mechanisms previously unknown? Yes! This and more have occurred during the thi rd decade of the International Society for Antiviral Research (ISAR). We have witnessed a continuation of basic and applied studies that resulted in an ongoing stream of drugs to treat viral diseases. ISAR members and other scientists, clinicians, and administrators from academia, government, industry, and research institutes combined their talents and hard work to bring forth many new antiviral drugs, nearly 30 of which were approved for human use by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), see Table 3.1. There were additional approvals by regulatory agencies in Europe and Japan, some of which were later included in combinations approved by the FDA and are included in Table 3.1. Work that occurred during the first two decades of ISAR and pre ceding years initially concentrated on drugs to treat herpesvirus infections and acute infections such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and hepatitis B. While these efforts were ongoing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was recognized as th e cause of the then developing acquired immunodeficiency disease syndrome (AIDS) pandemic. This led to expanded and shifting efforts to develop drugs to treat HIV infections. At the same time hepatitis B and C infections were not ignored and some progress wa s made. These developments are summarized and discussed in the booklet The International Society for Antiviral Research: The Second Decade . As the third decade of ISAR began and resistance to earlier HIV drugs emerged, expanded efforts were made against this virus. Likewise as the enormity of the problem of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was recognized, this virus received expanded attention. (The World Health Organization estimates that 2- 3% of the world's population is infected with HCV.) The successful expanded work and the development of drugs to treat HCV infections was possible in no small part due to the development of in vitro models of the virus. Other viruses were not ignored and drugs with new mechanisms of action such as letermov ir to treat cytomegalovirus infections were found. Great progress also has been made in understanding and improving the pharmacokinetics of many drugs, especially those to treat HIV, HBV, and HCV infections. Although many early drugs were effective, they required patients to take multiple tablets or capsules two, three, or more times per day. Almost predictably , this resulted in poor patient acceptance of therapies and resulted in the emergence of drug -resistant viruses and disease relapses. The develop ment and use of prodrugs and combinations with them has resulted in therapies that are much more acceptable to patients, often requiring only the administration of a single table or capsule once a day! The drugs given approval by the United States Food & D rug Administration (FDA) during I SAR's third decade are shown in Table 3.1. For an explanation for the few additional drugs, please see footnote. Human i mmunodeficiency virus Great progress has been made in the treatment of HIV infections and the prevention of AIDS. As shown in Table 3.1, 13 new drugs were approved by the FDA between 2007 and 2018 to treat HIV infection. All but five of these are combinations of drugs that ac t by different, synergistic mechanisms. Of the five single active- ingredient drugs, four were approved by 2011. One of these (raltegravir) acts by a mechanism not previously available, inhibition of HIV integrase, which is the enzyme responsible for integrating HIV proviral DNA into host DNA. The mechanisms of the other three were similar to those found in previous drugs. Namely maraviroc acts by antagonism of the binding of human chemokine receptor CCR5 present on CD4 +T-cells to HIV -1 gp120 protein thereby preventing HIV binding and infection. The other two drugs are second -generation non- nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI's). They prevent the replication of the HIV genome by binding to reverse 16 The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade transcriptase at a position separate from the active site of the enzyme. They have the advantage that they are active against HIV that has become resistant to first generation NNRTI's such as nevirapine. Three of these four drugs typically are administered twice a day but better pharmacokinetic s permitted rilpivirine to be administered only once a day. Although approved as single active ingredient drugs, predictably all of these most often are used in combination with other HIV drugs. The fifth single -ingredient drug approved recently in 2018, ibalizumab (Trogarzo\u00ae \u00ae), is the first HIV therapy approved in 10 years that has a new mechanism of action; it can be effective in difficult- to-treat patients with limited options. It is a monoclonal antibody that binds to host cell -surface glycoprotein CD4 found on immune cells to protect them from HIV adherence and absorption. The majority of FDA approved drugs to treat HIV infection in this time period are fixed- dose combinations of two to four drugs. Typically they include some combination of a nucle oside integrase inhibitor. The major reasons for these combinations are to utilize different mechanisms of action to greatly reduce the incidence of HI V resistant to any one drug and to obtain synergistic antiviral effects. Combination is especially important with NNRTI's because resistance to their antiviral effect develops more readily than to other inhibitors. The use of two NRTI's that inhibit the catalytic site, or a NRTI with a NNRTI , to inhibit reverse transcriptase at two different loci , have proven to be effective combinations. Some combination drugs include a compound devoid of antiviral activity, cobicistat. It is a pharmacokinetic enhancer and is included because it inhibits the activity of a cytochrome P450 isoenzyme found in human liver. This enzyme is responsible for the metabolism and inactivation of several antiviral drugs, therefore its inhibition increases the duration and extent of the activity of anti- HIV drugs used in the combination. Table 3.1 provides details on the combination drugs. An important advance in drug design utilized in both single -ingredient and combination drugs was the introduction of prodrugs. These analogs of active compounds either circumvent a step needed in the metabolic activation of a drug from an inactive form or significantly enhance the oral absorption of the drug, or both. Examples include TDF (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) and TAF (tenofovir alafe drug combinations, Complera \u00ae, Stribild\u00ae\u00ae, Genvoya\u00ae, and Biktarvy\u00ae. Special problems exist in the design and production of all the combination drugs. These involve not only the therapeutic challenges of finding the best combination of ingredients and dosages for each component, but also the pharmaceutical challenge of how to combine different compounds into a single capsule or tablet. Problems such as different rates of dissolution and solubility in different parts of the gastro -intestinal tract must be addressed. Equally important is how to prevent chemical reactions am ong the ingredients in the dose form itself so that the combination drug can go from manufacturer to pharmacy to patient without degradation. These challenges have been overcome for all of the combination drugs approved by the FDA and listed in the Table 3.1. Hepatitis B virus Progress also has been made in the development of drugs to treat hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections (Table 3.1). The earlier discovery that hepatitis B virus utilized a reverse transcriptase as part of the process to replicate its DNA genome and produce infectious virus strongly suggested that reverse transcriptase inhibitors identified as drugs to treat HIV might inhibit HBV as well. This proved to be correct and a NRTI approved in 1995 for the treatment of HIV, lamivudine, was ap proved in 1998 for HBV treatment. Since that time two other NRTI's have been approved, telbivudine and tenofovir. These are more effective than the earlier HBV drugs and less likely to select drug -resistant virus strains. Telbivudine is unique among the NRTI's because its sugar moiety is the \"unnatural\" L -ribose, not D -ribose found in naturally- occurring nucleosides and in the other NRTI's. Two prodrugs of tenofovir have been approved Viread\u00ae (TDF) and Vemlidy \u00ae (TAF) . Both need to be taken only once a day but Vemlidy\u00ae proved as active but with a superior safety profile to the older prodrug, Viread\u00ae . Even though great progress has been made in highly suppressing HBV in virtually all patients, only a relatively few patients achieve a f unctional cure. The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade 17 Hepatitis C Virus Of all the antivirals discussed herein, the greatest progress has been made in the development of drugs to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. In the time frame of the third decade of ISAR, we have gone from the use of interferon, usually with ribav irin, which produced incomplete results with adverse effects, to much safer drugs that now result in cures. This has come about as the result of the development of a number of new single -ingredient and combination drugs. Key to the development of these d rugs was the establishment of in vitro models of HCV replication, understanding how the virus replicates, and the identification of key non- structural proteins essential for that replication. Three such proteins have been utilized successfully as targets for the new drugs. Their functions were initially unknown other than they were not part of the virus structure and consequently were simply referred to as non- structural proteins. Subsequent research identified their roles in viral replication which are as follows: ( i) non-structural protein 3 -4A (NS3 -4A) is the primary viral protease needed to cleave a viral poly protein into active proteins needed for viral function and to inhibit the production of host interferon, (ii) NS5A is essential for HCV RNA replication, but its precise role(s) in the process are poorly understood, and ( iii) NS5B is the RNA- dependent RNA polymerase needed to replicate the viral RNA genome. The first partially successful new HCV drugs had a single active ingredient. Boceprevir , telaprevir, and simeprevir are older inhibitors of the viral protease. A more recent single- ingredient drug, daclatasvir, inhibits the NS5A protein. All these drugs we re initially used in combination with interferon, usually with ribavirin and sometime s with the older drugs. Sofosbuvir is a nucleoside inhibitor of the RNA polymerase (NRPI) and is still the only NRPI with FDA approval. It has a high genetic barrier to viral resistance so that it is used without interferon. Although sofosbuvir was initi ally used alone, it was closely followed by combination with a NS5A inhibitor (ledipasvir) to give the highly effective drug Harvoni \u00ae (Table 3.1). A problem with developing drugs to treat HCV is that this virus has six major strains (genotypes) and some drugs are active against one genotype but not others. The first protease inhibitors boceprevir, telaprevir, and simeprevir are active only against genotype 1, which is the most common strain in the United States. Types 1 -3 are worldwide with 4 and 5 prima rily in Africa and 6 in Asia. Because of relatively high HCV infection rates in China and other sites in Asia, drugs active against only type 1 were inadequate for the worldwide pandemic. This led to the successful development of drugs active against all genotypes (see Epclusa\u00ae and Vosevi\u00ae, below). Of the other single -ingredient drugs the polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir is more broadly active, it is effective against types 1 - 4 whereas daclatasvir is active against type 3. These two often are used toget her b ut not in a single dose form. Combination dose -form drugs have been the most successful against all strains including genotype 1. For example Viekira Pak\u00ae and Harvoni\u00ae combine four and two separate drugs, respectively , that act by different mechanis ms (Table 3.1) to give high efficacy against genotype 1. Viekira Pak\u00ae is unusual in that it contains ritonavir, a drug initially developed to treat HIV. But its role in this combination is as an inhibitor of a liver cytochrome P450 enzyme and thereby to prevent the rapid metabolism of the ingredients active against HCV. Technivie\u00ae, another combination with ritonavir, and Zepatier\u00ae provide coverage against genotype 4 but it was not until recently that drug combinations were achieved and approved to treat a ll genotypes, including type 6. Epclusa, a combination of sofosbuvir and a NS5A inhibitor (Table 3. 1) was approved in 2016 and gave cure rates ~95% for all genotypes. Addition of a protease inhibitor gave the combination named Vosevi\u00ae; this combination inhibits all three of the HCV target enzymes mentioned above. In contrast, Mavyret\u00ae combines inhibitors of only the protease and the NS5A protein. Both have the benefit of the components being combined into a single table that is taken only once per day. Vosevi\u00ae probably approaches the ideal HCV drug that can cure virtually all HCV patients. It comes as a single tablet taken once per day for no more than 12 weeks to cure a chronic viral infection in nearly all patients. 18 The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade Influenza viruses There has been but one new drug approved in the United States to treat influenza during ISAR's third decade. Rapivab\u00ae (peramivir injection) has a mechanism similar to the influenza drugs Tamiflu\u00ae (oseltamivir) and Relenza\u00ae (zanamivir) approved in 1999, na mely inhibition of the viral neuraminidase. It has the advantage of being administered as a single dose but it must be given as an intravenous solution. There are exciting new developments and a new mechanism of action with influenza drugs, but none have yet been approved for use in the United States. Xofluza\u00ae (baloxavir marboxil) was very recently approved in Japan and is under review by the FDA. It acts via a new mechanism by inhibiting a process called viral \"cap -snatching\". The endonuclease portion of the viral RNA polymerase removes the 5\u00b4 -terminus from cellular messenger RNA's (mRNA's) to utilize them in the biosynthesis of viral mRNA's. Inhibition of this process prevents viral replication at a point prior to where the neuraminidase inhibitors ac t. Initial studies indicate that only a single dose of the drug may be needed to treat influenza. Other drugs such as favipiravir and pimodivir also target influenza RNA polymerase but are in earlier stages of development or FDA review. Human p apilloma viruses In 2006 the FDA approved the first topical botanical as an antiviral drug to treat genital warts. Veregen is a partially purified fraction of a water extract of green tea leaves. It is a mixture of catechins and other green tea components. Catec hins are bioflavonoids, polyphenols and antioxidants with evidence of anti -tumor activity and immune stimulation - it does not appear to have specific anti -viral activity . Veregen is specifically indicated for the topical treatment of external genital and perianal warts in immunocompetent adults. It is supplied as an ointment for topical administration. Herpesviruses In contrast to the many drugs that were developed and approved in the first two decades of the ISAR to treat various herpesvirus infections , only two were approved in the third decade of our society. One of these approvals was for a new dose form of the first safe and effect herpes antiviral drug, acyclovir. In 2013 the new dose form named Sitavig \u00ae was approved for recurrent herpes labialis, cold sores caused by herpes simplex virus type 1. It is unique because of its dose form. It contains acyclovir in a buccal tablet containing a proprietary muco -adhesive. One buccal tablet is applied as a single dose to the upper gum region and held in place with slight pressure for 30 seconds to ensure adhesion and dissolution. The tablet should be applied within one hour after the onset of symptoms and before the appearance of any signs of lesions. Unlike Sitavig \u00ae that is only a new dose form of an old drug, the approval of Prevymis\u00ae (letermovir) in 2017 marked the availability of a new drug to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections for the first time since the approval of fomivirsen in 1998. Importantly it heralded the introduction of a drug that a cts by a new and unique mechanism. Letermovir acts by inhibition of the CMV \"terminase\", the three -protein complex responsible for the cleavage of concatemeric viral DNA into genome -length segments and its packaging into virions. Although it has a simila r mode of action to experimental benzimidazole nucleosides, it is not a nucleoside but a highly substituted quinazoline analog. It is indicated for prophylaxis of CMV infection and disease in patients that receive a CMV -seropositive allogeneic hematopoiet ic stem cell transplant. It is available as a tablet for once per day oral administration and as a solution for intravenous injection. The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade 19 Table 3.1.

There also has been activity to develop drugs to counter possible bioterrorism threats using smallpox virus or drug- resistant mutants of other viruses. Because drugs specific for infections caused by these viruses have not been approved by the FDA and due to the conciseness of this overview, the reader must look elsewhere for details, such as the ICAR reports (www.isar -icar.com). John C. Drach The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade 23 4. The early days of Antiviral Research The 30th ICAR, in 2017, marked the 40th anniversary of the publication (Elion et al., 1977) describing the first truly selective antiviral agent. Acyclovir was the first antiviral drug which combined good activity with such an excellent safety profile that it still stands as the benchmark for all other antiviral drugs, even 40 years later. Acyclovir, and its prodrug valac yclovir, are still widely used worldwide. It was time for the antiviral field to have its own dedicated journal, Antiviral Research (AVR, 1981), and its own international meeting (Rotterdam, 1985) at which an international society was proposed. The International Society of Antiviral Research (ISAR ) was born shortly thereafter (1987), organizing its first conference at Williamsburg in 1988 (called the 2 nd ICAR, since the Rotterdam meeting, although not called as such, was considered to be the \"the first\" ICAR). Ever since, AVR and ISAR have remained closely inter -linked, each supporting the other. As ICAR enters its fourth decade, increasing numbers of attendees were born well after the 1980s. Now, it is well known that antiviral drugs, albeit still only a small number, have transformed millions of l ives. Before acyclovir, the possibility of safe, effective antiviral drugs was doubted. This introduction illustrates the vision that held a small band of researches together, encouraging each other to push against an apparent glass ceiling. The year 1981 marked the appearance of the first issue of the new journal, Antiviral Research (AVR), but, ironically, it also marked the birth of the term AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). This disease would subsequently, in 1983, be identified as a viral dis ease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, name chosen in 1987), which would later launch worldwide attempts to curb the infection by antiviral (i.e. anti -HIV) agents. For AVR, the advent of HIV and the anti -HIV agents meant an enormous boost. Vaccination has since the inception of AVR been hailed as the primary measure to combat viral infections in animals and humans, but while the worldwide eradication of smallpox has been rightfully attributed, to a great extent, to a global vaccination campai gn, for other viral infections, including poliomyelitis, the final extinction has still not been achieved. Yet, for polio, two effective vaccines have been available for many years: the inactivated, injectable \"Salk\" vaccine and the oral, live \"Sabin\" vaccine. Other virus infections, such as yellow fever and measles, still occur despite the presence of effective vaccination measures, and for other widely spread virus infections no vaccines have (so far) been developed (Dengue)* or are even envisaged (HIV). For hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papilloma virus (HPV), which were already considered as possible candidates for vaccination in our inaugural Editorial in 1981, effective vaccines have in the meantime arisen. For hepatitis C virus (HCV), vaccination m ay, given the success of the direct -acting antivirals (DAAs), no longer be needed, and for influenza A and B, a virtual \"status quo\" has been reached over the past few decades in that the recommended (preventive) approach is based upon annual vaccination w ith a mix of inactivated influenza A and B virus strains which have to be adjusted yearly according to those strains that are circulating. In 1981 we anticipated that 'the novel forms of bioengineering' would have a strong impact on the design and manufact ure of viral vaccines. We did not have to wait long to see fulfillment of this prediction: the carrier serum -derived vaccine made available in the early 1980s was soon replaced by a formulation containing pure viral proteins produced by recombinant technol ogy. Today vaccine research and development without deployment of molecular biology has become unthinkable. Viral strain identification and characterization by genome sequencing (influenza strains), rapid isolation of emerging viruses (SARS and MERS), moni toring of molecular consistency of classical attenuated vaccines (Sabin's polio vaccine) are examples of the profound transformation that vaccine technology has undergone. *Footnote: For Dengue, a vaccine (Dengvaxia\u00ae) has been approved in some countries. 24 The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade We also foresaw an exponential increase in our knowledge of the immune defense mechanisms and we expressed the hope that this would open avenues towards 'new forms of antiviral therapy or prophylaxis'. Today our insight in the network of humoral factors, c ellular receptors and ligands of the immune system has indeed become infinitely more rich and detailed. But, unfortunately, we have also learned that viruses (e.g. herpes viruses, HIV) have more ways to use this network's intricacy for their own profit tha n we have means to use them to combat infection. While interferon, that just had been cloned in 1980, was considered to be a viable approach for the treatment of varying viral infections, its practical use was finally confined to its application (in its p egylated form), combined with ribavirin, in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. This combination would remain the standard of care (SOC) till 2011, then continued but with the new DAAs added. With the advent of sofosbuvir in December 2013, the combination of peginterferon with ribavirin would become obsolete. The positive message is that interferon has been of some help for some time, and that we now have both Type I interferons in pegylated formulations, generally assumed to have a more favorable tissue distributions than the 'naked' forms. Moreover, we know that interferon -alpha has definite potential for the treatment of virus infections, in particular those with a protracted course. Therefore, we feel happy to have these preparations on the shelf, read y for use against unexpected emergence of new viruses or in special cases where treatment with antivirals would appear to need some adjuvant. The use of serotherapy, i.e. the injection of immunoglobulins, considered to be rather unsuccessful in 1981, has r emained so over the past few decades, one exception being the monoclonal antibodies tailored for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. Back in 1981 there were very few antiviral drugs around. These were idoxuridine (IDU) and triflu ridine (trifluorothymidine, TFT), launched in 1962 and 1964, respectively, for the topical treatment of herpetic eye infections (i.e. herpetic keratitis). In 1964 amantadine had been discovered as an anti -influenza A agent, but it would never receive wide acceptance for the treatment of influenza, also because it quickly led to the emergence of resistance. Ribavirin was discovered in 1972, and for all the following years it was searching for its niche, which it finally found, in combination with peginterfer on, in the treatment of hepatitis C. In 1976, Whitley and his colleagues reported the use of the first antiviral (vidarabine) ever to be administered systemically in the treatment of varicella -zoster virus (VZV) infections, i.e. herpes zoster. Already announced in our Editorial of 1981 were bromovinyldeoxyuridine and acycloguanosine (in the Editorial misspelled as \"acylcloguanosine\"). Acycloguanosine would be worldwide known as acyclovir for the (systemic and topical) treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, and (oral) for herpes zoster (shingles). Oral bromovinyldeoxyuridine (BVDU) would become licensed in many countries for the treatment of herpes zoster. What in 1981 at the time of our Editorial could not be anticipated was the advent of HIV, a nd the explosion of anti -HIV agents it would lead to. Roughly, half of the current armamentarium for the treatment of viral infections exists of drugs effective against HIV (De Clercq & Li, 2016). Back in 1981 we speculated about the likelihood that specif ic antiviral substances may originate from \" the discovery and extensive characterization of various virus- encoded enzymes\". Little did we knew at that time of the discovery of HCV (in 1989), which would reveal the existence of a number of virus -encoded proteins that would serve as the target(s) for a whole new generation of antiviral agents, of the DAAs (Li & De Clercq, 2017), which would revolutionize the treatment of hepatitis C and ensure a cure for this dreadful viral disease.

Keeping to the founding aim of ISAR, to present high quality science , across a broad spectrum of antiviral research , at ICAR. Introduction During the first few years following the foundation of ISAR, ICAR was the international meeting which was solely focused on antiviral research. By the end of the first decade, and even m ore so at the end of the second decade, ISAR felt the effects of competition from other meetings, some focused on a particular virus, some broad ranging. This report aims to illustrate how many ISAR members, particularly the Program Committee, have worked tirelessly to bring us ICARs filled with a wide spectrum of research i n several dimensions, from basic virology to clinical trials, from chemistry to biology, from technology to legal, etc. Undoubtedly, this strategy has helped ISAR remain at the forefront of antiviral research. Generally, the lectures, given by the recipients of the major awards, have set a high standard (see section 2). The keynote and plenary lectures (see Table 5.1) have sometimes been chosen to present complementary information on a p articular virus but more generally have been selected to cover different viruses. The mini - symposia (Table 5.2) may be repeated from one year to another (e.g. clinical, emerging viruses) but often focus on new areas each ICAR. Looking through the tables, o ne can see the variety of speakers (academ ia, industry) and their topics. Rather than attempt to give a summary of each lecture, I have selected topics, mainly for their continuing interest through the years. Generally, I have not included examples focusing on early research or on antivirals which have been replaced by newer compounds. These selected topics were reported previously either in the ISAR News or the ICAR meeting reports (www.isar -icar.com). The Poster sessions have been a feature of ICARs throughout the three decades. Over the years, there has been an enormous spectrum of topics presented by scientists of all ages and backgrounds. To further illustrate the range of topics presented at ICAR, T able 5.3 includes the First P rize winners together with the topic s presented. Highlights from Keynote and Plenary lectures (Table 5.1) 21st ICAR, 2008, Montreal I remember feeling privileged to hear Takaji Wakita describing the first successful replica tion of HCV in cell culture in 2005. It is remarkable that HCV, which produces more virus (1012 virions/day) in patients than any other virus, has presented such a challenge to replicate in cell culture. 22nd ICAR, 2009, Miami Beach Christopher Lipinski i s well known for his 'rule of five' (see below), which actually has only four rules! These were devised having considered 7,483 named drugs. If a candidate compound has any one of these undesirable attributes, consider carefully if it should be progressed. If it has more than one of these properties, it is unwise to progress. The fifth rule might be that there are always exceptions, for example, if the compound is a substrate for a natural transporter.

TheInternational ForAntiviral Research International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade 33 23rd ICAR, 2010 , San Francisco John Martin (a previous ISAR President and an Elion awardee) vividly illustrated the gain in patient life - style when fixed -dose combination pills were introduced, from many pills taken throughout the day to a single pill once daily. [EFV ]/FTC/ TDF) in 2006, had a great impact. At that time i n the USA, >85% of patients were taking Truvada or AtriplaR . 24th ICAR, 2011 , Sofia The keynote and plenary lectures all reported on research at early stages, Albert (ADME) Osterhaus discussed ongoing work with HIV, human metapneumonia virus (although widespread, discovered only in 2001), monkeypox, measles, West Nile virus and Chikunguny a virus, (detected in Italy in 2007). Raina Fichorova described the failures and limited progress of vaginal microbicides in preventing the spread of HIV. Ralf Bartenschlager gave a good summary of the HCV targets for antiviral compounds. As HCV has 6 or 7 genotypes, more than 100 subtypes and each existing as quasispecies, it presents a daunting challenge to any antiviral drug therapy. Yet with no means of viral latency or integration, therapy leading to a sustained virological response (SVR) has the poten tial for a complete cure. Esteban Domingo considered lethal mutagenesis strategies for those viruses which exist as quasispecies. If the copying fidelity was to become too low, then no viable progeny would be formed. 25th ICAR, 2012 , Sapporo Hiroaki Mits uya reported on n ew RT inhibitors being developed, for example, festinavir University, USA, licensed to Oncolys BioPharma , a Japanese company, which progressed festinavir to Phase I trials and is now being developed by Bristol -Myers Squibb. It is a once daily RT inhibitor which is active against viruses resistant to both tenofovir and abacavir. 26th ICAR, 2013 , San Francisc o Eva Harris described how dengue virus (DENV) has two mechanisms for entry into cells: via receptor attachment and via antibody. The latter mechanism explains how a previous infection can enhance disease progression - instead of antibody binding to the vi rion and leading it to its inactivation, the bound antibody gives the virus an additional route into Fc receptor -bearing target cells. She illustrated how this knowledge could be used in vaccine design. 27th ICAR, 2014 , Raleigh This is an example when two speakers (David Margolis and Myron Cohen) were asked to give complementary talks on HIV infections. David concluded that elimination of HIV from an individual was still a distant prospect. In contrast, Myron had encouraging news about the prospects for pr eventing HIV transmission. Most progress was being made with dapivirine rings containing TDF. These had been designed to stay in the vagina for a month. Phase III trials were ongoing. A long -acting HIV integrase inhibitor, GSK 1265744 (generally known as G SK 744), was administered i.m. in a Phase I trial which confirmed that the drug may be administered at 3 - month intervals. In the absence of a proven HIV vaccine , pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with drugs has become the most promising strategy to reduce H IV infection rates among high -risk populations. 34 The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade Also, in a trial which enrolled 1,763 HIV sero -discordant couples (couples that have one partn er who is HIV-infected and the other who is HIV -uninfected), successful anti-HIV therapy was very effective in preventing HIV transmission. 28th ICAR, 2015 , Rome Raffaele De Francesco and Michael Manns were asked to give complementary reports on the great advances recently achieved in drug therapies for HCV infections. There are now various IFN -free options for po tential HCV therapies. Although there are different combinations with efficacy against genotypes 1 and 4, only sofosbuvir (SOF)-containing regimens are active against all genotypes (1 -6), the best being SOF with daclatasvir. In clinical use, this combinati on (once daily for 12 -24 weeks) shows activity against genotypes 1 -4, but initial data indicate that this combination will be effective against genotypes 5 and 6. In Phase III trials, the combination of SOF with Gilead's new NS5A inhibitor tested at once -daily dosing for 8 -12 weeks against all genotypes. Other IFN -free combination are currently being tested in Phase II clinical trials aimed at developing what today is considered an aspirational regimen, once daily, single pill, 8 weeks, 1 00% SVR12 for all genotypes. Armand Sprecher gave a memorable lecture, to my knowledge unique for ICAR. In 2014, MSF's role in the current Ebola outbreak started on the 13th March with an alert from the Ministry of Health, Guinea asking for help with an outbreak in which an infection in 15 people had led to 9 deaths. On 18th March, a MSF team arrived in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou. Just 3 days later, the infection was identified as Ebola. On 23rd March, just 10 days after the initial alert, MSF opened their Ebola treatment unit (ETU) in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou. On 25th March, the Liberian Ministry of Health notified MSF of four Ebola deaths. The next day, MSF set up an ETU in Macenta which is in Guinea but close to the border with Liberia. The next day (27th March), four Ebola cases were identified in Conakry, Guinea. On 1st April, MSF opened their ETU in Conakry. By this time, MSF had sent 60 staff out into the field. About three weeks later (26th April), MSF opened their ETU in Liberia. To my mind, the speed of this response is truly im pressive. Of 5176 confirmed cases of Ebola infected patients being cared for in MSF centers, there were 2449 survivors. Although the epidemic has had a huge human cost, there is a great joy every time a survivor leaves to go home . Armand Sprecher's conclusion ''Let's not do this again\". 29th ICAR, 2016 , La Jolla Richard Scheuermann illustrated how the much improved viral genome sequencing has open up a new area of research - old questions can now be answered. Prior to 2004, only 60 complete influen za A genome sequences were known. As of 6th April 2016, a total of 31,460 complete influenza genome sequences were known, of these, 28,308 were for influenza A, nearly 20,000 of these being sequenced by JCVI. Using these large databases, it has been possib le to follow h ow adaptive immunity drives influenza A virus evolution during a pandemic and the identification of virulence determinants (causing paralysis) of enterovirus D68 during the outbreak in the USA (mid - August 2014 to mid -January 2015). Heinz Fel dmann described the ongoing efforts to improve the outcome of any future Ebola outbreak: strengthening public health, improving community awareness, negotiating cross -border co -operation and continuing international support. Although the rVSV -EBOV vaccine was deemed to be safe to use, there were unwelcome side effects - however , it was highly effective in preventing Ebola disease , apparently providing protection within 10 days in a ring vaccination trial (index case contacts and their contacts vaccinated). Two virus polymerase inhibitors may have useful efficacy. Favipiravir was tested in Guinea towards the end of this outbreak. The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade 35 There seemed to be a benefit to those patients who had low or moderate base line viral loads . GS-5734 was much more active than fav ipiravir against Ebola in a nonhuman primate model, but no clinical data were available. However, GS -5734 is a very promising drug for any future Ebola outbreak. We need to have adequate stockpiles of drugs and vaccine. This has been by far the worst Ebola outbreak but we now have some tools to limit any future Ebola outbreak. 30th ICAR, 2017 , Atlanta Ann Palmenberg explained how rhinovirus -C (RV -C) had remained \"hidden\" for 5 decades. It is widespread and associated with children who ha ve severe asthma. Preliminary information suggested an emergence of RV -C, from RV -A, about 3 -5,000 years ago . The receptor for RV -C is cadherin -3 (CDHR3). There are two variants , Tyr 529 which is the ancestral protein and Cys 529 which appears to be unique to our human race. However, the Cys 529 variant first appeared in modern humans a long time ago, being detected in some ancient modern -human remains which were discovered in Africa. The dates showed that Cys 529 was already present within the human population before the \"out o f Africa\" event, around 50,000 years ago , but this could not have been under evolutionary pressure from RV -C. The first study of genome -wide ancient DNA (~8500 -3000 years before present) was from Anatolian Neolithic farmers, who became Europe's first farme rs. Within Anatolian population, 25% had the Cys 529 variant, 75% had the Tyr 529 form. In samples from central Europe dating about 1000 years before present, the proportions had reversed (85% and 15%, respectively). In modern times, the majority of hum ans have both genes for the Cys 529 protein, ranging from 53% in Africa to 87% in Asia, with the Americas (75%) and Europe (68%) having intermediate values. Could it be that RV -C, having evolved , was putting pressure on human evolution? Pei-Yong Shi consid ered that lifetime immunity after a single dose is a feature that is critical for a successful Zika vaccine. He discovered that deleting a 10 -nucleotide section from the three prime untranslated region (3'UTR), (10-del ZIKV) gave a highly attenuated virus, perhaps suitable as a vaccine. He gave the results obtained in many tests for safety and efficacy . In pregnant mice, the vaccine prevented in utero transmission of Zika virus. In male mice, the vaccine prevented prolonged infection in testis and protected against testis damage. These studies have addressed two major concerns arising from clinical studies. This Zika vaccine may be one of only a few game - changing therapies described early during its evaluation at ICAR - I understand that, since the 2017 ICAR, this vaccine has been selected for progression. Highlights and comments on Mini -symposia (Table 5.2) 21st ICAR, 2008, Montreal Some mini -symposia, such as that on HI V targets, discussed early research options which did not lead to useful therapies. Likewise, some antiviral compounds, such as apricitabine (NRTI) seemed to be highly effective against HIV with a high genetic barrier to viral resistance and a good safety profile, but disappeared after several years of development. In contrast, tenofovir (TFV) was reported to be more effective against HBV than adefovir and it became the drug of choice for treating chronic HBV infections. Although not part of the Clinical s ymposium, the activity of ST-246 against poxviruses was reported. Plasma levels of ST -246, at 500 mg, suggested that once -a-day dosing should be possible. Comparing the monkey and human PKs, good activity against poxviruses in humans should be readily achi evable. ST -246 was well tolerated. We were to hear more of ST -246 in later ICARs. 36 The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade Table 5.2.

This was ICAR's introduction to NS5A as a drug target. Previous work had implicated domain I having a key role in viral RNA replication. Anothe r major drug target, not discussed here but well known, is the viral polymerase. In the Clinical session, there was an update on the efficacy of tenofovir against HBV infections. There were reports on various other less important drugs, for example a Phase I trial in healthy patients with CMX001 (hexadecyloxypropyl prodrug of cidofovir). 23rd ICAR, 2010 , San Francisco In the mini -symposium on viral resistance, there were reports on HIV, HCV and on improvements to the detection of resistance. Over the past decade, the proportion of HIV patients receiving three classes of drugs (nucleoside reverse transcriptase has increased . Having combination therapy, particularly when available as a single -pill therapy, had greatly reduced the problems of HIV resistance in the clinic. In clinical trials with HCV patients, resistance to PIs and NNRTIs occurs very quickly, within 3 -7 days. Whereas PIs and NNRTIs have varying activities against different HCV genotypes , NRTIs are active against all HCV genotypes . A clinical trial, tested th e combination of an NRTI (R7128, 1,000 mg twice daily) with a PI (R7227, 900 mg twice daily). Over a 14 day dosing period, the viral load fell by 4 -5 log 10 IU/ml. Virus resistance studies suggest ed that there was no resistance to R7128. The clinical sympo sium included updates on two HIV therapies apricitabine and a quad tablet, containing elvitegravir (EVG, 150 mg), emtricitabine (FTC, 200 mg), TDF (300 mg) and cobicistat (150 mg). CMX001 was being evaluated for prophylaxis or treatment of CMV, tenofovir in three year safety and efficacy study in chronic HBV and famciclovir (either as a single dose or twice in one day) in recurrent HSV infections. There was one novel therapy, a DNA vaccine derived from two plasmids corresponding to gB and pp65 proteins of CMV . The vaccine reduced various measures of CMV infection in transplant patients : the time to initial viral detection was prolonged, the duration of viremia was decreased, peak viral load was decreased and the viral load AUC was reduced by 40%. 24th ICAR, 2011 , Sofia The emerging diseases mini -symposium included talks on Japanese encephalitis, Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), the potential of RNA capping as a target for antivirals against (+)RNA viruses and the use of filovirus - virus like particles (VLPs) which offer a safe alternative to working with viruses such as Marburg and Ebola. The drug discovery mini -symposium included the compound which was to become the game -changer for HCV therapy. Michael Sofia (Pharmasset, USA) started his presentation with t he comment that, to his knowledge, there was no link between his surname and the site of this ICAR (Sofia, Bulgaria). He described the results from the Phase IIb clinical trials for HCV therapy using t he guanosine analogue, PSI-352938 , and the uridine nucleotide analogue, PSI -7977 , either alone or combined, treating for 14 days. All groups gave a good reduction in HCV load (approximately 5 log 10) but the viral load dropped slightly more rapidly with the combination therapy, the best seen so far in HCV c linical trials. As the combination of PSI -7977 and PSI-352938 is able to clear HCV in cell culture systems and shows promising preliminary human clinical results, it is hoped that further trials will show that it will result in SVRs in patients without usi ng IFN (see below). The clinical symposium included talks on three compounds which were to become approved drugs. 38 The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade CMX001 is a prodrug for cidofovir (see above) and has a plasma half -life of 6.5 days. It is being developed for therapy of the DNA viruses, a denovirus and HCMV, and as a biodefence against poxviruses. It is also active against papillomaviruses, which do not encode a viral DNA polymerase, but viral resistance maps to the viral protein, large T antigen (LTAg), which is required for viral DNA repl ication. The disoproxil fumarate (TDF), which is widely used in HIV therapy, mainly as part of the single -tablet regimen AtriplaR . TDF improves the oral bioavailability of TFV in plasma, but target ed delivery of TFV into cells could further enhance treatment efficacy, yet may reduce the risk of renal and bone effects by lowering the plasma concentrations of TFV. A series of amidate prodrugs of TFV was synthesized and GS monotherapy with GS -7340 (either 50 mg or 150 mg) was more effective than TDF (300 mg) in treatment -naive HIV -infected patients. Reduced systemic exposure is likely to reduce the risk of TDF -associated toxicities. As TDF is part of c ombination regimens used extensively as the backbone for HIV therapy, GS -7340 is well positioned to potentially replace TDF as the standard prodrug of TFV (see below) . AIC246 ( formerly ST -246, see above ) was initially discovered to be active against poxvirus . At this ICAR, the activity (EC 50 approximately 5 nM) was reported to be highly specific for HCMV, whilst not active against murine CMV. The dose -response curve is unusually steep, the EC 90 being approximately 7 nM. The mechanism of action is via inhibiting the HCMV terminase complex, consisting of UL56, UL89 and UL104, which cleaves HCMV progeny DNA into unit genome lengths as the viral DNA is packaged into virions. As there is no comparable human cell complex , there is potential for high selectiv ity. As current HCMV therapies all target the viral polymerase, no cross -resistance would be expected. Of 10 Phase I trials planned , 9 have been completed. 25th ICAR, 2012 , Sapporo The c linical symposium included an update on AIC246, then known as letermo vir. However, this session was notable for the presentation by Michael Sofia (Gilead Sciences Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA) on GS-7977 , formerly known as PSI -7997, a nucleotide prodrug for the treatment of HCV . The ELECTRON Phase IIb trial proved to be a game -changer for HCV therapy. T here were initially four groups, with a GS -7977 monotherapy -7977 monotherapy weeks. The first four all gave 100% SVR, the monotherapy gave 60% SVR. There were no virological breakthroughs. There were no safety issues. How many clinical trials give 100% cure rates? In another Phase IIb trial, GS -7977/RBV therapy (12 weeks ) compar ed treatment -na\u00efve patients to those previously non -responders to PEGIFN/RBV. Both groups had similar reductions in HCV RNA load, 100% of patients reaching the limit of detection (LOD) by 4 we eks and remaining below LOD to week 12. At four weeks after therapy, the proportions of patients achieving SVR were 10/10 and 1/9, respectively. Future studies in patients, who were previously non -responders, will evaluate longer treatment times and combin ations with other antivirals. The three m ini-symposi a (therapy of infections endemic to Japan and Asia , clinical development of antiviral agents and building a better clinical candidate: issues, strategies and tools) gave good summaries of the early resea rch in these areas. 26th ICAR, 2013 , San Francisco This ICAR opened with a full session on \" The legacy of Anton\u00edn (Tony) Hol y: Nucleotides in the treatment and prevention of chronic viral infections \", led by Erik De Clercq (Rega Institute, Belgium) and John Martin (Gilead The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade 39 Sciences, USA), both past presidents of ISAR. Erik described their 3 -way collaboration, Tony the chemist, Erik a medic and John with his industrial experience . Their collaboration was surely nurtured by their re gular attendance at ICAR - Erik showed a photograph of the three of them \"at work\" above the Rio Grande Gorge, New Mexico in 1995, when ICAR was in Santa Fe. It was tenofovir, in its various prodrug forms, that was to become a major success for treating HI V-infected patients. These collaborators also initiated work on a single -pill, once daily, regimen. This led to AtriplaR being approved in 2006 - a therapy which transformed patients' lives. The collaboration has had another major success, enabling HIV -infected patients anywhere to be treated with tenofovir through the Expanded Access Program established by Gilead. Both Tony and Erik waived their royalties for sales in countries with poor access to health care. Tenofovir (as TDF or TAF) has also become the treatment of choice for HBV -infected patients. For further information, see Erik's tribute below . The c linical symposium include d topics which appeared important at the time but have now been overtaken by newer therapies; drug candidates (HCV), a dual CCR 5/CCR2 antagonist and a single -tablet (HIV). In contrast, CMV resistance profile of CMX001 remains of interest ; the prior use of ganciclovir ( GCV ), which is most likely to lead to resistance mutations in the UL97 gene of CMV, will not compromise subsequent therapy with CMX001. In contrast, previous therapy with cidofovir ( CDV ), when dosage may be limited by toxicity, should be avoided. Instead, CMX001 should be used for patients failing on GCV therapy. Both mini -symposia, \" Chemistry: Strategies and tactics in drug design \" and \" Chemistry: Prodrugs as tools in drug discovery and development \" signal a shift towards including more chemistry at ICAR, inspired by Phil Furman who became president after the previous ICAR. Although most topics were at an early resear ch stage, Mike Sofia gave an update of sofosbuvir. A new clinical trial , testing a combination (GS5885, NS5A inhibitor) as a single pill and is now starting Phase III trials. Sofosbuvir was likely to be the first anti -HCV nucleotide analog to reach the marketplace. 27th ICAR, 2014 , Raleigh The h epatitis B virus mini-symposium included good updates on a range of topics but one stands out having current interest. Over the previous few years, there had been much progress towards understanding the critical role of the HBV core protein - it is much more than just a p rotective coat for the genome because it plays a major role in the HBV life cycle. The core protein, being 183 amino acids long, is known as Cp183. The first 149 amino acids are involved in core assembly whereas the last 34 residues, rich in serines and ar ginines, bind to RNA. Phosphorylation of the serines, particularly S155, S162 and S172, is required for specific packaging of full length HBV RNA complexed to the polymerase (reverse transcriptase - pregenomic RNA; RT -pgRNA). This RT -pgRNA complex initiate s encapsidation. There was a special session on local activity in Research Triangle Park . One report was on t he novel nucleoside analog BCX4430 which exhibits broad -spectrum antiviral activity and confers post -exposure protection against Ebola and Marburg viruses. Even in the current Ebola epidemic in West Africa, care workers were becoming infected and dying. Drugs, which are being investigated for treating these diseases, are progressed under the FDA ''Animal Rule''. In cell culture assays, BCX4430 is act ive against Ebola and Marburg viruses, (EC 50 ca 1 \u00b5M). Although a report on Truvada [a combination pill containing TDF and emtricitabine (FTC)] was included in this session, please see the following session. Challenges in HIV . A cure for HIV infections seemed to be a distant prospect. In contrast, preventing transmission of HIV is a proven possibility. Truvada was taken once daily to prevent HIV transmission, known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Although the adherence rates were unexpectedly poor, that minority of patients, who took essentially all their pills, were well protected. Whereas daily dosing seems to be acceptable for patients living with HIV, another option for PrEP is desirable. 40 The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade Since 2005, rhesus macaque models have been used in a long series of investigations. GSK -1265744 (generally known as GSK -744) is an HIV integrase inhibitor. It can be formulated with nano -particles to provide an injectable drug depot. In the macaque model, GSK -744, injected once monthly, gave full protection against repeated rectal and vaginal exposures. Because metabolism of GSK -744 is much slower in humans than macaques, it was expected to remain effective in humans for up to three months. A Phase I study confirmed that drug levels remai ned above the predicted effective level with a 20 -week dosing interval. A Phase II trial is planned. Another approach is to use vaginal rings, which have been in clinical use as contraceptive devices for years. In the macaque model, TDF -containing rings, r eplaced every 4 weeks, gave full protection. A Phase III trial has just been initiated. Another option, elvitegravir (EVG) and TAF , are being evaluated in a biodegradable polymer. 28th ICAR, 2015 , Rome The session on RNA viruses included a wide range of viruses: norovirus, rabies, dengue, hepatitis E, Hepatitis C and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Antiviral chemistry mini-symposium updated work by Chris Meier (University of Hamburg, Germany). At previous ICARs, he had reported on his cycloSal approach to deliver the nucleoside monophosphate (NMP) into a cell. Although there are many compounds which have poor antiviral activity due to inefficient phosphorylation to the monophosphate (MP), the limiting step may be at the phosphorylation to the di - or tri -phosphate (DP, TP). The focus of this presentation was the development of a strategy to synthesize prodrugs of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). Chris was able to demonstrate that such masked NTPs can enter cells and regenerate the TP inside cells, althoug h further optimization would be desirable. This work opened the door to a new area of research, investigating nucleotide triphosphates which are inactive in cell culture assays but which are highly active as inhibitors of viral polymerases. Emerging virus es session included chikungunya, viruses in the Balkans, Crimean -Congo hemorrhagic fever virus tick -borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), West Nile virus (WNV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 29th ICAR, 2016 , La Jolla The structural biology symposium included three topics, on HIV, coronaviruses and Ebola, all describing early -stage research. The symposium on diagnostic kits was a new venture for ICAR, a good innovation. It was introduced by Mark Prichard . For many years, there seemed to be little progress - as there were no antiviral compounds to treat specifi c viruses, there was no market for diagnostic assays - no assays, no way to develop a specific antiviral. Recently, technological developments in assay s have broken this negative cycle. Having used one of the platforms in his diagnostic laboratory for 16 months, Mark commented that he had no idea that there were so many cases of adenovirus infections in the pediatric population in the hospital. He recruited 6 firms to describe the ir assay platforms All the presenters gave an account of their diagnostic assays, not just the machinery but also the science and techniques used within the diagnostic platform. Most manufacturers have devised instruments which are small in size, moderatel y to easily portable, easy to set up and simple to operate. Sample preparation varies between simple and none required. Most steps are automated and the results, often in just over 1 h, are presented in an easily - understood format. Several firms offered pa nels which included both viral and non -viral agents , selected because these cause a particular set of clinical symptoms. The aim is to make it easy for the physician to choose the correct test first time and avoid having several tests in sequence. Many of the assays and panels are approved by the USA The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade 41 FDA (F ood and Drug Administration). With such rapid progress being made, it seems that physicians are close to having bedside answers within an hour. The DNA viruses symposium started with a review of human adenovirus (HAdV), its 7 species and many serotypes. Ad enovirus infections become a major clinical problem in transplant patients. There are no highly effective antivirals , but brincidofovir (BCV, CMX001), appears to have a better safety profile than its parent compound, cidofovir, although data in immunocompr omised patients are limited. Papilloma viruses encode HPV16 oncogenes (E6 and E7) which have been studied in HPV16 -transgenic mice. It is also possible to study the effect of host factors, in particular, the potential of estrogen to act as a co -factor. Without an inserted estrogen pellet, no cancer was detected. It was discovered that estrogen contributed to the progression of cervical cancer. Furthermore, if the estrogen pellet is removed, the cancer regresses. Although the role of estrogen in human cervic al cancer remains to be demonstrated, the known risk factors (HPV + oral contraceptives, HPV + many pregnancies, HPV + hormone replacement therapy (HRT)) all point towards estrogen being a factor. CMV is one of the largest and most complex of human viruses . In this report, samples (48) from 18 patients were obtained from various sites (including urine, plasma, saliva) and deep sequenced. From 4.1 x 1010 CMV bases sequenced, 859,441 single polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, of these, 153,975 were polymorphic sites. This diversity is markedly more than for other herpes viruses, (Epstein -Barr virus (EBV), HHV -6A or HHV - 6B) and also the RNA virus, West Nile Virus (WNV). The prevalence of pre -existing drug resistance alleles were around 1% for a panel of drugs, including those currently approved and three in development. In the viral DNA polymerase gene (UL 54), there were resistance alleles for GCV, foscarnet (FOS) and CDV. It is similar for the genes encoding the viral kinase (pUL97) which phosphoryl ates (activates) GCV (MBV), viral terminase (pUL56) which is inhibited by letermovir (AIC246), and for the target epitope (pUL 75) monoclonal antibody, MSL -109. 30th ICAR, 2017 reports on GS -5734 and Lassa fever, During the recent Ebola outbreak, in collaborated with researchers at Gilead Sciences , the novel antiviral compound GS -5734 was shown to have activity against Ebola virus . GS-5734 was also tested against lethal Nipah virus infection in nonhuman primates Another group reported that GS-5734 was active against circulating human CoV in various assays ( in vitro and in vivo ). Therefore, it has the potential to be effective against MERS -CoV in the Middl e East and , hopefully, emerging CoV of the future. Lassa virus , which causes Lassa fever, is endemic in a region across West Africa . A VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus) -based Lassa vaccine , similar to that for Ebola , was effective in challenge models agains t clade 4 and 5 viruses but a lack of models for clade s 1, 2, and 3 has slowed further laboratory investigations. Nevertheless, the VSV -Lassa vaccine is considered a frontline candidate . Although ribavirin is considered to be the standard therapy for Lassa fever, treatment of guinea pigs and non-human primates with favipiravir demonstrates superior protection from lethal disease . Furthermore, in the guinea pig model , favipiravir reverses signs of advanced di sease even when treatment is initiated at 9 days post -infection, typically within 36 -48 hours. As favipiravir is already licensed for treating influenza infections in some countries, these results support further trials in treating Lassa fever in humans. 42 The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade Posters: Spectrum of topics illustrated by award winners (Table 5.3) Over the years, there has been an enormous spectrum of topics presented by scientists of all ages and backgrounds. In particular, ISAR has encouraged younger researchers (students, Ph. D. and young investigators) by offering prizes for the best posters and their presentation. Each year, a hard -working team of senior ISAR members have had the difficult task of judging the posters, many of which have been of similar high standard. It has b een so difficult to judge the relative merits of posters prepared by scientists from different disciplines. In some years, this problem was resolved by having joint winners. To further illustrate the range of topics presented at ICAR , particularly from the younger generation , Table 5.3 includes the First Prize winners together with the topics presented. The poster titles are not included as many were very long. Table 5.3.

What has ICAR meant to me? My first contact with ICAR was indirect - I was a joint author of a poster presented by a colleague at the 2nd ICAR in Williamsburg ( April 1988 ). In June that year, I presented a poster at Antivirals 88 in Helsinki, Finland, this being my first antiviral conference. I was made to feel so welcomed into the antiviral world by an elderly gentleman, Bill Prusoff. Of all the attendees, it was Bill whom I remember most clearly , creating a deep impression . I had the good fortune to meet Bill many times over the years. As always, he was a charming companion. The 3rd ICAR was in Brussels, Belgium in 1990, where I met Erik De Clercq who was to become a life - long friend. Over the years, I have been fortunate to have joined the \"25 ICARs club\". During those early years, Wellcome, with acyclovir and Beechams, with famciclovir, were rivals. But Trudy Elion set the \"ICAR culture\" that good science was the top pri ority. We Beecham scientists had read every word of the Elion papers and were much impressed by the group who had shown how acyclovir could have good efficacy but retain an excellent safety profile by being activated by a herpes viral thymidine kinase enzyme. Trudy's interest and kindness led to my long - term friendships with scientists from Wellcome and Roche. To this day, ICAR retains that friendly culture. At the 19th ICAR in San Juan (2006) , I was asked by Hugh Field (a past President) to join the Public ation committee and Jack Secrist (then President) accepted Hugh's suggestion that I take over the job of writing the meeting reports - I had a hard act to follow, Kirk Field having done so for several years. I am grateful to Hugh and Jack for starting me on this path, and for the five following ISAR Presidents for their support. Most of the main presenters have kindly sent me copies of their slides and I have incorporated their comments into my reports. 44 The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade Although this has taken a lot of my time, I feel that I have gained a much greater understanding of those presentations, greatly broadening my antiviral base. Also, I have become aware of various trends. For me, the clinical symposium was one of ICAR's highlights. Our early research work should lead, albeit indirectly, to new therapies which help our brothers and sisters around the world. As times changed, less firms were willing to send staff to ICAR to present the results of their clinical trials. The last clinical symposium (2013) was disappointing (see ab ove). Since that time, there have been some of the most exciting clinical trials ever. In December 2013 , the FDA approval of sofosbuvir signaled the end of I FN-containing therapies for HCV. Various combinations of drugs, usually containing sofosbuvir, have had cure rates either close to 100% or even 100% for some cohorts. S urely ICAR has both a responsibility to report th ese land-mark results and to celebrate th ese great achievements. Likewise, the prospects, for prevention of HIV transmission, look bright, TruvadaR has proved that the prevention of HIV transmission is possible but that once -a-day dosing was not acceptable ; the use of long -acting drugs (once a month to a few times/year) has the potential to vastly reduce the number of newly -infected HIV patients. I hope that the ISAR Program committee will reinstate the clinical symposium and restore the quality by choosing speakers to invite. There have been many excellent presentations at ICAR but there are a few that excited me so much that I remember them still - my \"Top Ten\". The inaugural Prusoff Award lecture (2001) was by Chris McGuigan who set a new standard of clarity, exciting delivery and great science. At his first ICAR as President (2007), he gave a similarly stimulating lecture (see tribute by A ndrea Brancale). My next entry is a combination of presentations on sofosbuvir, starting with Mike Sofia reporting the ELECTRON clinical trial with the first, to my knowledge, having 100% cure rates, Phillip Furman continuing the story with his Elion Award lecture (2015) and Mike Sofia in his Elion Award Lecture (2017). Piet Herdewijn, in the inaugural Hol \u00fd Award lecture , reported how he used evolutionary pressure to create a new organism incorporating a nucleoside analog, I think the first to do so. Erica Ollmann Saphire (Pruso ff Award lecture, 2015) showed how viruses remodel, repurpose and rearrange their few encoded proteins to perform many tasks; her skillful use of colors transformed her slides from pretty pictures to accurate scientific clarity. Doug las Richman (Elion Award lecture, 2016) described the long polymerase and CAB is an integrase inhibitor, these two drugs have co mplementary activities. An injection 2 or 4 times a year could give effective ART for patients with HIV infection or prevent transmission to uninfected subjects. The problems now associated with poor delivery of ART, and hence the potential for HIV resista nce, in PBMCs may be largely avoided. The prospect of interrupting HIV transmission holds out hope that the HIV epidemic may be gradually controlled. Another entry is the Prusoff Award lecture (2016) by Jerome Deval. He reported on the efficacy of ALS -8176 , the oral prodrug of the nucleoside analog, ALS -8112, in a human RSV - challenge study. The reduction in viral load and symptoms was especially notable when a loading dose was used. The viral load area und er the curve (AUC) were reduced by >85% and the symp toms essentially remained at base line. A clinical trial in young children is ongoing. Hopefully, ALS -8176 will be a game -changer for the therapy of RSV infections. So far, my \"Top Ten\" has 7 entries. I hope that future ICARs will complete my ten. Anthony Vere Hodge The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade 45 6. Outlook for the 4th Decade - a personal view Key success factors for the first three decades. From its beginning, ISAR has maintained the following key aspects: 1. Broad spectrum in many dimensions (viruses, research, discipline, employment). 2. At ICAR, to present science of the highest quality. 3. To provide a warm welcome to all ICAR participants and to provide opportunities for networking, especially giving encouragement to new attendees. 4. To fulfil the aim of educating antiviral researchers worl dwide by publishing ISAR News and ICAR meeting reports. 5. Financial stability. Even during the first decade, ISAR became aware of competition within the antiviral community. During the second and third decades, there was increasing competition from other antiviral conferences, including some excellent meetings organized by other lear ned societies, but ISAR and ICAR have thrived and entered the fourth decade successfully. Certainly, all the above core ISAR attributes have been, and will be, vital for continuing success. But are these sufficient for the 4th decade? Especially during th e third decade, there have been various trends which need to be considered and managed. Communication technology has been transformed, leading to younger researchers using new outlets. Another factor is that our Society relies on a loyal group of individua ls willing to give their time. Presidents, Board members, Committee Chairs and all the committee members have volunteered their time and contributed to the success of each ICAR. Communication: adopting new technology. During the past decade, communicatio ns have been by e -mail to ISAR members, via the web site, by publication of the ISAR News and the ICAR meeting reports (on the web site and on free access in Antiviral Chemistry and Chemotherapy [AVCC], then in Antiviral Research [AVR]). Both the ISAR News and the meeting reports have the potential to reach many more people than are members of ISAR. For all the past decade, there has been a Facebook page within the web site and, a little later, a LinkedIn page was established but these have been little use d. Recently, with the strong support of the ISAR management, it is planned to make Social Media and webinars an important part of our communication strategy. This will surely help ISAR to reach the next generation. Although ISAR should use these new oppor tunities, the established communications may well reach different cohorts of antiviral researchers. The readership, of ISAR News and ICAR meeting reports, has been greatly increased by publication in established journals, initially Antiviral Chemistry and Chemotherapy (AVCC) and latterly in Antiviral Research (AVR). Only one meeting report (27th ICAR at Raleigh, 2014) was published in AVR under a commons license (free access) and this was associated with a much higher number of viewings/downloads than any o f the other reports: Following 5000 views/downloads by the end of 2017, there were another 220 during 2018, about 2/3rds of ICAR's attendance. As expected, most viewers were from North America followed by Europe but 275 viewers came from China. 46 The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade The Ambassa dor program, initiated by Bob Buckheit, has the potential to reach out to new members in countries currently poorly represented. I welcome the current leadership's support of this program as personal contact may be one of the most effective ways to recruit new members. Financial stability. We owe a huge debt to all our sponsors who have provided so much support each year. This funding has enabled the Society to organize its activities and provide assistance to young investigators, postdocs and graduate students. We gratefully thank all our corporate sponsors for their support during the third decade of ISAR. The Society has recognized the vital need to optimize it resources. The health of the Society and the success of our conferences will strongly depend o n how well we manage our assets and resources. For the past decade, Roger Ptak, more than any other, has sought funding from potential sponsors. He has done this work so quietly and efficiently that it is hard to remember a time when ISAR was facing financ ial difficulties. We all owe Roger a great vote of thanks. Long -term friendships. Birgit Zonsics, one of the students in the ANTIVIRALS European Training Network (ISAR News, 28.S1, 2018), noted: Many young researchers find the term networking a little int imidating. But the ANTIVIRALS network is very different. It started as collaboration between long -standing research collaborators and friends in the field of antiviral research. Hugh J Field (section 1, above) noted: One of the features of antiviral rese arch in the herpes field at this time was the friendly but strongly competitive rivalry between the researchers from the then Burroughs Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham companies promoting valaciclovir and famciclovir, respectively, for the treatment and pr initiated by Trudy Elion (Burroughs Wellcome and Nobel Prize recipient) who set the ISAR standard that, while respecting o ur company's loyalties, good science bound us together in friendships. Maaike Everts, (William Prusoff Young Investigator Awardee, 30th ICAR, Atlanta) noted that a key success factor for the collaboration was \"The 'glue' which holds the whole project together, Rich Whitley.\" Throughout the 3 decades, many long -term friendships have been initiated and rene wed at ICARs. I agree with Birgit, Hugh, Trudy and Maaike, that long -term friendships will remain vital to the continued success of ISAR/ICAR. Key success factors for the 4th decade Success through the next decade will depend on optimizing communications, financial stability and long - term friendships, these being key factors which should to be added to ISAR's core attributes of the first three decades. Of these, friendships may prove to be the most critical parameter, being the \"glue\" which will hold ISAR together and ensure the success of future ICARs. For myself, I have been fortunate to attend ICAR over 25 times. There are many reasons for my attendance but the most important has been to meet long -term friends. Anthony Vere Hodge The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade 47 7. In Memoriam William (Bill) H Prusoff , the \"Father of Antivirals\" Fig. 7.1 William (Bill) Prusoff (Courtesy of Raymond Schinazi.) Bill (Fig. 7.1) was born in Brooklyn, New York on 25th June 1920 and died on 3rd April 2011, aged 90. Bill and his wife, Brigitta, had two children and three grandchildren. During his school days, the family moved to Miami, Florida. Bill obtained a degree in chemistry from the University of Miami and a doctorate from Columbia University. He used to delight in telling his story that he ha d applied to Yale Medical School but was rejected with his application fee returned as his application was so poor. Yet he was to become a faculty member of Yale for 57 years and was awarded two of Yale's highest honors , the Peter Parker Medal and the Lifetime Achievement Award. At Yale in 1959, Bill synthesized idoxuridine which was to become the first FDA approved antiviral drug, used to treat herpes keratitis. Hence he became known as the 'father of antiviral chemothe rapy'. Later, he developed d4T (stavudine) for HIV/AIDS and he was largely responsible for ensuring that it was made available to those in need, such as in Africa. Bill established the W. H. Prusoff Foundation at Yale which has supported numerous programs . As one of the original ISAR members, Bill has been closely associated with the Society from its earliest days. Bill was the first recipient of the Society's Award of Excellence in 1988. He was a regular attendee of ICAR, his last active role being at Sav annah, Georgia in 2003 when he presented ISAR's William Prusoff Young Investigator Award to Johan Neyts. The following year, he declared 'I would like to be at the meeting because my spirit is in its 20s, but my body is in the thousands'. Maybe, but, in 20 05, we were delighted to see Bill again at ICAR in Barcelona. Adapted from ISAR News 21.1 (2011) Antiviral Chemistry & Chemotherapy 22.2 87-94 Earl Kern 48 The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd : Organic Chemist Whose Inventions Reshaped the Antiviral Drug World Fig. 7.2. Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd (1936 -2012) After a long, incapacitating illness due to the complications of Parkinson's disease, Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd (Fig. 7.2) passed away on July 16, 2012, at his home in Prague. He was born on September 1, 1936 in Prague (at the time, Czechoslovakia) where he would also graduate in 1959 as an organic chemist, and spend his whole life at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry (IOCB), from 1994 to 2002, as its Director. Dr. Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd was honored several times with prestigious awards in hi s home country, the Czech Republic, and obtained honorary degrees from the Universities of Olomouc (Czech Republic), esk\u00e9 Bud\u00e9jovice (Czech Republic), Ghent (Belgium), and Manchester (United Kingdom). The pioneering work of Dr. Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd was concentrat ed on the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, which conquered a key position in the treatment of AIDS, hepatitis B, herpes, and poxvirus infections. The basic discovery of this class of compounds was published 26 years ago in Nature (1986;323:464 -467) and wou ld be the subject of another Nature paper in 2006 (2006;439:745 -748). Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd laid the basis HepseraR, Viread\u00aeTM, TruvadaR, AtriplaR, Complera\u00aeTM and Stribild\u00aeTM mainly for the treatment of AIDS and hepatitis B. Truvada was the first anti -HIV drug ever to be approved for the prophylaxis of HIV infections, by the US FDA on July 16, 2012, exactly the same day that Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd died. Through his discoveries, Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd contributed to saving the lives o f millions of people worldwide by protecting them from such widespread diseases as AIDS and hepatitis B. With his discovery of the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (Nat Rev Drug Discov 2005;4:928 -940), Hol\u00fd added a new dimension to the therapy of AIDS, whic h, now that Truvada has been approved for the prophylaxis of HIV, may be heralded as a step forward in the eventual eradication of the disease. Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd was a reserved, humble scientist, soft spoken even before, due to his illness, his voice completely faded away. He was a gifted, highly productive chemist, who had only one passion in life \u2014change the world with medically useful drugs, whether antiviral or antitumoral. His molecules have changed the world of the antivirals. In the Czech Republic, Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd has entered the hall of fame, only preceded by other Czech heroes such as Gregor Mendel (the founder of genetics), Jaroslav Heyrovsk \u00fd (the discoverer of polarography), and Otto Wichterle (the pioneer of the soft lens). The Czech Republic should be pr oud of counting Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd as one of theirs, and so should be all of us who have known Dr. Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd as a Chemist, a Scientist and a Friend. With Dr. Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd , not only the Czech Republic, but the whole world has lost a true captain of research, a great inventor and innovator, and a real statesman of Science. Adapted from Medicinal Research Reviews, 33, No. 1, 1 -2, 2013 Dr. Erik De Clercq (A life -long collaborator and friend of Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd ) The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade 49 Chris McGuigan: A tribute to a remarkable innovator. Fig. 7.3. Christopher (Chris) McGuigan, 1958 -2016. In 2001, ISAR awarded for the first time the William Prusoff Young Investigator Award and the lecture was given by Chris McGuigan (Fig. 7.3), a superb nucleoside chemist from Cardiff University. Chris was already an accomplished scientist by then: he started his career obtaining his B.Sc., Chemistry, Hons (Class 1), at the University of Birmingham (1979) and his Ph.D. on Anticancer Drug Design (1982). He moved to University of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (1982 -84) as a post -doctoral fellow, then to University of Exeter as Demonstrator (1984 -85), to University College London as Lecturer (1985 -90) to University of Southampton as Lecturer (1990 - 94). His career at the Welsh School of Pharmacy began as a Reader (1994 -95), and then Professor (1995 -2016). In this role, Chris was an inspirational leader, training >40 Ph.D.s and >50 postdocs, published >220 papers and patents. The Prusoff award presentation reflected Chris's brilliancy and the importa nce of his research, coupled with a flawless ability to present his work in an exciting, yet scientifically rigorous, manner. The main highlights of that presentation were two important scientific ideas that were destined to make a huge impact. The first o ne was the discovery, in collaboration with Erik De Clercq and Jan Balzarini, of a novel family of nucleoside analogues with highly potent activity against varicella zoster virus (VZV). That project lead to the identification of Cf1743 (FV - 100) (Fig. 7.4) which is currently in Phase III clinical trials in patients with shingles. The second, and possibly the most important, scientific innovation that Chris presented, was the design and development of the ProTide approach, an incredibly efficient phosphoramid ate prodrug technology to deliver nucleoside monophosphates into cells. Jan Balzarini (Fig 7.5) was also an important collaborator in this discovery and indeed, in 2001, together with four other collaborative European Teams, they received the European Comm ission's Ren\u00e9 Descartes Prize for European Scientific Collaboration. Chris developed the ProTide throughout his career and he applied it to a variety of projects. For example, compound, Cf2761 (INX -08189, often as INX -189), a ProTide developed in collabor ation with Inhibitex, was shown to have excellent activity against Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (EC 50 10 nM). The clinical milestones were quickly achieved, first into man - May 2010 and first efficacy in patients - March 2011. Unfortunately, the trials were st opped due to toxicity concerns. However, it did prove that the phosphoramidate prodrug approach was successful and it was adopted by others. Perhaps the most evident legacy of Chris' work is represented by sofosbuvir and tenofovir alafenamide (Fig. 7.6), the \"backbone\" compounds in Gilead's single tablet regimens (STR) for treating patients infected with HCV and HIV, respectively. In addition, the ProTide approach was also applied successfully by Chris, in collaboration with NUCANA, in the antica ncer field: NUC -1031 (Acelarin\u00ae ) (Fig. 7.7) is currently in phase III for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. 50 The International S ociety For Antiviral Research: T he Third Decade Fig. 7.4.

Even in this role, his incredibly positive personality emerged: motivated, enthusiastic and driven, always very critical in the positive and constructive sense of the word, always very collaborative. Chris was also an extraordinary mentor and friend. He died far too soon. We sti ll miss him dearly, but his scientific and personal legacy will stay with us for a very long time.
