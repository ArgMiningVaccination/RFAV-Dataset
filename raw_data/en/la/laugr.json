Testimonials \"To become healthy doesn't necessarily require surgery. There are so many ways to treat illness/disease and it's refreshing to have a physician focused on comprehensive treatment and analysis. I am 60 years old, and Dr. Perrine has helped me attain a high quality of health through non-invasive sensible protocols.\" -JM \"I wish I could give Dr. Perrine 10 stars. I have never had a primary care experience like what is offered at Purist Natural Medicine. I have always had bumps and bruises from being a competitive athlete. Despite being able to fight through the pain (knees/neck/back/shoulder), eventually I realized that it is better for my performance and enjoyment to get ahead and really try to correct some structural imbalances I had been fighting through. The relief that I was able to receive through the innovative injections and mechanical advice from Dr. Perrine was game-changing. We corrected my issues from the roots of the causes instead of just addressing things with quick fixes. I have received lasting results and am playing harder than I have in years!!! Another important piece of my puzzle was the realization that Dr. Perrine provides true primary care. Initially, I was just interested in pain management but I was educated on how the foundations of nutrition and cellular health needs to be in place in order to heal. It makes a whole lot of sense. I was able to run blood work and discover changes that I needed to make from a nutritional and dietary standpoint. I was delighted to speed my recovery process along with addressing some other issues I had been having (energy/brain fog/GI symptoms). Overall, I would say the experience at Purist is as good as it gets. Dr. Perrine is knowledgeable and most importantly, she cares. You will go in looking to address a symptom and come out with lasting results in all aspects of your health. I realize now how impact that overall health can be in all aspects of your life, and that there is no other option but to take control of that!\" -GN \"Excited and thankful to @purist_natural_medicine for the b12 shot that launched my energy levels on the bike. Definitely went next level with my power numbers. I would recommend it if you have a race where you need to be at your best.\" -JT \"Allergies be gone! Over the counter meds never worked for me and for years I have just dealt with the symptoms, until now! Dr. Perrine created an all natural protocol to target my seasonal allergies. She suggested I try the Nebulizer, which I can confidently say has helped tremendously! After one consistent week of use, my symptoms are no longer interrupting my day to day life. The Nebulizer is easy to use, convenient and takes only 5 minutes out of my morning routine. I highly suggest you reach out to Dr. Perrine if you're curious about your options and want to "}
