Requirements and Application Procedures ADMISSION TO LIMITED ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS (LEP) Certain colleges, schools, and departments within the university have taken steps to limit enrollment in order to maintain quality programs. These include the School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, Robert H. Smith School of Business, A. James Clark School of Engineering, Philip Merrill College of Journalism, Department of Biological Sciences, Department of Biochemistry, Chemistry and Environmental Sciences and Policy-Biodiversity and Conservation, Department of Communication, Department of Criminology, Department of Government and Politics, Department of Natural Resource Sciences and Landscape Architecture and Department of Psychology. LEP programs are continually reviewed. Students should check the LEP website at www.lep.umd.edu or contact the Coordinator of Limited Enrollment Programs at 301-314-8385 for updated information. Freshmen: Admission for new freshmen to Limited Enrollment Programs is competitive. Because space may be limited for a particular major, early application is encouraged. Freshmen who are directly admitted to an LEP will be subject to a performance review when they complete 45 college credits. The review varies from program to program, but always includes satisfactory performance in a set of appropriate courses. Students not passing the review will be required to choose another major. See the academic program description for specific details. Freshmen not directly admitted to an LEP may be assigned to Letters and Sciences. Students are not guaranteed admission to an LEP at a later date, although they may gain admission by meeting the requirements outlined in their particular program by the time they complete 45 or 60 credits at Maryland. See the following section on LEP transfer admission and the LEP program descriptions for further details about this option. Transfers: Transfer students and on-campus students wishing to change their major to an LEP must meet a set of gateway courses with minimum grades in order to be admitted to the program. Space is limited in each program, and the most qualified applicants will be admitted each semester. Additional information for each of the Limited Enrollment Programs may be found in the descriptions of academic majors in chapter 7. Transfer students who are not directly admissible to an LEP upon application to the university will be assigned to an alternate program. Those with fewer than 60 credits will be assigned to Letters and Sciences, and will be allowed the opportunity to meet the gateway requirements by the time they complete 45 or 60 credits. Students with more than 60 credits will be admitted to an interim advising program in Letters and Sciences where they will be advised regarding their qualifications for the LEP and, in some cases, students need to choose another major. Second Major: Enrolled students interested in adding an LEP as a second major should see \"Degree Requirements\" in chapter 4. Pre-Professional Programs While professional schools do not require, favor, or prefer specific majors, pre-professional advisors can provide guidance concerning the choice of major. Undecided students may enter Letters and Sciences, but must adhere to the University of Maryland policy, that students declare a degree-granting major by the time they reach 60 credits. See www.ltsc.umd.edu . 1. Requirements and Application Procedures Page 6For further information on pre-professional programs, see \"Other for Credit Programs\" in Chapter 7, www.prelaw.umd.edu or www.prehealth.umd.edu . ADVANCED PLACEMENT (AP) CREDIT The University of Maryland encourages applicants to seek AP credit so that academically successful students may move forward in their programs at an appropriate pace. However, credit is not granted for all exams offered by the College Board. Credits are accepted and courses are exempted, based on departmental approval, according to the chart below. Students should arrange to have their scores sent directly to the University of Maryland from the Educational Testing Service; the code is 5814. Students should also inform their advisors at Orientation that they anticipate receiving AP credit because this information may affect their placement in subject-matter courses. If a student has already received AP credit at another institution, this credit will be reevaluated. The score received must be equivalent to the minimum score the University of Maryland accepted at the time the test was taken; otherwise, the credit will not be eligible for transfer. AP credits that are accepted are recorded as transfer credit on University of Maryland records and figure in the total number of credits earned toward graduation. Students may not receive AP credit for an equivalent course taken at the University of Maryland or elsewhere. If students earn credit in a course equivalent to an AP exam for which they also earned credit, the AP credit will be deleted from their records. Students should check with their advisors for detailed information on the assignment of AP credit. Please note that the chart represents a general outline of AP credit. In all cases, credit is available only for grades of 3 or higher, subject to ongoing departmental reevaluation. All departments reserve the right to reevaluate the content of exams and to change the assignment of credit and course equivalencies. Any new exams offered after February 15 may or may not be evaluated by the appropriate department. Students should check with their advisor at Orientation. Certain departments, particularly Mathematics and Physics, have separate criteria for placement in courses and the assignment of credit. Students should check with those departments for additional information. All entering freshmen will be placed in math courses according to the University of Maryland math placement exam.

The university's Mission Statement expresses a commitment to achieving excellence as the state's primary center for research and graduate education and the institution of choice for undergraduate students of exceptional ability and promise. Consistent with 1. Requirements and Application Procedures Page 7this m ission , the university counts the diversity of its students among its greatest strengths and as an integral component of the educational process and a contributing factor to the academic excellence of the institution. The undergraduate admission process, which reflects the university's educational m ission , seeks to identify those applicants, who as individuals and as a group, will enrich and benefit from the campus learning environment, and thus benefit the entire student body. The process is structured to build entering classes of students whose varied backgrounds and experiences provide substantial evidence of their potential to: 1. Meet the university's requirements for academic success. 2. Enrich the university as a heterogeneous community. 3. Add new perspectives to the university's curriculum and scholarly pursuits. 4. Develop personal skills, including leadership, self-confidence, and intellectual engagement. 5. Contribute to the intellectual, cultural, social and political life of the university, state, and nation. As the university must make fine distinctions among large numbers of highly qualified applicants, the ability to assess consistently all information presented in the application becomes increasingly important. Therefore, the university employs a rigorous review process that engages the expertise of professional educators in performing individualized and holistic evaluations of each application. Each applicant is assessed on the basis of achievements and potential in a broad range of academic categories, viewed in the context of the opportunities and challenges the applicant has faced. These categories include: 1. Strength of educational performance, as measured by the nature and rigor of high school curriculum and academic achievements. 2. Potential for college success, as evidenced by performance on nationally normed standardized tests. 3. Potential to promote beneficial educational outcomes and to make a positive contribution to campus and community life. 4. Persistence, and commitment to educational excellence, as evidenced by demonstrated success in facing adversity and overcoming obstacles.

RESIDENCY INFORMATION 301-314-7915 E-mail: resclass@umd.edu http://registrar.umd.edu/resreclass.html Petitions, related documents and questions concerning the Board of Regents Policy on Student Classification for Admission and Tuition Purposes should be directed to the Residency Reclassification Services in the Office of the Registrar. Determination of In-State Status for Admission and Tuition Purposes: See www.usmh.usmd.edu/regents/bylaws/SectionVIII/VIII270.html for the complete text of this policy. An initial determination of in-state status will be made by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at the time a students' application for admission is considered. The determination made at that time, and any determination made thereafter, shall prevail in each semester until the determination is 1. Requirements and Application Procedures Page 15successfully challenged. Students may challenge their classification by submitting a timely petition to the Residency Reclassification Services. Determinations are based on the residency policy and requirements. The deadline for submitting a complete petition along with all supporting documents, is the first day of the semester in which the student wishes to be classified as in-state. The volume of requests for reclassification may necessitate a delay in completing the review process. A decision in each case will be made within 60 days of receipt of a complete petition and all required documentation. During this period of time, or any further period of time required by the university, any fees and charges based on the previous determination must be paid. The student is solely responsible for any late charges incurred by the residency process. If the determination is changed, any excess fees and charges will be refunded. Students classified as in-state for admission and tuition purposes are responsible for notifying the Residency Reclassification Services in writing within 15 days of any change in their circumstances that might in any way affect their classification at the University of Maryland. SPECIAL APPLICANTS Golden Identification Card Program The University of Maryland participates in the Golden Identification Card Program. The institution will make available courses and various services to persons who are 60 years of age or older, who are legal residents of the State of Maryland and who are retired (not engaged in gainful employment for more than 20 hours per week). When persons eligible for this program are admitted to the university, they register on a space-available basis for credit courses as regular or special students in any session and receive a Golden Identification card. Golden ID students must meet all course prerequisite and co-requisite requirements. Tuition is waived for these courses; however, a Golden ID administrative fee is assessed every semester. Golden ID students may register for a maximum of three courses per term. Golden ID students are not eligible for Consortium courses. The Golden Identification Card will entitle eligible persons to certain academic services, including the use of the libraries and the shuttle bus service. Such services will be available during any session only to persons who have registered for one or more courses for that semester. Golden ID students also have the opportunity to become involved with the Golden ID Student Association, which provides cultural and social events, course recommendations, and peer advising. Additional information may be obtained from the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at 301-314-8385. Non-Degree Seeking Students Applicants who qualify for admission but do not desire to work toward a baccalaureate degree may be admitted as non-degree seeking students. Non-degree seeking students who have received a baccalaureate degree are advised that no credit earned while enrolled may be applied at a later date to a graduate program. These post-baccalaureate students may enroll in undergraduate courses for which they possess the necessary prerequisites, but may not enroll in courses restricted to graduate students only. Students who wish to take courses at the graduate level (600 and above) must contact the Graduate School for information concerning admission requirements for Advanced Special Student status. Non-degree seeking students who do not have a baccalaureate degree must submit transcripts and meet regular admission standards. Transcripts are not required from students with baccalaureate degrees from a regionally accredited institution. Because of space limitation, several departments require that permission be given in advance to register for classes as a non-degree student. Please 1. Requirements and Application Procedures Page 16contact the Office of Undergraduate Admissions for further information. Non-degree seeking students who are taking classes to transfer immediately back to another institution may apply without academic transcripts. These applicants must, in lieu of transcripts, submit official documentation from that institution granting permission to take course work at the University of Maryland for that particular semester. Returning Students and Veterans Applicants who have not attended school for more than five years, or who have had military experience, should contact both an admission counselor in the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at 301-314-8385 and the Returning Students Program at 301-314-7693. Veterans should also contact the University of Maryland Veterans Certification Office at 301-314-8239. Students returning to the University of Maryland after a separation of five calendar years may petition the appropriate dean to have a number of grades and credits from courses previously taken at the University of Maryland, College Park, removed from the calculation of their cumulative grade point averages and from the credits applied toward graduation requirements. See information under \"Registration, Academic Requirements and Regulations\" in chapter 4. TRANSFER ADMISSION Admission to the University of Maryland is competitive. Review the Statement of Philosophy of Undergraduate Admissions and Admission Review Factors for more information regarding our admission process. When the number of students desiring admission exceeds the number that can be accommodated at this institution, or in a particular professional or specialized program, admission will be based on the overall strength of the student's academic performance. In accordance with Maryland Higher Education Commission and Board of Regents transfer polices , certain applicants from Maryland public institutions are given special consideration and are admitted when space is available. The Admission Committee considers the student's academic record and grades received in all college-level courses. Students are expected to have completed English Composition (the equivalent of UM's ENGL 101) and college level mathematics (the equivalent of UM's Math 110 or above). Students who graduate from high school and subsequently complete a minimum of 12 semester hours or 18 quarter hours during a regular term excluding summer school, at a regionally accredited college or university are considered transfer applicants. Students who complete fewer than 30 semester or 45 quarter hours are expected to submit high school records and SAT I and/or ACT scores for review. When an applicant has attended more than one institution, a cumulative average for all previous college work attempted will be computed. To be considered, course work must have been completed at a regionally accredited college or university. Application Dates Semester Date Spring Priority Spring August 1 November 15 Fall Priority March 1 1. Requirements and Application Procedures Page 17Fall June 1 Transfer from Maryland Public Institutions Currently, applicants who have attended Maryland public institutions may be admitted in accordance with the criteria outlined in the previous paragraph. The university subscribes to the policies set forth in the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) and Board of Regents transfer policies. When the number of students desiring admission exceeds the number that can be accommodated in a particular professional or specialized program, admission will be based on criteria developed by the university to select the best qualified students. Articulated transfer programs are available at each Maryland community college. An articulated transfer program is a list of courses that best prepare applicants for a particular course of study at the University of Maryland. Applicants who take appropriate courses specified in the articulated program and earn acceptable grades are guaranteed transfer with no loss of credit. Articulated transfer programs help students plan their new programs after changing career objectives. More information about ARTSYS, the articulation system, is available online at artweb.usmd.edu . Applicants can eliminate all doubt concerning transfer of courses by following articulated programs. General Transfer Information Admitted students will receive a preliminary review of transfer credit within two weeks after receiving the letter of admission. An official review of transfer credit occurs thereafter, with final determination of applicability made by an academic advisor/evaluator in the office of the appropriate dean for the major. Generally, college-level courses completed at regionally-accredited institutions will transfer provided that grades of at least \"C-\" are earned and the course is similar in content and scope to work offered at Maryland. The regional accrediting bodies are Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, New England Association of Schools and Colleges, North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges, Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and Western Association of Schools and Colleges. Up to 60 credits from a community or two-year college, or 90 credits from a four-year college, may be applied toward the degree. Regardless of the total number of transfer credits, students must complete at least their last 30 credits at the University of Maryland, College Park. Normally these 30 credits will be the final 30 credits counted toward the degree. However, credits from University-approved study abroad and internship programs, and a maximum of six credits that are not part of such programs, may be included in the final 30 if approved in advance by the dean of the academic unit from which the student expects to receive the degree. Transfer of course work completed at Maryland public colleges and universities is covered by the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) transfer policies (see complete text later in this section). Maryland will accept grades of \"D-\" (as of Fall 2012) or better from appropriate course work completed at a regionally-accredited Maryland public institution. The Transfer Credit Center provides articulation information and assistance to students and transfer advisors. The Center, a joint effort between the Offices of Undergraduate Admissions and the Office of the Registrar, has computerized and consolidated the transfer credit evaluation process. It provides incoming students from domestic institutions with information on acceptability of credits and transfer equivalencies, subject to adjustment by advisors within the student's individual program. Certain courses (e.g., those not appearing or not fully elaborated in the sending institution's current catalog) may require additional information such as syllabi, portfolios, etc., before evaluation. Information on transferability of specific courses to the University of Maryland, College Park may be accessed on the web at www.tce.umd.edu/TCE . 1. Requirements and Application Procedures Page 18Each college-level course will be evaluated individually, with applicability toward major or general education requirements determined by the appropriate academic unit. The university does not transfer blocks of courses, such as those completed through the Associate's Degree. See \"Departments, Majors and Programs\" for specific general education and major requirements. Credit will be posted to your Maryland record only from official transcripts sent from the institution at which the credit was completed. Students who have earned credit through Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), or College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) subject area exams must have scores sent directly from the testing board, even if they are already posted on a transcript from another institution.

Applicability is determined by the appropriate dean. 2. Professional courses are generally not transferable. Course taken at a regionally-accredited institution may be reviewed by the appropriate dean. Statement on Transfer of Course Credit The University of Maryland welcomes transfer students and has transfer agreements (sometimes referred to as \"articulation\" agreements) to encourage and aid students in their efforts to take appropriate courses prior to transfer. Each course is evaluated individually for students seeking to transfer to the University of Maryland. Credit is granted for courses that are applicable to a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree, and for which a grade of \"C-\" or above was earned. Courses completed at Maryland public two- or four-year institutions may be transferred with grades of \"D-\" (as of Fall 2012) or above provided that course content is appropriate to our academic programs. Maximum Number of Transfer Credits Accepted The University of Maryland has direct transfer agreements with all Maryland community colleges, as well as other junior and community colleges outside of the state. The university will accept for transfer a maximum of 60 credits from a two-year program or 90 credits from a four-year program for courses in which a grade of \"C-\" (as of Fall 2012) or above was earned and which are appropriate to an approved curriculum at this institution. Maximum Number of Credits Allowed for Non-Traditional Learning Students who have acquired college-level learning through work or other non-collegiate activities may wish to translate their experience into credits at Maryland by validation through the national CLEP examination (College-Level Examination Program) or credit-by-examination administered by academic departments. The university will accept a maximum of 30 hours of credit through examination. Minimum Number of Credits Required Through Classroom Instruction in the Major Field and for the Degree The University of Maryland requires a minimum of 120 semester hours of credit for an undergraduate degree; some programs require more. Regardless of the total number of transfer credits, students must complete at least their last 30 credits at the University of Maryland, College Park. Normally these 30 credits will be the final 30 credits counted toward the degree. However, credits from University-approved study abroad and internship programs, and a maximum of six credits that are not part of such programs, may be included in the final 30 if approved in advance by the dean of the academic unit from which the student expects to receive the degree. Statement on Transfer of General Education Requirements As directed by the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) Transfer Policy, transferable courses taken in fulfillment of general education requirements at a Maryland public institution will be applied toward University of Maryland's general education requirements. Careful planning with an academic advisor will ensure that students take appropriate credit and maximize their credit transfer. The total number of general education credits for a Maryland public institution transfer or post baccalaureate credits will not exceed that required of native students.

Refund requests should be processed by students with the Office of the Bursar, otherwise any credit on the student account could be carried over to the next semester. If a Cancellation of Registration is submitted to the Office of the Registrar before the official first day of classes the student is entitled to full credit of semester tuition. Undergraduate students withdrawing from the university will be credited for tuition and fees in accordance with the following schedule: Prior to 1st day of classes 100% 1st 10 days of classes 80% 3rd week 60% 4th week 40% 5th week 20% After 5th week No refund Note: First-semester freshmen who receive Title IV aid and who withdraw will receive a refund in accordance with federal regulations.

However, if students later add a course or courses thereby changing the total number of credits for which they are registered to 12 or more, they will be billed for the difference between per-credit-hour fees paid and the general fees for full-time undergraduates. If during the first five days of classes full-time undergraduates drop a course or courses thereby changing the total number of credits for which they are registered to 11 or fewer, charges for the semester will be assessed on the basis of part-time charges plus 20% of the difference between the full-time fees and appropriate part-time charges. After the first five days of classes, there is no refund for changing from full-time to part-time status. Students who register as part-time undergraduate students and apply for a refund for courses dropped during the first week of classes will be given an 80% refund. No refund will be made for courses dropped thereafter. No part of the charges for room and board is refundable except when students officially withdraw from the university or when they are given permission by the appropriate officials of the university to move from the residence halls and/or to discontinue dining hall privileges. In these 2. Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid Page 27cases, the room refund will be computed by multiplying the number of periods remaining by the pro rata weekly rate after adjusting for a service charge. Refunds to students having full board contracts will be calculated in a similar manner. No room and/or board refunds will be made after the 14th week of the semester. Students are reminded that reservations for room and board must be canceled by the date published in the residence hall and dining services agreement(s). In computing refunds to students who have received the benefit of scholarships and loans from university funds, the computation will be made to return the maximum amount to the scholarship and loan accounts without loss to the university.

Interested students should contact their state scholarship agencies for information. Scholarship Searches: A broad range of scholarships are available from private sources. Usually, these awards are not as well publicized as state and university programs. Therefore, students should conduct a scholarship search to locate such sources. The University of Maryland offers access to several services to students to aid them in their searches. Access our website at www.financialaid.umd.edu/scholarships to use these services. 2. Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid Page 30NEED-BASED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE 0102 Lee Building 301-314-9000 301-405-9265 umfinaid@umd.edu www.financialaid.umd.edu Grants The Office of Student Financial Aid administers several grant programs for undergraduates. Awards are made based on financial need as determined by the FAFSA. Grants do not have to be repaid. Access our web site at www.financialaid.umd.edu for more information. Federal Pell Grant: This grant provides a \"foundation\" of financial aid, to which aid from other sources may be added. Only undergraduates who are seeking their first bachelor's degree and have exceptional need may receive a Federal Pell Grant. All undergraduates will be considered for this grant regardless of when their applications were received. Students may receive the Federal Pell Grant for less than full-time attendance, although the award will be pro-rated based on the number of credits attempted. Awards range from $605 to $5,645. Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Through the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, Congress created the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program that provides grants of up to $4,000 per year to students who intend to teach in a public or private elementary or secondary school that serves students from low-income families. To receive the TEACH Grant students must complete the FAFSA, be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen, enrolled as an undergraduate, post-baccalaureate or graduate student, enrolled in a coursework necessary to begin a career in teaching or plan to complete such coursework, maintain a cumulative 3.25 GPA and sign a TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve. Questions regarding the TEACH Grant Program can be directed to the Office of Student Financial Aid. Institutional Grants: The University of Maryland (UM) grant is awarded to full-time students who demonstrate financial need and meet OSFA's priority application deadline of February 15. The OSFA selects the recipients of this award based on availability of funds and the qualifications of the applicants. The UM grant may be awarded to undergraduates who demonstrated need and high academic achievement. The UM Grant may be awarded to any undergraduate with demonstrated need. Award amounts for these programs range from $500 to $4,700. Self-Help Financial aid also consists of self-help assistance such as employment and student loan programs. Most of these programs are awarded based on need as determined by the FAFSA. Access our web site at www.financialaid.umd.edu for additional information. Federal Work-Study: The Federal Work-Study (FWS) Program provides students with the opportunity to earn money to meet their educational and personal expenses. Money earned from the FWS program does not have to be paid back. To be considered for FWS, students must meet OSFA's priority application deadline of February 15. This award is need-based and may range from 2. Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid Page 31$800 to $2,000. Pay rates depend on the level of complexity of the work, but will be at least the federal minimum wage. Like all university employees, FWS employees receive a paycheck every other week for the hours worked. Most FWS jobs are on campus, though opportunities exist through the Community Service Program for FWS students to work off campus at several Federal Government Agencies. The number of hours students may work is limited to 20 per week while school is in session and 40 per week during vacations and summer break. Paid Internships: Students with paid internships sign a contract at the beginning of the semester that states the payment amount for the number of hours to be worked during that semester. The payment amount is advanced to the student's account at the start of each semester. This program differs from Federal Work-Study in that students receive all \"wages\" at the start of each semester, as opposed to a bi-weekly pay check, and those funds are applied directly to the student's account. Several offices and departments on campus, including Shuttle UM, Residential Facilities, and Dining Services, offer paid internships. Students should contact the department or office for which they are interested in working. Federal Perkins Loan: The Perkins loan is a low-interest rate (5%) loan for students with exceptional financial need. This is a loan borrowed from the school, and must be repaid. To be eligible, students must meet OSFA's priority application deadline of February 15. The amount of the award will depend upon the student's need and may range from $200 to $1,000. New borrowers (those who first receive a federal Perkins Loan after July 1, 1988) have a grace period of nine months after graduating or leaving school before they must begin repayment of their federal Perkins Loan(s). Interest will begin accruing at the time of repayment. This loan is interest-free while students are attending school and enrolled at least half time in a degree-seeking program. Direct Stafford Loan: This is a low-interest-rate loan for students who attend at least half-time. Application is made through the school's financial aid office via the FAFSA. Eligibility for this loan is based on need, not credit worthiness. This loan is borrowed by the student and must be repaid. There are two types of Direct Stafford Loans: subsidized and unsubsidized. The Direct Stafford subsidized loan is awarded to students with demonstrated financial need; this loan is interest-free while students are attending school and enrolled at least half-time in a degree-seeking program. Students who do not demonstrate financial need, or who do not demonstrate sufficient need to borrow a fully Direct Stafford subsidized loan, may borrow a Direct Stafford unsubsidized loan. The Direct Stafford unsubsidized loan is interest bearing. Students borrowing a Direct Stafford unsubsidized loan will be required to repay the principle and any interest that may accrue during school attendance. All students who want to apply for either Direct Stafford loan must complete the FAFSA. As of July 1, 2012, the Direct Stafford subsidized loan has a 3.4% fixed interest rate. The Direct Stafford unsubsidized loan has a 6.8% fixed interest rate. Students who graduate or drop below half-time status are granted a six-month grace period before repayment of the Direct Stafford loan is required. The following are the maximum loan amounts per academic year: $5,500 for undergraduates with freshman status, $6,500 for undergraduates attaining sophomore status, and $7,500 for undergraduate students who attain junior or senior status. If students do not demonstrate sufficient need to borrow the maximum Direct Stafford subsidized loan, they may borrow the difference in a Direct Stafford unsubsidized loan. The maximum borrowing limit for most undergraduates is $31,000. Direct PLUS (Parent Loans For Undergraduate Students) Loan: This is a non-need-based loan, which parents may borrow to help defray the cost of their dependent children's education. The Direct PLUS enables parents to borrow the full yearly cost of attendance (as determined by the school) 2. Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid Page 32minus all other financial aid. Otherwise, there is no yearly or cumulative borrowing limit. As of July 1, 2011, the student is required to complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) in order to apply for the Direct PLUS loan. After the FAFSA is completed, borrowers must submit the Direct PLUS loan application to the school for calculation and certification of the maximum loan amount that the parent may borrow per student per year. The Direct PLUS loan application is located on the OSFA web site at www.financialaid.umd.edu and select the link \"Printable Forms\". The Direct PLUS is granted to borrowers based on credit-worthiness as determined by the Department of Education whom the borrower selects. The Direct PLUS loan has a 7.9% fixed interest rate. The borrower has the option of beginning repayment on the Direct PLUS loan either 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed or not until six (6) months after the dependent student on whose behalf the parent borrowed ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis. OFFICE OF STUDENT FINANCIAL AID 0102 Lee Building 301-314-9000 301-405-9265 umfinaid@umd.edu www.financialaid.umd.edu The Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) administers all types of federal, state, and institutional financial assistance programs, and, in cooperation with other university offices, participates in the awarding of scholarships to deserving students. The primary responsibility for financing attendance at the University of Maryland, College Park, lies with students and families. Scholarships, grants, loans, and work-study positions are awarded on the basis of academic ability and/or financial need as determined by a federal needs analysis system. It is the intent of OSFA to provide assistance to students who might not otherwise be able to pursue college studies due to financial constraints. Financial aid funds are limited; therefore, all new, readmitted, and returning students must follow these steps to receive priority consideration for financial aid: Student admissions applications and all necessary supporting documents to the Office of Admissions by the appropriate deadlines (Deadlines are listed in Chapter 1)1. Complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) after January 1. The FAFSA is available on the OSFA web site at www.financialaid.umd.edu. A new FAFSA is required for each academic year of the student's enrollment.2. New students should not wait to be admitted before filing the FAFSA. A financial aid application has no bearing on a student's admission application. However, students will not receive final consideration for aid until they are admitted to a degree program. 3. Complete the FAFSA no later than February 1, so that it is received by the federal processor by February 15. Applying online helps to expedite the process. Income for the previous year may be estimated initially and corrected later on the Student Aid Report (SAR). Applications received before February 15 will be given priority consideration. General Regulations Applicable to All Forms of Aid 2. Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid Page 33Full-Time Status. For most types of aid, students must attempt at least 12 credit hours through the schedule adjustment period each semester in order to receive the full financial aid award. Please refer to the standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) when considering dropping below 12 credit hours for any given semester. Please visit the Office of Student Financial Aid to review the Satisfactory Academic Progress policy at www.financialaid.umd.edu . Citizenship Status. In order to be eligible for federal, state, or university financial assistance, students must be United States citizens or eligible non-citizens. Default/Owe Refund: Students cannot be in default on an educational loan, nor can they owe any refund on a Pell Grant or Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) previously awarded at any post-secondary institution. Degree-Seeking: Students must be working toward a degree or certificate. Students must be admitted to the university as \"degree-seeking.\" Satisfactory Progress: Students must be making satisfactory progress toward a degree or certificate according to the Standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) published in the Schedule of Classes. Please visit the Office of Student Financial Aid to review the Satisfactory Academic Progress policy at www.financialaid.umd.edu . Selective Service: To receive federal financial aid, male students must register with Selective Service if they are at least 18 years old and born after December 31, 1959, unless they are not required by law. The federal government will verify compliance of this registration requirement. Students who have questions about Selective Service registration may contact the Selective Service at 847-688-6888/1-888-655-1825 or www.sss.gov. Receiving a Non-University Award: If a student receives assistance (scholarship or loan) from a non-university source, the university may reduce the financial aid awarded by the university. It is the student's responsibility to notify the Office of Student Financial Aid of all outside awards. Change in Financial Situation: It is the student's responsibility to notify the Office of Student Financial Aid of any changes to his or her financial circumstances during the year. Reapplication Requirement: Need-based assistance is not automatically renewed from year to year. All students requesting need-based aid must reapply by submitting a new or renewal FAFSA annually. Such reapplication must indicate continued financial need and maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). Please visit the Office of Student Financial Aid to review the Satisfactory Academic Progress policy at www.financialaid.umd.edu . Award Policy: Financial aid is normally a combination of grants, loans, and student employment. The financial aid \"package\" is determined by the availability of financial aid and the financial circumstances of each student. It is not necessary to make any special application for university grants. The Office of Student Financial Aid will determine awards that best fit the needs and qualifications of the candidates. Estimating Educational Cost Costs of Attendance Budgets are estimates of the educational expenses incurred by students during the nine-month academic year. These budgets include direct university charges (tuition, fees and on campus room and board) and estimates of indirect expenses (transportation, books, supplies, miscellaneous living expenses, and off-campus room and board). Off campus cost of living expenses are determined based on the average room and board charges for 2. Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid Page 34Off campus cost of living expenses are determined based on the average room and board charges for the local area. These are indirect costs, not billed by the University. Actual College Park tuition and fees can be found by contacting the Office of the Bursar at www.umd.edu/bursar .

The university requires that all deposits and fees be paid by stated deadlines, or penalties must be imposed. Many potential administrative difficulties can be avoided if students carefully follow published procedures and notify the appropriate office(s) of any changes that might affect their financial obligation to the university. This includes updating your email address so communication concerning your billing is prompt, and notifying the Bursar's Office of changes of address so that mail affecting the student's financial relationship with the university will not be delayed or returned. Tuition and bill payment information for Summer Term, Winter Term, Freshmen Connection and Professional Programs may be found at www.oes.umd.edu . College Park sponsors a deferred-payment plan for the Fall and Spring semesters only. Information regarding the Terp payment plan is available by calling 301-314-9000 or 1-888-313-2404 or at bursar.umd.edu bursar.umd.edu . All charges incurred during a semester are payable immediately. Returning students will not be permitted to complete registration until all financial obligations to the university, including library fines, parking violations, and other penalty fees and service charges, are paid in full. Payment for past due balances and current semester fees is due on or before the first day of classes. Students who register in advance must pay their bills in full prior to the general registration period. Students who register after the initial registration period are required to make full payment by the 2. Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid Page 36due date indicated to avoid cancellation of their enrollment and loss of their classroom seats to other students. Although the university bills students monthly, it cannot assume responsibility for their receipt. Students are reminded that it is their responsibility to notify the University of any change in their email address. If a student bill is not received on or before the beginning of each semester, it is the student's responsibility to obtain a copy of the bill. To check your account balance or view your monthly billing statement go to bursar.umd.edu and choose \"View Your Monthly Bill\" or go to the Financial Service Center, 1135 Lee Building. The office is open Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. All checks or money orders should be made payable to the University of Maryland for the exact amount due. Student's name and student's University ID number should be written on the front side of the check . University grants and scholarships will be posted to the student's account. However, the first bill mailed prior to the beginning of each semester may not include these credits. Students are urged to check their residence hall and dining service agreements for procedures for cancellation of reservations and for deadlines for receiving refunds of deposits. Refunds cannot be made after these deadlines, even if the student decides not to attend the University of Maryland, College Park. Students will incur a late payment fee in the event of failure to pay a balance on their student account by its due date. A late payment fee of $10.00 or 5%, whichever is higher, will be assessed in addition to the total past due amount. An additional 1.5% finance charge will be charged monthly if the account is not settled. Students who fail to pay the indebtedness during the semester in which delinquency occurs will be ineligible to register for subsequent semesters until the debt and the penalty fees are cleared. In the event a student with a delinquent account becomes registered for a future semester, the account must be settled in full prior to the onset of the future semester, to avoid cancellation of registration. The state has established, under legislative mandate, a Central Collections Unit (CCU) within the Department of Budget and Fiscal Planning. The university is required by state law to refer all delinquent accounts to the State Collections Unit. Please note that Maryland law allows the Central Collections Unit to intercept state income tax refunds for individuals with delinquent accounts, and that CCU is authorized to notify a National Credit Bureau of the delinquency at the time the account is referred to it for collection. All accounts due from students, faculty, staff, non-students, etc., are included within these guidelines. Central Collections Unit costs incurred in collecting delinquent accounts will be charged to the student. The minimum collection fee is 17% plus attorney and/or court costs. No degrees, diplomas, certificates, or transcripts of records will be issued to students who have not made satisfactory settlement of their accounts. Note: Additional Information on Student Financial Obligations, Disclosure of Information, Delinquent Accounts, and Special Fees, can be found in the \"Policy Statements\" section at the beginning of this catalog. Payment of Fees All checks, money orders, or postal notes should be made payable to \"University of Maryland.\" The student's University ID number must be written on the front of the check.

These programs provide coursework in a wide range of disciplines so that participants can study abroad for a semester or academic year and still complete their degrees on schedule. A growing number of EA programs combine the concepts of global citizenship and entrepreneurship by engaging students in innovative projects designed to address health, economic, and environmental issues in the communities that host them during their overseas studies. EA collaborates with Maryland faculty and staff to administer almost 200 international programs in over 50 countries and to integrate overseas coursework into campus curricula. Professional advisors guide students in the selection of suitable programs and the arrangement of academic credit, assist with applications for financial aid, conduct pre-departure orientations, and provide on-call support to participants overseas. Recognizing that substantive international experience is a crucial part of any undergraduate education, EA continually seeks to enable every Maryland student to study abroad regardless of his or her major field of study or financial profile. Study Abroad Process Students interested in overseas studies should ideally visit the Office of Education Abroad one year before actually submitting an application in order to explore program options and learn more about the next steps in arranging academic credit, completing pre-requisites, and obtaining financial aid for their intended programs. When a student is prepared to begin an application, he or she should arrange to meet with an advisor by making an appointment through the on-line system at: http://international.umd.edu/studyabroad/196 . Types of Study Abroad Programs Maryland Exchange Programs : Exchange programs allow Maryland students to study for a semester or year at leading universities throughout the world while paying little more than their regular Maryland tuition, travel, and overseas living expenses. In exchange for each outgoing student, one from the overseas host university studies at the College Park campus for an equivalent period. While some exchange programs require foreign language proficiency, many are open to students who speak only English. These programs offer Maryland students an outstanding opportunity to develop lasting bonds with local students. Maryland Administered Programs : Students may receive Maryland resident credit for programs sponsored by academic departments and administered by Education Abroad. These include semester programs in Copenhagen, Haifa, Korea, London, Nice, Seville, Berlin, Barcelona, and Rome, as well as more than 70 short term courses taught by Maryland faculty during the summer, winter term, and 3. Campus Administration, Resources, and Student Services Page 42spring break in locations ranging from Morocco to Brazil. In addition to high-quality instruction, Maryland programs offer cultural activities, internships, and service opportunities to help students maximize their engagement with the host-country culture. Maryland Approved and Affiliated Programs: EA administers a wide range of programs in collaboration with vetted study abroad providers and universities, including The Council on International Educational Exchange (CIEE), the Institute for the International Education of Students, Macquarie University (Australia), The Education Abroad Network, ACTR Russia, and the University Studies Abroad Consortium (USAC). Non-Approved Programs : Maryland students who wish to study abroad through other organizations or institutions must petition to do so. The first step in this process is to speak with an EA advisor. Petitioners must demonstrate a compelling academic reason to participate in a non-approved program and that the program in question meets the same standards required of approved programs. EA strongly encourages students to explore its extensive list of affiliated and approved programs before beginning the petition process. More information and applications are available at the EA website: www.umd.edu/studyabroad .

Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Academic Advising Academic Advising Role of Advising Academic advising is an integral part of each student's educational experience and it takes many forms. Academic advisors provide students with information on academic requirements needed for degree completion, help students plan for future graduate study or a career, and serve as a research person. Academic advising is a shared responsibility between the student and the advisor. Provide information on academic requirements needed for graduation. Advisors assist students in developing an academic and career plan, monitor students in the major, and discuss how a course of study fits a particular academic or career interest. Advisors answer questions concerning a specific academic concern, such as problems with a particular class, and guide students through the registration process, including providing information on various registration blocks and what needs to be done to remove them. Help students plan for future graduate study or career. Advisors discuss how an academic major can prepare a student for his/her career, and what career options are available. Advisors refer students to the Career Center which provides career counseling and workshops on issues such as writing resumes and preparing for job interviews. They also inform students about internship opportunities and how credit can be earned, and provide information on study abroad programs that might enrich a student's academic experience as well as enhance their resume. Advisors inform students about graduate school opportunities and application procedures. Serve as a campus resource. Advisors assist students in obtaining support from other offices of the university. This includes informing students about possible scholarships or fellowships, and referring students to academic support units that provide tutoring or workshops on study skills, time management, and stress management. They may recommend that students seek counseling for stress, addictions, or trauma that may be affecting their academic work. Advisors inform students with physical and learning disabilities of the support available to them. They also encourage students to enrich their experiences by becoming involved on campus via social, political, academic, ethnic/cultural, sport and/or recreational student organizations and activities. Some advisors are able to provide information on all of the above. Others specialize in a particular topic or area of concern. For example, a college/department may have a specific career advisor or study abroad coordinator. Students in upper level courses are often advised by faculty members who can assist with graduate school and career issues. Furthermore, some advisors work with specific populations, such as returning students, athletes, students with physical or learning disabilities, and students of color. If you are not sure where to seek advising, contact your academic college. When requesting to meet with an advisor, specify what topics you wish to discuss to ensure that you are directed to the appropriate individual. Advising at the University of Maryland is normally a combination of professional advisors, located in many of the college office, and faculty advisors. Please check your individual college to find out whom you need to see for academic advising. For more information, visit www.advising.umd.edu . 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 80Academic Advising and Degree Completion All new students are required to attend Orientation where they will register for classes. During their first semester, students develop a four year plan based on templates provided for each major (see www.4yearplans.umd.edu ). Each plan includes specific benchmark courses to be completed within a specific period of time. Four year plans must be approved by an advisor in order to register for subsequent semesters. Students are required to complete the benchmark courses in their major in order to progress to graduation (see Student Academic Success-Degree Completion Policy below). Outlined in each four year plan, benchmark courses guide students in a step by step process to degree completion and demonstrate satisfactory progress in the major. Academic units conduct regular reviews of students' progress, and those students who are in danger of falling behind benchmarks will be required to work with an advisor to develop a plan to get back on track. Students who do not make progress may be required to select a new major in which they can be successful. Many students change their majors over the course of their academic career. When doing so, students must first complete and have approved a new four year plan. Any student who completes ten semesters or 130 credits without completing a degree is subject to mandatory advising prior to registration for any subsequent semester. Students with exceptional circumstances or those who are enrolled in special programs are required to develop a modified graduation plan that is appropriate to their situations. In all cases, students are responsible for meeting progress expectations and benchmarks required for their degree programs. It is recommended that all students seek advising assistance prior to course registration. Students should also consult with an advisor as circumstances change and four year plans need to be updated. Many colleges have mandatory advising for prior to registering for a new semester. Students placed on probation are required to consult an academic advisor in their college prior to the beginning of a new semester but no later than the end of the schedule adjustment period. Students will not be allowed to add or drop courses, or to register during any probation semester without the approval of an academic advisor in their college. Student Academic Success-Degree Completion Policy The goal of the Student Academic Success-Degree Completion Policy is to promote undergraduate student success. The policy establishes a structured framework and criteria to guide all students to completion of an undergraduate degree within a reasonable period of time. Full-time degree seeking students normally are expected to complete the undergraduate program in four years. Within this timeframe, all students are expected to demonstrate continuing progress in their majors by completing prerequisite or required courses with the appropriate grades, and by completing other requirements consistent with graduation progress or benchmarks established by their academic units (see 2, below). It is ultimately the responsibility of the student to meet these requirements. To help students meet these requirements the university will facilitate student progress to degree by providing enhanced student advising through the following measures: 1. Academic units will create 4-year graduation templates that will specify the degree requirements for each major and provide semester-by-semester course schedule models that achieve graduation within four years. Students will prepare individualized plans for completing their degrees in accordance with the academic units' 4-year graduation plans. Students are also encouraged to periodically update their plans with the assistance of their academic advisors. 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 812. Academic units will establish graduation progress benchmarks for each academic major. These will specify the credit and course criteria that will indicate satisfactory progress to degree. Academic units will establish schedules for regular periodic reviews of student progress, and students who are in danger of falling behind the program benchmarks will be required to consult with an advisor prior to registration. 3. Students who do not achieve the progress expectations or benchmarks will be permitted to continue in the major only upon the approval of the dean of their college. If it becomes necessary for students to change majors, they will be given assistance in identifying and enrolling in a suitable alternative major. 4. When students change majors, they will be required to present an academic plan to the new major unit that demonstrates their ability to complete their degree in a timely manner. While some students will have valid reasons to take additional time to degree, any student who completes 10 semesters or 130 credits (see footnote 1 for credits not counted towards these limits) without completing a degree will require mandatory advising in his/her college prior to registration for subsequent semesters. Students with exceptional circumstances, students whose programs include minors, double majors/degrees, enrichment activities or who need to pursue a degree part time will have on record approved plans with approved program benchmarks. Program benchmarks will be developed by the student in consultation with and approved by an advisor. Footnote 1 : Degree credits include University of Maryland credits and all applicable transfer credits from other postsecondary institutions. The equivalent semesters applicable to the enrollment limit for transfer credits will be determined by dividing all transfer credits applicable to the degree by 15. However, Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) credits, and credits earned for college courses taken while in high school and prior to matriculation at a postsecondary institution, will not count toward this semester or credit limitation. Such courses may, however, count toward degrees. Summer Session and Winter term will not be included in the semester count. Credits earned during Summer Sessions or Winter terms will be included in the credit count. Academic Integrity The University of Maryland is an academic community. Its fundamental purpose is the pursuit of knowledge. Like all other communities, the University can function properly only if its members adhere to clearly established goals and values. Essential to the fundamental purpose of the University is the commitment to the principles of truth and academic honesty. Accordingly, the Code of Academic Integrity is designed to ensure that the principle of academic honesty is upheld. While all members of the University share this responsibility, the Code of Academic Integrity is designed so that special responsibility for upholding the principle of academic honesty lies with the students. The University's Code of Academic Integrity is a nationally recognized honor code, administered by a Student Honor Council. Any of the following acts, when committed by a student, shall constitute 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 82academic dishonesty: Cheating: Intentionally using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic exercise. Fabrication: Intentional and unauthorized falsification or invention of any information or citation in an academic exercise. Facilitating academic dishonesty: Intentionally or knowingly helping or attempting to help another to violate any provision of the Code of Academic Integrity . Plagiarism: Intentionally or knowingly representing the words or ideas of another as one's own in any academic exercise. If it is determined that an act of academic dishonesty has occurred, a grade of XF is considered the normal sanction for undergraduate students. The grade of XF is noted on the academic transcript as failure due to academic dishonesty. Lesser or more severe sanctions may be imposed when there are circumstances to warrant such consideration. Suspension or expulsion from the University may be imposed even for a first offense. Students should consult the Code of Academic Integrity, at www.president.umd.edu/policies/iii100a.html for further information regarding procedures for reporting and resolving allegations of academic dishonesty. Honor Pledge In 2002, the University adopted an honor pledge in which students are asked to write out and sign the pledge on major assignments and exams, as designated by the instructor. The Honor Pledge is designed to encourage instructors and students to reflect upon the University's core institutional value of academic integrity. Professors who invite students to sign the Honor Pledge signify that there is an ethical component to teaching and learning. Students who write by hand and sign the Pledge affirm a sense of pride in the integrity of their work. The Pledge states: \"I pledge on my honor that I have not given or received any unauthorized assistance on this assignment/ examination.\" 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 83For more information regarding the Code of Academic Integrity, the Honor Pledge, or the Student Honor Council please refer to www.shc.umd.edu or contact the Office of Student Conduct at 301-314-8204. Student Conduct The primary purpose for the imposition of discipline in the university setting is to protect the campus community. Consistent with that purpose, reasonable efforts are also made to foster the personal and social development of those students who are held accountable for violations of university regulations. Compared to disciplinary systems at many universities, University of Maryland students are given unusual authority and responsibility for management of the campus process. Membership on the student judiciary is an extraordinary educational experience, and opportunity to be of service to the community, and a personal honor. Cases that may result in suspension or expulsion are heard by conduct boards, comprised entirely of students. In such cases, students are accorded substantial procedural protections, including an opportunity for a hearing and an appeal. Less serious cases are resolved in disciplinary conferences conducted by University staff members. Acts of violence (including any sexual assault), intimidation, disruption, or rioting; substantial theft or vandalism; fraud or forgery; use or distribution of illegal drugs; and any Code of Student Conduct violation motivated by considerations of sex, race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation or religion are forms of misconduct that most frequently result in dismissal from the University. Students accused of violating University disciplinary regulations are encouraged to discuss the allegations with their parents or guardians, legal counsel, and with appropriate university staff members. Prohibited Conduct A complete list of conduct considered prohibited as well procedures for resolving allegations of misconduct may be found in the Code of Student Conduct at www.president.umd.edu/policies or through the Office of Student Conduct website at www.studentconduct.umd.edu The following is general notice of what constitutes prohibited conduct and is subject to disciplinary action: Use, possession or storage of any weapon Causing physical harm or apprehension of harm Initiating or causing to be initiated a false report, warning or threat of fire, explosion or other emergency A criminal offense committed off-campus Violating the terms of any disciplinary sanction Misusing or damaging fire safety equipment Distribution or possession for purposes of distribution of any illegal drug Furnishing false information to the University Making, possessing, or using any forged, altered, or falsified instrument of identification Interfering with the freedom of expression of others Theft of property or of services; possession of stolen property Destroying or damaging the property of others Engaging in disorderly or disruptive conduct Failure to comply with the directions of university officials Use or possession of any illegal drug or controlled substances Use or possession of fireworks on university premises Use or possession of any alcoholic beverage under the age of 21 or providing alcoholic beverages to a person known to be under the age of 21 4.

Academic Records and Regulations The Office of the Registrar, located on the first floor of the Mitchell Building is responsible for maintaining student records and issuing official transcripts. Marking System The following symbols are used on the student's permanent record for all courses in which the student is enrolled after the initial registration and schedule adjustment period: A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F, XF, I, P, S, W, and AUD. These marks remain as part of the student's 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 86B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F, XF, I, P, S, W, and AUD. These marks remain as part of the student's permanent record and may be changed only by the original instructor on certification, approved by the department chair and the dean, that an actual mistake was made in determining or recording the grade. A+, A, A- denotes excellent mastery of the subject and outstanding scholarship. In computations of cumulative or semester averages, a grade of A+ or A will be assigned a value of 4.0 quality points per credit hour. A grade of A- will be assigned 3.7 quality points per credit hour. B+, B, B- denotes good mastery of the subject and good scholarship. A grade of B+ is assigned a value of 3.3 quality points per hour. A grade of B is assigned a value of 3.0 quality points per credit hour. A grade of B- is assigned a value of 2.7 quality points per hour. C+, C, C- denotes acceptable mastery of the subject. A grade of C+ is assigned a value of 2.3 quality points per hour. A grade of C is assigned a value of 2.0 points per credit hour. A grade of C- is assigned a value of 1.7 quality points per credit hour. D+, D, D- denotes borderline understanding of the subject, marginal performance, and it does not represent satisfactory progress toward a degree. A grade of D+ is assigned 1.3 points per credit hour. A grade of D is assigned a value of 1.0 quality point per credit hour. A grade of D- is assigned 0.7 quality points per credit. F denotes failure to understand the subject and unsatisfactory performance. A grade of F is assigned a value of 0.0 quality points per credit hour. XF- denotes failure due to academic dishonesty. An XF is treated in the same way as F for the purposes of cumulative agerage. The mark of \"I\" is an exceptional mark that is an instructor option. It is only given to a student whose work has been qualitatively satisfactory, when, because of illness or other circumstances beyond the student's control, he or she has been unable to complete some small portion of the work of the course. In no case will the mark \"I\" be recorded for a student who has not complted the major portion of the work of the course. For further explanation see \"Incompletes\" below. The mark of P is a student option mark, equivalent to a grade of D- or better. This grade is not used in any computation of quality points or cumulative average totals at the end of the semester. The student must inform the Office of the Registrar of the selection of this option by the end of the schedule adjustment period. For a full explanation see \"Pass-Fail Policy\" below. S is a department option mark that may be used to denote satisfactory performance by a student in progressing thesis projects, orientation courses, practice teaching, and the like. In computation of cumulative averages a mark of S will not be included. W is used to indicate withdrawal from a course by end of the schedule adjustment period. For information and completeness, the grade of W is placed on the student's permanent record by the Office of the Registrar. The instructor will be notified that the student has withdrawn from the course. This grade is not used in any computation of quality points or cumulative average totals at the end of the semester. AUD denotes a student registering to audit a course or courses which have been designated as available under the audit option and in which space is available. The notation AUD will be 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 87placed on the transcript for each course audited. A notation to the effect that this symbol does not imply attendance or any other effort in the course will be included on the transcript in the explanation of the grading system. Additional Record Notations In addition to the above marks, there are provisions for other record or transcript notations that may be used based on university policy and individual circumstances. Duplicate course : Used to indicate two courses with the same course content. The second course is counted in the cumulative totals unless an exception is made by the dean. Excluded Credit (Excl Crd) -: Excluded credit is noted when academic clemency has been granted. Incompletes : The mark of \"I\" is an exceptional mark that is an instructor option. It is given only to a student whose work in a course has been qualitatively satisfactory, when, because of illness or other circumstances beyond the student's control, he or she has been unable to complete some small portion of the work of the course. In no case will the mark \"I\" be recorded for a student who has not completed the major portion of the work of the course. 1. This Incomplete Contract form must be submitted to the dean of the college offering the course within six weeks after the grade submission deadline (if a grade hasn't already been submitted). If any Incomplete Contract isn't completed within the six week period, the instructor will convert the \"I\" to the appropriate grade. 2. The student will remove the \"I\" by completing work assigned by the instructor; it is the student's responsibility to request arrangements for the completion of the work. The work must be completed by the time stipulated in the contract, usually by the end of the next semester, but in any event, no later than one year. If the remaining work for the course as defined by the contract is not completed on schedule, the instructor will convert the \"I\" to the grade indicated by the contract. 3. Exceptions to the stated deadline may be granted by the student's dean (in negotiation with the faculty member or the faculty member's dean) upon the written request of the student if circumstances warrant further delay. 4. If the instructor is unavailable, the department chair, upon request of the student will make appropriate arrangements for the student to complete the course requirements. 5. It is the responsibility of the instructor or department chair concerned to submit the grade promptly upon completion of the conditions of the Incomplete Contract. 6. The \"I\" cannot be removed through re-registration for the course or through credit by examination. An \"I\" mark is not used in the computation of quality points or cumulative grade point averages. Non-applicable (Non-Appl) : In all cases of transfer from one college to another at the University of Maryland, College Park, the dean of the receiving college, with the approval of the student, shall indicate which courses, if any, in the student's previous academic program are not applicable to his or her new program, and shall notify the Office of the Registrar of the adjustments that are to be made in determining the student's progress toward a degree. Deletions may occur both in credits attempted and correspondingly in credits earned. This evaluation shall be made upon the students initial entry into a new program, not thereafter. If a student transfers from one program to another, his or her record evaluation shall be made by the dean in the same way as if he or she were transferring colleges. If the student subsequently transfers to a third college, the dean of the third college shall make a similar initial adjustment; courses marked non-applicable by the second dean may become applicable in the third program. 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 88Pass-Fail Policy Pass-Fail Policy: The following Pass-Fail policy was approved by the Board of Regents for implementation beginning with the Spring 1989 semester: 1. To register for a course under the pass-fail option, an undergraduate must have completed 30 or more credit hours of college credit with a GPA of at least 2.0. At least 15 of these credit hours must have been completed at the University of Maryland , College Park with a University of Maryland GPA of at least 2.0. 2. Courses for which this option applies must be electives in the student's program. The courses may not be college, major, field of concentration, or general education program requirements. 3. Only one course per semester may be registered for under the pass-fail option. 4. No more than 12 semester hours of credit may be taken under the pass-fail option during a student's college career. 5. Students may not choose this option when re-registering for a course. 6. When registering under the pass-fail option, a course that is passed will count as hours in the student's record but will not be computed in the grade point average. A course that is failed will appear on the student's record and will be computed both in the overall average and the semester average. 7. Students registering for a course under the pass-fail option are required to complete all regular course requirements. Their work will be evaluated by the instructor by the normal procedure for letter grades. The instructor will submit the normal grade. The grades A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D or D- will automatically be converted by the Office of the Registrar to the grade P on the student's permanent record. The grade F will remain as given. The choice of grading option may be changed only during the schedule adjustment period for courses in which the student is currently registered. Incompletes The mark of 'I' is an exceptional mark that is an instructor option. It is given only to a student whose work in a course has been qualitatively satisfactory, when, because of illness or other circumstances beyond the student's control, he or she has been unable to complete some small portion of the work of the course. In no case will the mark 'I' be recorded for a student who has not completed the major portion of the work of the course. 1. This Incomplete Contract form must be submitted to the dean of the college offering the course within six weeks after the grade submission deadline (if a grade hasn't already been submitted). If any Incomplete Contract isn't completed within the six week period, the instructor will convert the 'I' to the appropriate grade. 2. The student will remove the 'I' by completing work assigned by the instructor; it is the student's responsibility to request arrangements for the completion of the work. The work must be completed by the time stipulated in the contract, usually by the end of the next semester, but in any event, no later than one year. If the remaining work for the course as defined by the contract is not completed on schedule, the instructor will convert the 'I' to the grade indicated by the contract. 3. Exceptions to the stated deadline may be granted by the student's dean (in negotiation with the faculty member or the faculty members dean) upon the written request of the student if circumstances warrant further delay. 4. If the instructor is unavailable, the department chair, upon request of the student will make appropriate arrangements for the student to complete the course requirements. 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 895. It is the responsibility of the instructor or department chair concerned to submit the grade promptly upon completion of the conditions of the Incomplete Contract. 6. The 'I' cannot be removed through re-registration for the course or through credit by examination. An 'I' mark is not used in the computation of quality points or cumulative grade point averages. Computation of Grade Point Average GPA is computed by dividing the total number of quality points accumulated in courses for which a grade of A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F, or XF has been assigned by the total number of credits attempted in those courses. Courses for which a mark of P, S, I, NGR or W has been assigned are not included in computing the GPA. Each letter grade has a numerical value: A+=4, A=4, D=1, D- = 0.7; F = 0. Multiplying this value by the number of credits for a particular course gives the number of quality points earned for that course. See Repeat Policy to determine the effect of repeated courses in the calculation of GPA. Repeat Policy The following Campus Repeat Policy applies to ALL courses that may not be repeated for additional credit. 1. The following students are required to follow the new repeat policy: a. All new freshmen who began at University of Maryland , College Park Fall 1990 and after. b. Transfer students from schools other than Maryland community colleges who began at University of Maryland , College Park , Fall 1990 and after. This includes transfer students from another University of Maryland institution. 2. There is a limit to the number of times a student may repeat a course. Students may have one repeat of any course in which they earned an A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F, P, S, W, NGR or Audit; they cannot be registered (after the schedule adjustment period) for any given course more than twice. A students deans office may grant an exception allowing an additional course repeat. In this case, students must present a plan for successfully completing the course. All attempts will be counted toward the total limit for repeatable credits. Note : Students may not choose the Pass-Fail option when re-registering for a course or re-register for a course in which a grade of I has been noted. 3. Students may repeat no more than 18 credits. Additionally, if a student withdraws from all courses during a semester, those courses are not included in this limit. 4. The grade point average will include all attempts at a given course that result in a grade of A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, or F. However, to help freshmen and transfer students adjust to the University of Maryland , College Park , the following two exceptions allow for the cumulative GPA to be calculated so that only the higher grade is included: a. When the repeated course was taken within the students first semester at University of 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 90Maryland, College Park, or b. When the repeated course was taken within the students first 24 credit hours attempted (including transfer credits) or within the semester during which the student reached the 24th credit hour attempted. Advanced Placement Exam credits do not count toward the 24 credit count. 5. Any grade earned in prior attempts of a repeated course will appear on the student's transcript, regardless of whether the grade is dropped from, or included in, the cumulative grade point average. 6. Repeat by transfer: If a student repeats by transfer a course that was taken before or during the semester in which the student reached 24 credits attempted (including transfer credits) and the transfer grade is higher, then the original grade in the course will be excluded from the GPA calculation. a. If the course was taken after the semester in which the student reached 24 credits attempted, the original grade remains in the GPA calculation. Repeat Policy Prior to Fall 1990: The following students follow the previous repeat policy: Students who began at University of Maryland, College Park, before the Fall 1990 semester (including students who enter University of Maryland, College Park for summer 1990). Transfer students who began at a Maryland community college before Fall 1990. UMBC College of Engineering students who began before 1990. The highest grade received in the repeated course is used to calculate the GPA. A student may repeat any course; however no student may be registered for a course more than three times. If a student repeats a course in which he or she has already earned a mark of A, B, C, D, P, or S, the subsequent attempt shall not increase the total hours earned toward the degree. Only the highest mark will be used in computation of the student's cumulative average. Under unusual circumstances, the student's dean may grant an exception to this policy. Academic Clemency Policy Undergraduate students who return to the University of Maryland , College Park in pursuit of their initial baccalaureate degree after a separation of five calendar years, may petition the appropriate dean to have a number of previously earned grades and credits removed from the calculation of their cumulative grade point average. Up to 16 credits and corresponding grades from courses previously completed at the University of Maryland , College Park , will be removed from calculation of the grade point average and will not be counted toward graduation requirements. The petition for clemency must be filed in the first semester of return to the institution. Approval is neither automatic nor guaranteed. Honors (Dean's List) Semester Academic Honors (Dean's List) are awarded to students who - within any given semester (excluding winter and summer terms) - complete 12 or more credits with a semester GPA of 3.5 or 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 91higher. This recognition is noted on the student's academic record. Please Note: Courses with grades of P and S are excluded from the calcuation. Academic Probation and Dismissal Consistent with the University of Maryland Student Academic Success - Degree Completion Policy, it is the intent of the University that its students make satisfactory progress toward their degree objectives, and achieve academic success. If a student has special circumstances that make it impossible to complete a normal course load, the student must meet with an advisor to discuss the circumstances, the student's plans for continued progress toward a degree, and the implications for continued enrollment. The following guidelines for retention of students refer separately to semester (Fall and Spring) and Winter or Summer terms: a. Academic retention is based solely on grade point average (GPA). A minimum of 120 successfully completed course credits is required for graduation in any degree curriculum. Individual colleges, schools, and departments may establish higher requirements for graduation. Students must consult the appropriate college, school, or department for specific information. b. Satisfactory Performance is defined as the achievement of a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or above. Students whose semester GPA falls below 2.0 are encouraged to meet with their advisors regarding the development of a plan that will appropriately respond to the students academic difficulties and lead to academic improvement. Individual colleges, schools and departments may establish separate requirements for mandatory advising. Students must consult the appropriate college, school, or department for specific information. c. Unsatisfactory Performance is defined as the achievement of a cumulative GPA of less than 2.0. Students will be placed on Academic Probation following any semester in which a 2.0 cumulative GPA is not achieved. Normally, students will be Academically Dismissed if they are unable to raise their cumulative GPA to 2.0 or higher at the end of their probationary semester. Academic Probation : Students will be placed on academic probation if their cumulative GPA falls below 2.0. Normally, student is expected to attain a 2.0 cumulative GPA at the end of any probationary semester. Students who fail to achieve a 2.0 cumulative GPA at the end of their probationary semester may be academically dismissed, depending on their credit level as detailed below. 1. Students who have earned 60 credits or more will be dismissed from the University in the event their cumulative GPA remains below 2.0 at the end of their probationary semester. Students who are on probation and attain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 at the end of a winter or summer term will not be subject to dismissal in the subsequent semester. 2. Students who are on academic probation and have earned fewer than 60 credits will be permitted to continue on academic probation if a minimum semester GPA of 2.0 is achieved in each semester of probation. a. Full-time students must complete 9 or more credits in each semester of probation. A completed credit is defined as credit for any course in which a student receives a grade of A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-. F, P, or S. 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 92b. Students who meet this requirement will be permitted to continue on probation until the close of the semester (excluding winter and summer terms) in which they attain a cumulative GPA of 2.0. c. However, students who are on probation will be dismissed if they have not achieved a cumulative GPA of 2.0 at the end of the semester in which they complete 60 credits. d. Students who are on probation and attain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 at the end of a winter or summer term will not be subject to dismissal in the subsequent semester. 3. The Office of the Registrar will notify students when they are placed on academic probation. Such notices will include a requirement that the students consult an academic advisor in their colleges early in the probationary semester and in no event later than the beginning of the early registration period for the next semester. The Office of the Registrar will notify the colleges of students who are placed on academic probation and will note the academic probationary status on the students academic record. a. The academic advisors will assist students in developing appropriate plans for achieving satisfactory academic performance. b. Students who are placed on probation will not be allowed to add or drop courses, or register without the approval of an academic advisor in their college. Academic Dismissal : 1. Students who have earned 60 or more credits will be dismissed if their cumulative GPA remains below 2.0 for two consecutive semesters (excluding winter and summer terms). Students who attain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 in the preceding winter or summer term will not be subject to dismissal. 2. Students who have earned fewer than 60 credits will be dismissed following any probationary semester in which they fail to attain a minimum 2.0 semester GPA and complete the requisite credits detailed under Academic Probation. Students who attain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 in the preceding winter or summer term will not be subject to dismissal. 3. Students who have been academically dismissed and who are reinstated will be academically dismissed again if a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 is not achieved by the end of the first semester after reinstatement. Reinstated students will not be allowed to add or drop courses, or to register during any semester without the approval of an academic advisor in their college, unless a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 is achieved. 4. The Office of the Registrar will notify the appropriate University offices when students are academically dismissed and will note the dismissal on the student's academic record. 5. The Student Success Office will notify students via email. The email will include a statement that registration for the next semester (excluding winter or summer terms) will be canceled. Application for Academic Reinstatement : 1. Students who have been dismissed may apply to the Faculty Petition Board for reinstatement on the grounds of mitigating circumstances, such as (i) demonstrated progress toward a degree by successful completion of 24 degree-applicable credits in the preceding year, (ii) continuing improvement in the cumulative grade point average, and (iii) progress in general education and major requirements. 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 932. The application for reinstatement must include a written statement explaining the circumstances leading to dismissal and a proposed plan to remedy those circumstances. Students are encouraged to consult with their academic advisors prior to submitting their applications to the Faculty Petition Board. 3. Applications for reinstatement can be completed at http://studentsuccess.umd.edu. Faculty Petition Board : 1. The Student Success Office is responsible for submitting the reinstatement applications for review to the Faculty Petition Board, which is comprised of tenured faculty appointed by the Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost. The Board is the sole arbiter of reinstatement applications. 2. The Faculty Petition Board has the discretion to establish the terms for reinstatement, including the requirements for achieving academic improvement and developing an academic plan for success. 3. The Student Success Office will forward the Boards decision to students at their permanent addresses. Dismissal of Delinquent Students : The university reserves the right to request at any time the withdrawal of a student who cannot or does not maintain the required standard of scholarship, or whose continuance in the university would be detrimental to his or her health, or the health of others, or whose conduct is not satisfactory to the authorities of the university. Additional information about the dismissal of delinquent students may be found in the Code of Student Conduct. Attendance and Assessment/Examinations Attendance Medically Necessitated Absences from Class The university expects each student to take full responsibility for his or her academic work and academic progress. The student, to progress satisfactorily, must meet all of the requirements of each course for which he or she is registered. Students are expected to attend classes regularly, for consistent attendance offers the most effective opportunity open to all students to gain command of the concepts and materials of their courses of study. Except as provided below, absences will not be used in the computation of grades, and the recording of student absences will not be required of the faculty. 1. It is the policy of the university to excuse the absences of students that result from the following causes: illness of the student, or illness of a dependent as defined by Board of Regents policy on family and medical leave; religious observance (where the nature of the observance prevents the student from being present during the class period); participation in university activities at the request of university authorities; and compelling circumstance beyond the students control. Students claiming excused absence must apply in writing and furnish documentary support for their assertion that absence resulted from one of these causes. 2. In some courses, attendance and in-class participation are ongoing requirements and an integral part of the work of the course. In other courses, occasional in-class assessments may occur, sometimes without advance notice. It is the responsibility of the instructor to inform each class at the beginning of the semester of the nature of in-class participation expected and the effect of absences on the evaluation of the student's work in the course. 3. 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 94Absences in courses where in-class participation is a significant part of the work of the course shall be handled by the instructor in the course in accordance with the general policy of his or her academic unit. 4. Permanent changes in the scheduling or location of classes must be approved by the chair, the director or the dean of the department, non-departmentalized school or college, as appropriate.5. The university shall excuse class absences that result from a student's illness, provided the student complies with the procedures below. Procedures vary depending on the length and frequency of the absence and whether the absence occurs during a Major Scheduled Grading Event.6. Major Scheduled Grading Events and Prolonged Absences . Instructors shall identify in writing all Major Scheduled Grading Events pertaining to each course at the beginning of the semester. Students who miss a Major Scheduled Grading Event due to illness or who have a prolonged absence due to illness (multiple consecutive absences due to the same illness) shall be required to provide his or her instructor with written documentation of the illness from the University Health Center or from his or her own health care provider. The University Health Center or health care provider shall verify dates of treatment and indicate the dates the student was unable to meet academic responsibilities.7. Excused Absences from Class. Except during a Major Scheduled Grading Event, students may be excused from a single lecture, recitation or laboratory session one time per course per semester for a medically necessitated reason. The student should make a reasonable attempt to inform the instructor of his/her illness prior to the class, and present his or her instructor with a self-signed note attesting to the date of his or her illness. This note must include an acknowledgement: (a) that the information provided is true and correct, and (b) that the student understands that providing false information to University officials is a violation of Part 9(h) of the Code of Student Conduct.8. Written Absence Policies. Students who have more than one non-consecutive medically necessitated absence should comply with the requirements of the written absence policy applicable to each class. Instructors shall adopt a written policy addressing non-consecutive student absences for medically necessitated reasons at the beginning of each semester. Instructors should specify the nature of information and the documentation they require from students.9. Resolution of Problems. A student who wishes to contest a decision by the instructor should consult with the instructor's Department Chair and the Dean's Office of the college as necessary.10. www.president.umd.edu/policies/docs/V-100G.pdf Assessment 1. The university provides students with excused absences the opportunity to reschedule significant assessments, except in cases where the nature of the assessment precluded the possibility of rescheduling, OR to perform a substitute assignment without penalty. An instructor is not under obligation to offer a substitute assignment or to give a student a make-up assessment unless the failure to perform was due to an excused absence, that is, due to illness (of the student or a dependent), religious observance (where the nature of the observance prevents the student from being present during the class period), participation in university activities at the request of university authorities, or compelling circumstances beyond the students control. Students claiming excused absence must apply in writing and furnish documentary support for their assertion that absence resulted from one of these causes. 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 95The make-up assessment or substitute assignment must be at a time and place mutually agreeable to the instructor and student, cover only the material for which the student was originally responsible, and be at a comparable level of difficulty with the original assessment. In the event that a group of students requires the same make-up assessment or substitute assignment, one time and place may be scheduled. The make-up assessment or substitute assignment must not interfere with the student's regularly scheduled classes or in-class final examination. Students who have a concern regarding religious observances should see their instructors at the start of the semester. Although the university attempts to accommodate the religious beliefs of all of its members, it functions within a secular environment and is limited in the extent to which it can interrupt its normal operations. The president shall determine when it is appropriate for the campus community to restrict rescheduling examinations or other significant assessments on the dates of religious observance. At this time, examinations or other significant assessments may not be scheduled on Rosh Hoshanah, Yom Kippur, Good Friday, or the first two days of Passover. In cases of dispute, the student may appeal to the chair, the director or the dean of the department, non-departmentalized school or college offering the course within one week from the date of the refusal to schedule a make-up assessment. In those instances where the instructor is the chair, director or dean, the appeal shall be made to the next higher administrative officer, whose decision shall be final. 2. The student must notify his or her instructor of the reason for absence as soon as possible. Where the reason for absence from a scheduled assessment is known well in advance (for example, in cases of religious observance or participation in university activities at the request of university authorities), the student must inform the instructor by the end of the schedule adjustment period. Prior notification is especially important in connection with final examinations, since failure to reschedule a final examination before conclusion of the final examination period may result in loss of credits during the semester. Where the reason is not known well in advance (for example, in cases of illness or compelling circumstances beyond the students control), the student must inform the instructor as soon as the reason develops, or as soon as possible after its development. 3. Ordinarily, assessments are given during class hours in accordance with the regularly scheduled (or officially arranged) time and place of each course. No less than seven calendar days notice shall be given for assessments scheduled at other times and places. It shall be the instructors responsibility to ensure that the change in schedule does not interfere with any students regularly scheduled classes or in-class final examinations. It is the responsibility of the student to be informed concerning the dates of announced quizzes, tests, and examinations. Performance assessments may take a variety of forms and need not be classroom-based written examinations. 4. A final examination shall be given in every undergraduate course. Exceptions may be made with the written approval of the chair, the director or the dean of the department, non-departmentalized school or college, as appropriate. However, a students final course grade shall be based on a combination assessments that is at least the equivalent of a comprehensive final examination. No final examination or equivalent may be given or due during the last week of classes. All in-class final examinations must be held on the date and at the time listed in the official final examination schedule. Out-of-class final examination or equivalent assessments shall be due on the date and at a time listed in the official final examination schedule. 5. A student may seek to reschedule final examinations so that he or she has no more than three (3) examinations on any given day. It is the responsibility of the student to initiate the rescheduling or be responsible for taking the examination as originally scheduled. When rescheduling is desired, the student should first contact his or her class instructor(s). A student who encounters difficulty rescheduling examinations with his or her instructors is advised to contact his or her respective Dean's Office. Faculty are expected to accommodate students with legitimate rescheduling requests. 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 966. The chair, the director or the dean of the department, non-departmentalized school or college, as appropriate, is responsible for the adequate administration of assessments in courses under his or her jurisdiction. 7. No in-class assessment shall exceed the allotted time for a regularly scheduled class period. In the case of in-class final examinations, the time allotted shall not exceed the scheduled final examination period. 8. Each student shall be given the instructions and performance requirements for all assessments intended to require more than one-half class period in a form translatable to hard copy, unless the chair, the director or the dean of the department, non-departmentalized school or college, as appropriate, has authorized another procedure. The instructions and requirements of the assessment shall be archived in an appropriate medium in a suitable place. 9. The following rules shall govern all in-class examinations, unless the instructor for a specific course stipulates alternate rules for that course. A breach of any of the rules shall constitute disruption of class, a disciplinary offense (Code of Student Conduct, section 9.m.), or may serve as the basis of an allegation of academic dishonesty. a. Students arriving late for an examination may not unreasonably disrupt the examination room. b. Students must leave all unauthorized materials (e.g., books, notes, calculators) with the proctor before being seated. c. Where seating arrangements are established by proctors, student must conform to these arrangements. d. Students may not return to an examination room after leaving, unless permission to do so has been granted by the proctor prior to the student's departure. e. Students must cease conversation prior to the passing out of examination papers and maintain silence during the entire examination period. f. Students must place examination papers face down on the writing desk until the examination is officially begun by the proctor. g. Students must keep examination papers flat on the writing desk at all times. h. Students at an examination must be prepared to show current university identification. 10. Each faculty member is to retain, for one full semester after a course is ended, the students final assessments in the appropriate medium. If a faculty member goes on leave for a semester or longer, or leaves the university, the final assessments and grade records for the course must be left with the chair, the director or the dean of the department, non-departmentalized school or college, as appropriate. Statement on Classroom Climate The University of Maryland values the diversity of its student body and is committed to providing a classroom atmosphere that encourages the equitable participation of all students. Patterns of 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 97classroom atmosphere that encourages the equitable participation of all students. Patterns of interaction in the classroom between the faculty member and students and among the students themselves may inadvertently communicate preconceptions about student abilities based on age, disability, ethnicity, gender, national origin, race, religion, or sexual orientation. These patterns are due in part to the differences the students themselves bring to the classroom. Classroom instructors should be particularly sensitive to being equitable in the opportunities they provide students to answer questions in class, to contribute their own ideas, and to participate fully in projects in and outside of the classroom. Of equal importance to equity in the classroom is the need to attend to potential devaluation of students that can occur by reference to demeaning stereotypes of any group and/or overlooking the contributions of a particular group to the topic under discussion. Joking at the expense of any group creates an inhospitable environment and is inappropriate. Moreover, in providing evaluations of students, it is essential that instructors avoid distorting these evaluations with preconceived expectations about the intellectual capacities of any group. It is the responsibility of individual faculty members to review their classroom behaviors, and those of any teaching assistants they supervise, to ensure that students are treated equitably and not discouraged or devalued based on their differences. Resources for self-evaluation and training for faculty members on classroom climate and interaction patterns are available from the Office of Human Relations. Transfer Credit For current University of Maryland , College Park students The Office of the Registrar posts all transfer credit that would be acceptable to any of the degree programs at the University of Maryland , College Park . The dean of the college in which the student is enrolled determines which transfer credits are applicable to the student's degree program. In general, credit from academic courses taken at institutions of higher education accredited by a regional accrediting association will transfer, provided that the course is completed with at least a grade of C- and the course is similar in content and level to work offered at College Park . The title of courses accepted for transfer credit will be noted on the students record; however, the grade will not. Grades from transferred courses are not included in the University of Maryland , College Park , grade point average calculation. See chapter 1 for additional information. Courses taken at other institutions while attending the University of Maryland , College Park 1. Courses taken at another institution may not be credited toward a degree without approval in advance by the dean of the college from which the student expects a degree. The same rule applies to registration in the summer program of another institution. Permission to Enroll in Another Institution forms are available in the office of the student's dean. This form must be submitted and approved by the college for any course which will eventually be added to the university transcript. 2. Courses taken at other University of Maryland Institutions For students who began their attendance at the University of Maryland , College Park in Fall 1989 or later, all course work taken at any University System of Maryland institution will be posted as transfer credit. For all students who attended Maryland prior to Fall 1989, courses taken at another University of Maryland Board of Regents institution (UMBC, UMAB, UMES, UMUC) prior to Fall 1989 will be included in the cumulative GPA. Courses taken at any other institution may not be credited toward a degree without advance approval. See #1 above for information. 3. USM Concurrent Inter-Institutional Registration Program 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 983. USM Concurrent Inter-Institutional Registration Program University undergraduate students participating in the Concurrent Inter-Institutional Registration Program should obtain permission from their dean. Course work counts as resident credit. Students participating in this program must be enrolled full time in a degree program at University of Maryland, College Park, for the semester in which these courses are taken. 4. Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area Courses taken through the Consortium are considered to be resident credit. See www.registrar.umd.edu/current/registration/consortium.html for more information. Transfer Credit Center The Transfer Credit Center provides articulation information and assistance to students and transfer advisors. More information is available in the section on Transfer Admission in chapter 1 and on the internet at www.tce.umd.edu . Graduation Applications and Commencement Honors Graduation Applications Each candidate for a degree or certificate must file a formal application with the Office of the Registrar. The deadline for application is the end of the schedule adjustment period for the semester in which the student plans to graduate, or at the end of the first week of the second summer session for August degrees. In all cases, graduation applications must be filed at the beginning of the student's final semester before receiving a degree. The graduation applications are available on the internet at www.my.umd.edu or at the Registrar's Office, 1st floor Mitchell Building . Commencement Honors Summa cum laude, magna cum laude and cum laude are the highest commencement honors that the University bestows for sustained excellence in scholarship. They are awarded to the top 10% of all students graduating in each college over the course of a year. Summa cum laude is awarded to students with a GPA equal to the highest two percent of all college graduates over the past three terms, magna cum laude to the next highest three percent, and cum laude to the following five percent. To be eligible for this recognition, at least 60 semester hours must be earned at the university or at a program in which credit earned is counted as University of Maryland , College Park, resident credit (contact the Office of the Registrar to determine program eligibility). No more than 6 credits taken pass/fail or satisfactory/fail shall count toward the 60-hour minimum. No student with a grade-point average of less than 3.3 will be considered for a commencement honor. Because grades for a term generally are officially recorded after the term's graduation day, computation of the student's GPA will not include grades for courses taken during the student's final semester at the university. However, the hours taken during that semester will apply toward the 60-hour requirement. Election to Phi Beta Kappa Organized in 1776, Phi Beta Kappa is the oldest and most widely respected academic honorary society in the United States. Invitation to membership is based on outstanding scholastic achievement in studies of the liberal arts and sciences. Student members are chosen entirely on the basis of academic excellence; neither extracurricular leadership nor service to the community is considered. Election is held twice a year, once in the fall and once in the spring semester. 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 99The process for election to Phi Beta Kappa involves a review in November for those who graduated the previous August or those who will graduate in December, and a review in March for those graduating in May. For juniors the review occurs in March. The review is conducted by a select committee of faculty members representing the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. The committee reviews transcripts of all students with qualifying grade point averages. Whether a student qualifies for membership in Phi Beta Kappa depends on the quality, depth, and breadth of the student's record in liberal courses. The final decision for election rests with the faculty committee and faculty Phi Beta Kappa members. Attention Students who are under the General Education Program Requirements The way in which Phi Beta Kappa criteria will apply to courses in the General Education Program ( www.gened.umd.edu/for-students/gened-students.php ) is being determined. Any changes to the criteria will be posted at: www.ugst.umd.edu/pbk .html as soon as known. All new freshmen starting fall 2012 are under the General Education Requirements. Transfer and other students should visit: www.gened.umd.edu/documents/GenEdTransferPolicy.pdf to determine whether they are under CORE or General Education Program Requirements. Requirements for consideration of membership in Phi Beta Kappa at the University of Maryland, College Park campus chapter include: 1. Grade Point Average: For seniors a grade point average of at least 3.75 overall as well as in all liberal arts and sciences courses taken. For juniors the minimum grade point average is at least 3.85. National PBK rules, however, require that no more than 20 percent of the students elected in any one year can be juniors, so the actual minimum grade point average for junior admission may be higher than 3.85. 2. Residence: At least 60 credit hours must be taken at the University of Maryland, College Park. 3. Liberal Courses: For seniors, at least 90 credit hours in courses in the liberal arts and sciences (where \"liberal\" courses are to be distinguished from professional or technical courses), at least 45 of which must be taken at the University of Maryland, College Park. For juniors, at least 75 total credit hours must be completed, at least 60 of which are in courses in the liberal arts and sciences; of these, at least 45 must be taken at the University of Maryland, College Park. Students would ordinarily be majors in one of the programs in the liberal arts and sciences. However, students with the requisite number of liberal credit hours can be admitted if they have completed at least 5 courses (15 credit hours or more) for seniors and for juniors in a single liberal arts and sciences department/program at UMCP. 4. Required courses: One semester of mathematics, which must be fulfilled by college-level credit hours (including AP or IB credit, but not exemption by SAT), and two college semesters of the same foreign language at the elementary level, or at least one semester above that level. The language requirement may also be satisfied by completion of four years of the same language other than English at the high-school level or above, or the equivalent. Students with such a foreign language background who wish to be considered for admission to Phi Beta Kappa should notify the Phi Beta Kappa office (2110 Marie Mount Hall) in writing and provide the appropriate documentation (an official high school transcript) prior to the month of consideration. Juniors providing late documentation (after March 1) will be considered only as seniors. 5. Distribution: The credit hours presented for Phi Beta Kappa must contain at least nine liberal arts credit hours in each of the three following areas: (a) arts and humanities, (b) behavioral and social sciences, (c) natural sciences and mathematics (including a laboratory science course). The 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 100laboratory science course cannot be fulfilled by AP or IB credit. All the courses in at least two of the three required areas must be completed at the University of Maryland, College Park, and in the remaining area no more than one AP or IB course can be used to fulfill the requirement. In general, Phi Beta Kappa will accept the CORE classification of courses. In satisfying the distribution requirement, however, a maximum of one course that satisfies multiple CORE categories, allotted to the category that helps the student the most, can be used. AP or IB History courses will be considered as satisfying only the arts and humanities requirement. Students with more challenging courses and moderately high grade point averages are preferred by the committee to those with higher grade point averages but a narrow range of courses. Minimal qualifications in more than one area may preclude election to Phi Beta Kappa. Recommended Criteria Include: Regular grades (rather than pass/fail) in mathematics, foreign language courses, and distribution areas. Some traditional social sciences and humanities courses that require written essays and papers. (Note that internships may be counted as professional courses and not as liberal courses). Meeting the above requirements does not guarantee election to Phi Beta Kappa. The judgment of the resident faculty members of Phi Beta Kappa on the quality, depth, and breadth of the student's record is the deciding factor in every case. Any questions about criteria for election to Phi Beta Kappa (including equivalency examinations in foreign languages) should be directed to the Phi Beta Kappa Office, Dr. Denis Sullivan, and 301-405-8986. Degree Information Degree Requirements The requirements for graduation vary according to the character of work in the different colleges, schools, departments and academic units. It is the responsibility of the colleges, schools, departments and other academic units to establish and publish clearly defined degree requirements. Responsibility for knowing and meeting all degree requirements for graduation in any curriculum rests with the student. Specific degree requirements are listed in this catalog under the college and/or department as appropriate. Each student should check with the proper academic authorities no later than the close of the junior year to ascertain his or her standing with respect to advancement toward a degree. For this purpose, each student should be sure to review their semester grades and unofficial transcript on the MyUM website ( www.my.umd.edu ) at the close of each semester or request a semester grade report. 1. Residency Requirement a. All candidates for undergraduate degrees from the University of Maryland , College Park , must take a minimum of 15 credits in courses numbered 300 or above, including at least 12 credits in the major field. b. All candidates for undergraduate degrees from the University of Maryland, College Park must take a minimum of 30 credits in residence. Normally these 30 credits will be the final 30 credits counted toward the degree. However, credits from University-approved study abroad and 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 101degree. However, credits from University-approved study abroad and internship programs, and a maximum of 6 credits that are not part of such programs, may be included in the final 30 if approved in advance by the dean of the academic unit from which the student expects to receive the degree. 2. Enrollment in Majors A student who is eligible to remain at the University of Maryland , College Park , may transfer among curricula, colleges, or other academic units except where limitations on enrollments have been approved. By the time they complete 60 credits, students are expected to declare a degree-granting major. Students must be enrolled in the major program from which they plan to graduate, when registering for the final fifteen hours of the baccalaureate program. This requirement also applies to the third year of the combined, pre-professional degree programs. Also see information on double majors and double degrees elsewhere in this chapter. 3. Credit Requirements No baccalaureate degree will be awarded in instances where fewer than 120 credit hours have been earned. Many undergraduate curricula at the University of Maryland, College Park, require more than 120 credits. It is the responsibility of each student to familiarize himself or herself with the requirements of particular curricula. The student is urged to seek advice on these matters from the departments, colleges, or the Office of the Dean for Undergraduate Studies. To earn a baccalaureate from the University of Maryland , College Park , a minimum of 30 credits must be taken in residence (see above). 4. Grade Point Average A minimum cumulative 2.0 grade point average is required for graduation in all curricula. A higher average may be required by the individual department, college, school, or program. Students who matriculated to the University in Fall 2012 and after must have a minimum C (2.00) cumulative grade point average across all courses used to satisfy major degree requirements, minor requirements, and undergraduate certificate requirements. Individual department, college, school, or program requirements may exceed this minimum. 5. Completion of Interrupted Degree Students whose registration at the University of Maryland, College Park, has lapsed for more than 10 years shall be required to complete a minimum of 15 credit hours at College Park after their return to campus in order to earn a baccalaureate degree. Recommendations about courses needed to satisfy the remaining degree requirements will be made at the department level, with approval of the Dean's Office required. The reason for requiring these credits is that many fields change sufficiently in 10 years to require that students take current courses if they are to be awarded a current degree. Exceptions to the requirement for a minimum of 15 credits earned at College Park upon return to the campus can be recommended by the Deans for approval in the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. Student Academic Success-Degree Completion Policy The goal of the Student Academic Success-Degree Completion Policy is to promote undergraduate student success. The policy establishes a structured framework to guide all students to completion of an undergraduate degree within a reasonable period of time. Academic units provide 4-year templates that students can use to develop a program of study that will meet the course requirements for a degree. Students are responsible for developing plans of study, with the assistance of their 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 102academic advisers. Academic units monitor student progress and assist students at risk of falling behind benchmarks in their plans. The policy in essence establishes a process to provide a pathway to completion of a degree for each student, initially created and then adjusted over time as needed to meet each students particular circumstances. The policy is described in more detail in the section on Academic Advising. (References to the policy www.ugst.umd.edu/academicsuccess.html and to frequently asked questions: www.ugst.umd.edu/faqs-successpolicy.html ). Minors Minors afford students the opportunity to pursue a limited but structured concentration in a coherent field of study outside their major. The minor may be a truncated version of a major or a distinctive intellectual subset of a discipline. Minors are not offered in every field of study. Students should inquire with departments for current availability of minors or see individual listings on this site. The structures of minors vary in detail, but, with rare exceptions, they all require no fewer than 15 and no more than 24 credits with at least 9 credits in upper division courses (300 level or above). No more than six credits (or two courses) may be applied to satisfy both the requirements of a minor and a major program. No course may be used to satisfy the requirements of more than one minor. All courses taken for a minor must be completed with a minimum grade of C-. A minimum C (2.00) cumulative grade point average across all courses used to satisfy the minor is also required. To ensure appropriate academic advising, students who wish to pursue a minor should inform both the college responsible for their major and the unit offering the minor as early as possible, but in no case later than one full academic year before the expected date of graduation. When a student has completed all requirements for the minor, the unit offering the minor shall notify the student's college, which verifies that the student has met all requirements and officially notifies the Registrar's Office. The completion of a minor is posted on the student's official transcript only when the student completes all requirements for the bachelor's degree. In February 2004, the University Senate voted to phase out academic citations and replace them with minors. Students pursuing an academic citation should contact the respective department or program for information on this conversion process. Second Majors and Second Degrees Second majors A student who wishes to complete a second major concurrently with his or her primary major of record must obtain written permission in advance from the appropriate departments or programs and colleges. As early as possible, but in no case later than one full academic year before the expected date of graduation, the student must file with the department or programs involved and with the appropriate deans, formal programs showing the courses to be offered to meet requirements in each of the majors and supporting areas as well as those of the college and general education programs. A student who wishes to add a Limited Enrollment Program as a second major must do so at the earliest possible opportunity to assure that specific credit and GPA requirements can be met. In order to obtain approval, students must complete all of the requirements specified for both the primary and secondary major. Courses taken for one major may be counted as appropriate as part of the degree requirements for the general education programs. If two colleges are involved in the double major program, the student must designate which college will be responsible for the maintenance of records and certification of general education requirements. Final approval of a double major program must be obtained from each of the appropriate departments and college(s). 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 103Second Degrees Taken Simultaneously A student who wishes to receive two bachelor's degrees simultaneously must satisfactorily complete the regularly prescribed requirements of both degree programs and a minimum of 150 credits (180 credits if one of the degrees is in Special Education). At least 18 of the credits applied to one degree must be in course work not applied to the requirements of the other degree program. As early as possible, but in no case later than one full academic year before the expected date of graduation, the student must file with the department or programs involved, as well as with the appropriate deans, formal programs showing the courses to be offered to meet the major, supporting area, college, and general education programs. If two colleges are involved in the double degree program, the student must designate which college will be responsible for the maintenance of records and certification of general education requirements. Final approval of a double degree program must be obtained from each of the appropriate departments and college(s). Second Degrees Taken Sequentially A student who has completed the requirements for, and has received one baccalaureate and who wishes to earn a second degree from the university must satisfactorily complete all of the prescribed requirements for the second degree and enough additional credits so that the total, including all applicable credits earned at the university or elsewhere, is at least 150 credits (180 credits if one of the degrees is in Special Education). At least 18 of the credits applied to one degree must be in course work not applied to the requirements of the other degree program. In no case will a second baccalaureate be awarded to a student who has not completed a minimum of 30 credits in residence at the university. Post-Baccalaureate Second Degree Students who matriculate to the University with a bachelor's degree from any regionally accredited college or university will be considered to have satisfied the University's general education requirements, regardless of when the degree was received. Combined Bachelor's/Master's Programs In a combined bachelor's/master's program, some graduate level courses initially taken for undergraduate credit may also be applied towards the graduate credit requirements for a master's degree program at the University of Maryland. A bachelor's/master's program may be developed for an individual student, or it may be a structured program. Individual Student Bachelor's/Master's Program: A program may be developed by an individual student in consultation with his/her academic advisor. Such a program is available only to students whose academic performance is exceptional. It is to be developed according to the individual career interests and goals of the student and should be an integrated learning experience rather than merely the completion of a certain number of graduate and undergraduate credits. The program requires the approval of the directors of both the undergraduate and the graduate programs involved and of the Dean for Office of Undergraduate Studies and the Dean of the Graduate School . Normally, no more than nine credits of graduate courses applied to the bachelor's degree may be counted also for graduate credit in an individual student program. Courses to be double-counted must be at the 600 level or above and must be passed with at least a 'B' grade. Individual study courses, internships, or courses given credit by examination are not eligible. The credits to be double-counted will be designated as applicable to the graduate program after the student receives the bachelor's degree and 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 104matriculates in the Graduate School. This designation will be canceled if the student withdraws from the graduate program before completing the master's degree. Structured Bachelor's/Master's Program : A structured bachelor's/ master's program is an articulated curriculum combining an existing undergraduate program and an existing master's program at the University of Maryland, offered by the same or by different departments. Such a program is to be designed for students whose academic performance is exceptional and should be an integrated learning experience rather than merely the completion of a certain number of graduate and undergraduate credits. A proposal for such a program should be submitted by the college(s) housing the academic programs concerned and requires the approval of the Graduate Council, the Graduate Dean, the Senate PCC Committee, and the Provost. Necessary features of a structured bachelor's/master's program include the following: a. There must be specific requirements for admission to the combined program that speak to the exceptional performance of the students to be admitted. At a minimum, students accepted for the program must be clearly admissible to the graduate program portion. b. The program should be designed so as not to unduly delay the student's receipt of their bachelor's degrees. Taking graduate credits should not unduly limit the breadth of the student's experience through premature specialization. c. All requirements of the bachelor's program and of the master's program must be completed to receive the two degrees. Where appropriate, graduate courses taken while an undergraduate may substitute for courses required in the undergraduate major program. d. The student may be offered deferred admission to the graduate school at the end of the Junior year program, subject to completion of the senior year program in a timely fashion and with a specified level of achievement. Formal admission to the graduate school will require completion of all requirements for the bachelor's degree. e. The credits to be double-counted will be designated as applicable to the graduate program after the student receives the bachelor's degree and matriculates in the Graduate School . This designation will be canceled if the student withdraws from the graduate program before completing the master's degree. A structured bachelor's/master's program may normally include up to nine credits of graduate level courses (600 level and above) that are counted both for the bachelor's program and the master's program. More than nine double-counted credits may be allowed if both of the following conditions are satisfied. a. The additional graduate credits applied to the undergraduate program do not unduly limit the breadth of the student's experience through premature specialization. This condition may be satisfied, for example, if the graduate credits substitute for courses required in the undergraduate program that would have been taken in any case, but at a less advanced level. b. The master's program requires substantially more than thirty credits. This condition will be deemed to be satisfied if the combined program, with double-counting, still requires 150 or more credit hours to complete. 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 105Proficiency Examination Programs (Credit-by-Exam, CLEP) The University of Maryland, College Park offers new, continuing, and returning students several opportunities to earn college credit by demonstrating achievement in a subject field through examination. College Park recognizes three proficiency examination programs for credit: Advanced Placement (AP), Departmental Proficiency Examination Program (Credit-by-Examination), and College-Level Examination Program (CLEP). Undergraduate students may earn a total of up to one-half of the credits required for their degree through examination. Usually, this is no more than 60 credits. Students are responsible for consulting with the appropriate dean or advisor about the applicability of any credits earned by examination to a specific degree program. Students should also seek assistance in determining which University of Maryland, College Park courses duplicate credits earned for an examination. Students will not receive credit for both passing an examination and completing an equivalent course. Advanced Placement (AP) Credit. For complete information about the applicability of AP exams and the assignment of credit, please see chapter 1. Departmental Proficiency Examination (Credit-by-Examination) College Park Departmental Proficiency Examinations, customarily referred to as credit-by-examination, are comparable to comprehensive final examinations in a course. Although the mathematics department receives the most applications for credit by examination, many departments will provide examinations for certain of their courses. Initial inquiry as to whether an examination in a specific course is available is best made at the academic department which offers the course in question. If an examination for a course is available, the department will provide information regarding time and place, type of examination, and material which might be helpful in preparing for the examination. An undergraduate who passes a departmental proficiency examination is given credit and quality points toward graduation in the amount regularly allowed in the course, provided such credits do not duplicate credit obtained by some other means. After making arrangements with the department, apply through the Division of Letters and Sciences, 1117 Hornbake Library, 301-405-2793. Policies governing credit by examination: 1. The applicant must be formally admitted to the University of Maryland, College Park. Posting of credit earned, however, will be delayed until the student is registered. 2. Departmental Proficiency Examinations may not be taken for courses in which the student has remained registered at the University of Maryland, College Park, beyond the Schedule Adjustment Period even with a transcript notation of W. 3. Departmental Proficiency Examinations may not be used to change grades, including Incompletes and Withdrawals. 4. Application for credit-by-examination is equivalent to registration for the course; however, the following conditions apply: a. A student may cancel the application at any time prior to completion of the examination with no entry on his/her permanent record. (Equivalent to the schedule adjustment period.) b. The instructor makes the results of the examination available to the student prior to formal submission of the grade. Before final submission of the grade, the student may elect not to have this grade recorded. In this case, a mark of W is recorded. (Equivalent to the drop period.) c. No examination may be attempted more than twice. 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 106c. No examination may be attempted more than twice. d. The instructor must certify on the report of the examination submitted to the Office of the Registrar that copies of the examination questions (or identifying information in the case of standardized examinations), and the students answers have been filed with the chair of the department offering the course. 5. If accepted by the student (see 4b above), letter grades earned through credit-by-examination are entered on the student's transcript, and are used in computing his/her cumulative grade point average. A student may elect to take a credit-by-examination Pass-Fail only if the credit fulfills an elective in the student's degree program. No college, major, field of concentration, or general education program requirement may be taken under the pass-fail option. Please refer to the Pass-Fail policy under the Records section in this chapter. College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) The College-Level Examination Program (CLEP) recognizes college-level competence achieved outside the college classroom. Two types of CLEP tests are available: General Examinations, which cover the content of a broad field of study; and Subject Examinations, which cover the specific content of a college course. Credit can be earned and will be recognized by College Park for some CLEP General or Subject Examinations, provided satisfactory scores are attained. Credits earned under CLEP are not considered residence credit, but are treated as transfer credit. CLEP exams are administered at CLEP testing centers throughout the country. The University of Maryland, College Park is a CLEP Test Center (Test Center Code: 5814). To obtain an application or additional information, contact the CLEP Administrator in the Counseling Center, Room 0106A Shoemaker Hall, (301-314-7688), or write to CLEP, CN 6600, Princeton, NJ, 08541-6600. Students who want to earn credit through CLEP must request their official score reports to be sent to the Office of Undergraduate Admission, Mitchell Building, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742-5235. (The University of Maryland, College Park, Score Recipient Code is 5814.) Policies governing CLEP are as follows: 1. A student must matriculate at the university before CLEP credits are officially posted. The posting will not be done until a student has established a record. 2. Each institution of the University System of Maryland establishes standards for acceptance of CLEP exemptions and credits. Students must check with the institution to which they will transfer to learn if they will lose, maintain, or gain credit. 3. College Park will award credit for a CLEP examination a. provided the examination was being accepted for credit here on the date the student took the examination, and b. provided that the examination was not taken during a students final 30 credits. The final 30 hours of credit are to be taken in residence, unless prior approval has been granted by the student's dean. 4. Credit will not be given for both completing a course and passing an examination covering substantially the same material. 5. Furthermore, credit will not be awarded for CLEP examinations if the student has previously completed more advanced courses in the same field. 6. CLEP examinations posted on transcripts from other institutions will be accepted if the 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 107examination has been approved by College Park and the scores reported are equal to or higher than those required by this institution. If the transcript from the prior institution does not carry the scores, it will be the responsibility of the student to request Educational Testing Service to forward a copy of the official report to the Office of Admissions. University awards credits for CLEP Examinations only as indicated on the chart provided in this chapter (if an examination is not listed, it is not accepted for credit at this institution). If you have questions about the applicability of specific credit to your program, consult the list provided in this catalog or contact your Dean's Office. To see the 2013-2014 CLEP Credit Awards and Course Equivalencies go to: www.umd.edu/catalog/attachments/CLEPCOREChart.pdf www.umd.edu/catalog/attachments/CLEPGenEdChart.pdf Registering for Classes Office of the Registrar Mitchell Building , 301-314-8240 www.testudo.umd.edu To attend classes at the University of Maryland , College Park , it is necessary to process an official registration. Specific registration dates and instructions are printed in the Registration Guide and on the MyUM website, www.my.umd.edu . Newly admitted students are invited, and strongly encouraged, to attend an orientation session (see chapter 3 for Orientation information). Advising and course registration are part of the orientation process. All newly admitted students must meet with an advisor prior to registration. Likewise, newly admitted freshmen and transfer students are required to provide proof of immunization for measles, rubella, mumps and tetanus/diphtheria. Additionally, Maryland law requires residence hall students to either provide proof of vaccination against meningococcal disease or seek an exemption from this requirement. Registration Process: Currently enrolled undergraduate students are invited to early registration by appointment. Students can register at, or anytime after, their assigned registration appointment date and time. Registration appointments for the Fall semester begin in April, and appointments for the Spring semester begin in late October. Registration can be processed on the MyUM web site (www.my.umd.edu ) or in person. Open registration follows early registration, and continues up to the first day of classes. During this time, students may process an original registration or make schedule adjustments. The schedule adjustment period begins on the first day of classes. All registration transactions, either on-line or in person, are final unless a student processes a cancellation of registration. Registration information for Summer Term, Winter Term, Freshmen Connection, and Professional Programs may be found at www.oes.umd.edu . Schedule Adjustment and Drop Period Schedule Adjustment: The schedule adjustment period is the first 10 days of classes for the fall and 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 108Schedule Adjustment: The schedule adjustment period is the first 10 days of classes for the fall and spring semesters, the first 5 days of classes for Summer Sessions I and II, and the first 3 days of classes for Winter Term and 3-week Summer Term sessions. Courses may be added, when space is available, during the schedule adjustment period, and will appear on the students permanent record along with other courses previously listed. Courses dropped during this period will not appear on the student's permanent record. Complete information on schedule adjustment and drop period for Summer Term, Winter Term, Freshmen Connection, and Professional Programs may be found at www.oes.umd.edu . Departments may identify courses or sections of courses (with the approval of the Office of the Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs), which after the first five days of the schedule adjustment period in Spring and Fall semesters, shall require faculty or departmental approval for students to add. During the schedule adjustment period full-time undergraduates may drop or add courses, or change sections or credit level without financial penalty provided they remain full-time students (registered for 12 or more credits). See www.registrar.umd.edu/current/registration/Schedule%20Adjustment.html for information and penalties associated with changing from full-time to part-time. Part-time undergraduates (fewer than 12 credits) may also add, drop and change sections, as well as change credit level, but they should consult the deadline section at www.registrar.umd.edu/current/Policies/deadlines2.html www.registrar.umd.edu/current/Policies/deadlines2.html to avoid incurring additional charges. Grading Method (including pass-fail) may be changed only during the schedule adjustment period. In the case of students who are advised in the Division of Letters and Sciences when Dean's approval is required, the Dean for Office of Undergraduate Studies shall assume the responsibilities normally delegated to the Dean. After Schedule Adjustment Courses may not be added without special permission of the department and the dean of the academic unit in which the student is enrolled. All courses for which the student is enrolled shall remain as a part of the student's permanent record. The student's status shall be considered full-time if the number of credit hours enrolled at this time is 12 or more. An official class list for each course being offered is issued to the appropriate department by the Office of the Registrar. Electronic rosters are provided to all faculty with email accounts. Students are not permitted to attend a class if their names do not appear on the class list. Instructors must report discrepancies to the Office of the Registrar. Drop Period The drop period for undergraduate students will begin at the close of the schedule adjustment period and terminate at the end of the tenth week of classes for the fall and spring semesters. Consult the deadline section at www.registrar.umd.edu/current/Policies/deadlines2.html for dates. During this period a student may drop a maximum of four credits. However, if the course carries more than four credits, the student may drop the entire course, or in the case of a variable credit 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 109course, reduce the credit level by up to four credits. Drops during this period will be recorded on the student's permanent record with a notation of W and will be considered to represent a single enrollment (one of two possible) in the course. This mark will not be used in the computation of a student's cumulative grade point average. Credit Hours and Maximum Semester Credits No baccalaureate curriculum requires fewer than 120 semester hours. The semester hour, which is the unit of credit, is the equivalent of a subject pursued one period a week for one semester. Two or three hours of laboratory or field work are equivalent to one lecture or recitation period. In order for undergraduate students to complete most curricula in four academic years, their semester load must range from 12 to 19 hours (30 to 36 hours each year) toward the degree. By policy, undergraduates may not exceed the following maximum credit loads without the prior approval of their Dean: 15 week semester: 20 credits in a 15 week semester (16 credits prior to the first day of classes) 6 Week Summer Term: 8 credits 3 Week Term (Summer or Winter): 4 credits Cancellation of Registration Students who register and later decide not to attend the University must cancel their registration with the Office of the Registrar prior to the official first day of classes. Failure to cancel registration will result in a financial obligation to the University of Maryland even though a student does not attend class. The University reserves the right to cancel registration for students who fail to meet their financial obligations. Concurrent Undergraduate-Graduate Registration An undergraduate degree seeking student at the University of Maryland may, with the approval of his or her Dean, the department and the instructor offering the course, and of the Graduate School, register for graduate courses (600 level and above) that will be recorded as for graduate credit only and that may be applied towards an advanced degree at this university or elsewhere. Students eligible for this option normally will have achieved junior standing, will have a GPA of at least 3.0, and will have successfully completed the prerequisite courses with a grade of 'B-' or better. The student must submit a plan of study that shows that taking graduate courses will not unduly delay completion of requirements for the bachelor's degree. The total of graduate and undergraduate credits attempted in any semester may not be more than eighteen. The graduate credits so earned will not count towards any of the requirements for the Baccalaureate degree. A maximum of twelve credits may be taken for graduate credit by a student while enrolled as an undergraduate. Undergraduate Credit for Graduate Level Courses Subject to requirements determined by the graduate faculty of the department or program offering the course, undergraduate degree-seeking students may register for graduate-level courses, i.e., those numbered from 600 to 898, with the exception of 799, for undergraduate credit. The student must 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 110numbered from 600 to 898, with the exception of 799, for undergraduate credit. The student must obtain the prior approval of the department and instructor offering the course. Students eligible for this option normally will have achieved Junior standing, will have a GPA of at least 3.0, and will have successfully completed the prerequisite courses with a grade of 'B-' or better. Enrollment in a graduate-level course does not in any way imply subsequent departmental or graduate school approval for admission into a graduate program, nor may the course be used as credit for a graduate degree at the University of Maryland . Withdrawal and Leave of Absence Students admitted to the University of Maryland are expected to make regular and consistent progress towards the completion of their degree. However, the University understands that in exceptional circumstances a student may find it necessary to completely withdraw from all classes. The University considers such an interruption to be very serious as it delays normal progress towards the degree. Students should not withdraw for frivolous reasons or to avoid the consequences of ignoring their academic responsibilities. Any student considering withdrawal is strongly encouraged to meet with his or her academic college advisor before leaving the University. Potential Implications: Withdrawing or taking a leave of absence from the University may have serious implications for international students, students receiving financial aid or students residing in on-campus housing. Students are advised to contact the appropriate offices before finalizing withdrawal or leave of absence plans. Student Financial Services Office, 1135 Lee Building , 301-314-9000 Department of Resident Life, 2100 Annapolis Hall, 301-314-2100 Office of International Services, 2111 Holzapfel Hall , 301-314-7740 Withdrawal: A withdrawal is available anytime between the first and last day of classes. Students must submit written notice of withdrawal to the Office of the Registrar no later than the last day of classes. In exceptional cases, a retroactive withdrawal may be granted based on documented requests in which extenuating circumstances significantly impaired the student's ability to complete the semester and officially withdraw by the established semester deadlines. Such circumstances inlcude, but are not limited to, medical or psychological causes. A student's return to the University is contingent upon the conditions outlined in Return to the University below. Leave of Absence: A leave of absence is a type of withdrawal and is available for students wishing to take time away from the University with the intention of returning the following semester. The leave of absence status is especially helpful for recipients of federal financial aid because they are not considered to be withdrawn provided they do return and complete the following semester. Students may apply for a leave of absence only during the last 60 days of the semester. A student's return to the University is contingent upon the conditions outlined in Return to the University below . Return to the University: Normally, a student may withdraw or take a leave of absence from the University only once during matriculation as an undergraduate. Students who find it necessary to leave the University are required to petition the Faculty Review Board in order to return. Students who have earned a minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA, with no previous withdrawal or leave of absence, are exempt from this requirement. Students who withdraw or take a leave of absence while on academic probation, or those returning from dismissal, are always required to petition the Faculty Review Board. For information on returning to the university, please see www.studentsuccess.umd.edu . 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 111Additional Withdrawal/Leave of Absence Information: The effective date of withdrawal or leave of absence for the purposes of refunds is the date that the notice is received by the Office of the Registrar. Notation of withdrawal/leave of absence and the effective date will be posted to the student's academic record. Instructors and college offices will be notified of all withdrawn students. The deadline date for submitting the withdrawal for each semester is the last day of classes. Students should contact the Student Success Office for reenrollment information. The repeat policy will not apply to courses taken during the academic semester from which the student is officially withdrawn. Military Call-ups: It is the intent of the University of Maryland , College Park , to facilitate the withdrawal or change in registration and the reenrollment of students who are called to active military duty during the semester. The student (or a representative) should take a copy of the military orders to the Office of the Registrar and process a withdrawal or change in registration papers. Detailed information about this process may be obtained from the Office of the Registrar. Withdrawal for active military service will have no effect on any subsequent request to withdraw from the University. Courses Taken at Other Institutions Courses taken at another institution may not be credited toward a degree program without prior approval of the dean of the college from which the student expects to earn a degree. Eligible students may enroll in courses at other universities via the University System of Maryland's Inter-Institutional Registration Program or the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area. Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area : The Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area consists of American University , The Catholic University of America, Corcoran College of Art and Design, Gallaudet University , Georgetown University, George Mason University , The George Washington University, Howard University , Marymount University , National Defense Intelligence College , National Defense University, Trinity University , University of the District of Columbia and the University of Maryland College Park. Students enrolled in degree-seeking programs at these institutions are able to attend certain classes at the other campuses and have the credit considered as resident credit at their home institutions. The intention is to allow students to take an occasional course to augment a program rather than to develop an individual program. Payment of tuition for courses will be made to the student's home campus however, special fees may be assessed by the host institution. Comparable courses offered at University of Maryland may not be taken through the Consortium. Currently registered, degree seeking University of Maryland students with at least junior standing may participate in the Consortium program according to the stipulations listed in the current edition of the Registration Guide. Enrollment in courses is available only on a space-available basis. Visiting students are expected to meet prerequisites or other criteria set by the host institution and comply with the host institution's registration procedures and deadlines. Golden ID students are not eligible to enroll in courses through the Consortium with waiver of fees. University of Maryland students may only enroll in courses offered on the campus of the host institution. Students interested in additional information about the Consortium program should review the current edition of the Registration Guide or contact the Consortium Coordinator on the first floor of the Mitchell Building .

Enrollment in courses is available only on a space available basis and visiting students are expected to meet prerequisites or other criteria set by the host institution. Payment of tuition for courses will be made to the student's home campus however special fees may be assessed by the host institution. Students interested in additional information about the Inter-Institutional Registration program should review the current edition of the Registration Guide or contact the Consortium Coordinator on the first floor of the Mitchell Building . Inter-Institutional Registration is only applicable for the Fall and Spring semesters. Student ID Numbers University of Maryland assigns all students a unique nine-digit university identification number (UID). The UID is the student identifier for most university transactions. Use of the social security number is limited to necessary business transactions or where it is required by law. See www.president.umd.edu/policies/docs/vi-2600A.pdf for the University of Maryland Policy on the Collection, Use and Protection of ID Numbers and a list of currently approved uses. Use of Email for Official Communication The University has adopted email as the primary means for sending official communications to students. Academic advisors, faculty, and campus administrative offices use email to convey important information and time-sensitive notices. All enrolled students are provided a University email address. Students are responsible for keeping their email address up to date or for forwarding email to another address. Failure to check email, errors in forwarding email, and returned email due to mailbox full or user unknown will not excuse a student from missing announcements or deadlines. Change of Address Students are expected to notify the Office of the Registrar of any change in their local, permanent or e-mail address. Use the internet to keep address information current and accurate. Change of address forms are available at the following places: MyUM website: www.my.umd.edu 4. Registration, Academic Requirements, and Regulations Page 113Office of the Bursar, Room 1115 or 1135, Lee Building Student Services Counter, first floor, Mitchell Building Please be advised that changing your permanent address could affect your residency status for tuition and billing purposes. For further information about these potential implications, please contact the Residency Classification Office at resclass@umd.edu. Identification Cards The photo ID card is issued at the time the student first registers for classes. This card is to be used for the entire duration of enrollment. Additionally, students who have food service contracts will use this photo identification card to access these services. Contact Dining Services directly for further information. The photo ID card can be used by students for admission to most athletic, social, and cultural events, to withdraw books from the libraries, and as a general form of identification on campus. University of Maryland photo ID cards will be replaced free of charge only when the most recent, active ID card is turned into the Office of the Registrar at the time of reissue AND: 1) the ID bar code is no longer visible or readable; or 2) the ID card has become worn and no longer functions properly. The replacement of an ID card will carry a charge of $20 if the student indicates that their card is lost, stolen, or the card has intentional damage (i.e. holes punched in the card, cards intentionally snapped in two, etc.). The Registrar's Office is available weekdays from 8:00am to 5:00pm in the First Floor Lobby of the Mitchell Building for requesting replacement cards.

Ability in mathematics is a critical measure of how well students are prepared to meet the challenges they will face in their lives beyond school. Must be attempted by 30 credits and successfully completed by 60 credits.* Analytic Reasoning: Courses in Analytic Reasoning foster a student's ability to use mathematical or formal methods or structured protocols and patterns of reasoning to examine problems or issues by evaluating evidence, examining proofs, analyzing relationships between variables, developing arguments, and drawing conclusions appropriately. If a student passes an Analytical Reasoning course that requires Fundamental Studies Math as a prerequisite, the Math requirement has also been fulfilled. Academic Writing: The Fundamental Studies Academic Writing requirement prepares students with a foundational understanding of the writing skills needed for success in further studies at Maryland and beyond. Must be attempted by 30 credits and successfully completed by 60 credits.* Professional Writing: The Fundamental Studies Professional Writing requirement strengthens writing skills and prepares students for the range of writing expected of them after graduation. Oral Communication: Human relationships, from the most formal to the most personal, rest in large measure on skilled listening and effective speaking. Skillful listening and speaking support success in personal relationships, educational undertakings, professional advancement, and civic engagement. * No exemption is allowed for SAT scores. Scores on AP and IB exams may provide exemption. Refer to the 2012-13 Undergraduate Catalog for exemption information: http://www.umd.edu/catalog/index.cfm Distributive Studies Experience a variety of disciplines. (8 courses, 25 credits) Natural Sciences History and Social Sciences Humanities Scholarship in Practice The Program has three additional categories that may be taken on their own or, through double-counting, may be rolled up into the Distributive Studies categories. Two of these comprise the Diversity requirement: Understanding Plural Societies and Cultural Competence. The third is the I-Series program which offers students two courses that deal with major issues. With double-counting, students will have a minimum of 40 credits in General Education. Natural Sciences courses introduce the concepts and methods of studying the natural world. Courses include the traditional physical and life sciences, environmental science, animal and avian science, and plant science, among others. One of the two courses selected must include a substantial, rigorous laboratory experience. History and Social Science courses introduce students to history and to the social science disciplines, with their combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. They include courses in criminology, economics, history, psychology, sociology, and other social sciences. Humanities courses study the history and the genres of human creativity. They include courses in literatures in any language, art and art history, classics, and music and music history, as well as in 5. General Education Requirements Page 117literatures in any language, art and art history, classics, and music and music history, as well as in the disciplines of linguistics and philosophy, among others. Scholarship in Practice courses engage students in applying a body of knowledge to create professional products or works of art. Architecture, business, education, engineering, and journalism offer courses that lead to products such as architectural designs, new technologies, innovative publications, new computer software, business plans, advertising campaigns, educational curricula, and bioengineering. Creative and artistic performance courses lead students to produce writing portfolios, plays, operas, dance productions, art exhibits, and creative media. Scholarship in Practice also includes courses that combine competency in speaking, writing, and translation in a foreign language. One of the two Scholarship in Practice courses selected must be outside the student's major requirements. To fulfill the Distributive Studies requirement: Students must complete two courses in each of the four Distributive Studies areas for a total of eight courses in Distributive Studies. One of the courses in the Natural Sciences must include a laboratory experience. Two of the eight courses must be I-Series courses. I-Series courses double-count with Distributive Studies. AP credit may not be used to satisfy the I-Series requirement. AP credit for Distributive Studies is limited to six of the eight courses. One of the two Scholarship in Practice courses must be outside the major requirements. Coursework within one's major is permitted to satisfy both the major and general education requirements. A Diversity requirement may be fulfilled by a course that is approved for both a Diversity category and for a Distributive Studies category. Diversity Explore human, social, and cultural differences. (2 courses, 4-6 credits that normally double-count with Distributive Studies) Understanding Plural Societies Cultural Competence To fulfill the Diversity requirement: Students must complete two Understanding Plural Societies courses (6 credits total) OR One Understanding Plural Societies course (3 credits) and one Cultural Competence course (1-3 credits). Courses fulfilling the Diversity requirement may double-count in an approved Distributive Studies category. Students will not be able to fulfill Understanding Plural Societies and/or Cultural Competence by a study abroad experience unless the study abroad course carries that specific designation. I-Series Choose from a unique suite of courses that form the cornerstone of Distributive Studies. (2 courses, 6 credits that double-count with Distributive Studies) The I-Series is the signature program of General Education at the University of Maryland. I-Series courses are lively and contemporary. They speak to important issues that spark the imagination, demand intellect, and inspire innovation. They challenge students to wrestle with big 5. General Education Requirements Page 118questions, and examine the ways that different disciplines address them. I-Series courses are not surveys of particular fields of knowledge. Instead, I-Series courses provide students with the basic concepts, approaches, and vocabulary of particular disciplines and fields of study as well as an understanding of how experts in those disciplines and fields employ terms, concepts, and approaches.

The third Sciences and Mathematics course may be another science selection or may be chosen from Mathematics and Formal Reasoning (MS) courses. 3. Social Sciences and History-three courses required: One course from Social or Political History (SH) and Two courses from Behavioral and Social Sciences (SB) 4. Interdisciplinary and Emerging Issues (CORE CODE: IE) OPTIONAL CORE DISTRIBUTIVE STUDIES CATEGORY EFFECTIVE BEGINNING FALL 2005 Details at: http://www.ugst.umd.edu/core/elements/DistrSt.html#IE IE is an optional CORE distributive studies category; Students may fulfill CORE requirements without taking an IE course. Only one IE course may be counted toward fulfilling CORE Distributive Studies requirements. Whether a student takes an IE course or not, total CORE Distributive Studies course and credit requirements remain the same: at least 9 courses and 28 credits. III. CORE Advanced Studies Two Courses (6 credits) Required Students may choose their two Advanced Studies courses from a wide range of upper-level offerings outside their majors. Good choices include courses that mesh with or expand educational goals or other interests, increase knowledge, and strengthen critical thinking and writing skills. CORE Advanced Studies Requirement: Two upper-level (300- or 400-level) courses outside the major taken after 60 credits. Students may substitute a CORE approved senior capstone course in their major or a senior or honors thesis for one of the two required Advanced Studies courses. Enrollment in CORE Capstone courses will be subject to departmental guidelines. The other course must be outside the major. Students completing double majors or double degrees will have fulfilled the campus Advanced Studies requirement, unless their primary major or college has additional requirements. The student's academic college determines whether or not a course is \"outside the major\" for the purpose of fulfilling CORE Advanced Studies. The following may NOT be used to fulfill Advanced Studies requirements: Professional Writing courses (courses that meet the Fundamental Studies upper-level writing requirement); 5. General Education Requirements Page 122courses used to meet Distributive Studies requirements; internships, practica, or other experiential learning types of courses; courses taken on a pass/fail basis. One independent studies course (minimum of three credits, outside the major) may be used toward Advanced Studies requirements as long as it is consistent with the rules above and the faculty member supervising the independent study agrees that it is appropriate for Advanced Studies. Notes: CORE Capstone courses must be taken within the major. A senior thesis (minimum of 3 credits) or successful completion and defense of an honors thesis in either the Honors College or a Departmental Honors Program (minimum of 3 credits) counts as CORE Capstone credit. See list of approved CORE Capstone courses at https://ntst.umd.edu/soc/ IV. CORE Human Cultural Diversity One Course (3 credits) Required See the CORE Diversity List in the online Schedule of Classes at https://ntst.umd.edu/soc/ Cultural Diversity courses focus primarily on: (a) the history, status, treatment, or accomplishment of women or minority groups and subcultures; (b) non-Western culture, or (c) concepts and implications of diversity. Note: A number of CORE Human Cultural Diversity courses also satisfy CORE Distributive Studies, Advanced Studies, or a college, major, and/or supporting area requirement.

The Colleges and Schools SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE, PLANNING AND PRESERVATION (ARCH) 1200 Architecture Building, 301-405-8000 www.arch.umd.edu Dean(s): Ingrid Farrell The School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation offers a four-year pre-professional undergraduate program leading to the Bachelor of Science degree in architecture. The School also offers graduate programs leading to the professional degrees of Master of Architecture, Master of Historic Preservation, Master of Community Planning, and Master of Real Estate Development, as well as joint professional degrees and certificates. The School offers a post-professional Master of Science in Architecture degree and a Ph.D. in Urban and Regional Planning and Design. Students graduating with the undergraduate major in architecture typically require two years to complete the curriculum leading to the professional degree in architecture. Please see the graduate catalog for more information on graduate programs at the School of Architecture. The School is a member of the Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture (ACSA). Students receive rigorous and comprehensive instruction from a faculty whose members are active in professional practice or research. Many faculty members have distinguished themselves across the professional spectrum and represent different approaches to architectural design. Their individual areas of expertise include architectural design and theory, history, architectural archaeology, technology, urban design and planning, and historic preservation. Visiting critics, lecturers, and the Kea Distinguished Professor augment the faculty; together they provide students with the requisite exposure to contemporary realities of architectural design. Special Advantages and Facilities Accreditations NAAB - In the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted a 6-year, 3-year, or 2-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards. Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may consist of a pre-professional undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree that, when earned sequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree. The University of Maryland School of Architecture, Planning & Preservation offers the following NAAB-accredited degree programs: 6. The Colleges and Schools Page 124M.Arch (pre-professional degree + 60 graduate credits) M.Arch (non-pre-professional degree + 109 credits) Facilities The school is housed in a modern building providing design workstations for each student, a 300 seat auditorium, and seminar and classroom facilities. The Great Space, an atrium at the center of the School, is the location for collaborate projects, design reviews, critiques, and a variety of events that that bring the architecture program together. Facilities include a well-equipped woodworking and model shop, computer labs, digital output and digital fabrication. The Architecture Library, one of the finest in the nation, offers convenient access to a current circulating collection of more than 24,000 volumes, 6,000 periodicals, and an extensive selection of reference materials. Rare books and special acquisitions include a collection relating to international expositions and the 11,000-volume National Trust for Historic Preservation Library. The Elizabeth D. Alley Visual Resources Collection includes a reserve collection of 500,000 slides on architecture, landscape architecture, urban planning, architectural science, and technology as well as audio-visual equipment for classroom and studio use.

COLLEGE OF ARTS AND HUMANITIES (ARHU) 1102 Francis Scott Key Hall, 301-405-2088 www.arhu.umd.edu Dean: Bonnie Thornton Dill 6. The Colleges and Schools Page 136The College of Arts and Humanities embraces a heterogeneous group of disciplines that study human experience, thought, expression and creativity. All value the development of critical thinking, fluent expression in writing and speech, sensitivity to ethical and aesthetic issues, and a complex understanding of history and culture. Departments and programs in Arts and Humanities prize vigorous intellectual debate in a diverse community.

As a truly interdisciplinary program, DCC challenges traditional divisions of knowledge and expertise. Our faculty and students come from all areas of study; yet we share a common passion for the digital world that goes beyond any particular tool or platform. We strongly value inclusivity and we embrace hybridity in both theory and practice. Often wearing more than one hat at the same time, we are architects, software designers, biologists, journalists, economists, artists, activists, engineers, and musicians to name just a few. As a living-learning program in the Honors College, DCC students form a close-knit residential community where intellectual excitement, creativity, and diverse ideas are brought together to explore emerging technologies and their impact on the world through experimental and creative projects in mobile media, sound and music composition, augmented reality, human-computer interaction, digital storytelling, and expanded cinema. The program is an innovative curriculum of 16 credits taken over the first two years with top-notch (and technologically sophisticated) faculty, including a practicum that culminates in a significant research project and/or a major creative effort. DCC aims to cultivate life long learners and critically engaged thinkers who will become the makers and doers of tomorrow, able to expand our notions of human potential - not merely technologically 6.

OACS operates five 20-seat instructional computer labs that offer a wide variety of popular software, including statistical and GIS packages. The labs also offer color and black-and-white printing through the campus' pay-for-print system. Student Engagement and Service Units Dean's Student Advisory Council The Dean's Student Advisory Council (DSAC) was formed in the fall of 2002. This council is charged with advising the dean on various topics affecting students and their educational and social 6. The Colleges and Schools Page 153experiences at the University of Maryland. Each academic year, the group takes on the responsibility of allocating the college's portion of the approved student technology fee. DSAC was assigned the primary role of deciding where those fees would be best applied in the college. DSAC also led the charge in the formation and founding of the college's Ambassadors Program, which has proven to be a successful addition and support system for the college and advising center. DSAC sponsored events to engage students with faculty have included the Annual Student-Faculty Dinner and Election Night Watch Party during the past Presidential election. There are also sponsored BSOS alumni and faculty day trips where students have an opportunity to network with former BSOS alumni in the place of business or to accompany faculty to venues in the greater Washington D.C. area for an out of the classroom experience. For the most recent Maryland Day, DSAC leaders helped the College roll out the \"Be the Solution\" campaign to promote the College and its associated departments and centers. This council consists of representatives from each department in the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences, the living/learning programs in the college, the Student Government Association, University Senate representatives for the college, and a peer advisor. Contact the Dean's Student Advisory Council: bsosdsac@umd.edu BSOS Ambassadors Ambassadors assist with the planning, coordination and execution of special events hosted by the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences. Ambassadors build a strong knowledge base of the behavioral and social science academic disciplines as well as other programs offered by the college so that they may inform prospective students and the public during special events. Additionally, by working with other ambassadors, faculty, staff and various campus professionals, ambassadors will have the opportunity for valuable leadership, networking and communication experience. Ambassadors receive two (2) course credits for the successful completion of a semester of duty and the fulfillment of the accompanied course, BSOS248A). In subsequent semesters, students may continue serving as an ambassador and earn additional credit for each full semester of service, assuming they maintain the necessary requirements set forth to be a college ambassador.

Wiseman Dean(s): Margaret J. McLaughlin Assistant Dean(s): Kathleen A. Angeletti The College of Education is a professional college committed to preparing accomplished beginning and advanced-level professionals who can advance the learning and development of their students and who are ready to become leaders in their fields. The College seeks to foster the learning and development of PK-16 students through our educator preparation programs, leadership, research, advocacy, and partnerships. Educational inequities exist on multiple levels; therefore, we aim to prepare educators with the skills and commitments necessary to ensure equity for all students in the 6. The Colleges and Schools Page 165prepare educators with the skills and commitments necessary to ensure equity for all students in the public schools and classrooms they will lead. The college programs prepare educators, counselors, psychologists, administrators, researchers, and educational specialists. Graduates work with individuals from infancy through adulthood in schools, community agencies, colleges and universities. Educational programs are accredited/approved by the following: Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP)/National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE), American Psychological Association, Council on Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Professions, and Council on Rehabilitation Education. Accreditation provides reciprocal certification with most other states that recognize national accreditation. MSDE issues certificates to teach in the public schools of the state. In addition to graduation from an approved program, MSDE requires satisfactory scores on the state Praxis licensure exams for certification. At the time of graduation, the College informs MSDE of the graduates' eligibility for certification. Under Maryland law, criminal background checks may be required and considered by MSDE in the awarding of teaching certification, and by employers before granting employment in the teaching field. Certification may be denied or revoked for individuals who have been convicted of crimes of violence and/or crimes against children. Additionally, some Maryland counties require a criminal background check prior to placement in an internship. Special Advantages and Facilities Students in the College of Education have the opportunity to work with an exemplary faculty. Among our ranks are nationally known faculty researchers who have made significant contributions to advancing theory and improving professional practice. In addition, the College's strategic location provides students with research opportunities that are unparalleled. Teacher candidates can complete their teaching internship and conduct research in school districts with highly diverse populations. The region also provides access to several research libraries, government agencies, not-for-profit organizations, and educational associations. The College of Education offers many special resources and facilities to students, faculty, and the community, including the following centers: The Center for Mathematics Education provides a mathematics laboratory for undergraduate and graduate students. Occasionally there are tutoring services for children and adolescents. These services are offered in conjunction with special graduate and undergraduate courses in elementary and secondary school mathematics. Center faculty are engaged in research in mathematics education, serve as consultants to school systems and instructional publishers, and provide in-service teacher education in addition to graduate degree programs. The Center for Young Children is part of the Institute for Child Study/Human Development in the College of Education. It offers a creative learning experience for children three, four, and five years old whose parents are affiliated with the University. The Center engages in child study, curriculum development, and teacher preparation. Its research and observation facilities are available to parents, faculty, and other persons concerned with the care and education of young children. Admission Requirements Admission to Teacher Education Professional Course Work Applicants to the University of Maryland who have declared an interest in education are admitted to a department in the College. All majors must meet the selective admission requirements for full 6. The Colleges and Schools Page 166a department in the College. All majors must meet the selective admission requirements for full admission into the College of Education in order to enroll in the professional sequence of the teacher education degree programs. The admission process includes three steps: Pre-Admission Review: Candidates must (1) complete the English and math lower-level fundamental studies (six credits) with a grade of C- or better; (2) earn 45 semester hours with an overall cumulative grade point average of at least 2.75 on a 4.0 scale; (3) complete gateway and/or specialization or major requirements for the program area with a minimum 2.70 GPA, and earn at least a B in any Education course identified by the program as a specific gateway prerequisite; (4) submit a personal goal statement that indicates an appropriate commitment to professional education; (5) have prior experiences in the education field; (6) submit three letters of recommendation/reference; (7) receive satisfactory ratings on the College of Education Technical Standards/Foundational Competencies (or submit a signed copy of the College of Education Foundational Competencies/Technical Standards Self Assessment if formal evaluations have not yet occurred); (8) submit criminal history disclosure statement; and, (9) have passing scores on the Praxis I. 1. Program Faculty review the applications of the candidates who meet the above criteria and rate them on six components: (1) overall GPA, (2) GPA in gateway/specialization/major, (3) rating for prior experience, (4) rating of recommendations, (5) rating of application essay, and (6) review of Foundational Competencies evaluation/self-report.2. The faculty sets a minimum cut score for eligibility based upon several factors (e.g., instructional resource capacity of the program/department, Professional Development School [PDS] placement capacity in the certification area, availability of high quality mentors in the certification area, work force need in the state, etc.). Candidates meeting at least minimum cut scores are scheduled for interviews. Program faculty re-ranks candidates based on aggregate scores from the complete profile - i.e., the six factors in step 2 plus the interview. The highest ranking individuals using the aggregate score are offered admission. [The total number admitted is based on target enrollment guidelines.]3. Admission application forms are available in Room 1204 of the Benjamin Building. Only those who are admitted are able to enroll in the professional education sequence. An overall grade point average of 2.75 must be maintained after admission to Teacher Education to continue in the professional education programs. The program faculty is able to recommend selected other candidates for Discretionary Admission based on any of a variety of special considerations. Consult the Student Services Office (Room 1204 Benjamin Bldg.) for policies and procedures regarding Discretionary Admission. Criteria for admission to the Teacher Education program apply to any teacher preparation program offered by the University of Maryland. Thus, undergraduates desiring a major in music or physical education should apply to the College of Education for admission to the professional program in Teacher Education. Individuals who are not enrolled in the College of Education but who, through an established cooperative program with another college are preparing to teach, must meet all admission, scholastic and curricular requirements of the College of Education. The courses in the professional education sequence are restricted to teacher candidates who are enrolled in an approved teacher preparation program and degree-seeking majors who have met College of Education requirements for admission and retention. Gateway Requirements for Early Childhood and Elementary Education Programs In order to meet the Maryland State Department of Education's (MSDE's) institutional performance criteria for the Redesign (i.e. strong math and science background for early 6. The Colleges and Schools Page 167performance criteria for the Redesign (i.e. strong math and science background for early childhood and elementary education teacher candidates), prospective majors in these programs need to fulfill additional performance criteria. In addition to the requirements for admission to teacher education that are listed above, early childhood and elementary education majors must satisfy the following gateway requirements: 1. Completion of a four-credit general education laboratory physical science, a four-credit general education laboratory biological science, Elements of Numbers and Operations (MATH 212), and Elements of Geometry and Measurement (MATH 213) with a minimum grade of C- in each class and a 2.7 cumulative GPA across all four courses. 2.Completion of Looking Inside Schools and Classrooms (EDCI 280) or Exploring Teaching in Early Childhood (EDHD220) with a grade of B- or better 3. Passing scores on the Praxis I: Academic Skills Assessments (Applicants will be required to meet the individual cut-off scores for each of the three Praxis I assessments. A composite score will not be accepted for admission.) In keeping with the campus undergraduate admissions policy, the College of Education will admit as many freshmen as possible as \"pre-service\" education majors. Internal and external transfers who have completed fewer than 60 credits and who have not yet met the standards required for enrollment in the professional degree programs also will be admitted as \"pre-service\" education majors. For directly admitted freshmen, the above admission requirements will serve as the criteria for the sophomore (early childhood, elementary, and special education) or junior (secondary education) level review. For internal and external transfers, these criteria make up the \"gateway.\" Teacher candidates who pass the sophomore/junior level review or the gateway will be admitted into the professional degree programs. Transfers with sixty or more credits will be granted permission to enroll as a pre-service major in education, provided they have maintained at least a 2.75 GPA and successfully completed the lower-level fundamental studies with a minimum grade of C- or better. These individuals will be given one semester to meet the requirements for admission to teacher education. Detailed information regarding admission to the Teacher Education program, including the gateway requirements for Early Childhood or Elementary Education, is available in the Student Services Office, Room 1204 Benjamin (301-405-2344). Undergraduate Degree Requirements/Degree Options The College of Education confers the degrees of Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) or Bachelor of Science (B.S.) depending on the amount of liberal arts study included in a particular degree program. Minimum requirements for graduation are 120 semester hours. Specific departmental program requirements for more than the minimum must be fulfilled. In addition to the university's general education requirements and the specific requirements for each curriculum, the College requires that all majors complete a Foundations of Education course (e.g., EDPS 301) and, depending upon the teacher education major, six to twelve semester hours of reading course requirements. A grade of C- or better is required in all pre-professional and 6. The Colleges and Schools Page 168professional course work required for the major. An overall grade point average of 2.75 must be maintained after admission to Teacher Education. A grade of S is required in the teaching internship. All teacher candidates are required to obtain satisfactory evaluations on the College of Education Foundational Competencies/ Technical Standards and attain qualifying scores for the State of Maryland on the Praxis I and Praxis II assessments. Detailed information about the Praxis assessments is available in the Student Services Office, Room 1204 Benjamin. Exceptions to curricular requirements and rules of the College of Education must be recommended by the teacher candidate's advisor and department chairperson and approved by the Dean. Yearlong Internship The yearlong internship, which is the culminating experience in the teacher preparation program, takes place in a collaborating school (i.e., partner school, PDS -- Professional Development School ). Each teacher candidate's internship will vary according to the unique attributes of their teacher education program. All internships will provide teacher candidates with the opportunity to integrate theory and practice through a comprehensive, reality-based experience. The yearlong internship is arranged through the College of Education in collaboration with the school site coordinators, PDS Coordinators, and the designated schools in the partnership. The yearlong internship is a full-time commitment. Interference with this responsibility because of employment or course work is strongly discouraged. Teacher candidates assigned to schools for this internship are responsible for their own transportation and living arrangements and should be prepared to travel to whichever school has been assigned. The final semester of the yearlong internship requires a special fee. Please consult the course listings within Testudo for the current lab fee. During the teaching internship, teacher candidates should be prepared to adhere to the academic schedule/calendar for the school system in which they are placed. In order to receive a yearlong internship placement, all teacher candidates must make application the semester prior to the internship year. Prospective interns must have been admitted to Teacher Education and have completed all prerequisites. Prior to assignment, all candidates in teacher preparation programs must have: (1) maintained a minimum overall grade point average of at least 2.75 with a minimum grade of \"C-\" in every course required for the major; (2) satisfactorily completed all other required course work in their program; (3) received a favorable recommendation from their department; (4) attained qualifying scores for the State of Maryland on the Praxis I and Praxis II assessments; (5) applied for a year-long internship placement through the College of Education during the semester prior to the internship year; (6) received favorable ratings from prior supervised experiences in school settings; (7) received favorable evaluations on the College of Education Foundational Competencies/Technical Standards; and (8) submitted a criminal history disclosure statement. In addition, state law gives the local school to which the intern is assigned the discretion to require a criminal background check prior to placement. Early Childhood Education majors must have a certificate indicating freedom from tuberculosis and proof of immunization. Note: All registrations in the teaching internship, regardless of whether an intern withdraws or takes a leave of absence, will be counted as an attempt under the campus repeat policy. Only two registrations will be allowed. After two registrations, further attempts at the teaching internship must be approved by the department and the school system professionals involved in the teacher candidate's internship experience. College of Education Foundational Competencies/Technical Standards All candidates in the UM professional preparation programs are expected to demonstrate that they are prepared to work with children and youth in educational settings. This preparation results from the combination of successful completion of university coursework and field/internship experiences 6. The Colleges and Schools Page 169and the demonstration of important human characteristics and dispositions that all educators should possess. These characteristics and dispositions, the College of Education Foundational Competencies/Technical Standards, are grouped into seven categories: English Language Competence, Interpersonal Competence, Work and Task Management, Analytic/Reasoning Competencies, Professional Conduct, Physical Abilities, and Professional Dispositions. Foundational Competencies/Technical Standards serve several important functions, including, but not limited to: (a) providing information to those considering pre K-12 and community professional careers that will help such individuals in their career decision-making; (b) advising applicants of non-academic criteria considered in admissions decisions made by the University's pre K-12 and community professional preparation programs; (c) serving as the basis for feedback provided to candidates in these programs regarding their progress toward mastery of all program objectives; and (d) serving as the basis for the final assessment of attainment of graduation requirements and recommendation for certification. Candidates in the undergraduate teacher preparation programs will be required to achieve satisfactory ratings on the College of Education Foundational Competencies/Technical Standards (or, if evaluations are not yet available, submit a College of Education Foundational Competencies/Technical Standards Acknowledgment Form) as part of the College's selective admissions review in the sophomore or junior year. Self-assessments of candidates and faculty evaluations on the Foundational Competencies/Technical Standards also will occur during each field/internship experience. Teacher candidates will be monitored and given feedback throughout the program. At specified points, they will be notified of inadequacies that may prevent them from progressing through their program. Documentation and consensus regarding the teacher candidate's functioning will be sought before any action is taken. Candidates who experience deficiencies in any areas will be encouraged to seek appropriate professional help from university or other sources. If the problem seems to be beyond remediation, admission and/or continuation in the professional programs, graduation, or recommendation for certification may be denied. Foundational Competencies/Technical standards may be met with, or without, accommodations. The University complies with the requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Therefore, the College of Education will endeavor to make reasonable accommodations with respect to these standards for an applicant with a disability who is otherwise qualified. For detailed information on the College of Education-Foundational Competencies/Technical Standards, see www.education.umd.edu/studentinfo/teachercert.html. LiveText Portfolio Requirement: The College recently instituted a new learning electronic portfolio and accreditation management system for its teacher preparation programs. An active subscription to LiveText is a requirement for the courses that comprise the professional education curriculum. Teacher candidates will be expected to submit a number of their course and portfolio assignments through LiveText. The LiveText account, which can be purchased at the University Book Center, is a one-time purchase that is comparable in price to the cost of a textbook. These accounts will last for a full year after graduation so that education majors can use their electronic LiveText portfolios in the job seeking process. For more information about LiveText, contact Dr. Kathy Angeletti, Assistant Dean (kangel@umd.edu). Advising The Student Services Office provides academic advising for education majors regarding admission, 6. The Colleges and Schools Page 170orientation, registration, graduation, and certification. At other times, teacher candidates who have been admitted to the College of Education receive academic advising through their program advisors. Advising is mandatory in the College of Education: Education majors must be advised prior to registration each semester. Teacher candidates should consult an advisor in their academic program for further information about the mandatory advising requirement. Teacher candidates are required to complete an academic audit in the Office of Student Services upon admission to the professional teacher education degree program. Undergraduates are expected to complete their degree program in a timely manner and to adhere to program benchmarks. Information about program benchmarks and four-year plans is available on the Student Services website at http://www.education.umd.edu/studentinfo/undergraduate_info/index.html . Departments and Centers The College includes a number of centers that offer special resources and facilities to students, faculty, and the community, including the following: Center for Children, Relationships and Culture Center for Education Policy and Leadership Center for Integrated Latent Variable Research (CILVR) Center for Literacy, Language, and Culture Center for Mathematics Education Center for Young Children Institute for the Study of Exceptional Children and Youth International Center for Transcultural Education Maryland Assessment Research Center for Education Success (MARCES) Maryland English Institute Maryland Institute for Minority Achievement and Urban Education P16 Partnership Development Center Science Teaching Center Researchers from the College of Education also will be studying the neural basis of language, emotion and thought in the new campus Brain Imaging Center. The centerpiece of this center will be a new functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI scanner. This new center will allow unique research to be conducted, including examining brain activity as children learn to read and understand word meanings, and discovering brain areas in children that are activated during social acceptance or rejection.

The Colleges and Schools Page 174A. JAMES CLARK SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING (ENGR) 3110 Jeong H. Engineering Dean(s): William Fourney, Peter Kofinas, Alison Flatau The Clark School, located in close proximity to many of the federal agencies and tech corporations that help shape the field of engineering, offers students exceptional opportunities to prepare for and launch rewarding careers and help make the world a better place. We combine rigorous classroom learning with initiatives that let students apply concepts through hands-on work, including the autonomous hovercraft project in freshman year and capstone courses in junior and senior years; numerous national and international engineering competitions in which the school is consistently successful; and extensive internship opportunities. We offer students the chance to engage in cutting-edge research, whether in the many labs run by prominent faculty members in state-of-the-art facilities, or with potential employers in nearby federal research labs and corporations. Research enables students to dig deeper into their majors or explore new areas of possible interest. Entrepreneurship is a key characteristic of Clark School students, and the school offers nationally recognized living-learning programs to help students understand and begin the process of tech company formation. The school maintains a strong program to link students with counterparts in the Smith School of Business. With one of the nation's most active chapters of Engineers Without Borders, Clark School students can apply their skills and energies in the service of less fortunate people all around the world. Service options closer to home are available through the many student societies, alternative spring breaks and targeted initiatives started by fellow students. It is this range of opportunities that makes the Clark School so valuable to talented, ambitious students who want a deeper university experience. We encourage you to explore further by visiting www.eng.umd.edu . Admission Requirements Direct Admissions Requirements Admission to the Clark School of Engineering is limited. Applicants are reviewed and will be admitted directly on a competitive basis. Evaluation is based on high school grades, standardized test scores, activities, leadership and demonstrations of potential to succeed. An applicant may apply to any of the majors offered within the School. An applicant also has the option of entering as an Undecided Engineering major and will typically choose a degree program in the first year. Academic Benchmarks Four Year Plan The Clark School of Engineering has expectations and policies designed to promote the success of its students and to ensure timely progress to the degree. A student, in consultation with their departmental advisors, is required to develop an individual plan for timely completion of his/her 6. The Colleges and Schools Page 175degree program. The plan will be reviewed by the student and his/her advisor on a regular basis and revised, if necessary, as individual circumstances change. Under normal circumstances, a student is expected to complete his/her degree requirements in no more than four years. Benchmarks Directly admitted freshmen will be subject to an academic review at the end of the semester in which they attain 45 University of Maryland credits.

Post-baccalaureate students must meet all transfer admission requirements. Engineering Transfer Programs Most of the community colleges in Maryland provide one- or two-year programs which have been coordinated to prepare students to enter the sophomore or junior year in engineering at the University of Maryland . These curricula are identified as Engineering Transfer Programs in the catalogs of the sponsoring institutions. The various associate degree programs in technology do not provide the preparation and transferability into the degree curricula as the designated transfer programs. A maximum of one-half of the degree credits (approximately 60 semester hours) may be transferred from a two-year community college program. There may be some courses which are not offered by the schools participating in the Engineering Transfer program. Students should investigate the feasibility of completing these courses in summer school at the University of Maryland before starting their junior course work in the fall semester. Undergraduate Degree Requirements/Degree Options Structure of Engineering Curricula: Courses in the normal curriculum or program and prescribed credit hours leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science (with curriculum designation) are outlined in the sections describing each department in the Clark School of Engineering. No student may modify the prescribed number of hours without special permission from the Dean of the School. The courses in each curriculum may be classified in the following categories: 1. Courses in the General Education Program, 2. Courses in the physical sciences, mathematics, chemistry, and physics. 3. Related technical courses, engineering sciences and other courses approved for one curriculum but offered by another department. 4. Courses in the major department. A student should obtain written approval for any substitution of courses from the department chair and the Dean of the School. The courses in each engineering curriculum, as classified below, form a sequential and developmental pattern in subject matter. In this respect, curricula in engineering may differ from curricula in other colleges. Some regulations which are generally applicable to all students may need clarification for purposes of orderly administration among engineering students (see the Academic Regulations in chapter 4). Moreover, the Clark School of Engineering establishes policies which supplement university regulations. School Regulations 1. The responsibility for proper registration and for satisfying stated prerequisites for any course must rest with the student as does the responsibility for proper achievement in courses in which the student is enrolled. Each student should be familiar with the provisions of this catalog, including the 6. The Colleges and Schools Page 177Academic Regulations. 2. Required courses in mathematics, physics, and chemistry have highest priority. It is strongly recommended that every engineering student register for mathematics and chemistry or mathematics and physics each semester until the student has fully satisfied requirements of the Clark School of Engineering in these subjects. 3. To be eligible for a bachelor's degree in the Clark School of Engineering, a student must have an overall cumulative grade point average of at least a 2.0, a C- or better in all engineering degree requirements including: to UM in the fall of 2012 or after must also have a 2.0 cumulative GPA in their major courses, minor courses or classes used to satisfy certificate programs. 4. In addition to the requirement for a C- or better in all engineering, CMSC, and degree requirements, all students who begin college-level work, either at the University of Maryland or any other institution in the Spring 2005 semester or later, must receive a grade of C- or higher in all technical courses (e.g. mathematics, physics, etc) used to satisfy major requirements. 5. A course taken at UM in which a grade has been earned may not be repeated via transfer from another institution. 6. Students in the Clark School of Engineering must have a minimum 2.0 University of Maryland GPA to enroll in courses at another institution. 7. All students are required to complete a number of general education courses and must follow the university's requirements regarding completion of the General Education Program. Consult the Academic Regulations section of this catalog for additional information. Engineering students who began college-level work (either at the University of Maryland or at other institutions) during the Fall 1989 semester or later are required to complete a junior-level technical writing course, ENGL393, regardless of their performance in freshman English classes. This represents a School policy, not a University-wide policy. 8. All degree programs in the Clark School of Engineering require a minimum of 120 credits plus satisfaction of all department, School, and University general education program requirements. Students should be aware that for all currently existing engineering programs the total number of credits necessary for the degree exceeds 120 by some number that depends on the specific major. Curricula for the various engineering departments are given in this catalog to illustrate how the programs can be completed in four years. These curricula are rigorous and relatively difficult. Surveys have shown that only about one-third to one-half of the students actually receive an engineering degree in four years. The majority of students (whether at Maryland or at other engineering schools nationwide) complete the engineering program in four and one-half to five years. It is quite feasible for a student to stretch out any curriculum; this may be necessary or desirable for a variety of reasons. However, students should seek competent advising in order to ensure that courses are taken in the proper sequence. All students are urged to complete a senior audit using Degree Navigator and review with their departmental advisor at least two semesters prior to graduation. The purpose of the senior audit is to discuss academic progress and confirm that graduation requirements are being completed. Departments and Degrees The Clark School of Engineering consists of eight academic departments and offers the degree of 6. The Colleges and Schools Page 178Bachelor of Science in the following fields of study: Aerospace Engineering, Bioengineering, Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Fire Protection Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. All of the above programs are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org , 111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, MD 21202-4012, telephone: (410) 347-7700. Freshman-Sophomore Years The freshman and sophomore years in engineering are designed to lay a strong foundation in mathematics, physical sciences, and the engineering sciences upon which the student will later develop a professional program during the upper division (junior and senior) years. During the first two years, students are introduced to the concepts of engineering design and work in multidisciplinary teams. The School course requirements for the freshman and sophomore years are similar for all students, regardless of their intended academic program, thus affording the student maximum flexibility in choosing a specific engineering specialization. Engineering Sciences Engineering Science courses represent a common core of basic material offered to students of several different departments. All freshman and sophomore students of engineering are required to take ENES 100. Other ENES courses, 102, 220, 221, and 232 are specified by the different departments or taken by the student as electives. The responsibility for teaching the engineering science courses is divided among the engineering departments. In addition to the core courses noted above, several courses of general interest to engineering or non-engineering students have been given ENES designations. See the List of Approved Courses in chapter 8 for further descriptions of these courses. Freshman Curriculum See individual department requirements in the Departments and Majors section of this site. Entering freshman math placement is determined solely by performance on the University math placement exam and not on the Math SAT score. Placement in MATH 115 or lower will delay by a semester eligibility to take certain engineering courses. Sophomore Year No later than the sophomore year, a student should select an academic degree program (Aerospace, Bioengineering, Chemical, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Fire Protection, Mechanical, or Materials Science and Engineering) and this department assumes the responsibility for the student's academic guidance, counseling, and program planning from that point until the completion of the degree requirements of that program as well as the School. For the specific requirements, see the curriculum listing in each engineering department. Advising Advising is mandatory for all students in the Clark School . Advising for freshmen and undecided engineering students is provided by the Office of Undergraduate Advising and Academic Support, located in Room 1131 Glenn L. Martin Hall, 301-405-9973, and is available by appointment Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Walk-in advising is also available at specific 6.

Individual Studies Program 2407 Marie Mount Hall, 301-314-0023 www.ivsp.umd.edu individualstudies@umd.edu Director: Dr. Joan Burton The Individual Studies Program (IVSP) is a degree-granting academic program administered 6. The Colleges and Schools Page 227through the Office of Undergraduate Studies. The program enables students to design their own interdisciplinary majors leading to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree. Students draw primarily from the University of Maryland 's course offerings to form an academic concentration not otherwise available to them at the institution. A written proposal that defines the student's major and outlines the curriculum is required to apply to the program. Individually created student majors have recently included such titles as International Relations and Diplomacy, Peace Building and Social Change, Global Health, 3D Environment Modeling and Design, Environmental Sustainability, Education and Social Change in Latin America, Healthcare Management for Diverse Communities, Global Development, Middle Eastern Studies, Asian American Policy and Advocacy, International Relations and East Asia, Women's Health and Global Communication, Renaissance Studies, and Urban Design and Studies. Students must seek the guidance and approval of a Faculty Mentor prior to having their proposal reviewed by the Individual Studies Faculty Review Board. If approved, the courses agreed upon by the Faculty Review Board become the basis for the student's major requirements. These listed requirements from numerous academic departments, along with the CORE general education requirements, are analogous in most ways to the academic requirements given to students who select from the University's traditional majors. However, each student is required to design a unique program of study and defend it in order to be a part of IVSP. Individual Studies students must complete a senior capstone project and are encouraged to engage in internships, research projects, independent studies, and study abroad to supplement their work in the classroom. Drawing from real-life experience as a supplement to the academic curriculum is generally encouraged. These projects often serve as a way for the students to develop academic connections among the multiple disciplines involved in their programs. While IVSP gives students the opportunity to create a unique academic program focused on a specific area of study, using courses from multiple academic departments, it does not substitute for or replicate the educational goals of existing University programs, including the Limited Enrollment Programs (LEPs). IVSP programs may not include substantial numbers of courses from LEP departments. Developing a successful IVSP proposal takes time and involves several meetings to review and edit the draft proposal. Interested students should contact the IVSP staff and begin the application process early in their academic career. Working closely with the IVSP staff and their prospective Faculty Mentor, students should plan to complete and submit their IVSP proposal, preferably during their sophomore year, or in their junior year, before reaching 90 credits. To be admitted into the Individual Studies Program, the student must: 1. Have a clearly defined academic goal that cannot be reasonably satisfied in an existing curriculum at the University of Maryland , College Park . 2. Have at least 30 earned college credits with at least 12 credits completed at College Park. 3. Have a minimum of a 2.5 GPA in each of their previous two semesters of college and at least a 2.0 GPA overall. 4. Complete at least 30 additional credits beginning the term following admission to IVSP. 5. Identify an appropriate faculty mentor, preferably tenured or tenure track, with significant undergraduate education experience related to the field of study. 6. Complete a detailed plan of study (proposal) that is approved by their Faculty Mentor and then approved by the Individual Studies Faculty Review Board. This proposal will include: a. A clear statement of the central academic purpose for their major. b. Specific course requirements including at least 27 credits of upper-division major coursework (300 and 400 level) beyond the IVSP courses (IVSP 317, IVSP 318, and 6. The Colleges and Schools Page 228coursework (300 and 400 level) beyond the IVSP courses (IVSP 317, IVSP 318, and IVSP 420). c. The list of courses must include at least one Writing Craft course (in addition to the CORE Fundamental Studies Academic Writing and the Professional Writing requirements) selected from an approved list that is available from the Individual Studies staff. d. A semester-by-semester plan for the completion of their undergraduate degree within a reasonable period of time. Following admission, students must: 1. Earn a grade of C- or better in all courses required in their IVSP program of study, including IVSP 420 as well as a satisfactory grade in IVSP 317. 2. Complete mandatory advising sessions with their Faculty Mentor and the IVSP staff every semester, including a review of their semester-by-semester academic plan for completion of their IVSP program. 3. If not already completed, work towards immediate completion of the Fundamental Studies requirements. For details and further information, visit the IVSP website at www.ivsp.umd.edu.

The basic educational requirements of the Maryland State Board of Public Accountancy to sit for the CPA examination are a baccalaureate or higher degree with a major in Accounting or with a non-accounting degree supplemented by course work the Board determines to be substantially the equivalent of an Accounting major. Students planning to take the CPA examination for certification and licensing outside Maryland should determine the educational requirements for that state and arrange their program accordingly. 120 credits are required to complete a degree in Accounting; however, students seeking to become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) must meet the certification requirements for the state in which they wish to practice. Most states, including Maryland, require a minimum of 150 credit hours of college education to fulfill the education requirements to obtain a CPA license. However many of these states, including Maryland, will allow applicants to take the CPA exam prior to earning 150 credits if they have accumulated 120 credits, earned a degree, and meet specified education requirements. In addition, do not assume the course and credit requirements for the accounting major are sufficient for all states. For details on various states' CPA requirments visit www.nasba.org . Advising General advising for students admitted to the Smith School of Business is available Monday through Friday in the Office of Undergraduate Programs, 1570 Van Munching Hall, 301-405-2286, undergradinfo@rhsmith.umd.edu.

Schmitz The Major Aerospace engineering concerns processes involved in design, manufacture and operation of aerospace vehicles within and beyond planetary atmospheres. Vehicles range from helicopters and other vertical takeoff aircraft at the low-speed end of the flight spectrum, to spacecraft traveling thousands of miles per hour during launch, orbit, trans-planetary flight or re-entry at the high-speed end. Between are general aviation and commercial transport aircraft flying at speeds well below and close to the speed of sound, and supersonic transports, fighters and missiles. Although each speed regime and each vehicle poses its special problems, all aerospace vehicles can be addressed by a common set of technical specialties or disciplines. Sub-disciplines of Aerospace Engineering are: aerodynamics, flight dynamics, propulsion, structures, and \"design\". Aerodynamics addresses the flow of air and associated forces, moments, pressures, and temperature changes. Flight-dynamics addresses the motion of vehicles including trajectories, rotational dynamics, sensors, and control laws required for successful accomplishment of missions. Propulsion addresses the engines which have been devised to convert chemical (and occasionally other forms) energy into useful work to produce the thrust needed to propel aerospace vehicles. Structures addresses material properties, stresses, strains, deflection, and vibration along with manufacturing processes required to produce very light weight and rugged elements needed in aerospace vehicles. Aerospace \"design\" addresses the process of synthesizing vehicles and systems to meet defined missions and more general needs. This process draws on information from other sub-disciplines while embodying its own unique elements. The Aerospace Engineering program is designed to provide a firm foundation in various sub-disciplines. Courses offered by this department may be found under the acronym: ENAE 7.

Gonzalez (Emerita), F. Jackson The Major Anthropology, the study of culture, seeks to understand humans as a whole - as social beings who are capable of symbolic communication through which they produce a rich cultural record. Anthropologists try to explain differences among cultures - differences in physical characteristics as well as in customary behavior. Anthropologists study how culture has changed through time as the human genus has spread over the earth. Anthropology is the science of the biological evolution of human species, and the disciplined scholarship of the cultural development of human beings' knowledge and customary behavior. Anthropology at the University of Maryland offers rigorous training for many career options. A strong background in anthropology is a definite asset in preparing for a variety of academic and professional fields, ranging from the law and business, to comparative literature, philosophy and the fine arts. Whether one goes on to a Master's or a Ph.D., the anthropology B.A. prepares one for a wide range of non-academic employment, such as city and public health planning, development consulting, program evaluation, and public archaeology. Courses offered by this department may be found under the acronym ANTH. Program Learning Outcomes Having completed the degree program, students should have acquired the following knowledge and skills: Students shall have an integrated knowledge, awareness and understanding of a culturally and biologically diverse world.1. Students shall demonstrate an understanding of culture and society.2. 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 256Students shall demonstrate the ability to understand complex research problems, and articulate appropriate methods and theory.3. Academic Programs and Departmental Facilities The Anthropology department offers beginning and advanced course work in the three principal subdivisions of the discipline: cultural anthropology, archaeology, and biological anthropology. Within each area, the department offers some degree of specialization and provides a variety of opportunities for research and independent study. Laboratory courses are offered in biological anthropology and archaeology. Field schools are offered in archaeology. The interrelationship of all branches of anthropology is emphasized. The Anthropology department has a total of five laboratories, located in Woods Hall, which are divided into teaching labs and research labs. The department's three archaeology labs, containing materials collected from field schools and research projects of the past several years, serve both teaching and research purposes. The other two laboratories are a teaching laboratory in biological anthropology and the Laboratory for Applied Ethnography and Community Action Research. Cultural Systems Analysis Group (CuSAG), a research and program development arm of the department is located in Woods Hall. The Center for Heritage Research Studies, located in the Department of Anthropology, focuses on research devoted to understanding the cultural characteristics of heritage and its uses. The undergraduate curriculum is tied to the department's Master in Applied Anthropology (M.A.A.) program; accordingly, preparation for non-academic employment upon graduation is a primary educational goal of the department's undergraduate course work and internship and research components. The department has also recently implemented a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) program. Students at the graduate level are asked to focus in one of three areas of faculty expertise: Health, Heritage, and Environment. Requirements for the Major Students seeking an undergraduate degree are required to complete at least 31 credits of anthropology coursework in addition to the supporting coursework sequence.

Students work toward competence in speaking, reading, writing, and listening. The Arabic Program offers extensive linguistic training in both literary Arabic ( fusHa ) and Arabic dialects (Egyptian and Levantine). Students will achieve cultural fluency by exploring diverse Arab societies and cultural zones and will learn to approach them from a global perspective. Many undergraduates will choose to double major or do a double degree in Arabic and another subject, including arts and humanities majors, business, computer science, and journalism. Requirements for the Major Prerequisites (12 credits) Students must take the prerequisite courses or satisfy these requirements by placement:* ARAB104 Elementary Modern Standard Arabic I-II (6 credits) ARAB105 Elementary Modern Standard Arabic III-IV (6 credits) Core Sequence: 24 credits ARAB204Intermediate Modern Standard ARAB210) *Modern Standard Arabic is the formal variety of Arabic used throughout the Arab world, particularly for reading and writing. Egyptian Colloquial Arabic and Levantine Colloquial Arabic are among the major spoken varieties in the Middle East. All Arabic language courses implement the integrated method where Modern Standard Arabic and colloquial Arabic are taught simultaneously, as two registers of the Arabic linguistic discourse. Upon completing four semesters of Arabic (104, 105, 204, 205), students may choose to take either the Egyptian dialect sequence (206, 207) or the Levantine dialect sequence (210, 211) to deepen their knowledge of the dialect and culture. Once credits have been received for a higher-level language focus course, a lower-level course in the same strand (written or spoken) may not be taken for credit. (ARAB204 may not be taken after ARAB205, for example. ARAB107 may not be taken after ARAB206, etc.) The Arabic language curriculum is designed for second language acquisition and targets non-native speakers. None of the Arabic language courses are open to fluent and native speakers of Arabic. Electives: a minimum of 18 credits A.

Schlesinger (Prof Emeritus) The Major The School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation offers a four-year pre-professional undergraduate program leading to the Bachelor of Science degree in architecture. Students graduating with the undergraduate major in architecture typically require two years to complete the curriculum leading to the professional degree in architecture (M.ARCH). Students receive rigorous and comprehensive instruction from a faculty whose members are active in professional practice or research. Many faculty members have distinguished themselves across the professional spectrum and represent different approaches to architectural design. Their individual areas of expertise include architectural design and theory, history, architectural archaeology, technology, urban design and planning, and historic preservation. Visiting critics, lecturers, and the Kea Distinguished Professor augment the faculty; together they provide students with the requisite exposure to contemporary realities of architectural design. The B.S. degree in architecture will qualify graduates to pursue a career in a number of fields, such as construction, real estate development, public administration, or historic preservation, or to continue in graduate work in professional fields such as architecture, urban planning, historic preservation, landscape architecture, or law. The program offers design studios and electives in drawing and visual representation leading some of our students to pursue advanced degrees in graphic design, interior design, fashion design, exhibition design and other creative fields. 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 261our students to pursue advanced degrees in graphic design, interior design, fashion design, exhibition design and other creative fields. For information see the School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation entry in Chapter 6. Program Objectives The School's mission is to educate Architects, Planners, Preservationists, Developers and the many allied stakeholders whose work and scholarship focuses on the quality of the built environment and promotes social justice, cultural value, resource conservation and economic opportunity. We take advantage of our unique location\u2014in a region that features the nation's capital and the post-industrial City of Baltimore, and links the Appalachian Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean while surrounding the Chesapeake Bay. Maryland's opportunities and challenges are found in its diverse communities, explosive growth and extensive historic resources. Our faculty, students and alumni collaboratively advance their vision and commitment through research, teaching, colloquia, writing, creative design, planning, policy formation and professional work. Our mission is historically rooted in our land grant mandate and enhanced by our regional and international activities. Academic Programs and Departmental Facilities Architecture Library Located on the second floor of the Architecture Building, the Architecture library has planning and architecture books and periodicals, as well as Urban Studies and Planning studio reports. There is also a slide collection available in the Elizabeth D. Alley Visual Resources Collection on the same floor. Librarians are available by appointment to assist with your research needs. Visual Resources Center The VRC consists of more than 400,000 slides and digital images documenting architecture and the urban scene from pre-historic times to the present. Related topics include urban design, historic preservation, real estate development, art, landscape architecture, as well as events around the School. Other visual materials include over 400 DVDs and videotapes, along with lantern slides and photographs. Images are acquired through site photography, scanning materials, commercial vendors, and donations from faculty and students. The school's faculty and students are encouraged to use the current slides as a starting point for research. We are happy to scan items that are not yet in the digital realm. Images and other materials may be used for presentations in school classes and for research. Fabrication Lab The FabLab at the School of Architecture Planning and Preservation emphasizes the notion of learning to design through the process of making. Our students learn to influence the form and meaning of the built environment by working directly with its material and physical nature. We stress the integration of digital and hand fabrication methods, and explore how traditional technology is affected and transformed by new materials and technique.

Lapinski The Major The department's goal is to provide its students with the technical and conceptual tools needed to make innovative contributions to a visual culture in which traditional boundaries between the visual arts, design, film, video, and architecture have become increasingly blurred. The accomplished faculty members bring their professional experiences to the teaching studios, providing a contemporary context for the development of skills and ideas. From a shared foundation emphasizing traditional fundamentals of art and design, students move into media concentrations that encourage interdisciplinary interaction, particularly with developing digital technologies. This flexible interaction between traditional and new media is central to the department's vision and the success of its mission.

Withers (Assoc Prof Emerita) The Major The faculty and students of the Department of Art History and Archaeology form a dynamic nucleus within a major research university. The program, leading to the B.A. degree in Art History, provides a diverse selection of courses in the art and archaeology of Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas. The goal of the department is to develop the student's critical understanding of art history and visual culture. The department has strong coverage in Western art from the classical period up to the present. In addition, by taking advantage of the unusual diversity of faculty interests, students can study in areas not traditionally offered in departments of art history and archaeology, such as the art of Africa, art of the African diaspora, art of Latin America, and Chinese and Japanese art. Studies in archaeology may be pursued in cooperation with other University departments. Courses offered by this department may be found under the following acronym: ARTH. Program Objectives The Department of Art History and Archaeology's B.A. program equips its majors with critical knowledge of art history and visual culture. The program promotes visual literacy in the history of art from around the world and from prehistoric times to the present. It cultivates strong research, written, and critical thinking skills; and develops students' abilities to synthesize cultural, historical, political, and social information as it bears upon the visual arts. Program Learning Outcomes Students are expected to fully engage with the curriculum and the opportunities presented for learning and research. Having completed the B.A. in Art History, students should have acquired the following abilities: 1. An ability to demonstrate knowledge of a large set of artistic monuments, objects, and performances in their cultural, historical, political, and/or social contexts. 2. An ability to communicate effectively about art in writing, applying complex forms of analysis in essay-length papers using clear and concise prose. 3. An ability to employ the appropriate technologies for conducting research in the history of art, including print sources and/or electronic information. 4. An ability to recognize and understand fundamental art historical methods including but not limited to connoisseurship, stylistic chronology, visual and technical analysis, historical contextualization, and theoretical evaluation. 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 266Academic Programs and Departmental Facilities The location of the university between Washington and Baltimore gives students the opportunity to use some of the finest museum and archival collections in the world for their course work and independent research. The department encourages students to hold internships at a number of these institutions. Curator/professors, exhibitions in galleries at the University of Maryland, interactive technologies, and the extensive use of study collections complement traditional classroom learning. The department is in the forefront of exploring digital imaging technologies for art historical and archaeological teaching, research, and publication. The Michelle Smith Collaboratory for Visual Culture, located in the department on the fourth floor of the Art/Sociology Building, is central in creating a nurturing environment for academic research and creative learning. This new space permits ample workspace for meetings, workshops, forums, and the execution of large-scale technical projects.

Courses offered by this department may be found under the following acronyms: AOSC Program Objectives The Atmospheric and Oceanic Science B.S. program seeks to educate majors in the basic principles that control our weather and the interactions between atmosphere and ocean that regulate Earth's climate. Students will be provided with practical experience as researchers and creators of knowledge, and equipped with the requirements for a full range of careers in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science, as well as for related areas in secondary education, graduate school, industry, and public service. Academic Programs and Departmental Facilities Our department hosts an undergraduate major, three undergraduate minors, a professional masters and a full academic graduate program. The overlap between the professional masters program and the undergraduate program allows incoming freshman to earn both a bachelors and a masters degree in five years. We believe that research is an essential part of an undergraduate experience, and require all our majors to complete a senior thesis as part of their education! We maintain computer labs for the use of our students in addition to the computer facilities provided by the university, with all major operating systems represented. Several of our research groups also have their own compute clusters, and those who need to access still more powerful computing resources can use NASA, NOAA and NCAR machines. The department hosts several large disk arrays for local data storage and general-use compute clusters for student use in classes and on small projects. All are accessible from our laboratories. 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 270We have a state of the art rooftop meteorological laboratory, which currently houses standard meteorological instruments and more than a dozen atmospheric chemistry measurements. This facility also frequently hosts instruments from nearby research laboratories such as NASA and NOAA. A short distance away, our department runs an atmospheric chemistry, precipitation and deposition field site at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. Closely affiliated departments and programs, the Earth System Science Interdisciplinary Center (ESSIC) and the Joint Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI) are in the MSquare development immediately east of the main campus, and numerous world-class federal facilities are a short walk or drive away. The new NOAA Center for Weather and Climate Prediction with 700 NOAA researchers is housed next to ESSIC and JGCRI in the MSquare development just east of US Route 1. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center is five miles down the road, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, Naval Research Labs, Environmental Protection Agency, and many more are also located in the Washington, D.C. Metro area. All have hired our graduates and host frequent collaborations with our faculty and students.

Advising The Fischell Department of Bioengineering is committed to student advising and aims to provide comprehensive curricular support to all of its students towards their academic success. Students will find that at various points during their academic careers, they may need a certain kind of guidance. Students may always begin by addressing their questions to bioe-undergrad@umd.edu , and we will point you in the right direction. Generally, advising is handled by one or a combination of the following: faculty advisor, departmental advisor, and/or college advisor. Faculty Advising All bioengineering majors are assigned to a faculty advisor. Students are required to meet with their faculty advisors at least once per semester. For currently enrolled majors, the mandatory advising period occurs in the weeks prior to registration for the next semester. The advising meeting with the faculty member generally covers the following: course selection for upcoming semester, four-year planning, and career goals. Students should prepare for every advising meeting by completing and updating the BIOE Advising Worksheet. Freshmen will be assigned to faculty advisors and notified during their first semesters. All other students may contact bioe-undergrad@umd.edu if they are not sure who their advisor is. For faculty contact information, please see the faculty list . Departmental Advising Bioengineering majors and prospective transfer students may also need to meet with a departmental (staff) advisor. Some examples of departmental advising include: Benchmarks (academic progress), planning for study abroad, C.A.R.E (academic probation), double-major/double-degree planning, graduation audit (seniors), and additional help with four-year planning. For departmental advising, please send an email including your name, UID, and general question to bioe-undergrad@umd.edu All students seeking advising should read and make sure that they understand the policies and requirements stated in the BIOE Undergraduate Handbook (PDF). College Advising The Clark School of Engineering's Office of Undergraduate Advising and Academic Support (UA&AS) also provides a broad range of services and support for engineering students. Some policies are the oversight of the College, so your faculty or departmental advisor may at times refer you to a Clark School advisor. For example, transfer admission/transfer credit, 45-credit benchmark review, and permission to enroll at another institution are handled by the College.

Science, Technology and Society Certificate 1125 Cumberland Hall, 301-405-0527 www.sts.umd.edu Director, Dr. Betsy Mendelsohn - bmendel@umd.edu The undergraduate University Certificate program in Science, Technology, and Society (STS) enables students to learn about the dynamic, interactive and creative relationships among science, technology, and society. In addition to coursework, the STS program requires students to attend monthly, STS-related events on campus, which are listed on the program website. Students are invited to participate in field trips to research labs and in service activities related to STS; these activities build community among students, staff and faculty. Each student works closely with a faculty mentor when writing the capstone term paper in the senior ENES 440 seminar. The STS University Certificate is especially helpful to students who wish to impose a unifying theme on their elective courses. Courses relevant to the STS program are drawn from many departments; this demonstrates the currency of science and technology studies across 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 286disciplines in the sciences, engineering, the humanities, and social sciences. STS is an interdisciplinary field that has been taught for more than 30 years at universities in the United States and Europe, notably in those with strong engineering and public policy programs. In recent years, STS University Certificate students have chosen to write their capstone term papers about timely topics, including the interactions among science, technology and society related to nanotechnology, fuel cell applications, physics research funding, climate change modeling, religious principles as a basis for climate action, integration of SONAR into underwater vehicles, nuclear power in developing countries, and interpersonal impacts of social networking. Courses: The STS program requires 9 credits of Lower Level and 12 credits of Upper Level courses. Students must obtain prior approval of the director before counting courses toward their individualized STS curriculum. Many of these credits may overlap with major and minor requirements. For guidance, see the website for a list of approved courses, and note that students may ask the director to approve a course not listed on the website. Lower Level (100- and 200-level) Courses (9 credits): Two courses that relate science to society, technology to society, or science to technology; one should be a survey course with broad temporal or subject content The STS sophomore survey course, CPSP227 Upper Level (300- and 400-level) Courses (12 credits): These courses have an interdisciplinary orientation that demonstrates inter-relationships between science and society, between technology and society, or between science and technology. Students choose three courses and the fourth course is ENES440, the STS University Certificate capstone. Joining the Program and Program Requirements: Students interested in STS should contact the director to obtain advice and approval prior to enrolling in courses that fulfill the program. Students record their progress with the STS program office as they complete requirements, participate in a semi-annual advising meeting, and write a brief evaluation upon completing the program. Students must earn a minimum grade of C- in each course they wish to credit toward the STS University Certificate. A student's individual course of study may not exceed these maximums: 9 credits of courses applied to the student's major; 3 credits of Special or Selected Topics courses; 9 credits of courses taken outside UMCP; and 6 credits of courses with the AREC, ECON and GVPT prefixes. Once all requirements are met and the director affirms that the student has completed the program, the Registrar includes a notation of this University Certificate on the student's transcript.

Parara (Visit Asst Prof) The Major Courses offered by this department may be found under the following acronym(s): CLAS, LATN, GREK. Classics is the study of ancient Greek and Roman culture in all its aspects. Greek and Roman culture provided the foundation of western culture, including its literature, ideas, art, politics, and conceptions of the individual. Greek myth is still a shared fund of images and narratives that expresses human experience. Latin is the major source of English vocabulary, and Greek provides technical language in many fields. Classics explores all of these aspects through over fifteen hundred years of history. It helps us understand the relationship of western culture to other cultural systems and place ourselves better in the world. Classics is an intellectually rich and versatile liberal arts major which teaches \"core skills\", including effective communication, critical thinking, and an appreciation of diversity. Because it is interdisciplinary and holistic, a student of classics gets a three-dimensional view of cultures and literatures that are still major forces today. Studying Athenian democracy and the Roman Republic sharpens understanding of competing philosophical and political ideas. Studying Latin not only develops English vocabulary but makes English grammar comprehensible. Both languages provide excellent analytic training; for instance, classics students score among the top in the analytic section of the GRE exams. Classics is a pre-professional major for law school or for graduate school in any aspect of the ancient world. Classics majors have also gone on to library school. Latin teachers are in demand; numerous students have found rewarding jobs teaching secondary school, with continued involvement in the classics community. Others have gone into business, worked in educational television, and gotten jobs in the writing or editing fields, in archival work, in special education, or in social services. Program Objectives Classics provides students with a liberal arts education: skills in written and oral use of language, close reading, critical thinking, and the appreciation of art, literature, and culture. The core subject matter of Classics consists of the Greek and Latin languages, the texts originally written in these languages, and the art and material culture of the peoples who spoke them. The program also studies the reception of these works in modern times and their relevance to us today. Program Learning Outcomes 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 301Program Learning Outcomes Having completed the degree program, students should have acquired the following knowledge and skills: Students must demonstrate the ability to interpret the cultural context of primary sources through a variety of methodological approaches.1. Majors who take Latin and Greek are expected to demonstrate some level of language proficiency.2. Latin majors must be able to read and translate Latin at the advanced level. Latin and Greek majors must be able to read and translate either Latin or Greek at the advanced level and the other language at the intermediate level. Classical Humanities majors must be able to demonstrate the ability to assess Classical texts in translation or primary evidence through a variety of methodological approaches at the advanced level. Academic Programs and Departmental Facilities The Classics Department has its own Classics library as well as a Classics Club for its undergraduate majors. Admission to the Major Admission to the major simply requires a meeting with the undergraduate advisor. No prior knowledge of Latin or Greek is required. Placement in Courses Students with a score of 4 or 5 in the AP Latin test receive credit for Latin 201 (4 credits) and may not take LATN 201 or lower for credit. For further information, contact the department's undergraduate advisor. Requirements for the Major Requirements for the Classics major include the College of Arts and Humanities requirement of 45 upper-level credits completed. The College's Global Engagement Requirement will be automatically fulfilled in the process of taking language courses in the Latin, Greek, and Latin and Greek tracks of the major. Students in the Classical Humanities track who elect to study Latin or Greek to the intermediate level (LATN 201 or GREK 201) will also satisfy the Global Engagement Requirement. No course grade below the grade of C- may count toward the major. An overall GPA of 2.0 in the major is required for graduation. Credits Option A: Latin LATN Courses at the 200/300 level 18 LATN Courses at the 400 level or higher 12 Supporting courses 9-12 Any level CLAS, GREK, or related fields such as HIST and ARTH Option B: Greek GREK Courses at the 200/300 level 18 GREK Courses at the 400 level or higher 12 Supporting courses 9-12 Any level CLAS, LATN, or related fields such as HIST and ARTH Option C: Latin and Greek LATN Latin courses 18 GREK Greek courses* 12 OR 7.

Stewart (Distinguished University Professor Emeritus), M. Zelkowitz The Major Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems: their application, design, development and theory. Principal areas within computer science include artificial intelligence, computer systems, database systems, human factors, numerical analysis, programming languages, software engineering, and theories of computing. A computer scientist is concerned with problem solving. Problems range from abstract questions of what problems can be solved with computers to practical matters such design of computer systems which are easy for people to use. Computer scientists build computational models of systems including physical phenomena (weather forecasting), human behavior (expert systems, robotics), and computer systems themselves (performance evaluation). Such models often require extensive numeric or symbolic computation. Placement in Courses Much of the knowledge at the early stage of the degree program is cumulative.

Wonnacott The Major Economists study a wide range of phenomena using analytical methods which describe how people and collections of people behave and interact. Many economists define their profession as the analysis of decisions made in the context of scarcity. Economics can also be described as the study of the production, pricing, and distribution of goods and services within societies. Economists study such issues as inflation, unemployment, poverty, environmental quality, financial markets, and international trade. Economists also apply their methods of analysis to such diverse areas as crime, health care, discrimination, and the problems of developing countries. Courses offered by this department may be found under the following acronym: ECON. As a large, diverse department, courses are offered in all of the major fields of economic study. Many courses analyze the role of the government and public policies impacting economic outcomes, while others focus on developing advanced applications of economic theories and methodologies. The program is designed to serve both majors and non-majors. The department offers a variety of 300-level courses on particular economic issues which can be taken after two semesters of principles. The program for majors is designed to serve those who will seek employment immediately after college as well as those who will pursue graduate study. Economics majors have a wide variety of career options, including positions in state and local government, federal and international agencies, business, finance and banking, journalism, teaching, politics and law. Many economics majors pursue graduate work in economics or another social science, law, business or public policy. Program Learning Outcomes Students are expected to fully utilize the opportunities presented for learning and research. Having completed the degree program, students should have acquired the following knowledge and skills: 1. Understanding of the key terminology used within the discipline. 2. Ability to use the fundamental methods and tools of the discipline to model economic behavior and to describe and analyze relationships between economic variables. 3. Ability to interpret and apply descriptive and inferential statistics. 4. Ability to analyze the effect of government policies on the economy using both conceptual and quantitative tools. Requirements for the Major In addition to the university's general education requirements, students must earn a minimum of 38 credits via a combination of foundation and elective courses in Economics and Math as listed below. Economics majors must also complete a minimum of 15 credits in supporting courses. All courses must be passed with a grade of C- or better to count towards the foundation, elective, and supporting requirements. Students must have a minimum 2.0 cumulative grade point average across all courses used to satisfy major degree requirements. A course used to fulfill one requirement for the major may not count towards any other economics major requirement. Students should see a departmental advisor for guidance on choosing between various options, especially if future plans include graduate training in economics.

Students will be notified as other appropriate courses are approved that fulfill the requirements for the major. Supporting Courses: Support - UL Upper level courses - see NOTES below 15 NOTES: Excludes Professional Writing class, internships, experiential learning other than ECON386, and 'non-traditional' courses. Additional mathematics courses beyond the required mathematics course (MATH 220 or 140) except MATH274 (History of Mathematics) may be counted as fulfilling the support course requirement. Additional economics courses may be included among the 15 hours of supporting courses. All supporting courses must be approved by an Economics Department Advisor. All courses meeting the supporting course requirement must be completed with a grade of C- or better and may not be taken pass-fail, except ECON386 which can only be taken pass-fail. Other Requirements for the Major Study Sequences and Plans of Study Economics is an analytical discipline, building on a core of principles, modeling methodologies, and statistical techniques. Students must begin with a foundation in mathematics and economic principles (ECON200 and ECON201). A more advanced, analytic treatment is presented in intermediate theory courses (ECON325 and ECON326), which provide necessary background for in-depth study of any specific issues, such as those covered in the upper level courses. Empirical research and the use of computers are becoming increasingly important in economics. All students are well advised to include as many statistics, econometrics, and quantitative methods courses in their curriculum as possible. Students interested in economics as preparation for a career in business, law, or policy-making and analysis, should visit the department's website for suggestions on specific upper-level courses to satisfy the elective requirements for the major. Those students planning to pursue graduate study in economics must begin to prepare themselves analytically for graduate work by focusing on theory, statistics, and mathematics in their undergraduate curriculum. These students should consider the full econometrics sequence of ECON422 and 423. Mastery of advanced calculus and linear algebra is essential for entrance into graduate schools, and therefore students must take MATH140, MATH141, MATH240, MATH241 and MATH246. Students should also plan on taking MATH410 and 411. Benchmarks: Students declaring Economics as their major must meet satisfactory progress benchmarks for the major. Economics majors must complete ECON200, ECON201, MATH220 or 140, and ECON300 with a grade of C- or higher within 2 semesters of entering the major. The College also requires the completion of four general education Distributive Studies courses (which can include ECON200, ECON201, and Calculus), as well as the English Fundamental Studies requirement. In addition to the benchmark courses included above, students must complete ECON326 and ECON321 with a grade of C- or higher within three semesters of entering the major. These benchmark deadlines may not be appropriate for all incoming freshmen (depending upon credit earned prior to college entrance and math placement).

Winton The Major The English major has four parts: English 301, Group I Requirements, Group II Requirements, and Emphasis/Elective Requirements. English 301 is a required course and should usually be taken in the first semester after a student becomes an English major. Group I Requirements provide a broad foundation in literary history and an awareness of questions an inquiring reader might ask of a text. Group II Requirements explore in greater depth both literary periods and literary themes across periods, and develop skills in reading, criticism, writing, and research. The Emphasis/Electives Requirements allows students to focus on their personal interests within the major. The major requires 36 credits beyond the University's Fundamental Studies requirement. At least 30 of the 36 credits must be at the 300- or 400-level; at least 12 credits must be 400-level. A \"C-\" or better is required in each course making up the 36 credits of the major. An overall GPA of 2.0 in the major is required for graduation. Three credits of ENGL388 (Internship) may be included in the 36 credits of the major. Only 6 credits of ENGL429 (Independent Study) may be included in the 36 credits of the major. Only 9 credits of ENGL379 (Special Topics) may be included in the 36 credits of the major. Only 9 credits of ENGL428 (Seminars) may be included in the 36 credits of the major. Program Objectives The English major has been designed to give students an overview of the history and variety of literature written in English; to use the critical study of language and literature to help students think carefully and express themselves well; and to introduce students to the debates about literature and culture that shape our intellectual lives and our national and global conversations. Our hope is that our graduates will enter the world with the sophistication, critical acumen, and sympathy born of wide reading and with the skills needed to carry their convictions into action, no matter what line of work they pursue. Program Learning Outcomes Students will be able to analyze texts critically. Students will be able to write persuasively. Students will be able to conduct research in English studies. Students will gain an appreciation for the importance of writing, past and present, in society; for the complexity of literature; and for the variety of perspectives that written expressions represent. Requirements for the Major The English major requires 36 credits distributed as follows: Credits ENGL301: Critical Methods in the Study of Literature 3 English majors must take ENGL 301 before they take other 300- or 400-level English courses.

Cory Undergraduate Scholarship. Environmental Science and Policy 301-405-8571 (Associate Director) Lecturers: J. Goger (Lecturer), J. Murrow (Lecturer) The Major Environmental Science and Policy is a broadly multi-disciplinary, undergraduate major, drawing courses and faculty from 20 departments and three Colleges (the Colleges of Agriculture and Natural Resources; Behavioral and Social Sciences; Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences). New ENSP students begin in the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, where they will be guided through a structured, exploratory advising process. ENSP students are expected to declare a concentration by the end of their third semester in the program and, once they declare their concentration, will move administratively to the College and department sponsoring the concentration. There, they are advised by a faculty member in their discipline. The ENSP faculty and staff aspire to provide a strong identity for the students enrolled in this major, and we encourage students to take advantage of the resources available at a Research I Public University. Experiential learning through internships and study abroad is strongly encouraged. Program Objectives The curriculum of Environmental Science and Policy comprises a core of courses at the introductory level in environmental science, environmental policy, biology, chemistry, earth sciences, geography, economics, calculus, statistics, and government and politics. This is followed by in-depth and focused training in one of twelve areas of concentration in biological resources, earth systems, or the human dimensions of the field. The educational philosophy of the program is to train students broadly using a multi-disciplinary approach at the introductory level so that they are exposed to the myriad ways there are to learn about environmental systems and to address human-environment issues. This introductory approach precedes the concentration in which the students are prepared for post-graduate study or work in a discipline-based field. The combination of the lower-level core courses and upper-level depth in a concentration prepares graduates to work and study independently or as members of teams in which they will be asked to be experts in one area, while understanding and using effectively other natural and social science knowledge and investigative approaches. Admission to the Major New students who wish to enter ENSP may do so by selecting the major on their application for admission. Once on campus, students may declare ENSP during a meeting with the Associate Director. Please review the ENSP website at www.ensp.umd.edu to learn about the program and its requirements prior to your first advising meeting. Requirements for the Major ENSP Core 1. Two introductory courses and three credits each semester, emphasizing Environmental Science in ENSP 101 and Environmental Policy in ENSP 102. 2.

Grading Policy Students who entered the Environmental Science and Policy Program (ENSP) in spring 2002, and thereafter, are required to earn grades of C- or higher in all courses taken within the ENSP core, in all required courses, and restricted electives of the selected area of concentration. Advising Advising is mandatory for all ENSP students in all areas of concentration, regardless of GPA, concentration, or credit level. We want to help you meet program requirements while achieving your academic and career goals. Undergraduate Research Experiences We encourage all interested students to gain research experience. Many beginning ENSP students gain their first research experience by participating in the Maryland Student Researchers Program, which is coordinated by the Maryland Center for Undergraduate Research. More advanced students gain research experience working with their faculty members; in a field assistantship at the USDA - Beltsville Agricultural Research Center or the US FWS - Patuxent Wildlife Research Refuge; or by participating in an NSF-sponsored Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU). Additionally, highly motivated and capable students are encouraged to enroll in Honors-in-ENSP to pursue a self-directed, individual project. Details about all of these opportunities are available on our website. Internships Practical experience is an important part of learning. Whether gained by volunteering, clubs, internships, and/or researching -- all experience contributes to students' professional development, helps determine what they enjoy doing, and makes classwork more meaningful. ENSP maintains an extensive list of internship opportunities on its website ( www.ensp.umd.edu ) and majors receive weekly listserv announcements. Approximately half of our areas of concentrations require an internship; and virtually all ENSP students complete one or more such experiences. To earn credit for an internship, review program requirements and contact the Associate Director at (301)405-8571 regarding ENSP 386 - Internship in Environmental Science and Policy. Honors Program The Honors Program in Environmental Science and Policy provides energetic and capable undergraduates the opportunity to engage in independent study. Interested students must have 45-75 credits at the time of application; a cumulative GPA of 3.25 or higher; and a 3.5 or higher in all courses required for ENSP. Transfer students with equivalent academic records are also encouraged to apply. All students who meet the application requirements are eligible to apply; they need not have been a member of University Honors. The research will be conducted under the supervision of a faculty mentor, usually in the student's area of concentration, and will result in an Honors thesis. More information about admission, program requirements, and academic resources is available on the website (www.ensp.umd.edu). Scholarships and Financial Assistance The Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) administers all types of federal, state and institutional financial assistance programs and, in cooperation with other university offices, participates in the awarding of scholarships to deserving students.

Fire Protection Engineering (ENFP) A. James Clark School of Engineering 3106 JM 301-405-3992 www.fpe.umd.edu Chair: Hill, B. Hoskins, D. Johnson, E. Kuligowski, R. McDermott, N. Ryder, J. Scheer, J. Simone, J. Sutula Adjunct Professors: R. Roby, J. Professors Emeriti: V. J. F. Mowrer (Assoc Prof Emeritus), J.G. Quintiere, S. Spivak The Major Fire Protection Engineering is concerned with the applications of scientific and technical principles to the dynamics, mitigation, and suppression of fire. This includes the effects of fire on people, on structures, on commodities, and on operations. The identification of fire hazards and their risk, relative to the cost of protection, is an important aspect of fire safety design. The fire protection engineering student receives a fundamental engineering education involving the subjects of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. The program builds on other core engineering subjects of materials, fluid mechanics, thermodynamics and heat transfer with emphasis on principles and phenomena related to fire. Fluid mechanics includes applications to sprinkler design, suppression systems, and smoke movement. Heat transfer introduces the student to principles of evaporation for liquid fuels. The subject of combustion is introduced involving premixed and diffusion flames, ignition and flame spread, and burning processes. Laboratory experience is gained by being exposed to standard fire tests and measurements. Design procedures are emphasized for systems involving suppression, detection, alarm, and building safety requirements. The background and application of codes and standards are studied to prepare the student for practice in the field. System concepts of fire safety and methods of analysis are presented. A senior design or research project is required which gives the student an opportunity to explore issues beyond the normal classroom environment. The Bachelor of Science in Fire Protection Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org, 111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, MD 21202-4012, telephone: (410) 347-7700. Program Objectives The educational objectives of the undergraduate program in Fire Protection Engineering are to produce graduates who: 1. have the technical knowledge and skills needed to practice fire protection engineering in a variety of modern professional settings; 2. have the basic competencies needed to pursue advanced studies in fire protection engineering and related fields; 3. have the ability to understand and communicate the societal, environmental, economic and safety implications of engineering decisions; 4. are prepared to attain professional certification and licensure; and 5. appreciate the need to maintain continual professional competency and to practice ethically. The practice of fire protection engineering has developed from the implementation and interpretation of codes and standards directed at fire safety. These safety codes contain technical information and prescriptions derived from experience and research. Research has also led to quantitative methods to assess aspects of fire and fire safety. Thus, fire protection engineers need to be versed in the current technical requirements for fire safety and in the scientific principles that underlie fire and its interactions.

Casebier (Visiting Assistant Professor) The Major The French Language, Literature and Culture Major (FREN), www.french.umd.edu, www.sllc.umd.edu, is housed in the Department of French and Italian (FRIT). The undergraduate major in French is centered on the study of the French language and the literatures and cultures of the French and Francophone people. Our faculty members teach a wide variety of courses in culture, literature, linguistics, stylistics, cinema, civilization, contemporary France, and women's studies. Students who complete the requirements for the major can expect to be able to speak, read, write, and understand French at a level that would allow them to communicate with native speakers, to recognize and interpret the diverse cultural perspectives and products of the French-speaking world, and to be culturally sensitive members of society. Students of French have the option of living in the Language House. University faculty-led programs in Nice (semester or year-long) and Montpellier (summer) are offered by the Department, and all students majoring in French are encouraged to participate in either or both of these programs as an integral part of their curriculum. Students may also consider a double major in French and another discipline, such as arts and humanities majors, business, international relations, economics, or journalism. Students can satisfy the ARHU Global Engagement Requirement by taking the appropriate French language course sequence (103>203), or by taking a higher level French course. Students must take language acquisition courses sequentially, i.e., 103, 203, 204, 250, etc. Once credit has been received in a higher-level language acquisition or grammar course, a lower-level course may not be taken for credit. Advanced students of French may substitute 300- or 400-level electives for FREN204, 250, or 301, in consultation with the Advisor.

Zajacz (Visit Res Assoc) The Major Geology is the science of the Earth. In its broadest sense, geology concerns itself with planetary formation and subsequent modification, with emphasis on the study of planet Earth. Geologists study Earth's internal and surficial structure and materials, the chemical and physical processes acting within and on Earth, and utilize the principles of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology to understand our planet and its environments. Geological sciences encompass all the physical, chemical, and biological aspects of Earth. Increasingly, geologists are taking a holistic approach in the collection and interpretation of data about Earth, which means that the wider context of the geological sciences is broad and diverse. In studying Earth as a system, we are concerned with geology and geophysics, hydrology, oceanography and marine science, meteorology and atmospheric science, planetary science, and soil science. A major in any relevant discipline can lead to a satisfying career within the geological sciences. In general, graduate training is expected for advancement to the most rewarding positions and for academic employment. Program Objectives Geologists are employed by governmental, industrial, and academic organizations. Geologists work in exploration for new mineral and hydrocarbon resources, as consultants on engineering and environmental projects, as teachers and researchers in universities, and in many other challenging positions. For many, the attraction of a career in geology is the ability to divide time between work in the field, the laboratory, and the office. Although the employment outlook within geology varies with the global economic climate, the long-range outlook is good. This is because our dwindling energy, mineral, and water resources, along with increasing concerns about natural hazards and environmental issues, present new challenges for geologists. Program Learning Outcomes The Geology Program at Maryland includes a broad range of undergraduate courses to accommodate both Geology majors and students within the Environmental Science and Policy Program. Within the Geology major, a requirement exists for a senior undergraduate research project to be performed under the direction of a faculty advisor. This requirement provides invaluable experience in writing proposals and reports, gathering, analyzing and evaluating data, and delivering scientific talks. In addition, a Departmental Honors Program and a combined B.S./M.S. Program are available. Requirements for the Major Requirements for the Geology Major, Professional Track The geology curriculum is designed to meet the requirements of industry, graduate school, and government. For the B.S. degree, the students are required to complete the departmental requirements (49 credits) and the supporting requirements (23/24 credits) in addition to the General Education Program requirements and the completion of at least 120 credits. The department requires that to receive a degree in Geology, students must have a grade of C- or better in the required geology courses, and an average of C- or better in the supporting courses. Courses required for the B.S. in Geology are listed below. Some courses require field trips for which the students are expected to pay for room (if required) and board. Field camp is taken during the summer at institutions other than the University of Maryland, College Park, that offer camps approved by the department. Geology Courses One of the following: GEOL 100/110\u2014Physical Geology and Laboratory Geochemistry GEOL of the following: CHEM 131\u2014Fundamentals of General Chemistry and CHEM 132\u2014 Fundamentals of General Chemistry Laboratory (4) CHEM 135\u2014Chemistry for Engineers and CHEM 136\u2014 Chemistry for Engineers Laboratory (4) MATH 140\u2014Calculus I MATH 141\u2014Calculus II One of the following: PHYS 141\u2014Principles of Physics 161\u2014General Physics: 171\u2014Introductory Physics: Mechanics and of the following: PHYS 142\u2014 Principles of Physics PHYS 260 General Physics: Vibration, Waves, Heat, Electricity and Magnetism and PHYS 261 General Physics: Vibrations, Waves, Heat, Electricity and Magnetism (Laboratory) PHYS 272 Introductory Physics: Fields BIOM 301\u2014Introduction to Biometrics Any of GEOL444, 445, 446 or 472 not already completed to meet the requirements above or any other 3-4 credit 300 or 400 level Geology course not listed above. Requirements for the Geology Major, Secondary Education Track The Secondary Education Track in Geology leads to a B. S. degree in Geology with special emphasis on course work that helps prepare the student for teaching at the secondary school level. Further coursework and student teaching are required for an education certification. This track also prepares the student for work as a geologist in government or industry, or for further graduate study, although students primarily intending to attend graduate school in geology are advised to choose the Professional Track. Students seeking professional opportunities in secondary education are urged, also, to consult with advisors in the College of Education. Relative to the professional geology track, in the secondary education track, there is a reduction of two upper-level geology requirements, and the addition of two education courses and the option of an atmospheric and oceanic science or astronomy course. Further coursework in education (including student teaching) will be required in order to obtain a Maryland State Teaching Certification. Although geology is by nature interdisciplinary, it is recommended that students consider taking additional courses in biology and the philosophy of science in order to add to their educational breadth. The department requires that to receive a degree in Geology, students must have a grade of C- or better in the required geology courses, and a C- average or better in the supporting courses.

Although designed to provide an integrated experience of undergraduate and graduate work, the combined B.S./M.S. program is not a course of study separate and distinct from the traditional B.S. and M.S. Students in the combined B.S./M.S. program will, at any given time, be either undergraduate or graduate students. The program provides the opportunity for a superior student to telescope these degrees by taking up to nine graduate credits (600-level or higher) while still an undergraduate and counting them toward both degrees. A grade of \"B\" or better must be earned in each of these courses. Under optimal circumstances, one might complete both degrees in five years. Actual completion time will vary depending on one's individual circumstances. The master's thesis may be a continuation of work begun as part of the undergraduate senior thesis. Acceptance into the combined B.S./M.S. normally would occur after the end of the sophomore year. The minimum requirements for acceptance into this program are similar to those for the geology honors program, namely an overall GPA of at least 3.0 at the end of the sophomore year and a GPA of 3.0 or better in all courses required for the major. Interested eligible students must provide the following material to be considered: 1. At least three letters of recommendation. At least one of these must be from a prospective graduate advisor, who must outline the applicant's sources of potential funding. 2. An essay or statement of purpose. 3. An interview with the undergraduate Honors Director and the Graduate Director. 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 354Based on this, students may be provisionally accepted into the program. Students so accepted will be permitted to enroll in appropriate graduate-level courses. The combined B.S./M.S. program allows 9 credits of graduate courses (600-level or above) to be counted towards both the B.S. and M.S. degrees. A grade of \"B\" or better must be earned in each of these courses. Acceptance is provisional pending satisfaction of the following: 1. Completion of the undergraduate curriculum. 2. A GPA of 3.5 or better in GEOL 393 and GEOL 394. 3. Maintenance of a 3.0 overall GPA and a GPA of 3.0 or better in all courses required for the major. 4. Successful completion of the General GRE exam, usually taken during the fall term of the senior year. 5. Formal application and admission to the Graduate School. Your application for graduate admission is completely separate from your application to the combined B.S./M.S. Your participation in the combined BS/MS as an undergraduate does not give you priority over other graduate applicants. Upon enrollment as a graduate student, the participant may designate the graduate courses that should be counted toward both degrees. Requirements for the Minor Geology An undergraduate minor recognizes concentrated study in a designated field in the College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences. The award of a minor will be noted on the student's transcript at the time of graduation. These minors may be earned by students not majoring in geology and are administered by the geology undergraduate studies director. A grade of \"C-\" or better must be earned in all courses required for the minor. See www.geol.umd.edu for more information.

The minors are also appropriate for majors outside the college with appropriate matches including, but not limited to: Geography/Remote Sensing (Surficial Geology) Engineering and Material Sciences (Earth Material Properties) Evolutionary Biology and Physical Anthropology (Earth History) Biology, Biological Diversity, and Ecology (Earth History, Hydrology) Planetary Science The Departments of Astronomy and Geology jointly sponsor a minor program in Planetary Science. Details about this minor and its course requirements are provided in Chapter 8. Advising The Geology Undergraduate Studies Director serves as the advisor for the geology majors, 1119 Geology Building, 301-405-4379. Students who have been away more than two years may find that due to curriculum changes the courses they have taken may no longer be adequate preparation for the courses required to complete the major. Students in this situation must meet with the Undergraduate Studies Director to make appropriate plans. Honors Program Admission to the Program is by invitation of the Honors Committee, normally at the end of the sophomore year and normally will be extended to students with an overall GPA of 3.0 or better and a GPA of 3.0 or better in all courses required for the major. Graduation with Honors normally requires completion of the curriculum, a GPA of 3.5 or better in GEOL 393H and GEOL 394H, and maintenance of a 3.0 overall GPA and a GPA of 3.0 or better in all courses required for the major. Maintenance of a GPA of 3.5 or above and a grade of A in both GEOL 393H and GEOL 394H will earn the distinction of Graduation with High Honors. The curriculum for Honors in Geology follows the Honors College Track I: Thesis Option with a 15 credit minimum. 1. The requirement for upper division Honors courses will be met by a minimum of 9 hours as follows: a. GEOL 489H Recent Advances in Geology (3 credit hours), and b. 6 credit hours from the following: i) a 3 credit hour graduate-level course approved by the Departmental Honors Committee ii) Honors Option project in a three or four credit hour upper-level course from the offerings in the Geology Department iii) no more than one Honors College seminar (3 credit hours) addressing a relevant topic in natural sciences.

Wiedel The Major How do you see the future? More of everything: food, parks, leisure, personal electronic devices, peace between the nations? Or more people, new diseases, traffic gridlock, and starvation? Will there still be crabs and oysters from the Chesapeake Bay ? The world is changing at unprecedented rates, primarily as a result of human actions. Opportunities for increased well-being of humans and the environment abound. On the other hand, competition for resources such as fresh water and oil is reaching crisis proportions. The future of humanity depends on skillful management of our environment by planning the social, urban, suburban and rural settings where we work, live and play. Expert care of the environment is needed to maintain supplies of food, natural products, water, and the other resources on which life depends. New insights into the social, economic and urban environment can help control poverty and crime. Geographical Sciences concerns the relations between people and the natural world, the effects of ecosystems on human beings and vice versa, the choices people make, the effects of past actions on people today, and the effects of today's choices on future generations. Courses offered by this department may be found under the acronym GEOG. Program Learning Outcomes Having completed the degree program, students should have acquired the following knowledge and skills: Possess an understanding of the nature of the physical systems and processes of the Earth's environment and their interactions.1. Understand the nature of the geographical approach and its value in understanding human-environment relationships.2. Know the methods and techniques of data collection, display and analysis used in the study of environmental systems.3. Academic Programs and Departmental Facilities The Geographical Science Department has two 25-seat computer teaching laboratories that are used in undergraduate coursework, particularly in GIS/Remote Sensing courses. There are different types of equipment for field research and remote sensing, and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) are also available. Requirements for the Major Within any of the specializations available in the geographical sciences program it is possible for students to adjust their programs to fit their individual interests. The geographical sciences major totals 35 semester hours. In addition to the 35 semester hours, the geographical sciences major is required to take an additional 15 semester hours of supporting course work outside of the department. The hours can be either in one department or in an area of specialization. An area of specialization requires that a written program of courses be reviewed and placed on file by the department advisor. Visit or call the Advising Office, Lefrak 2108, 301-405-4073, e-mail geog-advise@umd.edu, or see the web page at www.geog.umd.edu. Supporting courses generally are related to the area of specialty in geographical sciences. The pass-fail option is not applicable to major or supporting courses. A minimum grade of C- in each course is required for major and supporting courses. Students must have a minimum 2.0 cumulative grade point average across all courses, including the supporting sequence, used to satisfy the major degree requirements.

Related Programs Geographic Information Science/Computer Cartography Major The Geographical Sciences Department offers an important area of specialization: GIS and Computer Cartography. The Bachelor of Science degree program in Geographic Information Science and Computer Cartography is designed to give students the technical skills needed to acquire, manage and analyze very large amounts of geographic data. Students will get extensive computer training in digital processing of remote sensing observations and cartographic vector data, spatial analysis, and the display of information products. Almost everything we do involves geographic information, from deciding where to live and travel, to environmental monitoring and urban planning. Influenced by computer technology, the academic disciplines of geographic information science such as remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS), and computer cartography have evolved dramatically in the past few decades. Remote sensing is the science of obtaining geographic information from aircraft and satellites. GIS technology manages and analyzes different forms of digital geographic data, and this field has been growing at an extraordinary rate. Computer cartography has revolutionized traditional cartography to vastly improve map making and visualization of geographic information in a multimedia environment. The required courses for GIS majors are as follows: Required Courses GEOG201 Geography of Environmental Systems 3 GEOG202 The World in Cultural Perspective 3 GEOG211 Geography of Environmental Systems Laboratory 1 GEOG212 The World in Cultural Perspective Lab 1 PHYSICAL Upper-level physical geography course 3 HUMAN Upper-level physical human geography course 3 GEOG306Introduction to Geographic Methods for the Geographic Environmental Sciences3 ELECT 300.400Upper-level geography electives 3 GEOG372 Remote Sensing 3 GEOG373 Geographic Information Systems 3 GEOG375 Computer Cartography 3 GEOG472 Remote Sensing: Digital Processing and Analysis 3 GEOG473 Geographic Information Systems and Spatial Analysis 3 Total Credits 35 Supporting Courses Supporting courses approved by GEOG advisor 12 One from MATH220 Elementary Calculus I 3 MATH140 Calculus I 4 Supporting area courses must be taken from a list provided by the department.

Vietri The Major Government and Politics is one of the largest majors on campus with approximately 1,000 students taking courses in American politics, international relations, comparative politics, political theory, political philosophy, law, public policy, and environmental policy. Its large and diverse group of students are mentored by faculty through a variety of in and out of classroom experiences and have been extremely successful in garnering campus and national awards, acceptance to competitive law and graduate programs, and exciting careers in all levels of government and the private sector. Students also benefit from a large and active group of local alumni who have reached the highest levels of their respective careers and who actively meet, recruit, and mentor current students. Courses offered by this department may be found under the acronym GVPT. Program Objectives The Department of Government and Politics offers programs for the general student as well as for students who are interested in careers in government, the public sector, foreign assignment, teaching, a variety of graduate programs, and law schools. Satisfactory completion of requirements leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree in Government and Politics. The study of politics is both an ancient discipline and a modern social science. The origin of the discipline can be traced back to the earliest times when philosophers, statesmen, and citizens studied the nature of government, justice, responsibility, and the consequences of political action. More recently, the study of politics has also emphasized scientific analysis and methods of observations about politics. Today, the discipline reflects a broad effort to collect data about politics and governments utilizing relatively new techniques developed by all of the social sciences. The Department of Government and Politics combines philosophical and scientific concerns in its overall program as well as in specific courses. It emphasizes such broad areas as political development, policy analysis, social justice, political economy, conflict, and human rights. These broad conceptual areas are integral components of study in the discipline. The areas are commonly referred to as American government and politics; comparative government; political theory; international relations; public administration; public law; public policy and political behavior. Program Learning Outcomes Having completed the degree program, students should have acquired the following knowledge and skills: An understanding of basic political science concepts including power, institutions, political systems, theories of the state, political conflict, citizenship, and contending analytical and theoretical approaches Proficiency in research and analytical skills using either quantitative methods and or library skills A basic knowledge of the methods, approaches, or theories used in accumulating and interpreting information applicable to the discipline of political science Effective oral and written communication skills to clearly and coherently present information in the discipline of political science 7.

All students are required to see an advisor before they register for their senior year of classes, typically between 75 and 89 credits earned. Undergraduate Research Experiences Undergraduate GVPT majors are strongly encouraged to participate in independent research with GVPT faculty members. The independent study option provides students opportunities to work one-on-one with a faculty member doing research on a topic of the student's choosing. Students should expect to devote approximately 12 hours per week for 16 weeks to the independent study. Students should also expect to write a final research paper no less than 40 pages in length. GVPT Advisors are available to assist students in identifying appropriate research topics and in selecting the GVPT faculty mentor. Only six hours of graded GVPT independent study credit will apply toward the 36 hours needed in the major. Internships are generally open only to GVPT majors with junior standing and a 3.0 GPA. Internships Undergraduate GVPT majors are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the university's close proximity to Washington D.C. and Annapolis by completing at least one internship experience. The GVPT Advising Office advertises internship opportunities weekly on the undergraduate blog, and advisors can assist students in identifying other internship opportunities. The department offers two programs through which students can receive academic credit for their internship - the Public Policy Internship Program and the Capitol Hill Internship program. Information on both of these courses is available on the GVPT website, www.bsos.umd.edu/GVPT/undergraduate. Only six hours of graded GVPT internship credit will apply toward the 36 hours needed in the major. Internship credit graded on a pass/fail basis may not be used to satisfy the GVPT major requirements. In no cases may more than 12 internship credits be counted towards the 120 credits needed to graduate. Internships are generally open only to GVPT majors with junior standing and a 3.0 cumulative GPA. Honors Program The aim of the Government and Politics Honors Program is to encourage students with outstanding abilities to accelerate their development and intellectual growth under conditions of greater freedom, greater responsibility, and more individual supervision from their instructors. The program also seeks to provide a community within which students can meet one another and further develop their interests in political science and public affairs.

Yeni-Komshian The Major Hearing and speech sciences is an inherently interdisciplinary field, integrating knowledge from the physical and biological sciences, medicine, psychology, linguistics, and education in order to understand human communication and its disorders. The department curriculum leads to the Bachelor of Arts degree. An undergraduate major in this field provides appropriate background for graduate training in Speech-Language Pathology or Audiology, as well as for graduate work in other disciplines requiring a knowledge of normal or disordered speech, language, or hearing. The student who wishes to work professionally as a speech-language pathologist or audiologist must obtain a graduate degree in order to meet national certification requirements, and most state licensure laws. The hearing and speech sciences curriculum is designed in part to provide supporting course work for majors in related fields, so most course offerings are available to both departmental majors and non-majors. Courses offered by this department may be found under the following acronym: HESP. Permission of an instructor may be obtained to waive course prerequisites for non-majors wishing to take hearing and speech courses of interest. Program Objectives The Department of Hearing and Speech Sciences strives to provide state-of-the-art teaching, research, and clinical services in the areas of Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology. Program Learning Outcomes The undergraduate curriculum in Hearing and Speech Sciences is structured to provide a strong background for graduate training in Speech-Language Pathology, Audiology and Hearing, Language or Speech Sciences. Although required courses at the undergraduate level are identical for all majors, emphasis can be given to individual curricula through the selection of elective courses. Having completed the degree program, students should have acquired the following knowledge and skills: Students will demonstrate application of fundamental concepts of basic sciences (i.e., biological, physical, mathematics/statistics, behavioral and social sciences) to the hearing and speech sciences discipline. Students will demonstrate knowledge of basic communication processes. Students will demonstrate knowledge of speech, language, and hearing disorders and differences, including etiologies and characteristics, prevention, assessment, and intervention. Academic Programs and Departmental Facilities The Department of Hearing and Speech Sciences offers students numerous opportunities to interact with faculty in teaching, research and clinical experiences. Faculty welcome the participation of undergraduates in their research laboratories. The Hearing and Speech Clinic as well as the Language Learning Early Advantage Program (LEAP preschool) in Lefrak Hall allow students to observe the interaction between clinical and research efforts. Admission to the Major The undergraduate curriculum in HESP is structured to provide adequate background for graduate training in Speech-Language Pathology, Audiology and Hearing, Language or Speech Sciences. It is important for HESP students to understand that this major requires a graduate degree in order to pursue a career in this field . Students should be advised that graduate school admissions are highly competitive ; therefore students must perform to the best of their ability throughout the entire undergraduate curriculum in order to be considered for admittance into a graduate program. Requirements for the Major Students majoring in hearing and speech sciences must complete 33 semester hours of required courses satisfy major course requirements. No course with a grade less than C- may count toward major course requirements. In addition to the 33 semester hours needed for a major, 12 semester hours of supporting courses in statistics and other related fields are required. For these 12 hours, a C- average is required. In addition, when a HESP course has a listed pre-requisite, this pre-requisite must have been completed with a grade of C- or better before registration in the subsequent course will be approved. A guide to the major is available through the department office in room 0100 Lefrak Hall or on the departmental website at www.bsos.umd.edu/hesp/ 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 366www.bsos.umd.edu/hesp/ Course sequencing is extremely important within this major. Advising for majors is mandatory.

A more complete list of these courses can be found on the Hearing and Speech Department website. PSYC100 Introduction to Psychology 3 STATone Statistics course from EDMS451, PSYC200, or BIOM3013 ELECT two courses from Allied/Related Fields 6 Finally, HESP majors must complete BOTH a biological and a physical science to satisfy national certification standards for speech-language pathologists and audiologists. Specifically, to meet the general education requirements of the university and the requirements for the major, HESP majors must complete PHYS102/103 lab as the physical science requirement and a life science course that is based on the biology of the human system and not plants or insects. Requirements for the Minor Requirements for the HESP minor include the following coursework: HESP 202-Introduction to Speech 407-Hearing Science PLUS 2 courses in one of the two elective areas: 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 367Elective option 1 (Speech-Language Pathology Focu s) HESP 305-Anatomy/Physiology of the Speech Mechanism, and HESP 402, 404, 406, 410 Elective option 2 (Audiology focus) HESP 311-Anatomy/Physiology/Pathology of the Auditory to Audiology TOTAL CREDITS: 21 Notes: All classes must be completed with a grade of C- or better; as with HESP majors, students must obtain a grade of C- or better in a class in order to enroll in any courses that require that class as a pre-requisite. This course sequence acquaints the student with the primary basic science background in the speech, language and hearing sciences, and permits the student to select two courses in the specific professional areas of speech, language or hearing, based on the student's primary interest area. This minor is designed for the student in other majors (such as Psychology, Education, Linguistics, FOLA, etc.) who may have plans to attend graduate school in the fields of Speech-Language Pathology or Audiology. These courses are widely viewed as pre-requisite for admission to such programs and constitute a proportion (but not the full extent) of classwork required for eventual post M.A. or post-Au.D. certification by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) as either a Speech- Language Pathologist or Audiologist. Because both graduate programs and ASHA may require additional coursework, the student pursuing the HESP minor is strongly encouraged to meet with a HESP academic advisor to ensure that eventual educational goals are properly addressed. The HESP minor does not qualify an individual to work professionally as a Speech-Language Pathologist or Audiologist, but does provide a proportion of the coursework required to practice in the State of Maryland as a Speech-Language Pathology Assistant. Advising Advising for HESP undergraduate majors is MANDATORY before registration each semester. Students will be notified by e-mail of their registration date or they may check their registration status by going to Testudo and clicking on \"Appointment and Registration status\". Students should schedule an advising meeting no sooner than one week prior to their registration date as this prevents students from having to return for another appointment due to closed classes. Advising appointments may be made by going to http://hespadvisingcalendar.umd.edu/ . Advising is always available to students regarding academic and major choices, career planning, and/or academic concerns. Undergraduate Research Experiences Undergraduates are encouraged to work with a faculty member in the Hearing and Speech Sciences Department. This can be facilitated through the Maryland Center for Undergraduate Research, the Emerging Behavioral and Social Science Scholars Program or by exploring research topics listed by faculty members on the HESP website. Students may work with faculty members on a one-to-one basis as a volunteer research assistant or recieve credit for their experience. The number of credits that a student may earn is determined by the faculty researcher. Typically the student is expected to work 3 hours for each credit recieved in a semester. Unless the student is involved in true independent research, they should enroll in HESP 499 with the Pass/Fail grade option. Please note that individual professors may have special requirements for participation in the program. You will need to contact the professor that you wish to work with before enrolling in HESP 499 to obtain their permission and their individual section number needed to register. The University limit for 499 credits is six. Internships Internships (even if they are not directly related to Hearing and Speech) are an excellent way to obtain experience in the workplace. Students are encouraged to complete internships through the BSOS Social Science Internship Practicum or BSOS Experiential Learning programs. Honors Program The objective of the HESP Honors program is to encourage and recognize superior academic achievement and scholarship by providing opportunities for interested, capable, and energetic undergraduates to engage in independent study. A research project will be conducted under the supervision of a faculty mentor and will result in an Honors thesis. Program Goals The goals of the HESP Honors program are as follows: Educate students to think independently on a broad range of ideas and issues related to the study of Hearing and Speech Sciences. Provide opportunities for in depth, scholarly and scientific analysis of significant and current topics in the Hearing and Speech Sciences. Provide students with the experience of undertaking a research project. Benefits of the Program Honors students get the opportunity to work closely with faculty and participate in outside-the-classroom learning experiences. Graduating from the Honors program is an excellent way to stand out as an exceptional candidate for graduate school, and thesis-writing experience will help you once you get there! Additionally, Honors students may take graduate courses and apply the credits toward their undergraduate degree. Program Overview 1. The HESP Honors program is a three semester sequence, typically spanning from the Fall of Junior year until the Fall of Senior year. 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 3682. Interested students must apply to be considered for the HESP Honors Program by the deadline posted for each year (typically June 1 preceding the Fall of Junior year). 3. Students must complete 9 credits of HONR seminars or HESP graduate courses in a subject that supports the proposed course of study or some combination of the two. One of the required HONR seminars towards these 9 credits is HESP499H (3 credits). 4. Students will be expected to complete an Honors Thesis with the assistance of a thesis advisor. The thesis culminates in an oral defense. Students must complete 6 credits of HESP Honors research (HESP 469A and B) for the thesis. For students under CORE requirements, three of the HESP Honors research credits may be used to fulfill the CORE Advanced Studies requirement upon successful completion of the thesis defense. Please meet with the Undergraduate Advisor or Director of Honors program for more information on the HESP Honors program.

Undergraduate Research Experiences There are a variety of opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in research in Human Development. Faculty's research focuses on a wide number of topics pertaining to human development and learning. Fieldwork Opportunities An integral component of the Early Childhood Education program at the University of Maryland is a series of field placements (N=5) of increasing complexity/responsibility that serve to complement university coursework. Field placements contribute to the programmatic mission of preparing knowledgeable, skilled and reflective practitioners who base their practice on theory, research, and pedagogy appropriate for the developing child. Interns observe, interact and teach children ages 0 (6 weeks per child care licensing) to 8 in authentic settings. The first of these field placements typically occurs in the sophomore year (and occasionally during spring of the freshman year) and is associated with a course entitled EDHD 220, Exploring Teaching in Early Childhood Education. Early childhood education candidates experience a semester-long practicum (one half day per week) with both preschool and school age children. During fall of the junior year, the practicum is linked to EDHD419A Human Development and Learning in School Settings: Infants-Toddlers. Candidates complete selected observations of infants in child care centers, family childcare centers and community-based institutions that care for infants. These observations are followed by an eight-week placement in a child care setting in which candidates observe and interact with toddlers.The culminating early field placement begins in the spring semester of the junior year. Candidates experience a semester-long placement with three, four or five year olds in a Head Start or pre-kindergarten classroom. The candidates spend six hours per week in the classroom plus a full week of half days. Internships The capstone experience for the program is a yearlong internship in a Professional Development School (PDS), which is a Title I school with large populations of students of color, English Language Learners and those who receive free and reduced meals. The internship is divided into two phases, approximately 110 days over the course of two consecutive semesters. For more details, contact the Early Childhood Education program advisor (301-405-2344). Honors Program Human Development offers two University Honors seminars: HONR 219Y: Merging the Multiple Me's: The Developmental Origins of the Integrated Young Adult Self HONR 228R: Parenting and Poverty: The Effects of Growing Up Poor on Children's Development Student Societies and Professional Organizations Student Educators of Young Children (SEYC) at the University of Maryland SEYC is a student organization sponsored by the Maryland Association for the Education of Young Children (MDAEYC), an affiliate of the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC).

Suriano Affiliate Professors: N. Fox, J. Herf, K. Holum, R. Igel, S. Selden Affiliate Associate Professors: H. Brodsky (Assoc Prof J. G. Berlin (Emerita) Visiting Assoc Prof), E. Gonen Assoc), A. Legutko (Visit Lecturer), P. Peri (Visit Asst Prof), P. Scham (Visit Asst Prof) The Major The Major in Jewish Studies provides undergraduates with a framework for the organized and interdisciplinary study of the history, philosophy, and literature of the Jews from antiquity to the present. Jewish Studies draws on a vast literature in a number of languages, especially Hebrew and Aramaic, and includes the Bible, the Talmud, and medieval and modern Hebrew literature. Yiddish language and literature compose an important sub-field. Courses offered by this department may be found under the following acronym(s): JWST, HEBR, ISRL, and RELS. Program Objectives The Meyerhoff Center and Program for Jewish Studies encourages research and provides instruction about the rich history and culture of the Jewish people from earliest times to the present day. Dedicated to the highest standards of scholarship, the program offers a wide array of courses in Hebrew Language and Literature, Jewish History, Bible, Rabbinics, Jewish Philosophy, and Yiddish Language and Literature. These courses form one of the largest undergraduate Jewish Studies programs in North America. In addition, the Jewish Studies program supports faculty research projects and organizes frequent academic conferences and lectures in order to bring the fruits of scholarship to a wider public. The Jewish Studies Program seeks to provide undergraduate majors with an appreciation for the interdisciplinary nature of Jewish Studies, understanding that Jewish literary texts, Jewish history, and Jewish culture and thought are, to a large degree, inseparable. Students are expected to master the Hebrew language and acquire facility in reading, understanding, analyzing, and interpreting texts both in Hebrew and in English translation. In addition, students should be able to pursue independent research and to argue coherently and persuasively in writing. Program Learning Outcomes The Jewish Studies Program seeks to provide undergraduate majors with an appreciation for the interdisciplinary nature of Jewish Studies (understanding that Jewish literary texts, Jewish history, and Jewish culture and thought are to a large degree inseparable). Students who complete the major should acquire the following knowledge and skills: Mastery of modern Hebrew at the advanced level;1. Mastery of the chronological development and major themes of Jewish history and culture;2. Ability to read, analyze, and interpret texts in classical (biblical, rabbinic, medieval), and/or modern literary Hebrew; and3. Ability to conduct independent research and analysis and represent their results in written form, showing mastery of academic tools and formal conventions.4. Academic Programs and Departmental Facilities Study Abroad The Jewish Studies program encourages students to study internationally. In addition to programs run by the University, students study at academic programs in Israel, Europe, and elsewhere. In particular, majors studying in Israel gain the opportunity to improve their Hebrew language skills by taking ulpan, the intensive course in Hebrew offered at those universities, and by practicing their Hebrew with Israelis. In addition, students can take courses in Israeli society and politics, Middle East Studies, and other courses not usually offered at College Park. Scholarship funds are available to majors and non-majors. Please see the section on \"Scholarships and Financial Assistance\" for more information. The Library 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 380The Jewish Studies program has a large and growing Judaica collection at the University of Maryland Libraries that aims to become a major resource and repository for the entire area. The collection includes materials in Jewish history, Hebrew and Yiddish literature, the Bible, Talmud, medieval philosophy, Jewish women, theater, the Holocaust, and modern Israel. In addition to scholarly books and periodicals written in the English, German, Hebrew, Yiddish, Ladino, Arabic, French, Italian, and Slavic languages, the collection includes rare books, musical scores, video and audio recordings, facsimile copies of historical documents, and manuscripts. Israel Studies The recently formed Joseph and Alma Gildenhorn Institute for Israel Studies offers a wide array of lectures, programs, courses, and study abroad opportunities, as well as an academic minor. Jewish Studies majors and minors, as well as other students in the university, can benefit from these programs. Religious Studies The Minor in Religious Studies is an 18-credit course of study that provides students with the opportunity to learn about religion in cross-cultural and trans-historical perspectives. A core course introduces students to the study of world religions, while other courses range widely in their focus, allowing students to learn more about sacred texts, traditions, practices, philosophies, and material culture. Courses may focus on a single religious tradition, a region or period of history, or a concentrated approach to the analysis of religion and religious culture. Courses for the minor are drawn from such departments and programs as Anthropology, Art History and Archaeology, Classics, Government and Politics, History, Honors, Jewish Studies, Philosophy, and Women's Studies. Admission to the Major The Major in Jewish Studies requires advanced Hebrew skills. Many students may choose to prepare for these requirements by studying Hebrew on their own or by enrolling in the University's sequence of beginning and intermediate Hebrew courses. Placement in Courses The Foreign Language Placement Test in Hebrew is used to determine in which Hebrew course students should enroll. For more information, contact hebrew-advise@umd.edu. Requirements for the Major The undergraduate major requires 48 semester hours (27 hours minimum at the 300-level or above). Students enroll in 39 credits of Jewish Studies courses, and 9 additional credits in supporting courses from a field or fields outside Jewish Studies. Jewish Studies courses for the major may include courses offered by Jewish Studies or cross-listed with other units. By satisfying the Hebrew language requirements of the major, Jewish Studies majors will automatically fulfill the Global Engagement Requirement of the College of Arts and Humanities. A minimum grade of C- is required in all courses offered toward major requirements. An overall GPA of 2.0 in the major is required for graduation. 1.

To make an appointment to explore or declare a minor, go to www.arhu.umd.edu/undergraduate/academics/minors Minor in Religious Studies Religious Studies is an interdisciplinary field that enables students to study the texts, culture, history, beliefs, and practices of the religions of the world, present and past. The minor in Religious Studies draws from a wide range of departments and programs (including Anthropology, Art History, Classics, English, History, Jewish Studies, and Philosophy) and offers the opportunity for both in-depth and wide-ranging study. A required core course, RELS 216, introduces students to religions of the world and to the academic study of religion (In place of this course, students may take RELS 289). In addition to this course, students are required to take three courses at the upper level and another two at any level. Completion of coursework includes fulfillment of a breadth requirement, which demonstrates that students have been exposed to a variety of religious traditions, periods, and geographic regions. Selection of courses in consultation with the advisor will ensure that students complete this breadth requirement. Many courses are now offered with the RELS prefix. Other regularly-offered courses that may be counted toward the minor are: ARTH 200, ARTH 201, ARTH 262, ENGL 263, ENGL 277, ENGL 477, GERM 283, GERM 287, many courses in JWST and HONR. Other courses may be taken with the permission of the minor advisor. Requirements: RELS 216 or RELS 289I: Introduction to the Study of World Religions. Three courses at the 300-level or above. These courses can be in any of a variety of subjects, chosen in consultation with an advisor. See 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 382Breadth requirement below. Two additional courses at any level. Chosen in consultation with an advisor. See Breadth requirement. Breadth requirement The breadth requirement ensures that students are exposed to a diversity of religious phenomena. Most Religious Studies students will complete this requirement simply by sleecting from the wide variety of courses available to them. Students with particular interests (in a single approach, like Art History, or a single setting, like contemporary North America) will need to take at least one course that falls outside their particular focus of interest. Students will need to demonstrate: A. Exposure to a diversity of religious traditions (understood to include African religions, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism, among others) in coursework that extends beyond a single geographic area (such as the Americas, Asia, or the Mediterranean world). B. Exposure to diverse temporal periods (including antiquity, the medieval and early modern periods, and modernity). C. Experience of multiple approaches to religious phenomena or the study of religion (for example, art history, philosphy, historical approaches, and comparative methods). D. Depth: At least one course must incorporate the focused study of a single religious tradition or cluster of traditions (see item A for traditions). Examples: A student with an academic focus in religions of the ancient Mediterranean might complete the breadth requirement with a single course on Asian religions. A student concentrating on art historical approaches to religion might take one course in philosophy or literature. A student whose interests run to comparative and cross-cultural coursework might take a course in the focused study of a single tradition. A minimum of 9 credits must be at the upper level. All courses must be passed with a grade of 'C-' or above. An overall GPA of 2.0 in the minor is required for graduation. A list of qualifying courses is available from the advisor to the RELS program. At least six credits of upper-level credit must be taken at the University of Maryland. No more than six credits may be taken at an institution other than Maryland. In keeping with University policy, no more than six credits may also be applied to a major.

Up to two courses may be taken at another university if the courses are approved in advance by the minor 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 383aAdvisor as substantially similar in quality to these and the subject matter is relevant. These would include credits earned in non-UM study abroad programs as applicable. No courses with an earned grade below \"C-\" may count towards a minor. An overall GPA of 2.0 in the minor is required for graduation. Advising Majors in Jewish Studies have mandatory advising every semester. They must meet with the advisor before being allowed to register for classes for the next semester. You can reach the Jewish Studies advisor at jwst-advise@umd.edu or 301-405-7640. (Students with an additional major will have additional advising requirements depending on the major and/or college of the additional major.) Please note that Jewish Studies majors must also meet with a College of Arts and Humanities advisor: during their first semester when they complete 45-55 credits when they complete 90-100 credits Students who wish to minor in Jewish Studies must meet with the advisor at least once, mainly to declare the minor. What to expect from advising During advising meetings, the advisor will chart a student's progress through the major or minor. The kinds of questions that the advisor will ask include \"what courses are you taking,\" \"what courses do you intend to take?,\" \"are you interested in studying abroad?,\" and \"how are you doing in your classes?\" The advisor will make notes and go through the Major or Minor Advising Form to ensure that the student understands the major's or minor's requirements, what courses to take, and when to take them. Every student will get a copy of his or her Major or Minor Advising Form at the end of each meeting for his or her own records. Note that students who have not yet declared Jewish Studies as their major must meet with the Jewish Studies advisor and then meet with an ARHU advisor. During this first meeting with the Jewish Studies advisor, the student will learn about the Four-Year Plan, which is a schedule of classes developed by ARHU and Jewish Studies for the typical Jewish Studies major to follow. It outlines which courses should be taken during which semesters. What to bring to an advising meeting. When students come to a meeting with the Jewish Studies advisor, they should bring a list of courses they are thinking about taking, as well as any other requirements they need to fulfill for another major or minor. Other documents, such as the requirements for another major or minor, descriptions of courses taken abroad, and previous Major or Minor Advising Forms, are also helpful to bring. Honors Program The Honors Program in Jewish Studies is designed to encourage Jewish Studies majors with excellent grades and strong academic interests to pursue an individual research project of their own design, in consultation with and under the direction of a faculty advisor. The Program consists of twelve credits taken in a student's Junior and Senior years, culminating in the writing of an honors thesis. Students who complete the Honors Program are deemed to have completed the research seminar requirement for the major, typically completed through JWST 409. Junior Year : Students apply for admission to the Honors Program in the Fall of their Junior year, and, upon admission, enroll in the Honors Seminar (JWST 408) (3 credits) in the Spring of their Junior year. During this time students are expected to develop a general research plan to be approved by the prospective thesis advisor. Thesis advisors will generally belong to the regular or affiliate Jewish Studies faculty. Other faculty may serve as thesis advisor with the written permission of the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Senior Year : In the Fall of their Senior year students select an upper-level course (3 credits) closely related to their research agenda in consultation with the advisor. This may include a regularly offered undergraduate course, independent study, in which case students are encouraged to apply for an Honors Option for that particular course. In addition, students may request permission to enroll in a graduate-level course to complete this part of their requirement. Students who enter the Honors Program with a clearly defined research interest may complete this requirement in their Junior year. In addition, students take 6 credits of JWST 418: Honors Thesis Research, under the direction of their thesis advisor. Typically these will be divided between the Fall and Spring semesters. Students are expected to work out with their advisors clear goals that contribute to the thesis as a whole for each semester of thesis research, and will be graded each semester on the basis of having met those goals. In the second semester, the principal goal will be the completed thesis. Student Societies and Professional Organizations Undergraduate Jewish Studies Organization The goal of the Undergraduate Jewish Studies Organization (UJSO) is to provide non-curricular support for Jewish Studies majors and minors. Such support includes career guidance, cohort development, networking activities, social events, and other programs designed by the UJSO's members. Led by members, the UJSO responds to students' needs that extend beyond the curricula of the Jewish Studies Program. All Jewish Studies majors and minors, as well as other students interested in Jewish Studies, are encouraged to attend meetings and get involved. Scholarships and Financial Assistance The Joseph and Rebecca Meyerhoff Center and Program for Jewish Studies offers scholarships for study abroad and special domestic study programs that have a clear relationship to Jewish Studies. Students wishing to study in Israel are especially encouraged to apply. Applications for scholarships are accepted once in the Fall and once in the Spring.

Students may choose to major in Kinesiology. The Physical Education Major has been suspended and currently is not accepting students to the program. Brief descriptions of each program follow. Students should obtain a current Student Handbook for the Kinesiology degree on the web at www.sph.umd.edu/KNES www.sph.umd.edu/KNES . Both programs require a grade of C- or better in all required course-work. Departmental contact: Dr. Ana Palla-Kane (301-405-2502, anapalla@umd.edu) Program Objectives The overall mission of the Department of Kinesiology is to improve the health and well being of all people through an interdisciplinary understanding of physical activity in its many forms (e.g., exercise, sport, movement activities of daily living). The Department of Kinesiology is committed to providing students with an excellent education in Kinesiology; generating empirical evidence about physical activity; and providing services to the state, nation, and world by furthering and sharing our knowledge and expertise about physical activity. The undergraduate educational mission of the Department of Kinesiology is to enable students to develop an interdisciplinary knowledge of kinesiology, value physical activity and its integration within the discipline, and understand how kinesiologists work to improve the health and well-being of individuals and society. Program Learning Outcomes At the completion of the B.S. degree in Kinesiology, students should demonstrate the following outcomes: 1. Students will interpret, synthesize, and critically analyze research underlying the kinesiological dimensions of physical activity and health. 2. Students will develop principled reasoning skills necessary to apply and extend kinesiology knowledge to address problems that are relevant to physical activity and the health of diverse populations. 3. Students will integrate, interrogate, and communicate the connection between the scholarship of kinesiology and the goals of public health. 4. Students will engage in a diversity of physical activities both within and outside their formal curriculum. 5. Students will integrate their physical activity experiences with kinesiology sub-disciplinary knowledge. Requirements for the Major Physical Education Major The Physical Education degree program is designed to lead to Pre-K-12 teacher certification in the State of Maryland. Maryland teaching certificates are reciprocal with most other states. While this program is designed to provide professional preparation for individuals in public school settings, it also provides excellent preparation for those wishing to pursue other professional opportunities in sport, exercise, or physical activity. Also, due to the scientific foundation of the degree program, an appropriate background is established for future graduate work for those who desire to continue their studies in any area involving human movement and sport. Many courses require prerequisites and proper sequencing 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 385is very important. Not all courses are offered every semester. All interested students are urged to schedule an advising appointment with the program coordinator before declaring this major. Students should consult the department for updated information.

Additional information is available on the College of Education website at www.education.umd.edu/studentinfo/teachercert.html Kinesiology Major This program offers students the opportunity to study the interdisciplinary body of knowledge related to human physical activity and sport, and to pursue specific specializations so that each individual can prepare for a particular career goal within the broad discipline. There is no intent to orient all students toward a particular specialized interest, orientation or career. However, many current students are pursuing careers in medically-related fields (i.e., physical therapy, physician, chiropractor), in the fitness industry (i.e., corporate fitness, personal training, health fitness director) as well as in the sport industry (sport management, sport marketing, events management, equipment sales, athletic director). The program provides a hierarchical approach to the study of human movement. First, a broad core of knowledge is recognized as being a necessary foundation for advanced and more specific courses. Secondly, at the 'Options' level, students select from approved upper level KNES courses, which they believe will provide the knowledge to pursue whatever future goal they set for themselves. To further strengthen specific areas of interest, students should select electives carefully. The program culminates with a senior seminar class in which students write a substantial paper and discuss the implications of research.

Advising Advising is mandatory for Physical Education majors and strongly recommended (but not mandatory) for Kinesiology majors. Advising appointments can be made online at the website ( www.sph.umd.edu/KNES/advising ). Advisors are not assigned to individual students, although certain advisors will handle issues related to policy exceptions, academic difficulties, change of major, study abroad, internships, athletes, and other special cases. Advisors will assist with registration procedures, program updates, University resources, career guidance, and related issues. Students are strongly encouraged to follow their approved academic plan for timely progress throughout the degree program. Changes in the academic plan should be discussed with an academic advisor. Students in both majors are strongly encouraged to join the departmental listserv for weekly departmental and campus updates, internships and jobs information. Instruction on how to join the listserve is available at www.sph.umd.edu/KNES/ugrad/overview_ugrad.html . Walk-in hours are available during the beginning of each semester and advertised through the KNES listserve. Students are encouraged to use the on-line advising appointment process or email an advisor at advisingknes@umd.edu . Undergraduate Research Experiences Undergraduate research experiences are encouraged. Research internships are available from 1 to 3 credits and are recommended at the junior or senior level, following the completion of most Kinesiology core courses. Additional information is available on the UMD Undergraduate Research website (www.ugresearch.umd.edu/) or by contacting Director of the Undergraduate Programs (301 405-2450). Internships Internships are encouraged to assist students in connecting and applying academic and conceptual knowledge to the real world. Most students consider internships during their junior and senior years following the completion of related kinesiology core and options courses. From a practical perspective, internships are invaluable in helping students focus on career options, gain experience, establish professional contacts and, perhaps most importantly, deciding whether a particular field is truly a good fit both professionally and personally. Additional information is available on the department website (www.sph.umd.edu/KNES/ugrad/internship.html) or by contacting the Director of the Undergraduate Programs (301-405-2450).

Nola (Instructor & Assoc Coordinator) Associate Professors: C. Ellis, D. Myers, J.B. Sullivan Assistant Professors: V. Chanse, B. Kweon Lecturers: A. Anderson, A. Ison, J. Leonard The Major The Landscape Architecture curriculum is a four-year professional program. The program is a site-based design discipline that also deals with regional and larger-scale environmental issues. The curriculum, a studio-based design program, integrates natural and social factor analysis into the design process. Digital design studios allow the integration of computer-aided design with fundamental design and drawing skills. The Department of Plant Science and Landscape Architecture offers two additional undergraduate curricula that students may choose: the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Plant Sciences or in Agricultural Sciences and Technology. Information on these majors may be found elsewhere in the catalog. Courses offered by this department may be found under the following acronyms: PLSC and LARC. Program Learning Outcomes Develop knowledge-based skills in the required areas of study. Apply knowledge-based skills to work, collaborate and solve problems, and articulate conclusions. Articulate knowledge of content area and demonstrate competence in professional practice through effective communication skills appropriately tailored to specific audiences. Admission to the Major Landscape Architecture is a limited-enrollment program (LEP). See Chapter 1 of the Undergraduate Catalog for general limited-enrollment program admission policies. Freshman Admission: The program's goal is to have the greater proportion of program majors admitted as freshmen. Most entering freshmen will gain admission to the Landscape Architecture program directly from high school, as space permits. Early application is encouraged to ensure the best possible chance for admission. Transfer Admission: Admission of transfer students is limited by space considerations. Students presenting an acceptable graphic portfolio, evaluated by the landscape architecture faculty, may be exempted from one or both of the first year studios. Landscape architecture faculty will evaluate all other LARC-equivalent courses transferred from another institution. The Academic Review: All students will be subject to an Academic Review after they have completed the first three design studio courses (or their equivalent) in the Landscape Architecture curriculum. To meet the provisions of the review, students must complete: (1) MATH 112 or MATH 115 with a minimum grade of C-, (2) LARC 120 and 160 with a minimum grade of B, and LARC 140 and 141 with a minimum grade of C-, (3) attain a successful review of a portfolio (a minimum of 80 points out of a possible 100) by the landscape architecture faculty to assess graphic and design skills, and (4) attain an overall GPA of at least 2.40. Students who do not meet these requirements will not be allowed to continue in the landscape architecture LEP and will be required to choose another major. Other Policies Which Determine a Student's Retention in the Landscape Architecture Program: A student can only repeat one of the five Academic Review Course Requirements (LARC 120, 140, 141, 160 and MATH 112 or MATH 115). That particular course can only be repeated once. A grade of W (Withdrawn) in a course is counted as an attempt. A student who does not meet the Academic Review requirements will be dismissed from the Program. A student who is dismissed from the program will not be readmitted to the Landscape Architecture LEP. Appeals: Students who are unsuccessful in gaining admission to the Landscape Architecture LEP and believe they have extenuating or special circumstances which should be considered, may appeal in writing to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. The student will be notified in writing of the appeal decision. Students in the Landscape Architecture LEP who do not pass the Academic Review, but believe they have special circumstances that should be considered, should appeal directly to the Coordinator of the Landscape Architecture program. BLA Degree Requirements. The courses and credit hours that define the curriculum leading to the degree of Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (BLA) are described in the next section. The curriculum includes required courses for the major as well as additional general education program requirements and electives. Following the successful Academic Review and acceptance into the LARC Program, students must have an overall average of a C (2.0) to be eligible for the BLA degree. Students must also have grades of C- or better in all required courses with the LARC designation.

Certificate in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Studies College of Arts and Humanities 2417 Marie Mount Hall, 301-405-5428 www.lgbts.umd.edu Director: Dr. and Transgender Studies (LGBT) offers an interdisciplinary undergraduate certificate and a minor designed to examine the lives, experiences, identities and representations of LGBT persons, those who are today described as having a minority sexual orientation or who are gender transgressive. Students study LGBT families and communities, cultures and subcultures; histories, institutions, languages and literatures; economic and political lives; and the complex relations of sexual minorities to the culture and experience of the gender conformant and (hetero)sexual majority. LGBT Studies is an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary field, and promotes the application of new theories and methodologies (e.g., queer, feminist, critical race, and multicultural theories) to established disciplines, and it advances the generation of new knowledge within traditional fields of scholarship. Through study of sexual minorities, students gain an understanding of and respect for other differences in human lives such as age, ability, class, ethnicity, gender, race, and religion.

Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 394Linguistics (LING) College of Arts and Humanities 1401 Marie Mount Hall, 301-405-7002 www.ling.umd.edu C. Phillips, P. Pietroski, P. Resnik, J. Uriagereka, A. Weinberg Assistant Professors: N. Feldman, V. Hacquard, E. Lau, A. Williams Instructors: A. Zukowski (Asst Res Sci) Lecturers: M. Antonisse, T. Bleam The Major The Linguistics Department offers courses on many aspects of language study and an interdisciplinary major leading to a Bachelor of Arts. Language is basic to many human activities and linguistics relates to many other disciplines which include work on language. Work on language has provided one of the main research probes in philosophy and psychology for most of the 20th century. It has taken on a new momentum in the last 70 years and language research has proven to be a fruitful means to cast light on the nature of the human mind and on general cognitive capacity. Several courses focus on a research program which takes as a central question: How do children master their native language? Children hear many styles of speech, variable pronunciations, and incomplete expressions, but, despite this flux of experience, they come to speak and understand speech effortlessly, instantaneously, and subconsciously. Research aims to discover how this happens, how a person's linguistic capacity is represented in the mind, and what the genetic basis for it is. Students learn how various kinds of data can be brought to bear on their central question and how that question influences the shape of technical analyses. The major in Linguistics is designed for students who are primarily interested in human language per se, or in describing particular languages in a systematic and psychologically plausible way, or in using language as a tool to reveal some aspect of human mental capacities. Such a major provides useful preparation for professional programs in foreign languages, language teaching, communication, psychology, speech pathology, and artificial intelligence (and thus in computer work). Program Learning Outcomes The Department of Linguistics B.A. program seeks to expose majors to fundamental questions about the nature of the human mind, using Language as a vehicle for examining this issue. The program aims to cultivate strong empirical research skills, data analysis, application of scientific methodology, and the ability to communicate clear, logical arguments. Students can analyze a sentence from English or another language, providing a syntactic parse tree and evidence for their analysis.1. Students can provide a phonological analysis of any language given a sufficient data set (including data from non-Western languages).2. Students understand and can reproduce arguments for the existence of mental grammar.3. Students understand and can reproduce arguments for a genetic component of human language.4. Students can apply the scientific method to data analysis. Specifically, they can formulate generalizations, specify the predictions of a hypothesis with respect to independent generalizations, and test predictions.5. Academic Programs and Departmental Facilities Students can become involved in a wide range of research activities including computer programming and experimental projects in language acquisition , psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics . Selected undergraduate students work alongside faculty and graduate students\u2014learning to design, execute, and analyze experiments\u2014within our Language Acquisition Lab and our Cognitive Neuroscience of Language Laboratory . For more information about ongoing research, lab facilities, and opportunities for undergraduate involvement, go to the following web pages: http://ling.umd.edu/undergraduate/ http://ling.umd.edu/research/ http://ling.umd.edu/labs/acquisition/ Requirements for the Major A grade of at least 'C-' is required in all major courses. An overall GPA of 2.0 in the major is required for graduation.

Other Requirements for the Major LING 240 must be taken before any other courses in the major; this course serves as a gateway to the major. A grade of C- or better is required in this course before taking further courses in Linguistics. However, a grade of B or higher in Ling240 is a relatively good predictor of continued success in the rest of the major (as courses become more difficult). LING 240 is offered every semester. After LING 240, students should take LING 311 (Syntax I) and LING 321 (Phonology I), as they are prerequisites for other required courses. These courses can be taken together in the same semester. LING 312 (Syntax II) and LING 322 (Phonology II) are generally only offered in the Spring. LING 410 (Grammar and Meaning) is only offered once per year. Optional courses for the major are not necessarily offered on a regular basis. Students should check with the undergraduate advisor to find out which courses will be offered and when. A grade of C- or better is required in prerequisite courses. For the Language Track, the \"15 credits of a single chosen language\" must be courses that focus on language (and not, for example, history, literature or culture taught in the language). The \"structure or history of the language\" course is a linguistics course that focuses on the chosen language. This course must be approved by the linguistics advisor. If no such course is offered by the language department, the linguistics advisor will suggest a substitute. Electives for the Cognition Track must be approved by the linguistics advisor. Requirements for the Minor 15 credit hours: LING 200, 240, 321, 311, and one upper level linguistics elective. All courses presented for the minor must be passed with a grade of 'C-' or better. An overall GPA of 2.0 in the minor is required for graduation. To make an appointment to explore or declare a minor, go to www.arhu.umd.edu/undergraduate/academics/minors Undergraduate Research Experiences There are opportunities in the department for undergraduate students to get involved in doing research. Students interested in research in linguistics should submit a resume and/or project proposal to the undergraduate advisor or to an appropriate faculty member. Attempts will be made to match students with appropriate faculty advisors. The possibility of doing research is not guaranteed for every student, but will depend on the student's skills and the availability and willingness of a faculty member to direct the project. In addition to opportunities during the regular semester to receive course credit for research assistantships, students can also apply for funding to work as a research assistant during the summer through the Linguistics Department Baggett Scholarship program. (More information about the Baggett summer program can be found on the website at: http://www.ling.umd.edu/baggett/) Honors Program Academically talented Linguistics majors with junior standing may petition to become honors candidates in Linguistics. Honors students work on a research project under a faculty advisor, write an honors thesis, and present the work in a public forum.

Leete The Major Two curriculum concentrations are offered through the Logistics, Business, and Public Policy department: Supply Chain Management International Business Supply Chain Management: The predominance of business activity taking place on a global scale has increased the opportunities for integrated supply chain management to have a profound impact on value chain performance. The supply chain encompasses all organizations involved in the production of a good or service and its ultimate delivery to the end consumer. Supply chain managers oversee many varied but inter-related processes including the flows of materials and information. Within supply chain management, logistics deals primarily with the materials flow component of the supply chain, and logistics managers are responsible for fulfilling customer orders while simultaneously controlling distribution costs from a total cost perspective. Students pursuing a supply chain major will develop theoretical, analytical, and software skills designed to prepare them for careers in a variety of fields. International Business responds to the global interest in international economic systems and their multicultural characteristics. This degree combines the college-required courses with International Business courses and provides students the opportunity to apply a specified upper level foreign language course toward this specialization's requirements. It is strongly recommended that this program be declared in combination with another major in or outside of business in order to assure that graduates will have specialized career focus.

Nickels (Assoc Prof Emeritus) The Major The goal of marketing is to satisfy all the stakeholders of the firm - employees, dealers, stockholders, and customers - by seeing that quality goods and services are developed and provided at fair prices and in a way that benefits the community and society. World-class competition has forced businesses to develop marketing programs that are as good as the best. This means getting closer to the customer, joining other organizations to create value for the consumer, and designing integrated distribution and communication programs that provide a seamless flow from producers to consumers. Pricing, communication/promotion, product/service, and distribution activities inherent in the development of marketing programs are applicable to non-profit organizations, business-to-business organizations, and firms that sell to ultimate consumers. Many types of careers are available to the marketing major. These include, but are not limited to: sales, advertising, retailing, product/service management, and marketing research. Because of the many different employment opportunities in marketing, many marketing electives are offered along with three core courses required of all marketing majors - consumer analysis, marketing research, and marketing strategy. Admission to the Major See Robert H. Smith School of Business entry in chapter 6 for admission requirements.

Students must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 and completion of all degree requirements to graduate. Students are encouraged to visit the Department webpage for a curriculum guideline. A multi-year academic plan will be developed in conjunction with their advisor. All Materials Science and Engineering students must be mentored by a faculty member four times generally during their sophomore and junior years (once per semester) to assist them in choosing their specialization area and to plan for post graduation. Requirements for the Minor The Department coordinates an interdisciplinary minor in Nanoscale Science and Technology through The Maryland NanoCenter . Explosive growth in the field of nanometer scale science and technology (NS&T) has led in the past few years to many technological advances in devices and materials structured at the nanometer scale. The Interdisciplinary Minor Program of Study in Nanoscience and Technology at the University of Maryland is intended to prepare participating University of Maryland students for a career in this rapidly developing field. This program draws upon the considerable expertise in nanoscience at Maryland , in departments distributed between two schools: Engineering, and Computer, Mathematics and Natural Sciences. Students take courses in Fabrication/Synthesis and Characterization, which emphasize the experimental side of NS&T, as well as Fundamental Science and Specialization Electives, which teach the underlying principles and directions, and include underlying theory and the motivations for NS&T. The minor is open to any student majoring in Engineering, Physics or Chemistry. Completion of the program instills in students the broad perspective needed for nano, including understanding and experience in fabrication/synthesis of nanomaterials and structures, their characterization/measurement, the fundamental science underlying them, and their applications.

Macasieb (Visit Asst Prof) The Major The program in mathematics leads to a degree of Bachelor of Science in mathematics and offers students training in preparation for graduate work, teaching, and positions in government or industry. Mathematical training is integrated with computer use in several courses. Because a strong mathematical background is important in many fields, over half of UMCP mathematics majors are double majors. Additional information on these topics and mathematics is available from the departmental website. Program Objectives The Department of Mathematics educates its majors in a broad range of modern mathematics while instilling in them a strong ability to solve problems, apply mathematics to other areas, and create rigorous mathematical arguments. The program prepares the majors to further their mathematical education in graduate school, or to teach at the secondary school level, or to work in government or business. Program Learning Outcomes 1. Students will acquire problem-solving skills in a broad range of significant mathematics. 2. Students will gain an understanding of what constitutes mathematical thinking, including the ability to produce and judge the validity of rigorous mathematical arguments. 3. Students will be able to communicate mathematical ideas and arguments. 4. Students will be prepared to use mathematics in their future endeavors, not only in the discipline of mathematics, but also in other disciplines. Academic Programs and Departmental Facilities Combined B.S./M.A. Program in Mathematics The Department of Mathematics offers a combined B.S./M.A. degree program for students with exceptional ability and interest in mathematics. Students enrolled in the Combined Degree Program may count up to 9 credits of coursework taken for their undergraduate degree toward the M.A. degree as well. For further information, please consult the Mathematics Department Web Page: http://www-math.umd.edu/undergraduate/math-majors.html Placement in Courses The Department of Mathematics has a large offering to accommodate a great variety of backgrounds, interests, and abilities. The department permits students to take any course for which they have the appropriate background, regardless of formal course work. For example, students with a high school calculus course may be permitted to begin in the middle of the calculus sequence even if they do not have advanced standing. Students may obtain undergraduate credit for mathematics courses in any of the following ways: passing the appropriate CEEB Advanced Placement Examination, passing standardized CLEP examinations and through the department's Credit-by-Examination. Students are urged to consult with advisors from the Department of Mathematics to assist with proper placements. Statistics and Probability and Applied Mathematics Courses in statistics and probability and applied mathematics are offered by the Department of Mathematics. These courses are open to non-majors as well as majors, and carry credit in mathematics. Students wishing to concentrate in the above may do so by choosing an appropriate program under the Department of Mathematics. Requirements for the Major There are three tracks for the major: the traditional track, the secondary education track, and the statistics track. The secondary education track is for students seeking to become certified to teach mathematics at the secondary level. Each mathematics major must complete each required course with a grade of C- or better. 7.

Other Requirements for the Major Areas of Study Within the Department of Mathematics there are a number of identifiable areas which students can pursue to suit their own goals and interests. They are briefly described below. Note that they do overlap and that students need not confine themselves to one of them. 1. Pure mathematics: Courses that belong to this area include: MATH 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 410, 411, 430, 432, 436, 437, 445, 452, 456, and STAT 410, 420. Students preparing for graduate school in mathematics should include MATH 403, 405, 410, 411 (or 412) and 463 (or 660) in their programs. MATH 432 (or 730) is also desirable. Other courses from the above list and graduate courses are also appropriate. 2. Secondary teaching: In addition to the courses required by the Secondary Education Track, the following courses are particularly suited for students preparing to teach: MATH 401, 406, 445, 470 and 475. Students who are interested in secondary teaching should contact also the College of Education for certification requirements and other information: www.education.umd.edu/studentinfo. 3. Statistics: For a student with a Bachelor's degree seeking work requiring some statistical background, the minimal program is STAT 400-401. To work primarily as a statistician, one should combine STAT 400-401 with STAT 430 and at least one more statistics course, most suitably, STAT 440. A deeper sequence is STAT 410, 420, 430. This offers a better understanding and wider knowledge of statistics and is a general purpose program (i.e., does not specify one area of application). For economics applications, MATH 424, STAT 400, 401, 430, 440 should be considered. To prepare for graduate work, STAT 410 and 420 give the best background, with STAT 430, 440 added at some later stage. 4. Computational mathematics: There are a number of math courses which emphasize the computational aspects of mathematics including the use of the computer. They are AMSC 460, 466, MATH 431, 456, 475 and STAT 430. Students interested in this area should take the CMSC supporting sequence as soon as possible. 5. Applied mathematics: The courses that lead most rapidly to applications are the courses listed above in 3 and 4 and MATH 401, 412, 414, 416, 420, 452, 462, and 464. A student interested in applied mathematics should obtain, in addition to a solid training in mathematics, a good knowledge of at least one area in which mathematics is currently being applied. Concentration in this area is good preparation for employment in government and industry or for graduate study in applied mathematics. Requirements for the Minor The Department of Mathematics offers Minors in the following areas: Actuarial Mathematics Mathematics Statistics A Minor offers a structured program of study outside a student's major. See www.math.umd.edu/undergraduate/opportunities for detailed information. Advising Advising for math majors is mandatory. Students are required to sign up for an advising appointment online, beginning the week before early registration. Students who have been away more than two years may find that due to curriculum changes the courses they have taken may no longer be adequate preparation for the courses required to complete the major. Students in this situation must meet with the Department Advisor to make appropriate plans. Undergraduate Research Experiences There are a variety of undergraduate research opportunities in mathematics at Maryland. For detailed information, see http://www-math.umd.edu/undergraduate/opportunities.html?id=102 Honors Program The Mathematics Honors Program is designed for students showing exceptional ability and interest in mathematics. Its aim is to give a student the best possible mathematics education. A precise statement of the requirements may be found at http://www-math.umd.edu/departmental-honors.html The department also offers a special department honors sequence MATH 340-341 for promising freshmen with a strong mathematical background (including calculus). Participants in Honors College may also enroll in special honors sections of the lower-level mathematics courses (MATH 140H, 141H, 240H, 241H, 246H). Students in Math 340-341 and the special honors sections need not be math majors. The mathematics departmental honors sequence and the Honors College program are distinct, and enrollment in one does not imply acceptance in the other. Student Societies and Professional Organizations 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 412There are several student-run groups within the department: the Math Club, Pi Mu Epsilon, and Women in Math.

Mattingly Professors Emeriti: J. Brown, C. Cherniak, R. Martin, S. Odell, F. Suppe The Major The study of philosophy develops students' reasoning and expository skills and increases their understanding of the foundations of human knowledge and value. The department views philosophy as an activity rather than a body of doctrine and students can expect to receive training in clear thinking, inventive synthesis, and precise expression. For some, this will serve as preparation for graduate studies in philosophy. However, philosophical skills are useful in professions such as law, medicine, government, business management, and in any field that demands intellectual rigor. The department offers a wide range of courses, including several that deal with the philosophy of various disciplines outside philosophy itself. Program Objectives All philosophy programs aim to: (1) equip students with an understanding of a range of philosophers and philosophical problems, while encouraging as deep a critical engagement with those philosophers and problems as is feasible in the time available; (2) promote respect for the norms of: clarity; careful analysis; critical reflection; rational argument; sympathetic interpretation and understanding; and impartial pursuit of truth; (3) promote independence of thought and a critical and analytical approach, not only to theories and concepts, but also to the assumptions on which they are based; (4) equip students with the core skills involved in: careful reading, comprehension and compression of textual material; clear thinking; sound argumentation; and the clear and well-organized expression of ideas; (5) provide excellent teaching which is informed and invigorated by the research activities of faculty; (6) facilitate an awareness of the application of philosophical thought to other academic disciplines or to matters of public interest, encouraging students to apply philosophical skills more widely where appropriate. Program Learning Outcomes 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 429Program Learning Outcomes By the end of the program of study: Students should be competent in formal techniques, including, but not limited to, formal logic.1. Students should be able to present critically, yet sympathetically, philosophical views that differ from their own.2. Students should be able to write clearly and in an organized fashion (appropriate to the content and context, and appropriate for a graduating major).3. Students should be able to make out a reasoned case in support of their views (appropriate to the content and context, and appropriate for a graduating major).4. Requirements for the Major The requirements for a major in Philosophy are as follows: A total of at least 36 hours (twelve courses) in philosophy, not counting internship courses (PHIL 386). For a course to count toward a student's major, the grade in the course must be C- or above. For students who matriculated in September 2012 or later, the average of all grades counted toward the major must be 2.0 or greater. Therefore, grades of C- will have to be balanced with higher grades. (C- counts as 1.7 toward the GPA.) The twelve philosophy courses must be distributed as follows: at least six courses numbered 300 or above, of which at least two must be numbered 400 or above at least one course in logic at any level at least two courses numbered 200 or above in the history of pre-twentieth century philosophy at least two courses numbered 200 or above in value theory (including aesthetics and political philosophy as well as ethics) at least two courses numbered 200 or above in metaphysics or epistemology (including philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of religion, as well as metaphysics and theory of knowledge) Supporting Courses 15 credits Fifteen hours in a supporting area; the courses do not all have to be in the same department, but they should reflect a coherent program of study. The supporting area must be chosen in consultation with a departmental advisor. For further information, students should consult the undergraduate handbook on the philosophy department's website. Requirements for the Minor Requirements for the Minor A total of at least 18 hours (six courses, at least three of which must be at least 300 level or above) in philosophy, not counting internship courses (PHIL 386). For a course to count toward a student's minor, the grade in the course must be C- or above. For students who matriculated in Septmeber 2012 or later, the average of all grades counted toward the minor must be 2.0 or greater. Therefore, grades of C- will have to be balanced with higher grades. (C- counts as 1.7 toward the GPA.) Candidates for the minor must satisfy the following distribution: at least one course numbered 200 or above in the history of pre-twentieth century philosophy at least one course numbered 200 or above in value theory (including aesthetics and political philosophy as well as ethics) at least one course numbered 200 or above in metaphysics or epistemology (including philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of religion, as well as metaphysics and theory of knowledge) Advising Philosophy Majors must be advised each semester before registration. Scholarships and Financial Assistance The W.E. Schlaretzki Prize is given to the most outstanding graduating senior each year. The Joseph and Beth Duckett Scholarship is given to the most outstanding junior. Awards and Recognition See scholarship section Physical Education The Physical Education major has been suspended and currently is not accepting students to the program.

Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 430PHYSICAL SCIENCES PROGRAM (PSCI) College of Computer, Mathematical, & Physical Sciences 1120 John S. Toll Physics Building, 301-405-5979 umdphysics.umd.edu/academics/physicalsciencesprogram.html ugrad@physics.umd.edu Chair: T. Einstein (Prof) The Major The role of the Physical Sciences Program (PSCI) is to develop skills in the areas of analytic thinking, problem solving, understanding systems, and multidisciplinary perspectives. In a world of increasing technical complexity, knowledge of the physical sciences helps individuals to evaluate scientific claims and to make informed decisions about industrial and medical technology, environmental concerns, intellectual property, etc. The Program helps prepare students for a variety of careers requiring a broad scientific background, including meteorology, earth sciences, scientific computation, science writing/journalism, patent law, military/industrial leadership, technical sales, and public policy. The Physical Sciences Program consists of a basic set of courses in physics, chemistry and mathematics, followed by a variety of courses chosen from these and related disciplines: astronomy, geology, meteorology, computer science, and the engineering disciplines. Emphasis is placed on a broad program as contrasted with a specialized one. Students are advised by members of the Physical Sciences Committee. This committee is composed of faculty members from each of the represented disciplines. The selection of a primary advisor depends upon the interest of the students. Usually the student will choose to work with one of the committee members representing the discipline the student has selected as the primary area of concentration to satisfy the distributive requirements of the program. Two secondary area advisors are also required. Program Learning Outcomes Students are expected to fully engage with the curriculum and the opportunities presented for learning and research. Having completed the degree program, students should have acquired the following knowledge and skills: Analytic thinking and problem solving skills in a variety of areas of the Physical Sciences. Advanced levels of knowledge in three areas of concentration within the Physical Sciences. Preparation to enter the workforce in careers that require a broad scientific background. Admission to the Major The Physical Sciences Program is not a Limited Enrollment Program. However, students must submit a program application and have it approved by the Physical Sciences Program Committee prior to graduating. The Committee is made up of the following faculty and staff: Astronomy: G. Deming Chemistry: M. Montague-Smith Computer Science: B. Adams Geology: J. Merck N. Hollywood Mathematics: I. Chan Einstein Advisor: T. Gleason Advisor: S. Shukla Approval of Program Plans All students must submit a program plan outlining what courses they plan to take to complete their program. These should include both the core courses and the distributive 300-400 level courses of 24 credits beyond the core. In preparing such a program plan, students should keep in mind that the Physical Sciences Committee will look for courses that will support the purpose or goals of the program. These plans should be submitted as early as possible, normally no later than the beginning of the junior year. This is important because it will provide students with sufficient time to plan an appropriate program. The program plans will be approved by the Physical Sciences Committee and filed in the Dean's Office. Any changes to the plan must be approved in writing by the student's advisor and the Chairperson. Students planning to use any of the special topics, or special programs topics courses (including PHYS 318) as part of their Physical Sciences requirement must obtain written approval to do so. Many of these special topics courses are intended for non-science students and are not suitable for Physical Sciences majors. In preparing a program plan, students should keep in mind that certain other courses are also not considered suitable for a Physical Sciences major. In particular, courses at lower levels than the core courses designed primarily for non-sciences students may be disallowed. Contact the Program Advisor for specific details. Requirements for the Major The curriculum of the Physical Sciences Program has a high degree of flexibility to allow selection of courses to meet the interests and goals of the individual student. To earn a Bachelor of Science degree in the Physical Sciences Program, a student must satisfactorily complete the following requirements: 1. Basic Requirements . Courses are required in four foundational disciplines. a. Chemistry: CHEM 135 and CHEM 132 or 136 (4 credits) b. Mathematics: MATH 140, 141 and one other math course for which MATH 141 is a prerequisite (11 or 12 credits) c. Physics: PHYS 161, 260, 261, 270, 271 (11 credits) or PHYS 171, 174, 272, 273, 275, 276 (14 credits). Students desiring a strong background in physics should take the 171-276 sequence, which is required of physics majors and offers much smaller classes than the 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 431161-271 sequence. d. Computer Science: CMSC 106, CMSC122, or CMSC 131, or PHYS 165, or ENEE 114, or ENEE 240, or ENEE 241. Students who are taking Computer Science as an area of concentration must also complete: CMSC 114 or 132, CMSC 214 or 212, and CMSC 250. e. Science/Technical Elective (3 or 4 credits): See undergraduate advisor for details 2. Distributive Requirements. Beyond the basic courses, students complete 24 upper level (300-400) distributive credits. All students must complete 18 of the 24 distributive credits as physical sciences majors. The distributive credits must be divided among three areas of concentration with at least 6 credits in each area. The areas of concentration include the disciplines of chemistry, physics, mathematics (including statistics), astronomy, geology, meteorology, computer science or one of the engineering disciplines. Students who wish to select electrical engineering need the permission of the Assistant Dean in the College of Engineering. 3. General Major Requirements. Programs in the Physical Sciences are usually sequential in nature, and students must be careful to satisfy prerequisites in all cases. Students are advised to develop a physical sciences curriculum with the help of the Physical Sciences advisors as soon as possible, but preferably by the end of the sophomore year. All Physical Science students must have a planned program of study approved by the Physical Sciences Committee. In no case shall the committee approve a program which has less than 18 credits in the three distributive areas of the Physical Sciences program to be completed, at the time the program is submitted. A grade of C- or better must be earned in all program courses (basic prerequisite and distributive requirement courses). 4. General Education . The requirements of the general education program are described in Chapter 5 of this catalog. 5. Elective Requirements. In addition to meeting the requirements stated above, each physical sciences student must plan a sufficient number of elective courses to meet the minimum 120 credits needed for graduation. Engineering courses used for one of the options must all be from the same department, e.g., all must be ENG courses or a student may use a combination of courses in ENNU and ENMA, which are both offered by the Department of Materials and Nuclear Engineering; courses offered as engineering sciences, ENES, will be considered as a department for these purposes. Selection of ENEE courses is by Permission Only. Certain courses offered in the fields included in the program are not suitable for Physical Science majors and cannot count as part of the requirements of the program. These include any courses corresponding to a lower level than the basic courses specified above (e.g. MATH 115), some of the special topics courses designed for non-science students, as well as other courses. See department for a list of excluded courses. Other Requirements for the Major Students must complete all courses required for the major with a grade of C- or higher. Advising Advising for undergraduates is available throughout the year in Room 1120 PHY. Students should also consult with the committee members for their areas of concentration. For early registration, advising is mandatory; students should check Testudo for their early registration date and should sign up for an appointment at https://advapp.physics.umd.edu. Students who have been away more than two years may find that due to curriculum changes the courses they have taken may no longer be adequate preparation for the courses required to complete the major. Students in this situation must meet with the Program Advisor to make appropriate plans. Honors Program The Physical Sciences Honors Program offers students the opportunity for research and independent study, and will lead to a BS degree with Honors or High Honors. The requirements are: a) Overall grade point average of 3.0 or better. b) Physical Sciences courses grade point average of 3.2 or better. c) An independent study course in the Physical Sciences Program - three credit minimum which may be distributed over two semesters (e.g. Astronomy 399 or 498, Chemistry 399, Computer Science 498, Geology 499, Mathematics 498, Meteorology 499 and Physics 399 or 499B). d) An honors thesis summarizing independent research submitted to the Physical Sciences Committee. e) An oral examination concerning thesis and related subjects. The thesis advisor and two other faculty members (at least one a member of the Physical Sciences Committee) will comprise the examining committee.

Physicists make important discoveries that often change the way we live by examining the way things work, and there are still many discoveries to be made. At Maryland, physics majors benefit from small class-sizes, outstanding teachers and very talented classmates. However, we believe that the most important physics education occurs outside the classroom, and we encourage all of our majors to participate in cutting-edge research with our internationally recognized faculty. Through participation in research projects, our students learn what it takes to conduct world-class scientific research. Whether students decide to continue to study physics in graduate school or work in fields such as engineering, software development, law, business or education, a bachelor's degree in physics from Maryland provides an excellent foundation. Students majoring in Physics can follow either the Professional Physics area of concentration, the Meteorology Physics area of concentration, or the Education Physics area of concentration. Program Learning Outcomes Students are expected to fully engage with the curriculum and the opportunities presented for learning and research. Having completed the degree program, students should have acquired the following knowledge and skills: A thorough knowledge of the core areas of physics, including mechanics, electricity and magnetism, thermal physics, and quantum mechanics at a level compatible with admission to graduate programs in physics at peer institutions.1. The ability to analyze and interpret quantitative results, both in the core areas of physics and in complex problems that cross multiple core areas.2. An ability to assess and solve unfamiliar problems in physics using the knowledge and skills acquired.3. The ability to use contemporary experimental apparatus common to the study of physical phenomena, and have the ability to acquire, analyze and interpret scientific data.4. The ability to communicate scientific results effectively, both verbally and in writing.5.

PHYS 401 may be replaced by PHYS 420- Principles of Modern Physics (3). PHYS 375 may be replaced by one additional non-seminar 400-level approved Physics course of 3-4 credits. Students who are considering pursuing the Education Physics area of concentration are encouraged to enroll in EDCI 280-Introduction to Teaching, for a survey of education and teaching. The Education Physics area of concentration is designed to accommodate students obtaining a teaching certificate through the College of Education. However, completing all the courses in the Education Physics area of concentration does not in itself satisfy all requirements for obtaining a teaching certificate. Students pursuing the Education Physics area of concentration who want to also obtain a teaching certificate in secondary education must first apply and be admitted to the Secondary Education Program in the College of Education and then complete additional courses in that program. For students under the CORE requirements: Students planning to double major (or seek a double degree) in Physics and Astronomy should note that this combination does not automatically satisfy CORE Advanced Studies. These students must complete CORE Advanced Studies by taking courses from departments other than Physics and Astronomy. Other Requirements for the Major Students must complete all courses required for the major with a grade of C- or higher. Requirements for the Minor This minor provides a rigorous foundation in physics for students who choose not to complete the entire physics major. The minor begins with a set of two introductory courses (6 credits) in electromagnetic fields (PHYS 262 or PHYS 272) and waves (PHYS 263 or PHYS 273). As part of this introduction to Physics, the minor also requires a one-credit introductory physics laboratory (PHYS 174, PHYS 261, or PHYS 271) involving techniques of data gathering and analysis. To obtain a deeper understanding of physics, the minor requires three additional upper-level courses (3-4 credits each), which students can select from the list below. Other upper level Physics courses can be substituted only with approval from the Department's undergraduate director and the Faculty Minor Advisor. All courses must be completed with a grade of C- or better to be counted towards the minor. No more than 7 credits in this minor can count toward major requirements. Students with more than 7 credits of overlap must substitute non-overlapping 300 or 400 level courses from the above list to reduce the overlap to no more than 7 credits. Physics majors and students majoring in Astronomy are not eligible to complete the Physics Minor due to the large number of overlapping course requirements.

Petroff The Major Plant Sciences combines basic science courses with applied technical classes to prepare students for the many and varied careers in this growing field. Students seeking a Plant Sciences degree must complete a series of requirements in one of the following Areas of Concentration: Horticulture and Crop Production, Landscape Management, Plant Science, Turf and Golf Course Management, or Urban Forestry. Horticulture and Crop Production prepares students for advisory and managerial positions in agronomic, greenhouse, nursery, orchard and vegetable crops. Students in this Area focus their studies on plant growth and development and plant protection. Landscape Management trains students for management positions in the landscape industry. The curriculum combines plant science, design and business management courses enabling graduates to meet the challenges of careers in the green industry. Plant Science is designed to prepare students for a research career. Whether students are interested in working in plant biotechnology, breeding, conservation, genomics, or plant protection, this area provides a strong foundation for postgraduate education. Turf and Golf Course Management provides the skills needed to succeed as a turfgrass professional, stressing an interdisciplinary approach to this career. Urban Forestry, a relatively new program and candidate for accreditation by the Society of American Foresters (SAF) exposes students to a wide range of skills needed for managing urban forests and seeking employment in the tree-care industry. The Department of Plant Science and Landscape Architecture also offers two additional degrees: the Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Agricultural Sciences and Technology and the Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (BLA). These programs are described elsewhere in this catalog under \"Agricultural Sciences and Technology\" and \"Landscape Architecture.\" Courses offered by this department may be found under the following acronyms: PLSC and LARC.

Requirements for the Minor Minor in Landscape Management The Landscape Management minor provides students with a foundation in plant sciences and business management. The required science courses lead to an integrative understanding of plant growth and development and the plant's responses to its environment. These courses also teach students the skills needed to recommend best management practices and to identify plant abnormalities in the landscape. The business courses in this minor foster an understanding of the business structure, human resource management and financial management associated with landscape management companies. All courses presented in this minor must be passed with a grade of C- or better. To complete this minor, students will be expected to complete an 18-19 credit course sequence. Students should also be aware that many of the courses in this minor list PLSC100, Introduction to Horticulture , as a prerequisite. Curriculum: Credits PLSC253 Woody Plants for Mid-Atlantic Landscapes I 3 PLSC254 Woody Plants for Mid-Atlantic Landscapes II 3 PLSC305 Introduction to Turf Management 3 PLSC361 Commercial Principles of Landscape Management 3 PLSC452 Environmental Horticulture 3 Select one of the following courses: AREC240 Introduction to Agriculture and the Environment 4 AREC250 Elements of Agricultural and Resource Economics 3 AREC306 Farm Management 3 BMGT220 Principles of Accounting I 3 Total Credits: A minimum of 18 or 19 credits is required to complete this minor. (Depending on which AREC or BMGT course is chosen) A student may use a maximum of six credits (or two courses) to satisfy the requirements of both a major and a minor. In the event that more than six credits of coursework listed above are required in the student's major, he or she should contact the Landscape Management faculty advisor for course substitutions. This minor is particularly relevant to students who are interested in pursuing a career in the landscape industry. Landscape architecture, environmental science and policy, and life science majors can readily complete these minor requirements within their four-year programs. Students from the business school and social sciences who are seeking managerial careers in this rapidly-expanding service industry would also find this minor to be relevant. Advising The Department has mandatory faculty advising for each of its major and minor programs. Students are required to meet with their faculty advisor at least twice a year. See the Program Management Specialist in Undergraduate Studies in 2102 Plant Sciences Building (301-405-4355) for additional information. Internships 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 440Internships with scientists are available at nearby federal and state agencies. Numerous internships also exist and can be readily arranged for students interested in private sector employment. Student Societies and Professional Organizations The department sponsors student teams that participate in regional and national contests. These teams prepare in the following areas: turf, weeds and crops, and landscape contracting. Scholarships and Financial Assistance Several scholarships and awards are available to PLSC students. Contact the Associate Dean's office at 301-405-2078 for additional information. The Department also maintains a listing of scholarships. Contact Kathy Hunt in 2102 Plant Sciences, 301-405-4355.

Patterson Hall, 301-405-7805 www.prehealth.umd.edu/ Director of Health Professions Advising Office: Wendy Loughlin Advisors in Health Professions Advising Office: Nick Celedon, Meredith Laurie The Reed-Yorke Health Professions Advising Office (HPAO), part of the College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences, serves University of Maryland students and alumni interested in pursuing careers in medicine, dentistry, or allied health fields. Advisors and staff in the HPAO provide students with pre-professional planning, including individual and group advising, career preparation workshops, admission information for pre-professional programs, a committee process to support their professional school applications, and much more. Pre-professional program advising provides the academic, and experiential foundations required for entrance into professional schools. HPAO advising encompasses the fields of medicine, dentistry, optometry, podiatry, and the allied health professions -- especially dental hygiene, nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy and physician assistant, as well as others. The pre-health professional programs at the University of Maryland are not degree granting programs. They are recommended programs of study for students interested in each profession. Students planning to pursue professional programs in medicine, dentistry, optometry, osteopathic medicine or podiatry after graduation from University of Maryland must declare an academic major by 60 credits. Students who are undecided about which academic major they will declare may enter the Letters and Sciences, but must adhere to the University of Maryland requirement that students declare a degree-granting major by the time they reach 60 credits. Pre-professional students who plan to earn a bachelor's degree should declare an academic major by 60 credits. A pre-professional student who does not declare an academic major will be designated as an undecided student in Letters and Sciences, where they will receive academic advising. Pre-professional students, including those interested in the allied health fields, may receive advising related to admission to professional school requirements through the Health Professions Advising Office, however the HPAO does not serve as a student's assigned academic advising unit. Students interested in allied health professions can in some cases transfer to such programs before earning a bachelor's degree. Such students may enter Letters and Sciences, where they will receive academic advising. The University of Maryland participates in an early assurance program with George Washington University School of Medicine. More information can be found at http://prehealth.umd.edu/premedicine/earlyassurance . Pre-Nursing 1210 HJ Patterson Hall, 301 405 7805 prehealth.umd.edu preprof@umd.edu The Pre-Nursing track prepares students for entrance into a professional curriculum for Nursing at institutions that offer Bachelor of Science in Nursing programs. Pre-Nursing is not a degree-granting program at the University of Maryland, College Park. A Baccalaureate degree program for a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.) follows a 2+2 model also known as a Traditional Baccalaureate program. Students may complete two years of prerequisite courses at the University of Maryland, College Park, and then apply for admission into a professional school to complete two years of professional course work, which includes classroom, laboratory, and clinical education. Prerequisite courses are not limited to two years and can be completed in three years. University of Maryland students also have the option of completing a four-year degree at College Park in their selected major, in addition to completing approximately twenty to twenty-five credits of nursing prerequisites. This is the Second Degree or Accelerated Second Degree model. In this model, students complete degree requirements in their chosen major, as well as the nursing prerequisites for entrance into an accelerated B.S.N. or C.N.L. program.

Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 445The undergraduate major in psychology provides an introduction to the methods by which the behavior of humans and other organisms are studied, and to the biological conditions and social factors that influence thought and behavior. The program emphasizes a strong foundation in quantitative and research methods. Students who wish to pursue graduate study in psychology or related professional schools will have opportunities to assist with and conduct research. Students who are interested in the biological aspects of behavior tend to choose a program leading to the Bachelor of Science (BS) degree, while those interested primarily in the impact of social factors on behavior tend to choose the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. The choice of program is made in consultation with an academic advisor. Courses offered by this department may be found under the acronym: PSYC. Program Objectives At the undergraduate level, students in the BA and BS programs in psychology will acquire a broad exposure to the field of psychology. They will acquire the tools and experiences necessary for future training or work in the behavioral and social sciences. These include a foundation in research methods, critical and creative problem solving skills, and the communication skills necessary to impart this knowledge to others. Students should also have developed content knowledge representing both the breadth and depth of the fields in psychology. Program Learning Outcomes The undergraduate curriculum in psychology has been designed to challenge students and to highlight the four major learning objectives that will prepare our graduates for productive roles in society. These learning objectives are consistent with the institutional goals developed in the University of Maryland Learning Outcomes and the American Psychological Association's recommendations for undergraduate programs. Research Methods in Psychology Students should understand and apply basic research methods in psychology including research design, data analysis, and interpretation. Critical Thinking Skills in Psychology Students should be able to use critical and creative thinking, skeptical inquiry, and, when possible, the scientific approach to solve problems related to behavior and mental processes. Communication Skills Students should be able to communicate effectively in a variety of formats. Content in Psychology Students should demonstrate familiarity with the questions that gave rise to content knowledge, a sampling of the major concepts, theoretical perspectives, empirical findings, and historical trends in psychology. For more information on the psychology learning outcomes, go to the department website: http://psychology.umd.edu . Academic Programs and Departmental Facilities The psychology department has state of the art research labs in five areas of psychology: clinical psychology, cognitive and neural systems, counseling psychology, developmental psychology, and social, decisional and organizational sciences. A wide variety of research opportunities are available for undergraduate students in these labs. Admission to the Major In accordance with University policy, the Department of Psychology has been designated a Limited Enrollment Program (LEP). All first-time freshman who request psychology as a major will be directly admitted into the major. Other first-time freshman who wish to declare psychology as a major prior to the last day of classes of their first semester in residence will be allowed to do so. In order to remain a psychology major, newly admitted freshman will be required to meet an academic performance review on or before the end of the semester in which they attempt 45 University of Maryland credits. This standard includes: a.

Landry, J. Lengermann, B. Meeker, M. Segal The Major Sociology is the scientific study of society and its institutions, organizations, and groups. By observing the broad range of activities in society, and exploring topics such as social class, race, gender, deviance, family, religion, the work place, and demographic trends, sociologists provide important information and perspectives on our social order and the causes and impacts of social change. Sociology provides important information useful both to personal life and public policy decisions. Sociology is among the broadest of the social sciences and is characterized by considerable pluralism in theoretical and methodological approaches, substantive specializations, and in units of analysis. Students major in Sociology for a variety of reasons. Some emphasize sociology's relevance to understanding a broad range of social issues that interest them out of intellectual curiosity, personal life relevance, or usefulness for ameliorative social change efforts. Other majors emphasize acquisition of sociological knowledge and skills useful in a variety of career paths where understanding societal problems and trends, group dynamics, and personnel issues are critical. For a small core of majors the purpose of the undergraduate program is preparation and training for admissions to graduate programs and eventual careers as sociologists in teaching and research and/or policy development. Majors may also use sociology as a basis for graduate study in related fields, including law, social work, public policy, and human resource management. Courses offered by this department may be found under the acronym: SOCY. Program Objectives The overall goals of the program are: To provide meaningful and challenging courses within the University general education program To provide meaningful and challenging courses as electives for non-majors To provide a coherent program of courses for Sociology majors which enables majors to attain: a) general sociological knowledge and understanding of our society b) sociological knowledge and skills relevant to a variety of career paths 7. Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 452c) sociological knowledge and skills relevant to application and success within competitive sociology graduate programs and career d) to provide a Sociology Honors component for selected students who have the capability and motivation to work at the most challenging level Program Learning Outcomes Having completed the degree program, students should have acquired the following knowledge and skills: To be able to think critically and assess information about society using sociological concepts and a social science mode of argument. To be confident in one's understanding of key questions addressed by the discipline and the ways in which social structure and social interaction shape human behavior. To feel competent to use research tools to conduct and assess research. To understand the role of theory in the construction of sociological inquiry; for majors this entails knowing the central ideas of major classical and contemporary theorists. To understand and be able to apply statistical concepts. To understand the social science model of evidence and argument; for majors this entails familiarity with basic social science statistical techniques, basic methods of data analysis, basic methods of organizing and presenting information, and the ability to carry out a small research project. Requirements for the Major As part of the 120 credits and other requirements for a Bachelor of Arts degree, sociology majors must complete a minimum of 38 credits in Sociology and 12 credits in supporting courses outside of Sociology. All these credits must be completed with a minimum grade of 'C-' or better in each course. The 38 credits in Sociology must include the following: Credits Required Courses Basic Requirements SOCY100 Introduction to Sociology 3 SOCY201 Introductory Statistics for Sociology 4 SOCY202Introduction to Research Methods in Sociology 4 SOCY203 Sociological Theory 3 Breadth Requirement 9 one course from three of the following concentration areas: Family and Demography: SOCY410 Social Demography SOCY443 The Family and Society Organizations and Institutions: SOCY431 Principles of Organizations SOCY443 The Family and Society SOCY460 Sociology of Work SOCY464 Military Sociology Social Psychology: SOCY230 Sociological Social Psychology SOCY430 Social Structure and Identity Stratification and Inequality: SOCY441 Social Stratification and Inequality Depth Requirement 9 At least three courses (including one required) in any one of the following concentration areas: Family and Demography: SOCY410 Social Demography (Required) SOCY411 Demographic Techniques SOCY412 Family Demography SOCY418* Research in Family and Demography SOCY442 The Family and Social Class SOCY443 The Family and Society SOCY444 Sociology of Children Organizations and Institutions: 7.

Departments, Majors, and Programs Page 454d) special topics courses (indicated with an * in the above lists) may be repeatable for credit if its content differs from when previously taken; e) SOCY498 courses may be used to fulfill depth requirements for particular concentration areas when so designated by the Undergraduate Sociology Office; the Sociology Undergraduate Office maintains current lists of special topics courses (SOCY498) that fulfill depth requirements; and f) each course counted as meeting sociology or supporting course requirements must be passed with a grade of C- or better. Other Requirements for the Major Students must earn a minimum grade of C- in MATH111 and all major requirements. Students must have a minimum 2.0 cumulative grade point average across all courses used to satisfy the major requirements. Advising Regular advising is strongly recommended for all majors. Advising is particularly important for those majors who are considering going on to graduate school. Majors are reminded of the importance of taking the four basic required courses (SOCY 100, 201, 202, 203) as soon as possible because these are prerequisites for some upper level work. Degree audits are required of all majors at 60 and 90 credits. Further information on course work, internships, the department honors program, careers, and other topics may be obtained from the Sociology Undergraduate Advisor, 2108 Art/Sociology Building, 301-405-6389. Internships Although internships are not a requirement for the major, students may wish to consider the internship program offered by the department or through the Experiential Learning unit of the University Career Center located in Hornbake Library. Majors may receive up to six credits in SOCY386 when an internship/volunteer position is combined with an academic project. A prerequisite of 12 credit hours in Sociology course work is required. Sociology internship credit does not count toward meeting requirements for the major. Honors Program The Sociology Honors Program seeks to encourage and recognize superior scholarship by providing an opportunity for interested, capable, and energetic undergraduate students to engage in study in an area of the student's interest under the close supervision of a faculty mentor. The honors program is based upon tutorial study and independent research. Students who have an overall cumulative grade point average of at least 3.3, a cumulative average of 3.5 in Sociology courses, and who have taken at least nine credits in Sociology may apply. Transfer students with equivalent academic records at other accredited institutions are also eligible. Admission to the program will be based upon academic performance and the judgment of the Undergraduate Committee whether the applicant has sufficient maturity and interest to complete successfully the requirements for graduation with Honors. Further information on the honors program is available from the Sociology Undergraduate Office. Student Societies and Professional Organizations The Sociology Collective, open to all Sociology majors, is organized by a group of interested undergraduates to fill student needs within the Sociology community. The Collective provides information about topics of interest, including department activities, career planning, and relevant changes within the university, and strives to enhance the sense of community within the department. Representatives of the Collective participate in many faculty committees within the department and thereby provide the undergraduate perspective on policy issues. Alpha Kappa Delta is the National Honor Society for Sociology majors. Membership is based on Sociology GPA (3.3 minimum) and overall GPA (3.3 minimum). Students may apply after they have completed 18 hours of Sociology course work. Application for membership may be made in the Sociology Undergraduate office and are accepted in both fall and spring semesters. Scholarships and Financial Assistance The Tara Lynn Resnick Scholarship is awarded annually to an outstanding female Sociology undergraduate student. This scholarship carries an award of $500 that may be used toward educational expenses for the following Fall semester. Applications are accepted during the Spring semester. Female students who have earned 60 credits and have a minimum GPA of 3.0 are eligible to apply. The Parker-Fuller Scholarship is awarded annually to a full-time undergraduate Sociology major in their senior year of study on the basis of need. It provides an annual award of $1,000. Applications for this scholarship are accepted during the Spring semester. The Office of Student Financial Aid (OSFA) administers all types of federal, state and institutional financial assistance programs and, in cooperation with other university offices, participates in the awarding of scholarships to deserving students.

Johnson The Major The Department of Teaching and Learning, Policy and Leadership offers undergraduate curricula in secondary education that lead to the Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Arts degree and prepares teachers in various subject areas for teaching in middle schools, secondary schools (grades 7-12), and PreK-12 settings (Art and World Languages). Multiple pathways are available for individuals who are interested in teaching at the secondary level: The Dual Major option, which is designed for incoming freshmen or sophomores, leads to the Bachelor's degree with a major in an academic content area plus a second major in secondary education. All secondary majors are required to have an academic content major which satisfies the requirements of the academic department and meets the standards for teacher certification. Candidates who follow the proposed sequencing of courses can complete both majors in four years with careful advisement and scheduling. Teaching and Learning, Policy and Leadership also offers a five-year integrated master's with certification program. See www.education.umd.edu/EDCI/info/tcert.htm. Graduates of the Secondary Education programs meet the requirements for certification in Maryland and additional states that are affiliated with the Interstate Reciprocity Agreement through the Maryland State Department of Education. Program Learning Outcomes 1. Secondary Education teacher candidates have in-depth knowledge of the subject matter that they teach as described in professional (e.g., National Council of Teachers of English - NCTE, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics - NCTM, etc.); state (MSDE); and, institutional standards. 2. Secondary Education teacher candidates can effectively plan classroom-based instruction or activities for their roles as teachers. Candidates' knowledge, skills, and dispositions are applied effectively in practice. 3. Secondary Education teacher candidates practice evidence-based decision-making through the use of assessment as well as the critical interpretation of research and inquiry in order to improve educational practice. They accurately assess and analyze student learning, make appropriate adjustments to instruction, monitor student learning, and have a positive effect on learning for all students. 4. Secondary Education teacher candidates demonstrate understanding of learners and their social and cultural contexts with a global perspective and intentional sensitivity to other cultures. They are able to work with students, families, and communities in ways that reflect the dispositions expected of professional educators as delineated in professional (e.g., NCTE, NCTM, etc.); state (MSDE); and, institutional standards. 5. Secondary Education teacher candidates competently integrate technology in instruction to support student learning and develop data-driven solutions for instructional and school improvement. They demonstrate proficiency in each of the seven Maryland Teacher Technology Standards . Academic Programs and Departmental Facilities In addition to the double major program, the Department of Teaching and Learning, Policy and Leadership offers a Five-Year Integrated Master's with Certification Program (IMCP). This program is intended for talented undergraduates with a minimum GPA of 3.0 who seek to combine undergraduate studies in the content area and professional education as a foundation for a focused professional year at the graduate level leading to secondary-level certification in the subject field and the Master's of Education degree. As undergraduates, teacher candidates are double majors in both secondary education and their content area. While double majors, undergraduates complete a minimum of 12 credits in professional education studies related to teacher certification requirements. In their junior or senior year they apply to the graduate program. If they are admitted to the graduate program they enroll in a full-year internship. These individuals will also complete graduate-level professional studies that make them eligible for initial teacher certification and the master's of education degree. Information about this secondary education program option is available at www.education.umd.edu/EDCI/info/tcert.htm. Admission to the Major Admission to the Teacher Education Professional Program is competitive. Admission procedures and criteria are explained in the College of Education entry in Chapter 6.

Rosen, L. Warren, A. Wiltz The Major The undergraduate curriculum, which leads toward a B.A. degree in Dance, offers students a solid foundation in the core areas of the discipline as well as insights into cross-disciplinary fields of study. Course work is designed to help students become skillful, articulate, expressive movers; find their own voice as creative artists; develop the ability to work effectively in a collaborative environment; and grow in their conceptual understanding of dance as an art form in relation to the other arts. The cornerstones of the curriculum are foundational course work in the first two years, and immersion in project-based learning and in a chosen area of emphasis in the junior and senior years. Foundational sequences in technique and in the creative process, which integrate conceptual understanding of dance as an art form in relation to the other arts, are at the core of the discipline. Through these fundamental practices of the discipline, students gain, not only necessary skills, but also embodied knowledge of the field. The project based learning experiences in the junior and senior years engage students in interdisciplinary and/or cross-cultural work and offer in-depth exploration of a theme from a performance, choreographic, and theory perspective. In addition, students select an area of emphasis in performance and choreography, production, or education. . The dance faculty is composed of a number of distinguished teachers, choreographers, performers, and scholars, each one a specialist in his or her own field. Visiting artists and guest artists make additional contributions to the program. There are performance and choreographic opportunities for all dance students, ranging from informal workshops to fully mounted concerts both on and off campus. Academic Programs and Departmental Facilities Dance is housed in the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center, a state-of-the-art performing arts \"village\" comprised of ten interconnected structures occupying 318,000 square feet and situated on a 17-acre site at the northwest end of the campus.

Program Learning Outcomes By the end of their undergraduate work students should be able to demonstrate fundamental knowledge of theatre performance, design, history, craft and literature analysis. They will also be able to demonstrate critical and creative thinking skills and the ability to communicate with written and spoken word and artistic vision. Students will also develop the ability to interpret and analyze dramatic texts with critical understanding of content and methodology. They will expand their awareness of the basic methods and principles for creating a dialogue between theory and practice. Finally, students will develop the ability to work effectively within a collaborative environment. Academic Programs and Departmental Facilities 7.

The department views philosophy as an activity rather than a body of doctrine and students can expect to receive training in clear thinking, inventive synthesis, and precise expression. For some, this will serve as preparation for graduate studies in philosophy. However, philosophical skills are useful in professions such as law, medicine, government, business management, and in any field that demands intellectual rigor. The department offers a wide range of courses, including several that deal with the philosophy of various disciplines outside philosophy itself. The requirements for a minor in Philosophy are as follows: A total of at least 18 hours (six courses, at least three of which must be at least 300 level or above) in philosophy, not counting internship course (PHIL 386). For a course to count toward a student's minor, the grade in the course must be C- or above. For students who matriculated in Septmeber 2012 or later, the average of all grades counted toward the minor must be 2.0 or greater. Therefore, grades of C- will have to be balanced with higher grades. (C- counts as 1.7 toward the GPA) Candidates for the minor must satisfy the following distribution: at least one course numbered 200 or above in the history of pre-twentieth century philosophy at least one course numbered 200 or above in value theory (including aesthetics and political philosophy as well as ethics) at least one course numbered 200 or above in metaphysics or epistemology (including philosophy of 8.

The minor in Religious Studies draws from a wide range of departments and programs (including Anthropology, Art History, Classics, English, History, Jewish Studies, and Philosophy) and offers the opportunity for both in-depth and wide-ranging study. A required core course, RELS 216, introduces students to religions of the world and to the academic study of religion. (In place of this course students may take RELS 289I.) In addition to this course, students are required to take three courses at the upper level and another two at any level. Completion of coursework includes fulfillment of a breadth requirement, which demonstrates that students have been exposed to a variety of religious traditions, periods, and geographic regions. Selection of courses in consultation with the advisor will ensure that students complete this breadth requirement. Many courses are now offered with the RELS prefix. Other regularly-offered courses that may be counted toward the minor are: ARTH 200, ARTH 201, ARTH 262, ENGL 263, ENGL 277, ENGL 477, GERM 283, GERM 287, many courses in JWST and HONR. Other courses may be taken with the permission of the minor advisor. Requirements: RELS 216 or RELS 289I: Introduction to the Study of World Religions. Three courses at the 300-level or above. These courses can be in any of a variety of subjects, chosen in consultation with an advisor. See Breadth requirement below. Two additional courses at any level. Chosen in consultation with an advisor. See Breadth requirement. 8. Minors Page 529Breadth requirement The breadth requirement ensures that students are exposed to a diversity of religious phenomena. Most Religious Studies students will complete this requirement simply by selecting from the wide variety of courses available to them. Students with particular interests (in a single approach, like Art History, or a single setting, like contemporary North America) will need to take at least one course that falls outside their particular focus of interest. Students will need to demonstrate: A. Exposure to a diversity of religious traditions (understood to include African religions, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism, among others), in coursework that extends beyond a single geographic area (such as the Americas, Asia, or the Mediterranean world). B. Exposure to diverse temporal periods (including antiquity, the medieval and early modern periods, and modernity). C. Experience of multiple approaches to religious phenomena or the study of religion (for example, art history, philosophy, historical approaches, and comparative methods). D. Depth: At least one course must incorporate the focused study of a single religious tradition or cluster of traditions (see item A for traditions). Examples: A student with academic focus in religions of the ancient Mediterranean might complete the breadth requirement with a single course on Asian religions. A student concentrating on art historical approaches to religion might take one course in philosophy or literature. A student whose interests run to comparative and cross-cultural coursework might take a course in the focused study of a single tradition. A minimum of 9 credits must be at the upper level. All courses must be passed with a grade of \"C-\" or above. An overall GPA of 2.0 in the minor is required for graduation. A list of qualifying courses is available from the advisor to the RELS program. At least six credits of upper-level credit must be taken at the University of Maryland . No more than six credits may be taken at an institution other than Maryland . In keeping with University policy, no more than six credits may also be applied to a major.

Students in the program will explore the theoretical foundations of survey design and survey data collection, together with the practical application of this theoretical material. Completion of the minor will prepare students to enter careers in the Federal statistical system or any of the numerous private sector firms that collect survey data to inform decision-making, as well as for further graduate study in the field of survey methodology. In addition, students aspiring to careers in fields such as marketing, political consulting, economics or the social sciences that rest on the collection and use of survey data will benefit from the understanding of the data collection process that they will acquire. Student Learning Outcomes Whether collecting information from survey respondents or making use of data collected by means of such 8. Minors Page 537surveys, individuals in many fields require an understanding of the process of designing surveys and collecting survey data. Requisite knowledge areas include the principles of questionnaire design, selecting survey samples to represent populations of interest, modes of data collection, and the use of weights in the analysis of survey data, among other topics. Upon completion of the proposed curriculum, students will: Have the knowledge needed to construct a new survey questionnaire or evaluate an existing survey questionnaire in accord with the basic principles of questionnaire design; Know how to identify potential sources of error in survey estimates and suggest strategies for minimizing those errors; and Be aware of various features of the design of sample surveys that may affect the analysis and interpretation of the resulting data. 18 credits are required for the minor as outlined below: Statistics and Research Methods Courses (6 to 8 credits) The design of survey samples and the analysis of survey data are inherently quantitative exercises. It is, therefore, important that anyone seeking to work in these fields of endeavor have a solid quantitative background. Students enrolled in the minor will be required to take two courses in statistics and research methods. Any of the following courses are appropriate choices for the first of these two courses: BIOM 301 Introduction to Biometrics CCJS 200 Statistics for Criminology and Criminal Justice ECON 321 Economic Statistics EDMS 451 Introduction to Educational Statistics GVPT422 Quantitative Political Analysis PSYC 200 Statistical Methods in Psychology SOCY 201 Introductory Statistics for Sociology STAT 400 Applied Probability and Statistics I STAT 410 Introduction to Probability Theory Any of the following courses are appropriate choices for the second of the two courses: ECON 422 Econometrics SOCY 401 Intermediate Statistics for Sociologists STAT 401 Applied Probability and Statistics II STAT 420 Introduction to Statistics There is enormous demand on campus for many of the courses listed as options for fulfilling the statistics/research methods requirement, especially the courses on the first list, and the number of seats available in these classes may be limited. Majors in the department that offers a course may receive priority for enrollment (e.g., CCJS 200) or enrollment in a course may be restricted to majors (e.g., ECON 321). In addition, there may be prerequisites associated with a particular course. Several of the courses listed in the first set of options require that the student have taken calculus and some of the courses listed in the second set of options require a particular first course as a prerequisite (e.g., STAT 420 requires STAT 410 as a prerequisite). The fact that a course is listed as an appropriate option for fulfilling the minor requirements does not imply that students necessarily will be able to enroll in that specific course. Students interested in the minor will be asked to consult with their JPSM Advisor about the best way to complete the two course statistics and research methods requirement given their individual circumstances. Courses covering similar material, including courses offered at other institutions, may be accepted as substitutes for the listed courses. SOCY 201 and SOCY 401 are 4-credit rather than 3-credit courses. For students choosing these courses to fulfill the requirements of the minor, the minor will be an 18 credit program. Students admitted to the minor in the spring of their sophomore year who have not yet taken one of the listed statistics/research methods courses ideally will take one in the fall of their junior year and the second in the spring of their junior year. Core Course in Survey Methodology (3 credits) The core course of the minor is SURV 400 Fundamentals of Survey Design. This is an existing course that is offered each spring and is taught by a regular member of the JPSM teaching faculty. Students in the minor will be given enrollment priority. SURV 400 is designed to provide students with an overview of the entire survey process, from the development of survey objectives to the collection and analysis of the survey data. 8. Minors Page 538survey process, from the development of survey objectives to the collection and analysis of the survey data. The textbook for the course was authored by leading scholars in the field, all of whom have taught in the JPSM program. SURV 400 will be a prerequisite for the two additional 3 credit SURV courses required for the minor and should be taken in the spring of the junior year. Additional Survey Methodology Courses (6 credits) Students completing the minor also will be required to take SURV 430 Questionnaire Design, a new course developed to serve students in the minor as well as graduate students in other departments on campus. SURV 430 will be offered as a stand-alone course each year in the fall semester and students in the minor will be given enrollment priority. We do not currently have the staff resources to offer a separate section of this new class in other semesters. In order to provide students completing the minor with needed scheduling flexibility, SURV 430 will be offered jointly with SURV 630, an existing course taken by students pursuing the JPSM Masters in Survey Methodology, in the spring and/or summer. Qualified students enrolled in the jointly offered SURV 430/SURV 630 course may choose, with permission, to register for SURV 630. Successful completion of SURV 630 will satisfy the minor requirement. Taking SURV 630 could be advantageous for students who later apply for the JPSM Masters degree program, as it is a required course for that program. Students taking the minor also will be required to take one additional 600-leve1 SURV course. The course options and the semesters when these courses are regularly offered are as follows: SURV 623 Data Collection - Fall, Summer SURV 632 Social and Cognitive Foundations of Survey Measurement - Fall SURV 625 Applied Sampling - Spring, Summer These are existing courses taken primarily by students in the JPSM Masters program. Although these are graduate level courses, we believe they should be accessible to advanced undergraduates with suitable preparation. Seminar (1 credit) The final requirement for the minor is that students participate in SURV 672 Introduction to the Federal Statistical System and to the Survey Research Profession, another course taken by students in the JPSM Masters program. This is a one-credit pass-fail seminar, taught each fall, in which students consider issues related to the ethics of survey data collection and serving the users of survey data. During the semester, students meet with the heads of a number of the federal statistical agencies, giving them the opportunity to learn about those agencies' work. This seminar is an important part of the professionalization of our students and thus of preparing them for careers that make use of their survey methodology background. Completion Requirements In order to complete the minor, students must: Complete all 16-18 required credits; Achieve a minimum grade of \"C-\" or better in all minor courses; Students must have a minum 2.0 cumulative grade point average across all courses used to satisfy the minor requirements; Apply no more than two courses from the minor to satisfying the requirements of the student's major; Complete no more than two courses for the minor at an institution other than the University of Maryland, College Park. The minor is designed to be completed during the junior and senior years, but students could apply for admission to the minor as early as the fall of their sophomore year. Courses completed prior to applying for the minor will be accepted to satisfy the minor requirements. Eligibility and Application Process Admission to the minor will be limited to no more than 25 students per year, selected through a competitive application process. This limitation on potential enrollments is necessary because of the small size of the JPSM faculty. Successful applicants will have completed at least 30 semester credits and have demonstrated a high level of academic achievement with a minimal GPA requirement of a 3.2. Students who apply to the program are expected to be able to work independently. Students seeking admission to the minor will be asked to complete an application form made available on the JPSM website, submit a letter of support for their application from a faculty member or advisor, submit a half page statement why this minor interests you 8. Minors Page 539and provide a copy of their transcript. The faculty committee responsible for oversight of the minor will evaluate the applications submitted. In selecting students to the program the committee will emphasize academic achievement including, in particular, evidence of successful completion of courses in quantitative subjects. Advising Interested students should contact JPSM at JPSM@survey.umd.edu . The application form will be posted to the JPSM website at www.jpsm.org and applications for admission will be reviewed each semester. Once admitted to the program, students will work with the program director or an assigned faculty advisor to plan the courses to be taken to complete the minor. Students will be expected to be in touch with their faculty advisor(s) prior to the start of each semester to ensure that they are continuing on track to complete the minor requirements. Sustainability Studies Co-sponsored by the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources and the School of Public Policy http://publicpolicy.umd.edu/sust susminor@umd.edu 1118C Taliaferro The study of sustainability examines each generation's commitment to protect and preserve the quality of the natural environment for the benefit of succeeding generations. The stability of natural systems and the environment, economic progress, and promoting social justice are all important sustainability goals. Promoting these goals involves choices among competing ends. The Sustainability Studies Minor at the University of Maryland provides students the opportunity to learn how human relationships, natural resources, and diverse environments can be understood and used to address creatively and positively the global challenges that will affect future human populations and cultures. It will complement any major on campus and provide both intellectual breadth and depth in a challenging area of inquiry that is gaining a high level of interest in businesses, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations. Together with a major in a discipline, this minor will provide students with the critical thinking and problem-solving skills necessary for them as citizens, employees, or graduate students. Requirements: 15 approved credits, at least 9 of which are 300- or 400-level. All courses taken for a minor must be completed with a minimum grade of C-. A minimum C (2.00) cumulative grade point average across all courses used to satisfy the minor is also required. Notes: No more than 6 credits may overlap between your major and Sustainability Studies, unless otherwise approved by your major. Additionally, courses completed in one minor may not be used to satisfy the requirements in another minor. 3 credits - AGNR/PUAF301 - Introduction to Sustainability (required). This course will introduce you to the normative concepts and new thinking surrounding sustainability. We will use readings, lectures, writing exercises, and small group exercises that address how environmental responsibility, economic health, social equity, and cultural vitality are defined and considered in the sustainability context. The roles of resilience and adaptive management will be examined as key pragmatic dimensions of sustainability and as challenging concepts shaping our environmental ethics today. Guest speakers from the Washington region with research and policy expertise will discuss current policy issues. 9 credits - One course from each of three groups of courses linked to the three pillars of sustainability (see Web site for approved courses). 3 credits - A fourth course from one of these lists -or- an approved, credit-bearing experiential learning option for which a grade is earned , e.g., internship, study abroad, research project, etc. The experiential learning option must be linked to sustainability and approved in advance. 8.

All students enrolled at the University of Maryland, College Park or at a Maryland community college program articulated with the terminated degree program during the semester in which the program is terminated must complete the major requirements of the terminated degree program within five calendar years of the date upon which the program is terminated. If only a few students are enrolled in a terminated program, a shorter time limit may be imposed based on a study of the academic records of all students enrolled in the program. If a shorter time period is imposed, all students enrolled in the program will be notified of its length. 2. Students who, prior to the termination date had been enrolled in the terminated program or a Maryland community college articulated with the terminated program, but who subsequently interrupt their studies at the University of Maryland, College Park or the community college for one or more semesters will be allowed to enter or re-enter the program only if a careful analysis of their records by the appropriate dean indicates they will be able to complete the major requirements of the terminated program within the remaining time period specified. 3. When a program is terminated the University of Maryland, College Park will make a good faith effort to notify those students who had interrupted their studies in that program. As part of that good faith effort, the University of Maryland at College Park will publish in its re-enrollment forms, catalogues, and schedules of classes a statement advising returning students that programs may have been terminated and that the student needs to check the current status of the program. University Policies Page 550needs to check the current status of the program. 4. At the end of the time period specified for completion of major requirements after the termination date of the program, the relevant department or college will evaluate the records of each student enrolled in the program for fulfillment of departmental major requirements and will notify students whether they have completed these requirements. Such notice shall be in writing and sent to the student's last known addresses. 5. When a degree program is terminated, the university will send notification of the time limit for completion of the major requirements to all students enrolled in the program at that time. It will also attempt to send notification to students who interrupted their studies while enrolled in the program in the preceding three years, insofar as such students can reasonably be identified. This notification will be sent to the students' last known addresses on file with the university. Such notifications also will be sent to the Maryland community colleges having programs articulated with the terminated program. Appendix H: POLICY ON STUDENT CLASSIFICATION FOR ADMISSION AND TUITION PURPOSES VIII-2.70 The policy below is current as of this publication. For more information and possible updates go to: http://www.usmh.usmd.edu/regents/bylaws/SectionVIII/VIII270.html VIII-2.70 POLICY ON STUDENT CLASSIFICATION FOR ADMISSION AND TUITION PURPOSES (Approved by the Board of Regents August 28, 1990; Amended July 10, 1998; Amended November 27, 2000; Amended April 11, 2003; Amended June 23, 2006;Amended February 15, 2008; Amended September 18, 2009) I. POLICY A. Purpose To extend the benefits of its system of higher education while encouraging the economical use of the State's resources, 1 it is the policy of the Board of Regents of the University System of Maryland (USM) to recognize the tuition categories of in-state and out-of-state students for the purpose of admission and assessing tuition at USM institutions. B. Burden of Proof The person seeking in-state status shall have the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that he or she satisfies the requirements and standards set forth in this Policy. Assignment of in-state or out-of-state status will be made by the applicable USM institution upon a review of the totality of facts known or presented to it. C. In-state Status To qualify for in-state tuition, a student must demonstrate that, for at least twelve (12) consecutive months immediately prior to and including the last date available to register for courses in the semester/term for which the student seeks in-state tuition status, the student had the continuous intent to: 1. Make Maryland his or her permanent home; and 2. Abandon his or her former home state; and 3. Reside in Maryland indefinitely; and 4. Reside in Maryland primarily for a purpose other than that of attending an educational institution in Maryland. University Policies Page 5514. Reside in Maryland primarily for a purpose other than that of attending an educational institution in Maryland. Satisfying all of the requirements in Section II (and Section III, when applicable) of this policy demonstrates continuous intent and qualifies a student for in-state tuition. Students not entitled to in-state status under this policy shall be assigned out-of-state status for admission and tuition purposes. D. Presumption Either of the following circumstances raises a presumption that the student is residing in the State of Maryland primarily for the purpose of attending an educational institution and therefore, does not qualify for in-state status under this policy: 1. A student is attending school or living outside Maryland at the time of application for admission to a USM institution, or 2. A student is Financially Dependent on a person who is not a resident of Maryland. This presumption may be rebutted. The student bears the burden of rebutting the presumption. See \"III. Rebuttal Evidence\" below. II. REQUIREMENTS Before a request for classification to in-state status will be considered, a student must comply with all of the following requirements for a period of at least twelve (12) consecutive months immediately prior to and including the last date available to register for courses in the semester/term for which the student seeks in-state tuition status. The student must demonstrate he or she: A. Owns or possesses, and has continuously occupied, including during weekends, breaks and vacations, living quarters in Maryland. The student must provide evidence of a genuine deed or lease and documentation of rent payments made. In lieu of a deed or lease, a notarized affidavit from a landlord showing the address, name of the student as occupant, term of residence, and history of rent payments made will be considered. As an alternative, a student may demonstrate that he or she shares living quarters in Maryland which are owned or rented and occupied by a parent, legal guardian or spouse. B. Has substantially all of his or her personal property, such as household effects, furniture and pets in Maryland. C. Has paid Maryland income tax on all taxable income including all taxable income earned outside the State and has filed a Maryland tax return. D. Has registered all owned or leased motor vehicles in Maryland. E. Possesses a valid Maryland driver's license, if licensed. F. Is registered to vote in Maryland, if registered to vote. G. Receives no public assistance from a state other than the State of Maryland or from a city, county or municipal agency other than one in Maryland. H. Has a legal ability under Federal and Maryland law to live permanently without interruption in Maryland. I. Has rebutted the presumption that he or she is in Maryland primarily to attend an educational institution, if the student's circumstances have raised the presumption. III. REBUTTAL EVIDENCE Satisfying the requirements listed in paragraphs A through I of Section II, does not rebut the presumption that a student is in Maryland primarily to attend an educational institution. To overcome the presumption, a student must present additional evidence. To determine a student's intent, the University will evaluate evidence of a student's objectively verifiable conduct. Evidence that does not document a period of at least twelve (12) consecutive months immediately prior to and including the last date available to register for courses in the semester/term for which the student seeks in-state tuition status is generally considered an unfavorable factor under this policy. Evidence of intent must be clear and convincing and will be evaluated not only by the amount presented but also based upon the reliability, authenticity, credibility and relevance of the evidence. The absence of objective, relevant evidence is generally considered an unfavorable factor. A student's statement of intent to remain in Maryland in the future is generally not considered to be objective evidence under this policy. Additional evidence that will be considered includes, but is not limited to, the following: University Policies Page 552Additional evidence that will be considered includes, but is not limited to, the following: A. Source of financial support: 1. Maryland employment and earnings history through sources beyond those incident to enrollment as a student in an educational institution e.g., beyond support provided by work study, scholarships, grants, stipends, aid, student loans, etc. (Tuition costs will be considered as a student expense only to the extent tuition exceeds the amount of any educational scholarships, grants, student loans, etc.), or 2. Evidence the student is Financially Dependent upon a person who is a resident of Maryland. B. Substantial participation as a member of a professional, social, community, civic, political, athletic or religious organization in Maryland, including professionally related school activities that demonstrate a commitment to the student's community or to the State of Maryland. C. Registration as a Maryland resident with the Selective Service, if male. D. Evidence showing the student uses his or her Maryland address as his or her sole address of record for all purposes including on health and auto insurance records, bank accounts, tax records, loan and scholarship records, school records, military records, leases, etc. E. An affidavit from a person unrelated to the student that provides objective, relevant evidence of a student's conduct demonstrating the student's intent to live permanently in Maryland. IV. NON-RESIDENTS WHO MAY TEMPORARILY QUALIFY FOR IN-STATE STATUS In addition, persons with the following status shall be accorded the benefits of in-state status for the period in which they hold such status: A. A full-time or part-time (at least 50 percent time) regular employee of USM or a USM institution. B. The spouse or Financially Dependent child of a full-time or part-time (at least 50 percent time) regular employee of USM or a USM institution. C. A full-time active member of the Armed Forces of the United States whose home of residency is Maryland or one who resides or is stationed in Maryland, or the spouse or a Financially Dependent child of such a person. Students that qualify under this provision will retain in-state status for tuition purposes as long as they are Continuously Enrolled regardless of a change in military assignment or status of the active member of the military. D. A veteran of the United States Armed Forces with an honorable discharge who, within one year of discharge, presents documentation that he or she attended a secondary school in the State for at least three years, and graduated or received the equivalent of a high school diploma from a secondary school in the State. The veteran must present documentation and register at a USM institution within one year of discharge for this provision to apply. E. A member of the Maryland National Guard, as defined in the Public Safety Article of the Maryland Annotated Code, who joined or subsequently serves in the Maryland National Guard to: (i) provide a critical military occupational skill; or (ii) be a member of the Air Force Critical Specialty Code as determined by the National Guard. F. For UMUC, a full-time active member of the Armed Forces of the United States on active duty, or the spouse of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States on active duty. G. A graduate assistant appointed through a USM institution for the semester/term of the appointment. Except through prior arrangement, this benefit is available only for enrollment at the institution awarding the assistantship. V. PROCEDURES A. An initial determination of in-state status will be made at the time of admission. The determination made at that time, and any determination made thereafter, shall prevail for each semester/term until the determination is successfully challenged in a timely manner. B. A change in status must be requested by submitting a USM institution's \"Petition for Change in Classification for Tuition\". A University Policies Page 553student applying for a change to in-state status must furnish all evidence that the student wishes the USM institution to consider at the time the petition is due. The due date is based on the deadline set forth by the USM institution at which the student seeks to enroll. If the applicable USM institution has no such deadline, the due date is the last published date to register for the forthcoming semester/term for which the change in classification is sought. C. The student shall notify the USM institution in writing within fifteen (15) days of any change in circumstances which may alter in-state status. D. In the event incomplete, false, or misleading information is presented, the USM institution may, at its discretion, revoke in-state status and take disciplinary action provided for by the institution's policy. Such action may include suspension or expulsion. If in-state status is gained due to false or misleading information, the institution reserves the right to retroactively assess all out-of-state charges for each semester/term affected. E. Each USM institution shall develop and publish additional procedures to implement this Policy. Procedures shall provide that on request the institution President or designee has the authority to waive any requirement set forth in Section II if it is determined that the application of the requirements creates an unjust result. These procedures shall be filed with the Office of the Chancellor. VI. DEFINITIONS A. Financially Dependent: For the purposes of this policy, a financially dependent student is one who is claimed as a dependent for tax purposes. B. Parent: A parent may be a natural parent, or, if established by a court order recognized under the law of the State of Maryland, an adoptive parent. C. Guardian: A guardian is a person so appointed by a court order recognized under the law of the State of Maryland. D. Spouse: A spouse is a partner in a legally contracted marriage. E. Child: A child is a natural child or a child legally adopted pursuant to a court order recognized under the law of Maryland. F. Regular Employee: A regular employee is a person employed by USM or a USM institution who is assigned to a State budget line or who is otherwise eligible to enroll in a State retirement system. Examples of categories NOT considered regular employees are graduate students, contingent employees, and independent contractors. G. Continuous Enrollment: 1. Undergraduate Student - An undergraduate student who is enrolled at a USM institution for consecutive fall and spring semesters, until completion of the student's current degree program or unless on an approved leave of absence or participating in an approved program off-campus. 2. Graduate and Professional - Continuous enrollment for a graduate or professional student is defined by the institution in accordance with program requirement. VI. IMPLEMENTATION This policy as amended by the Board of Regents on September 18, 2009 shall be applied to all student tuition classification decisions made on or after July 1, 2009. 1 Annotated Code of Maryland, Education Article, \u00a712-101. Appendix I: UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE V-1.00 (A) http://www.president.umd.edu/policies/v100a.html University Policies Page 554Appendix J: UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND PROCEDURES FOR REVIEW OF ALLEGED ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS GRADING--UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS III-1.20(B) http://www.president.umd.edu/policies/iii120b.html Appendix K: POLICY ON PARTICIPATION BY STUDENTS IN CLASS EXERCISES THAT INVOLVE ANIMALS Students who are concerned about the use of animals in teaching have the responsibility to contact the instructor, prior to course enrollment, to determine whether animals are to be used in the course, whether class exercises involving animals are optional or required and what alternatives, if any, are available. If no alternatives are available, the refusal to participate in required activities involving animals may result in a failing grade in the course. Departments including courses where animals are used must actively inform students of such courses, including, but not limited to, notices in the Catalog. The University of Maryland, College Park campus, affirms the right of the faculty to determine course content and curriculum requirements. The University, however, also encourages faculty to consider offering alternatives to the use of animals in their courses. In each course, the instructor determines whether the use of animals in the classroom exercises will be a course requirement or optional activity. The following departments have courses that may require animals to be used in class activities: Animal and Avian Sciences, Cell Biology and Molecular Genetics, Psychology, Veterinary Medicine, Biology, and courses with the NFSC prefix. Committee on Academic Procedures and Standards April 27, 1990 Appendix L: COMPLETION OF INTERRUPTED DEGREE Students whose registration at the University of Maryland, College Park, has lapsed for more than 10 years shall be required to complete a minimum of 15 credit hours at College Park after their return to campus in order to earn a baccalaureate degree. Recommendations about courses needed to satisfy the remaining degree requirements will be made at the department level, with approval of the Dean's Office required. The reason for requiring these credits is that many fields change sufficiently in 10 years to require that students take current courses if they are to be awarded a current degree. Exceptions to the requirement for a minimum of 15 credits earned at College Park upon return to the campus can be recommended by the Deans for approval in the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs. College Park Senate October 1995 University Policies Page 555Appendix M: UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND POLICY ON THE COLLECTION, USE AND PROTECTION OF ID NUMBERS VI-26.00(A) The policy below is current as of this publication. For more information and possible updates go to: http://www.president.umd.edu/policies/docs/vi-2600A.pdf VI-26.00(A) UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND POLICY ON THE COLLECTION, USE AND PROTECTION OF ID NUMBERS (Approved by the President May 31, 2005) I. Purpose: The University of Maryland is dedicated to ensuring the privacy and proper handling of confidential information relating to students, faculty, staff and individuals associated with the University. Traditionally, the Social Security Number (SSN) has been used as a common \"person\" identifier and the key to University \"person\" databases. The purpose of this policy is to authorize the creation of new methods of unique identification that will replace reliance on the SSN and allow for easy identification of a person for University transactions. II. Policy Use of the SSN as an identifier will be discontinued, except where required for employment, IRS reporting, Office of Institutional Research and Planning analysis, federal student financial aid processing and a limited number of other business transactions. While the SSN will be collected and retained as authorized by law, it will not be used for routine identification or authentication purposes. Instead, a unique, nine digit university identification number called U ID Number will be assigned to each individual. For computer access, individuals will also have a unique Directory ID. For complete authentication, these identifiers (U ID Number and Directory ID) are accompanied by the use of a PIN or password. University Policies Page 556 III. Policy Implementation 1. The University of Maryland prohibits the use of a person's SSN as a publicly visible identification number for University-related transactions, unless specifically required by law or business necessity. A listing of currently approved uses is provided in Appendix A. This list is subject to change. 2. The University of Maryland will use SSN as a data element but not as a key for access to databases. 3. Each member of the University community will be assigned a unique identification number that will not be the same as nor derived from the individual's SSN. This number is called the U ID Number. 4. Software systems purchased or developed by the University of Maryland will not display a SSN either in read-only format or on print or other system output, unless authorized by law or business necessity. 5. Name and directory systems, purchased or developed by the University of Maryland, will be keyed for access by an individual's unique U ID Number, not the SSN. 6. When databases need to utilize SSN, they will use secure conversion tables or other technical mechanisms that automatically cross-reference SSN and other information within systems. In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to use SSN as an alternate search field. All such cases shall be referred to the data custodian (Registrar's Office for students, UHR for employees) who shall seek approval from the University Data Policy Advisory Committee. In addition, any transmission of data containing SSN over any communication network must be transmitted using a secure methodology. University Policies Page 557network must be transmitted using a secure methodology. 7. Systems or technology developed or purchased by the University of Maryland after the effective date of this policy shall comply with these provisions. 8. For computer access or login purposes, members of the University community will also be assigned a Directory ID. The Directory ID will be used as a standard identifier for all computer resource authentication purposes but individuals may also be allowed to authenticate by using their U ID Number. 9. Campus validation of University of Maryland photo ID cards will be by reference to either the holder's U ID Number or bar code. Timeframe for Implementation: The University of Maryland recognizes that many of its major systems are currently keyed for access to SSN as an identifier and that the conversion of all systems will take time and resources. The expectation is that there will be a steady and purposeful movement away from dependency on SSN. Appropriate interim measures may be developed until such time as the conversion to U ID Numbers is complete. \"Legacy\" Data: The University recognizes that the SSN must be retained and used as a person identifier in older \"legacy\" data pertaining to ex-students and ex-employees as it is impractical to assign U ID numbers to these individuals. Protection of ID Data Held in Secondary or Derivative Data Files: Any University office that collects and maintains an individual's social security number in any media must: 1) ensure that the number is stored in a secure and confidential environment; 2) eliminate using the number for any purpose except those specifically addressed in this policy; 3) begin a steady and purposeful movement away from its dependency on the SSN in performing its functions and processes; and 4) follow University guidelines for the retention and destruction of records containing the SSN. University Policies Page 558 Notification Requirement: Any University office that collects SSN from an individual must provide a disclosure statement approved by the Data Policy Advisory Committee. Notifications for students, employees, and affiliates/guests are provided in Appendix B. APPENDIX A Uses for Social Security Numbers (SSN) (subject to change) Employment: The SSN is required for a variety of employment matters; such as tax withholding, FICA, Medicare, etc. SSN may also be used and maintained if it is supplied by an employee as documentation when completing the Federal I-9 Employment Authorization Form. Application and Receipt of Financial Aid: Any student who applies for student aid by use of the federal Free Application For Student Assistance (FAFSA) is required to provide his SSN. Students are also required to provide SSNs when applying for student education loans. Tuition Remission: The SSN is required for state reporting of taxable tuition remission benefits received by employees, their spouses and dependents, and by graduate assistants. Veterans Administration Benefits: The SSN is required for enrollment verification and reporting on all Veterans Administration beneficiaries. IRS Reporting: The SSN is used for producing federally required 1098-T forms, which report the amount of tuition paid to the University during the tax year. Copies of these forms are mailed to students each year, and the information reported to the IRS. In addition, the University reports the value of all taxable and non-taxable scholarships and grants awarded to non-resident aliens to the IRS. University Policies Page 559to non-resident aliens to the IRS. Inter-Institutional Communication and Information Exchange: Many institutions, including postsecondary educational institutions, use the SSN as a student identifier. To ensure the accuracy of inter-institutional data exchanges (transcripts, transfer credit evaluations, USM ArtSys data base, MHEC, etc.) the SSN may be used for the exchange of information from student academic records between appropriate institutions including other colleges and universities. Tracking Name Changes of Students and Alumni: The SSN is also used internally to track name changes of students and alumni of the University. APPENDIX B REQUIRED DISCLOSURE STATEMENTS Student Notification \"Use of Social Security Number (SSN) - Students Section 15-110 of the Education Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland prohibits the use of SSN on University identification cards. Section 7(b) of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 522a) and section 10-624 of the State Government Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, also require that when any Federal, State, or local government agency requests an individual to disclose his or her Social Security Number (SSN), that individual must also be advised whether the disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, by what statutory or other authority the number is solicited, what use will be made of it, the specific consequences for failure to provide the information, whether the information is generally available for public inspection and whether the information is made available or transferred to or shared with any entity other than the University. University Policies Page 560entity other than the University. Accordingly, each applicant for admission is advised that disclosure of his or her SSN is required as a condition for making application to the University of Maryland for purposes of administering federal financial aid programs and complying with various State and Federal reporting requirements including reporting to the IRS. The University may use a student's SSN to accurately report federally required data, to generate various federal tax and financial aid reports, and to ensure the accuracy of student data that is exchanged within the University of Maryland, between post-secondary education institutions, with the University System of Maryland and other outside entities as necessary or required for the conduct of legitimate University business and consistent with applicable law. The SSN will be maintained in a secure and confidential manner and not be re-disclosed for any other purpose. The authority for requesting disclosure of a student's SSN is grounded in various federal laws including but not limited to: 42 USC 405c, affecting wage reporting and withholdings; 34 CFR 668.14 and 34 CFR 668.16, relating to student aid programs; and 26 CFR 1.6050S-1, addressing Internal Revenue Code reporting requirements pertaining to tuition payments. In addition, it should be noted that the SSN of a parent, guardian or spouse of an applicant is also requested if the student claims dependency on that person for financial aid or residency for tuition purposes. A parent, guardian or spouse is advised that disclosure of his or her SSN is necessary for the above student purpose and failure to provide it may affect the student's financial aid or tuition status. A parent's, guardian's or spouse's SSN will only be used for the purpose for which it was collected and will not be maintained in any other system of records. A unique U ID Number is assigned to students as part of their initial enrollment and is used for all University identification purposes.\" University Policies Page 561 Employee Notification \"Use of Social Security Number (SSN) - Employees Section 7(b) of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 522a) and section 10-624 of the State Government Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, requires that when any Federal, State, or local government agency requests an individual to disclose his or her social security number, that individual must also be advised whether the disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, by what statutory or other authority the number is solicited, what use will be made of it, the specific consequences for failure to provide the information, whether the information is generally available for public inspection and whether the information is made available or transferred to or shared with any entity other than the University . Accordingly, each employee is advised that disclosure of his or her SSN is required as a condition of employment at the University of Maryland in complying with State and Federal employment matters including but not limited to, the withholding and reporting of State and Federal income tax, FICA, and Medicare insurance tax. Additionally, the SSN may be used and maintained, when supplied by an employee, as documentation for completing the Federal I-9 Employment Authorization Form. The employee's SSN will be used to accurately record state and federal required data as necessary or required for the conduct of legitimate University business and consistent with applicable law. This number will be maintained in a secure and confidential manner and not be re-disclosed for any other purpose. The authority for requesting disclosure of an employee's SSN is grounded in various federal laws including but not limited to, 42 U.S.C. 405c, affecting wage reporting and withholdings. Efforts to limit the use of SSN include the issuance of a unique U ID Number that is assigned to all employees as part of their initial employment and will be used for all University identification purposes.\" University Policies Page 562University identification purposes.\" Affiliates Notification \"Use of Social Security Number (SSN) - Affiliates/Guests who receive University services and are not students, employees, or non-paid appointees. Section 7(b) of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 522a) and section 10-624 of the State Government Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, requires that when any Federal, State, or local government agency requests an individual to disclose his or her social security number, that individual must also be advised whether the disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, by what statutory or other authority the number is solicited, what use will be made of it, the specific consequences for failure to provide the information, whether the information is generally available for public inspection and whether the information is made available or transferred to or shared with any entity other than the University .
