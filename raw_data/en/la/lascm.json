SC Board of Health and Environmental Control, December 13 , 2018 - Page 2 of 7 Item 4: Public Hearing for Notice of Final Regulation -- Proposed Repeal of Regulation 61 -67.1, Requirements for State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund Loan Assist ance, Document No. 4838 , Review by General Assembly is required (Attachment 4-1) Mr. Shawn Clarke, Bureau of Water , presented this item to the Board. The Bureau propose d repeal of R.61-67.1. The regulation describes the process the Department of Health and Environmental Control (\"Department\") and the former South Carolina Budget and Control Board followed in administering the State Water Pollution Revolving Fund received in federal grants from the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"). In 1992, the Gen eral Assembly repealed S.C. Code Section 48 -6- 10 et seq. and replaced it with the South Carolina Water Quality Revolving Fund Authority Act (S.C. Code Section 48 -5-10 et seq.). Passage of the South Carolina Water Quality Revolving Fund Authority Act (\"Act\" ) has rendered R.61 -67.1 obsolete. The Act provides authority for the Department and the South Carolina Water Quality Revolving Fund Authority to administer the South Carolina clean water and drinking water revolving funds and federal grants received as su pplements to the revolving funds from the EPA. The South Carolina Water Quality Revolving Fund Authority comprises the members of the State Fiscal Accountability Authority, with administrative and implementation support from the South Carolina Rural Infras tructure Authority (\"RIA\"). In accordance with the Act, the State Water Pollution Revolving Fund (\"SRF\") authorized under the former statute (Title 48, Chapter 6) remains in existence and is now referred to as the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (\"CWSRF\"). The CWSRF, like the former State Water Pollution Revolving Fund, provides low interest loans to public utilities and local governments for wastewater and stormwater infrastructure projects. The General Assembly amended Title 48, Chapter 5 in 199 7 to include the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (\"DWSRF\"), which provides low interest loans to public utilities and local governments for public drinking water infrastructure projects. The 1987 amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Act, otherwise known as the Clean Water Act, authorized federal funding for the CWSRF and the former State Water Pollution Revolving Fund. The 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act authorized federal funding for the DWSRF. The CWSRF and DWSRF are revolving fund s because they receive repayments and interest from the loans made from the funds. Additional money comes into the funds through interest on investments and annual federal grants received from EPA. Repeal of the regulation will have no impact or implicatio ns for the current administration and implementation of the CWSRF or DWSRF. The Department does not propose replacing this regulation with a new regulation. The Department and RIA can effectively administer and implement the SRF program using the state st atute, Title 48, Chapter 5, and federal laws, regulations, and grant requirements that govern the use of the funds. Other existing state laws and regulations also are used to implement the program such as environmental permitting regulations that govern th e design and construction of wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects. Mr. Taylor opened the meeting up for public comments on this matter, but no one wished to speak. (Attachment 4-2) After discussion, Mr. Creel moved, seconded by Mr. Toomey , that based on the public hearing and documents herein, to find for the need and reasonableness of the Proposed Repeal of Regulation 61 - 67.1, Requirements for State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund Loan Assistance, Document No. 4838, and grant approval for submission to the General Assembly for review . The Board voted and Motion carried. SC Board of Health and Environmental Control, December 13 , 2018 - Page 3 of 7 A verbatim transcript of these proceedings is included as part of the official record. (Attachment 4-3) Item 5: Public Hearing for Notice of Final Re gulation - Proposed Amendment of Regulation 61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations, Document No. 4841 (Attachment 5-1) Mr. Joe Bowers, Program Manager, Bureau of Land and Waste Management, presented this item to the Board. The Bureau proposed am ending R.61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations, to adopt the Environmental Protection Agency's (\"EPA\") Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule published November 28, 2016, at 81 FR 85732 -85829. The Hazardous Waste Generator Improvements Rule reorganizes the hazardous waste generator regulations to improve their usability by the regulated community, provide a better understanding of how the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\") hazardous waste generator regulatory program works, addres s gaps in existing regulations to strengthen environmental protections, provide greater flexibility for hazardous waste generators to manage their hazardous waste in a cost -effective and protective manner, and make technical corrections to address inadvert ent errors and remove obsolete references to programs that no longer exist. Mr. Taylor opened the meeting up for public comments on this matter, but no one wished to speak. (Attachment 5 -2) Dr. Gillespie moved, seconded by Mr. Creel , that based on the p ublic hearing and documents herein, to find for the need and reasonableness of the Proposed Amendment of Regulation 61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations, Document No. 4841, and grant approval for submission to the General Assembly for review . The Board voted, and Motion carried. A verbatim transcript of these proceedings is included as part of the official record. (Attachment 5-3) Item 6: Public Hearing for Notice of Final Regulation - Proposed Amendment of Regulation 61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations (exempt from General Assembly Review), Document No. 4840 (Attachment 6 -1) Mr. Joe Bowers, Program Manager, Bureau of Land and Waste Management, presented this item to the Board. The Bureau propose d amending R.61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations, to adopt the Imports and Exports of Hazardous Waste Rule published November 28, 2016, and published on August 29, 2017, at in the Federal Register by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"). The Imp orts and Exports of Hazardous Waste Rule amends existing requirements regarding the import and export of hazardous wastes from and into the United States. The Department proposed adopting the rule to maintain compliance with federal law and provide greater protection to human health and the environment by making existing import - and export -related requirements more consistent with the current import -export requirements for shipments between members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developmen t, enabling electronic submittal to the EPA of all import - and export -related documents (e.g., export notices, export annual reports), and enabling electronic validation of consent in the Automated Export System for export shipments subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\") export consent requirements prior to exit. SC Board of Health and Environmental Control, December 13 , 2018 - Page 4 of 7 Mr. Taylor opened the meeting up for public comments on this matter, but no one wished to speak. (Attachment 6 -2) Mr. Toomey moved, seconded by Dr. Gillespie, that based on the public hearing and documents herein, to find for the need and reasonableness of the Proposed Amendment of Regulation 61 -79, Hazardous Waste Management Regulations, Document No. 4840, and grant approval to publish the attached Notice of Final Regulat ion for legal effect as of the December 28, 2018 publication in the State Register. The Board voted and Motion carried. A verbatim transcript of these proceedings is included as part of the official record. (Attachment 6-3) Item 7: Public Hearing for N otice of Final Regulation - Proposed Amendment of Regulation 61 -120, South Carolina Immunization Registry, Document No. 4837 (Attachment 7 -1) Mr. Thomas Bowen, Policy Liaison for Public Health , presented this item to the Board. Regulation 61-120, South Carolina Immunization Registry, is governed by S.C. Code Section 44 -29-40, which grants the Department general direction and supervision of vaccination, screening, and immunization in the state. Section 44 -29-40(B) charges the Department with establishing a statewide immunization registry and promulgating regulations for the implementation and operation of the registry. The Bureau proposes amending R.6I -I20 to enable provision of specific Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (\"HEDIS\") data fro m the South Carolina Immunization Registry (\"Registry\") to health plans for public health purposes and to measure performance on important dimensions of care and service, including immunization data for clients. Furthermore, the amendments detail the avail ability and use of a patient portal, which will be a feature of a new Registry allowing patients to access their personal immunization records. Patients will be able to access their personal immunization records once the new Registry becomes active without the need of going through one's healthcare provider. The amendments also remove obsolete language and make general improvements and clarifications to the text. Mr. Bowen provided the Board with a letter from National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA ) supporting the proposed amendment. (Attachment 7 -2) Mr. Taylor opened the meeting up for public comments on this matter, but no one wished to speak. (Attachment 7-3) After discussion, Mr. Creel moved, seconded by Dr. Gillespie, that based on the publi c hearing and documents herein, to find for the need and reasonableness of the Proposed Amendment of Regulation 61-120, South Carolina Immunization Registry, Document No. 4837, and grant approval for submission to the General Assembly for review . The Board voted, and Motion carried. A verbatim transcript of these proceedings is included as part of the official record. (Attachment 7-4) Item 8: Public Hearing for Notice of Final Regulation -- Proposed Amendment of Regulation 61 -25, Retail Food Establ ishments, and Proposed Repeal Regulation 61 -37, Retail Food Establishment Inspection Fees, Document No. 4842 (Attachment 8 -1) Ms. Sandra Craig, Director, Bureau of Food Protection and Rabies Prevention , presented this item to the Board. SC Board of Health and Environmental Control, December 13 , 2018 - Page 5 of 7 The intent of R egulation 61-25, Retail Food Establishments , is to safeguard public health and provide consumers safe, unadulterated food and food products at the retail level. This regulation governs restaurants, grocery stores, school cafeterias, and other establishments preparing and serving food to the public. The Department last amended R.61 -25, Retail Food Establishments , in 2014. These amendments will allow the Department, through regulation, to incorporate standards of the 2017 United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") Food Code. The FDA Food Code is the national standard for practical, science - based guidance that addresses the risk factors known to cause foodborne illness outbreaks in retail food establishment settings. The amendments also inc lude proposed revisions to selected sections of R.61 -25 to reflect the current business models of the food service industry based on comments and suggestions from the regulated community. The amendments, furthermore, include combining R.61 -25 with revised provisions of R.61 -37, Retail Food Establishment Inspection Fees, which was last amended in 2002 . Specifically, the Bureau proposes revising fee schedules currently residing in R.61 -37, placing the fee schedules in R.61 -25, and repealing R.61 -37. This woul d provide the retail food industry with one streamlined regulation while allowing for necessary program support through an increase in inspection fees. Finally, these amendments include other changes deemed necessary by the Department to improve the overal l clarity, organization, and quality of the regulation. These proposed changes include, but are not limited to, stylistic changes, updates to definitions and exemptions, corrections for clarity, readability, grammar, punctuation, references, codification, and overall improvement of the text of the regulation. The Bureau held a series of five (5) stakeholder meetings across the state in advance of the Notice of Drafting period.

Item 1: Public Hearing for Notice of Final Regulation -- Proposed Amendment of Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, Exempt from General Assembly review, Document No. 4870 Mr. Robbie Brown, Director, Division of Air Assessment and Re gulations, presented this item to the Board . The South Carolina Pollution Control Act, authorizes the Department to adopt emission control regulations, standards, and limitations, and take all actions necessary or appropriate to secure to the state the benefits of federal air pollution control laws. The Department proposes this amendment for compliance with federal air pollution control laws. Pursuant to the Pollution Control Act and the federal Clean Air Act, the Department must ensure national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards are achieved and maintained in South Carolina. No state may adopt or enforce an emission standard or limitation less stringent than these federal standards or limitations. SC Board of Health and Environmental Control, January 3, 2019 - Page 2 of 4 The United States Environmental Protec tion Agency promulgates amendments to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) throughout each calendar year. Recent federal amendments to 40 CFR Parts 60, 61, and 63 include revisions to New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) mandated by 42 U.S.C. Section 7 411; federal National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) mandated by 42 U.S.C. Section 7412; and federal National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Source Categories mandated by 42 U.S.C. Section 7412. The Department proposed to ame nd Regulation 61 -62 as follows: Regulation 61 -62.60, South Carolina Designated Facility Plan and New Source Performance Standards; Regulation 61 -62.61, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP); and Regulat ion 61 -62.63, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Source Categories, to adopt the federal amendments to these standards promulgated from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017; Regulation 61 -62.68, Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, which include corrections for internal consistency, clarification, chemical nomenclature, codification, and spelling to improve the overall text as necessary; Regulation 61 -62.70, Title V Operating Permit Program, by striking paragra ph (a)(6) of Section 70.3, Applicability, to maintain state comp liance with federal regulations; Regulation 61 -62.96, Nitrogen Oxides (NOX) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Budget Trading Program, is based on the federal Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). CAIR has been replaced by the federal Cross -State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) Trading Program, adopted by the Department as Regulation 61 -62.97 on August 25, 2017. As a result, federal CAIR requirements implemented by Regulation 61 -62.96 have sunsetted and are no l onger in effect. The Department, therefore, proposes repealing Regulation 61 -62.96 in its entirety; other changes to Regulation 61 -62 that include corrections for internal consistency, clarification, reference, punctuation, codification, formatting, and sp elling to improve the overall text of Regulation 61 -62 as necessary.

The reque st by the source must also show the following: a.(a) Good faith efforts have been made to comply with the state requirements; b.(b) The source is unable to comply with the state requirements because the necessary technology or other alternative methods of control are not reasonably available or have not been available for a sufficient period of time; c.(c) Any available operating p rocedures or control measures reducing the impact of the source on ambient air concentrations have been implemented; and d.(d) The request is submitted in a timely manner. 2.(2) The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to mass emission limits which are imposed upon any source by the following requirements: a.(a) Federal New Source Performance Standards (NSPS); b.(b) National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP); c.(c) Federal or State Prevention of Significant Deter ioration (PSD) Regulations; or d.(d) Nonattainment requirements. 3.(3) Where a permanent increase in the visible emission limitation for a source is requested, the source must demonstrate that it will remain in compliance with the applicable particula te emission standard. 55 4.(4) Any alternative compliance schedule shall provide for compliance with the applicable regulations as expeditiously as practicable based on a plan submitted with the request for the alternative compliance schedule. 5.(5) Any r equest under this section will be subjected to public notice and opportunity for a public hearing. Upon approval by the Board, the recommendations of this Department shall be sent to the Administrator, or his designated representative, for approval or disa pproval. 6.(6) Where alternative compliance schedule provisions are contained elsewhere in the air pollution control regulations, those provisions shall supersede the requirements in this section. L.(L) Emergency Provisions 1.(1) An \"emergency\" means any situation arising from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events beyond the control of the source, including acts of God, in which a situation requires immediate corrective action to restore normal operation, and that causes the source to exceed a technology -based emission limitation under the permit due to unavoidable increases in emissions attributable to the emergency. An emergency shall not include noncompliance to the extent caused by improperly designed equipment, lack of pr eventative maintenance, careless or improper operation, or operator error. 2.(2) An emergency may be documented through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs and other relevant evidence that verify: a.(a) An emergency occurred and the owner or operator can identify the cause(s) of the emergency; b.(b) The permitted source was, at the time the emergency occurred, being properly operated; c.(c) During the period of the emergency, the owner or operator took all reasonable steps to minimize levels of emissions that exceeded the emission standards or other requirements in the permit; and d.(d) The owner or operator gave a verbal notification of the emergency to the Department within twenty -four (24) hours of the time when emission limitati ons were exceeded, followed by a written report within thirty (30) days. The written report shall include, at a minimum, the information required by Section II. J.1.c.i (J)(1)(c)(i) through J.1.c.viii (J)(1)(c)(viii) above.

SECTION III - EMISSIONS INVENTORY AND EMISSIONS STATEMENTS A.(A) General 1.(1) An emissions invento ry is a study or compilation of pollutant emissions. The purposes of emissions inventories are to locate air pollution sources, to define the type and size of sources, to define the type and amount of emissions from each source, to determine pollutant freq uency and duration, to determine the relative contributions to air pollution from classes of sources and of individual sources, to provide a basis for air permit fees, and to determine the adequacy of regulations and standards. The requirements of this section notwithstanding, an emissions inventory may be required from any source at any time. 2.(2) An emissions statement is a less detailed statement which focuses on emissions estimates for pollutants associated with a nonattainment designation. B.(B) Emissions Inventory Reporting Requirements 1.(1) Beginning with the effective date of this regulation, sources must submit an emissions inventory for the previous calendar year by March 31 at a frequency as outlined below: a.(a) Type A Sources are Title V Sources with annual emissions greater than or equal to any of the emission thresholds listed for Type A Sources in Table 1 below. Type A Sources must submit an emissions inventory every year. Table 1 - Minimum Point Source Reporting Thresholds by Pollutant (tons per year) Pollutants Type A Sources: Annual Cycle Potential1 or Actual2 SO X 2500 Potential 58 Table 1 - Minimum Point Source Reporting Thresholds by Pollutant (tons per year) Pollutants Type A Sources: Annual Cycle Potential1 or Actual2 VOC 250 Potential NO X 2500 Potential CO 2500 Potential Pb 0.502 Actual PM 10 250 Potential PM 2.5 250 Potential NH 3 250 Potential 1 Tons per year (tpy) potential to emit means the maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit any air pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of a source to emit an air pollutant, inclu ding air pollution control equipment and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or processed, will be treated as part of its design if the limitation is enforceable by the Administrator and included in th e source's permit prior to the end of the reporting year . 2 The EPA considers that the ambient monitoring rule threshold is 0.5 tons of actual emissions; therefore, this criterion is based on actual emissions rather than the potential -to-emit approach taken for other criteria pollutant and precursor thresholds. b.(b) All other Title V Sources with annual emissions less than the emission thresholds listed for Type A Sources in Table 1 above must submit emissions inventories every three (3) years begin ning with calendar year 2014 data. c.(c) Nonattainment area (NAA) Sources are sources located in a NAA with annual emissions during any year of the three (3) year cycle greater than or equal to any of the emission thresholds listed for NAA Sources in Ta ble 2 below. These sources that are not also Type A Sources must submit emissions inventories every three (3) years beginning with calendar year 2014 data. Table 2 - Minimum Point Source Reporting Thresholds by Pollutant (tons per year) Pollutant NAA3 Sources: Three -year Cycle Potential1 or Actual2 SO X 100 Potential VOC 100 (moderate O 3 NAA ) Potential 50 (serious O 3 NAA) 25 (severe O 3 NAA) 10 (extreme O 3 NAA) NO X 100 (all O 3 NAA) Potential CO 100 (all O 3 NAA) Potential 100 (all CO NAA) Pb 0.50 Actual PM 10 100 (moderate PM 10 NAA) Potential 59 Table 2 - Minimum Point Source Reporting Thresholds by Pollutant (tons per year) Pollutant NAA3 Sources: Three -year Cycle Potential1 or Actual2 70 (serious PM 10 NAA) PM 2.5 100 Potential NH 3 100 Potential 1 Tons per year (tpy) potential to emit means the maximum capacity of a stationary source to emit any air pollutant under its physical and operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity of a source to emit an air pollutant, including air pollution control equipment and restrictions on hours of operation or on the type or amount of material co mbusted, stored, or processed, will be treated as part of its design if the limitation is enforceable by the Administrator and included in the source's permit prior to the end of the reporting year . 2 The EPA considers that the ambient monitoring rule threshold is 0.5 tons of actual emissions; therefore, this criterion is based on actual emissions rather than the potential -to-emit approach taken for other criteria pollutant and precursor thresholds. 3 Special point source reporting thresholds apply for certain pollutants by type of NAA. The pollutants by nonattainment area are: Ozone: VOC, NO X, and CO; Carbon Monoxide: CO; and Particulate matter less than 10 microns: PM 10. 2.(2) Other Requirements a.(a) Unless otherwise indicated, all emissions in ventories must be submitted to the Department by March 31 following the year of inventory. All applicable information must be recorded in the current format for reporting emissions data provided by the Department. b.(b) All newly permitted and construct ed Title V Sources which have obtained or are in the process of obtaining a Title V permit and all newly permitted and constructed NAA Sources must complete and submit to the Department an initial emissions inventory for the source's first partial calendar year of operation and an emissions inventory for the source's first full calendar year of operation. i.(i) The partial year emissions inventory must be submitted to the Department no later than March 31 of the year following the source's partial year of operation and must include an emissions inventory from the source's operation start date through December 31 of the same year. ii.(ii) The first full calendar year emissions inventory must be submitted to the Department by March 31 of the year following the source's first calendar year of operation. iii.(iii) Sources must submit future emissions inventor ies on the schedule as described in paragraph B.1.a (B)(1)(a) , paragraph B.1.b of this section. c.(c) Any existing sources that are determined by the Department to be subject to Regulation 61 -62.70, Title V Operatin g Permit Program, and/or NAA Sources must complete and submit to the Department an emissions inventory for the previous calendar year within ninety (90) days. These sources must then submit 60 future emissions inventories on the schedule as described in parag raph B.1.a this section. d.(d) Submittal of emissions inventories outside of the schedules in this section will be accepted and reviewed only if a modification has occurred that require d issuance of an air quality permit since the last emissions inventory submittal by the source. This modification must alter the quantity or character of the source's emissions. These sources may submit a new emissions inventory following the first full ca lendar year of operation after the modification. These sources must then submit future emissions inventories on the schedule described in paragraph B.1.a (B)(1)(a) , paragraph B.1.b of this section. e.(e) Information required in an emissions inventory submittal to the Department must include the following: i.(i) Information on fuel burning equipment; ii.(ii) Types and fuel used; Exhaust parameters; v.(v) Raw process materials and quantities used; vii.(vii) Design, normal, and actual process rates; viii.(viii) Hours of operation; ix.(ix) Significant emission generating points or processes as discussed in t he current format for reporting emissions data provided by the Department; x.(x) Any desired information listed in 40 CFR Part 51 Subpart A (December 17, 2008) that is requested by the Department; xi.(xi) Emissions data from all regulated pollutants; and xii.(xii) Any additional information reasonably related to determining if emissions from an air source are causing standards of air quality to be exceeded. f.(f) A source may submit a written request to the Department for approval of an alternate method for estimating emissions outside of those methods prescribed by the Department. Such requests will be reviewed by the Department's emissions inventory staff on a c ase-by-case basis to determine if the alternate method better characterizes actual emissions for the reporting period than the Department's prescribed methods. g.(g) Emission estimates from insignificant activities listed on a source's permit are requir ed only in the initial emissions inventory submitted by the source. If emissions from these insignificant activities have not been included in a past emissions inventory submitted to the Department, the source must include these emissions in their next req uired emissions inventory submittal. h.(h) Copies of all records and reports relating to emissions inventories as required in this section must be retained by the owner/operator at the source for a minimum of five (5) years. C.(C) Emissions Statement R equirements 1.(1) Sources in areas designated nonattainment for an ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) must submit to the Department by March 31 for the previous calendar year an emissions statement which includes emissions estimates for both VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NO X) beginning with the effective date of this regulation. 61 2.(2) The statement must contain a certification that the information contained in the statement is accurate to the best knowledge of the individual certifying the statement. 3.(3) All applicable information must be recorded in the current format for reporting emissions data provided by the Department. 4.(4) Copies of all records and reports relating to emissions statements as required in this section must be ret ained by the owner or operator at the source for a minimum of five (5) years. SECTION IV - SOURCE TESTS A.(A) Applicability 1.(1) This section shall apply to the owner, operator, or representative of any source which conducts: a.(a) A source test re quired under an applicable standard or permit condition; or pursuant to a judicial or administrative order, consent agreement, or any other such binding requirement entered into after the effective date of this standard; or b.(b) Any other source test f rom which data will be submitted to the Department for any purpose including but not limited to: determination of applicability of regulatory requirements, development of emission factors, establishment of parameters for compliance assurance monitoring, co ntinuous emission monitor performance specification testing, and Relative Accuracy Test Audits (RATA). 2.(2) The Department may, on a case -by-case basis, exempt from the requirements of this section source tests which are performed for development of emission factors or for determination of applicability of regulations.

Submission of a site-specific test plan or amendments to a previously approved test plan does not constitute notification. Requirements for a complete notification include the following: a.(a) Facility name, permit number, mailing address, physical address, and contact name and phone number; b.(b) Source(s) being tested, source identification number(s), and pollutant(s) being tested; c.(c) Proposed test date and start time for each sourc e being tested; and d.(d) Approved test plan being used to conduct the test identified by Department approval date. 2.(2) In the event the owner, operator, or representative is unable to conduct the source test on the date specified in the notification, the owner, operator, or representative shall notify the Department as soon as practical by telephone and follow up in writi ng within thirty (30) days. Telephone notification shall include a description of the circumstance(s) causing the cancellation of the test, and a projected retest date. The written follow -up report shall include a description of the condition(s) which prev ented the source test from being conducted, and when applicable, what corrective action was performed, or what equipment repairs were required. 3.(3) Rescheduling of canceled source tests must meet the two -week notice requirement. However, shorter notifi cation periods may be allowed subject to Department approval. 4.(4) All tests shall be conducted by or under the direction of a person qualified by training and/or experience in the field of air pollution testing or, where required by federal regulation, meeting the 66 minimum competency requirements for air emissions testing as specified in ASTM D7036 -04, Standard Practice for Competence of Air Emission Testing Bodies. 5.(5) Unless approved otherwise by the Department, the owner, operator, or representati ve shall ensure that source tests are conducted while the source is operating at the maximum expected production rate or other production rate or operating parameter which would result in the highest emissions for the pollutants being tested or as otherwis e specified in a relevant federal or state requirement . Examples of the operating parameters that may affect emission rates are: type and composition of raw materials and fuels, isolation of control equipment modules, product types and dimensions, thermal oxidizer combustion temperature, atypical control equipment settings, etc. Some sources may have to spike fuels or raw materials to avoid being permitted at a more restrictive feed or process rate. Any source test performed at a production rate less than t he rated capacity may result in permit limits on emission rates, including limits on production if necessary. 6.(6) When conducting a source test subject to this section, the owner, operator, or representative of a source shall provide the following: a.(a) Department access to the facility to observe source tests; b.(b) Sampling ports adequate for test methods; c.(c) Safe sampling site(s); d.(d) Safe access to sampling site(s); e.(e) Utilities for sampling and testing equipment; and f.(f) Equipment and supplies necessary for safe testing of a source. E.(E) Source Test Method Performance Audit Program 1.(1) The Department may request that samples collected during any source tests be split with the Department for analysis by an independent or Department laboratory. Any request for split samples will be made in advance of the source test. 2.(2) Performance t esting shall include a test method performance audit (PA) during the performance test if a PA sample is commercially available. a.(a) PAs consist of blind audit samples supplied by an accredited audit sample provider (AASP) and analyzed during the perfo rmance test in order to provide a measure of test data bias. b.(b) An \"accredited audit sample provider (AASP)\" is an organization that has been accredited to prepare audit samples by an independent, third party accrediting body. 3.(3) The source owne r, operator, or representative of the tested facility shall obtain an audit sample, if commercially available, from an AASP for each test method used for regulatory compliance purposes. a.(a) No audit samples are required for the following test methods: Methods 3A and 3C of Appendix A-2 of 40 CFR Part 60; Methods 6C, 7E, 9, and 10 of Appendix A -4 of 40 CFR Part 60; Method 18 of Appendix A -6 of 40 CFR Part 60; Methods 20, 22, and 25A of Appendix A -7 of 40 CFR Part 60; and Methods 303, 318, 320, and 321 of Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 63. 67 b.(b) If multiple sources at a single facility are tested during a compliance test event, only one audit sample is required for each method used during a compliance test. c.(c) Upon request, the Department may waive the requirement to include an audit sample if the Department determines that an audit sample is not necessary. A waiver of the performance audit requirements to conduct a PA for a particular source does not constitute a waiver of performance audit requirement s for future source tests. d.(d) \"Commercially available\" means that two or more independent AASPs have blind audit samples available for purchase. If the source owner, operator, or representative cannot find an audit sample for a specific method, the owner, operator, or representative s hall consult the EPA Web site at the following URL, http://www.epa.gov/ttn/emc, to confirm whether there is an AASP that can supply an audit sample for that method. e.(e) If the EPA Web site does not list an available audit sample at least 60 days prior to the beginning of the compliance test, the source owner, operator, or representative shall not be required to include an audit sample as part of the quality assurance program for the compliance test. f.(f) When ordering an audit sample, the source, o perator, or representative shall give the AASP an estimate for the concentration of each pollutant that is emitted by the source or the estimated concentration of each pollutant based on the permitted level and the name, address, and phone number of the De partment. g.(g) The source owner, operator, or representative shall report the results for the audit sample along with a summary of the emission test results for the audited pollutant to the Department and shall report the results of the audit sample to the AASP.

SECTION V - CREDIBLE EVIDENCE A.(A) The Department promulgated Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards , and developed the South Carolina Air Quality Implementation Plan to provide enforceable emission limitations; to establish an adequate enforcement program; to require owners or operators of stationary sources to monitor emissions, submit periodic reports of such emissions, and maintain records as specified by various regulations and permits; and to evaluate reports and records for consistency with the applicable emission limitation or standard on a continuing basis over time. The m onitoring data collected and records of operations would serve as the basis for a source to certify compliance, and could be used by the Department as direct evidence of an enforceable violation of the underlying emission limitation or standard. B.(B) The purpose of this section is: 1.(1) To clarify the statutory authority of Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards , and the South Carolina Air Quality Implementation Plan , whereby non -reference test data and 70 various kinds of information already available and utilized for other purposes may be used to demonstrate compliance or noncompliance with emission standards; 2.(2) To eliminate any potential ambiguity regarding language that has been interpreted to provide for exclusive reliance on reference test methods as the means of certifying compliance with various emission limits; and 3.(3) To curtail language that limits the types of testing or monitoring data that may be used for determining compliance and for establishing vio lations. C.(C) The following are applicable in the determination of noncompliance by the Department or for compliance certification by the owners or operators of stationary sources: 1.(1) Enforcement - Consistent with South Carolina's Environmental Audi t Privilege and Voluntary Disclosure Act, codified as S.C. Code Ann. Sections 48 -57-10 et seq., and notwithstanding any other provision in the South Carolina Air Quality Implementation Plan , any credible evidence or information relevant to whether a source would have been in compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test had been performed, can be used to establish whether or not a person has violated or is in violation of any standard in the plan; and 2.(2) Comp liance Certifications - Consistent with South Carolina's Environmental Audit Privilege and Voluntary Disclosure Act, codified as S.C. Code Ann. Sections 48 -57-10 et seq., and notwithstanding any other provision in the South Carolina Air Quality Implementat ion Plan , the owner or operator may use any credible evidence or information relevant to whether a source would have been in compliance with applicable requirements if the appropriate performance or compliance test had been performed for the purpose of sub mitting compliance certifications. 61-62.5. Standard No. 2. Ambient Air Quality Standards. The following table, unless otherwise noted, constitutes the primary and secondary ambient air quality standards for the State of South Carolina. The computations for determining if the applicable standard is met, along with the analytical methods to be used, will be those applicable Federal Reference Methods and Interpretations published in the Appendices to 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 50, or those methods designated as Federal Equivalent Methods (FEM) in accordance with 40 CFR Part 53. In the case of Gaseous Fluorides, either the double paper tape sampler method (ASTM D -3266 -91 or later), the sodium bicarbonate -coated glass tube and particulate filte r method (ASTM D -3268 -91 or later), or an approved method may be used.

SECTION II - DEFINITIONS For the purposes of this regula tion, the following definitions shall apply: A.(A) Annual Capacity Factor: Means the ratio between the actual heat input to a combustion unit from the fuels during a calendar year and the potential heat input to the steam generating unit had it been opera ted for 8,760 hours during a calendar year at the maximum steady state design heat input capacity. B.(B) Burner Assembly: Means any complete, pre -engineered device that combines air (or oxygen) and fuel in a controlled manner and admits this mixture into a combustion chamber in such a way as to ensure safe and efficient combustion. A self -contained chamber such as is found on a combustion turbine is not a burner assembly for the purposes of this regulation. C.(C) Case -by-Case NO X Control: Means an emissio ns limitation based on the maximum degree of reduction for NO X which would be emitted from any new source which the Department, on a case -by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievab le for such source through application of production processes or available methods, systems, and techniques. In no event shall application of NO X control result in emissions of any pollutant which would exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable stand ard. If the Department determines that technological or economic limitations on the application of measurement methodology to a particular source would make the impositions of an emission standard infeasible, a design, equipment, work practice, operational standard, or combination thereof, may be prescribed instead to satisfy the requirement for the application of NO X control. Such standard shall, to the degree possible, set forth the emissions reduction achievable by implementation of such design, equipmen t, work practice or operation, and shall provide for compliance by means which achieve equivalent results. D.(D) Combustion Control Device: Means, but is not limited to, any equipment that is used to destroy or remove air pollutant(s) prior to discharge t o the atmosphere, excluding boilers, process heaters, dryers, furnaces, digesters, ovens, combustors, and similar combustion devices. Such equipment includes, but is not limited to, thermal oxidizers, catalytic oxidizers, and flares. E.(E) Constructed: Me ans the on -site fabrication, erection, or installation of the NO X emitting source. F.(F) Equivalent Technology: Means any item that is identical or functionally equivalent to the existing component. This component may serve the same purpose or function as the replaced component, but may be different in some respects or improved in some ways.

I.(I) New affected source: Means any affected source which has been constructed after June 25, 2004 , or meets the applicability requirements of Section (1)I(A)(3). A new affected source will not be considered an existing affected source at burner assembly replace ment under Section (1)I(A)(2). (J) Non -routine maintenance is an unforeseen failure of a single burner assembly in an existing affected source with multiple burner application forcing an unplanned replacement of the existing burner. J.(K) Source: Means an individual NO X emission unit. a stationary NO X emission unit, comprised of one or more burners. SECTION III - STANDARD REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW AFFECTED SOURCES A.(A) Those affected sources as defined in Section I(A)(1) and (A)(3) above shall apply NO X controls to achieve the limitations provided in Table 1 of this section. Unless otherwise noted, all emission limits for affected sources required to use Continuous Emissions Monitoring (CEMS) shall be based on thirty (30) day rolling averages.

(i)(a) The requirements of this regulation apply to the construction of any new major stationary source (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(32)) or any project at an existing major stationary source in an area designated as attainment or unclassifiable under 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 81.341. (ii)(b) The requirements of paragraphs (j)(J) through (r)(R) apply to the construction of any new major stationary source or the major modification of any existing major stationary source, except as this section otherwise provides. (iii)(c) No new major stationary source or major modification to which the requirements of paragraphs (j)(J) through (r)(R)(5) apply shall begin actual construction without a permit that states that the major stationary source or major modification will meet those requirements. The Department has authority to issue any such permit. 85 (iv)(d) The requirements of the program will be applied in accordance with the principles set out in paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(a) (A)(2)(d)(i) through (f)(A)(2)(d)(vi) . (a)(i) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph s (a)(2)(v) and (vi) (A)(2)(e) , and consistent with the definition of major modification contained in paragraph (b)(B)(30), a project is a major modification for a regulated New Source Revie w (NSR) pollutant if it causes two types of emissions increases - a significant emissions increase (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(50)), and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in paragraphs (b)(B)(34) and (b)(B)(49)). The project is not a maj or modification if it does not cause a significant emissions increase. If the project causes a significant emissions increase, then the project is a major modification only if it also results in a significant net emissions increase. (b)(ii) The procedu re for calculating (before beginning actual construction) whether a significant emissions increase ( that is , the first step of the process) will occur depends upon the type of emissions units being modified, according to paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(c) (A)(2)(d)(i ii) through (f)(A)(2)(d)(vi) . The procedure for calculating (before beginning actual construction) whether a significant net emissions increase will occur at the major stationary source ( that is , the second step of the process) is contained in the definiti on in paragraph (b)(B)(34). Regardless of any such preconstruction projections, a major modification results if the project causes a significant emissions increase and a significant net emissions increase. (c)(iii) Actual -to-projected -actual applicabil ity test for projects that only involve existing emissions units. A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference between the projected actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(41)) a nd the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) (B)(4)(a) and (ii)(B)(4)(b) ), for each existing emissions unit, equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(49)). (d)(iv) Actual -to-potential test for projects that only involve construction of a new emissions unit(s). A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference between the potential to emit (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(37)) from each new emissions unit following completion of the project and the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) (B)(4)(c) ) of these units before the project equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defin ed in paragraph (b)(B)(49)). (e)(v) [Reserved] (f)(vi) Hybrid test for projects that involve multiple types of emissions units. A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the emissions increases for each emissions unit, using the method specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(iv)(c) (A)(2)(d)(iii) and (d)(A)(2)(d)(iv) as applicable with respect to each emissions unit, for each type of emissions unit equals or exceeds, the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(49)). (v)(e) For any major stationary source for a Plantwide Applicability Limitation (PAL) for a regulated NSR pollutant, the major stationary source shall comply with the requirements under paragraph (aa) Section (AA) . (b)(B) Definitions. For the purposes of this regulation: For the purposes of this regulation: 86 (1)(i)(a) \"Actual emissions \" means the actual rate of emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant from an emissions unit, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) (B)(1)(b) through (b)(1)(iv) (B)(1)(d) , except that this definition shall not apply for calculating whether a signi ficant emissions increase has occurred, or for establishing a PAL under paragraph (aa) Section (AA) . Instead, paragraphs (b)(B)(41) and (b)(B)(4) shall apply for those purposes. (ii)(b) In general, actual emissions as of a particular date shall equal the average rate, in tons per year (tpy) , at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during a consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period which precedes the particular date and which is representative of normal source operation. The Department shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. Actual emissions shall be calculated using the unit's actual operating hours, production rates, and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the selected time period. (iii)(c) The Department may presume that source -specific allowable emissions for the unit are equivalent to the actual emissions of the unit . (iv)(d) For any emissions unit that has not begun normal operations on the particular date, actual emissions shall equal the potential to emit of the unit on that date. (2) \"Adverse impact on visibility \" means visibility impairment which interferes with the management, protection, preservation or enjoyment of the visitor's visual experience of the Class I area. This determination must be made on a case -by-case basis taking into account the geographic extent, intensity, duration, frequency and time of visibility impairment, and how these factors correlate with (1) times of visitor use of the Class I area, and (2) the frequency and timing of natural conditions that reduce visibility. (3) \"Allowable emissions \" means the emissions rate of a stationary s ource calculated using the maximum rated capacity of the source (unless the source is subject to federally enforceable limits which restrict the operating rate, or hours of operation, or both) and the most stringent of the following: (i)(a) The applicab le standards as set forth in 40 CFR Parts 60 and 61; (ii)(b) The applicable State Implementation Plan emissions limitation, including those with a future compliance date; or (iii)(c) The emissions rate specified as a federally enforceable permit cond ition, including those with a future compliance date. (4) \"Baseline actual emissions \" means the rate of emissions, in tpy tons per year , of a regulated NSR pollutant, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (b)(4)(i) (B)(4)(a) through (iv)(B)(4)(d) . (i)(a) For any existing electric utility steam generating unit, baseline actual emissions means the average rate, in tpy tons per year , at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period selected by the owner or operator within the five ( 5)-year period immediately preceding when the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project. The Department shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. (a)(i) The average rate shall include fugitive emissions to the extent quantifiable, and emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. 87 (b)(ii) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any non -compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above any emission limitation that was legally enforceable during the consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period. (c)(iii) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple emissions units, only one consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for the emissions units being changed. A different consecutive twen ty-four ( 24)-month period can be used for each regulated NSR pollutant. (d)(iv) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual emissions, in tpy tons per year , and for adjusting this amount if required by paragraph (b)(4)(i)(b) (B)(4)(a)(ii) . (ii)(b) For an existing emissions unit (other than an electric utility steam generating unit), baseline actual emissions means the average rate, in tpy tons per year, at which the emissions unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period selected by the owner or operator within the ten (10)-year period immediately preceding either the date the owner or operator begins actu al construction of the project, or the date a complete permit application is received by the Department for a permit required under this section or under a plan approved by the Administrator, whichever is earlier, except that the ten ( 10)-year period shall not include any period earlier than November 15, 1990. The Department reserves the right to determine if the twenty -four ( 24)-month period selected is appropriate. (a)(i) The average rate shall include fugitive emissions to the extent quantifiable, an d emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (b)(ii) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any non -compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above an emission limitation that was legally enf orceable during the consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period. (c)(iii) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any emissions that would have exceeded an emission limitation with which the major stationary source must currently comply, h ad such major stationary source been required to comply with such limitations during the consecutive twenty -four (24)-month period. However, if an emission limitation is part of a maximum achievable control technology standard that the Administrator propos ed or promulgated under 40 CFR Part 63, the baseline actual emissions need only be adjusted if the State has taken credit for such emissions reductions in an attainment demonstration or maintenance plan consistent with the requirements of 40 CFR 51.165(a)( 3)(ii)(G). (d)(iv) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple emissions units, only one consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for all the emissions units being changed. A different consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period can be used for each regulated NSR pollutant. (e)(v) The average rate shall not be bas ed on any consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual emissions, in tpy tons per year , and for adjusting this amount if required by paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(b) (B)(4)(b)(ii) and (c)(B)(4)(b)(iii) . (iii)(c) For a new emissions unit, the baseline actual emissions for purposes of determining the emissions increase that will result from the initial construction and operation of such unit shall equal zero; and thereafter, for all other purposes, shall equal the unit's potential to emit. 88 (iv)(d) For a PAL for a stationary source, the baseline actual emissions shall be calculated for existing electric utility steam generating units in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (b)(4)(i) (B)(4)(a) , for other existing emissions units in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) (B)(4)(b) , and for a new emissions unit in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) (B)(4)(c) . (5)(i)(a) \"Baseline area \" means any intrastate area (and every part thereof) designated as attainment or unclassifiable under Section 107(d)(1)(A)(ii) or (iii) of the Clean Air Act in which the major source or major modification establishing the minor source baseline date would con struct or would have an air quality impact for the pollutant for which the baseline date is established, as follows: Equal to or greater than one (1) microgram(s) per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m3) (annual average) for SO 2, NO 2, or PM 10; or equal or greater than 0.3 \u00b5g/m3 (annual average) for PM 2.5. (ii)(b) Area redesignations under Section 107(d)(1)(A)(ii) or 107(d)(1)(A)(iii) of the Clean Air Act cannot intersect or be smaller than the area of impact of any major stationary source or major modification which: (a)(i) Establishes a minor source baseline date; or (b)(ii) Is subject to 40 CFR 52.21 or under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR 51.166 . and would be constructed in the same state as the state proposing the redesignation. (iii)(c) Any baseline area established originally for the TSP increments shall remain in effect and shall apply for purposes of determining the amount of available PM 10 increments, except that such baseline area shall not remain in effect if the Department rescind s the corresponding minor source baseline date in accordance with paragraph (b)(31)(iv) (B)(31)(d) . (6)(i)(a) \"Baseline concentration \" means that ambient concentration level that exists in the baseline area at the time of the applicable minor source basel ine date. A baseline concentration is determined for each pollutant for which a minor source baseline date is established and shall include: (a)(i) The actual emissions, as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(1), representative of sources in existence on the a pplicable minor source baseline date, except as provided in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) (B)(6)(b) ; and (b)(ii) The allowable emissions of major stationary sources that commenced construction before the major source baseline date, but were not in operation by t he applicable minor source baseline date. (ii)(b) The following will not be included in the baseline concentration and will affect the applicable maximum allowable increase(s): (a)(i) Actual emissions, as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(1), from any maj or stationary source on which construction commenced after the major source baseline date; and (b)(ii) Actual emissions increases and decreases, as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(1), at any stationary source occurring after the minor source baseline date. (7) \"Begin actual construction \" means, in general, initiation of physical on -site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature. Such activities include, but are not limited to, installation of building supports and founda tions, laying underground pipework and construction of permanent storage structures. With respect to a change in method of operations, this term refers to those on-site activities other than preparatory activities which mark the initiation of the change. 89 (8) \"Best available control technology (BACT) \" means an emissions limitation (including a visible emission standard) based on the maximum degree of reduction for each pollutant subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act which would be emitted from any proposed major stationary source or major modification which the Department, on a case -by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such source or modification through applicat ion of production processes or available methods, systems, and techniques, including fuel cleaning or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of such pollutant. In no event shall application of BACT result in emissions of any polluta nt which would exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable standard under 40 CFR Parts 60 and 61. If the Department determines that technological or economic limitations on the application of measurement methodology to a particular emissions unit would make the imposition of an emissions standard infeasible, a design, equipment, work practice, operational standard, or combination thereof, may be prescribed instead to satisfy the requirement for the application of BACT. Such standard shall, to the degree possible, set forth the emissions reduction achievable by implementation of such design, equipment, work practice or operation, and shall provide for compliance by means which achieve equivalent results. (9)(a) \"Building, structure, facility, or installation \" means all of the pollutant -emitting activities which belong to the same industrial grouping, are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common control) except t he activities of any vessel.

(3) Visibility analysis. The Department shall consider any analysis performed by the Federal Land Manager, provided within thirty (30) days of the notification required by paragraph (p)(P)(1), that shows that a proposed new major stationary source or major modification may have an adverse impact on visibility in any Class I area. Where the Department finds that such an analysis does not demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department that an adverse impact on visibility will result in the Federal Cl ass I area, the Department must, in the notice of public hearing on the permit application, either explain its decision or give notice as to where the explanation can be obtained. (4) Denial - impact on air quality related values. The Federal Land Manager of any such lands may demonstrate to the Department that the emissions from a proposed source or modification would have an adverse impact on the air quality -related values (including visibility) of those lands, notwithstanding that the change in air qual ity resulting from emissions from such source or modification would not cause or 115 contribute to concentrations which would exceed the maximum allowable increases for a Class I area. If the Department concurs with such demonstration, then the permit shall no t be issued. (5) Class I variances. The owner or operator of a proposed source or modification may demonstrate to the Federal Land Manager that the emissions from such source or modification would have no adverse impact on the air quality related values of any such lands (including visibility), notwithstanding that the change in air quality resulting from emissions from such source or modification would cause or contribute to concentrations which would exceed the maximum allowable increases for a Class I area. If the Federal Land Manager concurs with such demonstration and so certifies, the state may authorize the Administrator : Provided, That , provided that the applicable requirements of this regulation are otherwise met, to issue the permit with such emi ssion limitations as may be necessary to assure that emissions of sulfur dioxide, PM 2.5, PM 10, and nitrogen oxides would not exceed the following maximum allowable increases over minor source baseline concentration for such pollutants: Pollutant Maximum A llowable Increase (micrograms per cubic meter) PM 2.5: annual arithmetic mean 4 24-hr maximum 9 PM 10: annual arithmetic mean 17 24-hr maximum 30 Sulfur dioxide: annual arithmetic mean 20 24-hr maximum 91 3-hr maximum 325 Nitrogen dioxide: annual arithmetic mean 25 (6) Sulfur dioxide variance by Governor with Federal Land Manager's concurrence. The owner or operator of a proposed source or modification which cannot be approved under paragraph (q)(Q)(4) may demonstrate to the Governor that the source cannot be constructed by reason of any maximum allowable increase for sulfur dioxide for a period of twenty -four (24) hours or less applicable to any Class I area and, in the case of Federal mandatory Class I areas, that a variance under this clause would not adversely affect the air quality related values of the area (including visibility). The Governor, after consideration of the Federal Land Manager's recommendation (if any) and concurrence, may, after notice and public hearing, grant a variance f rom such maximum allowable increase. If such variance is granted, the Department shall issue a permit to such source or modification pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (q)(Q)(7): Provided , provided that the applicable requirements of this regulation are otherwise met. (7) Variance by the Governor with the President's concurrence. In any case where the Governor recommends a variance in which the Federal Land Manager does not concur, the recommendations of the Governor and the Federal Land Manager sh all be transmitted to the President. The President may approve the Governor's recommendation if it is found that the variance is in the national interest. If the variance is approved, the Department shall issue a permit pursuant to the requirements of para graph (q)(Q)(7): Provided , provided that the applicable requirements of this regulation are otherwise met. (8) Emission limitations for Presidential or gubernatorial variance. In the case of a permit issued pursuant to paragraph (q)(Q)(5) or (q)(Q)(6) th e source or modification shall comply with such emission limitations as may be necessary to assure that emissions of sulfur dioxide from the source or modification would not (during any day on which the otherwise applicable maximum allowable increases are exceeded) cause or contribute to concentrations which would exceed the following maximum allowable increases over the baseline concentration and to assure that such emissions would not cause or contribute to concentrations 116 which exceed the otherwise applic able maximum allowable increases for periods of exposure of twenty -four (24) hours or less for more than eighteen (18) days, not necessarily consecutive, during any annual period: MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE INCREASE (Micrograms per cubic meter) Period of exposure Terrain Areas Low High 24-hr maximum 36 62 3-hr maximum 130 221 (q)(Q) Public participation. (1) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of an application to construct, or any addition to such application, the Department shall advise the applicant of any deficiency in the application or in the information submitted and transmit a copy of such application to EPA.

(2) In accordance with Regulation 61 -30, Environmental Protection Fees , the Department shall make a final determination on the application. This involves performing the following actions in a timely manner : (i)(a) Make a preliminary determination whether construction should be approved, approved with conditions, or disapproved. (ii)(b) Make available in at least one location in each region in which the proposed source or modification would be construc ted a copy of all materials the applicant submitted, a copy of the preliminary determination and a copy or summary of other materials, if any, considered in making the preliminary determination. This requirement may be met by making these materials availab le at a physical location or on a public website identified by the Department. (iii)(c) Notify the public, by advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in each region in which the proposed source or modification would be constructed, of the application, the preliminary determination, the degree of increment consumption that is expected from the source or modification, and the opportunity for comment at a public hearing as well as written public comment. Alternatively, these notifications may be made on a public website identified by the Department. However, the Department's selected notification method (i.e., either newspaper or website), known as the \"consistent noticing method,\" shall be used for all permits subject to notice under this sect ion and may, when appropriate, be supplemented by other noticing methods on individual permits. If the Department selects website notice as its consistent noticing method, the notice shall be available for the duration of the public comment period and shal l include the notice of public comment, the draft permit, information on how to access the administrative record for the draft permit and how to request and/or attend a public hearing on the draft permit. posting the notice, for the duration of the public comment period, on a public website identified by the Department. This consistent noticing method shall be used for all draft permits subject to notice under this section. The public website notice shall include a notice of public comment including notice of the application, the preliminary determination, the degree of increment consumption that is expected from the source or modification, and the opportunity for comment at a public hearing as well as written public comment. The public website notice shall also include the draft permit, information on how to access the administrative record for the draft permit and how to request and/or attend a public hearing on the draft permit. The Department may use additional means to provide adequate notice to the affe cted public, including by 117 publishing the notice in a newspaper of general circulation in each region in which the proposed source or modification would be constructed (or in a state publication designed to give general public notice). (iv)(d) Send a cop y of the notice of public comment to the applicant, the Administrator of EPA, and to officials and agencies having cognizance over the location where the proposed construction would occur as follows: The chief executives of the city and county where the so urce or modification would be located, any comprehensive regional land use planning agency and any state, Federal Land Manager, or Indian Governing Body whose lands may be affected by emissions from the source or modification. (v)(e) Provide opportunity for a public hearing for interested persons to appear and submit written or oral comments on the air quality impact of the source or modification, alternatives to the source or modification, the control technology required, and other appropriate considera tions. (vi)(f) Consider all written comments submitted within a time specified in the notice of public comment and all comments received at any public hearing in making a final decision on the approvability of the application. No later than ten (10) day s after the close of the public comment period, the applicant may submit a written response to any comments submitted by the public. The Department shall consider the applicant's response in making a final decision. The Department shall make all comments a vailable for public inspection in the same location or on the same website where the Department made available preconstruction information relating to the proposed source or modification. (vii)(g) Make a final determination whether construction should b e approved, approved with conditions, or disapproved pursuant to this section. (viii) (h) Notify the applicant in writing of the final determination and make such notification available for public inspection at the same location or on the same website where the Department made available preconstruction information and public comments relating to the source or modification. (ix)(i) Notify EPA of every action related to the consideration of the permit. (3) The requirements of Section (q)(Q), Public Par ticipation, of this standard shall not apply to any major plant or major modification which Section (i)(I), Exemptions, would exempt from the requirements of Sections (k)(K), (m)(M), and (o)(O), but only to the extent that, with respect to each of the crit eria for construction approval under the South Carolina State Implementation Plan and for exemption under Section (i)(I), requirements providing the public with at least as much participation in each material determination as those of Section (q)(Q) have been met in the granting of such construction approval. (r)(R) Source obligation. In addition to all other applicable requirements specified in this regulation, the owner or operator shall comply with the requirements of paragraphs (r)(R)(1) thro ugh (r)(R)(8). (1) Any owner or operator who constructs or operates a source or modification not in accordance with the application submitted pursuant to this section or with the terms of any approval to construct, or any owner or operator of a source or modification subject to this section who commences construction after the effective date of these regulations without applying for and receiving approval hereunder, shall be subject to appropriate enforcement action. (2) Approval to construct shall beco me invalid if construction is not commenced within eighteen (18) months after receipt of such approval, if construction is discontinued for a period of eighteen (18) months or more, or if construction is not completed within a reasonable time. The Departme nt may extend the 118 eighteen ( 18)-month period upon a satisfactory showing that an extension is justified. This provision does not apply to the time period between construction of the approved phases of a phased construction project; each phase must commence construction within eighteen (18) months of the projected and approved commencement date. (3) Approval to construct shall not relieve any owner or operator of the responsibility to comply fully with applicable provisions of the State Implementation Plan and any other requirements under local, state, or federal law. (4) At such time that a particular source or modification becomes a major stationary source or major modification solely by virtue of a relaxation in any enforceable limitation which was established after August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or mo dification otherwise to emit a pollutant, such as a restriction on hours of operation, then the requirements or paragraphs (j)(J) through (r)(R) shall apply to the source or modification as though construction had not yet commenced on the source or modific ation. (5) Reserved (6) Monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting. The provisions of this paragraph (r)(R)(6) apply to with respect to any regulated NSR pollutant emitted from projects at an existing emissions unit at a major stationary source (other tha n projects at a source with a PAL) in circumstances where there is a reasonable possibility that a project that is not a part of a major modification may result in a significant emissions increase and the owner or operator elects to use the method specifie d in paragraphs (b)(41)(ii)(a) (B)(41)(b)(i) through (c)(B)(41)(b)(iii) for calculating projected actual emissions. (i)(a) If the project requires construction permitting under Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II, \"Permit Requirements,\" the owner or operator shall provide a copy of the information set out in paragraph (r)(6)(ii) (R)(6)(b) as part of the permit application to the Department. If construction permitting under Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II, \"Permit Requirements,\" is not required, the owner or oper ator shall maintain the information set out in paragraph (r)(6)(ii) (R)(6)(b) . (ii)(b) Before beginning actual construction of the project, the owner or operator shall document and maintain a record of the following information: (a)(i) A description of the project; (b)(ii) Identification of the emissions unit(s) whose emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant could be affected by the project; and (c)(iii) A description of the applicability test used to determine that the project is not a major modification for any regulated NSR pollutant, including the baseline actual emissions, the projected actual emissions, the amount of emissions excluded under paragra ph (b)(41)(ii)(c) (B)(41)(b)(iii) and an explanation for why such amount was excluded, and any netting calculations, if applicable. (c) If the emissions unit is an existing electric utility steam generating unit, before beginning actual construction, the owner or operator shall provide a copy of the information set out in paragraph (R)(6)(b) of this section to the Department. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require the owner or operator of such a unit to obtain any determination from the D epartment before beginning actual construction. (iii)(d) The owner or operator shall monitor the emissions of any regulated NSR pollutant that could increase as a result of the project and that is emitted by any emissions unit identified in paragraph 119 (r)(6)(ii)(b) (R)(6)(b)(ii) ; and calculate and maintain a record of the annual emissions, in tpy tons per year on a calendar year basis, for a period of five (5) years following resumption of regular operations after the change, or for a period of ten (10) ye ars following resumption of regular operations after the change if the project increases the design capacity of or potential to emit that regulated NSR pollutant at such emissions unit. (iv)(e) If the unit is an existing electric utility steam generatin g unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Department within sixty ( 60) days after the end of each year during which records must be generated under paragraph (r)(6)(iii) (R)(6)(d) setting out the unit's annual emissions during the calendar year that preceded submission of the report. (v)(f) If the unit is an existing unit other than an electric utility steam generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Department if the annual emissions, in tpy tons per year , from t he project identified in paragraph (r)(6)(ii) (R)(6)(b) , exceed the baseline actual emissions (as documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (r)(6)(ii)(c) (R)(6)(b)(iii) ), by a significant amount (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(49)) for that regulated N SR pollutant, and if such emissions differ from the preconstruction projection as documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (R)(6)(b)(iii) (r)(6)(ii)(c) . Such report shall be submitted to the Department within sixty ( 60) days after the end of such yea r. The report shall contain the following: (a)(i) The name, address and telephone number of the major stationary source; (b)(ii) The annual emissions as calculated pursuant to paragraph (r)(6)(iii) (R)(6)(d) ; and (c)(iii) Any other information needed to make a compliance determination ( for example , an explanation as to why the emissions differ from the preconstruction projection). (g) A \"reasonable possibility\" under paragraph (R)(6) of this section occurs when the owne r or operator calculates the project to result in either: (i) A projected actual emissions increase of at least fifty (50) percent of the amount that is a \"significant emissions increase,\" as defined under paragraph (B)(50) of this section (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant; or (ii) A projected actual emissions increase that, added to the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (B)(41)(b)( iii) of this section, sums to at least fifty (50) percent of the amount that is a \"significant emissions increase,\" as defined under paragraph (B)(50) of this section (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant. For a project for which a reasonable possibility occurs only within the meaning of paragraph (R)(6)(g)( ii) of this section, and not also within the meaning of paragraph (R)(6)(g)( i) of this section, then provisions (R)(6)(c) through (R)(6)(f) do not apply to the project. (7) If a project at a source with a PAL requires construction permitting under Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II, \"Permit Requirements\", the owner or operator shall provide notification of source status as part of the permit application to the Department. (8) The owner or operator of the source shall make the information required to be documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (r)(R)(6) available for review upon a request for inspection by the Department or the general public pursuant to the requirements contained in 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(viii). (s)(S) through (u)(U)(3) [Reserved] 120 (u)(U)(4) In the case of a source or modification which proposes to construct in a Class III area, emissions from which would cause or contribute to air quality e xceeding the maximum allowable increase applicable if the area were designated a Class II area, and where no standard under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act has been promulgated for such source category, the Administrator must approve the determination of BACT as set forth in the permit. (v)(V) Innovative control technology. (1) An owner or operator of a proposed major stationary source or major modification may request the Department in writing no later than the close of the comment period under 40 CFR 124.10 to approve a system of innovative control technology. (2) The Department shall, with the consent of the governor(s) of the affected state(s), determine that the source or modification may employ a system of innovative control technology, if: (i)(a) The proposed control system would not cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety in its operation or function; (ii)(b) The owner or operator agrees to achieve a level of continuous emissions reduction equivalent to that which would have been required under paragraph (j)(J)(2), by a date specified by the Department. Such date shall not be later than four (4) years from the time of startup or seven (7) years from permit issuance; (iii)(c) The source or modification would meet the requirements of paragraphs (j)(J) and (k)(K), based on the emissions rate that the stationary source employing the system of innovative control technology would be required to meet on the date specified by the Department; (iv)(d) The source or modification would not before the date specified by the Department: (a)(i) Cause or contribute to a violation of an applicable National Ambient Air Quality Standard; or (b)(ii) Impact any area where an applicable increment is known to be violated; and (v)(e) All other applicable requirements including those for public par ticipation have been met. (vi)(f) The provisions of paragraph (p)(P) (relating to Class I areas) have been satisfied with respect to all periods during the life of the source or modification. (3) The Department shall withdraw any approval to employ a system of innovative control technology made under this section, if: (i)(a) The proposed system fails by the specified date to achieve the required continuous emissions reduction rate; or (ii)(b) The proposed system fails before the specified date so as to contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety; or (iii)(c) The Department decides at any time that the proposed system is unlikely to achieve the required level of control or to protect the public health, welfare, or saf ety. 121 (4) If a source or modification fails to meet the required level of continuous emission reduction within the specified time period or the approval is withdrawn in accordance with paragraph (v)(V)(3), the Department may allow the source or modificati on up to an additional three (3) years to meet the requirement for the application of best available control technology through use of a demonstrated system of control. (w)(W) Permit rescission . (1) Any permit issued under this section or a prior version of this regulation shall remain in effect, unless and until it expires or is rescinded under this paragraph (w)(W). (2) Any owner or operator of a stationary source or modification who holds a p ermit issued under this section for the construction of a new source or modification that meets the requirement in paragraph (w)(W)(3) of this section may request that the Department rescind the permit or a particular portion of the permit. (3) The Depar tment may grant an application for rescission if the application shows that this section would not apply to the source or modification. (4) If the Department rescinds a permit under this paragraph, the Department shall post a notice of the rescission det ermination on a public website identified by the Department within sixty ( 60) days of (aa)(AA) (1) through (aa)(AA) (15) govern actuals PALs. (1) Applicability. (i)(a) The Department may approve the use of an actuals PAL for any existing major stationary source if the PAL meets the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(AA) (1) through (aa)(AA) (15). The term \"PAL\" shall mean \"actuals PAL\" throughout paragraph (aa) Section (AA) . (ii)(b) Any physical change in or change in the method of operation of a major stationary source that maintains its total source -wide emissions below the PAL level, meets the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(AA)(1) through (aa)(AA) (15), and complies with the PAL permit: (a)(i) Is not a major modification for the PAL pollutant; (b)(ii) Does not have to be approved through Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard 7, Prevention of Significant Deterioration . However, the change will be reviewed through R. Regulation 61-62.1, Section II, A. Permit Requirements ; and (c)(iii) Is not subject to the provisions in paragraph (r)(R)(4) (restrictions on relaxing enforceable emission limitations that the major stationary source used to avoid applicability of the major NSR program). 122 (iii)(c) Except as provided under paragraph (aa)(1)(ii)(c) (AA)(1)(b)(iii) , a major stationary source shall continue to comply with all applicable federal or state requirements, emission limit ations, and work practice requirements that were established prior to the effective date of the PAL. (2) Definitions. The definitions in paragraphs (aa)(2)(i) (AA)(2)(a) through (aa)(2)(xi) (AA)(2)(k) shall apply to actual PALs consistent with paragraphs (aa)(AA) (1) through (aa)(AA) (15). When a term is not defined in these paragraphs, it shall have the meaning given in paragraph (b)(B) or in the Clean Air Act. (i)(a) Actuals PAL for a major stationary source means a PAL based on the baseline actual emiss ions (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(4)) of all emissions units (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(20)) at the source, that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL pollutant. (ii)(b) \"Allowable emissions \" means \"allowable emissions\" as defined in paragr aph (b)(B)(3), except as this definition is modified according to paragraphs (aa)(2)(ii)(a) (AA)(2)(b)(i) and (aa)(2)(ii)(b) (AA)(2)(b)(ii) . (a)(i) The allowable emissions for any emissions unit shall be calculated considering any emission limitations that are enforceable as a practical matter on the emissions unit's potential to emit. (b)(ii) An emissions unit's potential to emit shall be determ ined using the definition in paragraph (b)(B)(37), except that the words \"or enforceable as a practical matter\" should be added after \"federally enforceable.\" (iii)(c) \"Small emissions unit \" means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emi t the PAL pollutant in an amount less than the significant level for that PAL pollutant, as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(49) or in the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower. (iv)(d) \"Major emissions unit \" means: (a)(i) Any emissions unit that emits or ha s the potential to emit one hundred ( 100) tpy tons per year or more of the PAL pollutant in an attainment area; or (b)(ii) Any emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit the PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal to or greater than the ma jor source threshold for the PAL pollutant as defined by the Clean Air Act for nonattainment areas. For example, in accordance with the definition of major stationary source in Section 182(c) of the Clean Air Act, an emissions unit would be a major emissio ns unit for VOC if the emissions unit is located in a serious ozone nonattainment area and it emits or has the potential to emit fifty (50) or more tons of VOC per year. (v)(e) \"Plantwide applicability limitation (PAL) \" means an emission limitation expr essed in tpy tons per year , for a pollutant at a major stationary source, that is enforceable as a practical matter and established source -wide in accordance with paragraphs (aa)(AA) (1) through (aa)(AA) (15). (vi)(f) \"PAL effective date \" generally means the date of issuance of the PAL permit. However, the PAL effective date for an increased PAL is the date any emissions unit that is part of the PAL major modification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant. (vii)(g) \"PAL effective period \" means the period beginning with the PAL effective date and ending ten (10) years later. 123 (viii) (h) \"PAL major modification \" means, notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(B)(30) and (b)(B)(34) (the definitions for major modification and net emissions incr ease), any physical change in or change in the method of operation of the PAL source that causes it to emit the PAL pollutant at a level equal to or greater than the PAL. (ix)(i) \"PAL permit \" means the major NSR permit, the minor NSR permit, or the stat e operating permit under Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II .(G), or the Title V permit issued by the Department that establishes a PAL for a major stationary source. (x)(j) \"PAL pollutant \" means the pollutant for which a PAL is established at a major statio nary source. (xi)(k) \"Significant emissions unit \" means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit a PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal to or greater than the significant level (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(49) or in the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower) for that PAL pollutant, but less than the amount that would qualify the unit as a major emissions unit as defined in paragraph (aa)(2)(iv) (AA)(2)(d) . (3) Permit application requirements. As part of a permit application requestin g a PAL, the owner or operator of a major stationary source shall submit the following information to the Department for approval: (i)(a) A list of all emissions units at the source designated as small, significant or major based on their potential to e mit. In addition, the owner or operator of the source shall indicate which, if any, federal or state applicable requirements, emission limitations, or work practices apply to each unit. (ii)(b) Calculations of the baseline actual emissions (with support ing documentation). Baseline actual emissions are to include emissions associated not only with operation of the unit, but also emissions associated with startup, shutdown, and malfunction. (iii)(c) The calculation procedures that the major stationary s ource owner or operator proposes to use to convert the monitoring system data to monthly emissions and annual emissions based on a twelve (12)-month rolling total for each month as required by paragraph (aa)(13)(i) (AA)(13)(a) . (4) General requirements fo r establishing PALs. (i)(a) The Department is allowed to establish a PAL at a major stationary source, provided that at a minimum, the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(4)(i)(a) (AA)(4)(a)(i) through (aa)(4)(i)(g) (AA)(4)(a)(vii) are met. (a)(i) The PAL shall impose an annual emission limitation in tpy tons per year , that is enforceable as a practical matter, for the entire major stationary source. For each month during the PAL effective period after the first twelve (12) months of establishing a PAL, the major stationary source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the monthly emissions from each emissions unit under the PAL for the previous twelve (12) consecutive months is less than the PAL (a twelve ( 12)-month average, rolled monthly). For each month during the first eleven (11) months from the PAL effective date, the major stationary source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the preceding monthly emissions from the PAL effective date for each emissions unit under the PAL is le ss than the PAL. (b)(ii) The PAL shall be established in a PAL permit that meets the public participation requirements in paragraph (aa)(AA) (5). (c)(iii) The PAL permit shall contain all the requirements of paragraph (aa)(AA) (7). 124 (d)(iv) The PAL shall include fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, from all emissions units that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL pollutant at the major stationary source. (e)(v) Each PAL shall regulate emissions of only one pollutant. (f)(vi) Each PAL shall have a PAL effective period of ten (10) years. (g)(vii) The owner or operator of the major stationary source with a PAL shall comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements provided in paragraphs (aa)(AA) (12) through (aa)(AA) (14) for each emissions unit under the PAL through the PAL effective period. (ii)(b) At no time (during or after the PAL effective period) are emissions reductions of a PAL pollutant that occur during the PAL effective period credit able as decreases for purposes of offsets under 40 CFR 51.165(a)(3)(ii) unless the level of the PAL is reduced by the amount of such emissions reductions and such reductions would be creditable in the absence of the PAL. (5) Public participation requirem ents for PALs. PALs for existing major stationary sources shall be established, renewed, or increased through a procedure that is consistent with section Section (q)(Q) \"Public Participation\" of this regulation. This includes the requirement that the Depart ment provide the public with notice of the proposed approval of a PAL permit and at least a thirty (30) -day period for submittal of public comment. The Department must address all material comments before taking final action on the permit. (6) Setting th e 10-year actuals PAL level. (i)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (aa)(6)(ii) (AA)(6)(b) , the actuals PAL level for a major stationary source shall be established as the sum of the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (b)(B)(4)) of the PA L pollutant for each emissions unit at the source; plus an amount equal to the applicable significant level for the PAL pollutant under paragraph (b)(B)(49) or under the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower. When establishing the actuals PAL level, for a PAL pollutant, only one consecutive twenty -four (24)-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for all existing emissions units. However, a different consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period may be used for each different PAL pollutant. Emissions associated with units that were permanently shut down after this twenty -four (24)-month period must be subtracted from the PAL level. The Department shall specify a reduced PAL level(s) (in tpy tons per year ) in the PAL permit to become effective on the future compliance date(s) of any applicable federal or state regulatory requirement(s) that the Department is aware of prior to the issuanc e of the PAL permit. For instance, if the source owner or operator will be required to reduce emissions from industrial boilers in half from baseline emissions of sixty (60) parts per million (ppm) NO X to a new rule limit of thirty (30) ppm, then the permi t shall contain a future effective PAL level that is equal to the current PAL level reduced by half of the original baseline emissions of such unit(s). (ii)(b) For newly constructed units (which do not include modification to existing units) on which actual construction began after the twenty -four ( 24)-month period, the emissions must be added to the PAL level in an amount equal to the potential to emit of the units. (7) Contents of the PAL permit. The PAL permit must contain, at a minimum, the informa tion in paragraphs (aa)(7)(i) (AA)(7)(a) through (aa)(7)(x) (AA)(7)(j) The PAL pollutant and the applicable source -wide emission limitation in tpy tons per year . (ii)(b) The PAL permit effective date and the expiration date of the PAL (PAL effe ctive period). 125 (iii)(c) Specification in the PAL permit that if a major stationary source owner or operator applies to renew a PAL in accordance with paragraph (aa)(AA) (10) before the end of the PAL effective period, then the PAL shall not expire at the end of the PAL effective period. It shall remain in effect until a revised PAL permit is issued by the Department. (iv)(d) A requirement that emission calculations for compliance purposes must include emissions from startups, shutdowns, and malfunction s. (v)(e) A requirement that, once the PAL expires, the major stationary source is subject to the requirements of paragraph (aa)(AA) (9). (vi)(f) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source owner or operator shall use to convert the mo nitoring system data to monthly emissions and annual emissions based on a twelve (12)-month rolling total as required by paragraph (aa)(13)(i) (AA)(13)(a) . (vii)(g) A requirement that the major stationary source owner or operator monitor all emissions units in accordance with the provisions under paragraph (aa)(AA) (12). (viii) (h) A requirement to retain the records required under paragraph (aa)(AA) (13) on site. Su ch records may be retained in an electronic format. (ix)(i) A requirement to submit the reports required under paragraph (aa)(AA) (14) by the required deadlines. (x)(j) Any other requirements that the Department deems necessary to implement and enforc e the PAL. (8) PAL effective period and reopening of the PAL permit. The requirements in paragraphs (aa)(8)(i) (AA)(8)(a) and (aa)(8)(ii) (AA)(8)(b) apply to actuals PALs. (i)(a) PAL effective period. The Department shall specify a PAL effective period of ten (10) years. (ii)(b) Reopening of the PAL permit. (a)(i) During the PAL effective period, the Department must reopen the PAL permit to: (1) Correct typographical/calculation errors made in setting the PAL or reflect a more accurate determ ination of emissions used to establish the PAL; (2) Reduce the PAL if the owner or operator of the major stationary source creates creditable emissions reductions for use as offsets under 40 CFR 51.165(a)(3)(ii); and (3) Revise the PAL to reflect an increase in the PAL as provided under paragraph (aa)(AA) (11). (b)(ii) The Department shall have discretion to reopen the PAL permit for the following: (1) Reduce the PAL to reflect newly applicable federal requirem ents (for example, NSPS) with compliance dates after the PAL effective date; 126 (2) Reduce the PAL consistent with any other requirement, that is enforceable as a practical matter, and that the state may impose on the major stationary source under the St ate Implementation Plan; and (3) Reduce the PAL if the Department determines that a reduction is necessary to avoid causing or contributing to a National Ambient Air Quality Standard or PSD increment violation, or to an adverse impact on an air qualit y related value that has been identified for a Class I area by a Federal Land Manager and for which information is available to the general public. (c)(iii) Except for the permit reopening in paragraph (aa)(8)(ii)(a)(1) (AA)(8)(b)(i)(1) for the correcti on of typographical/calculation errors that do not increase the PAL level, all other reopenings shall be carried out in accordance with the public participation requirements of paragraph (aa)(AA) (5). (9) Expiration of a PAL. Any PAL that is not renewed i n accordance with the procedures in paragraph (aa)(10) (AA)(10) shall expire at the end of the PAL effective period, and the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(9)(i) (AA)(9)(a) through (aa)(9)(v) (AA)(9)(e) shall apply. (i)(a) Each emissions unit (or each gro up of emissions units) that existed under the PAL shall comply with an allowable emission limitation under a revised permit established according to the procedures in paragraphs (aa)(9)(i)(a) (AA)(9)(a)(i) and (aa)(9)(i)(b) (AA)(9)(a)(ii) . (a)(i) Within the time specified for PAL renewals in paragraph (aa)(10)(ii) (AA)(10)(b) , the major stationary source shall submit a proposed allowable emission limitation for each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units, if such a distribution is m ore appropriate as decided by the Department) by distributing the PAL allowable emissions for the major stationary source among each of the emissions units that existed under the PAL. If the PAL had not yet been adjusted for an applicable requirement that became effective during the PAL effective period, as required under paragraph (aa)(10)(v) (AA)(10)(e) , such distribution shall be made as if the PAL had been adjusted. (b)(ii) The Department shall decide whether and how the PAL allowable emissions will be distributed and issue a revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of emissions units, as the Department determines is appropriate. (ii)(b) Each emissions unit(s) shall comply with the allowable emission limi tation on a twelve (12)-month rolling basis. The Department may approve the use of monitoring systems (source testing, emission factors, etc.) other than CEMS, CERMS, PEMS, or CPMS to demonstrate compliance with the allowable emission limitation. (iii)(c) Until the Department issues the revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emissions unit, or each group of emissions units, as required under paragraph (aa)(9)(i)(b) (AA)(9)(a)(ii) , the source shall continue to comply with a source -wide, mul ti-unit emissions cap equivalent to the level of the PAL emission limitation. (iv)(d) Any physical change or change in the method of operation at the major stationary source will be subject to major NSR requirements if such change meets the definition of major modification in paragraph (b)(B)(30). (v)(e) The major stationary source owne r or operator shall continue to comply with any state or federal applicable requirements (BACT, RACT, NSPS, etc.) that may have applied either during the PAL effective period or prior to the PAL effective period except for those emission limitations that h ad been established 127 pursuant to paragraph (r)(R)(4), but were eliminated by the PAL in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (aa)(1)(ii)(c) (AA)(1)(b)(iii) . (10) Renewal of a PAL. (i)(a) The Department shall follow the procedures specified in par agraph (aa)(AA) (5) in approving any request to renew a PAL for a major stationary source, and shall provide both the proposed PAL level and a written rationale for the proposed PAL level to the public for review and comment. During such public review, any person may propose a PAL level for the source for consideration by the Department. (ii)(b) Application deadline. A major stationary source owner or operator shall submit a timely application to the Department to request renewal of a PAL. A timely applic ation is one that is submitted at least six (6) months prior to, but not earlier than eighteen (18) months from, the date of permit expiration. This deadline for application submittal is to ensure that the permit will not expire before the permit is renewe d. If the owner or operator of a major stationary source submits a complete application to renew the PAL within this time period, then the PAL shall continue to be effective until the revised permit with the renewed PAL is issued. (iii)(c) Application r equirements. The application to renew a PAL permit shall contain the information required in paragraphs (aa)(10)(iii)(a) (AA)(10)(c)(i) through (aa)(10)(iii)(d) (AA)(10)(c)(iv) . (AA)(3)(c) . (b)(ii) A proposed PAL level. (c)(iii) The sum of the potential to emit of all emissions units under the PAL (with supporting documentation). (d)(iv) Any other information the owner or operator wishes the Department to c onsider in determining the appropriate level for renewing the PAL. (iv)(d) PAL adjustment. In determining whether and how to adjust the PAL, the Department shall consider the options outlined in paragraphs (aa)(10)(iv)(a) (AA)(10)(d)(i) and (aa)(10)(iv)( b)(AA)(10)(d)(ii) . However, in no case may any such adjustment fail to comply with paragraph (aa)(10)(iv)(c) (AA)(10)(d)(iii) . (a)(i) If the emissions level calculated in accordance with paragraph (aa)(AA) (6) is equal to or greater than eighty (80) perc ent of the PAL level, the Department may renew the PAL at the same level without considering the factors set forth in paragraph (aa)(10)(iv)(b) (AA)(10)(d)(ii) ; or (b)(ii) The Department may set the PAL at a level that it determines to be more represent ative of the source's baseline actual emissions, or that it determines to be more appropriate considering air quality needs, advances in control technology, anticipated economic growth in the area, desire to reward or encourage the source's voluntary emiss ions reductions, or other factors as specifically identified by the Department in its written rationale. (c)(iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (aa)(10)(iv)(a) (AA)(10)(d)(i) and (aa)(10)(iv)(b) (AA)(10)(d)(ii) : (1) If the potential to emit of the major stationary source is less than the PAL, the Department shall adjust the PAL to a level no greater than the potential to emit of the source; and 128 (2) The Department shall not approve a renewed PAL level higher than the current PAL, unless the majo r stationary source has complied with the provisions of paragraph (aa)(AA) (11) (increasing a PAL). (v)(e) If the compliance date for a state or federal requirement that applies to the PAL source occurs during the PAL effective period, and if the Departm ent has not already adjusted for such requirement, the PAL shall be adjusted at the time of PAL permit renewal or Title V permit renewal, whichever occurs first. (11) Increasing a PAL during the PAL effective period. (i)(a) The Department may increase a PAL emission limitation only if the major stationary source complies with the provisions in paragraphs (aa)(11)(i)(a) (AA)(11)(a)(i) through (aa)(11)(i)(d) (AA)(11)(a)(iv) . (a)(i) The owner or operator of the major stationary source shall submit a com plete application to request an increase in the PAL limit for a PAL major modification. Such application shall identify the emissions unit(s) contributing to the increase in emissions so as to cause the major stationary source's emissions to equal or excee d its PAL. (b)(ii) As part of this application, the major stationary source owner or operator shall demonstrate that the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units assuming application of BACT equivalent controls, plus the sum of the allowable emissions of the new or modified emissions unit(s) exceeds the PAL. The level of control that would result from BACT equivalent controls on each sign ificant or major emissions unit shall be determined by conducting a new BACT analysis at the time the application is submitted, unless the emissions unit is currently required to comply with a BACT or LAER requirement that was established within the preced ing ten (10) years. In such a case, the assumed control level for that emissions unit shall be equal to the level of BACT or LAER with which that emissions unit must currently comply. (c)(iii) The owner or operator obtains a major NSR permit for all emissions unit(s) identified in paragraph (aa)(11)(i)(a) (AA)(11)(a)(i) , regardless of the magnitude of the emissions increase resulting from them (that is, no significant levels apply). These emissi ons unit(s) shall comply with any emissions requirements resulting from the major NSR process (for example, BACT), even though they have also become subject to the PAL or continue to be subject to the PAL. (d)(iv) The PAL permit shall require that the increased PAL level shall be effective on the day any emissions unit that is part of the PAL major modification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant. (ii)(b) The Department shall calculate the new PAL as the sum of the allowable emis sions for each modified or new emissions unit, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units (assuming application of BACT equivalent controls as determined in accordance with paragraph (aa)(11)(i)(b) (AA)(11)(a) (ii)), plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units. (iii)(c) The PAL permit shall be revised to reflect the increased PAL level pursuant to the public notice requirements of paragraph (aa)(AA) (5). (12) Monitoring require ments for PALs. (i)(a) General requirements. 129 (a)(i) Each PAL permit must contain enforceable requirements for the monitoring system that accurately determines plantwide emissions of the PAL pollutant in terms of mass per unit of time. Any monitoring system authorized for use in the PAL permit must be based on sound science and meet generally acceptable scientific procedures for data quality and manipulation. Additionally, the information generated by such system must meet minimum legal requirements for admissibility in a judicial proceeding to enforce the P AL permit. (b)(ii) The PAL monitoring system must employ one or more of the four general monitoring approaches meeting the minimum requirements set forth in paragraphs (aa)(12)(ii)(a) (AA)(12)(b)(i) through (aa)12(ii)(d) (AA)(12)(b)(iv) and must be appro the Department. (c)(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (aa)(12)(i)(b) (AA)(12)(a)(ii) , the owner or operator may also employ an alternative monitoring approach that meets paragraph (aa)(12)(i)(a) (AA)(12)(a)(i) if approved by the Department. (d)(iv) Failure to use a monitoring system that meets the requirements of this regulation renders the PAL invalid. (ii)(b) Minimum performance requirements for approved monitoring approaches. The following are acceptable general monitoring approaches when co nducted in accordance with the minimum requirements in paragraphs (aa)(12)(iii) (AA)(12)(c) through (aa)(12)(ix) (AA)(12)(b)(i) : (a)(i) Mass balance solvents; (b)(ii) CEMS; (c)(iii) CPMS or PEMS; and (d)(iv) Emission factors. (iii)(c) Mass balance calculations. An owner or operator using mass balance calculations to monitor PAL pollutant emissions from activities using coating or solvents shall meet the following requirements: (a)(i) Provide a demonstrated means of validating the published content of the PAL pollutant that is contained in or created by all materials used in or at the emissions unit; (b)(ii) Assume that the emissions unit emits all of the PAL pollutant that is cont ained in or created by any raw material or fuel used in or at the emissions unit, if it cannot otherwise be accounted for in the process; and (c)(iii) Where the vendor of a material or fuel, which is used in or at the emissions unit, publishes a range of pollutant content from such material, the owner or operator must use the highest value of the range to calculate the PAL pollutant emissions unless the Department determines there is site -specific data or a site-specific monitoring program to support another content within the range. (iv)(d) CEMS. An owner or operator using CEMS to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: (a)(i) CEMS must comply with applicable Performance Specifications found in 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix B; and 130 (b)(ii) CEMS must sample, analyze and record data at least every fifteen (15) minutes while the emissions unit is operating. (v)(e) CPMS or PEMS. An owner or operator using CPMS or PEMS to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: (a)(i) The CPMS or the PEMS must be based on current site -specific data demonstrating a correlation between the monitored parame ter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions across the range of operation of the emissions unit; and (b)(ii) Each CPMS or PEMS must sample, analyze, and record data at least every fifteen (15) minutes, or at another less frequent interval approved by the De partment, while the emissions unit is operating. (vi)(f) Emission factors. An owner or operator using emission factors to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: (a)(i) All emission factors shall be adjusted, if approp riate, to account for the degree of uncertainty or limitations in the factors' development; (b)(ii) The emissions unit shall operate within the designated range of use for the emission factor, if applicable; and (c)(iii) If technically practicable, the owner or operator of a significant emissions unit that relies on an emission factor to calculate PAL pollutant emissions shall conduct validation testing to determine a site-specific emission factor within six (6) months of PAL permit issuance, unless the Department determines that testing is not required. (vii)(g) A source owner or operator must record and report maximum potential emissions without considering enforceable emission limitations or operational restrictions for an emissions unit during any period of time that there is no monitoring data, unless another method for determining emissions during such periods is specified in the PAL permit. (viii) (h) Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(12)(iii) (AA)(12)(c) through (aa)(12)( vii)(AA)(12)(g) , where an owner or operator of an emissions unit cannot demonstrate a correlation between the monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions rate at all operating points of the emissions unit, the Department shall, at the time of pe rmit issuance: (a)(i) Establish default value(s) for determining compliance with the PAL based on the highest potential emissions reasonably estimated at such operating point(s); or (b)(ii) Determine that operation of the emissions unit during operating conditions when there is no correlation between monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions is a violation of the PAL. (ix)(i) Re-validation. All data used to establish the PAL pollutant must be re -validated through performance testing or other scientifically valid means approved by the Department. Such testing must occur at least once every five ( 5) years after issuance of the PAL. (13) Recordkeeping requirements . 131 (i)(a) The PAL permit shall require an owner or operator to retain a copy of all records necessary to determine compliance with any requirement of paragraph (aa) Section (AA) and of the PAL, including a determination of each emissions unit's twelve ( 12)-month ro lling total emissions, for five (5) years from the date of such record. (ii)(b) The PAL permit shall require an owner or operator to retain a copy of the following records for the duration of the PAL effective period plus five (5) years: (a)(i) A co py of the PAL permit application and any applications for revisions to the PAL; and (b)(ii) Each annual certification of compliance pursuant to Title V and the data relied on in certifying the compliance. (14) Reporting and notification requirements . The owner or operator shall submit semi -annual monitoring reports and prompt deviation reports to the Department in accordance with the applicable title V operating permit program Regulation 61 -62.70 . The reports shall meet the requirements in (AA)(14)(a) through (aa)(14)(iii) (AA)(14)(c) . (i)(a) Semi -annual report. The semi -annual report shall be submitted to the Department within 30 days of the end of each reporting period.

(ii)(b) Deviation report. The major stationary source owner or operator shall promptly submit rep orts of any deviations or exceedance of the PAL requirements, including periods where no monitoring is available. A report submitted pursuant to 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B) shall satisfy this reporting requirement. The deviation reports shall be submitted wi thin the time limits prescribed by the applicable program implementing 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(B).

(iii)(c) Re-validation results. The owner or operator shall submit to the Department the results of any re-validation test or method within thre e (3) months after completion of such test or method. (15) Transition requirements. (i)(a) The Department may not issue a PAL that does not comply with the requirements in paragraphs (aa)(AA) (1) through (aa)(AA) (15) after the date these provisions bec ome effective. (ii)(b) The Department may supersede any PAL that was established prior to the date these provisions become effective with a PAL that complies with the requirements of paragraphs (aa)(AA) (1) through (aa)(AA) (15). (bb)(BB) If any provision of this regulation, or the application of such provision to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remainder of this regulation, or the application of such provision to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, shall not be affected thereby. 61-62.5. Standard No. 7.1. Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR) (a)(A) Applicability . (1) This rule applies to all major stationary sources constructed or modified in any nonattainment area as designated in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 81.341 (\"nonattainment area\") if the emissions from such facility will cause or contribute to conc entrations of a regulated NSR pollutant (as defined in paragraph (c)(13) (B)(32) ) for which the nonattainment area was designated as nonattainment. Applicability to this regulation shall be based on the pollutant emission rate set out in paragraph (c)(14) (B)(37) for only those pollutants for which the area's designation is based. (A)(a) The requirements of paragraph (d) this regulation apply to the construction of any new major stationary source or the major modification of any existing major stationary s ource, except as provided in paragraph (b) Section(A)(10) . (B)(b) No new major stationary source or major modification to which the requirements of paragraph (d) this regulation apply shall begin actual construction without a permit that states that the major stationary source or major modification will meet those requirements. The Department has authority to issue any such permit. (2) Redesignation to attainment . If any nonattainment area to which this regulation applies is later designated in 40 CFR 81.341 as attainment, all sources in that nonattainment area subject to this regulation before the redesignation date shall continue to comply with this regulation. 133 (3) For any area designated as nonattainment a major stationary source or major modificat ion that is major for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or oxides of nitrogen oxides is also major for ozone. (b) Applicability procedures. (1)(4) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph s (b)(7) and (8) (A)(9) , and consistent with the definition of major modification contained as defined in paragraph (c)(6)(A) (B)(21)(a) , a project is a major modification for a regulated NSR pollutant if it causes two types of emissions increases - a significant emissions increase (as defined in paragraph (c)(15) (B)(3 8), and a significant net emissions increase (as defined in paragraphs (c)(8) (B)(24) and (15)(B)(37) ). The project is not a major modification if it does not cause a significant emissions increase. If the project causes a significant emissions increase, th en the project is a major modification only if it also results in a significant net emissions increase. (2)(5) The procedure for calculating , (before beginning actual construction ), whether a significant emissions increase (the first step of the process) will occur depends upon the type of emissions units being modified, according to paragraphs (b)(1) (A)(6) through (6)(A)(8) . The procedure for calculating , (before beginning actual construction ), whether a significant net emissions increase will occur at t he major stationary source (the second step of the process) is contained in the definition in paragraph (c)(8) (B)(24) . Regardless of any such preconstruction projections, a major modification results if the project causes a significant emissions increase a nd a significant net emissions increase. (3)(6) Actual -to-projected -actual applicability test for projects that only involve existing emissions units . A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the difference between the projected actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (c)(11) (B)(31) ) and the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraphs (c)(2)(A) (B)(3)(a) and (B)(B)(3)(b), as applicable), for each existing emissions unit, equals or exceeds t he significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (c)(14) (B)(37) ). (4)(7) Actual -to-potential test for projects that only involve construction of a new emissions unit(s) . A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is pr ojected to occur if the sum of the difference between the potential to emit (as defined in paragraph (b)(37) of Regulation 61 -62.5 Standard 7, \"Prevention of Significant Deterioration \" (\"Standard 7\") (B)(27) ) from each new emissions unit following completion of the project and the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(C) (B)(3)(c) ) of these units before the project equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (c)(14) (B)(37) ). (5) [Reserved] (6)(8) Hybrid test for projects that involve multiple types of emissions units . A significant emissions increase of a regulated NSR pollutant is projected to occur if the sum of the emissions increases for each emissions unit, using the method specified in paragraphs (b)(3) (A)(6) and (4)(A)(7) as applicable with respect to each emiss ions unit, for each type of emissions unit equals or exceeds the significant amount for that pollutant (as defined in paragraph (c)(14) (B)(37) ). (7)(9) For any major stationary source for a Plantwide Applicability Limitation (PAL) for a regulated NSR po llutant, the major stationary source shall comply with requirements under paragraph Section (i)(N). (10) The provisions of this section shall not apply to a particular major stationary source or major modification if the source or modification would be a major stationary source or major modification only if fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, are considered in calculating the potential to emit of the stationary source or modification and the source does not belong to any of the following catego ries: 134 (a) Coal cleaning plants (with thermal dryers); (b) Kraft pulp mills; (c) Portland cement plants; (d) Primary zinc smelters; (e) Iron and steel mills; (f) Primary aluminum ore reduction plants; (g) Primary copper smelters; (h) Municipal incinerators capable of charging more than 250 tons of refuse per day; (i) Hydrofluoric, sulfuric, or nitric acid plants; (j) Petroleum refineries; (k) Lime plants; (l) Phosphate rock processing plants; (m) Coke oven batteries; (n) Sulfur recovery plants; (o) Carbon black plants (furnace process); (p) Primary lead smelters; (q) Fuel conversion plants; (r) Sintering plants; (s) Secondary metal production plants; (t) Chemical process plants - The term chemical processing plant shall not include ethanol production facilities that produce ethanol by natural fermentation included in NAICS codes 325193 or 312140; (u) Fossil -fuel boilers (or combination thereof) totaling more than 250 million Br itish thermal units per hour heat input; (v) Petroleum storage and transfer units with a total storage capacity exceeding 300,000 barrels; (w) Taconite ore processing plants; (x) Glass fiber processing plants; 135 (y) Charcoal production plants; (z) Fossil fuel -fired steam electric plants of more than 250 million British thermal units per hour heat input; and (aa) Any other stationary source category which, as of August 7, 1980, is being regulated under Section 111 or 112 of the Clean Air Act. (c)(B) Definitions. The following definitions apply to this Standard only. Any other term contained within this Standard is as defined where indicated in Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard 7, Prevention of Significant Deterioration. For the purposes of this re gulation: (1)(A)(a) \"Actual emissions \" means the actual rate of emissions of a regulated NSR pollutant from an emissions unit, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1)(B) (B)(1)(b) through (D)(B)(1)(d) , except that this definition shall not appl y for calculating whether a significant emissions increase has occurred, or for establishing a PAL under paragraph Section (i)(N). Instead, paragraphs (c)(2) (B)(3) and (c)(11) (B)(31) shall apply for those purposes. (B)(b) In general, actual emissions as of a particular date shall equal the average rate, in tons per year (tpy) , at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during a consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period which precedes the particular date and which is representative of normal source operation. The Department shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. Actual emissions shall be calculated using the unit's actual operating hours, production rates, and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the selected time period. (C)(c) The Department may presume that source -specific allowable emissions for the unit are equivalent to the actual emissions of the unit. (D)(d) For any emissions unit that has not begun normal operations on the particular date, actual emissions shall equal the potential to emit of the unit on that date. (2) Allowable emissions means the emissions rate of a stationary source calculated using the maximum rated capacity of the source (unless the source is subject to federally enforceable limits which restrict the operating rate, or hours of operation, or both) and the most stringent of the following: (a) The applicable standards as set forth in 40 CFR Parts 60 and 61; (b) Any applicable State Implementation Plan emissions limitation, including those with a future compliance date; or (c) The emissions rate specified as a federally enforceable permit condition, including those with a future compliance date. (2)(3) \"Baseline actual emissions \" means the rate of emissions, in tpy tons per year , of a regulated NSR pollutant, as determined in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2)(A) (B)(3)(a) through (D)(B)(3)(d) . (A)(a) For any existing e lectric utility steam generating unit, baseline actual emissions means the average rate, in tpy tons per year , at which the unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period selected by the owner or operator within th e five ( 5)-year period immediately preceding when the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project. The 136 Department shall allow the use of a different time period upon a determination that it is more representative of normal source operation. (i) The average rate shall include fugitive emissions to the extent quantifiable, and emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (ii) The average rate shall be adjusted downward to exclude any non -compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above any emission limitation that was legally enforceable during the consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period. (iii) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple emissions units, only one consec utive twenty -four ( 24)-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for the emissions units being changed. A different consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period can be used for each regulated NSR pollutant. (iv) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual emissions, in tpy tons per year , and for adjusting this amount if required by paragraph (c)(2)(A)(ii) (B)(3)(a)(ii) . (B)(b) For an existing emissions unit (other than an electric utility steam generating unit), baseline actual emissions means the average rate, in tpy tons per year , at which the emissions unit actually emitted the pollutant during any consecutive twenty -four (24)-month period selected by the owner or operator within the ten (10)-year period immediately preceding either the date the owner or operator begins actual construction of the project, or the date a complete permit application is received by the Departm ent for a permit required either under this section or under a plan approved by the Administrator whichever is earlier, except that the ten ( 10)-year period shall not include any period earlier than November 15, 1990. The Department reserves the right to d etermine if the twenty -four ( 24)-month period selected is appropriate. (i) The average rate shall include fugitive emissions to the extent quantifiable, and emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (ii) The average rate shal l be adjusted downward to exclude any non -compliant emissions that occurred while the source was operating above an emission limitation that was legally enforceable during the consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period. (iii) The average rate shall be a djusted downward to exclude any emissions that would have exceeded an emission limitation with which the major stationary source must currently comply, had such major stationary source been required to comply with such limitations during the consecutive twenty-four (24)-month period. However, if an emission limitation is part of a maximum achievable control technology standard that the Administrator proposed or promulgated under 40 CFR Part 63, the baseline actual emissions need only be adjusted if the stat e has taken credit for such emissions reductions in an attainment demonstration or maintenance plan consistent with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1)(c)(viii) (D)(7) (iv) For a regulated NSR pollutant, when a project involves multiple emissions units , only one consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for the emissions units being changed. A different consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period can be used for each regulated NSR pollutant. (v) The average rate shall not be based on any consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period for which there is inadequate information for determining annual emissions, in tpy tons per year , and for adjusting this amount if required by paragraphs (c)(2)(B)(ii) (B)(3)(b)(ii) and (iii)(B)(3)(b)(iii) . 137 (C)(c) For a new emissions unit, the baseline actual emissions for purposes of determining the emissions increase that will result from the initial construction and operation of such unit shall equal zero; and thereafter, for all other purposes, shall equal the unit's potential to emit. (D)(d) For a PAL for a major stationary source, the baseline actual emissions shall be calculated for existing electric utility steam generating units in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (c)(2)(A) (B)(3)(a) , for other existing emissions units in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (c)(2)(B) (B)(3)(b) , and for a new emissions unit in accordance with the procedures contained in paragraph (c)(2)(C) (B)(3)(c) . (4) Begin actual construction means , in general, initiation of physical on -site construction activities on an emissions unit which are of a permanent nature. Such activities include, but are not limited to, installation of building supports and foundations, laying of underground pipework, a nd construction of permanent storage structures. With respect to a change in method of operating this term refers to those on -site activities other than preparatory activities which mark the initiation of the change. (3)(5) \"Best available control techno logy (BACT) \" means an emissions limitation (including a visible emissions standard) based on the maximum degree of reduction for each regulated NSR pollutant which would be emitted from any proposed major stationary source or major modification which the D epartment, on a case -by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such source or modification through application of production processes or available methods, systems, and tec hniques, including fuel cleaning or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of such pollutant. In no event shall application of best available control technology result in emissions of any pollutant which would exceed the emissions a llowed by any applicable standard under 40 CFR Parts 60 or 61. If the Department determines that technological or economic limitations on the application of measurement methodology to a particular emissions unit would make the imposition of an emissions st andard infeasible, a design, equipment, work practice, operational standard, or combination thereof, may be prescribed instead to satisfy the requirement for the application of BACT. Such standard shall, to the degree possible, set forth the emissions redu ction achievable by implementation of such design, equipment, work practice or operation, and shall provide for compliance by means which achieve equivalent results. (4) [Reserved] (6)(a) Building, structure, facility, or installation means all of the pollutant -emitting activities which belong to the same industrial grouping, are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common control) except the activities of any vessel. Po llutant -emitting activities shall be considered as part of the same industrial grouping if they belong to the same \"Major Group\" (which have the same two -digit code) as described in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1972, as amended by the 197 7 Supplement (U.S. Government Printing Office stock numbers 4101 -0066 and 003 -005-00176 -0, respectively). (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (B)(6)(a), building, structure, facility, or installation means, for onshore activities under Stand ard Industrial Classification (SIC) Major Group 13: Oil and Gas Extraction, all of the pollutant -emitting activities included in Major Group 13 that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person (or persons under common control). Pollutant emitting activities shall be considered adjacent if they are located on the same surface site; or if they are located on surface sites that are located within one -fourth (1/4) of a mile of one another (measured from the center of the equipment on the surface site) and they share equipment. Shared equipment includes, but is not limited to, produced fluids storage tanks, phase separators, natural gas 138 dehydrators, or emissions control devices. Surface site, as used in this paragraph, has the same meaning as in 40 CFR 63.761.

However, if a source is subject to this regulation on the basis of the direct emissions from the source, the applicable conditions in paragraph (C)(1) must also be met for secondary emissions. However, secondary emissions may be exempt from paragraphs (C)(1)(a) and (C)(1)(b) of this section. (4) The requirements of this regulation applicable to major stationary sources and major modifications of PM 10 shall also apply to major stationary sources and major modific ations of PM 10 precursors, except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels that exceed the PM 10 ambient standards in the area. 149 (D) Offset standards. (1) All emission reductions claimed as offset credit shall be perm anent, quantifi able, federally enforceable, and surplus; (i)(2) Where the permitted emissions limit allows greater emissions than the potential to emit of the source (as when a state has a single particulate emission limit for all fu els), emissions offset credit will be allowed only for control below this potential; (ii)(3) For an existing fuel combustion source, credit shall be based on the allowable emissions for the type of fuel being burned at the time the application to constru ct is filed. If the existing source commits to switch to a cleaner fuel at some future date, emission s offset credit based on the allowable (or actual) emissions for the fuels involved is not acceptable, unless the permit is conditioned to require the use of a specified alternative control measure which would achieve the same degree of emissions reduction should the source switch back to a dirtier fuel at some later date. (iii)(a) (4) Emissions reductions achieved by shutting down an existing source or cur tailing production or operating hours below baseline levels may be generally credited if such reductions are permanent, quantifiable, federally enforceable, occurred on or after the date of the most recent emissions inventory, and if the area has an EPA -approved attainment plan. for offsets if the shutdown or curtailment occurred after the last day of the base year for the SIP planning process. For purposes of this paragra ph, the Department may choose to consider a prior shutdown or curtailment to have occurred after the last day of the base year if the projected emissions inventory used to develop the attainment demonstrati on explicitly includes the emissions from such previously shutdown or curtailed emission units. No credit may be given f or shutdowns that occurred before August 7, 1977. (b)(5) Such reductions may be credited if Emiss ions redu ctions ach ieved by shutting down an existing emiss ions unit or curtailing production or operating hours and that do not meet the requir ements in paragraph (D)(4 ) may be generally credited only if: (a) the The shutdown or curtailment occurred on or after the date the new source permit application is filed,; or, (b) if the The applicant can establish that the proposed new source is a replacement for the shutdow n or curtailed source, and the cutoff date provision of paragraph (d)(C)(iii)(a) are observed emission reductions achieved by the shutdown or curtailment met the requirements of paragraph (D)(4) . (iv)(6) No emissions credit may be allowed for replacing one hydrocarbon compound with another of lesser reactivity, except for those compounds listed in Table 1 of EPA's \"Recommended Policy on Control of Volatile Organic Compounds\" (42 FR 35314, July 8, 1977); (v) All emission reductions claimed as offset credit shall be federally enforceable and surplus; (7) Credit for an emissions reduction can be claimed to the extent that the Department has not relied on it in issuing any permit under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart I or the Department has not relied on it in demonstrating attainment or reasonable further progress. (8) The total tonnage of increased emissions, in tons per year, resulting from a major modification that must be off set in accordance with Section 173 of the Clean Air Act shall be determined by summing the difference between the allowable emissions after the modification (as defined by paragraph (B)(2)) and the actual emissions before the modification (as defined in pa ragraph (B)(1)) for each emissions unit. 150 (9) If a designated nonattainment area is projected to be an attainment area as part of an approved SIP control strategy by the new source start -up date, offsets would not be required if the new source would not cause a new violation. (a)(10) Eligibility as Emission Offsets . Any facility that has the potential to emit any NAAQS pollutant in an amount greater than five ( 5) tpy tons per year and that is located in a federally -designated nonattainment area shall be eligible to create emission offsets . (1) To be eligible to be an emission offset: (A) A reduction in emissions shall be permanent, quantifiable, enforceable, and surplus and must have occurred after December 31 of the base year inventory for thos e pollutants that are designated nonattainment by the EPA. The base year inventory date is two years preceding the date of nonattainment designation. However, the Department may choose to consider a prior shutdown or curtailment to have occurred after the last day of the base year if the projected emissions inventory used to develop the attainment demonstration explicitly includes the emissions from such previously shutdown or curtailed emission units. (B)(11) Emission reductions shall have been created b y an existing facility that has obtained an enforceable air quality permit or letter of permit cancellation resulting from the surrender of the source's permit(s). (2)(12) Emission reductions may be created by any of, or a combination of , the following methods: (A)(a) Installation of control equipment beyond what is necessary to comply with existing requirements; (B)(b) A change in process inputs, formulations, products or product mix, fuels, or raw materials; (C)(c) A reduction i n actual emission rates; or (D) A reduction in hours of operation; (E) Production curtailment or reduction in throughput; (F) Shutdown of emitting sources; or (G)(d) Any other enforceable method that the Department determines to result in real, permanent, quantifiable, federally enforceable, and surplus reduction of emissions. (3)(13) A completed emissions offset submittal must be received by the Department within one (1) year of the date of the creation of the reductions. Emission offsets not requested within one (1) year of the date of the creation of the reductions will be permanently retired. Prior to commencing operation of a permitted emissions unit, Department approv al for the required emission offsets must be granted. (4)(14) The following emission reductions that are not considered surplus, are ineligible for emission offsets: (A) Emission reductions that are not considered surplus, such as: 151 (i)(a) Emission reductions that have previously been used to avoid Regulation 61 -62.5 Standard No. 7, Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or Regulation 61 -62.5 Standard No. 7.1, Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR), through a netting demonstration; (ii)(b) Emissi on reductions of hazardous air pollutants, listed in Section 112(b) of the Clean Air Act, to the extent needed to comply with Regulation 61 -62.61, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), and Regulation 61 -62.63, National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Source Categories , (however . However , emission reductions of hazardous volatile organic compound (VOC) and/or hazardous particulate matter (PM) air pollutants beyond the amount of reductions necessary to comply with Regulation 61 -62.61, NESHAP, and Regulation 61 -62.63, NESHAP for Source Categories, are considered surplus ); (iii)(c) Emission reductions of nitrogen oxides (NO X), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), particulate matter (PM) , and VOCs to the extent needed to comply with Section 111 of the CAA Clean Air Act and Regulation 61-62.60, S outh Carolina Designated Facility Plan and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) , (however . However , emission reductions of VOCs, NO X, SO 2, PM , and VOCs beyond the amount of reductions necessary to comply with Regulation 61 -62.60, S outh Carolina Designated Facility Plan and NSPS , are considered surplus ); (iv)(d) Emission reductions from emission units covered under an agreement, order , or variance for exceeding an emission s tandard until compliance is demonstrated with the emission standard that is the subject of the agreement, order or variance; (v)(e) Sources Emission reductions from sources that have operated less than twelve ( 12) months; (vi)(f) Emission reductions required in order to comply with any state or federal regulation not listed above, unless these reductions are in excess of the amount required by the state or federal regulation; or and (vii)(g) Facilities Emission reductions from facilities that have received a Department transmittal letter notifying with notification of permit cancellation due to the facility's decision to close out its operating permit without a request to qualify facility emission reductions as offsets. (E) (b) Calculation of Emission Offsets (1) The following procedure shall be used to calculate emission offsets: (A)(a) The source shall calculate average annual actual emissions, in tpy tons per year , before the emission reduction using data from the twenty -four ( 24)-month period immediately preceding the reduction in emissions. With the Department's approval, the use of a different time period, not to exceed ten ( 10) years immediately preceding the reduction in emissions, may be allowed if the owner or oper ator of the source documents that such period is more representative of normal source operation, but not prior to the base year inventory date, which is the last day of the two (2) years preceding the date of nonattainment designation; and (B)(b) The emission offsets created shall be calculated by subtracting the allowable emissions following the reduction from the average annual actual emissions prior to the reduction. (2) For any emissions unit that has been operating for a consecutive period of at least twelve ( 12) months but less than twenty -four ( 24) months on the base year inventory date, based on the unit's potential to emit, emissions shall be calculated equal to the amount needed to complete a twenty -four ( 24)-month period on the base ye ar inventory date. 152 (F) (vi) Location of offsetting emissions. Emission offsets shall be obtained from sources currently operating within the same designated nonattainment area as the new or modified stationary source. Emission offsets may be obtained from another nonattainment area with the Department's approval only if : (a) the other area has an equal or higher nonattainment classification than the area in which the proposed source is located and (b) emissions from the other area contribute to a violation of the NAAQS in the nonattainment area in which the source is located. (1) The other area has an equal or higher nonattainment classification than the area in which the proposed source is located, and (2) Emissions from the other area contribute to a violation of the NAAQS in the nonattainment area in which the source is located. (G) (vii) Emission offsetting ratios . Emission offsets shall be required in nonattainment areas in accordance with the following provisions: (a)(1) Emissions for carbon mon oxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), lead (Pb), and particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5) nonattainment areas shall be offset at a ratio greater than one to one. (b)(2) Emissions increases for ozone nonattainment areas shall be offset for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and NO X in accordance with the following table: Designation Offset ratios Subpart I >1 to 1 Marginal 1.1 to 1 Moderate 1.15 to 1 Serious 1.2 to 1 Severe 1.3 to 1 Extreme 1.5 to 1 (viii) Credit for an emissions reduction can be claimed to the extent that the Department has not relied on it in issuing any permit under regulations approved pursuant to 40 CFR Part 51 Subpart I or the Department has not relied on it in demonstrating attainment or reasonable further progress. (ix) [Reserved] (x) [Reserved] (xi) The total tonnage of increased emissions, in tpy, resulting from a major modification that must be offset in accordance with section 173 of the Clean Air Act shall be determined by summing the difference between the allowable emissions after the modification (as defined by paragraph (b)(3) of Standard 7) and the actual emissions before the modification (as defined in paragraph (c)(1)) for each emissions unit. (D) The emission offsets must provide a positive net air quality benefit in the affected area as determined by 40 CFR 51, Appendix S, Emission Offset Interpretative Ruling . (E) Alternative Sites Analysis. An analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and environmental control techniques for such proposed source demonstrates that benefits of the proposed 153 source significantly outweigh the environmental and soci al costs imposed as a result of its location, construction, or modification shall be required. (H) Interpollutant offsetting. (1) In meeting the emissions offset requirements of Section (D) the emissions offsets obtained shall be for the same regulated NSR pollutant unless interpollutant offsetting is permitted for a particular pollutant as specified in this paragraph. (a) The offset requirement(s) of Section (D) for emissions of the ozone precursors NO X and VOC may be satisfied by offsetting reductio ns of emissions of either of those precursors, if all other requirements for such offsets are also satisfied. (b) The offset requirements of Section (D) for direct PM 2.5 emissions or emissions of precursors of PM 2.5 may be satisfied by offsetting reduct ions of direct PM 2.5 emissions or emissions of any PM 2.5 precursor identified under paragraph (B)(32)(c) if such offsets comply with the interprecursor trading hierarchy and ratio established in the approved plan for a particular nonattainment area. (2) The control requirements applicable to major stationary sources and major modifications of PM 2.5 shall also apply to major stationary sources and major modifications of PM 2.5 precursors in a PM 2.5 nonattainment area, except that the Department may exempt n ew major stationary sources and major modifications of a particular precursor from the requirements for PM 2.5 if the nonattainment NSR precursor demonstration submitted to and approved by the Administrator shows that such sources do not contribute signific antly to PM 2.5 levels that exceed the standard in the area. Any demonstration submitted for the Administrator's review must meet the conditions for a nonattainment NSR precursor demonstration as set forth in 40 CFR 51.1006(a)(3). (I) Banking of emission o ffsets. For new sources obtaining permits by applying offsets after January 16, 1979, the Department may allow offsets that exceed the requirement of reasonable progress toward attainment to be \"banked\" (i.e., saved to provide offsets for a source seeking a permit in the future) for future use. Likewise, the Department may allow the owner of an existing source that reduces its own emissions to bank any resulting reductions beyond those required by the State Implementation Plan for future use. (J) [Reserved ] (K) [Reserved] (L) Source obligation. (2)(A) (1) Any owner or operator who constructs or operates a source or modification not in accordance with the application submitted pursuant to this section or with the terms of any approval to construct, or any owner or operator of a source or modification subject to this section who commences construction after the effective date of these regulations without applying for and receiving approval hereunder, shall be subject to appropriate enforcement action. (B)(2) Approval to construct shall become invalid if construction is not commenced within eighteen ( 18) months after receipt of such approval, if construction is discontinued for a period of eighteen ( 18) months or more, or if construction is not completed within a reasonable time. The Department may extend the eighteen ( 18)-month period upon a satisfactory showing that an extension is justified. This provision does not apply to the time period between con struction of the approved phases of a phased construction project; 154 each phase must commence construction within eighteen ( 18) months of the projected and approved commencement date. (C)(3) Approval to construct shall not relieve any owner or operator of the responsibility to comply fully with applicable provisions of the plan State Implementation Plan and any other requirements under local, state, or federal law. (D)(4) At such time that a particular source or modification becomes a major stationary sou rce or major modification solely by virtue of a relaxation in any enforcement limitation which was established after August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the source or modification otherwise to emit a pollutant, such as a restriction on hours of operation, t hen the requirements of regulations approved pursuant to this section shall apply to the source or modification as though construction had not yet commenced on the source or modification; (3)(5) Monitoring, Recordkeeping, and Reporting. The following pro visions apply to with respect to any regulated NSR pollutant emitted from projects at existing emissions units at a major stationary source (other than projects at a source with a PAL) in circumstances where there is a reasonable possibility that a project that is not a part of a major modification may result in a significant emissions increase of such pollutant, and the owner or operator elects to use the method specified in paragraphs (c)(11)(B)(i) (B)(31)(b)(i) through (iii)(B)(31)(b)(iii) for calculating projected actual emissions. (A)(a) If the project requires construction permitting under Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II \" Permit Requirements, \" the owner or operator shall provide a copy of the information set out in paragraph (d)(3)(B) (L)(5)(b) as part of the permit application to the Department. If construction permitting under Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II \" Permit Requirements, \" is not required, the owner or operator shall maintain the information set out in paragraph (d)(3) (L)(5) . (B)(b) Before beginning actual construction of the project, the owner or operator shall document and maintain a record of the following information: (i) A description of the project; (ii) Identification of the emissions unit(s) whose emissions of a regula ted NSR pollutant could be affected by the project; and (iii) A description of the applicability test used to determine that the project is not a major modification for any regulated NSR pollutant, including the baseline actual emissions, the projected actual emissions, the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (c)(11)(B)(iii) (B)(31)(b)(iii) and an explanation for why such amount was excluded, and any netting calculations, if applicable. (c) If the emissions unit is an existing electric utility steam generating unit, before beginning actual construction, the owner or operator shall provide a copy of the information set out in paragraph (L)(5)(b) to the reviewing authority. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require the owner or operator of such a unit to obtain any determination from the reviewing authority before beginning actual construction. (C)(d) The owner or operator shall monitor the emissions of any regulated NSR pollutant that could increase as a result of the proj ect and that is emitted by any emissions units identified in paragraph (d)(3)(B)(ii) (L)(5)(b)(ii) ; and calculate and maintain a record of the annual emissions, in tpy tons per year on a calendar year basis, for a period of five ( 5) years following resumpti on of regular operations after the change, or for a period of ten (10) years following resumption of regular operations after the change if the 155 project increases the design capacity or potential to emit of that regulated NSR pollutant at such emissions unit. (D)(e) If the unit is an existing electric utility steam generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Department within sixty ( 60) days after the end of each year during which records must be generated under paragraph (d)(3)(B) (L)(5)(b) setting out the unit's annual emissions during the year that preceded submission of the report. (E)(f) If the unit is an existing unit other than an electric utility steam generating unit, the owner or operator shall submit a report to the Dep artment if the annual emissions, in tpy tons per year , from the project identified in paragraph (d)(3)(B) (L)(5)(b) , exceed the baseline actual emissions (as documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(B)(iii) (L)(5)(b)(iii) , by a significant amou nt (as defined in paragraph (c)(14) (B)(37) ) for that regulated NSR pollutant, and if such emissions differ from the preconstruction projection as documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(B)(iii) (L)(5)(b)(iii) . Such report shall be submitted t o the Department within sixty ( 60) days after the end of such year. The report shall contain the following: (i) The name, address and telephone number of the major stationary source; (ii) The annual emissions as calculated pursuant to paragraph (d)(3)(C) (L)(5)(d) ; and (iii) Any other information needed for to make a compliance determination ( for example , an explanation as to why the emissions differ from the preconstruction projection). (6) A \"reasonable possibility\" under paragraph (L)(5) occurs when the owner or operator calculates the project to result in either: (a) A projected actual emissions increase of at least fifty (50) percent of the amount that is a \"significant emissions increase,\" as defined under paragraph (B)(38) (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant; or (b) A projected actual emissions increase that, added to the amount of emissions excluded under paragraph (B)(31)(b)(iii), sums to at least fifty (50) percent of the amount that is a \"significant emissions increase,\" as defined under paragraph (B)(38) (without reference to the amount that is a significant net emissions increase), for the regulated NSR pollutant. For a project for which a reasonable possibility occurs only within the meaning of this paragraph, and not also within the meaning of paragraph (L)(6)(a), then provisions (L)(5)(c) through (L)(5)(f) do not apply to the project. (4) If a project at a source with a PAL requires construction permitting under Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II, \" Permit Requirements, \" the owner or operator shall provide notification of source status as part of the permit application to the Department. (5)(7) The owner or operator of the source shall make the infor mation required to be documented and maintained pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) (L)(5) for review upon a request for inspection by the Department or the general public pursuant to the requirements contained in 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(viii).

(i)(a) The Department may approve the use of an actuals PAL for any existing major stationary source (except as provided in paragraph (i)(1)(ii) (N)(1)(b) ) if the PAL meets the requirements in paragraphs (i)(1) (N)(1) through (15)(N)(15) . The term PAL\" throughout paragraph Section (i)(N). (ii)(b) The Department shall not allow an actuals PAL for VOC or NO X for any major stationary source located in an extreme ozone nonattainment area. (iii)(c) Any physical change in or change in the m ethod of operation of a major stationary source that maintains its total source -wide emissions below the PAL level, meets the requirements in paragraphs (i)(1) (N)(1) through (15)(N)(15) , and complies with the PAL permit: (A)(i) Is not a major modificat ion for the PAL pollutant; (B)(ii) Does not have to be approved through Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard 7.1, \" Nonattainment New Source Review \"; however, will be reviewed through Regulation 61 -62.1, Section II , A. \"Permit Requirements, \" and (C)(iii) Is not subject to the provisions in paragraph (d)(2)(D) (L)(4) (restrictions on relaxing enforceable emission limitations that the major stationary source used to avoid applicability of the nonattainment major NSR program). 159 (iv)(d) Except as provided un der paragraph (i)(1)(iii)(C) (N)(1)(c)(iii) , a major stationary source shall continue to comply with all applicable federal or state requirements, emission limitations, and work practice requirements that were established prior to the effective date of the PAL. (2) Definitions. The definitions in paragraphs (i)(2)(i) (N)(2)(a) through (xi)(N)(2)(k) shall apply to actuals PALs consistent with paragraphs (i)(1) (N)(1) through (15)(N)(15) . When a term is not defined in these paragraphs, it shall have the meanin g given in paragraph Section (c)(B) of this regulation; paragraph (b) of Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard 7, \" Prevention of Significant Deterioration\"(\"Standard 7\"); or in the Clean Air Act. (i)(a) Actuals PAL for a major stationary source means a PAL based on the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) (B)(3) ) of all emissions units (as defined in paragraph (b)(20) of Standard 7 (B)(16) of this regulation ) at the source, that emit or have the potential to emit the PAL pollutant.

(ix)(i) PAL permit means the major NSR permit, the minor NSR permit, or the State operating permit under Regulation 61 -62.1 Section II G(G), or the Title V permit issued by the Department that establishes a PAL for a major stationary source. (x)(j) PAL pollutant means the pollutant for which a PAL is established at a maj or stationary source. (xi)(k) Significant emissions unit means an emissions unit that emits or has the potential to emit a PAL pollutant in an amount that is equal to or greater than the significant level (as defined in paragraph (c)(13) (B)(37) or in th e Clean Air Act, whichever is lower) for that PAL pollutant, but less than the amount that would qualify the unit as a major emissions unit as defined in paragraph (i)(2)(iv) (N)(2)(d) . (3) Permit application requirements . As part of a permit application requesting a PAL, the owner or operator of a major stationary source shall submit the following information to the Department for approval: (i)(a) A list of all emissions units at the source designated as small, significant , or major based on their potential to emit. In addition, the owner or operator of the source shall indicate which, if any, Federal or State applicable requirements, emission limitations or work practices apply to each unit. (ii)(b) Calculations of the baseline actual emissions (with supporting documentation). Baseline actual emissions are to include emissions associated not only with operation of the unit, but also emissions associated with startup, shutdown , and malfunction. (iii)(c) The calculation procedures that the major stationary source owner or operator proposes to use to convert the monitoring system data to monthly emissions and annual emissions based on a twelve ( 12) month rolling total for each month as required by paragraph (i)(13)(i) (N)(13)(a) . (4) General requirements for establishing PALs . (i)(a) The Department is allowed to establish a PAL at a major stationary source, provided that at a minimum, the requirements in paragraphs (i)(4)(i)(A) (N)(4)(a)(i) throu gh (G)(N)(4)(a)(vii) are met. (A)(i) The PAL shall impose an annual emission limitation in tpy tons per year that is enforceable as a practical matter, for the entire major stationary source. For each month during the PAL effective period after the fir st twelve ( 12) months of establishing a PAL, the major stationary source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the monthly emissions from each emissions unit under the PAL for the previous twelve (12) consecutive months is less than the PAL (a twelv e (12) month average, rolled monthly). For each month during the first eleven ( 11) months from the PAL effective date, the major stationary source owner or operator shall show that the sum of the preceding monthly emissions from the PAL effective date for each emissions unit under the PAL is less than the PAL. (B)(ii) The PAL shall be established in a PAL permit that meets the public participation requirements in paragraph (i)(5) (N)(5) . 161 (C)(iii) The PAL permit shall contain the requirements of p aragraph (i)(7) (N)(7) .

(E)(v) Each PAL shall regulate emissions of only one pollutant. (F)(vi) Each PAL shall have a PAL effective period of ten (10) years. (G)(vii) The owner or operator of the major stationary source with a PAL shall comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping , and reporting requirements provided in paragraphs (i)(12) (N)(12) through (14)(N)(14) for each emissions unit under the PAL through the PAL effective period. (ii)(b) At no time (during or after the PAL effective period) are emissions reductions of a PA L pollutant, which occur during the PAL effective period, creditable as decreases for purposes of offsets under paragraph (d)(1)(c) Section (D) Offset standards unless the level of the PAL is reduced by the amount of such emissions reductions and such redu ctions would be creditable in the absence of the PAL. (5) Public participation requirement for PALs . PALs for existing major stationary sources shall be established, renewed, or increased through a procedure that is consistent with paragraph (d)(6) and (d)(7). Section M. This includes the requirement that the Department provide the public with notice of the proposed approval of a PAL permit and at least a thirty (30) -day period for submittal of public comment. The Department must address all material comme nts before taking final action on the permit. (6) Setting the 10 -year actuals PAL level . (i)(a) Except as provided in paragraph (i)(6)(ii) (N)(6)(b) , the actuals PAL level for a major stationary source shall be established as the sum of the baseline actual emissions (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) (B)(3) ) of the PAL pollutant for each emissions unit at the source; plus an amount equal to the applicable significant level for the PAL pollutant under paragraph (c)(14) (B)(37) or under the Clean Air Act, whichever is lower. When establishing the actuals PAL level, for a PAL pollutant, only one consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period must be used to determi ne the baseline actual emissions for all existing emissions units. However, a different consecutive twenty -four ( 24)-month period may be used for each different PAL pollutant. Emissions associated with units that were permanently shut down after this twent y-four ( 24)-month period must be subtracted from the PAL level. The Department shall specify a reduced PAL level(s) (in tons/yr) in tons per year in the PAL permit to become effective on the future compliance date(s) of any applicable federal or state regulatory requirement(s) that the Department is aware of prior to issuance of the PAL permit. For instance, if the source owner or operator will be r equired to reduce emissions from industrial boilers in half from baseline emissions of sixty ( 60) ppm NO X to a new rule limit of thirty ( 30) ppm, then the permit shall contain a future effective PAL level that is equal to the current PAL level reduced by h alf of the original baseline emissions of such unit(s). (ii)(b) For newly constructed units (which do not include modifications to existing units) on which actual construction began after the twenty -four ( 24)-month period the emissions must be added to the PAL level in an amount equal to the potential to emit of the units.

(ii)(b) Reopening of the PAL permit . (A)(i) During the PAL effective period, the Department must reopen the PAL permit to: (1) Correct typographical/calculation errors made in setting the PAL or reflect a more accurate determination of emissions used to establish the PAL. (2) Reduce the PAL if the owner or operator of the major stationary source creates creditable emissions reductions for use as offsets under paragraph (d)(2) Section (D) . (3) Revise the PAL to reflect an increase in the PAL as provided under paragraph (i)(11) (N)(11) . (B)(ii) The Department shall have discretion to reopen the PAL permit for the following: (1) Reduce the PAL to reflect newly applicable federal requirements (for example, NSPS) with compliance dates after the PAL effective date. 163 (2) Reduce the PAL consistent with any other requirement, that is enforceable as a practical matter, and that the Department may impose on the major stationary source under the State Implementation Plan. (3) Reduce the PAL if the Department determin es that a reduction is necessary to avoid causing or contributing to a NAAQS or PSD increment violation, or to an adverse impact on an air quality related value that has been identified for a Federal Class I area by a Federal Land Manager and for which information is available to the general public. (C)(iii) Except for the permit reopening in paragraph (i)(8)(ii)(A)(1) (N)(8)(b)(i)(1) for the correction of typographical/calculation errors that do not increase the PAL level, all other reopenings shall be carried out in accordance with the public participation requirements of paragraph (i)(5) (N)(5) . (9) Expiration of a PAL . Any PAL which is not renewed in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (i)(10) (N)(10) shall expire at the end of the PAL effective period, and the requirements in paragraphs (i)(9)(i) (N)(9)(a) through (v)(N)(9)(e) shall apply. (i)(a) Each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units) that existed under the PAL shall comply with an a llowable emission limitation under a revised permit established according to the procedures in paragraphs (i)(9)(i)(A) (N)(9)(a)(i) through (B)(N)(9)(a)(ii) . (A)(i) Within the time frame specified for PAL renewals in paragraph (i)(10)(ii) (N)(10)(b) , the major stationary source shall submit a proposed allowable emission limitation for each emissions unit (or each group of emissions units, if such a distribution is more appropriate as decided by the Department) by distributing the PAL allowable emissions f or the major stationary source among each of the emissions units that existed under the PAL. If the PAL had not yet been adjusted for an applicable requirement that became effective during the PAL effective period, as required under paragraph (i)(10)(v) (N)(10)(e) , such distribution shall be made as if the PAL had been adjusted. (B)(ii) The Department shall decide whether and how the PAL allowable emissions will be distributed and issue a revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emissions u nit, or each group of emissions units, as the Department determines is appropriate. (ii)(b) Each emissions unit(s) shall comply with the allowable emission limitation on a twelve ( 12) month rolling basis. The Department may approve the use of monitoring systems (source testing, emission factors, etc.) other than Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS), Continuous Emissions Rate Monitoring System (CERMS), Predictive Emissions Moni toring System (PEMS), or Continuous Parameter Monitoring System (CPMS) to demonstrate compliance with the allowable emission limitation. (iii)(c) Until the Department issues the revised permit incorporating allowable limits for each emissions unit, or e ach group of emissions units, as required under paragraph (i)(9)(i)(A) (N)(9)(a)(i) , the source shall continue to comply with a source -wide, multi -unit emissions cap equivalent to the level of the PAL emission limitation. (iv)(d) Any physical change or c hange in the method of operation at the major stationary source will be subject to the nonattainment major NSR requirements if such change meets the definition of major modification in paragraph (c)(6) (B)(21) . (v)(e) The major stationary source owner or operator shall continue to comply with any State or Federal applicable requirements (BACT, RACT, NSPS, etc.) that may have applied either during the PAL effective period or prior to the PAL effective period except for those emission limitations that had b een established 164 pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(D) (L)(4) , but were eliminated by the PAL in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (i)(1)(iii)(C) (N)(1)(c)(iii) . (10) Renewal of a PAL . (i)(a) The Department shall follow the procedures specified in pa ragraph (i)(5) (N)(5) in approving any request to renew a PAL for a major stationary source, and shall provide both the proposed PAL level and a written rationale for the proposed PAL level to the public for review and comment. During such public review, an y person may propose a PAL level for the source for consideration by the Department. (ii)(b) Application deadline . A major stationary source owner or operator shall submit a timely application to the Department to request renewal of a PAL. A timely appl ication is one that is submitted at least six (6) months prior to, but not earlier than eighteen ( 18) months from, the date of permit expiration. This deadline for application submittal is to ensure that the permit will not expire before the permit is renewed. If the owner or operator of a major stationary source submits a complete application to renew the PAL within this time period, then the PAL shall continue to be effective until the revised permit with the renewed PAL is issued. (iii)(c) Application requirements . The application to renew a PAL permit shall contain the information required in paragraphs (i)(10)(iii)(A) (N)(10)(c)(i) through (D)(N)(10)(c)(iv) . (A)(i) (iii)(N)(3)(c) . (B)(ii) A proposed PAL level. (C)(iii) The sum of the potential to emit of all emissions units under the PAL (with supporting documentation). (D)(iv) Any other information the owner or operator wishes the Department to consider in determining th e appropriate level for renewing the PAL. (iv)(d) PAL adjustment . In determining whether and how to adjust the PAL, the Department shall consider the options outlined in paragraphs (i)(10)(iv)(A) (N)(10)(d)(i) and (B)(N)(10)(d)(ii) . However, in no case m ay any such adjustment fail to comply with paragraph (i)(10)(iv)(C) (N)(10)(d)(iii) . (A)(i) If the emissions level calculated in accordance with paragraph (i)(6) (N)(6) is equal to or greater than eighty ( 80) percent of the PAL level, the Department may renew the PAL at the same level without considering the factors set forth in paragraph (i)(10)(iv)(B) (N)(10)(d)(ii) ; or (B)(ii) The Department may set the PAL at a level that it determines to be more representative of the source's baseline actual emiss ions, or that it determines to be appropriate considering air quality needs, advances in control technology, anticipated economic growth in the area, desire to reward or encourage the source's voluntary emissions reductions, or other factors as specificall y identified by the Department in its written rationale. (C)(iii) Notwithstanding paragraphs (i)(10)(iv)(A) (N)(10)(d)(i) and (B)(N)(10)(d)(ii) , (1) If the potential to emit of the major stationary source is less than the PAL, the Department shall adjust the PAL to a level no greater than the potential to emit of the source; and 165 (2) The Department shall not approve a renewed PAL level higher than the current PAL, unless the major stationary source has complied with the provisions of paragraph (i)(11) (N)(11) (increasing a PAL). (v)(e) If the compliance date for a state or federal requirement that applies to the PAL source occurs during the PAL effective period, and if the Department has not already adjusted for such requirement, the PAL shall be adjusted at the time of PAL permit renewal or Title V permit renewal, whichever occurs first. (11) Increasing a PAL during the PAL effective period. (i)(a) The Department may increase a PAL emission limitation only if the major stationary source complies with the provisions in paragraphs (i)(11)(i)(A) (N)(11)(a)(i) through (D)(N)(11)(a)(iv) . (A)(i) The owner or operator of the major stationary source shal l submit a complete application to request an increase in the PAL limit for a PAL major modification. Such application shall identify the emissions unit(s) contributing to the increase in emissions so as to cause the major stationary source's emissions to equal or exceed its PAL. (B)(ii) As part of this application, the major stationary source owner or operator shall demonstrate that the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the small emissions units, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions u nits assuming application of BACT equivalent controls, plus the sum of the allowable emissions of the new or modified emissions unit(s) exceeds the PAL. The level of control that would result from BACT equivalent controls on each significant or major emiss ions unit shall be determined by conducting a new BACT analysis at the time the application is submitted, unless the emissions unit is currently required to comply with a BACT or LAER requirement that was established within the preceding ten (10) years. In such a case, the assumed control level for that emissions unit shall be equal to the level of BACT or LAER with which that emissions unit must currently comply. (C)(iii) The owner or operator obtains a major NSR permit for all emissions unit(s) identi fied in paragraph (i)(11)(i)(A) (N)(11)(a)(i) , regardless of the magnitude of the emissions increase resulting from them (that is, no significant levels apply). These emissions unit(s) shall comply with any emissions requirements resulting from the nonattai nment major NSR program process (for example, LAER), even though they have also become subject to the PAL or continue to be subject to the PAL. (D)(iv) The PAL permit shall require that the increased PAL level shall be effective on the day any emission s unit that is part of the PAL major modification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL pollutant. (ii)(b) The Department shall calculate the new PAL as the sum of the allowable emissions for each modified or new emissions unit, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the significant and major emissions units (assuming application of BACT equivalent controls as determined in accordance with paragraph (i)(11)(i)(B) (N)(11)(a)(ii) ), plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of the smal l emissions units. (iii)(c) The PAL permit shall be revised to reflect the increased PAL level pursuant to the public notice requirements of paragraph (i)(5) (N)(5) . (12) Monitoring requirements for PALs . (i)(a) General Requirements. 166 (A)(i) Each PAL permit must contain enforceable requirements for the monitoring system that accurately determines plantwide emissions of the PAL pollutant in terms of mass per unit of time. Any monitoring system authorized for use in the PAL permit must be based on s ound science and meet generally acceptable scientific procedures for data quality and manipulation. Additionally, the information generated by such system must meet minimum legal requirements for admissibility in a judicial proceeding to enforce the PAL pe rmit. (B)(ii) The PAL monitoring system must employ one or more of the four general monitoring approaches meeting the minimum requirements set forth in paragraphs (i)(12)(ii)(A) (N)(12)(b)(i) through (D)(N)(12)(b)(iv) and must be approved by the Department. (C)(iii) Notwithstanding paragraph (i)(12)(i)(B) (N)(12)(a)(ii) , you may also employ an alternative monitoring approach that meets paragraph (i)(12)(i)(A) (N)(12)(a)(i) if approved by the Department. (D)(iv) Failure to use a monitoring system that meets the requirements of this regulation renders the PAL invalid. (ii)(b) Minimum Performance Requirements for Approved Monitoring Approaches. The following are acceptable general monitoring approaches when conduc ted in accordance with the minimum requirements in paragraphs (i)(12)(iii) (N)(12)(c) through (ix)(N)(12)(i) : (A)(i) Mass balance calculations for activities using coatings or solvents; (B)(ii) Continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS); (C)(iii) Continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) or Predictive emissions monitoring system (PEMS); and (D)(iv) Emission Factors.

An owner or operator using CPMS or PEMS to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: (A)(i) The CPMS or the PEMS must be based on current site -specific data demonstrating a correlation between the monitored parameter( s) and the PAL pollutant emissions across the range of operation of the emissions unit; and (B)(ii) Each CPMS or PEMS must sample, analyze, and record data at least every fifteen ( 15) minutes, or at another less frequent interval approved by the Department, while the emissions unit is operating. (vi)(f) Emission factors. An owner or operator using emission factors to monitor PAL pollutant emissions shall meet the following requirements: (A)(i) All emission factors shall be adjusted, if appropriate, to account for the degree of uncertainty or limitati ons in the factors' development; (B)(ii) The emissions unit shall operate within the designated range of use for the emission factor, if applicable; and (C)(iii) If technically practicable, the owner or operator of a significant emissions unit that relies on an emission factor to calculate PAL pollutant emissions shall conduct validation testing to determine a site-specific emission factor within six ( 6) months of PAL permit issuance, unless the Department determines that testing is not required. (vii)(g) A source owner or operator must record and report maximum potential emissions without considering enforceable emission limitations or operational restrictions for an emissions unit during any period of time that there is no monitoring data, unles s another method for determining emissions during such periods is specified in the PAL permit. (viii) (h) Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs (i)(12)(iii) (N)(12)(c) through (vii)(N)(12)(g) , where an owner or operator of an emissions unit canno t demonstrate a correlation between the monitored parameter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions rate at all operating points of the emissions unit, the Department shall, at the time of permit issuance: (A)(i) Establish default value(s) for determining c ompliance with the PAL based on the highest potential emissions reasonably estimated at such operating point(s); or (B)(ii) Determine that operation of the emissions unit during operating conditions when there is no correlation between monitored parame ter(s) and the PAL pollutant emissions is a violation of the PAL. (ix)(i) Re-validation. All data used to establish the PAL pollutant must be re -validated through performance testing or other scientifically valid means approved by the Department. Such t esting must occur at least once every five ( 5) years after issuance of the PAL. (13) Recordkeeping requirements . 168 (i)(a) The PAL permit shall require an owner or operator to retain a copy of all records necessary to determine compliance with any requir ement of paragraph Section (i)(N) and of the PAL, including a determination of each emissions unit's twelve ( 12) month rolling total emissions, for five ( 5) years from the date of such record.

The Department may use other additional means to provide adequate notice to th e affected public , including by publishing the notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the source is located (or in a State publication designed to give general public notice) ; Fiscal Impact Statement: 170 There is no anticipated incre ased cost to the state or its political subdivisions resulting from this revision. Amendments to Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, and the SIP include revisions that will help streamline state requirements and therefore red uce economic burden. Statement of Need and Reasonableness: This Statement of Need and Reasonableness was determined by staff analysis pursuant to 1976 Code Sections 1 -23-115(C)(1) -(3) and (9) -(11). DESCRIPTION OF REGULATION: Amendment of Regulation 61-62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, and the South Carolina State Implementation Plan (\"SIP\"). Purpose: The amendments to Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, support the Department's goal of promoting and protecting the health of the public and the environment in a more efficient and effective manner. These amendments expand and clarify definitions applicable to air pollution control regulations and standards; streamline permitting options; clarify reportin g requirements; identify the Department's consistent noticing method; improve the regulations' organizational structure; and provide corrections for consistency, clarification, reference, punctuation, codification, formatting, and spelling to improve the o verall text of Regulation 61 -62. Legal Authority: 1976 Code Sections 48 -1-10 et seq. Plan for Implementation: The DHEC Regulation Development Update (accessible at http://www.scdhec.gov/Agency/RegulationsAndUpdates/RegulationDevelopmentUpdate/) provides a summary of and link to this amendment. Additionally, printed copies are available for a fee from the Department's Freedom of Information Office. Upon taking legal effect, Department personnel will take appropriate steps to inform the regulated community of the amendment and any associated information. DETERMINATION OF NEED AND REASONABLENESS OF THE REGULATION BASED ON ALL FACTORS HEREIN AND EXPECTED BENEFITS: Pursuant to the federal CAA and the South Carolina Pollution Control Act the Department is amending South Carolina Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, and SIP as follows: 1. R.61 -62.1, Definitions and General Requirements, Section II, Permit Requirements, to expand and improve consistency in language regarding gen eral and registration permits, 2. The introductory paragraph to R.61 -62.5, Standard No. 2, Ambient Air Quality Standards, to remove the sentence describing the test method for Gaseous Fluorides to improve the accuracy and clarity of the regulation's text, 3. R.61 -62.5, Standard No. 5.2, Control of Oxides of Nitrogen (NO X), to update applicability and exemptions, as well as make corrections for internal consistency, punctuation, codification, and spelling, 4. R.61 -62.5, Standard No. 7, Prevention of Signi ficant Deterioration, to update applicability and exemptions, as well as make corrections for consistency with federal regulations, internal consistency, punctuation, codification, and spelling, 5. R.61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1, Nonattainment New Source Rev iew (NSR), to improve the overall clarity and structure of the regulation, as well as to make corrections for consistency with federal regulations, internal consistency, punctuation, codification, and spelling, 171 6. R.61 -62.1, Definitions and General Requir ements; R.61 7, Prevention of Significant Deterioration; R.61 -62.5, Standard No. 7.1, Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR); and R.61 -62.70, Title V Operating Permit Program, to update public participation procedures, and 7. Definitional updates, clarification of certain permitting provisions, and other changes and additions deemed necessary, as well as corrections for internal consistency, clarification, reference, punctuation, codification, formatting, and spelling to improv e the overall text of R.61 -62 as necessary. These amendments are needed, reasonable, and beneficial in that they simplify, clarify, and correct elements of the Department 's air quality regulations to support the Department 's goal of promoting and protect ing the health of the public and the environment in a more efficient and effective manner. DETERMINATION OF COSTS AND BENEFITS: The Department does not anticipate an increase in costs to the state, its political subdivisions, or the regulated community resulting from these revisions. The amendments ensure consistency with Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") regulations, which the Department implements pursuant to the authority granted by Section 48 -1-50 of the Pollution Control Act. The amendments wi ll benefit the regulated community by maintaining state implementation of the federal requirements, as opposed to federal implementation. Amendments to Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, and the SIP, will help streamline st ate requirements related to permitting and other matters to conform to current Prevention of Significant Deterioration, New Source Review, and the Title V Permit Program standards. These revisions may potentially save money for the regulated community by p roviding clarification on exemptions, permitting, and other requirements, while continuing to ensure environmental protection. UNCERTAINTIES OF ESTIMATES: There are no uncertainties of estimates relative to the costs to the state or its political subdivi sions. These revisions seek to provide clarity to the regulated community. EFFECT ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH: The amendments to Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, seek to provide continued state -focused protection of the environment and public health. DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH IF THE REGULATION IS NOT IMPLEMENTED: The Department does not anticipate detrimental effect on the environment and/or public health associated with these revision s. To the contrary, the state's delegated authority to implement programs beneficial to public health and the environment may be compromised if these amendments are not adopted. Permit streamlining and regulatory text clarification seek to have a positive effect on both the environment and public health. Statement of Rationale: The Department is amending Regulation 61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards, to support the goal of promoting and protecting the health of the public and the environment in a more efficient and 172 effective manner. These amendments expand and clarify definitio ns applicable to air pollution control regulations and standards; streamline permitting options; clarify reporting requirements; identify the Department's consistent noticing method; improve the regulations' organizational structure; and provide correction s for consistency, clarification, reference, punctuation, codification, formatting, and spelling to improve the overall text of Regulation 61 -62. ATTACHMENT B SUMMARY OF PUBLIC COMMENTS AND DEPARTMENT RESPONSES Document No. 4873 R.61 -62, Air Pollution Control Regulations and Standards As of t he February 25, 2019 , close of the Notice of Proposed Regulation comment period: NAME SECTION CITATION PUBLIC COMMENT DEPARTMENT RESPONSE EPA Region 4 R. 61 -62.5 Standard No. 5.2 In Regulation 61 -62.5, Standard No. 5.2, \"Control of Oxides of Nitrogen (NO X),\" South Carolina is eliminating an exemption from rule applicability for sources required to comply with NO X limitations pursuant to Regulation 61 -62.96, \"Nitrogen Oxides (NO X) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO 2) Budget Trading regulation, but more recently has revised the regulation, now titled \"Nitrogen Oxides (NO X) Budget Program,\" in a separate rulemaking package. Does the State still wish to eliminate the exemption from Standard No. 5.2 for sources subject to NO X limitations pursuant to Regulation 61 -62.96? The Department has removed the proposed strike -out of Reg ulation 61-62.96 from the list of exemptions , and moved the proposed addition of Regulation 61-62.97 to a separate paragraph for consistency and clarity. 2 HEALTH REGULATION ENFORCEMENT REPORT SOUTH CAROLINA BOARD OF HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL March 7 , 201 9 Bureau of Health Facilities Licensing Facility Type Total # of Licensed Providers In-Home Care Providers 610 1.
