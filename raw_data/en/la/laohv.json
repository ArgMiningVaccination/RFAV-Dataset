Cinnamon has a delicious, naturally sweet flavor and is one of the oldest known spices. It's also one of the key ingredients in chai and spice tea. Widely used in cooking and traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, cinnamon is touted as a natural remedy with many health benefits. Despite its long history of use, very few studies have tested cinnamon's effects. Nevertheless, a 2018 study published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition found that consuming a cinnamon extract significantly reduced inflammation and clinical symptoms in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Cinnamon may also have benefits related to blood sugar control and lipid levels. A 2018 review found that cinnamon consumption was associated with decreased fasting glucose, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. However, there was no significant effect on hemoglobin A1c levels. Although some people like to sprinkle cinnamon on oatmeal or apple slices, cinnamon tea is another option for getting a little daily dose. This simple recipe requires only a few ingredients and a few minutes for the cinnamon and tea to steep. Ingredients 1 Ceylon cinnamon stick 8 ounces water 1 tea bag (regular or decaffeinated black tea or herbal tea) Preparation Place the cinnamon stick in a mug. Boil the water and add it to the mug. Steep the cinnamon stick in boiling water, covered, for 10 minutes. Add the tea bag. Steep for 1 to 2 additional minutes. Remove the tea bag and cinnamon stick. Serve warm or hot. Variations and Substitutions Many products labeled as cinnamon are sourced from species of cinnamon (such as the Cinnamomum cassia plant) that contain coumarin, a natural substance known to be hepatotoxic and carcinogenic in large doses. To avoid coumarin, opt for Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum). You can substitute a rooibos or honeybush tea instead of black tea if you're in the mood for herbal tea. If you prefer to skip the tea, you can simply enjoy warm, cinnamon-infused water instead. You can also try adding one to two thin slices of fresh ginger to the cup before steeping for a spicy kick. Add a dash of turmeric and black pepper with the ginger before steeping for an additional flavor boost. Cooking and Serving Tips Try adding warm milk (or a dairy-free alternative) for a creamier drink and sweeten it to taste with honey or maple syrup before serving.You can also skip the milk and squeeze a lemon or lime wedge into the tea for an added citrus flavor.If you take diabetes medication or any medication that affects blood glucose or insulin levels, consult with your healthcare provider before taking therapeutic doses of cinnamon. Taking cinnamon together with medication may have an additive effect and cause blood glucose levels to dip too low.Some people may experience allergic reactions to herbal tea containing cinnamon, such as dermatitis. Beyond potential health benefits, a cup of cinnamon tea can be a delicious addition to your regular tea rotation. Still, overdoing it can lead to excessive intake of coumarins if you use a cinnamon species such as Cinnamomum cassia. If you're unsure how much you should be drinking, consult your healthcare provider before adding it to your diet. Rate this Recipe You've already rated this recipe.
