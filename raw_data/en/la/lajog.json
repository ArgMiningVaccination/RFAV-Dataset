I am very pleased to be able to report once again a year in which our staff have achieved our main performance and financial targets, as well as high levels of patient satisfaction. To reach those targets is both a tough challenge and huge achievement for any NHS organisation in the current climate. I am grateful to all our staff for their contribution through the year. The dedication displayed by our staff to meeting the needs of patients and service users, through more than 2.1 million interactions in the year, is of the highest order. It is their commitment to consistently delivering high quality care which ensures we achieve such positive levels of patient satisfaction. This year we are celebrating the 70th anniversary of the NHS, and marking the huge impact it has made for the people of our country. The longevity of the NHS is a tribute to the vision of those who created it back in the 1940s, and all who have worked since to deliver NHS services. Its founders had high aspiration and we still hold dear to their values today; perhaps one of the best tributes we can make to them is to continue striving to improve and make our services better and more effective. BCHC, now well established as a Foundation Trust, is focusing on delivering community and specialist healthcare for the communities we serve. As part of this commitment we are pleased to be playing a full part in helping forge the future shape of the NHS locally, ensuring active representation for community services within the two Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP) footprints within which our core services fit, namely those for Birmingham and Solihull and the Black Country.Effective partnerships are vitally important within the modern health and social care environment, bringing together the various elements of the NHS (providers and commissioners), GPs, Local Authorities, voluntary and charity organisations. As part of this drive we worked closely through the year with two other trusts, Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust, as part of the 'Transforming Care Together' programme. Whilst ultimately the three trusts decided not to formalise that partnership, we each gained considerable learning, particularly around the synergies of physical and mental health. I would like to thank all who devoted time and effort to the programme and wish our partner trusts well for the future. As Chair of both the Council of Governors and Board of Directors, I thank all who have given their commitment to these bodies through the past year. Both groups maintain a determined focus upon the interests of our patients and service users, and I am particularly pleased that Governors and Directors are all regularly involved in activities such as frontline patient safety visits and staff engagement events. During the year in review we said farewell to Tracy Taylor after many successful years as our Chief Executive. I would like to reiterate the Board's thanks to Tracy for the hugely significant contribution she made over several years to leading and building this organisation. The Board's sincere thanks are also for Peter Axon who stepped into the role of Interim Chief Executive so effectively for us, maintaining trust performance through several months. I also wish to thank two other colleagues who left the Board during the year: Celia Furnival, who retired after many years of dedicated service as a Non-Executive Director, and Andy Message from Chairman Tom Storrow AR 6Wakeman who served us so professionally as Medical Director. Tracy's departure provided us with the opportunity to appoint Richard Kirby as our Chief Executive, a role he took up on March 1st, 2018. I am delighted that we have been able to appoint Richard, who is already making a positive impact across the organisation and health economy, beginning to implement exciting and ambitious plans for our future. I hope you will fi nd our Annual Report interesting and, once again, thank all who played a part in creating another successful year for the Trust, to the benefi t of the individuals and communities we serve. Tom Storrow Chairman Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust AR 7Message from Chief Executive Officer Richard Kirby It is my real privilege to have the opportunity to become Chief Executive of Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (BCHC). I was delighted to take up the role from March 1st, 2018; the final month of the year under review in this report. My thanks go to all those who played a part in delivering another successful year for the Trust and creating such a strong platform from which we can build into the future, towards an ambition of providing outstanding, integrated care. Leading my local Trust is a very special opportunity for me. I started my NHS career 20 years ago, working with a group of GPs in south-west Birmingham and have worked in Birmingham and the Black Country ever since. I believe that, as an organisation, we are uniquely placed to be able to make positive differences, deep within the communities we serve. In delivering a wide range of community services across Birmingham, together with highly regarded specialist services across the wider West Midlands, our staff are actively engaged within those communities day in, day out. BCHC has a well proven track record in delivering high quality care, whilst also achieving its performance and financial targets. That proven record is a tribute to the commitment and dedication of our staff. I have spent much of my first few weeks within the Trust getting out-and-about, spending time with teams; listening and learning about what they do and how they view the organisation and their service. I must thank all I have met - staff, patients and others with an interest in the Trust - for such a warm welcome, and I look forward to working with you further. I have learned so much about many aspects of the life-changing and life-enhancing work our staff carry out, across all our varied services. I have seen clearly how staff are focused around the patient's needs. I have also noted a general understanding of the importance of multi-disciplinary working and a commitment to rehabilitation and recovery, reinforced by a commitment to working in partnership. Working together in partnerships - with our colleagues in primary care, mental health, social care, education and the voluntary and community sector - will be key to how we manage increasing demand for our services and provide good care. Central to this is our determination to play a leading and effective role in our main local Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP) in Birmingham and Solihull, as well as continuing to play an important role in the neighbouring Black Country and West Birmingham STP. Collaboration between each of the organisations involved in these partnerships is absolutely vital to shaping an effective way forward for health and social care in times of increasing demand and pressured resources. Community services can provide the 'glue' that holds other parts of the system together - and we must ensure that we fulfil that role within these partnerships. A number of key themes will be crucial for us through the next year - solidifying our role within integrated care systems; exploring new ways of delivering community care, and engaging fully with our well-motivated staff, whilst still maintaining focus on quality and safety of care and managing amid constrained financial resources. Together these themes bring tough challenges - and also great opportunities for us. Through the coming months we will be keen to talk with our external stakeholders - anyone who has an interest in working with us, or receives our services. We want to hear your thoughts on these themes and how we can best meet the needs of those we serve in the future, as part of our ambition to provide outstanding, integrated care. I look forward to working with all our staff and our partners in the next exciting stage of development for Birmingham Community Healthcare and the communities we serve.

AR 16Table 1.5 Birmingham Dental Hospital Overview Birmingham Dental Hospital and School Oral Surgery Special Care Oral Medicine Paediatric Dentistry Orthodontics Restorative Dentistry 1.2.6 Corporate Functions The delivery of healthcare services by our Clinical Divisions is supported by a range of corporate functions. During 2016 we realigned our corporate services to revised executive portfolios, allowing us to position these services as clear operational, tactical and strategic support functions to our clinical divisions. Our Human Resources team and Organisational Development team provide support to our workforce both individually and as a whole staff team. During the last full financial year BCHC employed an average of over 4,190 whole time equivalents (WTE) staff. This breaks down into just over 3,900 WTE permanently employed staff with other categories making up a further 270. The majority of staff fall into the categories of: 7 6 per cent medical, nursing, healthcare assistant and scientific or support staff. 2 4 per cent administrative and estates staff (16 per cent providing support to individual business divisions and 8 per cent providing support to corporate services). Our Estates team are key to our role as a provider of community healthcare, where services are delivered from a large of network of sites. Along with our Information Technology team, they make right delivery of the right service at the right time a reality. We currently deliver services from over 300 sites across the region, many provided in GP surgeries or local community settings. In addition to this, we have circa 280 inpatient beds across the city in our two community hospitals, two intermediate care centres and our dedicated unit for Palliative Care. Within the corporate services there is a small Business Development team who provide support for developing tenders for both winning new, and retaining existing, business. This has been a success for the Trust with a strong record of winning tenders in the last three years. The team also support the division's business staff in developing business cases for newly commissioned services and advise on market opportunities. AR 172.1 Patient Activity The Trust continued to roll out our new clinical information system (RIO) during the year as part of a programme of work to improve our electronic patient record and collection of patient activity data. During 2017-18 we had around 2.2 million interactions with our patients and service users. These interactions are measured in terms of units called 'activity' and the table below sets out our activity for 2017-18. 2.2 Income and Expenditure 2.2.1 Where our money comes from The majority of our income comes from the provision of patient care, which totals \u00a3248.7m.

Charity Birmingham Community Healthcare Charity has been an active charity since April 2016 and has raised over \u00a3100k during its rst two years to help provide the 'extras' for patients, their families and staff who support them. BCHC charity continues to have an active external Internet page and internal Intranet page and has developed a strong online presence through Trust news stories and social media. The well-established 'Just Giving' page continues to provide staff and supporters with an easy and accessible method to fundraise. Engaging staff across the services remains a key focus for the charity and this is done through a range of activities including the Trust Induction Programme and working with and supporting teams on a one to one basis in order to access funds which make a difference for patients. Movement within the charitable funds has seen a 17 per cent increase; with 82 per cent of funds being engaged with income gain or an expenditure during the year. Through increased staff awareness and engagement, over \u00a344k has been spent on enhancing patient care since 2016. Gardens and clinical spaces have been transformed, extra in house activities have been provided to enhance patient enjoyment and experience and items that enhance clinical care across community services have been purchased. 2018 will see the charity launch its rst large appeal to support end of life care in the community. Over \u00a330k has been raised during 2017-18 through successful fundraising events such as; climbing Mount Snowdon, a 'Delicious day for Dementia' a delicious treats sale, skydives and the 100mile bicycle ride; Velo. The Charity has established strong partnerships with the Patient Safety and the Research and Innovation teams and continues to encourage active fundraising and supporting staff to access funds for development. The charity has received over \u00a320k from individuals taking on challenges 2.4. Summary of achievements Details of the Trust's quality performance are contained in Section 3 - Quality Report. This report provides details on the quality of the services we provide in the form of an Annual Quality Account each year. Copies of this section of the Annual Report are accessible on the Trust website or by contacting our Communications Team on tel: 0121 466 7281 or email: info@bhamcommunity.nhs.uk . 2.5 Going Concern Based on the performance detailed in these Financial Statements and the Financial Plan 2018-19, the Trust's forecast cash balances will continue to be sufcient for it to continue meeting its working capital requirements for the immediate future. Therefore, after making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the NHS foundation trust has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.

How we Measure Performance Performance in the Trust is managed via a series of monthly Balanced Scorecards which report Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) at Trust and Divisional levels supported by disaggregated performance and activity information at Team and Business Unit levels via the 1Vision platform. Each KPI has an executive lead with responsibility for performance in that area and the overall executive lead for Performance is the Chief Financial Ofcer. Scrutiny of the Balanced Scorecards is supported by a governance structure of meetings and escalation principals to ensure issues are identied and managed at the appropriate level and in a timely manner. Divisions which are performing well against targets receive less frequent scrutiny than those reporting a number of breaches. 3.1.1. Development of the Balanced Scorecards The Balanced Scorecard is subject to an annual review with Executive Leads to ensure that KPIs are relevant and that the setting of targets and tolerance points is informed by local performance, commissioners' requirements and national guidance. The Performance and Contracting Team lead this process and review relevant national guidance including the NHS Improvement Single Oversight Framework along with locally developed requirements and contractual obligations as agreed with commissioners. Benchmarking data is used to inform target setting enabling the Trust to compare its own performance with other Providers of care. 3.1.2. Structure of the Balanced Scorecard Scorecards are developed in ve key domains. These are Safety, Clinical Quality, Patient Experience, Workforce and Efciency and Financial Performance. This structure facilitates triangulation by highlighting overarching themes where pressure may be developing. In addition each KPI is aligned to one of the Trust's six Strategic Goals as shown in table 1.11 below: Table 1.11 Trust's Six Strategic Goals in 2018-19 PurposeTo transform and deliver high quality, efcient, integrated services that enable the best possible outcomes through our integrated delivery models.

Performance Analysis 2017-18 3.2. Key Performance Indicators and 'Cause and Effect' denitions Individual indicators are considered as either 'Cause' or 'Effect' KPIs, with cause KPIs being those seen as driving poor outcomes later on if not addressed and remedied. The 'key' indicators in each domain are dened as shown in the following table 1.12 Table 1.12 Key Performance Indicators (measures) Domain 'Cause' KPIs Safety Safe Stafng Rates Healthcare Acquired Infection Rates (C.

Performance Management in Divisions Divisional 'Confirm and Challenge' sessions take place each month where Senior Managers and Service leads meet with relevant support service colleagues and review the latest scorecards. Red flagged KPIs which have breached targets and 'Amber' KPIs which have been outside of tolerance for 3 or more months require Recovery Plans. Additional information on Cash Releasing Efficiency Schemes (CRES) is also viewed at Divisional sessions with schemes which are not delivering also requiring Recovery Plans. Corporate Areas are treated as a Division and produce recovery plans and attend PPMB on the same basis as Clinical Divisions. These plans are then submitted to the monthly Performance and Programme Management Board (PPMB) and presented by Divisional representatives for Executive level scrutiny and support with required actions. 3.4. Performance Management at Trust Level The Performance and Programmes Management Board (PPMB), which is comprised of senior members of staff and Executive Directors, meet monthly to review scorecards and seek assurance from Divisional representatives regarding their recovery plans. This group also seeks to identify interdependencies between indicators as a test to recovery plans supported by the range of senior managers and Executive leads in attendance. PPMB have an escalation route for persistent breaches and can require a service to attend Executive Managers Forum (EMF) or Finance and Performance Assurance Committee to seek further assurance and input to Divisional plans. PPMB can also establish short life working groups to address performance issues, particularly where these are affecting more than one area of the Trust. AR 243.5. Quality and Performance Report A monthly Quality and Performance Report is presented to the Board. This includes Executive Summaries of Performance in the key domains, narrative for each breach identifi ed on the Trust Balanced Scorecard and a range of supporting information providing assurance to the Board. The Quality and Performance Report is published on the Trust's public internet site. 3.5.1. Patient Safety Domain The Patient Safety Domain has maintained strong performance throughout 2017-18. In particular we are proud to report: no cases of MRSA no avoidable cases of hospital acquired Clostridium Diffi cile no patients developing avoidable grade 3 or 4 pressure ulcers whilst admitted to Trust care no avoidable in-patient deaths identifi ed, following the establishment of new reporting requirements relating to mortality reviews A key focus for the Trust in this domain has been the rate of falls with harm, which are measured per 1000 Occupied Bed Days, and the number of falls with severe harm sustained under our care. The falls rate target was set as a comparison to last year's outturn performance and as shown in the Figure 1.1 below has remained within target for 11 of the 12 months of the year due to a variety of actions including a focus on falls by the patient safety team and assessment and completion of root cause analyses reports whenever a fall does occur.

For January 2018 NHS Benchmarking report a 6 month average Falls with harm rate for Community Trusts of 2.23 per 1000 Occupied Bed days, against the BCHC average of 1.97. When all falls are considered (regardless of whether a harm was sustained) the six month average for Community Trusts shows 8.48 per 1000 Occupied Bed days, against a BCHC average of 6.87. The Trust also counts the absolute number of falls where a severe harm such as a fracture is sustained by the patient. In 17-18 we end the year reporting a total of 22 such falls. Unfortunately this represents an increase on the previous year where we reported a total of 13 falls with severe harm, although it is a slight improvement on the previous year when we reported 22. Whilst the overall rate of falls shows improvement the Trust seeks to identify learning from all falls resulting in a severe harm and conducts detailed root cause analyses into every event. The Patient Safety domain monitors other areas of patient harm including the four harms monitored by the National Safety Thermometer tool managed by the NHS Quality Observatory. Figure 1.2 demonstrates Trust Performance in this area (shown in blue) against the national average for Community Trusts (shown in pink).

As already highlighted the inpatient teams were able to avoid the development of any avoidable grade 3 or 4 pressure ulcers in 2017-18 improving on the one such pressure ulcer reported in 16-17. In community nursing the teams report 9 avoidable grade 3 or 4 pressure ulcers for the year compared to 11 the previous year. This data is also monitored by the Quality Observatory and the strong performance reported throughout the year is supported by a benchmarked prevalence funnel graph Figure 1.3. This shows the Trust (shown as a red dot) having signi cantly lower pressure ulcers than the Community average and also carrying out a larger sample size than any other Community Trust. Figure 1.3: The Quality Observatory prevalence funnel graph for Pressure Ulcer Incidence Pressure Ulcers - Prevalence For a second year the Trust continues to monitor a 'Safe Staf ng' measure, which con rms an appropriate level of staf ng was provided on wards, based on the case mix acuity of admitted patients. The overall picture shown in the graph below (Figure 1.4) gives assurance that the Trust is managing to staff wards safely despite the signi cant reduction in Agency spend reported elsewhere. Individual shortfalls in staf ng are identi ed as a result of this process and are managed between Matrons and General Managers with support from the Trust Bank of ce.350 300 250 200 100 50 0 10k 20k30k 40k 50k 60k 70k 80k0 Harm patients AR 27Figure 1.4 Safe Staf ng Rate Figure 1.5 Inpatient Deaths (bedded areas)In line with updated national guidance the Trust began reporting against the 'Learning from Deaths' framework for 2017-18. As shown in Figure 1.5 below the Trust has reported every inpatient death for the year, highlighting which patients were receiving palliative (end of life) care. All non-palliative deaths as well as palliative patients on main stream wards are subject to a full case note review to assess whether de ciencies in care could have contributed to the death. To provide additional assurance ve randomly selected palliative deaths are also reviewed each month. It is therefore pleasing to note that no case note reviews for the year revealed any examples of poor care contributing to an inpatient death. In addition (and as shown in green in the chart above) the Trust continues to monitor the overall rate of non-palliative deaths to discharges to identify any areas of concern. As of January 2018 the Trust reports a 6 month average of 2 per cent comparing favourably to an NHS Community Trust benchmark of 2.3 per cent. 120 100 80 60 40 0 95.72 100.73 99.23 103.58104.27 107.85102.60102.10105.60 98.78101.91 102.75 Mar 18Apr 17 May 17 Jun 17 Sep 17Aug 17 Oct 17 Nov 17 Dec 17 Jan 18 Feb 18Jul 17 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0571215Apr 17 May 17 Jun 17 Sep 17Aug 17 Oct 17 Nov 17 Dec 17 Jan 18 Feb 18Jul 173.50 3.002.502.001.501.000.500.00 47 5562211151211 7 855 71518111.982.55 1.531.972.072.73 0.77 0.782.98 2.793.06 Deaths Palliative - SheldonDeaths Non Palliative % of Deaths/Discharges (excluding palliative deaths) AR 28Figure 1.6 Percentage of Rapid Response Patients requiring onwards admission to Acute Hospital3.5.2. Clinical Quality Domain The Trust continues to monitor the effectiveness of our community Rapid Response service by reporting the percentage of crisis interventions following which the patient still required an admission to acute care. As shown in Figure 1.6 the service has managed to stay well within its target that no more than 15 per cent of patients should require further acute admission and has coped particularly well with winter pressures this year. The Trust monitors a set of 'Essential Care Indicators' monthly. This reports an aggregated position for Ward, Community and Learning Disability Teams and is based on a monthly audit of documentation to provide assurance that key clinical risk assessments and action plans are being completed to the required quality and within appropriate timescales. Performance in this KPI is used as a key tool to triangulate clinical performance with other KPIs. For example concerns raised by breaches of targets on Bank and Agency staff in community nursing teams are mitigated by assessment of Community ECIs which suggest that teams are managing to maintain compliance with basic care standards during periods of sickness or staff vacancies. Performance for the reports is shown in the Figures 1.7 to 1.10. Performance is rated against a 95 per cent completion target. 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6420 11.10 10.60 11.40 9.7012.80 9.707.109.0010.50 6.708.40 8.00 Mar 18Apr 17 May 17 Jun 17 Sep 17Aug 17 Oct 17 Nov 17 Dec 17 Jan 18 Feb 18Jul 17 AR 29Figure 1.7: Essential Care Indicators - Community Nursing Teams Figure 1.8: Essential Care Indicators - In-patient WardsThe Community based indicators show strong performance throughout the year and give assurance that teams have the necessary capacity to ensure that the fundamental care assessments are taking place.

As the graph above shows performance has generally been satisfactory in this area although has dipped into the amber range on two separate occasions. A new Essential Care Indicator was introduced for 2017-18 to report against Community LD team assessments. As shown in the table above this has been a challenging area and has been particularly affected by data quality issues as the teams move from paper records to a full Electronic Patient Record. However it is positive to report an improving trend in this area and the KPI will continue to be monitored closely.120 100 80 60 20 97.2092.5098.0097.40 96.4096.70 17 Jun 17 Sep 17Aug 17 Oct 17 Nov 17 Dec 17 Jan 18 Feb 18Jul 17 100 80 60 40 20 94.0079.00 90.1095.6093.7090.80 96.1086.70 17 Jun 17 Sep 17Aug 17 Oct 17 Nov 17 Dec 17 Jan 18 Feb 18Jul 17 AR 313.5.3. Patient Experience Domain The Patient Experience domain reports excellent performance in 2017-18. 100 per cent of patient complaints have been responded to within agreed time-scales. The Trust recognises that a swift response to complaints is important will be working in 2018-19 to bring response times down further. The Trust has achieved performance targets every month for both the nationally specifi ed Friends and Family test (Figure 1.11) and for the locally set target that at least 85 per cent of patients surveyed in the month report that their overall experience was either 'Very Good' or 'Excellent' (Figure 1.12). It is particularly pleasing to be able to report this high level of performance despite the pressures facing the NHS and the Trust over this year and the scores are a testament to the professionalism of front line staff.

Divisions and Teams can see disaggregated data showing their own satisfaction ratings and patient feedback allowing comparisons to be made between teams to drive improvements in performance. The number of patients who chose to respond to the survey each month varies. However throughout 2017-18 we have been able to get at least 900 and as many as 2200 responses per month which gives us assurance that the views reported are representative of a signifi cant number of patients. 3.5.4. Workforce and Effi ciency Domain Whilst the safety, quality and patient experience domains have reported good or excellent performance throughout the year some persistent challenges have been reported in the Workforce and Effi ciency domain, particularly relating to Vacancies (Figure 1.12), Sickness (Figure 1.14), compliance with Staff Appraisals (Figure 1.15) and patients experiencing Delayed Transfers of Care (Figure 1.16). However Agency Spend (Figure 1.17) and patient DNA (Did Not Attend) rates (Figure 1.17) have shown improvements on previous performance. Vacancies throughout the latter part of 17-18 have been infl ated by planning for organisational change. In particular the Transforming Care Together (TCT) programme has meant that many Corporate areas have held vacancies planning to recruit following completion of the programme. Other areas have held vacancies anticipating CRES restructures or decommissioning of services resulting in substantive staff requiring alternative roles to avoid redundancy. These held roles however have been identifi ed across the Trust and with the closure of the TCT programme a signifi cant increase in recruitment is planned over the fi rst two quarters of 18-19. Some clinical areas continue to experience issues, particularly with recruiting specialist staff and are covering vacancies with temporary staffi ng whilst continuing to seek substantive 9.10 9.10 9.008.40 9.179.209.809.00 9.409.80 Mar 18Apr 17 May 17 Jun 17 Sep 17Aug 17 Oct 17 Nov 17 Dec 17 Jan 18 Feb 18Jul 17 AR 33Figure 1.14: Staff Sickness Rate Figure 1.15: Staff Appraisal (PDR) RateAs shown in Figure 1.13 staff sickness has remained higher than target throughout the year across the Trust, although with particular hotspots in our Community Nursing and Learning Disability teams. Anxiety/stress and Musculo-skeletal problems are the key causes of sickness at present and the impact of increased community workload is believed to be a factor. Divisions continue to receive detailed breakdown of sickness by teams and are supported by HR Business Partners with completing sickness reviews, return to work interviews and support when the decision is made to conduct sickness panel hearings for persistent absences. The Trust makes occupational health support available to all staff and managers are encouraged to use this service to support staff. 8 76543210 4.60 6.26 6.65 6.334.98 6.096.095.495.00 5.945.43 5.81 Mar 18Apr 17 May 17 Jun 17 Sep 17Aug 17 Oct 17 Nov 17 Dec 17 Jan 18 Feb 18Jul 17 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 85.75 81.20 82.63 83.2983.10 83.4883.3181.9682.50 82.0181.00 17 Jun 17 Sep 17Aug 17 Oct 17 Nov 17 Dec 17 Jan 18 Feb 18Jul 17 AR 34Figure 1.16: Delayed Transfers of CareAn area of under-performance in 17-18 has been the delivery of Staff Appraisals or Personal Development Reviews (PDRs) within a 12 month rolling programme. NHS Community Indicators (February 18) shows the Trust averaging 82.3 per cent of staff with a PDR over the last 6 months compared to a Community Trust average of 85.6 per cent. This suggests that we are slightly under-performing compared to peers, although it is acknowledged that different organisational rules relating to recording of PDRs can make direct comparisons diffi cult in this area. Most divisions have reported breaches and are supported by reports identifying areas for increased focus and staff whose PDRs will soon expire. IT issues with recording completed PDRs on the Electronic Staff records (ESR) system have also been reported and divisions are running trials with 'expert users' to offer informal support to colleagues. Staff appraisals are recognised as a key component of good workforce planning and staff engagement and will continue to be an area of key focus. Delayed Transfers of Care are expressed as the percentage of overall Occupied Bed Days where the patient is medically fi t for discharge but is delayed for some other reason. As shown in Figure 1.16 the extent to which patients are delayed varies from month to month, however it has been above the Trust's internal target throughout 17-18. Delays impact negatively on the experience of patients in our care and can lead to delays discharging patients from acute hospitals if appropriate community beds are not available. The reasons for patient delays are complex and multi-factorial involving a range of NHS, Local Authority and Private stakeholders. Patients can be delayed due to lack of transport or because prescription medicines are not available, equally the cause of a delay could be under capacity in a Local Authority Social Care team, meaning that home assessments required to safely discharge a patient have not been made or concerns from patients and their families that an identifi ed care home is not suitable or in the wrong location. The Trust has updated its own Patient Choice policy in year and is working closely with Social Care and other colleagues across the local area to improve patient fl ows through the system. This area will continue to be monitored closely and is likely to a continuing challenge during 18-19.18 16 14 12 17 Jun 17 Sep 17Aug 17 Oct 17 Nov 17 Dec 17 Jan 18 Feb 18Jul 17 AR 35Figure 1.17: Spend on Agency Staff Figure 1.18: Patient DNA (Did Not Attend) ratesDespite the challenges highlighted earlier with vacancies and sickness rates the Trust has been successful in reducing spend on Agency Staff throughout 17-18. Agency staff are appropriate to use in some situations, however they are expensive and do not guarantee the same continuity of care which substantive staff provide. As shown in Figure 1.17 the Trust has not only managed to reduce Agency spend in 17-18 when compared to 16-17 (as shown by the red line in the graph above) but has also been able to stay beneath the NHS Improvement set reduction target for the Trust as shown by the green line. The reduction in Agency spend has resulted from improving the capacity of the Trust Bank to source high quality Bank staff and respond rapidly to Divisional requests for staff. It has also required changes to Divisional workforce planning and in some areas additional fl exibility from substantive staff. Based on learning from participation in the NHS Improvement '90 day Rostering Improvement Programme', further reduction targets have been set for 18-19 and we will continue to monitor performance in this area closely. 14,000 12,000 10,000 8,000 6,000 4,000 2,000 0 817.26 6,268.21 6,914.02 7,679.991,435.16 8,518.425,536.363,485.152,073.73 4,748.792,849.49 17 Jun 17 Sep 17Aug 17 Oct 17 Nov 17 Dec 17 Jan 6.526.88 6.70 Mar 18Apr 17 May 17 Jun 17 Sep 17Aug 17 Oct 17 Nov 17 Dec 17 Jan 18 Feb 18Jul 17 AR 36It is also positive to note that the Trust has managed to keep patient DNA (Did Not Attend) rates low throughout the year. DNAs waste clinical capacity and good communication with patients are key to reducing these. The Trust has focussed on communications with the introduction of text messaging reminders in many areas with further roll outs planned to continue. Additionally communication with patients in advance about the impact of DNAs, options for partial booking of appointments and prompt liaison with referring GPs or other healthcare professional when their patients do DNA are all key to continuing to manage performance in this area. 3.6 Equality and Human Rights The Trust's Equality, Diversity and Human Rights (EDHR) Strategy is a two year strategy (2016-18) which outlines the EDHR aims of BCHC and how these align to the overall strategic aims of the Trust. In this document the Trust commits to the following equality pledges: 1. Ensuring full compliance with the provisions of the Equality Act 2010 and the Human Rights Act 1998 and related civil and criminal legislation. 2. Ensuring fair access to, and treatment by , Trust services, and the maintenance of patient and carer human rights for all in the population served by the Trust. 3. Ensuring fair treatment and the maintenance of human rights of all T rust staff in all aspects of their employment with the Trust. 4. Ensuring there is an appropriate understanding of the changing nature of the population the organisation serves and the need to adapt and tailor its services to meet the health needs and challenges that arise from these changes, as well as having a workforce reflecting the diversity therein. 5. Being an ethical and socially responsible organisation, actively demonstrating transparency , accountability and openness on matters related to Equality, Diversity and Human Rights. AR 37During 2017-18 the Trust has built on the progress made in previous years which had established a strong governance structure in this area of work. The nationally mandated Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES) continued to develop with metrics showing steady improvement in the majority of areas. Innovative practices such as the Cultural Ambassador programme have begun to be implemented, designed to address equality issues identified in employment relations cases. The Trust is at the forefront of this work being a pilot Trust for the scheme and receiving valuable support from the Royal College of Nursing (RCN). In line with national legislative requirements, the Trust has also published its Gender Pay Gap which, based on staff in post on 31 March 2017, showed a 0 per cent median pay gap and a 13.15 per cent mean pay gap, which show the Trust fares far better than the majority of other NHS organisations. During 2017-18 the Trust has also achieved Disability Confident Employer accreditation and has progressed to working towards becoming a Disability Confident Leader. This represents positive progress towards becoming a more inclusive employer and the experience of staff with disabilities continues to be a focussed area of work with the introduction of the nationally mandated Workforce Disability Equality Standard (WDES). The Trust is currently producing a full Annual Equality Report which will be published in July 2018 and will be available via the Trust's website. This will provide further detail of the work being undertaken in the field of EDHR within the Trust. AR 38Signed on behalf of the Board: Richard Kirby, Accountable OfficerDated: 24th May 20183.7. Overseas Operations Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust has not been engaged in any overseas operations during 2017-18. 3.8. Sustainable Development Report The Trust is continuing to deliver and improve on its environmental and energy reduction programme and has successfully secured capital finances to continue with carbon reduction schemes which have included continued installations of LED lighting across in patient wards and community site along with energy efficient backlog maintenance schemes including high efficiency-low emission heating. Further work to improve Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS) and develop more efficient waste management have also been implemented to help support land fill and waste volume reduction. The Trust has been working on developing new 'Sustainable Travel and Transport Plans' to implement during 2018 which supports and promotes sustainable and low carbon transportation models. The Trust continuing commitment in carbon reduction and providing sustainable environments will continue into the new financial operating period with successful allocation and programmes of works with the continuation of a range of sustainable schemes. The NHS Sustainable Development Unit's 'Carbon Reduction Strategy' will continue to be used as a target and benchmark in the reduction of carbon emissions and sustainable development. All Trust energy and waste usage/metrics are reported and identified within the Department of Health's annual Estates Return and Information Collection (ERIC) return.

Governor Expenses Governors are unpaid and volunteer part-time on behalf of the Trust that they represent. The Trust has a procedure in place under which Governors may be reimbursed for legitimate travel expenses in the course of their duties as Governors of Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. Nineteen of the twenty-three Governors who comprise the Council of Governors are eligible to claim expenses, as the Trust does not reimburse Partner Governors. In 2016-17, three Governors made claim under this process totalling an aggregate sum of \u00a3225.96. During the period of 2017-18, four Governors made claims of an aggregate sum of which amounted to \u00a3408.08. 1.5. Statement as to Disclosure to Auditors Each Director of the Board is able to confirm that, to the best of their individual and collective knowledge, there is no relevant audit information of which the NHS body's auditors are unaware, and each has taken all the necessary steps as a director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information, and to establish that the NHS body's auditors are aware of this information. Members of the Board of Directors have made such enquiries of his/her fellow directors and of the Trust's auditors as are required by his/her duty as a director of the Trust to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence for that purpose. AR 601.6. Income Disclosures as Required by Section 43 (2A) of the NHS Act 2006 In accordance with Section 43(2A) of the NHS Act 2006 (as amended by the Health and Social Care Act 2012) the income that Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust received during 2017-18 for provision of goods and services for the purposes of the health service in England was greater than its income for the provision of goods and services for any other purpose. 1.7. Disclosures relating to NHS Improvement's Well Led Framework The Trust has had regard to the views of Governors and has considered the NHSI Well Led Framework in its evaluation of performance, review of internal control systems and the Board Assurance Framework. Further details of these are discussed in more detail within the Annual Governance Statement in Section 11 of this report. The Board has rigorous risk and performance assessment and escalation processes embedded through the Trust that ensure timely reporting and mitigating action where required. Action plans, where appropriate, are in place to improve quality and these are monitored by the Board and its Committees. The Board has undertaken a self-assessment against the Well Led Framework during the year and has developed and monitors progress against improvement actions identified. Signed on behalf of the Board: Date: 24th May 2018 Richard Kirby, Chief Executive Officer AR 61Section 3 Remuneration Report This section in the Annual Report has been compiled in accordance with Section 420 to 422 requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Regulation 11 and Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008. 1. Remuneration Policy The Nomination and Remuneration Sub Committee of the Trust Board is responsible for determining the pay and terms of conditions of employment for Executive Directors and for any senior managers not subject to national Agenda for Change Terms and Conditions. It is the policy of the Trust that all senior managers will be employed on national Agenda for Change conditions, with the exception of those designated as Executive Directors of the Trust Board. In determining its pay policy for 2017-18 the Trust considered the nancial restraints and constraints within the health and social care sector, pay awards applied to other senior manager posts and guidance from the NHS Improvement. In 2017-18, the Council of Governors considered the remuneration and terms and conditions of the Trust Board Chair and Non-Executive Directors. 2.

AR 644. Pay Multiples As an NHS Foundation Trust we are required to disclose the relationship between the remuneration of the highest-paid Director in the Trust and the median remuneration of the Trust's workforce. The banded remuneration of the highest paid director in Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust in the financial year 2017-18 was \u00a3183,314.60 (\u00a3181,648.50 in 2016-17). This was 6.6 times (6.6 times in 2016-17) the median remuneration of the workforce, which was \u00a327,635 (\u00a327,361 in 2016-17). In 2017-18, none of our employees received remuneration in excess of the highest-paid director; this was the same in 2016-17. Total remuneration includes salary, non-consolidated performance-related pay, benefits-in-kind as well as severance payments. It does not include employer pension contributions and the cash equivalent transfer value of pensions. In 2017-18 the number of staff in the sample was 4,929 compared with 5,028 in 2016-17 and 5,032 in 2015-16. Although agency staff that are utilised to cover vacancies should be included in the analysis of staff in calculating the median, the Trust does not analyse the reasons that agency staff are required, and agency staff have therefore been excluded from the calculation of the median salary. The figures reported here have been subject to audit. 5. Compensation on Early Retirement or for Loss of Office No exit packages or severance payments have been made to any very senior managers or past or present Executive Directors. This statement has been audited. AR 656. Payments to Past Directors No payments have been made to any past very senior managers or Executive Directors. This statement has been audited. 7. Nomination and Remuneration Committee The Nomination and remuneration Committee has membership of all Non-Executive Directors including the Chair. Following a review of the Committee's Terms of Reference in year, the purpose of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee remains that of; making recommendations to the Board of Directors in relation to the appointment and remuneration of the Chief Executive, Executive Directors and other senior managers reporting directly to the Chief Executive and reviewing and making recommendations on the Board's balance and skill mix; taking into account the future challenges, risks and opportunities facing the Trust and the skills and expertise that are required within the Board to meet them. The Committee is also responsible for ensuring that adequate Executive succession planning arrangements are in place. The Committee has not employed the services of external advisors in executing its duties in year and has not incurred any fees in this respect. The Committee reviewed the Terms and Conditions surrounding the appointment of a new Chief Executive Offi cer who took up post on 1st March 2018, making recommendation on the same to the Board of Directors and subsequently to the Council of Governors for approval. Chair Nomination and Remuneration Committee signature Date: 24th May 2018Tom Storrow, Chairman AR 668. Audit Committee The purpose of the Committee is to focus upon monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of over- arching systems of financial and corporate governance, internal control, assurance processes and risk management across the whole of the Trust's activities (clinical and non-clinical) both generally and in support of the Annual Governance Statement; and to provide assurance to the Board of Directors thereon. To this end, the Audit Committee receives reports from the Quality Governance and Risk Committee and the Finance Performance and Assurance Committee on a regular basis. The Audit Committee extended the existing provisions for Internal Audit services during the year and recommended to the Board of Directors that Coventry and Warwickshire Audit Services were re-appointed as Internal Auditors commencing April 2017 for a period of three years. The Committee did not engage any specialist or legal services in the execution of its duties during the year. The Committee considered the following key areas of work during the year: Inter nal and External Audit programmes including security and anti-fraud work plans; Risk management and assurance pr ocesses including the Board Assurance Framework, systems of internal control, Head of Internal Audit Opinion and the development of the Annual Governance Statement; Maintenance of statutory r egisters and compliance with Standing Orders and Standing Financial Instructions; Assurance r eports arising from partnership working across the Black Country and Dudley and Walsall. As the Trust was facing a potential major transaction during the year, the Board of Directors took the view that they would take stock of the collective External Auditor arrangements post transaction. On that basis, the Board made recommendation to the Council of Governors that the existing External Auditor arrangements with Ernst and Young be rolled over for a further year. This recommendation was approved by Governors.

Disabled Persons The Trusts Recruitment Policy and guidelines sets out the Trusts commitment to ensuring that all staff, including those who are disabled are treated fairly and equitably in relation to the appointment processes. The Trust maintains Two-Ticks accreditation, guaranteeing an interview for disabled persons who meet the person specification and to ensure reasonable adjustments are made. The Trust has an Equality and Diversity and Human Rights Strategy and Policy, which ensures that disabled persons have equal access to development and support. The Sickness Absence Policy and Occupational Health service ensure that staff who become disabled are given appropriate training, support and redeployment opportunities. The Trust monitors its employment and policies to ensure actions are taken to avoid unlawful discrimination whether direct or indirect. 2. Sickness Absence The Trust Board has continued to have a focus on the management of Sickness Absence during 2017-18. Sickness Absence Key Performance Indicators are monitored at all levels in the organisation and each Clinical Division has in place comprehensive action plans. Such plans include support and training to line managers, a comprehensive health and wellbeing programme and a focus on stress management. The Trusts programme includes an external Occupational Health Service, Fast Track Physiotherapy and Staff Counselling services for staff. 'Average days lost' through sickness was 5.51 per cent during the year.

Redundancy and other departure costs have been paid in accordance with the provisions of the NHS Scheme. Exit costs in this note are accounted for in full in the year of departure. Where the organisation has agreed early retirements, the additional costs are met by the organisation and not by the NHS pensions scheme. Ill-health retirement costs are met by the NHS pensions scheme and are not included in the table. AR 714. Off Payroll Engagements The intermediaries legislation (known as IR35), was introduced in 2000 to make sure that people who do the same job in the same manner pay similar amounts of income tax and National Insurance as those directly employed by an organisation. This requirement is irrespective of whether they're employed directly or they work through an intermediary, such as their own limited company, a personal service company or partnership. Until 6th April 2017, it was the responsibility of the individual to ensure that they pay the appropriate level of tax and national insurance and provide assurance to the Trust that this is undertaken. The Government believe that the IR35 tax rules are not always consistent in their application and have changed the rules making the responsibility for the calculation and payment of tax and national insurance the responsibility of the engaging/employing organisation, i.e. The Trust and not the individual. This change in legislation is mandatory and affects all public sector organisations and applies to payments made from April 6th 2017, irrespective of when the service started. The change in these rules were incorporated into the Finance Act 2017 and the National Insurance Contributions legislation which means this is law and where HMRC identify non-compliance this will result in the award of financial penalties. The Trust's Temporary Staffing Department follows an internal assessment process supported by the HMRC assessment tool in accordance with the 'Guidance for Determining the Contractual Status of Workers' document which is available on the Trust intranet. The table below outlines all new off-payroll engagements, or those that reached six months in duration, between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018, for more than \u00a3245 per day and that last for longer than six months.

Expenditure on Consultancy The Trust spent \u00a32,450k on Consultancy during 2017-18. 7. Countering Fraud and Corruption Our Local Anti-Fraud Service is provided by our Internal Audit Service and we have an annual plan of work that is compliant with the Secretary of State's directions. This is aimed at preventing and detecting fraud and ensuring that we take action where necessary. AR 738. Modern Slavery Act 2015 Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust is a publicly funded organisation and does not engage in service provision in order to make a profit. Whilst some services operate on a commercial basis i.e. canteen services at our in-patient community hospital sites, they only generate a modest income and these services are not considered commercial under the Act as they do not generate income in excess of \u00a336 million per annum. A statement on the steps the Trust has taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in the Trust's supply chain or any part of the Trust's business is therefore not required. 9. Staff Survey Results 2017 The 2017 staff survey results are summarised in the table below: This year the Trust responded to feedback from staff, including the BME Staff Network, and for the first time in five years conducted a full census survey (inviting all staff to participate). We achieved 1868 responses resulting in a return rate of 40 per cent, with 4713 staff invited to complete the survey. In 2016 the Trust conducted a sample survey of 1250 staff with 490 responding also equating to a 40 per cent response rate. Therefore our real numbers response rate has greatly increased and will provide a greater depth of data for analysis; however our response rate remains below the national average of community trusts (50 per cent). This year's staff survey action plan will deliver a targeted approach at divisional and corporate service level to promote the importance and value of completing the staff survey.

Listening into Action (LiA) has produced a scatter map (Appendix 3) and league table for all 17 Community Trusts. Overall we are ranked 12th out of 17 trusts, which is an improved position from last year (14th). The national trend is that staff members feel less positive generally from last year and there has been a broad deterioration across the community sector with a few exceptions.

The following nine priorities have been agreed by Trust Board for specic focus in the 17-18 Staff Survey Action Plan: 9.1. Appraisal and support for development The focus during 2018 will be to support the divisions to improve the uptake and quality of appraisals so that all divisions are able to reach at least the national average comparator score. 9.2. Equality and Diversity The priority for action will be to increase the per cent of people believing the organisation provides equal opportunities for career progression and promotion to at least the national average comparator score. Work is currently under way to develop and deliver a range of talent management and succession planning strategies in line with our current WRES and WDES plans. The organisation has currently commissioned a review of our equality policies and procedures, which includes within the scope equal opportunities for career progression and promotion.

Errors and Incidents This is a new organisational priority for action, which will focus on increasing the per cent of staff reporting errors, near misses or incidents and provide reassurance about how these would be handled, to encourage and reassure staff that their concerns will be treated seriously and with transparency. 9.4. Health and Wellbeing Reducing work related stress would remain an organisational priority. This year's focus will be on introducing new interventions to support the physical and mental health and wellbeing of our staff including the implementation of a Recovery College model in a health and wellbeing hub and working as a system partner to deliver the BSOL STP staff health and wellbeing priorities for action. 9.5. Working patterns Whilst the Trusts overall score have improved additional support will be provided for the two divisions that have scored above the national comparator average for per cent working extra hours. 9.6. Job satisfaction The organisational priority for action will be to increase effective team working and staff motivation levels to at least the national average comparator score in the 2018 staff survey results. 9.7. Managers The priority for action will be to work with the divisions and corporate areas to increase the recognition and value of staff by managers and increase support provided by immediate managers during 2018 to achieve at least the national average comparator score. There is already work AR 77underway to develop a Cultural Inclusion and Staff Engagement Strategy and plan for 2018. 9.8. Patient care and experience This year the organisational focus will be on increasing the per cent of staff members who feel their role makes a difference to patients and service users to above the national average. As well as delivering the quarterly staff Friends and Family Test we will also be undertaking a staff cultural temperature check throughout the year to enable on-going staff engagement in the improvement of patient care and experience. 9.9. Violence, harassment and bullying Reducing violence, harassment and bullying will remain an organisational priority. This year's focus will be on undertaking a deep dive against the 6 key ndings and to engage a range of stakeholders in the development and delivery of a priority action plan. In response to feedback from staff, the action planning process has been designed to be more inclusive than in previous years, with a schedule of stakeholder engagement events planned during 2018. 9.10. Next Steps During 2018 a schedule of 'Big Conversation' staff engagement events will be held to share the staff survey results and priorities and enable staff to share their experiences and let us know what would improve their working life. The conversations will inform the refresh of our vision and values and our service strategies and support the development and delivery of the Cultural Inclusion and Staff Engagement Strategy. We will be utilising a 'Pulse Check' tool in order for us to monitor levels of staff engagement and how valued staff feel. A Task Force approach and structure is being implemented to deliver the priorities for action, led by the Director of Strategy and Transformation, Human Resources Director and Executive Director of Nursing and Therapies. Progress will be reported on a quarterly basis to Quality, Governance and Risk Committee (QGRC) and Management Board and will be shared regularly with staff through the current 'You Said, We Did' staff engagement campaign. 2017-18 Staff recommend BCHC as a place to work Q1 60%Q2 62%Q3 59%Q4 59% B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B B I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I G conversation Fit for The 2022 AR 789.11.

During this year a number of health and safety policies have been reviewed including the Health and Safety at Work General Policy and the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Policy. Regular health and safety related articles are included in the monthly Risk management newsletter 'Compass'. Health and safety training is provided on both a regular basis as part of the Trust's Induction Programme and on an ad-hoc basis or on request by staff. The Trust Health and Safety Committee meets every six weeks and reviews incidents and risks and mandatory training compliance; reporting to the Risk Management Committee and Quality Governance and Risk Committee. The Trust Health and Safety Annual Report is presented to Trust Board. The Trust Board also receive an annual health and safety update/briefi ng session.BIG conversation Fit for The 2022Date: 24th May 2018 Richard Kirby, Chief Executive Offi cer Date: 24th May 2018 Peter Axon, Chief Finance Offi cer AR 79Section 5 Corporate Governance Report The Board of Directors is responsible for setting the strategic direction and the leadership of the Trust. Collectively, the Board has the responsibility for ensuring the delivery of this strategy within Trust which has an organisational culture that is supportive of meeting the needs of the people we serve. Corporate governance is the means by which they do this. Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust has applied the principles of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance on a 'comply or explain' basis. The NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance, most recently revised in July 2014, is based on the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code issued in 2012. 1. Disclosures set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust has applied the principles of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance on a 'comply or explain' basis. The NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance (July 2014) reflects the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 and aims to promote best governance practice. Whilst the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance is a guidance document, it requires that Foundations Trusts disclose any deviation from it; providing a reason for deviation from the Code and explanation as to how alternative arrangements meet the requirements of the Code. The Board of Directors implements the Code of Governance through a number of key governance documents and policies which include: The Constitution Standing Or ders and Standing Financial Instructions Scheme of Delegation and Matters Reserved to the Boar d Code of Conduct - Boar d of Directors and Council of Governors Gifts, Hospitality and Commer cial Sponsorship Policy Annual Plan The Boar d Committee Governance structure 2. The Board of Directors The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing the strategy of the Trust and for the operation of the Trust's business; ensuring compliance with the Trust's Constitution, NHS Improvement's Provider License, statutory requirements and contractual obligations. Details of the composition of the Board of Directors are set out in Section 1 of the Annual Report with details of the Board Committee arrangements and attendance by individual Directors. Details of Director Terms of Office and remuneration are outlined in Sections 1 and 2 of the Annual Report respectively. AR 803. The Council of Governors The Council of Governors represents the interests of those we serve and partner organisations and has a duty to hold the Non-Executive Directors individually and collectively to account for the performance of the Board of Directors; providing and gaining feedback on the Trust's performance to the stakeholder organisations and members. The Chair of the Council of Governors is also the Chair of the Board of Directors and is responsible for the performance of Non-Executive Directors. The Council of Governors receive the Trust's Annual Report and Accounts and has responsibility for conducting an Annual Members meeting. Members of the Council of Governors and the Constituencies they represent are detailed in Section 2 of the Annual Report. 4. Information and Evaluation The Board of Directors has in place a programme of Board Seminars in which it regularly receives direct feedback from patients, service users and carers. This programme also provides the opportunity for board development and mandatory training. The Board of Directors undertakes an annual review of the performance and committee Terms of Reference in order to inform future information requirements and governance arrangements and to establish an annual Cycle of Business. Individual members of the Board participate in appraisal processes, the outcome of which is reported to the Executive Remuneration Committee or Council of Governors as appropriate. AR 815. Compliance with the Code The Trust has been compliant with the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance throughout the year. With exception of the following areas: B8.1 - The Remuneration Committee should not agree to an Executive member of the board leaving the employment of the Foundation Trust except in accordance with the terms of their contract of employment including but not limited to service of their full notice period without the Board having completed and approved a full risk assessment. The Board of Directors were satisfied that interim arrangements were sufficient to enable the Chief Executive Officer to take up post within another NHS Trust and provide stability for the Trust until a substantive appointment was made. 6. Information Governance As an NHS organisation Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust holds personal information about its staff, its patients and service users. The Trust does not underestimate the responsibility that this brings and treats the security of this data with the seriousness that it deserves. The Trust has a range of policies and procedures in place to ensure that staff know how to use and to safely store personal information, and that they do so in accordance with the law and best practice. The Trust is delighted to report that once again in 2017-18 we have achieved level 2 compliance with the Information Governance Toolkit requirement. The toolkit is a national initiative aimed at improving data security across the NHS and achievement of level 2 demonstrates that the Trust has systems and policies in place across a range of measures; data security being one, and that these have been appropriately implemented. During 2017-18 Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust reported one Level 2 Information Governance incident requiring notification to the Information Commissioner in respect of records taken from a staff member's car in January 2018. The incident is undergoing comprehensive internal investigation and outcomes and improvement actions will be reported appropriately to the Information Governance Steering Group and Quality, Governance and Risk Committee. AR 827. Stakeholder Relations BCHC has been working actively and prominently within a number of key partnership arrangements across Birmingham and the wider region, recognising the importance of such collaboration to help shape the future provision of healthcare. The trust is committed to playing a leading and effective role, both for the organisation and for community services, in our main local Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP) in Birmingham and Solihull as well as continuing to play an important role in the neighbouring Black Country and West Birmingham STP . We have also been actively engaged in working with two 'vanguard' initiatives, namely Modality and the Dudley Multi-specialty Community Provider, as well as working alongside a number of primary care federations across our geographical area. 7.1. Transforming Care Together Partnership On 1st March 2018 the Trust Board agreed that the planned acquisition of Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust (the 'Transforming Care Together' partnership) would not proceed. The key factors taken into account in reaching this decision were: strategic fit - r ecent NHS planning guidance for 2018-19 has highlighted the strengthening role of Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships (STPs) in developing models of care appropriate to their geographical footprints, and the TCT proposal would have operated across two (namely Birmingham and Solihull and the Black Country); clinical concer ns - discussions around how best to integrate the three Trusts' clinical areas have raised a number of challenges for all three organisations; financial - the financial plan for the integrated organisation would not meet the r equirements that are set for the transaction. 7.2. Dudley Multispecialty Community Provider BCHC continues to be a partner in the procurement process for the Dudley MCP , working in partnership with Dudley GPs and The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust in the development of the MCP clinical and business model. BCHC is exploring how it can support the new MCP entity to transform its community services in order to deliver the new model of care, which aims to go live in September 2019. AR 837.3. Birmingham and Solihull Sustainability and Transformation Plan (STP) During 2017-18 BCHC has actively supported the refresh of the Birmingham and Solihull STP , which was approved by the Programme Board in April 2018, and which sets out the vision for 'Live Healthy, Live Happy' across the STP . Following approval this revised vision will go out for wider public consultation. In the meantime the Trust will continue to work with staff and our partners to ensure our own Trust values and vision refresh aligns with the STP's priorities for action. During 2018-19, we expect to be leading the following developments alongside partners to support the overall STP vision: Coor dinating health and social care into a locality framework, aligning primary, secondary and community care with the local authorities and third sector. This will build upon our established relationships with emerging primary care organisations and our expertise in delivery of community based models of care, to establish multidisciplinary teams across partner organisations to remove barriers in the care and support system Pr omoting the 'home-first' ethos, so that we stop the focus on institutional beds being the main place to receive help. This will include playing our part on the Recovery, Reablement and Rehabilitation programme being developed through the STP , and addressing recommendations made in the forthcoming CQC system wide review of urgent care in Birmingham and Solihull T ransforming the model of healthcare for children through the creation of community based models (virtual and physical) across primary and social care. These will have a clear focus on the prevention of key risk factors and will provide support for self-management and self-prevention from an early age, including diet, exercise, mental well-being and school readiness. In 2018-19 we will continue the integration and transformation of Health Visiting and Children's Centres services on a locality (district) basis, through the new Birmingham Forward Steps Partnership, and Thr ough our Learning Disability service supporting the delivery of the Transforming Care programme for Birmingham and Solihull including in 2018-19 delivering on the investment- enhanced community based intensive support services Enablers: Digital - W e continue to make progress in the system wide goal of a single shared patient record across the STP . In March 2018 we went live with 'Your Care Connected', which will allow doctors, nurses and other registered healthcare professionals working in community settings to view relevant information from a patient's GP and hospital record, with the patient's consent, to provide better, safer care. With our Birmingham Forward Steps partnership, we are launching single child record across health visiting and Children's Centres from June 2018. Strategic appr oach to estates - We are working across the STP to link future capital/infrastructure investment to the system wide plan. AR 847.4. Black Country Sustainability and Transformation Plan (STP) The focus of the Black Country STP (including West Birmingham) is around developing place based new care models (such as primary acute care systems (PACS) or multi-disciplinary community providers (MCP) integrating primary, community, social care and acute provision on a locality basis. In West Birmingham, BCHC is a formal partner with Modality Partnership through the Connected Care Partnership, working alongside Sandwell and West Birmingham CCG and Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust in a multi-specialty community provider vanguard site, to implement and embed new models of care to improve primary and community care access and infrastructure, increase access through the use of technology and design and implement integrated care pathways. During 2018-19 we will continue to work through partnership to develop and embed new care models within West Birmingham, working towards developing an alliance agreement across the partnership in 2018-19. 8. NHS Improvements Single Oversight Framework NHS Improvement's Single Oversight Framework provides the framework for overseeing providers and identifying potential support needs. The framework looks at five themes: Quality of car e Finance and use of r esources Operational performance Strategic change Leadership and impr ovement capability (well-led) Based on information from these themes, providers are segmented from 1 to 4, where '4' reflects providers receiving the most support, and '1' reflects providers with maximum autonomy. A foundation trust will only be in segments 3 or 4 where it has been found to be in breach or suspected breach of its licence. 8.1. Segmentation Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust has been placed in Segment 1. The Trust has not received any enforcement or improvement notices during the year. This segmentation information is the Trust's position as at 31st March 2018. Current segmentation information for NHS Trusts and Foundation Trusts is published on the NHS Improvement website. 8.2. Finance and Use of Resources The finance and use of resources theme is based on the scoring of five measures from '1' to '4', where '1' reflects the strongest performance. These scores are then weighted to give an overall score. Given that finance and use of resources is only one of the five themes feeding into the Single Oversight Framework, the segmentation of the Trust disclosed above might not be the same as the overall finance score here.

Membership Membership supports the Trust to be more locally accountable to those we serve. Our public membership remains open to all residents of the wider West Midlands region who are aged 16 or above. Our staff membership is open to all staff who are employed by the Trust under a contract of employment which has no fixed term or has a fixed term of at least 12 months; or have been continuously employed by the Trust under a contract of employment for at least 12 months. Our membership is represented by 13 elected public Governors and 6 elected staff members, who are joined by 4 appointed partner Governors and the Trust's Chairman to comprise our Council of Governors. The principal role of the Council of Governors is to hold the Board of Directors to account for the performance of the Trust through the Non-Executive Directors and to represent the interests of our members and the communities we serve. In the latter part of 2017-18 we said goodbye to two Governors, John Leghorn and Tony Petrou, who stepped down to undertake new opportunities. We are thankful for their commitment during their term of office, especially as they had supported us to establish new processes, and wish them well in their new endeavours. In addition, we confirmed the appointment of Ronnie Meechan as a Partner Governor who had previously been covering the role on an interim basis. The membership of our Council of Governors during 2017-18 is detailed in Table 1.16. Examples of how the Council of Governors has been active in their role during 2017-18 are: Formal meetings of the Council of Governors have been held on a quarterly basis in public; receiving appropriate information to enable them to discharge their statutory responsibilities. The Council of Gover nors has formally established and appointed sub-committees Chairs and Vice Chairs to support their roles and elected Peter Mayer as Lead Governor.

The Nominations and Remuneration Committee for Non-Executive Dir ectors led a non-executive director recruitment campaign in Spring 2017 and Non-Executive Director re-appointment process in Autumn 2017; resulting in the Council of Governors appointing Simon Murphy as a new Non-Executive Director and re-appointing Tom Storrow as Chairman, Jerry Gould as Vice Chair for one additional year and Neil Scott as Non-Executive Director for an additional three years. Gover nors participated in the appointment process for our new Chief Executive Officer, with the Council of Governors granting their approved for the appointment of Richard Kirby to this role. The establishment of short life working gr oups have assisted Governors to examine areas of work in more detail and informed recommendations to the full Council. W ith the support of the Governor Transforming Care Together (TCT) working group, Governors delivered a work plan to scrutinise each step of the Board's consideration of the acquisition proposal to ensure it was thorough and comprehensive with the interests of members and the public being considered as part of the decision- making process. The work of Governors also included working with Governors and Shadow Governors from the partner Trusts to develop a future membership model that would have ensured a potential organisation with an expanded geographical footprint would have remained representative. The Council of Governors of BCHC welcomed the assurances they had received from the Board of Directors during this process that it would be ensure it would make the right decision for BCHC; including the decision not to proceed. Gover nors undertook their annual evaluation of their own effectiveness as a Council of Governors; ensuring compliance with their regulatory and statutory responsibilities. This review identified progress made since the previous year and informed the focus of Governor Annual Away Day and priorities for the coming year. In addition, this process supports Governors to continue to inform their annual development plan, which is supported by the Trust to ensure Governors have the knowledge and skills to deliver their role. An informal Gover nor led discussion group has met five times during the year to support the triangulation of information from individual Governor activities. The group also provides a forum for Governors to seek further information to support informed debates, and their development. Gover nors' views on the forward direction of the Trust were sought through an initial session with the Director of Strategy and Transformation, followed by the active participation of Governors in the Board of Directors' annual strategic planning day. Gover nors have been effecting change through their active participation in a range of activities; including bi-monthly Patient Safety Visits with Board members and their observation of the Board meeting and its sub-committees in order to witness the performance of the Non-Executive Directors and Board of Directors at work. Our Gover nors are available at membership and staff engagement activities to listen to the views of the members and public they represent. We have been please by the national interest in the success of our staff governor role which has been effective in raising the voice of our Healthcare Assistants and Support Staff in our organisation. A register of Council of Governor interests is contained within Table 1.16 of this Annual Report and the attendance record for the Council of Governors is available on request from the Corporate Governance Team.

During 2017-18, we continued to offer members a range of activities in order to have their say and provide opportunities to engage with us; shaping our patient information leaflets, strategies and research. Members have shared with us their views on our quality priorities for the coming year. A focus of our engagement activities during 2017-18 has been on exploring the feasibility of the Transforming Care Together acquisition. We shared updates and invited members to a series of drop in sessions to hear their views on the proposal. For those services which would have been directly affected, members were invited to join engagement events about these services. A number of members regularly attend and annually review and shape our governor led Patient Experience Forum. In this Forum members work with us to improve the experience patients have of our services and actively get involved in writing our Quality Account. Providing opportunities for our members to be as active as they wish is important to us and we seek feedback to inform what we do. In response to feedback we have re-launched our newsletter and regularly connect with our members through a briefing email, in line with how our members have told us they wish us to communicate with them.

Statement of the Chief Executive's Responsibilities as the Accounting Officer of Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust The NHS Act 2006 states that the Chief Executive is the Accounting Officer of the NHS foundation trust. The relevant responsibilities of the Accounting Officer, including their responsibility for the propriety and regularity of public finances for which they are answerable, and for the keeping of proper accounts, are set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum issued by NHS Improvement. NHS Improvement, in exercise of the powers conferred on Monitor by the NHS Act 2006, has given Accounts Directions which require Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust to prepare for each financial year a Statement of Accounts in the form and on the basis required by those Directions. The Accounts are prepared on an accruals basis and must give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust and of its income and expenditure, total recognised gains and losses and cash flows for the financial year. In preparing the Accounts, the Accounting Officer is required to comply with the requirements of the Department of Health Group Accounting Manual and in particular to: observe the Accounts Dir ection issued by NHS Improvement, including the relevant accounting and disclosure requirements, and apply suitable accounting policies on a consistent basis; make judgements and estimates on a reasonable basis; state whether applicable accounting standar ds as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual (and the Department of Health Group Accounting Manual) have been followed, and disclose and explain any material departures in the financial statements; ensur e that the use of public funds complies with the relevant legislation, delegated authorities and guidance; and pr epare the financial statements on a going concern basis. The Accounting Officer is responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the NHS foundation trust and to enable him/her to ensure that the Accounts comply with requirements outlined in the above mentioned Act. The Accounting Officer is also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the NHS foundation trust and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. To the best of my knowledge and belief, I have properly discharged the responsibilities set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum. Date: 24th May 2018 Richard Kirby, Chief Executive Officer AR 9111. Annual Governance Statement as of 31st March 2018 11.1 Scope of Responsibility As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal control that supports the achievement of the NHS foundation trust's policies, aims and objectives, whilst safeguarding the public funds and departmental assets for which I am personally responsible, in accordance with the responsibilities assigned to me. I am also responsible for ensuring that the NHS foundation trust is administered prudently and economically and that resources are applied efficiently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum. 11.2. The Purpose of the System of Internal Control The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure to achieve policies, aims and objectives; it can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an ongoing process designed to identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of the policies, aims and objectives of Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, to evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised and the impact should they be realised, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and economically. The system of internal control has been in place in Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust for the year ended 31 March 2018 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. 11.3. Capacity to Handle Risk Executive level leadership of the Risk Management function and processes within the Trust is the responsibility of the Chief Executive. Operational leadership of the risk management process is undertaken by the Corporate Governance Director, who supports both a dedicated central Risk Management Team and delivery of the Risk Management Strategy and organisational objectives at a service level. The majority of risk management training is provided to staff in order that they are able to undertake their specific role and responsibilities e.g. incident reporting, medical devices management. However, other risk management related training forms part of staff Mandatory Training e.g. Health and Safety, Fire Safety, Manual Handling. AR 92The Trust ensures that its range of training programmes effectively raises the profile and understanding of risk identification, assessment and management, and clearly demonstrates to all colleagues across the Trust, how their routine and consistent application of risk management processes will serve as a key enabler to ensuring continuous improvement in the quality of the Trust's delivered care. This standard applies whether the corresponding training is specific to risk (including therefore, the Trust's mandatory risk management training module), or whether it is principally dedicated to other subjects or specialisms that nevertheless benefit from supporting coverage of risk. The commitment to increasing all colleagues' awareness of their personal responsibilities for risk management is enhanced by a proactive and on-going programme of communications across the Trust that seeks to reinforce appreciation for the value and significance of risk management outcomes. Specialist risk management training has been delivered across the organisation in a range of settings and using a variety of methodologies, albeit with clear focus upon self-service training which enables colleagues to access the information and support that they need, where and when this is most convenient and appropriate to them. More specifically, an overview of risk management systems and processes is included within the induction programme that is mandatory for all new Trust colleagues. Furthermore, in order to augment the Trust's risk management training programmes and to provide additional or supplemental advice and support on all issues related to risk, detailed guidance materials and resources are maintained on the Trust intranet. The Trust ensures that its risk management training is appropriate to fulfil the personal development needs of all colleagues. This is equally applicable whether the training is being provided to frontline colleagues within operational teams who need to understand how to identify, report and escalate operational risks within their services, or whether the training is more specialist and therefore targeted at meeting the needs of those Trust colleagues with specific role-based responsibility for risk management, such as the Head of Information Governance and the Head of Risk Management. AR 9311.4. The Risk and Control Framework The Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust Risk Management Strategy 2015-18, ensures that Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust maintains clear oversight in its management of strategic and operational risks (both clinical and non-clinical) in order to safeguard against the occurrence of adverse effects which may otherwise impact upon the quality of Trust services, as well as upon service user safety and experience. Risk Management is rightfully recognised by the Trust as a key enabler to ensuring continuous improvement in the quality of delivered care. The Trust maintains a number of formal processes and systems by which it seeks to manage both strategic and operational risk. These include: Trust policies and procedures, Risk registers that are maintained electronically via the Datix software system and that capture all risks (both clinical and non-clinical), together with a Board Assurance Framework that identifi es strategic risks, The appointment of key individuals to oversee risk processes on behalf of the Trust, including the Corporate Governance Director, Head of Risk Management and Emergency Planning, the Risk Management Team and Divisional/Service Governance Leads, and A number of key forums with specifi c responsibilities for relevant aspects of risk, which include the Trust Board and the Sub-Board Committees. To nurture a supportive and learning culture that is based upon six fundamental values, namely; Accessible, Responsive, Quality, Caring, Ethical and Commitment, the Risk Management Strategy Objectives have been identifi ed: Training To deliver training Trust-wide so that operational risk management is clearly understood and observed.Robust Governance Procedures To observe robust governance procedures so that there is clear process to identify, escalate, manage and/or mitigate all risks that may potentially impact upon operational service delivery, both clinical and non-clinical.Strategic Risks To enable clear recognition and management of strategic risks so as to ensure the optimum sustainability and quality of delivered care across Trust Services. Organisational Learning To ensure that learning from risks is communicated and integrated so as to inform future service delivery.Culture To make effective contribution to the Trust's culture wherein risks are openly and honestly acknowledged.Robust Governance To enable clear recognition AR 94\" \"The Trust comprises fi ve clinical service Divisions and a number of Corporate Departments, all of which have risk registers which comprise the organisation wide risk register. Risk assessments are pro-actively encouraged as a normal function of day to day activity, as we believe that effective Risk Management is integral to strategic planning and corporate objective setting. All risks are recorded on a Trust-wide electronic system and are rated using a standardised methodology for quantifying risks; this assesses the consequence of the risk and the likelihood of it arising and arrives at an overall risk score. Once identifi ed, risks are further assessed in terms of the controls and assurances that are in place to manage them and actions are developed to manage any gaps identifi ed. Mitigating action can reduce the consequence and likelihood of risk; however, some residual risk may still remain that requires managing. In line with our Risk Management Strategy 2015-18, identifi ed risks are scored using the National Patient Safety Agency matrix and the risk register is regularly monitored at both divisional and corporate level. The level of risk that the Trust is prepared to accept, before action is deemed necessary to reduce it, is defi ned in the Trust 'Risk Appetite Statements'. This represents a balance between the potential benefi ts of innovation and the threats that change inevitably brings. The Board has agreed and maintains the risk appetite of the Trust and reviews this in line with national and organisational change and the Orange Book: Management of Risk - Principles and Concepts (HM Treasury, 2013). The Trust Risk Appetite Statement is; The Organisation recognises that it is impossible to deliver its services and achieve its aims without managing and taking risks. It must, however, take risks in a controlled manner, thus reducing its exposure to a level deemed acceptable, from time to time, by the Board and by extension, external inspectors and relevant legislation. AR 95Objective Description Risk Appetite PeopleTo have a skilled, innovative workforce who are compassionate and caring, where staff are empowered to take action and where customer service and clinical leadership is at the heart of our service.We will actively empower and support our staff to take action and innovate only where they have the adequate skills, knowledge, competence and support.

Strategic Risks The top 6 risks to delivery of the Trust's Strategic Objectives recorded within the Board Assurance Framework in 2017-18 were: 1. Ther e is a risk of the Trust not being the provider of choice for our existing portfolio of core community services due to increased competition from other health providers and potential market testing by commissioners, resulting in loss of contracted income for the Trust. 2. Ther e is a risk that the leadership of the Trust and the delivery of our integrated delivery models may be adversely impacted as a result of the shared Chief Executive Officer (CEO) arrangements between Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (BCHC) and Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (BCP). 3. Ther e is a risk that users of our services will receive care below the standard expected whilst the Trust continues to deliver additional financial efficiency savings over the next 5 years. 4. If we do not have the appr opriate mechanisms to effectively engage with our staff and external stakeholders, the organisation will not be able to promote its core service and we will fail to be seen as a credible potential partner, provider and employer of choice. 5. If we do not have the technological infrastructur e to support location-based services that have limited or no BCHC technology infrastructure, this will result in no access to patient/service records and non-delivery of the Trust's Digital Strategy. 6. If we do not build ef fective partnerships with suitable organisations, there is a risk that we will fail to find partners with alignment to our values and delivery outcomes and that the implementation of partnership arrangements will fail.During 2017-18, the following risks were added in year to the Board Assurance Framework; 1. Ther e is a risk that successful integration will be impacted by the change in leadership of BCHC. 2. Ther e are significant risks associated with a delay to the transaction date of 1st October 2017: Unable to sustain current leadership and management arrangements which may impact on performance and result in ending Executive cover arrangements; Vacancy management in place which if continued post 1/10 would create significant staffing issue, synergies will not be delivered within the timescale specified, inability to deliver management of change process and have teams in place to enable credible operational planning 18-19, staff with uncertain future are unlikely to remain for extended period and will seek alternative employment. Risk to the Constitution of BCP due to number of governors. Uncertainty will affect staff morale. 3. Ther e is a risk that Clinical Divisions and Corporate Support Services will be unable to achieve required transformation and redesign; cultural change; and business objectives because the demands on the same resources to deliver this is concurrent or overlapping and therefore exceeds capacity and focus. This could adversely affect delivery against strategic objectives and clinical priorities. All Trust Board members support a proactive approach to risk management within the organisation. The Board reviews the Risk Register in full on an annual basis at the start of the financial year and subsequently reviews new risks, removed risks and all high level risks on a quarterly basis. The Board also receives an Annual Risk Management Report which provides assurance to the Board that the Risk Management Strategy is being implemented. AR 97The Trust Board has overall responsibility for the management of risk across the organisation. Its specific duties include: setting the risk appetite for the organisation; ensuring an ef fective system of internal control including risk management; r eceiving the Board Assurance Framework quarterly, and advising on mitigations and actions as appropriate; r eceiving assurance reports from all Board Sub-Committees with regard to risks, internal control and assurance. The Board have up to date access to information on the Trust Risk Register through reporting arrangements from the sub committees described below. Information on significant risks, the magnitude of those risks, options for risk prevention or control and progress made in achieving control are agreed and approved at the Quality, Governance and Risk Committee (QGRC). The appropriate Executive Director reviews all high level risks and recommends consideration by Quality, Governance and Risk Committee any that may impact on the Trust's Strategic Objectives. QGRC reviews these risks; recommending to the Board where appropriate, inclusion onto the Board Assurance Framework. The Trust Board is informed through quarterly reporting and monitoring of all risks on the Board Assurance Framework. QGRC reviews performance against key indicators and provides monthly reports to the Board relating to achievements and areas of concern. QGRC is therefore able to escalate risks to the Board in a timely manner. This Committee reviews, approves and scrutinises quality indicators associated with delivery of the Cash Releasing and Efficiency Savings (CRES) programme on behalf of the Board and monitors the impact of the programme on quality and user experience. QGRC provides an annual assurance report to the Audit CommitteeA number of sub-committees report to QGRC; including the Risk Management Committee which has responsibility for Health and Safety, Medical Devices Management and co-ordination of Risk Management activities at Divisional and service level across the Trust. Assurance is obtained from Divisional governance groups that manage and investigate risks and incidents locally. The Clinical Governance Committee also reports to QGRC and undertakes detailed scrutiny of compliance with Care Quality Commission (CQC) standards. An internal programme of inspection is operated and provides assurance of on-going compliance. Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust is fully compliant with the registration requirements of the Care Quality Commission. The provision of primary health care services to the population of HMP Birmingham by Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust was reviewed by the CQC in February 2017 and identified a number of areas for improvement. These have all now been rectified by the Trust and a subsequent review conducted by the CQC in February 2018 identified that primary health care services were being provided safely. AR 98The Trust has a robust and embedded performance management and escalation process operating across all services that enables the Board to be sighted on risks and issues in a timely manner. This process is supported by a strong board committee structure that enables timely provision of data, scrutiny and challenge and escalation and assurance to the Board. The Board of Directors reviews and approves a Corporate Governance Statement on an annual basis, as required by its license conditions, and is assured of its validity through the strong leadership, governance, performance, risk management and escalation processes that it employs and which are described in this Annual Governance Statement. The Board has sound systems of corporate governance and internal controls in place and receives annual assurance of this from the Head of Internal Audit through the Head of Internal Audit Opinion. The Board has due regard to guidance issued in respect of good corporate governance basing its arrangements on the Code of Good Governance and Single Oversight regime which includes the Risk Assessment Framework. The Board has approved a committee structure comprising: Audit Committee Nomination and Remuneration Committee Quality , Governance and Risk Committee Finance and Performance Assurance Committee Investment Committee Charitable Funds Committee and undertook an annual r eview of their performance in Quarter 4, 2017-18. Each committee has a clear Terms of Reference and work programme which has been approved by the Board. The Trust Board is a unitary Board and members are clear about Trust Board accountability. There are clear lines of accountability and reporting through the committee structures. Each of the Committees provides assurance to the Board in relation to the activities defined within its Terms of Reference; this is reported to the next meeting of the Board in the form of an Interim Report to ensure that necessary issues are highlighted in a timely way. The Board has approved and keeps under review Standing Orders, Reservation and Delegation of Powers and Standing Financial Instructions and has approved the levels of delegation of powers via these documents. Every Assurance Framework risk and Annual Plan Deliverable has an accountable manager and Executive Director identified. The Clinical Service Divisions are led by a Clinical Director and Divisional Director who are accountable to the Chief Operating Officer. AR 99The Trust operates a Management Board at which Divisional, Clinical and Corporate Service Directors are accountable. Divisional Management Boards have been embedded with agreed Agendas in order to provide consistency of governance arrangements across the Trust. Divisional Management Board monitors and escalates accordingly at a Divisional Level. Each Division is held to account for performance through a robust confirm and challenge/programmes and performance management process. The Board and its Committees provide scrutiny and approval of financial and performance statements and closely monitor quality performance, triangulating this with patient and staff feedback, complaints and incidents. The Board and its Committees receive information in a timely manner, reporting on verified data relating to the previous month. There are also clear in month escalation processes in place should the need arise to escalate an issue prior to a meeting of the Board or its Committees. The Trust's Standing Orders and Standing Financial Instructions provide deadlines for the provision of reports and papers to the Board and its Committees ensuring timely reporting. Should there be any exceptions, these are reported and reviewed by Audit Committee. The Board operates a robust and engaging process for the development of strategic and operational plans, closely monitoring delivery through committee arrangements and divisional level confirm and challenge events.The Trust Board recognises the importance of ensuring that it is fit for purpose to lead the Trust and an on-going programme of Board Development activity is in place. Appointment to the Executive post of Medical Director was made substantively in year following the retirement of the previous post-holder. Additionally, a Non-Executive Director post was also appointed and approved by the Council of Governors following expiry of the previous post-holders Term of Office. Succession planning and talent management is undertaken by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. In order to maintain the Trust Board's strong focus on quality, meetings of the Quality Governance and Risk Committee are conducted on a monthly basis. The Quality Governance and Risk Committee ensure that all aspects of quality governance are subject to scrutiny in order to provide assurance to the Trust Board. This Committee assumes a scrutiny role in the development of the Quality Account. The Trust Board has received significant assurances of the governance of these arrangements and compliance through the Internal and External Audit Work Programmes. The Trust operates a programme of comprehensive reporting, with timely reporting of prior month data at each Board and Committee meeting. Additionally, a process of Early Warnings in respect to clinical care quality supported by a clear escalation process through Divisional and Clinical Governance Committees to Quality Governance and Risk Committee is embedded throughout the Trust. The Board comprises a broad range of skills and experience within both the Executive and Non-Executive Teams from both public and private sector, and clinical and non-clinical organisations. The Board has two clinical Executive Directors and these are supported by other members of the Board who have clinical backgrounds. AR 100The skills and experience of Board members cover the range of duties and responsibilities that the Board undertakes and provides for appropriate challenge and decision making. The Trust has a strong standing within the Local Health Economy and is perceived as being a proactive leader in shaping the provision of services into the future. The Board reviews and approves a dynamic programme of development that is executed via monthly Board Seminars and occasional Away Days. Clinical Service Divisions are jointly led by a Clinical Director and a Service Director to ensure a balanced approach to quality and safety is maintained. A succession planning process and policy have been discussed and agreed at Nomination and Remuneration Committee. Patients, carers, members, public (and other stakeholders including staff) help to identify risks that may be impacting on them through patient feedback channels and surveys, Friends and Family Test, customer services (PALS) and complaints. The Trust actively engages and consults with communities, community groups, Healthwatch and other representative organisations for major service changes and developments and proactively encourages Members' and Governors' participation and involvement in the work of governance and other committees including Clinical Governance Committee, Patient Experience Forum, Research and Innovation Group. In response to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) review of arrangements to promote working together in the Birmingham area, the Trust has been actively engaged in Birmingham and Solihull Service Transformation Plans; working closely with our partners to refresh plans and support the Health and Social Care system to help communities to 'Live Healthy, Live Happy' and in delivering care closer to home. The Trust Board has completed a self-assessment and received evidence of leadership actions and compliance with NHS Improvement's ten standards relating to statutory data security and protection requirements. The Board approved submission of their declaration of compliance and has also approved an action plan to ensure on-going compliance.The Trust has received full assurance in respect of risk management processes. However, the Trust was provided with a limited assurance report following review undertaken of cyber security arrangements. The cyber security audit undertaken gave assurance that the Trust was in the main protected by external protection processes but that vulnerabilities existed. Improvements in controls have been implemented including the implementation of a multi-layered defence strategy and comprehensive action plan. As an employer with staff entitled to membership of the NHS Pension Scheme, control measures are in place to ensure all employer obligations contained within the Scheme regulations are complied with. This includes ensuring that deductions from salary, employer's contributions and payments into the Scheme are in accordance with the Scheme rules, and that member Pension Scheme records are accurately updated in accordance with the time scales detailed in the Regulations. Control measures are in place to ensure that all the organisation's obligations under equality, diversity and human rights legislation are complied with. Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust has undertaken risk assessments and Carbon Reduction Delivery Plans are in place in accordance with emergency preparedness and civil contingency requirements, as based on UKCIP 2009 weather projects, to ensure that this organisation's obligations are completed. AR 10111.6. Information Governance During 2017-18 Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust reported one Level 2 Information Governance incident requiring notification to the Information Commissioner in respect of records taken from a staff member's car in January 2018. The incident is undergoing comprehensive internal investigation and outcomes and improvement actions will be reported appropriately to the Information Governance Steering Group and Quality, Governance and Risk Committee. 11.7. Incident Data During the period 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018 a total of 7450 incidents have been reported. This figure includes 107 Serious Incidents (SIs), of which 14 were subsequently reclassified as not being SIs, leaving an overall total of 93. Of these 93 serious incidents, 55 related to the development of pressure ulcers and 18 to in-patient fractures/severe harm. All new and on-going serious incidents and those where root cause analysis investigations have been completed and lessons learned are reported to the Quality, Governance and Risk Committee at each meeting. Two Never Events were reported at the Birmingham Dental Hospital, which related to 'Wrong Site Surgery', where anaesthesia (block) was incorrectly administered into the wrong side of the mouth. No harm was caused in either incident. The Trust was victim to the national Wannacry incident in May 2017. Whilst the Trust responded well to the incident and minimised disruption to services and their users, the incident showed vulnerability in the Trust's IT arrangements which are being actively addressed. 11.8. Review of Economy, Efficiency and Effectiveness of the Use of Resources The Trust's 2017-18 Financial Plan was approved by the Board of Directors in March 2017. The plan set out the r equirement for a surplus of \u00a34.8m (excluding revaluations), which was dependent upon the delivery of \u00a36.9m in efficiency savings. The plan also included \u00a31.6m from the Sustainability and Transformation Fund (STF) provided by NHS Improvement. Cash Releasing Efficiency Savings (CRES) plans were developed ahead of the financial year through an established gateway process, which includes clinical scrutiny and sign-off of each scheme, and these were embedded in operational budgets from the beginning of the year. The Trust's financial performance (including CRES delivery) is reported to the Trust Board on a monthly basis, and is reviewed in detail at the Finance and Performance Assurance Committee. Thr ough a suite of standard reports all key financial metrics are reviewed, including those in relation to NHSI's Single Oversight Framework, and where variances from plan exist they are scrutinised and challenged appropriately. In addition to the agreed annual CRES plan, further efficiencies are released through the year through on-going procurement work, the Trust's management of its various contracts, and the review of recruitment through the Trust's Vacancy Control Panel. The Trust's Internal Audit Plan is refreshed each year, and in the development of the plan the consideration of economy, efficiency and effective use of resources is applied across all audit areas. Internal audit findings are reviewed by the Audit Committee, and any recommendations resulting from each audit are tracked at each meeting of the committee. The Audit Committee reports to the Trust Board following each meeting. The effectiveness of the Audit Committee, and all other committees, is reviewed on an annual basis. This is discussed elsewhere in this report. AR 10211.9. Annual Quality Report The Directors are required under the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amended) to prepare Quality Accounts for each financial year. NHS Improvement (in exercise of the powers conferred on Monitor) has issued guidance to NHS foundation Trust Boards on the form and content of annual Quality Reports which incorporate the above legal requirements in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual. In accordance with the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amended), Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust has prepared the Quality Report for this financial year and designated the Director of Nursing and Therapies to lead the process which has been overseen by the Quality Report Editorial Group whose membership include two public Governors. In the development of the Quality Report 2017-18, the Director of Nursing and Therapies has ensured appropriate key stakeholder consultation and engagement with the Trust's members, the Council of Governors, Birmingham Healthwatch, Birmingham Health and Social care Overview Scrutiny Committee and our Commissioners. This engagement has provided an opportunity for stakeholder comment and objective review in respect to the content of the Quality Report as well as the quality improvement goals set for the forthcoming year. Effective stakeholder engagement facilitates a balanced view of the quality of care delivered by Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. Consultation with staff has also taken place through Board subcommittee reporting, working group structures and staff forums. External Auditors have reviewed the content of the Quality Report 2017-18 for compliance with the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amended) and the NHS Improvement's published guidance 2017-18. Additionally, External Audit have undertaken a comprehensive review of the Trust's performance against nationally mandated quality indicators and a further quality indicator selected by the Council of Governors in order to assure the accuracy, validity, reliability, timeliness, relevance and completeness of the Quality Report. AR 10311.10. Review of Effectiveness As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control. My review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control is informed by the work of the internal auditors, clinical audit and the executive managers and clinical leads within the NHS Foundation Trust who have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework. I have drawn on the content of the quality report attached to this Annual Report and other performance information available to me. My review is also informed by comments made by the external auditors in their management letter and other reports. I have been advised on the implications of the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the board, the audit committee and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. The Trust Board has regularly reviewed the functioning of its Committees and of Board and committee effectiveness. Changes have been made to further improve our governance arrangements and committee Terms of Reference and planned programmes of work have been reviewed and agreed in year by the Board. The Committee structure comprises: Audit Committee Nomination and Remuneration Committee Quality , Governance and Risk Committee Finance and Performance Assurance Committee Investment Committee Charitable Funds Committee The T rust Board has met in public on ten occasions and each meeting has been both well attended and quorate. The Committees of the Board operate to formal Terms of Reference that the Board has approved, and carry out a range of Board work at a level of detail and scrutiny that is not possible within the confines of a Trust Board meeting. Each of the Committees provides assurance to the Board in relation to the activities defined within its Terms of Reference; this is reported to the next meeting of the Board in the form of an interim report to ensure that necessary issues are highlighted in a timely way. The Board also receives the formal minutes of the meetings of each of the Committees once approved by the Committee as a true record. The work that has been undertaken by the Committees includes: scrutiny and appr oval of the annual financial statements and annual report, including the Trust's Quality Account; r eceiving all reports prepared by the Trust's Internal and External Auditors and tracking of the agreed management actions arising; monitoring the Clinical Audit Pr ogramme, serious incidents and never events and ensuring that risk is effectively and efficiently managed and that lessons are learned and shared; monitoring of compliance with exter nal regulatory standards including the Care Quality Commission and the Information Governance toolkit; monitoring of Cash Release Efficiency Savings (CRES) and the delivery of service development; ensuring the adequacy of the T rust's Strategic Financial Planning; monitoring the implementation of the key strategies that the Boar d has approved; and r elevant policy approval/ratification. AR 104Taking account of national and local context, the strategic direction for the Trust has been reviewed by the Trust Board. Areas key to the delivery of the Trust's business strategy, managed and monitored by the Trust Board and the Committees of the Board included: r eview and maintenance of the Annual Plan and Assurance Framework estate rationalisation and development; continuation of partnership working arrangements with Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation T rust and Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust; delivery against the Inter nal Audit programme; and, income, expenditur e and activity On 1st March 2018 the Trust Board agreed that the planned acquisition of Black Country Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and Dudley and Walsall Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust (the 'Transforming Care Together' partnership) would not proceed. Key factors in this decision included clinical concerns raised, the ability to meet financial requirements, increasing risks as a result of continued delays to completing the transaction and issues of strategic fit. A new Medical Director commenced his appointment on 1 July 2017.The Trust Board recognises the importance of ensuring that it is fit for purpose to lead the Trust and an on-going programme of Board Development activity has taken place during the year through a programme of Board Seminars. This has included the statutory training that it is required during the year. All Trust Board members have also been subject to an appraisal during the year and have objectives in place. The Board also takes the opportunity to review and reflect upon its own performance and effectiveness at a dedicated session at the quarterly Trust Board Away Days. The Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing systems of internal control and effective governance and receives assurances from the Quality Governance and Risk Committee and Finance Performance and Assurance Committees through formal reporting arrangements following each meeting and cross membership of the respective committees. Additionally, assurance is received by regular internal audit reports on delivery of the internal audit programme and monitoring of actions to further strengthen governance arrangements. In order to maintain the Trust Board's strong focus on quality, meetings of the Quality Governance and Risk Committee have continued to be conducted on a monthly basis during the year. The Quality Governance and Risk Committee ensures that all aspects of quality governance are subject to scrutiny in order to provide assurance to the Trust Board to support the signing of the Board Memorandum on Quality Governance. The Trust Board are required under the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amended in 2011 and 2012) to prepare a Quality Account for each financial year. The Quality Governance and Risk Committee assume a scrutiny role in the development of this account prior to submission to the Trust Board for approval. The Finance and Performance Assurance Committee has provided a forum for the Trust Board to seek additional assurance in relation to all aspects of financial and general performance, including performance against nationally set and locally agreed targets, monitoring of the CRES programme, and monitoring of the Service Transformation Programme. AR 105The Trust exercises and discharges its statutory functions through the Board and its sub- committees. The Trust Board has received significant assurances of the governance of these arrangements and compliance through the internal and external audit work programmes. Following planned annual reviews of the Board's sub-committee, the Trust has reviewed arrangements for both Quality Governance and Risk Committee and Finance and Performance Assurance Committee and will be making changes in 2018-19 to strengthen the effectiveness of these committees further. Additionally, early in 2018-19, the Trust has commissioned a 'Well Led' review of leadership and effectiveness. The Head of Internal Audit provides me with an opinion on the overall arrangements for gaining assurance through the Board Assurance Framework and on the controls reviewed as part of Internal Audit's work plan. The Head of Internal Audit Opinion has provided me with a significant level of assurance on the Trust's overall system of internal control. This opinion is based on an assessment of the effectiveness of the Board Assurance Framework and a number of assessments undertaken as part of the Internal Audit Plan. The Board Assurance Framework has been assessed as being of the highest standard, grade 'A', again this year. Executive managers within the organisation who have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the system of internal control provide me with assurance. Additional assurance has been received from the Auditor in relation to our financial ledger and payroll systems which are provided by third parties, and the conclusion reached is one of significant assurance. The Trust initially received moderate assurance following a review of Agency Staffing (non clinical) and subsequently, significant assurance following work completed to address areas for improvement and re-audit. The Trust received limited assurance of its cyber security arrangements following an internal audit review and has undertaken an extensive programme of development and investment in response; including the implementation of a multi-layered defence strategy. A comprehensive action plan has also been implemented with the majority of improvements being delivered in year with the remainder on-going as part of a planned roll out of improvements. The Trust will move to the national Health and Social Care Network, replacing the current wide area network, over the coming months and this will provide significant improvements to the Trust's network security arrangements. The receipt of this limited assurance report has not impacted the Head of Internal Audit Opinion that in overall terms, the Trust's system of internal control is robust. 11.11. Conclusion No significant internal control issues have been identified and the Head of Internal Audit opinion provides significant assurance of the Trust's systems of internal control. Date: 24th May 2018 Richard Kirby, Chief Executive Officer AR 106Section 6 Auditor's Report and Certificate Independent Auditor's Report to the Council of Governors of Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust Opinion We have audited the financial statements of Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust for the year ended 31 March 2018 which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Cash Flows, the Statement of changes in equity and the related notes 1 to 30, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and HM Treasury's Financial Reporting Manual (FReM) to the extent that they are meaningful and appropriate to NHS Foundation Trusts. In our opinion, the financial statements: give a true and fair view of the state of Birmingham Community Healthcar e NHS Foundation Trust's affairs as at 31 March 2018 and of its income and expenditure and cash flows for the year then ended; and have been pr epared in accordance with the Department of Health Group Accounting Manual 2017/18 and the directions under paragraphs 24 and 25 of Schedule 7 of the National Health Service Act 2006. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report below. We are independent of the Foundation Trust in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard and the Comptroller and Auditor General's (C andAG) AGN01, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Use of our report This report is made solely to the Council of Governors of Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust in accordance with paragraph 24(5) of Schedule 7 of the National Health Service Act 2006 and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Council of Governors, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. AR 107Conclusions relating to going concern We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where: the Accountable Ofcer's use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the nancial statements is not appropriate; or the Accountable Ofcer has not disclosed in the nancial statements any identied material uncertainties that may cast signicant doubt about the company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the nancial statements are authorised for issue. Overview of our audit approach Key audit matters Risk of fraud in revenue and expenditure recognition We consider that risk of fraud in revenue and expenditure recognition is focused around year-end manual adjustments to income and/or expenditure aimed at improving the reported nancial position of the Trust. Our audit approach therefore focuses on the transactions posted either side of the 31March 2018 balance sheet date which have the effect of improving reported nancial performance. Property, Plant and Equipment valuation The valuation of PPE is a critical judgement and an area of estimation uncertainty as disclosed in the Trust's accounting policies. Small changes in valuation assumptions or the valuation techniques used can have a material impact on the carrying value of assets. Our approach has con-sidered the work of the Trust's valuers, their competence and capabilities, as well as testing the completeness and appropriateness of information provided to the valuer. Where appropriate we have involved EY valuation experts to challenge the assumptions used by the Trust's valuer. Materiality Overall materiality of \u00a35.3m which represents 2 per cent of gross operating expenditure. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signicance in our audit of the nancial statements of the current period and include the most signicant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identied. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the nancial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. AR 108Risk Our response to the riskKey observations communicated to the Audit Committee Risk of fraud in revenue and expenditure recognition Under ISA 240 there is a presumed risk that revenue may be misstated due to improper revenue recognition. In the public sector, this requirement is modied by Practice Note 10 issued by the Financial Reporting Council, which states that auditors should also consider the risk that material misstatements may occur by the manipulation of expenditure recognition. In addition, as identied in ISA (UK and Ireland) 240, management is in a unique position to perpetrate fraud because of its ability to manipulate accounting records directly or indirectly and prepare fraudulent nancial statements by overriding controls that otherwise appear to be operating effectively. We identify and respond to this fraud risk on every audit engagement. Our judgement is that these risks manifests primarily in judgemental accruals and estimates in year-end balances which have the effect of improving reported nancial performance.This risk has been addressed by the following audit procedures: testing the completeness and valuation of expenditure accruals, to gain assurance that there have been no material amounts of expenditure omitted from the nancial statements; testing the existence and valuation of income accruals to gain assurance that income recognised is valid; testing contract variations and provisions at the year end to gain assurance that there have been no material amounts of income which have been inappropriately recognised in the nancial statements; reviewing the output of the NHS agreement of balances exercise and investigating any differences that are signicant to our audit. We will review any variances 100k or more on the income and expenditure elements; testing expenditure cut-off through our unrecorded liabilities testing to gain assurance that there has been no material amounts of expenditure omitted from the nancial statements and that expenditure has been accounted for in the correct period; testing the existence and valuation of debtors and accrued income, including testing for subsequent receipt (to conrm recoverability of the debtor or accrued income item); completing journal entry testing within specic parameters.Our testing has not identied any material misstatements with respect to revenue and expenditure recognition. Overall our audit work did not identify any material issues or unusual transactions which indicated that there had been any misreporting of the Trust's nancial position. AR 109Risk Our response to the riskKey observations communicated to the Audit Committee Property, Plant and Equipment Valuation With \u00a3120 million held on the balance sheet as at 31 March 2018, Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) contributes to a signicant proportion of the Trust's net worth. The valuation of PPE is a critical judgement and an area of estimation uncertainty as disclosed in the Trust's accounting policies. Small changes in valuation assumptions or the valuation techniques used can have a material impact on the carrying value of assets. The Trust's land and buildings are revalued every 5 years. On an annual basis, interim valuations are undertaken to ensure the valuations remain free from material misstatement. The Trust have engaged an independent valuer, Cushman and Wakeeld, to perform a desktop valuation of the Trust's land and buildings as at 31st March 2018 to supplement the last full valuation which was undertaken by the District Valuation Service as at 1st April 2014. The key matters that we have focused on in performing our procedures, are: inputs provided to the valuer in calculating the valuations appropriateness of indexation applied determination of useful economic lifeThis risk has been addressed by the following audit procedures: evaluating the competence, capabilities and objectivity of the specialist valuer; reviewing the terms of engagement /instructions issued to the valuer to ensure these are consistent with accounting standards; engaging EY valuation specialists to review the assumptions used by Cushman and Wakeeld; performing appropriate tests over the completeness and appropriateness of information provided to the valuer; reviewing the classication of assets and ensure the correct valuation methodology has been applied; and ensuring the valuer's conclusions have been appropriately recorded in the accounts.We are satised that the value of Property, Plant and Equipment as at 31st March 2018 is free from material misstatement. In the prior year, our auditor's report included a key audit matter in relation to the risk of management override of controls. In the current year, we have not reported this matter separately as we consider the risk to be most focused on revenue and expenditure recognition and those transactions which have the effect of improving reported nancial performance. Consideration of management override risk is therefore contained within the key audit matter 'Risk of fraud in revenue and expenditure recognition'. AR 110Risk Our response to the riskKey observations communicated to the Audit Committee Property, Plant and Equipment Valuation With \u00a3120 million held on the balance sheet as at 31 March 2018, Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) contributes to a significant proportion of the Trust's net worth.

An overview of the scope of our audit Tailoring the scope Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for the Foundation Trust. This enables us to form an opinion on the financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Foundation Trust and effectiveness of controls, including controls and changes in the business environment when assessing the level of work to be performed. All audit work was performed directly by the audit engagement team. Materiality The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures. We determined materiality for the Trust to be \u00a35.3 million (2017: \u00a35.3 million), which is 2 per cent (2017: 2 per cent) of gross operating expenditure. We believe that revenue expenditure provides us with a reasonable basis for determining materiality as it is the key driver of the Trust's financial position. During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and decided that no change was required. Performance materiality The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality. On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Trust's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75 per cent (2017: 75 per cent) of our planning materiality, namely \u00a33.9million (2017: \u00a33.9million). We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to our understanding of the overall control environment and the results of our audit in 2016/17. Reporting threshold An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of \u00a30.25million (2017: \u00a30.25million), which is set at 5 per cent of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion. Other information The other information comprises the information included in the annual report and accounts set out on pages 3 to 113, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. AR 111We read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. We have nothing to report in this regard. Opinion on other matters prescribe by the Code of Audit Practice issued by the NAO In our opinion: the information given in the performance r eport and accountability report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and the parts of the Remuneration and Staf f report identified as subject to audit has been properly prepared in accordance with the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual 2017/18. Matters on which we report by exception The Code of Audit Practice requires us to report to you if W e issue a report in the public interest under schedule 10(3) of the National Health Service Act 2006; W e refer the matter to the regulator under schedule 10(6) of the National Health Service Act 2006 because we have reason to believe that the Trust, or a director or officer of the Trust, is about to make, or has made, a decision involving unlawful expenditure, or is about to take, or has taken, unlawful action likely to cause a loss or deficiency; W e are not satisfied that the Trust has put in place proper arrangements to secure economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources as required by schedule 10(1)(d) of the National Health Service Act 2006; we have been unable to satisfy ourselves that the Annual Gover nance Statement, and other information published with the financial statements meets the disclosure requirements set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual 2017/18 and is not misleading or inconsistent with other information forthcoming from the audit; or we have been unable to satisfy ourselves that pr oper practices have been observed in the compilation of the financial statements. We have nothing to report in respect of these matters. The NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual 2017/18 requires us to report to you if in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is: materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or appar ently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the NHS Foundation Trust acquired in the course of performing our audit otherwise misleading. W e have nothing to report in respect of these matters. AR 112Responsibilities of Accounting Officer As explained more fully in the Accountable Officer's responsibilities statement set out on page 91, the Accountable Officer is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Accountable Officer determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Accountable Officer is responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Council of Governors intend to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. Auditor's responsibilities with respect to value for money arrangements We are required to consider whether the Foundation Trust has put in place 'proper arrangements' to secure economy, efficiency and effectiveness on its use of resources. This is based on the overall criterion that \"in all significant respects, the audited body had proper arrangements to ensure it took properly informed decisions and deployed resources to achieve planned and sustainable outcomes for taxpayers and local people\".

Foreword to the Accounts These accounts for the fi nancial year ending 31st March 2018 have been prepared by Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust in line with Department of Health Guidance and the 'Manual for Accounts 2017-18' and in accordance with paragraphs 24 and 25 of Schedule 7 to the NHS Act 2006 and are presented to Parliament pursuant to Schedule 7, paragraph 25 (4) (a) of the National Health Service Act 2006. 2. Statement of Directors' Responsibilities in Respect of the Accounts The directors are required under the National Health Service Act 2006 to prepare accounts for each fi nancial year. The Secretary of State, with the approval of the Treasury, directs that these accounts give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the trust and of the income and expenditure, recognised gains and losses and cash fl ows for the year. In preparing those accounts, directors are required to: apply on a consistent basis accounting policies laid down by the Secretary of State with the approval of the Treasury; make judgements and estimates which are reasonable and prudent; state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the accounts. The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the fi nancial position of the trust and to enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with requirements outlined in the above mentioned direction of the Secretary of State. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the trust and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The directors confi rm to the best of their knowledge and belief they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the accounts.

The Trust agreed a control total with NHS Improvement for 2017-18, which is calculated on a different basis from the reported surplus. The Trust agreed a control total of a \u00a34.710m surplus for 2017-18 and achieved a \u00a34.834m surplus against this target. 4. Efficiency Savings In 2017-18 we were also required to identify and achieve Cash Releasing Efficiency Savings (CRES) in excess of \u00a36.9 million, and delivered \u00a36.6m against this target. 5. Where our Money Comes From The majority of our income comes from the provision of patient care which totals \u00a3248.6m. The remainder of \u00a328.7m comes from other activities such as Education, Training and Research. 6. How we Spend our Money In the financial year 2017-18 we spent \u00a3266.2m. The largest proportion of this expenditure was on the salaries and wages that we pay our staff, which totalled \u00a3181.9m. Further details on our expenditure can be found in the Income and Expenditure section of the Financial Statements section of this report. 7. Capital Investment In 2017-18 we invested \u00a36.4m on purchases through the capital programme. \u00a35.6m of this was funded from our own cash resources, and was in respect of: the impr ovement and maintenance of our buildings (\u00a34.0m) investment in IT har dware and software (\u00a31.0m) the r eplacement of clinical equipment (\u00a30.6m). In addition to this, we received \u00a30.8m of cash from the Department of Health, which was also invested in IT hardware and software, including patient WiFi and cyber security. 8.

Information on reserves Public dividend capital (PDC) is a type of public sector equity finance based on the excess of assets over liabilities at the time of establishment of the predecessor NHS trust. Additional PDC may also be issued to NHS foundation trusts by the Department of Health. A charge, reflecting the cost of capital utilised by the NHS foundation trust, is payable to the Department of Health as the public dividend capital dividend.Public dividend capital Increases in asset values arising from revaluations are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse impairments previously recognised in operating expenses, in which case they are recognised in operating income. Subsequent downward movements in asset valuations are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that a previous gain was recognised unless the downward movement represents a clear consumption of economic benefit or a reduction in service potential.Revaluation reserve The balance of this reserve is the accumulated surpluses and deficits of the Trust.Income and expenditure reserve AR 1476.

Accounting policies and other information Note 1.1 Basis of preparation NHS Improvement, in exercising the statutory functions conferred on Monitor, has directed that the financial statements of the trust shall meet the accounting requirements of the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual (GAM), which shall be agreed with HM Treasury. Consequently, the following financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the GAM 2017-18 issued by the Department of Health and Social Care. The accounting policies contained in the GAM follow International Financial Reporting Standards to the extent that they are meaningful and appropriate to the NHS, as determined by HM Treasury, which is advised by the Financial Reporting Advisory Board. Where the GAM permits a choice of accounting policy, the accounting policy that is judged to be most appropriate to the particular circumstances of the trust for the purpose of giving a true and fair view has been selected. The particular policies adopted are described below. These have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to accounts Note 1.1.1 Accounting convention These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to account for the revaluation of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories and certain financial assets and financial liabilities. Note 1.1.2 Going concern Based on the performance detailed in these financial statements and the financial plan for 2018-19, the trust's forecast cash balances will be sufficient for it to continue meeting its working capital requirements for the immediate future. The management of the trust has not, nor does it intend to, apply to the Secretary of State for the dissolution of the trust. Therefore, after making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the NHS foundation trust has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts and these accounts are prepared on that basis. Note 1.2 Critical judgements in applying accounting policies and sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the trust's accounting policies, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from those estimates and the estimates and underlying assumptions are continually reviewed. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revisions affects both current and future periods. AR 149The critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are details below: Modern equivalent asset valuation of property - key source of estimation uncertainty As detailed in note 15, the trust's independent valuer has provided the trust with a valuation of land and building assets (estimated at fair value and remaining useful life). The significant estimation being the specialised buildings, most notably the trust's new LIFT-funded dental hospital, which are valued at depreciated replacement value using a modern equivalent asset methodology. Future revaluations of the trust's property may result in further material changes to the carrying values of non-current assets. 1.2.1. Useful economic lives of property - key source of estimation uncertainty The trust's buildings and equipment are depreciated over their remaining useful economic lives as described in accounting policy 1.6. Management assesses the useful economic life of an asset when it is brought in to use and periodically reviews these for reasonableness. Lives are based on physical lives of each class are based on similar assets as advised by an independent expert. 1.2.2. Provisions - key source of estimation uncertainty Provisions have been made for probable legal and constructive obligations of uncertain timing or amount as at the reporting date. These are based on estimates using relevant and reliable information as is available at the time the financial statements are prepared. These provisions are estimates of the actual costs of future cash flows and are dependent on future events. Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period when such determination is made.Note 1.3 Income Income in respect of services provided is recognised when, and to the extent that, performance occurs and is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable. The main source of income for the trust is contracts with commissioners in respect of health care services. As in previous years, the trust's contract with its commissioners requires income relating to the Birmingham Wheelchair Service to be recognised upon acceptance of referral. Where income is received for a specific activity which is to be delivered in a subsequent financial year, that income is deferred. Income from the sale of non-current assets is recognised only when all material conditions of sale have been met, and is measured as the sums due under the sale contract. Note 1.4 Expenditure on employee benefits 1.4.1. Short-term employee benefits Salaries, wages and employment-related payments such as social security costs and the apprenticeship levy are recognised in the period in which the service is received from employees. The cost of annual leave entitlement earned but not taken by employees at the end of the period is recognised in the financial statements to the extent that employees are permitted to carry-forward leave into the following period. 1.4.2. Pension costs NHS Pension Scheme Past and present employees are covered by the provisions of the NHS Pension Scheme. The scheme is an unfunded, defined benefit scheme that covers NHS employers, general practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of Secretary of State, in England AR 150and Wales. The scheme is not designed in a way that would enable employers to identify their share of the underlying scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, the scheme is accounted for as though it is a defined contribution scheme. Employer's pension cost contributions are charged to operating expenses as and when they become due. Additional pension liabilities arising from early retirements are not funded by the scheme except where the retirement is due to ill-health. The full amount of the liability for the additional costs is charged to the operating expenses at the time the trust commits itself to the retirement, regardless of the method of payment. Note 1.5 Expenditure on other goods and services Expenditure on goods and services is recognised when, and to the extent that they have been received, and is measured at the fair value of those goods and services. Expenditure is recognised in operating expenses except where it results in the creation of a non-current asset, such as property, plant and equipment. Note 1.6 Property, plant and equipment Note 1.6.1 Recognition Property, plant and equipment is capitalised where: it is held for use in delivering services or for administrative purposes; it is pr obable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the trust; it is expected to be used for mor e than one financial year; the cost of the item can be measur ed reliably; and the item has cost of at least \u00a35,000. Items forming part of the initial equipping and setting-up cost of a new building, war d or unit are capitalised irrespective of their individual or collective cost.In addition, assets may be capitalised if, collectively, a number of assets have a cost of at least \u00a35,000 and individually have a cost of more than \u00a3250, as long as the assets are functionally interdependent, have broadly similar purchase dates, are expected to have simultaneous disposal dates, and are under single managerial control. Where a large asset, for example a building, includes a number of components with significantly different asset lives, eg, plant and equipment, then these components are treated as separate assets and depreciated over their own useful economic lives. Note 1.6.2 Measurement Valuation All property, plant and equipment assets are measured initially at cost, representing the costs directly attributable to acquiring or constructing the asset and bringing it to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. All assets are measured subsequently at valuation. Land and buildings used for the trust's services or for administrative purposes are stated in the statement of financial position at their revalued amounts, being the fair value at the date of revaluation less any impairment. Revaluations are performed with sufficient regularity to ensure that carrying amounts are not materially different from those that would be determined at the end of the reporting period. Fair values are determined as follows: Land and non-specialised buildings: Market value for existing use Specialised buildings: Depr eciated replacement cost. HM Treasury has adopted a standard approach to depreciated replacement cost valuations based on modern equivalent assets and, where it would meet the location requirements of the service being provided, an alternative site can be valued. AR 151An item of property, plant and equipment which is surplus with no plan to bring it back into use is valued at fair value under IFRS 13, if it does not meet the requirements of IAS 40 of IFRS 5. Properties in the course of construction for service or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees but not borrowing costs, which are recognised as expenses immediately, as allowed by IAS 23 for assets held at fair value. Assets are revalued and depreciation commences when they are brought in to use. Fixtures and equipment are carried at depreciated historic cost as this is not considered to be materially different from fair value. Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure relating to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that additional future economic benefits or service potential deriving from the cost incurred to replace a component of such item will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be determined reliably. Where a component of an asset is replaced, the cost of the replacement is capitalised if it meets the criteria for recognition above. The carrying amount of the part replaced is de-recognised. Other expenditure that does not generate additional future economic benefits or service potential, such as repairs and maintenance, is charged to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which it is incurred. Depreciation Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their remaining useful economic lives in a manner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. Freehold land is considered to have an infinite life and is not depreciated. Property, plant and equipment which has been reclassified as 'held for sale' ceases to be depreciated upon the reclassification. Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until the asset is brought into use or reverts to the trust, respectively.Revaluation gains and losses Revaluation gains are recognised in the revaluation reserve, except where, and to the extent that, they reverse a revaluation decrease that has previously been recognised in operating expenses, in which case they are recognised in operating income. Revaluation losses are charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is an available balance for the asset concerned, and thereafter are charged to operating expenses. Gains and losses recognised in the revaluation reserve are reported in the statement of comprehensive income as an item of 'other comprehensive income'. Impairments In accordance with the GAM, impairments that arise from a clear consumption of economic benefits or of service potential in the asset are charged to operating expenses. A compensating transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve of an amount equal to the lower of (i) the impairment charged to operating expenses; and (ii) the balance in the revaluation reserve attributable to that asset before the impairment. An impairment that arises from a clear consumption of economic benefit or of service potential is reversed when, and to the extent that, the circumstances that gave rise to the loss is reversed. Reversals are recognised in operating expenditure to the extent that the asset is restored to the carrying amount it would have had if the impairment had never been recognised. Any remaining reversal is recognised in the revaluation reserve. Where, at the time of the original impairment, a transfer was made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve, an amount is transferred back to the revaluation reserve when the impairment reversal is recognised. Other impairments are treated as revaluation losses. Reversals of 'other impairments' are treated as revaluation gains. AR 152Note 1.6.3 Derecognition Assets intended for disposal are reclassified as 'held for sale' once all of the following criteria are met: the asset is available for immediate sale in its pr esent condition subject only to terms which are usual and customary for such sales; the sale must be highly pr obable ie: - management are committed to a plan to sell the asset - an active programme has begun to find a buyer and complete the sale - the asset is being actively marketed at a reasonable price - the sale is expected to be completed within 12 months of the date of classification as 'held for sale' - the actions needed to complete the plan indicate it is unlikely that the plan will be dropped or significant changes made to it. Following reclassification, the assets are measured at the lower of their existing carrying amount and their 'fair value less costs to sell'. Depreciation ceases to be charged. Assets are de-recognised when all material sale contract conditions have been met. Property, plant and equipment which is to be scrapped or demolished does not qualify for recognition as 'held for sale' and instead is retained as an operational asset and the asset's economic life is adjusted. The asset is de-recognised when scrapping or demolition occurs. Note 1.6.4 Donated and grant funded assets Donated and grant funded property, plant and equipment assets are capitalised at their fair value on receipt. The donation/grant is credited to income at the same time, unless the donor has imposed a condition that the future economic benefits embodied in the grant are to be consumed in a manner specified by the donor, in which case, the donation/grant is deferred within liabilities and is carried forward to future financial years to the extent that the condition has not yet been met.The donated and grant funded assets are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other items of property, plant and equipment. Note 1.6.5 Private Finance Initiative (PFI) and Local Improvement Finance Trust (LIFT) transactions PFI and LIFT transactions which meet the IFRIC 12 definition of a service concession, as interpreted in HM Treasury's FReM, are accounted for as 'on-Statement of Financial Position' by the trust. In accordance with IAS 17, the underlying assets are recognised as property, plant and equipment, together with an equivalent finance lease liability. Subsequently, the assets are accounted for as property, plant and equipment and/or intangible assets as appropriate. HM Treasury has determined that government bodies shall account for infrastructure LIFT schemes where the government body controls the use of the infrastructure and the residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the arrangement as service concession arrangements, following the principles of the requirements of IFRIC 12. The Trust therefore recognises the LIFT asset as an item of property, plant and equipment together with a liability to pay for it. The services received under the contract are recorded as operating expenses. AR 153The annual unitary payment is separated into the following component parts, using appropriate estimation techniques where necessary: Payment for the fair value of services r eceived; Payment for the LIFT asset, including finance costs; and Payment for the r eplacement of components of the asset during the contract 'lifecycle replacement'. Services received The fair value of services received in the year is recorded under the relevant expenditure headings within 'operating expenses'. LIFT asset The LIFT assets are recognised as property, plant and equipment, when they come into use. The assets are measured initially at fair value in accordance with the principles of IAS 17. Subsequently, the assets are measured at fair value, which is kept up to date in accordance with the Trust's approach for each relevant class of asset in accordance with the principles of IAS 16. LIFT liability A LIFT liability is recognised at the same time as the LIFT assets are recognised. It is measured initially at the same amount as the fair value of the LIFT assets and is subsequently measured as a finance lease liability in accordance with IAS 17. An annual finance cost is calculated by applying the implicit interest rate in the lease to the opening lease liability for the period, and is charged to 'finance costs' within the statement of comprehensive income. The element of the annual unitary payment that is allocated as a finance lease rental is applied to meet the annual finance cost and to repay the lease liability over the contract term. An element of the annual unitary payment increase due to cumulative indexation is allocated to the finance lease. In accordance with IAS 17, this amount is not included in the minimum lease payments, but is instead treated as contingent rent and is expensed as incurred. In substance, this amount is a finance cost in respect of the liability and the expense is presented as a contingent finance cost in the statement of comprehensive income. Lifecycle replacement Components of the asset replaced by the operator during the contract ('lifecycle replacement') are capitalised where they meet the Trust's criteria for capital expenditure. They are capitalised at the time they are provided by the operator and are measured initially at their fair value. The element of the annual unitary payment allocated to lifecycle replacement is pre-determined for each year of the contract from the operator's planned programme of lifecycle replacement. Where the lifecycle component is provided earlier or later than expected, a short-term finance lease liability or prepayment is recognised respectively. Where the fair value of the lifecycle component is less than the amount determined in the contract, the difference is recognised as an expense when the replacement is provided. If the fair value is greater than the amount determined in the contract, the difference is treated as a 'free' asset and a deferred income balance is recognised. The deferred income is released to the operating income over the shorter of the remaining contract period or the useful economic life of the replacement component. Assets contributed by the NHS trust to the operator for use in the scheme Assets contributed for use in the scheme continue to be recognised as items of property, plant and equipment in the NHS trust's statement of financial position. A LIFT liability is recognised at the same time as the LIFT assets are recognised. It is measured at the present value of the minimum lease payments, discounted using the implicit interest rate. It is subsequently measured as a finance lease liability in accordance with IAS 17. AR 154As part of an overall scheme to re-provide dental health services for the population of Birmingham, the Trust entered into a contract with BaS LIFT (a Public Private Partnership) for the design, build, nancing and operation of a new Dental Hospital. The Trust has entered into a 25 year contract with BaS Lift. The Trust has certain options in respect of the continued provision of the facility and services, these will be considered in the light of prevailing circumstances at that time. Note 1.6.6 Useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment Useful economic lives reflect the total life of an asset and not the remaining life of an asset. The range of useful economic lives are shown in the table below: Min life Max life Years Years Land Innite Innite Buildings, excluding dwellings 2 82 Plant and machinery 5 15 Transport equipment 7 7 Information technology 5 5 Furniture and ttings 10 10 Finance-leased assets (including land) are depreciated over the shorter of the useful economic life or the lease term, unless the trust expects to acquire the asset at the end of the lease term in which case the assets are depreciated in the same manner as owned assets above. Capital expenditure on properties that are leased, rather than owned, by the trust, as depreciated over the remaining lease term. Note 1.7 Intangible assets 7 Note 1.7.1 Recognition Intangible assets are non-monetary assets without physical substance which are capable of being sold separately from the rest of the trust's business or which arise from contractual or other legal rights. They are recognised only where it is probable that future economic benets will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the trust and where the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. AR 155Internally generated intangible assets Expenditure on research is not capitalised, and expenditure on development is capitalised only where all of the following can be demonstrated: the pr oject is technically feasible to the point of completion and will result in an intangible asset for sale or use the trust intends to complete the asset and sell or use it the trust has the ability to sell or use the asset how the intangible asset will generate pr obable future economic or service delivery benefits, eg, the presence of a market for it or its output, or where it is to be used for internal use, the usefulness of the asset; adequate financial, technical and other r esources are available to the trust to complete the development and sell or use the asset the trust can measur e reliably the expenses attributable to the asset during development. Software Software which is integral to the operation of hardware, eg an operating system, is capitalised as part of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment. Software which is not integral to the operation of hardware, eg application software, is capitalised as an intangible asset. Note 1.7.2 Measurement Intangible assets are recognised initially at cost, comprising all directly attributable costs needed to create, produce and prepare the asset to the point that it is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Subsequently intangible assets are measured at current value in existing use. Where no active market exists, intangible assets are valued at the lower of depreciated replacement cost and the value in use where the asset is income generating. Revaluations gains and losses and impairments are treated in the same manner as for property, plant and equipment. An intangible asset which is surplus with no plan to bring it back into use is valued at fair value under IFRS 13, if it does not meet the requirements of IAS 40 of IFRS 5. Intangible assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or \"fair value less costs to sell\". Amortisation Intangible assets are amortised over their expected useful economic lives in a manner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. Note 1.7.3 Useful economic lives of intangible assets Useful economic lives reflect the total life of an asset and not the remaining life of an asset. Purchased software is amortised over the period of the licence. Note 1.8 Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is measured using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Note 1.9 Cash and cash equivalents Cash is cash in hand and deposits with any financial institution repayable without penalty on notice of not more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are investments that mature in 3 months or less from the date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value. In the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and that form an integral part of the trust's cash management. Cash, bank and overdraft balances are recorded at current values. AR 156Note 1.10 Financial instruments and financial liabilities Recognition Financial assets and financial liabilities which arise from contracts for the purchase or sale of non-financial items (such as goods or services), which are entered into in accordance with the trust's normal purchase, sale or usage requirements, are recognised when, and to the extent which, performance occurs, ie, when receipt or delivery of the goods or services is made. Financial assets or financial liabilities in respect of assets acquired or disposed of through finance leases are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy for leases described below. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the trust becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. De-recognition All financial assets are de-recognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or the trust has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. Classification and measurement The trust's financial assets are categorised as 'loans and receivables', and its financial liabilities are classified as 'other financial liabilities'. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments which are not quoted in an active market, that are included in current assets. The trust's loans and receivables comprise: cash and cash equivalents, NHS receivables, accrued income and other receivables. Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value, net of transactions costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts exactly estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. Interest on loans and receivables is calculated using the effective interest method and credited to the statement of comprehensive income. Other financial liabilities All 'other financial liabilities' are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts exactly estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial liability. They are included in current liabilities except for amounts payable more than 12 months after the statement of financial position date, which are classified as long-term liabilities. Interest on financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest method and charged to finance costs. Interest on financial liabilities taken out to finance property, plant and equipment or intangible assets is not capitalised as part of the cost of those assets. AR 157Determination of fair value For financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value, the carrying amounts are determined from quoted market prices, where possible, otherwise by valuation techniques. Impairment of financial assets At the statement of financial position date, the trust assesses whether any financial assets, other than those held at \"fair value through income and expenditure\" are impaired. Financial assets are impaired and impairment losses are recognised if, and only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events which occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and which has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset. For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of the revised future cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. The loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and the carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of a bad debt provision. The value of the financial asset is written down directly only once the debt is considered to be irrecoverable. Note 1.11 Leases Leases are classified as finance leases when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Where a lease is for land and buildings, the land component is separated from the building component and the classification for each is assessed separately. Note 1.11.1 Finance leases Where substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset are borne by the trust, the asset is recorded as property, plant and equipment and a corresponding liability is recorded. The value at which both are recognised is the lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The asset and liability are recognised at the commencement of the lease. Thereafter the asset is accounted for as an item of property plant and equipment. The annual rental is split between the repayment of the liability and a finance cost so as to achieve a constant rate of finance over the life of the lease. The annual finance cost is charged to finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income. The lease liability, is de-recognised when the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Note 1.11.2 Operating leases Other leases are regarded as operating leases and the rentals are charged to operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease incentives received are added to the lease rentals and charged to operating expenses over the life of the lease. Note 1.12 Provisions The trust recognises a provision where it has a present legal or constructive obligation of uncertain timing or amount; for which it is probable that there will be a future outflow of cash or other resources; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount. The amount recognised in the statement of financial position is the best estimate of the resources required to settle the obligation. Where the effect of the time value of money is significant, the estimated risk-adjusted cash flows are discounted using the discount rates published and mandated by HM Treasury. Clinical negligence costs NHS Resolution operates a risk pooling scheme under which the trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Resolution, which, in return, settles all clinical negligence claims. Although NHS Resolution is administratively responsible for all clinical negligence cases, the legal liability remains with the trust. The total value of clinical negligence provisions carried by NHS Resolution on behalf of the trust is disclosed at note 24.2 but is not recognised in the trust's accounts. AR 158Non-clinical risk pooling The trust participates in the Property Expenses Scheme and the Liabilities to Third Parties Scheme. Both are risk pooling schemes under which the trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Resolution and in return receives assistance with the costs of claims arising. The annual membership contributions, and any \"excesses\" payable in respect of particular claims are charged to operating expenses when the liability arises. Note 1.13 Contingencies Contingent assets (that is, assets arising from past events whose existence will only be confirmed by one or more future events not wholly within the entity's control) are not recognised as assets, but are disclosed in note 25 where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognised, but are disclosed in note 25, unless the probability of a transfer of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are defined as: possible obligations arising fr om past events whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the entity's control; or pr esent obligations arising from past events but for which it is not probable that a transfer of economic benefits will arise or for which the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Note 1.14 Public dividend capital Public dividend capital (PDC) is a type of public sector equity finance based on the excess of assets over liabilities at the time of establishment of the predecessor NHS organisation. HM Treasury has determined that PDC is not a financial instrument within the meaning of IAS 32. At any time, the Secretary of State can issue new PDC to, and require repayments of PDC from, the trust. PDC is recorded at the value received.A charge, reflecting the cost of capital utilised by the trust, is payable as public dividend capital dividend. The charge is calculated at the rate set by HM Treasury (currently 3.5 per cent) on the average relevant net assets of the trust during the financial year. Relevant net assets are calculated as the value of all assets less the value of all liabilities, except for (i) donated assets (including lottery funded assets), (ii) average daily cash balances held with the Government Banking Services (GBS) and National Loans Fund (NLF) deposits, excluding cash balances held in GBS accounts that relate to a short-term working capital facility, and (iii) any PDC dividend balance receivable or payable. In accordance with the requirements laid down by the Department of Health and Social Care (as the issuer of PDC), the dividend for the year is calculated on the actual average relevant net assets as set out in the \"pre-audit\" version of the annual accounts. The dividend thus calculated is not revised should any adjustment to net assets occur as a result the audit of the annual accounts. Note 1.15 Value added tax Most of the activities of the trust are outside the scope of VAT and, in general, output tax does not apply and input tax on purchases is not recoverable. Irrecoverable VAT is charged to the relevant expenditure category or included in the capitalised purchase cost of fixed assets. Where output tax is charged or input VAT is recoverable, the amounts are stated net of VAT. Note 1.16 Corporation tax As an NHS foundation trust established under section 30 of the National Health Service Act 2006, the trust is exempted from corporation tax under sections 985 and 986 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. AR 159Note 1.17 Third party assets Assets belonging to third parties (such as money held on behalf of patients) are not recognised in the accounts since the trust has no beneficial interest in them. However, they are disclosed in a separate note to the accounts in accordance with the requirements of HM Treasury's FReM. Note 1.18 Losses and special payments Losses and special payments are items that Parliament would not have contemplated when it agreed funds for the health service or passed legislation. By their nature they are items that ideally should not arise. They are therefore subject to special control procedures compared with the generality of payments. They are divided into different categories, which govern the way that individual cases are handled. Losses and special payments are charged to the relevant functional headings in expenditure on an accruals basis, including losses which would have been made good through insurance cover had the trust not been bearing their own risks (with insurance premiums then being included as normal revenue expenditure). However the losses and special payments note is compiled directly from the losses and compensations register which reports on an accrual basis with the exception of provisions for future losses.Note 1.19 Early adoption of standards, amendments and interpretations No new accounting standards or revisions to existing standards have been early adopted in 2017-18. Note 1.20 Standards, amendments and interpretations in issue but not yet effective or adopted The DH GAM does not require the following Standards and Interpretations to be applied in 2017-18. These standards are still subject to HM Treasury FReM adoption, with IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 being for implementation in 2018-19, and the government implementation date for IFRS 16 still subject to HM Treasury consideration. IFRS 9: Financial instruments The trust does not hold any available for sale financial instruments, and does not undertake any hedging transactions, therefore this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the trust in 2018-19. IFRS 15: Revenue from contracts with customers The trust's income is largely received from commissioners via block contracts and these contract contain a number of performance obligations relating to the provision of services or delivery of activity. These service requirements and activity levels are agreed on an annual basis, with no carry-over to future years, therefore this standard is not expected to have a material impact in 2018-19. The trust does, however, have a contract with local CCGs for the provision of wheelchair services, under which income is currently recognised at the point of referral. The adoption of this standard in 2018-19 will delay the recognition of some of this income to the point at which the wheelchair is delivered, for example. The total value of this contract is c.\u00a33.5m per year, however the trust currently accrues for the cost associated AR 160with these patients, which would no longer be required under IFRS 15, therefore the impact on the trust's bottom line is not expected to be signicant. IFRS 16: Leases IFRS 16 will remove the distinction between operating and nance leases, resulting in a material increase in both the assets and liabilities of the trust, as leases currently classied as operating leases move on to the balance sheet. The value of the outstanding commitments under operating leases is shown in note 9, although the standard provides a potential exemption for leases less than 12 months in duration, which currently includes our lease car and NHS Property Services leases. Note 2 Operating Segments Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust provides a range of hospital, community-based, and specialist services to residents of Birmingham and the wider West Midlands. The trust operates a divisional structure, with ve clinical divisions sitting alongside a corporate division, which includes estates. Expenditure incurred by each division is reported to the trust board, as the chief operating decision maker, on a monthly basis. The year-end position reported to the board is shown below. Income from service-level agreements with commissioners, as well as capital charges, impairments and nance income and expenditure, are currently held within the corporate division. Assets and liabilities are not reported by division. Adult CommunityUrgentCareSpecialist DentalChildren capital charges, impairments, gains on disposal and net nance costs.

Note 4.1 Income from activities arising from commissioner requested services Under the terms of its provider licence, the trust is required to analyse the level of income from activities that has arisen from commissioner requested and non-commissioner requested services. Commissioner requested services are dened in the provider license and are services that commissioners believe would need to be protected in the event of provider failure.

The estimated additional pension liabilities of these ill-health retirements is \u00a3301k (\u00a3134k in 2016-17). The cost of these ill-health retirements will be borne by the NHS Business Services Authority - Pensions Division. Note 8 Pension costs Past and present employees are covered by the provisions of the two NHS Pension Schemes. Details of the benets payable and rules of the Schemes can be found on the NHS Pensions website at www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pensions. Both are unfunded dened benet schemes that cover NHS employers, GP practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of the Secretary of State in England and Wales. They are not designed to be run in a way that would enable NHS bodies to identify their share of the underlying scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, each scheme is accounted for as if it were a dened contribution scheme: the cost to the NHS body of participating in each scheme is taken as equal to the contributions payable to that scheme for the accounting period. In order that the dened benet obligations recognised in the nancial statements do not differ materially from those that would be determined at the reporting date by a formal actuarial valuation, the FReM requires that \"the period between formal valuations shall be four years, with approximate assessments in intervening years\". An outline of these follows: a) Accounting valuation A valuation of scheme liability is carried out annually by the scheme actuary (currently the Government Actuary's Department) as at the end of the reporting period. This utilises an actuarial assessment for the previous accounting period in conjunction with updated membership and nancial data for the current reporting period, and is accepted as providing suitably robust gures for nancial reporting purposes.

In undertaking this actuarial assessment, the methodology prescribed in IAS 19, relevant FReM interpretations, and the discount rate prescribed by HM Treasury have also been used. The latest assessment of the liabilities of the scheme is contained in the report of the scheme actuary, which forms part of the annual NHS Pension Scheme Accounts. These accounts can be viewed on the NHS Pensions website and are published annually. Copies can also be obtained from The Stationery Ofce. b) Full actuarial (funding) valuation The purpose of this valuation is to assess the level of liability in respect of the benets due under the schemes (taking into account recent demographic experience), and to recommend contribution rates payable by employees and employers. The last published actuarial valuation undertaken for the NHS Pension Scheme was completed for the year ending 31 March 2012. The Scheme Regulations allow for the level of contribution rates to be changed by the Secretary of State for Health, with the consent of HM Treasury, and consideration of the advice of the Scheme Actuary and employee and employer representatives as deemed appropriate.

Between five-yearly valuations, interim valuations are undertaken on an annual basis to ensure the accounts reflect the fair value of land and buildings. A desktop valuation of the trust's land and buildings was undertaken by DTZ Debenham Tie Leung Limited (trading as Cushman and Wakefield), an independent valuer, as at 31 March 2018 to supplement the full valuation undertaken by the District Valuation Service of the Inland Revenue as at 1 April 2014. The valuations were carried out in accordance with the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation - Professional Standards (the \"Red Book\") insofar as these terms are consistent with the agreed requirements of the Department of Health and HM Treasury. The Existing Use Value of the trust's properties has been primarily derived using the depreciated replacement cost (DRC) approach, because the specialised nature of the assets means that there are no market transactions of this type of asset, except as part of a business or entity. The DRC approach assumes that the asset would be replaced with a modern equivalent, not a building of identical design, with the same service potential as the existing asset. The modern equivalent may well be smaller than the existing asset, for example due to technological advances in plant and machinery. The valuation of the trust's 23 year interest in the dental hospital as at 31 March 2018 has been derived using a DRC approach because the specialist nature of the asset means that there are rarely market transactions of dental hospitals, other than as part of a business or operating entity. The value of the reversionary interest on termination has been deducted from this valuation. With respect to the land, the notional rent payable by the trust, based on the value of the freehold interest and calculated in line with the public sector cost of borrowing rate of 3.5 per cent. Over the 23 year period of the trust's interest in the property, the annual rental has been discounted at a rate of 5 per cent to reflect the net present value, which represents the existing use value. To provide a desktop update existing use valuation as at 31 March 2018, the valuer has indexed the 31 March 2017 values using the BCIS \"All in\" Tender Price Index. Additionally, they have adjusted the remaining useful life to reflect the reduced term of the Trust's interest in the property.

The values provided for are based on current legal advice, although there remains uncertainty over the value of the settlement in each case. The redundancy provisions relate to the trust's ongoing programme of service transformation. While all affected staff have been consulted before the 31 March 2018, the exact timing of the potential redundancies remains uncertain. Other provisions include potential claims for dilapidations on the exit of leases (\u00a3825k) and a potential VAT payment due to HMRC (\u00a3675k), for which the timing of the payment is certain. Other provisions also include provisions for pay protection costs based on restructuring during previous years, and back pay costs (\u00a3529k), for which the amount eventually payable depends on the staff in post at the time of the payment.

Because of the continuing service provider relationship that the trust has with commissioners and the way those commissioners are nanced, the trust is not exposed to the degree of nancial risk faced by business entities. Also, nancial instruments play a much more limited role in creating or changing risk than would be typical of listed companies, to which the nancial reporting standards mainly apply. Financial assets and liabilties are generated by day-to-day operational activities, rather than being held to change the risks facing the trust in undertaking its activities.The trust's treasury management operations are carried out by the nance department, within the parameters dened formally within the trust's standing nancial instructions and treasury management policy. The trust's treasury activity is also subject to review by the trust;s internal auditors. There are no signicant changes in either the trust's exposure to risk or its policies and procedures for managing that risk since the previous period. Currency risk:The trust is principally a domestic organisation with transactions, assets and liabilities ordinarily being in the UK and sterling based. The trust has no overseas operations and therefore has low exposure to currency rate fluctuations. Interest rate risk:The trust's borrowings are in the form of a xed-interest LIFT agreement and nance lease, although repayments on the former are indexed in line with RPI. The trust therefore has low exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

The maximum exposures as at 31 March 2018 are receivables from customers, as disclosed in the trade and other receivables note. Liquidity risk:The majority of the trust's operating costs are incurred under contracts with clinical commissioning groups, which are nanced from resources voted annually by Parliament. The trust funded its capital expenditure in 2017-18 from depreciation. The trust is not, therefore, exposed to signicant liquidity risks.

AR 189Part 3 Quality ReportCREWSThe Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection teams use a standard set of Key Lines Of Enquiry that directly relate to the ve key questions. These are called the ' ve domains' and each service inspected in the Trust will be judged against each of these: Is the organisation safe? This means that people are protected from abuse and avoidable harm. Is the organisation effective? This means that people's care and treatment and support achieves good outcomes, promotes a good quality of life and is based on the best available evidence Is the organisation caring? This means that the service involves and treats people with compassion, kindness, dignity and respect. Is the organisation responsive? This means that services meet people's needs. Is the organisation well-led? This means that the leadership, management and governance of the organisation assures the delivery of high-quality and person-centred care, supports learning and innovation and promotes an open and fair culture The Quality & Standards Assurance Team has reordered the domains to spell CREWS to help staff remember them. Throughout the remaining sections, we use CREWS to demonstrate how we Caring, Responsive, Effective, Well-led or Safe. For example, the acronym below highlights Responsiveness and Well-led domain: QR 1Section 1 - Quality overview QR 3 Section 2 - Our quality priorities and statements of assuranceQR 23 Section 3 - Review of quality performance QR 63 Section 4 - Achievement stories QR 91 Section 5 - Appendices QR 109Content QR 2Statement of quality from the Chief Executive QR 4 About our services QR 5 Putting Quality rst QR 8 Highlights of the year QR 11 Looking Forward...

I am very proud of the achievements of my colleagues in providing high quality, safe and effective care to hundreds of thousands of patients. This will include the use of \"Ward Huddles\" to improve the safety of vulnerable patients, the opening of a renovated Learning Disability clinic at the Jaffray Centre and the introduction of the Step Right Buddy to aid patients using a walking frame. We also know however that we have more work to do to deliver our ambition to provide outstanding, integrated care. In particular we have had two Never Events at the Dental Hospital and the number of falls resulting in harm continues to occur at a level which causes concern. We have learnt from these incidents and as with pressure ulcers previously will work to reduce the numbers of such incidents in future. Colleagues within the Trust are a vital element to the delivery of our services. It is especially important that we listen to their voice and understand what should change to bring about improvement. We are pleased that more staff than ever responded to the Staff Survey; 73% recommend us for treatment which is equal to the average of other trusts. 59% recommend us as place to work which is a positive increase of 4% on last year. The survey also suggested that we should improve our approach to diversity and equality. In response and considering the Race Equality Standards (RES) and Workplace Disability Equality Standards (WDES) we are undertaking an external equality review to ensure we continue to improve. As a Trust we have engaged with 'Learning from Deaths' and undertake reviews of deaths occurring on our inpatient units to determine whether things could have been done differently. We are investigating deaths occurring in community services and are also actively involved in the Learning Disabilities Mortality Review programme (LeDeR) which looks at deaths occurring in patients with Learning Disabilities. This isn't because we feel that a problem exists, but because we want to ensure that care at end of life is as good as possible and that our care and the experience of the dying patient and their family is as good as possible. Our Quality Priorities have evolved and progressed over the last four years and will continue to do so. Continued sustainable improvement is what we are trying to achieve, building on the excellent foundations which exist. This year we have ensured that feedback from clinicians has been incorporated into those priorities and we will ensure that clinical engagement and leadership continues to prioritise our quality agenda. The priorities chosen aim to improve the recording and sharing of patient information to make the services as safe and effective as possible, delivered by competent and dedicated staff, giving patients a positive experience while in our care. This report is available on the Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust website: www.bhamcommunity.nhs.uk . An 'easy read' version of this Quality Report has been made available through the same website. It is our intention that this document is as informative as possible, and we welcome receiving your feedback, which will assist us in improving the content and format of future Quality Reports. On behalf of the Trust Board, I can conrm that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, the information contained in the Quality Report is accurate and represents our performance in 2017-18 and our commitment to quality improvement.

The Quality Review process encompasses a whole system approach to quality and safety in relation to patient safety, patient experience, clinical environment, and staff safety. QR 7Since joining BCHC in July 2017, I have had the opportunity to critically appraise the Quality and Safety systems operating within the Trust. It is with some pleasure that I can report that the trust is demonstrably in a healthy state regarding these important areas. That isn't to say that there isn't room for improvement- that will always exists. What I have seen is a commitment to patients and enthusiasm for improvement in both service delivery and patient experience which makes me feel very proud to be associated with this organisation. We have a cohort of Patient Safety Ambassadors, who are trained in Quality improvement methodology and who act as local ambassadors for positive change. Our patient experience team work effectively in a calm and polite way gathering feedback, but also addressing concerns as they arise. We could do more to disseminate the ethos of improvement, particularly by linkage through our delivery of Education, Research and Innovation which I believe should underpin our clinical services. I want to fully develop the culture that questions why we do things in a particular way, could we do them better and ultimately what benefi t does it bring to patients? Similarly, I feel that we should be engaging patients and carers more, not simply for feedback but in determining how our services operate and what we deliver. It's 'Our NHS' so let's collaborate effectively to make sure that we get the best from the resources available. BCHC is an organisation which aims to be clinically led and managerially supported. We need to ensure that as well as giving an effective voice to frontline clinicians we also offer development opportunities in management and leadership. In this way we will be able to ensure that there is no divide between our clinicians and managers and that we have clinical leadership extending from the frontline to the board. Effective engagement of clinicians results in signifi cant benefi ts for patient outcomes and must continue to be a priority. As a Trust we recognise that we don't work in isolation. We have been developing collaborative patient pathways with colleagues across health and social care and increasingly this will be a feature of our services. We need to ensure that the necessary governance exists to ensure that outcomes improve and that patients and our colleagues are safe and free from harm. I would like to pay tribute to the hard work carried out by our teams delivering excellent care in all conditions. I am convinced that our services are high quality, safe and effi cient and will continue to develop and improve as we incorporate new ways of working based on evidence, research and improved use of technology to assist decision making. Statement from the Medical Director Andrew DayaniMedical Director I want to fully develop the culture that questions why we do things in a particular way\"I want to fully develop \"I want to fully develop \" particular way\" particular wayPutting Quality first Section 1 QR 8Our quality report demonstrates that we take the safety of our care, the quality of patient experience, and effectiveness of our services very seriously. It also describes the vision for our services which combine compassion, dignity and respect which together provides the cornerstone of our commitment to service users/patients and carers. We remain focussed on our core purpose, which is to ensure our service users/patients and carers have a positive experience of high quality evidence based care, which delivers improved outcomes, the best level of recovery possible and results in an enhanced quality of life. To achieve and sustain this we engage and promote good partnership working and strong effective governance processes. Working in partnership with our service users/patients, carers, staff, governors and key partners is critical to achieving the highest standards of patient safety, patient experience and clinical effectiveness.Providing care, which is safe, of a high quality and effective, is about ensuring our services and people are committed to excellence with the aim to provide as positive an experience for the patient as possible. Improving lives and communities through excellent services and high quality care motivates all of our clinical and support staff alike. We also recognise that our services will only ever be as good as the dedicated and skilled workforce we have and that we invest in. We are immensely proud of our achievements over this last year and are passionate about making improvements going forward, wherever possible. Our quality report therefore highlights our successes and strengths, areas we need to improve upon and our quality plans for 2018 to 2019 and refl ect the organisations commitment to quality and the expectations of high quality care. Statement from Director of Nursing and Therapies Providing care, which is safe, of a high quality and e ective\"Providing care, which is \"Providing care, which is \" and e ective\" and e ective Gareth Howells Director of Nursing and Therapies QR 9Statement from Governors Governors who are representatives of the public are elected by BCHC public members. The Council of Governors comprises 13 Public, 6 Staff and 4 Partner Governors. One of their prime responsibilities is to satisfy themselves that the quality of the care offered by the Trust, as well as the patient experience, is the very best possible. This is partly achieved by holding the non-executive directors to account, ensuring that they routinely carry out checks and follow up issues that are identied. In addition, the Public Governors on the Patient Experience Forum have continued to meet quarterly, reporting back to the Council of Governors,(1) to receive and discuss the Patient Experience Report, taking particular interest in action taken in response to problems identied through patient feedback and other relevant inputs, and (2) to respond to presentations on developments in the Trust affecting service to patients. The members of the Patient Experience Forum have also been given the opportunity to comment on the Quality priorities and the Quality Report, and by annual review have tried to improve their own performance as a group contributing to the quality of the Trust's provision. Governors will engage with staff and patients more directly, continuing on Patient Safety visits alongside Board members, but also by initiating a series of patient experience engagements, reports of which will be shared with the new Patient Experience Group; a sub-committee of the Council of Governors.

We have worked with patients, members of the public, staff and other NHS and local authority partners to make sure that our priorities address their thoughts, concerns and aspirations for community health care. Linking in closely with our strategic priorities, our quality priorities serve as areas of key focus across BCHC. The Board approved our quality priorities for the year ahead, 2018-19, after extensive consultation with a range of stakeholder groups. The priorities are clinically driven and support the three quality domains: Patient Safety, Clinical Effectiveness and Patient Experience.Our priorities for quality improvement How we chose our quality priorities2018-19 The Trust agreed to consult widely on our quality priorities for the coming year 2018-19 with our internal and external stakeholders. The project lead for the Quality Report worked closely with the Trust clinical divisions and corporate leads during the consultation process. The consultation and engagement with stakeholders and our community took place from November 2017 through to the end of March 2018 and allowed feedback to be sent through a number of methods, including an online survey and discussion forums and sessions. The consultation has included: Engagement from the Clinical Divisional through their governance meetings Engagement with the Governors and members Electronic survey accessible through the BCHC website and Trust intranet to encourage the public and staff to share their views with us Trust committees and Boards and with Clinical Commissioning Groups through the Clinical Quality and Review Group meeting. As part of our process for reviewing and proposing the quality priorities for 2018-19, our internal stakeholders reflected on: the consultation feedback our performance against quality indicators our risks on the assurance framework.All feedback from the consultation was reviewed through the appropriate governance forums so we were able to follow up on some of the suggestions that had been made. The Trust Quality Governance and Risk Committee and the Board further discussed and nally agreed the quality priorities for 2018-19 and as we move forward, we seek to further improve the following areas: Patient and Staff Safety 1. Protecting staff from violence, harassment and bullying 2. Patient safety programmeClinical Effectiveness 3. Improving documentation4. Measuring Patient Outcomes Patient Experience 5. Enhancing Patient Experience Supports all three domains 6. Improving staff engagement7. Using Information Technology to improve patient care. The progress of all quality priorities will be monitored and reported through the Trust Clinical Governance Committee, Quality Governance and Risk Committee and the Board Assurance Framework.

The Trust programme of Patient Safety Visits ensures the Board has the opportunity to listen to clinical voice of the organisation and keeps a clear focus on how patient care is delivered. Staff are invited to talk to the visiting team about any aspects of patient safety where best practice exists or where improvements may be identi ed. At the same time, the Board will talk to staff about indirect patient safety issues such as staff experience, information technology systems and processes and the clinical and non-clinical environment. The visits help to keep patient safety at the forefront of the Board's decision making. Patient safety visits are one of the established mechanisms to support communication between managers and staff. During 2017-18 the Board continued to develop and improve the process for programme, with evaluation by the team being introduced as a key measure for whether the visit has been valuable to teams. What is a patient safety visit? Patient safety visits are a facilitated conversation between staff and members of the Trust Board and Governing Council. The conversation includes the visiting team asking questions about how it feels to work in the service, how effective communication is, what they are most proud of and what needs to change to make care and treatment even better for patients. The visits provide the Board with time to listen to staff and talk through their ideas for innovation. All recommendations identi ed during the visit are recorded and developed into an agreed action plan which is subsequently implemented. Feedback received from teams following visits in 2017-18 tells us that the visits have been welcomed and are seen as supportive by staff across the Trust. Section 1 CREWS QR 18Our staff awards programme is open all year round, allowing staff, patients and members of the public to nominate a colleague or team for going above and beyond to provide the very best service or care to patients.

We have achieved or exceeded many of our objectives under these priorities in the last year and have worked to ensure the quality improvement initiatives are embedded in our practice. All quality priorities were monitored through the Trust Clinical Governance Committee, Quality Governance and Risk Committee, and the Trust Board Assurance Framework. The following section of the Quality Report describes in detail how we performed against each of those goals set.Review of our quality priorities Quality Priority 1 - Patient Safety Programme Goals Progress Continue to work with patients, carers and their families to improve harm free care. Deliver Measurement for Improvement at all levels within the Trust and respond, learn and instigate improvement. Promote a positive and transparent safety culture through Patient Safety Ambassadors to deliver quality and safety improvement. Raise patient safety through awareness, education, learning and sharing excellence to support staff to continuously improve their practice. Continue to review mortality and patient deterioration to reduce preventable deaths, avoidable harm and identify and share learning to improve practice and learning for excellence. Achievements: Continue to work with patients, carers and their families to improve harm free care. Greater patient, family and carer engagement is an intervention of the Safety Express programme. Falls prevention, a key priority, has been used to target the work and two falls lms have been produced to be used as educational packages. Listening to a patient's story and their experience following a fall whilst a patient on one of our wards gives more of an insight into the factors to be considered pre and post fall. Met Partially met Not metLooking Back... 2018-19Section 2 QR 24Respond, learn and instigate improvement Workshops have been held throughout the year with staff to learn how to improve their use and understanding of data and information to measure and monitor how safe they are on a day to day basis. A team huddle is an example of where teams have taken this forward. Other examples of progress includes two modules (Patient Safety Ambassadors Campaign) where staff are shown the tools and techniques for measuring improvement as part of building capability for Quality Improvement (QI) Patient Safety Ambassadors Four Cohorts of staff have attended the 5 modules and as a result staff have gained Quality Improvement skills enabling them to learn and improve care everyday using the methodology. Staff have presented their QI projects, corporately and within their divisions, and instigated a spread of changes and improvements in care, across the Trust and within divisions and services. Staff are being encouraged to share and showcase their work locally and nationally. Two QI projects have been shortlisted for awards at the 2018 Patient Safety Congress. Awareness, education, learning and sharing excellence Learning identied from themes from case note reviews, management of incidents, responding to alerts and educational needs identied the need for educational resources to focus on top patient safety issues taken from these sources of information. The Children and Families Electronic Interactive Clinical Handbook, is an example of a patient safety resource developed with service leads. Sepsis awareness sessions for adults and children's services have been well attended and received positive feedback. Their success means that these sessions will need to continue as more staff across all services want to understand the early signs and symptoms of sepsis. Learning from Excellence has also been another positive influence for raising staff awareness of good care and for appreciating it. All of this is shared and spread through journal clubs, staff training days, clinical training days, workshops and events. Mortality and patient deterioration to reduce preventable deaths National Guidance on Learning from Deaths, published in March 2017 required Trusts to adopt a standardised approach to review and learn from deaths. Trigger tool case note review, already in place for inpatients, has enabled the Trust to spread the practice to community and the Learning Disability services to ensure that the Trust is compliant with the national guidance. Improvement work streams enable improvement and learning to be progressed and shared in a coordinated way. Examples of these include; Diabetes management, Sepsis Group, Hydration and Fluid Management, End of Life and Bereavement based on the \"Dying Phase\" of care and the monthly case note review group. From these Quality Improvement projects evolve to address improvements in practice required for mortality and patient deterioration. During the year progress in data analysis and Trust reporting requirements have been met, including the reports to the Trust Board and the public facing report. QR 25Achievements: Children and Families Division Divisional safe staf ng guidance is rati ed and on intranet Health Visitor transformation programme includes monitoring of incidents reported relating to staf ng as quality indicators. Urgent Care Services Bespoke set of clinical training and competency frameworks to further support nursing staff in having the right skills. Competency framework developed for: Band 5 and 6 staff working at the prison Band 6 staff working on CU27 (Good Hope Hospital site) Adult Communities Division Development of Electronic Tool for safe staf ng, including escalation The electronic management system developed to support safe staf ng analysis in district nursing teams is fully implemented. Development of safe staf ng report The Division continue to review the accuracy of the data feed so that it is consistent across the service. The division are using it for local reporting and monitoring. Learning Disabilities Service Clinical training development programme, Band 6 and 7 inpatient competency framework and Band 5 community development program have been developed and are underway.Quality Priority 2 - Safe Staffing Goals Progress The Trust must ensure effective use of systems and rostering tools to provide assurance on safe nurse staf ng levels Section 2 QR 26Achievements: Hear the voice of the child/young person in shaping how services are deliveredPlans for service development and changes have included making sure designs are developed with patients, their carers and the public where appropriate. Examples include the School Ambassador programme and the events organised with and for the ambassadors. One such event attended by ambassadors from 13 schools was held and looked at Emotional Wellbeing. At Edgewood Road (children's respite care service) an event was held for young people to speak about their experiences and expectations of a health respite service. The Early Years Services Partnership invited parents and young people from across the city to help with the branding of the new service. They were invited to a stay and play session in Spring eld Children Centre and were asked for their thoughts and ideas for the new service name and logo. Birmingham Special School Nurses visited ve special schools and spoke to over 60 children and their staff about the service, whether they want their school nurse to wear uniforms and asking them to complete the new card designed to make sure they are easy to understand and t for purpose. The majority of children voted for the nurses to wear a uniform. NHS education and health care career planning event The Education and Development Department held a careers event for 14 to 17-year-olds from local schools in September 2017 and around 400 students came along to speak to us about their career aspirations. Using a graf ti wall, young people shared their thoughts about the future of the NHS and placed their wishes for the future in a wishing well. There was a lot of interest by young people who want to get involved with Trust charitable events and some young people signed up to become members of BCHC. At a different School Nurse Ambassador day the schools redesigned posters for the new school adviser's texting service 'Chat health'. They also made plans for how they would continue to be the ambassadors for their schools and the projects they want to implement locally to ensure they are involved in infl uencing the service they receive. A group of young Umbrella Champions designed new leafl ets for children who have to use the Paediatric Sexual Assault Service and helped us understand where and what information young people in their teens need to access our services and what should be included in the information we provide. The School Nurse Ambassador programme was a nalist for the Patient Experience Network National Awards held on the 1st March at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre.Quality Priority 3 - Patient Experience Goals Progress Hear the voice of the child/young person in shaping how services are delivered Improve engagement and consultation with patients, carers and the public for any changes in how and where services are delivered QR 27Engagement and consultation with patients, carers and the public Examples include: Birmingham Special School Nursing - An interactive lesson plan has been developed and is being taken into school classrooms to show young people new designs for feedback cards and to take feedback on nurses wearing uniform. Four special schools in Birmingham, working with both older and younger groups of children and young people, asking for their advice on the best way of communicating with people with physical and learning needs. Sheldon Unit - As part of the Estates Strategy plans, and following a period of engagement with patients and families, information was produced to support the move of patients from the Sheldon Unit to West Heath Hospital. Moseley Hall Hospital patients were asked to give their thoughts about changes to the District Nurse contract, which had been introduced in July. Patients were also asked to comment upon a new patient leaflet being introduced to support this. Patients were also asked to give their feedback about cleanliness and food provision on a Moseley Hall Hospital ward. Patients and carers were involved in the plans to move patients of Ward 14 West Heath Hospital to Ward 5 Moseley Hall Hospital, and the planned move of Ward 7 from Moseley Hall Hospital to West Heath Hospital. The Early Years Services Partnership; Public information sessions about the new service - 28 public events ran from 11 to 22 September in existing 'early years' settings across the city. The sessions offered: information about the plans for the new service an opportunity for anyone interested to ask questions the chance to discuss local needs with members of the delivery team details about getting involved in services in each areaAt each of the sessions feedback was received on the model, details of people interested in being involved in parent forums in each of the districts gave another opportunity to ask for their ideas for the future. All of this information is being used to continue to build and shape the new way of delivering early years services across Birmingham. District Parent ForumsAs part of the early years' service plans are in place to design a network of parent forums across Birmingham. Each of the 10 districts will have their own forum and over the year representatives from the district forums will meet to share ideas and information in a city wide forum. This will form a strong network of groups and representatives which will in turn ensure there is a structured way of hearing the voice of our children and families on an ongoing basis to help shape service delivery. Dental Services A new User Forum inaugural meeting held on the 18th September.Specialist Services: User Forums held for patients and carers in Birmingham Wheelchair service, Stroke Services and Amputee Rehabilitation Service. The client steering group for Moor Green and Ward 9 are also continuing. The Trust has plans to introduce free patient and public wi in 2018-19 and has drawn up plans based on feedback received for patients and carers over the last 2 years to prioritise key sites.Section 2 QR 28Quality Priority 4 - Measuring Patient outcomes Goals Progress Develop and monitor clinical outcomes to assess and improve the quality of care delivered by our services. Promote and review the current range of outcomes on a structured basis across the Trust Develop the impact of outcomes collated, at a local and wider level Achievements: Develop and monitor clinical outcomes to assess and improve the quality of care delivered by our services. Clinical teams continue to develop and record clinical outcomes, although the majority continue to record their results in paper records which make collation of the results at a service level more dif cult. As more services begin to use an electronic patient record, the Informatics team will be able to extract the data automatically and present it in an already established section of the 1Vision data visualisation platform. This will allow clinicians to review service level data on a regular basis, and where necessary make improvements or change focus. New outcomes identi ed this year include two for paediatric occupational therapy as part of the Traded Services programme, the collation of Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and Functional Assessment Measure (FAM) data for Stroke patients on Ward 8, and the use of a nationally developed patient reported outcome measure (PROM) for dental Oral Surgery. To improve the response rate for the dental outcome the service changed the process mid-year to use a text message to circulate the questions on Smart Survey, and signi cantly increased the number of replies. This process will now be recommended to other services seeking responses from patients weeks or months after treatment. Promote and review the current range of outcomes on a structured basis across the Trust. There is a regular reporting process for clinical outcomes through the committee structure with monthly reports to Clinical Effectiveness Committee and Quality Governance and Risk Committee (QGRC). A number of services presented their outcomes data at Clinical Effectiveness Committee (CEC) including Pulmonary Rehabilitation, Special Care Dental team. Divisions provide feedback on their outcomes to their own governance committees, and then corporately. A Clinical Outcomes Section was again a key part of the annual Clinical Audit and Effectiveness Report which was approved at CGC in December and QGRC in January. Examples of clinical outcomes are also presented at the annual Clinical Effectiveness Day, which this year was at Edgbaston Cricket Ground, and included the use of a FODMAP diet to treat Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Develop the impact of outcomes collated, at a local and wider level The Trust has looked to work with others to improve outcomes, and to share good practice. The Special Care Dental team worked with Healthwatch Dudley to review the impact of their work with adults and adolescents who have a physical, sensory, intellectual, mental, medical, emotional or social impairment or disability or a combination of these factors. A member of the Dietetics team presented her work on treating IBS to the Midland Gastroenterological Society Autumn Conference, and the Head of Paediatric Occupational Therapy (OT) presented her work on Sensory Workshops for parents of children with autism at a workshop during a national OT conference. Paediatric Therapy Services are developing generic outcomes measure for physio, OT and SLT practitioners, based on national guidance, to standardise collection across the services. A draft Clinical Outcomes Framework has been developed to support services who wish to develop outcomes in the future, to support existing delivery, and bids for future activity. QR 29Achievements: Staff engagement scoreBCHC achieved an overall staff engagement score of 3.78 out of 5 which was a marginal improvement on the 2016 overall engagement score of 3.75. The focus in year was on adopting a listening in to action 'You said, together we did approach'. The staff survey data demonstrates that whilst we haven't made a statistically signi cant positive or negative shift we continue to score lower than sector average. The 2018 priority for action will be to work with the Divisions and Support services to increase the percentage reporting effective two way communication between senior management and staff members to achieve 5% increase in the 2018 Staff Survey overall engagement score. Visibility of and methods for staff to contribute towards improvements at work 70% of staff members who completed the 2017 staff survey reported they are able to contribute towards improvements at work. There was a 3% increase from BCHC 2016 staff survey results, however a statistically signi cant improvement is 5% and above. BCHC score is in line with the 2017 national average score for community trusts which is 71%. The 2017-18 Staff Engagement Strategy and implementation plan focused on embedding a range of communication and engagement tools and techniques in order to enable staff members to pro-actively contribute towards generating ideas for improvements at work. We continue to develop our staff engagement approach and are working with Divisions and Support Services to generate a 5% increase in the 2018 staff survey score. For more information on the staff survey see page 52-62.Quality priority 5 - Enhancing Staff Engagement Goals Progress Achieve an improved result in the overall staff engagement score for the 2017 survey Improve visibility of and methods for staff to contribute towards improvements at work Section 2 QR 30Quality priority 6 - Using information technology to improve patient care Goals Progress Improved network connectivity Improved cyber security Improving access to services by telephone and offer alternative means of communication to ensure patients can contact services and be respondedto in a timely manner Uni ed Communications Reduce patient DNA through the use of SMSUpgraded Helpdesk systemNHS Mail 2 Achievements Network connectivity Core networks have been upgraded to increase network speed and resilience New wireless network equipment to support free Patient and Public Wi-Fi has been purchased. The tender for the new wide area network has been scored and a preferred supplier identi ed - this is now going through the Board approvals route Cyber security The Trust received a limited assurance report on cyber security in August 2017 from Internal Audit. As a result of this, and following the May 2017 global cyber-attack, the Trust put a signi cant number of additional measures in place, which are listed below. These actions indicate how the Trust is improving cyber security. Internal audit are due to perform additional procedures in 2018/19 to assess how changes have bene tted the Trust's cyber security. 6 new \"Next Generation\" rewalls are now in place to protect the Trust networks against viruses, suspicious traf c, and malicious software threats The Trust is mid-way through a new anti-virus solution deployment which will improve the security of desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones Installation will commence on additional cyber-security equipment purchased in March. The BDH Booking team will handle around 115,000 answered telephone calls every year spending 6,488 hours talking to patients QR 31 Access to services Migration of Central Booking Service from a simple dial tone and call routing solution to an Industry standard Contact Centre solution with full call management and reporting, including dedicated call queuing and live statistics (among many other features) The Dietetic and Heart Failure/Cardiac Rehab have been migrated to new IP-based telephony (voice over the network rather than older dedicated telephone lines) Redesign and reconguration of the Birmingham Dental Hospitals (BDH) phone system - consisting of a full contact centre solution enhance with the rich functionality of IP Telephony Patients now have a Single Point of Contact to dial for BDH appointments (prior to changes there were 19 patient facing numbers which have now been consolidated into 1) The hospital's DNA rates have dropped signicantly, which are further enhanced by the introduction of an SMS Text appointment reminder. Unied Communications The core telephony platform has been upgraded to the latest supported version which will introduce opportunities for future enhancements. We achieved the enablement of Conference Now which allows Trust staff to use internally hosted audio and video conferencing facilities The Trust is approaching the completion/enablement of Cisco Jabber, which offers secure communication, point to point video conferencing, Instant Messaging, Soft Phones (no need to be restricted to a desk phone), Desktop collaboration and Presence (indicator to show whether a colleague is free, busy, away, in a meeting etc.) Reduce patient DNA through the use of SMS SMS Text integration with RiO Current usage indicates over ve thousand appointment reminders are sent to patients every 48 hours. Services across Adult & Communities and the Dental Hospital have seen a 4.5% reduction in DNAs since the technology was introduced, offering a dramatic improvement in clinic utilisation. Upgraded Helpdesk system The Sunrise Information Technology Service Management was congured in May 17 Over 6000 staff members have been registered on to the solution, with over 4500 incidents are service requests recorded on the platforms.

To implement and imbed clinical supervision as a formal way of refl ection for clinical staff and to up skill and increase the knowledge of nurses in relation to assessment and care planning. To monitor and review clinical education of care planning and assessment within urgent care, following the programme update in 2016-17 Achievements: Care plansThe Divisional Directors of Nursing and Therapies are leading the process across their areas of responsibility. The completion of care plans continues to be monitored monthly by Essential Care indicators (ECI) across all areas. Urgent care/Inpatient Neuro-rehabilitation Unit (INRU) (Ward 9 and ward 8 now part of Adults and Specialist Rehabilitation Division Matrons continue to monitor care planning through ECIs. Training programme continues across staff groups. Admission documentation has steadily improved and was at 95.1% at end of February. Bespoke Care planning training has been delivered throughout the year as per divisional requirements. ECIs now include hydration assessment. Community Integrated Multidisciplinary Teams (IMTs)Themed ECI audit results continue to be used as a helpful benchmark for areas of good practice and improvement. The division met the overall compliance of 90% in the Trust record keeping audit. The clinical record keeping group will commence from the 25th April 2018 and has a focus on the key areas for improvement as identi ed in the clinical record keeping audit, Root cause analysis and Essential Care Indicator (ECI) within the division. Coroner's action plan audit results show an improvement in patient's assessment and care planning and results to be shared at Divisional Quality Governance and Risk Committee. Clinical supervision Clinical supervision sessions are in place for staff to access.Specialist Services - Learning Disability ServiceClinical supervision monitoring systems continue to be developed within the division to ensure review of uptake and appropriate electronic staff record recording. Urgent careAn additional project has been commenced within the division with the Trust Patient Safety Team around improving assessment and care planning. Matrons continue to monitor the effects of the care planning training when undertaking the audits each month and supervision takes place with individual members of staff following the ECI audits where it is identi ed that care planning is not of a high standard. QR 33Clinical education To support urgent care division, there have been bespoke care planning sessions delivered with further sessions available as required, Feedback from bespoke training sessions has been rated as very good and covers the elements identi ed by the division. This has been extended to Learning Disability services who have a Band 5 Development programme which is being monitored by Professional Development team. A review of the programme and evaluation feedback from the band 5 nurses has been positive. A draft development programme for band 6 and 7 nurses working within the bedded areas has been constructed and is currently under review by the divisional nursing leads. Building on the success of the band 5 nurse bedded area development programme, A band 5 clinical development programme has been running for the last few years led by the Practice Teachers for District Nursing. It is for all new staff nurses joining District Nursing teams, it is a week long programme which gives new nurses a grounding and introduction into the core clinical areas of district nursing eg: palliative, continence, tissue viability. Staff are then given a competency book to complete in practice. A review of care planning in Riverside Lodge Short breaks utilising an electronic tool has been developed as a result of the pilot work of the University of Wolverhampton. Section 2 QR 34This section contains statutory statements concerning the quality of services provided by Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. These are common to all NHS trust Quality Reports and can be used to compare us with other organisations. Our Board is ultimately responsible for the delivery and quality of services delivered throughout the organisation. It is therefore also responsible for the accuracy of information that is presented within our Quality Report. During 2017-18 the Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust provided and/or sub-contracted 107 relevant health services. The Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust has reviewed all the data available to them on the quality of care in 107 of these relevant health services. The income generated by the relevant health services reviewed in 2017-18 represents 91% of the total income generated from the provision of relevant health services by the Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust for 2017-18. During 2017-18 six national clinical audits and one national condential enquiry covered NHS services that Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust provides. During that period Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust participated in 100 per cent national clinical audits and 100% national condential enquiries of the national clinical audits and national condential enquiries which it was eligible to participate in. The national clinical audits and national condential enquiries that Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust was eligible to participate in during 2017-18 are as follows: Head and Neck Cancer Audit Learning Disability Mortality Review (LeDeR) National Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Audit Programme (COPD) National Audit of Intermediate Care (NAIC) (RCP) National Diabetes Audit - Adults National Footcare Audit (HSCIC) Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) (RCP) UK Parkinsons Audit (Parkinsons UK)Review of services Participation in Clinical Audit Statements of Assurance from the Board of Directors QR 35Audit Title Participated *% Head and Neck Cancer Audit Host: Saving Faces - The Facial Surgery Research FoundationYes N/A Learning Disability Mortality ReviewHosted by: University of by: NHS Benchmarking NetworkYes See Appendix 1 National Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Audit Programme (COPD)Hosted by: Royal College of PhysiciansYesAscertainment not known (18 cases submitted) National Diabetes Audit - Adults National Footcare AuditHosted by: HSCICYesNo min ascertainment required for this audit Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) Hosted by: Royal College of PhysiciansYes Band AuditHosted by: Parkinsons UKYes100% submitted)The national clinical and national condential enquiries that Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust participated in during 2017-18 are as follows: Head and Neck Cancer Audit Learning Disability Mortality Review (LeDeR) National Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Audit Programme (COPD) National Audit of Intermediate Care (NAIC) (RCP) National Diabetes Audit - Adults National Footcare Audit (HSCIC) Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) (RCP) UK Parkinsons Audit (Parkinsons UK) The national clinical audits and national condential enquiries that Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust participated in, and for which data collection was completed during 2017-18, are listed below alongside the number of cases submitted to each audit or enquiry as a percentage of the number of registered cases required by the terms of that audit or enquiry. *% - Number of cases submitted by Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust expressed as a % of the number of registered cases required by the terms of the audit or enquiry. 1 Ascertainment rate would apply to participating acute Trust, please see corresponding Trust Quality Report for University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust for this information.

Audit National Intermediate Care Audit (NAIC) Action TakenReport reviewed: The NAIC 2017 England Summary Report Report published as planned and highlights presented at Trust Clinical Effectiveness Committee and Urgent Care and Adult Community Services Divisional Management Boards. Development of Divisional Action Plans in progress in response to the ndings. Key highlights/successes from NAIC 2017 Crisis Response shows as low cost per service user assessed Low cost per occupied bed day for intermediate care Key Concerns from NAIC 2017Overall costs per Service User Accepted - especially in geriatric medicine (although this is also associated with higher dependency and higher than average medical cover). Delayed transfers of Care in geriatric medicine Incomplete data regarding patient frailty From a performance and business intelligence perspective the Trust is reviewing data quality concerns to understand benchmarks fully and to ensure better data quality next year. The divisions are reviewing performance based on positives and concerns and will develop an action plan which is due to be presented to the Trustwide Clinical Effectiveness Committee June 2018. AuditUK Parkinsons Audit National Parkinsons Disease Audit 2015 national report Action Taken The service has continued routine weighing of all patients on their initial appointment which was introduced following review of the 2015 UK Parkinsons Audit. During 2017 the service has participated in the re-audit and service level results and national report are awaited. The results will be reviewed and shared with the service and with Clinical Effectiveness Committee by the Parkinsons Disease Nurse who is leading on the audit. QR 37AuditSentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) SSNAP requires all services admitting patients with stroke to complete a minimum data set for all patients. The core data set includes acute care, inpatient rehabilitation, early supported discharge, community follow up and six month reviews. BCHC NHS FT has been submitting data for its inpatient service since January 2014 and receives site specic reports on clinical care of patients with stroke. Early Supported Discharge, Community Stroke Team and Birmingham Neuro- Rehabilitation Team (community follow up provider) are submitting data for SSNAP with the aim of generating frequent reports. Reports reviewed: 4th SSNAP Annual Report for 2016-17 titled \"Rising to the Challenge\" SSNAP 4 years changes over time summary report Site specic SSNAP reports generated by SSNAP for the Trust during 2016-17. Action Taken Project to review access to therapy times is ongoing. Multidisciplinary team meeting covers assessment of continence, mood and cognition. Regular meetings with University Hospital Birmingham (main referring team) to improve quality of data are on-going. Project plan to improve standardised assessment of patient mood. One off audit to evaluate performance in completing mood and cognitive assessments attributed to Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. Key Successes Maintenance of therapy performance over last year. Overall score of B. Achievement of all services participating. Initiation of new practices to improve access to therapy such as therapy supported mealtime assessments Key concernsInfluence of referring Trust on audit scores is outside BCHC control. Section 2 QR 38Audit National Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Audit (COPD) Action TakenThe publication of the national report has been delayed therefore comments below relate to service level data received only. The service has reviewed their results and presented key ndings at Trust-wide Clinical Effectiveness committee in April 2018. Some actions taken focus on the following key areas: BCHC are working in partnership with acute services at Birmingham Heartlands Hospital and Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospital and pulmonary rehabilitation is offered to all patients as part of a Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease discharge care bundle. A home exercise programme to be prescribed on discharge to be completed All patients (meeting inclusion criteria) that are treated for an acute exacerbation in the community setting are offered pulmonary rehabilitation from BCHC clinicians in admission avoidance/ assisted discharge service All referred patients now receive an initial assessment and start date for pulmonary rehabilitation within 28 days. To work with BCHC Communications team to create information packs, a short lm of a pulmonary rehabilitation session on DVD and a list of education resources and patient stories. Audit NCEPOD: Care of Children with Chronic Neurodisability Action Taken The national report was published 8th March 2018 and has been shared with the divisions involved with a request for forward actions taken in response to the report ndings to be shared at Trust-wide Clinical Effectiveness Committee. AuditNational Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide: Annual Report 2017 Action Taken A short life working group to review the policy, assessment, and training will be established July 2018 which will be led by the Associate Director of Clinical Governance. Initial reviews of the training have been positive but it will need to be assessed further before a decision is made as to the next steps. QR 39Title: Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool Audit (MUST) Audit aim: The purpose of the 'MUST' audit was to assess the accuracy of the 'MUST' score calculation and implementation of correct care plan. If nutritional screening is done incorrectly, individual patients who are either already malnourished or at risk of malnutrition can be missed, which in turn can result in harm to that patient. In addition, by auditing the accuracy of the 'MUST' score calculation, staff training requirements may be highlighted, and acted on. Overall identied: Quality of completion of MUST - required further improvement. Frequency of re-screening - While initially performance in re-screening patients on a weekly basis appeared to fall from 2013 - 2015, in recent years there has been a marked improvement in compliance with re-screening on a weekly basis. Implementation of nutritional care plans - Where patient's have been identied as being malnourished or at risk of malnutrition, performance in implementing a nutritional care plan has been consistently good since 2014. Changes to Practice: Since the 'MUST' audit began in 2013, several changes have taken place. In 2014 the 'MUST' tool was re-designed and in September 2017 the 'Nutrition and Hydration Care Plan was launched. This new care plan incorporates 'MUST' and a hydration screening tool, as well as clear prompts for staff to explore whether or not a patient has lost weight prior to admission, so as to implement a care plan in a timely manner. In addition to this, competency based training has been delivered to 218 staff across bedded units on identifying and managing malnutrition, as well as completing the 'MUST' tool. Future Plans:The audit is a helpful tool to monitor trends and improvements in completing 'MUST' and will continue to be carried out on an annual basis. The reports of 166 local clinical audits were reviewed by the provider in 2017-18 and Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust intends to take the following actions to improve the quality of healthcare provided: Local Clinical is a common complication amongst hospital patients with potential to cause signicant morbidity and mortality. VTE is preventable in many cases if appropriate thromboprophylaxis is given Audit aim: The Trust's VTE Policy provides guidance on identication and management of VTE risk for patients. A matron led the audit to assess if VTE guidelines had been adhered to for all patients during their stay in intermediate care, Moseley Hall Hospital (MHH) and West Heath Hospital (WHH). The audit standards focused on identication and management of VTE risk in accordance with Trust policy. Good Practice: VTE risk assessments completed within 24 hours of admission. Weekly review of assessment during ward rounds on Perry trees.Recommendations/actions included: Perry Trees need to share best practice at clinical effectiveness meeting and doctors forum. All qualied nurses to do initial assessment within Urgent Care for consistency. Doctors are to continue to review patients VTE risk assessment on a weekly basis unless the patient's condition changes (as per policy). There also needs to be clear documentation in the patient's medical notes by the medics or Advanced Nurse Practitioner that the assessment has been completed and why the patients are not on prophylaxis. Patient/carer leaflet to be available Please note a number of local clinical audits for the 2017-18 reporting period had data collection which spanned quarter 4 (Jan-March 2018) and quarter 1 of the 2018-19 reporting period (Apr-June 2018). The Trust anticipates the reports associated with these audits will be completed during Quarter 1 2018-19 following data verication and analysis. Examples of further audits completed in 2017-18 are included in the Quality Report and will also be detailed in the Trust's clinical audit annual report (anticipated completion date July 2018).

The number of patients receiving relevant health services provided or subcontracted by BCHC in 2017-18 that were recruited during that period to participate in research approved by a research ethics committee and adopted by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) was over 1000. BCHC continues to identify research opportunities for our patients, carers, service users and staff. Research and Innovation is important to BCHC as it builds research capability, brings BCHC staff together and builds partnership with Universities to improve our understanding of patient conditions and inform how we should improve services for them. During 2017-2018 BCHC opened 41 new studies and received 3 awards from the local Clinical Research Network: West Midlands. BCHC Research Certificates Awarded QR 42Examples of research opportunities 1. The \"BOOST\" study is a lower back pain trial for older people designed by Oxford University. One of our patients has bene ted from their involvement in this study and has shared their experience. It was a BOOST to my con dence, (something we all need at times) letting me see I was capable of doing things that other younger people take for granted. Before I started the programme I couldn't walk upright up a fl ight of stairs...but now I can. For this I must give credit where it is due, and say a great big THANK YOU to Lauren and Joe my encouraging tutors. 2. The Centre of Precision Rehabilitation for Spinal Pain (CPR) Spine Register aims to create a database of individuals 18+ years of age who have neck, mid-spine and low back pain. Registered individuals can participate or help inform new research which will raise public awareness. CRP is part of the University of Birmingham and our services are working in partnership with them. 3. \"Asymptomatic bacteriuria in the elderly (UTI 2)\" explored how we can reduce antibiotic prescribing practices and misdiagnosis of urinary tract infections in older people. The ndings of this research will inform future diagnostic practices.4. The \"Memorable\" study investigates how we can support older people to manage a complex medication regime. This Aston University led research provides opportunities for our staff, patients and carers to share experiences and inform future research in this area. 5. The \"PLAY\" study helps children with disabilities undertake physical activity. The research involved focus groups to explore: i. Children's experiences of using a walking aid, at school, in sports and leisure activities. ii. How physiotherapists choose walking aids and decide how to set them up and when to adjust them. iii. How walking aids can be improved.iv. The views of walking aid users, parents, carers and therapists on what information should be collected and if there would be an objection to the digital collection of information to help increase physical activity levels among children with disabilities. The research ndings will support a larger study and the lead researcher's professional development. QR 436. Collaboration with Birmingham City University BCHC commissioned Birmingham City University to train and support BCHC staff in all aspects of the research cycle including, applying for research funding, designing the study protocol, applying for research governance approval (including ethical approval), recruiting patients, undertaking research risk assessments and interviews and analysing and reporting the research ndings. Examples include:1. Delivering The Walker Study which explores how the use of an elastic band called \"The Step Right Buddy\" (designed by a BCHC Rehabilitation Assistant), attached to walking frames can reduce the risk of falls amongst the frail elderly patients. 2. Supporting a rehabilitation physiotherapist to apply for funding to undertake a study which will determine the predicative capabilities of cough peak expiratory fl ow in decannulation of patients with brain injury in the neuro-rehabilitation setting. 3. Setting up a larger study to enable a group of BCHC staff to assess the impact of the Patient Safety Ambassador's programme on the Trust and our patients.Section 2 Don'ts: Do not place the band on any other part of the frame. The band is provided only for use as described in Steps 1-6. Please do not use for any other purpose other than what it is designed to do. Dos: If the band becomes unattached or if you want the band to be removed, please contact the clinical team as soon as possible.

Examples include: 1. 100,000 Genomes Project: BCHC has successfully recruited patients with rare diseases for this national project. This national project aims to sequence 100,000 genomes NHS patients with a rare disease, plus their families, and patients with cancer. The aim is to create a new genomic medicine service for the NHS - transforming the way people are cared for. We are the rst community healthcare trust to join this project. This was only possible with the support from the clinicians at the Children and Families division, and the genetics core team at University Hospitals Birmingham. 2. Virtual Innovation Forum: A virtual forum was set up for innovation where Technologies relevant to Community healthcare are showcased and for staff to submit their challenges and innovation ideas. These ideas are discussed at BCHC Committees to agree on whether they can be implemented. For example: A challenge submitted by a staff nurse around the issue of inability to use lights for taking notes at night in the wards as to not to disturb patients, but increasing the risk of errors such as medication errors. A couple of clip-on USB-rechargeable lights were purchased and delivered to the ward for testing and if successful, this solution will be rolled out across all wards.3. Innovation Engine 2: This European funded project which aims to facilitate collaborations with companies on innovative healthcare solutions/ products/ processes. It acts as a vehicle to facilitate involvement of BCHC in healthcare innovative solution development and trialling of novel technologies. 4.

Our Information Governance (IG) toolkit attainment level Information Governance is the way by which the NHS handles all organisational information, but particularly personal and sensitive information about patients and employees. It allows organisations and individuals to ensure that personal information is dealt with legally, ethically, con dentially, securely, ef ciently and effectively, in order to deliver the best possible care. The Information Governance toolkit measures our performance against 39 requirements. The Information Governance Assessment Report overall score for 2017-18 was 67% and was graded 'Green'. QR 49Clinical coding error rate Clinical Coding is \"the translation of medical terminology as written by the clinician to describe a patient's complaint, problem, diagnosis, treatment or reason for seeking medical attention, into a coded format\" which is nationally and internationally recognised. Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust was not subject to the Payment by Results clinical coding audit during 2017-18. Data Quality Reliable information is a fundamental requirement for the Trust to conduct its business efciently and effectively. This applies in all areas of activity including the delivery of care to service users, service management, contract and performance management, corporate governance, internal and external accountability and communication. This commitment includes governance, policy, process, training and monitoring. Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust will be taking the following actions to improve data quality: Managing Data Quality is about creating a culture of commitment to improving the quality of data. Accuracy - Data should represent what actually happened in the real world. It should do so sufciently closely to meet the reasons for which it is collected and maintained. Completeness - Data should be complete - should not contain extra, invalid or missing data Validity - Data should be recorded and maintained in compliance with relevant rules and denitions. Reliability - Data should be collected and processed consistently Timeliness - Data collection should be captured as quickly as necessary to support processes for which it is collected. Relevance / consistence - Data captured should be relevant and be maintained consistently to the purpose for which it is used Data Quality is the responsibility of all staff who record information whether on paper or by electronic means have a responsibility to take care and ensure that the data is accurate, as complete as possible and up to date. The Information Board ensures the Information Programme objectives are delivered including, creating intelligence and good quality Trust data to realise the benets of information improving in health and care outcomes. Every Key Performance Indicator (KPI) in the Trust Performance Scorecard is supported by three quality assurance indicators. This has been added to the information programme for 2018 as part of an improvement lifecycle.Section 2 QR 50Reporting against core indicators Care Programme Approach ReadmissionIndicator: the percentage of patients on Care Programme Approach who were followed up within seven days after discharge from psychiatric inpatient care during the reporting period.

This ensures that BCHC are fully involved with the pre-discharge process and can be proactive in planning follow up, which leads to both quality for patients and compliance internally and externally. Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust considers that this data is as described as clinical records evidence this with documented records of visits and meetings and will continue to maintain the high standard set. This indicator forms part of Domain 3 (Helping people to recover from episodes of ill health or following injury) and indicates the likelihood of the patient not recovering well due to requiring further medical treatment. This is a useful indicator for an acute hospital environment but less so for community beds. Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust operates a step up and step down facility in partnership with local acute hospitals. In terms of emergency readmissions, almost two thirds are as a result of non-elective transfers to our bedded units from acute trusts within the local health economy. Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: The data is sourced and processed from a nationally dened clinical data system and has been internally veried. Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust intends to take the following actions to improve this percentage and so the quality of its services, by producing regular reports to monitor compliance to support service improvement. QR 51The 2017 Staff Survey was the 15th annual national survey of NHS staff and ran from 14th September 2017 until 1st December 2017. BCHCFT commissioned Quality Health to carry out the survey. The sector average derives from the 12 community trust organisations, contracted to Quality Health. The national comparator group consists of 17 community trust organisations, including BCHCFT. This year the Trust responded to feedback from staff, including the Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) Staff Network, and for the rst time in ve years conducted a full census survey (inviting all staff to participate). We achieved 1868 responses resulting in a return rate of 40%, with 4713 staff invited to complete the survey. In 2016 the Trust conducted a sample survey of 1250 staff with 490 responding also equating to a 40% response rate. Therefore our real numbers response rate has greatly increased and will provide a greater depth of data for analysis; however our response rate remains below the national average of community trusts (50%). This year's staff survey action plan will deliver a targeted approach at divisional and corporate service level to promote the importance and value of completing the staff survey. Nationally, no formal league table is generated and there are many ways in which the data may be interpreted. Listening into Action (LiA) has produced a scatter map and league table for all 17 Community Trusts. Overall we are ranked 12th out of 17 trusts, which is an improved position from last year (14th). The national trend is that staff members feel less positive generally from last year and there has been a broad deterioration across the community sector with a few exceptions. 2017-2018 Ranking Community Trust name 1 Cambridgeshire Community Services 2 Derbyshire Community Health Services FT 3 Sussex Community FT 4 Central London Community Healthcare 5 Hounslow and Richmond Community Healthcare 6 Lincolnshire Community Health Services 7 Kent Community FT 8 Shropshire Community Health 9 Hertfordshire Community 10 Leeds Community Healthcare 11 Wirral Community FT 12 Birmingham Community Healthcare FT 13 Norfolk Community Health and Care 14 Liverpool Community Health 15 Bridgewater Community Healthcare FT 16 Staffordshire and Stoke on Trent Partnership 17 Gloucestershire Care Services Section 2 Staff Survey QR 52Acting on advice from Quality Health, the Trust has considered the overall staff engagement score as a key indicator to benchmark against other organisations.

This year the action plans will identify organisational wide priorities with specic target and outcome measures to achieve and divisional priorities to target areas identied within the report that are outliers. 3 of these yielded a positive improvement in comparison against the 2016 results: quality of appraisal, staff satisfaction with resourcing and support effective use of patient feedback.2 yielded negative shifts since 2016: percentage of staff reporting errors, near misses or incidents witnessed in the last month percentage of staff experiencing physical violence from patients, relatives or the public in the last 12 months. The remaining 27 Key Findings reported no change.Five priorities for action were identied in the 2016 Staff Survey Action Plan including: 1. Reducing workplace related stress through proactive Health & Wellbeing approaches and implementing an inclusive leadership approach 2. Improving the quality and leadership of 'Values based' Personal Development Reviews (PDR's) 3. Staff engagement - Adopting a Listening in action \"you said, together we did\" approach 4. Patient experience - identifying actions for improving the communication of patient feedback to staff delivering care 5. Leading a 'deep dive' and acting upon the evidence of staff experience of bullying and harassment. Improvements were seen against priorities 2 and 4 with no signicant change against the remaining three priority areas. Of particular note is the communication of patient feedback to staff which has seen the largest change since 2016.The Staff Survey is divided into 32 Key FindingsSection 2 QR 54Staff survey actions for 2018-19 1. Appraisal and support for development The focus during 2018 will be to support the divisions to improve the uptake and quality of appraisals so that all divisions are able to reach at least the national average comparator score 2. Equality and Diversity The priority for action will be to increase the percentage of people believing the organisation provides equal opportunities for career progression and promotion to at least the national average comparator score. Work is currently under way to develop and deliver a range of talent management and succession planning strategies in line with our current Workforce Race Equality Standards (WRES) and Workforce Disability Equality Standards (WDES) plans. The organisation has currently commissioned a review of our equality policies and procedures, which includes within the scope equal opportunities for career progression and promotion 3. Errors and Incidents This is a new organisational priority for action, which will focus on increasing the percentage of staff reporting errors, near misses or incidents and provide reassurance about how these would be handled, to encourage and reassure staff that their concerns will be treated seriously and with transparency. 4. Health and Wellbeing Reducing work related stress would remain an organisational priority. Focus will be on introducing new interventions to support the physical and mental health and wellbeing of our staff including the implementation of a Recovery College model in a health and wellbeing hub and working as a system partner to deliver the Birmingham and Solihull Sustainability and Transformation Plan. 5. Working patterns Whilst the Trusts overall score have improved additional support will be provided for the two divisions that have scored above the national comparator average for percentage of staff working extra hours. Next Steps During 2018 a schedule of 'Big Conversation' staff engagement events will be held to share the staff survey results and priorities and enable staff to share their experiences and let us know what would improve their working life. The conversations will inform the refresh of our vision and values and our service strategies and support the development and delivery of the Cultural Inclusion and Staff Engagement Strategy. We will be utilising a 'Pulse Check' tool in order for us to monitor levels of staff engagement and how valued staff feel. A Task force approach and structure is being implemented to deliver the priorities for action, led by the Director of Strategy and Transformation, Human Resources Director and Executive Director of Nursing and Therapies. Progress will be reported on a quarterly basis to Quality, Governance and Risk Committee (QGRC) and Management Board and will be shared regularly with staff through the current 'You Said, We Did' staff engagement campaign. QR 556. Job satisfaction The organisational priority for action will be to increase effective team working and staff motivation levels to at least the national average comparator score in the 2018 staff survey results. 7. Managers The priority for action will be to work with the divisions and corporate areas to increase the recognition and value of staff by managers and increase support provided by immediate managers to achieve at least the national average comparator score. 8. Patient care and experience The organisational focus will be on increasing the percentage of staff members who feel their role makes a difference to patients and service users to above the national average. We will also be undertaking a staff cultural temperature check throughout the year to enable on-going staff engagement in the improvement of patient care and experience. 9. Violence, harassment and bullyingReducing violence, harassment and bullying will remain an organisational priority. Focus will be on undertaking a deep dive against the six key ndings and to engage a range of stakeholders in the development and delivery of a priority action plan. Section 2 QR 56Venous thromboembolism (VTE) Clostridium difficileVenous thromboembolism (VTE) forms part of the work programme for patient safety, which is one of the Trust's quality priorities. Deaths from hospital acquired blood clots are preventable and, for this reason, all patients admitted to hospital should be assessed for their risk of developing blood clots and, if necessary, protection in the form of prophylactic treatment provided. Indicator: The percentage of patients who were admitted to hospital and who were risk assessed for venous thromboembolism during the reporting period.Throughout 2017-18 the Trust has continued to monitor the delivery of proactive risk assessments for VTE for patients admitted to the Trust. We began the year basing the reported compliance on an audit delivered each month as part of the Essential Care Indicators. Performance for those months is as shown in the graph below and was based on audits conducted in each ward of the Trust each month on a sample of patient records. Indicator: the rate per 100,000 bed days of cases of Clostridium difcile infection reported within the Trust amongst patients aged 2 or over during the reporting period. The Trust had 7 cases of Clostridium difcile infections in 2017-2018. All cases have a detailed route cause analysis completed which is reviewed by the commissioners all cases reviewed in 2017-2018 has been classed as unavoidable. This means that there was nothing the Trust could have done to prevent these cases. Two cases have not yet been reviewed this is due to take place in May 2018.8090100 Apr 17 96.93 May 17 98.61 Jun 17 99.65 Jul 17 98.28 Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) data is available, measured and monitored monthly using the NHS Safety Thermometer, monitoring the percentage of patients who were admitted to BCHC bedded areas. Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust has taken the following actions to improve this percentage, and so the quality of its services, by the following: The on-going development of our RIO patient information system meant that during the year we were able to move the recording of VTE assessments from a paper record to the electronic patient record (EPR). As a result from November 2017 we were able to report a full census of all patients admitted in the previous month and check for each patient whether a VTE assessment was recorded in their EPR. With this increased coverage it is pleasing to report that we have continued to achieve the 95% target and are now better able to identify areas where patients have been admitted but still require an assessment. 8090100 Nov 17 96.43 Dec 17 96.48 Jan 18 96.81 Feb 18 Mar 18 96.25 95.49 QR 57Indicator: Percentage of incomplete pathways within 18 weeks for patients on incomplete pathways at the end of the period. NHS guidance state that 92% of patients on a consultant led pathway need to start treatment within 18 weeks of referral. Our current performance is below. Patient waits under the 18 week referral to treatment targets are monitored under the Quality domain and are reported both nationally and to our local Commissioners. During 2017-18 it is positive therefore to report that the Trust has managed to achieve this target every month as shown in the graph and table below. The Trust continues to monitor this data and in particular carries out the following actions: daily Referral to Treatment (RTT) update reports accessible through the 1Vision on line reporting tool A monthly RTT working group Establishment of additional clinical session where patient lists are growing The use of Service Standard Operating Procedures which were reviewed and updated in 2017 Annual Audits of RTT processes by our Internal Auditor and Business Intelligence functions monthly RTT teleconference with services monthly service validation and sign off In addition the Trust monitors closely associated indicators of performance such as Urgent Referrals under Cancer 2 week waits.*Incomplete pathways Apr 17 May 17 Jun 17 Jul 17 Aug 17 Sept 17 Oct 17 Nov 17 Dec 17 Jan 18 Feb 18 Mar 17 Jun 17 Jul 17 Aug 17 Sept 17 Oct 17 Nov 17 Dec 17 Jan 18 Feb 18 pathway describes a patient who is waiting for treatment following referral to one of our services.Section 2 Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: Data is received from specimen laboratories directly. This data is also checked through a national database by commissioners monthly. Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust has taken the following actions to improve this number, and so the quality of its services, by ensuring that When a case of Clostridium difcile occurs on a ward an enhanced Clostridium difcile audit is completed by the infection, prevention and control team every week until the unit achieves a compliance score of 95% or above for 3 consecutive audits to ensure that good practice is imbedded into the unit. This tool gives us greater quality and assurance of control of Infection in the unit. *not a core indicator in line with guidance QR 58Patient Safety Incidents An incident is any event which has given rise to actual harm or injury or damage to/loss of property. This denition includes patient or client injury, re, theft, vandalism, assault and employee accident. It also includes incidents resulting from negligent acts, deliberate or unforeseen. Year Total Incidents Severe Harm/Death % 2017/18 7450 86 (45 Severe Harm/41 Death) 0.4 2015/16 7647 27 0.5 2014/15 8413 96 1.14 It is worthy of note that in October 2017, the Trust began reporting 'Unstageable' Pressure Ulcers through the datix system. This was not previously the case, with pressure ulcers being reported through datix when they had been conrmed as Grade 4 - categorised as severe harm. This explains the increase in incidents reported where 'Severe harm' was the result. Furthermore, the Trust also began to report all patient deaths in compliance with the National Quality Board 'National Guidance on Learning from Deaths' March 2017, which was reinforced by the ndings of the Care Quality Commission (CQC) report Learning, candour and accountability: A review of the way NHS trusts review and investigate the deaths of patients in England. Previously all in-patient deaths were subject to review, however, during 2017-18, all patient deaths notied to or noted by BCHC were reported. This included community patients with a Learning Disability, or adults who were visited by the Adult Community Services District Nursing teams, even if the death was not linked to BCHC care. The data above includes incidents reported under these criteria Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust considers that this data is as described because the Trust has a single incident reporting system (Datix) which can be accessed by all staff. Each incident is assigned a 'handler' who manages the incident to ensure that all information is accurate. Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust continues to introduce initiatives to ensure that the quality of its services remains high and that we learn from incidents. It is important, however, to emphasise that incident reporting is encouraged to ensure that the Trust is open and transparent.Indicator: The number and, where available, rate of patient safety incidents reported within the Trust during 2017-18, and the number and percentage of such patient safety incidents that resulted in severe harm or death. QR 59Reported incidents All incident data correct at 6 April 2018.During the period 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018 a total of 7,450 incidents have been reported.

This resulted in BCHC patient transport services being closed. Since the start of the Non Emergency Patient Transport (NEPT) contract, there has been a signicant increase in admission, transfer, discharge, access to services reported incidents. The issues are subject to contract review. Section 2 QR 60Learning from deaths During 2017-18, 207 of Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust patients died. This comprised the following number of deaths which occurred in each quarter of that reporting period: 51 in the rst quarter 55 in the second quarter 51 in the third quarter 50* in the fourth quarter. By 31st March 2018, 130 case record reviews and/investigations have been carried out in relation to the 207 of the deaths. In 130 cases a death was subjected to both a case record review and an investigation. The number of deaths in each quarter for which a case record review or an investigation was carried out was: 31 in the rst quarter 32 in the second quarter 36 in the third quarter 31* in the fourth quarter. Zero (0) representing 0% of the patient deaths during the reporting period are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. These numbers are exact using the Trigger Tool Case Note Review method applying the Hogan and Black scale. The learning identied from case record reviews is in relation to the deaths during the period 1st April 2017 to 28th February 2018. There are 5 phases of care learning as follows: Admission and Initial management: Clear concise timings, dates and designation of admitting clinician; diagnostic tests not completed; Lying and Standing Blood Pressure requested and evidence of completion not documented; recognition to past medical history in relation to care planning; nursing handover to the wards from Community Clinical Decision Unit Risk Assessments: Care planning is not patient centred, e.g. falls, nutrition and Hydration, including fluid management is inconsistent. On-going Care: Sepsis screening tool is not used routinely as a prompt to recognise and treat sepsis within the hour; National Early Warning Score (NEWS) not always routinely completed and to include the escalation effectively documented in the patient notes; timely monitoring and escalation of the diabetic patient End of Life Care: The earlier recognition of the dying patient to include the commencement of the Supportive Care Plan; supporting relatives and carers in achieving a dignied death; understanding the needs of the complex patient and the roles of medical and nursing staff in end of life care; improving communication between primary and secondary care. The actions from case record reviews is in relation to the deaths during the period 1st April 2017 to 28th February 2018. They are as follows: Admission and Initial management: Documentation Issues reviewed at the junior doctors journal club and the clinical effectiveness committee; Quality Improvement project for Lying and Standing Blood Pressure commenced; Care Planning and documentation quality improvement project commenced. Learning Actions QR 61Risk Assessments: Nutrition and Hydration and Fluid management is a key work stream and a quality improvement project On-going Care: Sepsis is a key work stream with a sepsis plan and sepsis boxes have been implemented and Sepsis training is on-going; Patient deterioration training is on-going. Diabetes management is a key work stream with plan; diabetes training is on going End of Life Care: The Care of the Dying Patient and Bereavement is a work stream with plan. End of life and Bereavement is reviewed at the junior doctors' journal club and the divisional end of life group. The impact from case record reviews is in relation to the deaths during the period 1st April 2017 to 28th February 2018. They are as follows: Admission and Initial management: Documentation audit, Essential Care Indicators used to monitor the impact; Lying and Standing Blood Pressure at Safety Express; Care Planning and nursing hand over to wards at the Clinical Effectiveness Committee Risk Assessments: Care Planning and documentation quality Improvement Project; Nutrition and Hydration and Fluid management - impact is monitored at the inpatient Clinical Effectiveness Committee, the Hydration Group and Safety Express. On-going Care: The Sepsis plan and work programme is monitored at the Sepsis Group and to the Mortality and Deteriorating Patients Committee; Patient deterioration incidents are reviewed at the Mortality and Deteriorating Patients Committee; The Diabetes plan and work programme is monitored at the Diabetes Group and includes a review of incidents and training. End of Life Care: End of life and Bereavement plan monitored through the Mortality and Deteriorating Patients Committee. 10 case record reviews and 10 investigations completed after 31 March 2017 which related to deaths which took place before 31 March 2017. These reviews were undertaken in the month of April 2017 and wholly related to patient deaths that occurred in March 2017. Zero (0) representing 0% of the patient deaths before 31 March 2018, are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient.

During the period 2017-18, the Trust had two Never Events reported at the Birmingham Dental Hospital. The incidents were classi ed as 'Wrong site surgery' and related to the anaesthesia (block) being administered to the wrong side prior to a planned tooth extraction. In one case the planned extraction continued at the request of the patient after the error had been noted. No harm was caused to either patient. The incidents took place in October 2017 and January 2018. The Sickness Absence rate at 2017-18 year end was 6.09% against a target of 4.3%. Later updates to sickness records has resulted in a small reduction in March Sickness (5.91%). The 12 month average for the year was 5.66%, compared to last year's results of 5.34%. This represents a disappointing year in terms of sickness absence management. Inspite of a range of initiatives and programmes and careful application of policies the majority of Divisions have generally struggled to meet targets throughout the year. Stress and Anxiety has continued to be the largest cause of absence followed by muskulo-skeletal (MSK) problems. It is noted that winter fl u, signi cant workforce change programmes and the impact on staff of meeting service capacity demands have been factors throughout the year. An overall review of Sickness Absence Management and a focus on staff engagement and staff health and wellbeing will be key priorities for 2018-19. The Trust continues to work with its occupational health provider to improve ef ciencies and has been piloting a more effective method of managing appointments which had seen a reduction of staff not attending (DNAs).Improving sickness absence levels David Holmes Director of Human Resources QR 65Staff apraisal Patient feedbackSection 3 The Trust requires all employees to take part in an annual Personal Development Review (PDR) or appraisal discussion. This investment in the workforce is key to achieving the Trust's corporate objectives, supporting organisational values and service improvement. As can be seen from the gures on page 64, our position has worsened slightly this year, although results from the 2017 staff survey indicate that the quality of appraisal has improved. Focussed support is provided in areas of non-compliance, and the appraisal process is currently being refreshed to improve the quality of appraisal even further. Staff appraisals are recognised as a key component of good workforce planning and will continue to be an area of key focus. Heather Wilby Head of Learning and Development As a result of patient feedback here are some of the changes we have made at the Birmingham Dental Hospital Car parking - Previously pay on entrance: Patients were being over charged not knowing how long to put on the parking meters, or having to return to the meters mid treatment to add more time. A new pay on exit system has been installed Information on screens - Patients feedback regarding lengthy waiting times and little to keep them occupied: News and weather is now displayed in all waiting areas along with important patient information. 'Are you a new patient' leafl et - Feedback from new patients being seen for a consultation suggested that it was unclear why they should expect to be at the hospital for a minimum of three hours. The leafl et outlines what is involved at their appointment. Outcome letters sent to patients - Routine correspondence was not previously copied to patients: Since November's quality committee it has been agreed that from immediate effect all correspondence will now be copied. This provides patients with information being shared about them and prevents them having to make contact to request the information via an access to records request. QR 66Safety Themometer It has been six years since the NHS Classic Safety Thermometer survey commenced in an effort to reduce avoidable harm in relation to four common harms, detailed below, experienced by patients. The implementation of Safety Express and embedding the NHS Classic Safety Thermometer survey as a measurement tool continued to work well this year as one of the Trust's patient safety objectives and quality priority. The Trust's ambition of delivering 95% HarmFREE Care measured by the NHS Classic Safety Thermometer has been exceeded throughout the year and our objective is to eliminate avoidable harm and protect patients from four common conditions which are: Pressure Ulcers Harm from Falls Catheter associated Urinary Tract Infections (CaUTIs) New Venous Thromboembolism (blood clots: VTE/DVT/PE). We said that we would continue to measure and monitor delivery of this objective. Table 1 below, illustrates that the Trust has achieved this and has exceeded 95% HarmFREE Care for all patient harms whether they are old harms or new harms. Old harms being those the patient experienced before coming into our care, and new harms being those the patient has experienced during our care. Table 1 further illustrates that 0.50% of patients surveyed over the course of the year experienced a new harm, as 99.50% of our patients were HarmFREE compared with the national gure of 94.25% This information is collected on a set day every month as a snapshot in time and represents an improvement over the year compared with last year.

For the Children and Families Division the sample is restricted to the community nursing teams and the inpatient respite beds. Although no longer a CQUIN, the requirements to complete the NHS Classic Safety Thermometer survey remain the same. The NHS Safety Thermometer Programme Manager supports teams to ensure that we achieve 100% compliance and this year the Trust has sampled 26,132 patients and 25,656 were free of the four common harms.

The Trust NICE Review Group (sub-group to Trust the Clinical Effectiveness Committee) consists of a membership which represents and supports trust wide consultation of new and updated NICE guidelines and assessment of their relevance trust services. This year (April 2017- March 2018) the NICE Review Group (NRG) reviewed a total of 322 clinical guidance or Quality standards as well as co-ordinating, receiving feedback and advising on existing work to evidence care locally within their areas of Expertise/Divisionally. 185 of these guidance's and standards reviewed were identi ed by the NRG membership to have potential for relevance within clinical or corporate services and were subsequently forwarded as appropriate utilising the Risk Management Datix Alert system for either information or appraisal. Evidence of compliance with NICE recommendations and standard statements must ultimately provide trust assurance and can therefore be a very involved and lengthy process. A total of 42 pieces of work which provided evidence of trust compliance in the form of completed worksheets were agreed and approved through the Trust committee process. A further 16 action plans were also agreed and approved through the Trust committee process which have identi ed key pieces of work currently being undertaken to ensure care provision is optimised and care outcomes maximised. This also supports services/clinicians to participate in quality improvement programmes under the umbrella of the NICE Implementation Programme. Next Steps... The programme is committed to increasing the total of completed evidence work sheets by 6 per cent for year 2018-2019. Section 3 CREWS QR 70Same Sex Accommodation Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust is committed to providing every patient with same sex accommodation because it helps to safeguard their privacy and dignity when they are often at their most vulnerable. BCHC is pleased to confi rm that we are compliant with the government's requirement to eliminate mixed-sex accommodation, except when it is in the patient's overall best interest, or refl ects their personal choice. Every patient has the right to receive high quality care that is safe, effective and respects their privacy and dignity. We have the necessary facilities, resources and culture to ensure that patients who are admitted to our hospitals will only share the room where they sleep with members of the same sex, and same-sex toilets and bathrooms will be close to their bed area. Sharing with members of the opposite sex will only happen when clinically necessary (for example, where patients need specialist equipment such as in the provision of specialist bathrooms which cannot be designated as single sex), or when patients actively choose to share. This achievement is regularly monitored and if our care should fall short of the required standard, we will report it. We have also set up an audit mechanism to make sure that we do not misclassify any of our reports. There were no breaches of the standards in 2017-18. The review of compliance forms part of our annual audit programme and each bedded unit has had an assessment following the template developed by the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement. This audit has confi rmed overall compliance and there were no breaches of the standards in 2017-18. CREWS QR 71In 2017-18 the safeguarding Adults team completed four patient stories. This was identifi ed by Commissioners as a key performance indicator. The requirement was for us to produce one adult patient story each quarter, directly from the perspective of the service user and in their own words and to demonstrate how the patient voice has been shared with relevant staff and used as a means of refl ecting on their practice in addition to any wider learning disseminated across the organisation. The patient stories demonstrated the voice of the adult being heard, and is integral to person centred safeguarding practice within BCHC. The patients identifi ed needed to have capacity to consent, the cases included areas of abuse and concerns relating to neglect, fi nancial abuse, physical abuse and psychological/emotional abuse. During 2017-18 the safegurding adult team reviewed and updated a number of policies to take into account changes in practice, guidance and legislation and also learning from high level external reports e.g Reports of the NHS investigations into Jimmy Savile. These include: Safeguarding Adults Policy Mental Capacity Act Policy Deprivation of liberty safeguards polic Chaperones Policy, Safe and Therapeutic Responses to Distressed Behavior Including Physical Intervention Policy the Locked Door Policy Training Strategy for Safeguarding Adults Domestic Abuse Policy Safeguarding Adults Supervision Policy Persons in a Position of Trust Policy, 'VIP'/Celebrity/Media Representative Access Policy. The safeguarding adult team have contributed to other Trust polices as relevant. During 2017-18 the safeguarding adult team have continued to provide training both as e-learning packages and face to face and the trust met its compliance targets for safeguarding adults, Mental capacity, Deprivation of liberty (DoLs) and Prevent training. The Safeguarding team have also contributed to a number of internal quality reviews undertaken across the trust with a particular focus on safeguarding issues , implementation of the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) and the deprivation of liberty safeguards and the Care Act. The team undertook an number of audits across the trust including Customer Service Satisfaction Survey, Response Time Audit and the Safeguarding Adults, MCA and DoLS audit. Safeguarding Adults Quality review Section 3 CREWS QR 72All patients should receive safe and high quality nutrition and hydration support when required, through the commissioning of person-centred and clinically effective integrated services. In 2015 NHS England published a guidance document on commissioning excellent nutrition and hydration care. Providing good nutrition and hydration aligns with several Trust quality priorities and Trust values and therefore a CQUIN was commissioned for its second year in 2017-2018. Individuals who have underlying health problems are at a greater risk of becoming malnourished or dehydrated. Factors which affect nutritional intake are complex and multifactorial, but in the simplest terms the result of reduced intake means that over time individuals are not getting suf cient nutrition to maintain a normal level of functioning. This in turn can result in frailty, which can lead to further complications such as increased risk of falls or the development of pressure ulcers. Several work streams have taken place throughout the duration of the CQUIN. One key objective was to raise awareness within inpatient staff of the key role that nutrition and hydration plays in the wellbeing and recovery of our service users. This was achieved though the development of a ward based training programme. Due to the small group sizes, the workshop style sessions encouraged staff engagement and peer to peer learning, as staff discussed the challenges they face and were encouraged to consider solutions to which they could contribute within their role. In addition to training, existing care plans were revised to create a holistic nutrition and hydration care plan to identify and act on the individual needs of each patient. A new hydration screening tool was developed and integrated within the care plan to help staff to recognise those patients who are not drinking suf ciently and have clear care plan actions to implement to support those individuals. Using CQUIN to improve nutrition and hydration Nutrition helps with healing and rehabilitation and to prevent pressure sores I always try to encourage patients to drink more CREWS I feel that sta at the unit do well with nutrition and hydration, patients are given drinks regularly and during mealtimes. All sta participate and help to feed patients, also food diary documentation is done well QR 73A patient information leafl et was developed to empower patients and their families to recognise the risks and indicators of malnutrition or dehydration, as well asproviding tips for eating well or improving food and fl uid intake if necessary. Several audits have been carried out over the course of the CQUIN, and show a positive progression in how both malnutrition is recognised and managed at ward level. Staff have offered their own feedback on the training and care plans, which captured both the effectiveness of the training and also recognition of the importance of identifying malnutrition and dehydration, and how this impacts overall on patient care. The CQUIN has been a fantastic opportunity to raise awareness of just how important it is to provide the right nutrition and adequate hydration for each of our patients. It has given us the chance to support staff in recognising that everyone has individual needs and to build their con dence to work with patients to ensure these needs are met. The CQUIN is due to come to a close in March 2018 and this will be marked with a Trust wide event to build on all of the work that has been done to acknowledge this important issue, with an aim that the focus and training that has been delivered will have long lasting bene t to individuals under the care of BCHC. Next steps... Building on the success of the Nutrition and Hydration Care CQUIN in 2016-17 and 2017-18, a comprehensive Nutrition and Hydration Improvement Programme will be rolled out to Community District Nursing teams throughout 2018-19 with nominated leads who will champion the CQUIN in each team. Section 3 QR 74In 2017 Urgent Care Services worked alongside WMQRS to develop a set of bespoke Quality Standards. These Quality Standards were developed to support the implementation of the new bed model within Urgent Care Services division. The Standards are based on existing WMQRS which were tailored for the division through a workshop involving a wide range of clinicians and through circulation to all services for comment. Aims of the Quality Standards: The Quality Standards aim to improve the quality of services and to help to answer the question: \"For each service, how will I know that national guidance and evidence of best practice have been implemented?\" They describe what services should be aiming to provide: All services should be moving towards meeting all applicable Quality Standards within the next two to ve years.Working in collaboration with West Midlands Quality Review Service (WMQRS) The Standards also: Can support service improvement through self-assessment and internal review Can help services to share good practice Provide BCHC with a framework for assuring the quality of the new bed model Can help service users and carers to know more about the services they can expect And be used to provide on information on service quality for commissioners and the CQC Quality Standards are also cross-referenced to British Standards Institute, Care Quality Commission and NHSLA Standards Scope of the Quality Standards The Standards for the Community Clinical Decisions Unit and Wards 5 and 6 are based on the Acute Medical Admissions Units section of the WMQRS Urgent Care Quality Standards (V3, 2016). Those for intermediate and palliative care are based on the WMQRS Quality Standards for Transfer from Acute Hospital Care and Intermediate Care (V1, 2016). The Standards also draw on those for Care of People Living with Frailty (V2, 2015).

It provides con dential impartial advice and support to patients and staff, helping to sort out concerns or queries people have about their care and treatment. The team also help enquirers navigate the services provided by the Trust and signpost them to appropriate points of contact within the Trust. The customer service team is part of the wider patient experience team for the Trust. When concerns are raised with the Customer Service Team they work with the service to resolve the issue wherever possible. Where themes and trends emerge, these are escalated to the Associate Director of Patient Experience.Customer Service Responding to our callers and clinical services We have continued to work with services to gain better understanding of their provision, in order to give immediate information and support to callers. This has worked well and in turn has improved working relationships with the Customer service team and Community Paediatric Doctors and District Nursing service. Customer services have supported various clinical services in staff training in particular on how to manage dif cult calls and coached staff on how best to respond and support the patients, one example being Central Booking service.

They were initially developed as nursing metrics in Blackpool and Fylde NHS Trust and have been adapted by BCHC for use in adult inpatient units, district nursing teams and bedded units and community teams for people with learning disabilities.The metric reports form a key part of the monthly quality reporting for the Board and are also fed back to teams and operational managers for rapid improvement. The metrics are collected monthly and are used as one of the early warning signs to tell us where teams need more support or further assessment of standards. The Trust has a dashboard tool for reporting the ECI results and available on our internal website for staff to access.

During 2017-2018 the Safeguarding Children Team successfully delivered a series of Early Help awareness training to Children's and Families Division staff and additional Early Help Support to Health Visitors. The training was delivered in partnership with the Early Help Support Team from the Local Authority demonstrating a model of best practice and joint working. The need for this training and support was driven following an OFSTED inspection of Birmingham Local Authority Children's Services in October 2016 that encouraged partner agencies to be proactive in identifying, initiating, co-ordinating, and providing support for children and families in need of additional support. Serious Case Reviews have also highlighted the value of Early Help work with Families. Professor Eileen Munro's Review of Child Protection: Final Report - A child-centred system (2011). Recommended that Local Authorities should specify how they will identify children who are suffering or who are likely to suffer signi cant harm and where a child is identi ed as having needs that fall below the level at which statutory intervention from Children's Social Care is required, that they should receive an 'early help offer 'of carefully tailored support to meet their needs.The Safeguarding Children Team have embraced this approach and this is refl ected within Safeguarding supervision, advice and support given to practitioners. The Local Safeguarding Boards also include Early Help as a priority. It is important for practitioners to recognise that although they themselves may not always be able to provide the help needed, there are other agencies that can that families may not be aware of, and a discussion, advice, and signposting is often an effective and timely early help response - every contact counts. The training delivered by BCHC Safeguarding Children Team aims to help the practitioner to understand their own agency response and obligations in Early Help and the process and tools available to them to support them doing this. Implementation of Early Help Approach to Safeguarding Children The training was delivered in partnership with the Early Help Support Team CREWS QR 79To support the application of this into practice, innovative workshop style training has also been offered which included additional content around engagement, practical exercises using assessment tools, and practice conversations where they can practice having often dif cult conversations where they need to engage families and gain consent in the Early Help process in order to stop concerns escalating to a point where they require statutory Children's Social Care intervention, and to increase the likelihood of positive outcomes for children. The training and workshops have evaluated very well.Next steps... The next steps are to continue to roll out the sessions into the coming year to the wider workforce within Children and Family's Division to include School Nursing and Special School Nursing services. Every contact countsA discussion, advice, and signposting is often an e ective and timely early help response Section 3 QR 80Friends and Family Test (FFT) The Friends and Family Test seeks to understand whether patients would recommend the service to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment. It is an important opportunity for patients to provide feedback on the care and treatment they have received to improve services. This means patients give feedback on the quality of the care they receive, giving the Trust a better understanding of the needs of patients and enabling improvements. Patients are invited to respond to the question by choosing one of six options, ranging from 'extremely likely' to 'extremely unlikely'. It is important that patients are given the opportunity to explain why they have given their answer, as these comments give us a rich source of information about where and how services can be improved. Opposite is a summary of the FFT responses for 2017-18.

The objective is to engage staff at all levels, through effective leadership, in order to develop and embed a culture that supports infection prevention and control across the organisation. Hand decontamination is a fundamental principle in preventing the spread of healthcare associated infections; in fact 'hand washing' is the single most effective measure to prevent cross infection. Hand hygiene audit (the Lewisham tool) has continued across the Trust's inpatient areas and a compliance target agreed at 95%. The Trust has achieved compliance each month during 2017-2018. The audit involved the IPCT observing practice in each inpatient area every month. The advantage of this approach is that the IPCT can provide ad hoc training to staff if non compliance is observed and real time feedback given to those involved. Hand Washing Month Compliance Score April QR 83Audits have been completed in line with the annual audit programme. The Infection Prevention and Control team audit clinical areas using national tools to enable bench marking against other departments and organisations. In 2017-2018 clinical practice observational audits were carried out by ward based link workers, these audits are designed to highlighted areas for improvement for clinical teams and the consistently achieved compliance demonstrates the high level of Infection Prevention and Control standards within the inpatient units. Frontline health and social care workers have a duty of care to protect their patients and service users from infection. This includes getting vaccinated against flu. The impact of flu on frail and vulnerable people in communities, care homes, and in hospitals can be fatal. In addition, immunisation against influenza should forms part of the organisations' policy for the prevention of transmission of influenza to protect patients, residents, service users, staff and visitors. An increase in vaccination rate of 4.3% compared to the 2016-17 uptake for clinical staff and equates to an additional 404 vaccines overall administered. The Trust has utilised 21 peer vaccinators this year, these staff have given vaccines at staff bases to increase uptake. The Trust is looking to recruit more staff this year to the programme. The Trust has formed a Water safety group as a sub group to Infection Prevention and Control Committee, this group was formed to ensure appropriate safety measure are in place to manage water systems ensuring that any risk in the system is reduced. Work completed by the group included the ratication of a Water safety Policy to support the management of water systems. The group is currently working on producing a water safety plan for the Trust based on local risk assessment and recommendations.Infection Prevention and Control Audits Staff influenza vaccination programme Water SafetyTarget Apr 17 May 17 Jun 17 Jul 17 Aug 17 Compliance with agreed infection prevention audit for PVC care95% 100% 100% 97% 99% 98% Compliance care95% 99% 99% 98% 98% 99% Sept 17 Oct 17 Nov 17 Dec 17 Jan 18 Feb 18 Mar Complaints by Division Total Activity and Number of Complaints per 10,000 contactsDivisionNumber of Complaints 2017-18 2016-17 Dental 50 50 Adult Community Services 49 57 Children and Families 32 31 Urgent Care Services 28 34 Corporate 2 - Specialist 22 Rehabilitation 12 18 Learning Disability 5 4 2017-18 2016-17 2015-16 Activity 1,867,810 1,884,762 1,997,367 Number of 239 Number of complaints per 10,000 contacts0.95 1 1Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust aims to provide consistently high quality services but recognises that patients, service users and carers may from time to time be concerned about, or dissatis ed with the care and treatment they have received.

PLACE assessments for Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, commenced in January 2017 until May 2017. The assessments are led by local people (known as Patient Assessors) going into our inpatient buildings with 10 or more beds as part of teams to assess how the environment supports the provision of clinical care, assessing such things as privacy and dignity, food, cleanliness and general building maintenance and, more recently, the extent to which the environment is able to support the care of those with dementia.

QR 88BCHC is on a journey towards excellence in the way that we demonstrate, but more importantly, how our staff, patients, service users, carers ad community experience equality in their dealings with the Trust. Raising the Bar on Equality The demand for transparent analysis, publication and improvement systems which respond to evidence of unwarranted variation in the employment and patient experience against the Protected Characteristics has increased exponentially. This increase has surpassed the ability of the organisations capacity and capability to respond in the timely and sophisticated manner in which the Equality Act 2010 demands. The 'standard' approach to equality, which started with the Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES) in 2015, and now includes the Workforce Disability Standard (WDES), Accessible Information Standard (AIS), is indicative of a policy shift intended to reprioritise equality and raise the bar on the levels of compliance to Equality legislation. The Gender Equality Pay Duty sheds a light not only on the pay disparity which exists between women and men but begins another conversation about gender inequalities and how we create gender friendly workforce cultures. The scale and pace of change in equality is set to increase rapidly in the next year and In order to respond to this regulatory and contractual target a fresh approach is required to make equality everyone's business. Workforce Race Equality Standard There is a clear business case for diversity within the workforce for BCHC as over 80 per cent of our services are delivered to the residents of Birmingham which is a City of Super - Diversity in which over 103 languages are spoken. The need to reflect the local population at all levels of the organisation has been a key focus of activity which has taken place over the last year. Alongside this the Trust Board engaged in a reverse mentoring process with staff from Black or Minority Ethnic (BME) background to better understand the experiences of BME staff. This activity has served as meaningful engagement of a seldom heard group of staff whose experience continues to mean that they are less likely to believe that the organisation provides equal opportunities for career progression and are more likely to experience harassment bullying and abuse from staff. In terms of this year's staff survey, we discovered that 46 per cent of staff who reported experiencing discrimination, felt that this was on the grounds of ethnicity. Looking at the data for discrimination across the 9 Protected Characteristics, a signicant number of staff reported 'other' as grounds for discrimination, followed by age, gender, disability, religion and sexual orientation at 3%. Across all of the Protected Characteristics, BME staff featured strongly which demonstrates the intersectionality of discrimination and that staff feel they are experiencing discrimination on multiple grounds.Compliance to Excellence - Equality, Diversity & Human Rights (EDHR) Ethnicity 2016 2017 % Improvement/deterioration Percentage of staff believing that the organisation provides equal opportunities for career progression or promotionWhite 88% 85% -3% BME 68% 64% -4% Percentage of staff experiencing harassment, bullying or abuse from staff in last 12 months Pay Equality Duty For the rst time this year public sector organisations were required to publish Gender Pay Equality data to identify any disparities in pay based on Gender. BCHC has a pay gap of 13% which in comparison with other NHS organisation placed us in an average position. However, as an organisation our ambitions to be an exemplar employer and service provider means that we commit to proactively identifying areas where gender inequality may prevent equal access and career progression. We will strive to create a culture where all our staff may fl ourish and thrive. Equality Review The Trust has recently commissioned a review of the equality function to obtain expert guidance and advice on the capacity and capability required to deliver on the growing equality portfolio. The review will also inform the development of a broader culture and engagement strategy and provide an expert and evidence based approach which will sit within a governance framework which assures transparency, fairness and equality for staff and patients. Next Steps... Following the completion of the equality review, an equality transformation programme will seek to increase compliance and move towards aspirational targets which are systematically embedded across the organisation. Equality is everybody's business and this ambition will be formalised in the next year to position the Trust to move beyond compliance and deliver excellence for all our staff and patients, regardless of background. CREWS QR 90Section 4 Statement from Associate Director of Clinical GovernanceQR 92 Achievement Stories QR 93 BCHC Charity QR 105 QR 91This has been a testing year to deliver quality care in the NHS but I believe Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust rose to the challenge and improved on the services delivered to patients. The Trust was sad to lose the contract for school nursing in Staffordshire, but the move was marked with an event which celebrated the many achievements that we had shared in only two brief but productive years. The Trust retained the contract for the care of children under the age of 5 and is working with a number of partners to deliver the revised agreement. The Research and Innovation team have supported the work of the divisions to develop new and creative ways of delivering care, working with local businesses to provide the technical support. Services now participate in many more national clinical audits than in previous years on topics ranging from stroke care, to diabetes and Parkinson's disease. Clinical staff presented their ndings on clinical outcomes at a number of conferences, including results from parent classes for children with autism to support their understanding of their child's condition, and dietetic treatment for irritable bowel syndrome. A number of new clinical interventions were agreed this year, paediatric physiotherapy using constraint induced therapy for patients with a weakness in one arm, while other clinicians used video recording the support the diagnosis of children with autism. There are now a calendar of events run by divisional and corporate teams to which staff and the public are invited to applaud the work that has been done to enhance the effectiveness of clinical treatment by teams and also to improve the safety of the care we provide. This section provides us with a snapshot of some of the achievements and improvements we have made this year.

The patient safety ambassadors campaign offers structured training to give staff the tools and techniques to put their own patient safety ideas into action. The programme is open to clinical and non-clinical staff at all levels within the organisation. Director of nursing and therapies Gareth Howells said: \"This campaign is fully supported by the executive team and the divisional directors of nursing.It links with our organisational and development strategy and also demonstrates the 'well-led' domain set out by the Care Quality Commission.\" Following a celebration event at which a cohort of ambassadors shared progress on their projects. Gareth said: \"I was impressed by the energy, passion and commitment from the presenters and know they will take that good work back into their service areas and spread the word.\" Some of the stories below are examples of projects that were a result of the Patient Safety Ambassador programme.Ambassadors programme supports continuous improvement Visions for the Vulnerable The British Dental Association Community Dental Services Group West Midlands Division Annual Study Day this year was entitled Visions for the Vulnerable. There were presentations from various speakers including topics regarding dental care for vulnerable adults and children. There was an emphasis on safeguarding with the nal presentation of the day summarising a leadership project to address the issue of 'Was Not Brought' also known as 'Did Not Attend' for paediatric dental appointments in the Shefeld Community Dental Service. It highlighted safeguarding issues and raised the awareness of children not attending many appointments as an indicator of abuse. In addition, for services this meant wasted clinical time limiting access to care for other patients. Some of the lessons learnt and changes implemented in Shefeld will be used to re-evaluate the current processes in Special Care Dental Service patients in BCHC for the patients who do not attend or are recalled. The aim of the project will be to ensure the effective management of patients who are under the service for continuing care, better utilisation for team skill mix, and timely communication with General Medical Practitioners when there are potential safeguarding issues. The Dental Division Safeguarding Committee are currently developing a policy for patients over 18 who do not attend clinics and there is a plan for a pilot project to be set up to evaluate the proposed pathway to ensure it is workable and addresses the needs of the patients and service. QR 93Ward 'huddles' sharpen team focus on quality and safety Inpatient teams at Moseley Hall Hospital launched a new early morning initiative to improve care quality and patient safety on their wards. All clinical staff on wards 6, 8 and 9 have introduced a daily multidisciplinary 'safety huddle' - a standardised, focussed opportunity to raise issues such as location of particular patients in the ward, falls, discharge planning, patient transport or overnight changes in an individual's personal or clinical needs. Non-clinical members of the teams such as admin staff, housekeepers and porters are also welcome to join the huddle. Ward 6 consultant Dr Salim Dawood said the initiative has empowered colleagues. \"I've noticed I'm more frequently approached by staff to discuss patient outcomes since the start of the huddles\", he said. \"Staff are more con dent and barriers are being removed.\" Clinical team leader Rebecca Halford added: \"Team involvement has been the key to success of this new initiative - our huddles are now being initiated and led by other team members.\"Ward 9 physiotherapist Shawab Mir said that ongoing review feeds into a continuous sharpening of focus on the particular needs of each patient. \"Initially, we attempted to cover many topics, but in reality we achieved very little\", he said. \"So we altered it to cover areas of particular concern to our ward, which has been much more effective.\" Learning disability services at Kingswood Drive and Riverside Lodge have also introduced safety huddles as part of the trust's commitment to quality improvement. Patient safety lead Julie Jones said teams have noted positive impacts since introducing the huddles, reporting more openness between colleagues and quicker decision-making. \"Standardising the way the team can keep up-to-date on the latest issues has produced a team engagement mechanism to resolve issues quickly,\" she said.

Bright green backpacks decorated with turtles are to be issued to families to store and transport their child's medication after junior sister Sharon Hodgson approached BCHC charity to fund the scheme. With the support of the trust's safety ambassador quality programme, Sharon had reviewed medication storage and working environment, documentation, parental understanding and medication reconciliation and came up with the idea of a standardised pack to issue to families. \"I identi ed that the way in which medications were supplied to Edgewood Road from home was often disorganised\", she said. Staff had no clear process of knowing where to source the medication as parents were placing medication bottles in various bags and we were nding ourselves searching through multiple pieces of luggage to source the expected medication. Parents were educated about the standard we expect the medication to be supplied in, but we had no control over how they packed the items. The aim of the backpacks is to have an easily identi able container for parents to supply every piece of medication in. All the medication will now be able to be sourced and secured as soon as the children arrive in our care. This frees up time for nursing staff to complete their initial assessments of the child, knowing that all medications are safely secured away in the new individual draw drugs trolley that was also purchased as part of the safety improvements.\"Medicine management in the bag! A further improvement is the introduction of folders, to be kept in the backpacks, providing documentation to improve communication between consultants, paediatricians and GPs over changes in medication, helping to avoid delays or, potentially, the cancellation of a respite stay.

CREWS QR 95Physiotherapists help retired railwayman steer weight back on track When John Fancote's chair collapsed under him, he knew there was no further denying the need to dramatically reduce his weight. The retired railway engineer had weighed more than 30 stones for most of his adult life, peaking at 36 stones. Following the accident, John was taken to hospital with minor injuries, but ended up spending a full ve months as an inpatient while preparations were made to ensure he could return home safely. His extended stay in hospital was the 'wake up' John needed. With the help of the team at Moseley Hall and growing self-restraint, John managed to lose about three stones through physiotherapy and reduced eating before being discharged. Three years on, the continuing support of BCHC's adult community physiotherapy service means he is on track to becoming literally half the man he used to be - but it took an ultimatum from senior physiotherapist Sarah Broom eld to stop the former railway worker in his tracks. \"We agreed an exercise and mobility plan with rehab assistants visiting regularly. But he would only do it when we were there,\" says Sarah. \"It was lack of con dence, more than anything.\" John became involved in a patient focus group to help develop a walking frame-mounted falls prevention device and describes the physiotherapy team's support as \"truly life-changing\". \"I was getting good advice and was desperate to get out of the house; but I just needed to nd my own way to tackle the problem,\" he says. \"I'm so grateful for the support I've had. They were hard on me at times, but always fair. I needed it.\" Healthcare assistants' conference A group of healthcare assistants (HCAs) and therapy assistants from a variety of BCHC services recently attended a national conference in London to discuss the 'leading change, adding value' framework. The NHS England conference aimed to highlight the framework, which all healthcare professionals can use to achieve a positive impact on outcomes, experience and use of resources. BCHC HCA Jean Dipple said: \"As the group of staff that statistically has the most contact with patients, the impact we can have could be huge. Positive interactions will make every contact count.\" The event also discussed the concept of 'unwarranted variation' - ensuring services and outcomes are consistent across departments, organisations and regions. Jean added: \"There was a great deal of information to take in but it did refl ect that healthcare and support staff are valued and can lead, shape and deliver this framework - which made us all feel proud and excited for the future.\" For more information visit www.england. nhs.uk/leadingchange. Section 4 CREWS CREWS QR 96The Trust is trialling a new walking aid to support patients prone to falls. The 'Step Right Buddy' is a simple accessory that can be added to a walking frame to guide patients who have experienced dif culties using a frame. The invention was the brainchild of rehabilitation assistant Carole Owen, who rst came up with the idea during a community visit. Carole said: \"When patients rst use a walking frame, they are given information on how to use it safely. For a small group of patients however, using a frame is dif cult. \"I went to see a patient who is partially sighted and was prone to falling backwards when using the frame. This is usually an indication that the patient is walking too far into the frame, causing them to lose balance and fall. \"She needed something to stop her from getting too close to the frame - my 'light bulb' moment was a pair of tights! I tied them round the top of the back legs of the frame to act as a fl exible barrier...and they worked!\" Carole wanted to nd a more permanent solution that she could try out with other patients so she contacted the research and innovation team who helped Carole launch a trial, enlisting support from Dr Sarah-Jane Jones and Helen Lowe from Birmingham City University and BCHC neuro physiotherapist Faye Dimmock. Carole's detachable elastic band prototype was tested with a group of patients, who were asked to use the buddy on their walking frame for a week. Feedback has been positive, with many users saying the band had corrected posture and that the concept had potential. An application for funding from the Health Foundation was being considered and a manufacturer sought.Buddy band is a step in the right direction CREWS QR 97Wayne Trowbridge's life changed forever when he lost control of his motorbike and collided with a telegraph pole, sustaining multiple life-threatening injuries. The 36-year-old was taken by air ambulance to Queen Elizabeth Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery before a 16-week stay in the inpatient neurological rehabilitation unit at Moseley Hall Hospital. \"When I was transferred to Moseley Hall hospital, my rst impression was 'what time could I expect Florence Nightingale to tuck me in at night?'! \"I couldn't have been more wrong - a hospital ward is only as good as the staff and I can say from rst-hand experience that every single person I had the pleasure of meeting during my time on ward 9 was professional, hardworking and compassionate. I was included in decisions about my care and I cannot thank the staff enough for the way I was treated during my time there. \"I'm sure many of the staff on ward 9 would vouch for that fact that I had many a dark time during my stay, but they allowed me to vent, and were always there to calm me down and reassure me that my feelings were perfectly natural. \"The brain is such a powerful and intelligent computer - it is what makes you unique from every other person. However, when it is injured or malfunctions it can't simply be xed by putting on a cast or a dose of antibiotics. \"The staff on the ward are dealing with the very fundamental aspect of what makes a human a human, and that has given me a new-found respect for what they do, often in very challenging circumstances. \"To all the doctors, nursing staff and therapists at Moseley Hall who took me at rock bottom and, without judgement, worked tirelessly to help me to walk, talk and look after myself again, I owe a debt I will never be able to repay.\" Staff from the Learning Disability (LD) service attended the Faculty of Psychiatry of Intellectual Disability Annual Conference in Dublin to talk about using the intensive support team (IST) model as a new way of supporting patients with a learning disability. Dr Tonye Sikabofori, consultant psychiatrist for people with intellectual disabilities, and Meryl Crum, IST speech and language therapist, presented the service evaluation completed by the team. Dr Sikabofori said: \"Intensive support teams have been developed around the country to help support the 'transforming care' agenda, which is about identifying new ways of working to reduce preventable admissions to inpatient beds.\" The IST aims to reduce the risk of placement breakdown and preventable admission to inpatient units and support prompt discharges from inpatient health services where appropriate.

Named 'REX', the robotic lower-limb support can be used to lift patients from a sitting position into a supported standing position and allow them to take part in a set of supported walking and stretching exercises designed by therapists to help achieve rehabilitation goals. The evaluation, involving rehabilitation service occupational therapists, physiotherapists and patients, forms part of a programme of technology evaluations to explore the equipment's usability and potential bene ts. Specialist neuro physiotherapist Jeremy Newton said: \"REX was designed for patients with spinal injuries and we were asked to help assess the usability of the equipment for rehab patients, in particular people who have had a stroke, but also for people with other conditions that affect their movement. \"This evaluation has been a great chance for BCHC clinicians and patients to gain an insight into the potential for the use of exoskeletal equipment in rehabilitation and for their opinions to form part of that development work.\" Innovation manager Hamid Zolfagharinia said: A lot of planning and hard work has gone into this piece of work and the team at Moseley Hall has done a fantastic job of evaluating REX from the perspective of both staff and patients. The project was a collaboration with University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust's Healthcare Technology Co-operative (HTC), which arranged the rental of the equipment and 'back ll' cover for BCHC staff involved in the project. CREWS Staff demonstrating the equipment QR 99BCHC was successful in its bid to deliver a new early years health and wellbeing service for Birmingham, which went live in January. Named Birmingham Forward Steps, the new service brings together the citywide health visiting service and children's centres, creating local early years 'hubs' where families can access the help they need from pregnancy until their child starts school. Working in partnership with Barnardo's, Spurgeons, St Paul's Community Development Trust and the Spring eld Project, the service is designed to provide all families of pre-school children with accessible, community-based services in their own homes, GP surgeries, children's centres and a number of other community venues, with extra help available to those that need it. The Birmingham City Council-commissioned service will: support children to lead healthy lifestyles with advice on healthy diet and staying active ensure children develop well physically, emotionally and socially help keep children safe advise families on parenting and emotional wellbeing and offer extra family support when situations are challenging. support communities to develop accessible services that families really want by creating opportunities to listen to local people and develop new services together. The views of parents, carers and professionals have played a crucial part in designing the service through public and staff consultations. Nursing and therapies director Gareth Howells said: \"We were very pleased to continue providing a universal service to all pre-school children in the city, supporting all aspects of health and wellbeing for the child and their family. \"Our aim is to ensure that all of Birmingham's children are healthy, happy and well prepared to start school, helping to ful l Birmingham City Council's vision 'to give every child in Birmingham an equal chance to have the best start in life so they can achieve their full potential'.\" Section 4 CREWSBCHC to deliver new early years partnership A research project at Birmingham Dental Hospital and School of Dentistry explored the use of video glasses as a means of managing anxiety experienced by children and young people undergoing dental treatment. Patients whose anxiety had made treatment dif cult were offered the use of the video glasses as an alternative to local or general anaesthetic. Three quarters of parents and children who completed a patient satisfaction survey said the glasses made it easier for their treatment to be carried out and that they would choose to wear them again when receiving dental care. Student dentist Paras Haria, who was part of the research team, said: \"Video glasses have proved to be a safe, patient-friendly method of not only improving a child's dental experience and long-term care but also in enabling delivery of treatment.\"Video glasses research Have never seen the goggles at the dentist.

Local councillor and partner governor Josh Jones was guest of honour as colleagues celebrated the of cial opening of an \u00a380,000 renovation and extension that saw the creation of three new clinical rooms and a more welcoming, open plan reception at the Jaffray Resource Centre in Erdington. As base for the north Birmingham team and a public venue where service users attend clinics, the aim was to enhance facilities for both public and staff. The project refl ects the growth of the service and an ongoing commitment to meet clients' needs. At the Green eld Centre in King's Norton, a therapy suite was created in an area previously used as an inpatient assessment and treatment unit. The modi cations, which were made with a \u00a3193,000 investment, delivered extra clinical space accessible to all patients, carers and staff across the LD service.Local MP Steve of cially opened the new suite, which sees many clinics delivered from a dedicated LD site rather than multi-purpose venues across the city, increasing access and frequency. The new suite increases access to a range of clinics, including: a specialised seating clinic which will be delivered by LD physiotherapists in conjunction with the Birmingham Wheelchair Service. regular weight check clinics delivered by dieticians. a dedicated environment to deliver massage therapy. additional rooms for group work and talking therapies. monthly clinics for patients requiring frequent blood tests. Honour for dental hospital design Birmingham Dental Hospital and School of Dentistry won the 'design through innovation' category in the prestigious Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors regional awards. Judges said: \"Functionality and layout has been enhanced through clever design and colour from the welcoming environment created by a huge link atrium, through to the naturally lit, open plan dental bays and the world class research laboratories whilst overall achieving the highest sustainability standards.\" The \u00a350m development, opened in March 2016, was also shortlisted in the 'architecture and the built environment' and 'infrastructure' categories.

BCHC advanced physiotherapist Jonathan Price led the study for the Trust, with the support of the research and innovation (R&I) team. Jonathan said: \"The aim was to look at the best ways of treating a particular shoulder problem so that we can improve our clinical practice and, in turn, the care we give our patients.\" Jonathan said: \"Initially the team ensured that the plans for the study were designed to t around the day-to-day working of the musculoskeletal service. \"They continued to support me with advice, support and troubleshooting. In addition, the team supported my application for the Clinical Academic Internship Programme, funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) - the rst step in becoming a clinical academic. \"Completing this will support future applications for NIHR-funded Masters and PhD programmes. Upon achieving a PhD I can then start working as a clinical academic.\" \"Research is an important part of clinical practice, and we want to encourage more clinicians to get involved. We have close links with local universities and also want to train more of our clinicians to conduct research so that we can undertake our own studies.\" Section 4 CREWS QR 102A new unit specially designed for people being cared for at the end of their life was opened at West Heath Hospital. The new Sheldon Unit was of cially opened in a fully refurbished 20-bed ward by Birmingham Lord Mayor Councillor Anne Underwood. The Sheldon team had provided end of life and respite care at the unit's previous location in North eld for 24 years. Clinical team leader Judith Russell said: We were honoured to welcome Councillor Underwood to our new unit, which was designed to be light, airy and offer calm and comfort to both patients and their families at a dif cult time. \"We always have worked hard to maintain a high standard of care for all our patients in this unit - now we have a high quality unit to match.\" At the opening, Councillor Underwood spoke about her own experience of end of life care. She said: \"When my husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer, I had to ght to get him discharged to a private facility so he would have daily care of highest quality for his remaining days. \"So, it gives me great pleasure to open an NHS unit that takes pride in providing individualised, digni ed care to people reaching the end of their life.

Trust representatives were among NHS employers from all over England who welcomed His Royal Highness The Duke of Cambridge to the offi cial launch of the Step Into Health initiative to support recruitment from the Armed Forces community. Developed by Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, alongside Walking with the Wounded and the Duke's charity, the Royal Foundation, the programme is designed to help NHS organisations recruit veterans and reap the benefi ts of skills and experience gained during military service. The event was attended by 30 NHS organisations who are the fi rst to pledge their support for the initiative following a successful pilot phase. BCHC was represented by armed forces healthcare programme manager Scott Thornton and senior HR business partner Jonathan Cassidy at the Step Into Health launch. Scott said: \"We are very proud to support this new national programme, which is clear evidence of our continuing support for the Armed Forces community. \"Veterans bring a very wide range of skills, experience and leadership ability developed in the Armed Forces to the workplace. Jonathan added: \"Our vision is to be an employer that is inclusive of all talents, backgrounds and experiences from all the communities we serve. \"The Duke talked about shared values and it is those values that are embedded in our recruitment and retention agenda and bring signifi cant benefi ts when it comes to recruiting to areas where there are hard-to-fi ll vacancies and a shortage of skills in particular specialities.\" Section 4 CREWS QR 104Let the games begin!

Therapy assistant Craig Cattell said: Group activities help stimulate patients both physically and mentally - as well as being fun these activities have a real therapeutic value.\"Dementia nurse boxes clever Dementia patients on ward 6 gained a special repository for precious memories thanks to an idea funded by BCHC Charity. Patients on the ward are presented with a 'memory box' to hold personal items such as photos, books and trinkets. The boxes, decorated by University of Birmingham student volunteers, were the idea of ward 6 nurse Anna O'Neill, who said: \"Having a place for patients to keep things that are important to them can help reduce anxiety, especially when they're in the unfamiliar setting of a hospital ward. \"We can encourage patients to look at the items when we see they are becoming distressed.\" BCHC Charity Family gardening Thanks to charity supporters 'digging deep', BCHC patients were able to help make a difference to the gardens at Moseley Hall Hospital. With the support of the BCHC Charity, rehabilitation service users helped get the hospital gardens ready for summer. A range of plants, flowers and tools were supplied so that ward 9 service users, families and staff could enjoy a day of planting, weeding and watering. The charity also funded a new set of furniture for the neighbouring Moor Green outpatient unit garden. Occupational therapy technical instructor Alastair Gordon said:\"The garden 'tidy-up' helped bring this under-used space back to life and create a place people want to be. \"It also provided an opportunity for patients to share knowledge and skills, which is very important for self-esteem, as patients often feel incapacitated.\" QR 105Mini-makeover for special school meeting room A doctor's consultation room in need of modernisation at a Birmingham special school was transformed into a warm and welcoming private space for pupils, parents and nursing staff to meet thanks to a multi-coloured charity makeover.

It is a tool to enable a quality assessment of NHS library/knowledge services. The LQAF is designed so that an organisation can assess its level of compliance to national standards and demonstrate the tness for purpose. There are ve domains with a number of criteria to assess the service against. Services can claim to either be fully compliant, partially compliant, non-compliant or not applicable. It provides a clear focus for action planning across all NHS organisations, driving forward a quality improvement plan, offering clarity of direction for service managers and transparency of development to meet business and client need. Assessment against the criteria of the standards within the LQAF enables each library/ knowledge service to identify any gaps in their service management and provision so that these requirements can be built into their business and service planning. Once again, Smallwood Library submitted its annual return for the Library Quality Assurance Framework in 2017.

The Director of Nursing and Therapies ensured through the Clinical Quality Assurance Programme Manager that BCHC's main stakeholders were given the opportunity to comment and provide an objective view around the content of this Quality Report and the goals it set itself for improvement for the coming year. External influence has included the Council of Governors, Healthwatch and our Commissioners in order to ensure that the Quality Report presents a balanced view of the quality of care delivered by BCHC. The Trust has shared a draft Quality Report 2017-18 with our commissioners through NHS Birmingham and Solihull Clinical Commissioning Group (co-ordinating commissioner), Healthwatch Birmingham and Birmingham Health & Social Care Overview and Scrutiny Committee. Their responses can be found in Annex 1. All of the comments have been considered and changes have been made where appropriate. Consultation with staff has taken place through BCHC committee structures and staff forums that has included open access 'page turning' sessions whereby attendees were given the space and time to talk through and comment on the content of the Quality Report. The whole process has been overseen by the Quality Report Editorial Group whose membership includes the Chair of Patient Experience Forum and a patient representative/Governor. Progress has been reported to a number of executive led committees before its nal approval.External assurance on the was gained through external auditors who have reviewed the content of the quality report against the requirements of NHS Improvements published guidance 2017-18.

We are pleased to see that the Trust has taken on board some of our comments regarding the previous Quality Account. For example, the Trust has: Given some examples of patient experience and feedback, and how these are used to develop solutions that improve the quality of services. Demonstrated how the Trust learns from safety incidents and actions taken based on these lessons. Aggregated data to show the response rate, and the positive responders that would recommend the Trust. Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) It is positive to see that the Trust continues to engage patients, members of the public, staff, other NHS and local authority partners to develop the Trust's quality priorities. We note that the Trust consulted and engaged with stakeholders between November 2017 and March 2018 using varied methods including online surveys, discussion forums and meetings. In our response to the 2016-17 Quality Accounts, we asked the Trust to give examples of how patient feedback and experiences have led to particular changes or improvements to services. We are pleased to read about the initiatives that the Trust has implemented over the year. Firstly, the work with patients, carers and their families to improve harm free care. We note the production of two lms on falls that are being used as educational tools. We are pleased to see that these lms are based on service user experiences following a fall, and their insight as to the factors to be considered pre and post fall. Secondly, the goal to hear the voice of the child/young person in shaping how services are delivered. It is positive to read about how the Trust has involved young people, their carer's and parents in developing plans. For example, listening to young people's experiences and insights on their expectations of health respite services, branding of a new service by the early years team, and on the Birmingham Special Schools Nurses Service. Thirdly, the goal to improve engagement and consultation with patients, carers and the public for any changes to how and where services are delivered. We acknowledge the involvement of patients, carers and the public in the production of information, through the Estates Strategy plans, that support patients to move from Sheldon Unit to the West Heath Hospital site. In addition, we note that patients at Moseley Hospital have been asked to comment on changes to the district nurse contract, new patient leaflets on district nurses and cleanliness and food provision. We note the changes made in response. We look forward to reading more about the impact of feedback, and we would like to read how the Trust communicates with patients about how they are using their feedback to make changes. At Healthwatch Birmingham, we believe that demonstrating to patients QR 111Section 5 how their feedback is used to make changes or improvements shows service users and the public that they are valued in the decision-making process. Consequently, this has the potential to increase feedback. We welcome the 'you said, together we did' approach for staff engagement. We believe that a similar approach for patients would encourage them to provide feedback as they will know that their views matter and lead to actual changes/ improvement to services. In our response to the Trust's 2016-17 Quality Accounts, we welcomed plans to review assessment processes. We indicated that, for the assessment process and care planning to be effective, service users and carers have to be involved. For the 2017-18 Quality Accounts, The Trust has presented evidence of the successes in care planning and assessment. We are pleased with the training that staff have received on care planning in various services and that services, such as Urgent care/INRU have had an improvement of 95.1 per cent. However, it is not clear in the Quality Account how service users, carers and families are involved in this process. We would like to read in the 2018-19 Quality Accounts how service users, carers and patients are involved in the care planning and assessment process. Regarding the Friends and Family (FFT) Scores, in our response to the 2016-17 Quality Accounts, we asked the Trust to aggregate data to show the response rate and positive responders that would recommend the Trust. We are happy to see that the 2017-18 Quality Account shows how the Trust has performed over the year, and the number of those that are likely or not likely to recommend the Trust to family and friends. We also note that the Trust encourages patients to give qualitative feedback in the survey. Qualitative feedback helps the Trust better understand the reasons for a particular score. We look forward to reading in the 2018-19 Quality Account how the FFT scores have been used to make changes or improve services and practice. Staff and PPI We note that the percentage of staff responding to the staff survey remains at 40%, which is below the national average of 50 per cent. However, we acknowledge that in real numbers the response rate has increased. In 2016 the Trust sent the survey to 1250 staff and had a return rate of 490, whereas this year 4713 staff members received the survey and 1868 responded. We note that the staff survey indicates improvement in several areas, such as the 'effective use of patient feedback'. In particular, there has been signicant improvement in the 'communication of patient feedback to staff delivering care. We note that 64% of staff say they receive regular updates on patient/service user experience and feedback via line managers or communication teams. Similarly, 54% of staff say that feedback from patients/service users is used to make informed decisions within their department/directorate. We would like to see examples of how staff use this feedback to effect change in the 2018-19 Quality Account. We welcome the priorities for action that the Trust has put in place in relation to staff. We hope to read on an improvement in these in the 2018-19 Quality Account. In particular: action two on equality and diversity; action three on errors and incidents; and action three on patient care and experience. We are pleased that the focus for action three will be on the percentage of staff who feel their role makes a difference to patients and service users. We believe that the basic approach of Healthwatch Birmingham's Quality Standard for PPI will help the Trust develop this further. The Quality Standard has a set of questions relating to staff and PPI, which ascertain the following: Whether there is a clear strategic approach for PPI that staff understand across the Trust? Do staff understand what their responsibilities are in relation to PPI? Do they have set objectives for PPI that are regularly monitored? Do they understand how PPI informs decision-making in their service area to make improvement and address inequality? and, Do they understand that improvements or changes made as a result of feedback should be shared with patients and the public? QR 112As we suggested in the 2016-17 response to the Trust's Quality Accounts, we believe that the Trust could benet from developing a strategy that clearly outlines how and why patients, the public and carers will be engaged in order to improve health outcomes and reduce health inequality. A strategy will ensure that there is commitment across the Trust to using patient and public insight, experience and involvement. It will also make clear arrangements for collating feedback and experience. Patient Outcomes In our response to the Trust's 2016-17 Quality Accounts, we asked the Trust to consider aggregating clinical outcomes according to different patient groups or characteristics. This will enable the Trust to establish barriers different groups face when accessing clinical services and address these appropriately. We note that a majority of services are still recording clinical outcome results on paper. Consequently, it is difcult to collate results at service level and difcult for clinicians to review data and act accordingly. We would like to read in the 2018-19 Quality Accounts considerable improvements in the number of services using electronic recording, reviews by clinicians of this data and improvements or changes made as a result. We note the use of a smart survey to increase patient responses following a treatment (e.g. dental oral surgery - patient reported outcome). We welcome that this is going to be recommended to other services seeking similar responses. We also note that a draft clinical outcomes framework has been developed to support services who wish to develop outcomes in the future to support existing delivery. We would like to read about the impact of these in the 2018-19 Quality Accounts Demonstrating Learning In our response to the Trust's 2016-17 Quality Accounts, we asked to see examples of how the Trust learns from reviews, patient safety incidents (including death) and complaints. It is positive to see examples of how the Trust is learning, in particular from deaths and the key issues identied for action. For example, the ndings that care planning is not patient-centred, sepsis tools are not routinely used and diagnostic tests not always completed during admission. We welcome the actions instituted to address these ndings. We would like to read more about the impact of the care planning and the documentation quality improvement project in the 2018-19 Quality Account and the patient and bereavement work stream plan. We would also like to read more about learning from the increasing incidents relating to admissions, transfer, discharge, and access to service following contract review. We were particularly interested to read about the involvement and engagement of services users, carers and families in care planning and developing end of life plans. We would like to know how the Trust will put into action NHS England's guidance on 'learning from death'. Especially, how the Trust listens to families and carers; informs them of their rights and how they can access support or advocacy; and involves them in various stages of case reviews and investigations. In addition, how the Trust weights families and patients views, compared with how they weight the views of clinical staff. We note that for the 2016-17 period, the Trust had two never events at Birmingham Dental Hospital. These were both wrong site surgery relating to anaesthesia administered on wrong site prior to a scheduled tooth extraction. We are concerned that the same thing happened twice (October, 2017 and January, 2018), and wonder about the timings of reviews following an incident and sharing of lessons. We would like to read in the 2018-19 Quality Account how soon reviews into incidents are carried out, and the lessons/actions shared within a service and across the Trust. QR 113The Trusts Priorities for 2018-19 Healthwatch Birmingham has taken note of the Trust's priorities for 2018-2019. We believe that a continued focus on patient experience, patient safety, and clinical effectiveness are important. In particular, engaging patients in service design (e.g. develop and implement the plans for engagement and co-design projects for the year); embedding learning from clinical complaints; bereavement support and end of life care; and support for children and families (e.g. develop methodology for listening to feedback from bereaved relatives; develop methodology and approach for increasing feedback; develop staff pack to share with bereaved relatives); and working with individuals, patients, carers and families to improve harm free care. To conclude, Healthwatch Birmingham would like to commend the Trust for taking action in response to some of our comments on the 2016-17 Quality Accounts. It is positive to see examples of learning from death and actions taken in response. However, the Trust has not clearly demonstrated in the Quality Accounts how it uses feedback to understand and address issues of health inequality. As well as how it communicates with services users and the public on how their feedback has been used and the changes made. It is our wish that there will be further improvements in these area in the 2018-19 Quality Account. As per our role, Healthwatch Birmingham is running various projects to support providers in Birmingham to meet their statutory role of consulting/engaging with patients and the public. Consequently, ensuring that Trusts are using public and patient feedback to inform changes to services, improve the quality of services and understand inequality in access to services and health outcomes. We have worked with some Trusts to review their patient and public involvement process (PPI), identify areas of good PPI practice and recommend how PPI practice can be made more effective. We would welcome the opportunity to explore how we can support the Trust to improve in the year ahead. \"Health and Social Care Overview and Scrutiny Committee will not be in a position to comment on the draft BCHC 2017/18 Quality Report\". 22nd Feb 2018 Section 5 QR 114Statement for Quality Account 2017-18 Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust Birmingham & Solihull Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), as coordinating commissioner for Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust (BCHC), welcomes the opportunity to provide this statement for inclusion in the trusts 2017-18 Quality Account. A draft copy of the Quality Account was received by the CCG on the 19th April 2018 and the statement has been developed from the information presented to date in accordance with Department of Health guidance. The draft account has been shared across the CCG and NHS West Midlands to provide an opportunity to comment. The information provided within this account presents a balanced report of the healthcare services that BCHC provides. There are some gaps in the account relating to numbers of Venous thromboembolism (VTE) and incomplete pathways that will need to be populated in the nal document, however the range of services described and priorities for improvement are representative based on the information that is available to us. The report demonstrates the progress made within the Trust. It identies what the organisation has done well, where further improvement is required and what actions are needed to achieve these goals and the priorities set for 2018-19. The CCG recognises that the Trust has consulted widely and worked with patients, members of the public, staff and other NHS and local authority partner stakeholders to determine the focus of the quality priorities for the coming year. These are clinically driven and support the three quality domains of Patient Safety, Clinical Effectiveness and Patient Experience. We acknowledge that the priorities have evolved over time and that the emphasis is on continual sustainable improvement through clinical engagement and leadership. The account demonstrates achievement against the majority of the 2016-17 priorities and work undertaken to ensure quality improvement initiatives are embedded in practice. The Trust continues to work with patients, carers and their families to improve harm free care supported by the Safety Express programme, and a positive and a transparent safety culture is delivered through Patient Safety Ambassadors. Falls prevention is a key priority for the Trust who exceeded their internal target for falls resulting in severe injury or death during 2017-18. The CCG welcomes the on-going focus on further development of the extensive falls prevention work programme that includes the production of two falls lms to be used as educational packages. Patient experience has been sought to develop an understanding of the factors to be considered pre and post fall. There is a positive work programme across the Divisions to ensure the effective use of systems and rostering tools to provide assurance on safe nurse stafng levels. It is pleasing to note the development and implementation of the electronic management system to support safe stafng analysis in district nursing teams, and the bespoke clinical training and competency framework to support skills development of nursing staff in Urgent Care services. Patient Experience is embedded throughout the document and it is clear that this is important to the organisation. The CCG is pleased to note the progress made in relation to public engagement. The views of children and young people are incorporated into service delivery initiatives, and patients, carers and the public are consulted on plans for service development. School ambassadors and the Early Years Services Partnership have been actively engaged in holding events throughout the year. Plans to develop a Lessons Learnt group are positive, and demonstrate the Trust's commitment to embedding learning from clinical complaints. The Trust continues to encourage incident reporting and implement initiatives to ensure that quality of services remains high and that learning from incidents is embedded. The ethos of continuous improvement is also captured in the planned schedule of work relating to the development and monitoring of patient outcome measures. QR 115The Trust reports that there is further work to do to achieve its aims of introducing information technology to improve patient care and has plans to improve and develop network connectivity, cyber security and the core telephony platform during 2018-19. Over 5000 appointment reminders are currently sent to patients every 48 hours, as a result Adult & Community and Dental services report a reduction of 4.5% missed appointments. There has been signicant progress with development of care planning and assessment to ensure that these are person centred and focus on a holistic approach. Care plan completion is continually monitored through Essential Care Indicators across all areas. Care planning training and clinical supervision sessions are available for staff. It is pleasing to note the planned introduction of a clinical record keeping group to drive further improvements in clinical records, root cause analysis and Essential Care Indicators documentation. There is a comprehensive section on trust engagement with national clinical audits and condential enquiries. A review of local clinical audits throughout the year has generated some key actions the Trust plan to take during 2018-19 to improve the quality of healthcare provision. These include improving the quality of the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool documentation and embedding the VTE risk assessment process across intermediate care. The CCG welcome and support the recommendations made for improvement of VTE assessment which are clearly identied and focus on initial assessment, review of risk assessment, clear documentation and sharing of best practice. Quality priorities for action in 2018-19 reflect areas where improvement is required and we will continue to work with the Trust to support achievement of these goals. The CCG is supportive of the plans to improve the uptake and quality of staff appraisals, increasing the percentage of staff reporting errors, near misses or incidents and undertaking a staff cultural temperature check to facilitate on-going staff engagement in the improvement of patient care and experience. The Trust recognises that whilst improvements in response rates to the 2017 staff survey have been achieved, they remain below the national average for community trusts. Plans for 2018 have been made to take a targeted approach at divisional and corporate service level to promote the importance and value of completing the staff survey. There has been an increase in the number of patient safety incidents reported during 2017-18 resulting in severe harm or death. The trust has stated that this is related to the introduction of reporting unstageable pressure ulcers, and the development of the mortality review process which has been extended to include all patient deaths notied to or noted by BCHC. The CCG will continue to work with the trust to support on-going review of these areas over the coming year. We have made some specic comments to the Trust in relation to their report which we hope will be considered as part of the nal document. These include points regarding accuracy of data, use of abbreviations without explanation of full meaning and inclusion of outcomes to demonstrate utilisation of patient feedback. Through this Quality Account and the on-going quality assurance process, BCHC have demonstrated their commitment to continually improve the quality of services provided. As commissioners, we look forward to continuing to work in partnership with the Trust during 2018-19 and supporting them to deliver these quality priorities.
