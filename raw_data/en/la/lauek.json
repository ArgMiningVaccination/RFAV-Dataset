Based on clinical response, the dose can be increased to 300 mg. Each 300 mg dose is given as one subcutaneous injection of 300mg or as two subcutaneous injections of 150 mg. For all the above indications, available data suggest that a clinical response i s usually achieved within 16 weeks of treatment. Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response by 16 weeks of treatment. Some patients with an initial partial response may subsequently improve with continue d treatment beyond 16 weeks. Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr -axSpA) The recommended dose is 150 mg by subcutaneous injection with initial dosing at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by monthly maintenance dosing. Special popu lations Renal impairment / hepatic cally in these patient popu lations. Pediatric patients Safety and effectiveness of pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis below the age of 6 years have not been established. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 18 years in other indications have not yet been establishe d. Geriatric patients (65 years or above) No dose adjustment is r equired. Method of admini stration Powder for solution for injection tyx is administered by subcutaneous injection. Cosen tyx powde r for solution must be reconsti tuted before use. Full instructions for use are provided in section PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION . Pre-filled syringe & pr e-filled pe 5 of 71 Cosen tyx is administered by subcutaneous injection. If possible, areas of the skin that show psori asis should be avoided a s injection sites. After proper training in subcutaneous injection technique, patients may self-inject Cosen tyx or be injected by a caregiver if a ph ysician determines that it is appropriate. However, the physician should e nsure approp riate follo w-up of patients. Patients and/or caregivers shoul d be ins tructed to inject the full amount of Cosent yx acc ording to the ins tructions provide d the pa ckage le aflet. Compr ehensive ins tructions for administration are given in the p ackage leaflet. For patients receiving the 75 mg dose, the 75 mg/0.5 mL pre -filled syringe should be used. Full instructions for u se are provided in section PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION . CONTRAINDIC ATIONS Severe hypersensitivity reactions to the active substance or to any of the excipients (see sections DES CRIPTION AND COMPOS ITION, WARN PRECAUT UTIONS Infections Cosen tyx has the po tential to increase the risk of infections. In clinical studies, inf ections ha ve been observed in patients receiving Cosent yx (see section ADVERS E DRUG REAC TIONS). Most of these were mild or mode rate upper respiratory tract infections such as nasopharyngitis and did not require treatment discontinuation. Caution should be exercised when conside ring the use of Cosen tyx in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection. Patients should be instructed to seek medi cal advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. If a patient develops a serious infection, the pa tient should be closely moni tored and Cos entyx should not be administered unt il the infection resolves. Cosentyx Dec 2021.SIN Page 6 of 71 No increased susceptibility to tuberculosis was reported from clinical studi es. However, Cosen tyx should not be given to patients with active tuberculosis. Anti-tuberculosis therapy should be consid ered prior to initiation of Cosent yx in patients with late nt tuberculosis. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Caution should be exercised, when prescribing Cosen tyx to patients with inflammatory bowel disease (e.g. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) as exacerbations of IBD, in some cases serious, were observed in clinical stud ies in both Cosen tyx and placebo groups. In addition, cases of new onset IBD have been reported with post -marketing use . Patients who are treated with Cosen tyx and ha ve IBD should be followed closely. Hypersensi tivity reactions In clinical studies, rare cases of anaphylactic reactions have been observed in patients receiving Cosentyx. I f an anaphylactic or ot her serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Cosen tyx shou ld be discontinue d immedi ately and approp riate therapy initiated. Latex-sensitive individuals - 1 mL pr e-filled-syringe/pen and 0.5 mL pre- filled syringe The r emovable caps of the Cosen tyx 1 mL pre-filled syringe/pen, and 0.5 mL pre -filled syringe, contain a derivative of natural rubbe r latex. Althou gh no natural rubbe r latex is detected in the cap, the safe use of Cosen tyx pre -filled s yringe/pen in has not been studie d. Vaccinations Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with Cosen tyx (see also section INTERAC TIONS). Patients may receive concurrent inactivated non-live vaccinations. In stu dy, after meningococcal (polysaccharide) and inactivated influenza vaccinations, a similar proportion of healthy subjects treated with a single dose of Cosen tyx 150 mg and healthy subj ects in the control group (no Cosen tyx treatment) were able to mount an adequate immune response of at least a 4-fold increase in antibody titers to meningococ cal and influenza vaccines. The data sugge st that Cosent yx does not suppr ess the humor al immune r esponse to the m eningo coccal or influenza va ccines. Cosentyx Dec 2021.SIN Page 7 of 71 Prior to initiating therapy with Cosentyx, it is recommended that pediatric patients receive all age-appropriate immunizations as per current immunization guidelines. ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS Summ ary of the safety profile Over 18,000 patients have been treated with Cosen tyx in blinded and open-label clinical studi es in various indications (plaque psoriasis and other autoimmune conditions) , representing 30,565 patient years of exposure. Of these, over 11,500 pa tients were exposed to Cosen tyx for at least one year. Adverse reactions in plaque psoriasis Adult patients Four placebo-control led phase III studi es in plaque psori asis were pooled to evaluate the s afety of Cosen tyx in compa rison to placebo up to 12 weeks after treatment initiation. In total, 2,076 patients were evaluated (692 patients on 150 mg, 690 patients on 300 mg and 694 patients on placebo). The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were uppe r respiratory tract infections (most frequently na soph aryngitis, rhinitis). Most of the events were mild or mode rate in s everity. In the placebo-controll ed period of plaque psoriasis phase III studies the proportion of patients who discontinue d treatment due to adverse events was approximately 1.2 % in the Cosen tyx arm and 1.2% in the pl acebo arm. ADRs from psoriasis clinical studies (Table 2) are listed by MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ class, the ADRs are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions fi rst. Within each frequency grouping , adverse drug reactions are presented in order of decr easing seriousn ess. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug reaction is based on the followin g conve ntion (CIOMS III): (1/1,00 0 to rare <1/1,000); v ery rare (<1/10,000).

Frequency determined based on placebo -controlled clinical studies (phase III) in plaque psoriasis patients Pediatric patients The safety of Cosentyx was assessed in two phase III studies in pediatric patients with plaque psoriasis. The first was a double -blind, placebo- controlled study of 162 patients from 6 to less than 18 years of age with severe plaque psoriasis. The second is an open- label study of 84 patients from 6 to less th an 18 years of age with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The safety profile reported in thes e studies was consistent with the safety profile reported in adult plaque psoriasis patients. Adverse drug reactions from spontaneous reports and literature cases (frequency not known) The follow ing adverse drug reactions have been derived from post -marketing experience with Cosentyx via spontaneous case reports and literature cases. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency which is therefore categorized as not known. Adverse drug reactions are listed according to system organ classes in MedDRA. Within each system organ class, ADRs are presented in or der of decreasing seriousness. Table 3 Adverse drug reactions from spontaneous reports and literature (frequency not known) Infections and infestations Mucosal and cutaneous candidiasis Description of selected adverse drug reactions Adult patients Infections In the placebo-controll ed period of clinical studies in plaque psoriasis (a total of 1,382 patients treated with Cosen tyx and 694 patients treated with placebo for up to 12 weeks), infections were reported in 28.7% of patients tre ated with Cosen tyx compa red with 18.9% of patients treated with placebo. Most of these were mild or mode rate. Serious infections occur red in 0.14% of patients treated with Cosentyx and in 0.3% of patients treated wit h pla cebo (see section WARNINGS AND PRECAU TIONS). Cosentyx Dec 2021.SIN Page 10 of 71 Over the entire treatment period (a total of 3,430 patients treated with Cosen tyx for up to 52 weeks for the majority of patients), infections were reported in 47.5% of patients treated with Cosen tyx (0.9 pe r patient-year of follo w-up). Serious infections were reported in 1.2% of patients treated w ith Co sentyx (0.01 5 per patient-year of follo w-up). Infection rates observed were similar to what was observed in the psoriasis studies. Hypersensi tivity reactions In clinical studies, ur ticaria and rare cases of anaphylactic reactions to Cosent yx were observed. clinical studies, l ess than 1% of patients treated with Cosen tyx developed antibodies to secukinum ab up to 52 w eeks of treatment. About half of the treatment emergent anti-drug ant ibodies were neutralizing, but t his w as not assoc iated with l oss of efficacy or PK a bnormalities. Adverse reactions in psoriatic arthritis Cosentyx was studied in five placebo -controlled psoriatic arthritis trials with 2,754 patients (1,871 patients on Cosentyx and 883 patients on placebo) with a total exposure of 4,478 patient years of study exposure on Cosentyx. The safety profile observed in patients with psoriatic arthritis treated with Cosentyx is consistent with the safety profile in psoriasis. Adverse reactions in axial trials with 816 patients ( 544 patients on Cosentyx and 272 patients on placebo). The median duration of exposure for secukinumab- treated patients was 469 days in AS 1 Study, 460 days in AS 2 Study, and 1,142 days in AS 3 Study. Cosentyx was also studied in one placebo -controlled non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis trial with 555 patients (369 patients on Cosentyx and 186 patients on placebo) for a total of 588 patient -years of study exposure (median duration of exposure for sec ukinumab- treated patients: 395 days).

INTERA CTIONS Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with Cosen tyx (see also section WARN INGS AND PRECAUT IONS). In a study in adult subjects with plaque psoriasis, no interaction was observed between secukinumab and midazolam (CYP 3A4 substrate). Cosen tyx administered with m ethotrexate (MTX) and/or corticosteroids in arthritis studies (including axial spondyloarthritis ) where no inte raction w as seen. PREGNANCY, LACTATION, FEMALES AND MALES OF REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL Pregnanc y Risk Summary There are no adequate data from the use of Cosentyx in pregnant wom en. Animal studies do not indicate di rect or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonic/fetal developm ent, parturition or postna tal developme nt. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human respons e, Cosen tyx should be used during pregnancy onl y if the benefits clearly outweigh the potent ial risks. Animal Data In an embryofetal development study in cynomolgus monkeys, secukinumab showed no maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity when administered throughout organogenesis and late gestation. No undesirable effects of an anti -murine IL -17A antibody were seen in a pre -and postnatal development study in mice. The high dose used in this study was in excess of the maximally effective dose in terms of IL -17A suppression and activity. Cosentyx Dec 2021.SIN Page 12 of 71 Lactation It is not known w hether secukinum ab is excreted in human m ilk. Because immunog lobulins are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Cosen tyx is administered to a wom an who is br east-feeding. Females and males of reproductive potential Infertility There are no special recommendations for females of reproductive potential. The effect of Cosentyx on human fertility has not been evaluated. No undesirable effects of an anti -murine IL -17A antibody were seen in fertility and earl y embryonic development studies in mice. The high dose used in the study was in excess of the maximally effective dose in terms of IL -17A suppression and activity. OVERDO SAGE No cas es of ove rdose have been reported in clinical studies. Doses up to 30 mg/kg (i.e. approx imately 2,000 to 3,000 mg) have been administered intravenous ly in clinical studi es without dose-limiting toxicity. In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and approp riate symptomatic t reatment be instituted im mediately. CLINICAL PHA RMACOLOGY Pharmacotherapeutic group, ATC Interleukin inhibitors; ATC code L04AC10. Mechanis m of action (MOA) Secukinum ab is a fully human IgG1 antibody that selectively binds to and neutralizes the proinfl ammatory cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A). Secukinum ab works by targeting IL-17A and inhibiting its interaction with the IL-17 receptor, which is expressed on various cell types includi ng keratinocytes and synoviocytes . As a release of proinfl ammatory cytokines, chemokines and mediato rs of tissue damage and reduces IL-17A-medi ated contributions to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Cosentyx Dec 2021.SIN Page 13 of 71 Clinically relevant levels of secukinum ab reach the skin and reduce local inflammatory markers. As a direct consequence treatment with secukinu mab reduces erythema, indur ation, and desquamation pre sent plaque psoriasis lesions. IL-17A is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in norm al inflammato ry and immune responses. IL-17A plays a key role in the pathogenesis of plaque lymphoc ytes and innate immune cells and increased levels of IL-17A ha ve be en found in the blood of patients with plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis and affected skin of asis. IL-17A is hi ghly up-regulated in lesion al skin in contrast to non-lesion al skin of plaque psori asis p atients. Furthermore higher frequency of IL -17-producing cells was detected in the synovial fluid of patients with psoriatic arthritis. The frequency of IL -17 producing cells was also significantly higher in the subchondral bone marrow of facet joints from patien ts with axial spondyloarthritis . Inhibition of IL -17A was shown to be effective in the treatment of AS, thus establishing the key role of this cytokine in axial spondyloarthritis (see section Clinical studies) IL-17A also promot es tissue in flammation, neut rophil infiltration, bone and tissue d estruction, ng including b-bound IL-17A) are to reduced clearance of secukinum ab-bound IL-17A within 2 to 7 days in patients receiving secukinum ab, indicating that secukinum ab selectively captu res free IL-17A which plays a key role in the pathogenesis of plaque psori asis. In a study epidermal neutrophils various neutrophil associ ated markers reased in lesional skin of plaque psori asis patients were significantly reduced after one to two we eks of treatment. Secukinumab has been shown to lower (within 1 to 2 weeks of treatment) levels of C -reactive protein, which is a marker of inflammation in psoriatic of 71 Absorption Following a single subcutaneous dose of either 150 mg, or 300 mg administered as two injections of 150 mg in plaqu e psori asis patients, s ecukinum ab reached peak serum concentrations of 13.7 \u00b1 4.8 microgram/ mL or 27.3 \u00b1 9.5 microgram/ mL, respectively, between 5 and 6 da ys post dose. After the initial weekly dosing during the first month, the t ime to reach the maximum concent ration w as between 31 a nd 34 da ys. Peak concentr ations at steady-state (Cmax,ss) following sub cutaneous administration of 150 mg or 300 mg were 27.6 microgram/ mL and 55.2 microgram/ mL, respectively. Steady-state is reached after 20 w eeks with mont hly dosing regimens. Compa red with exposu re after a single dose, patients exhibited a 2-fold increase in peak serum c oncentrations a is abso rbed a absolute bio availability of 73% . Following multiple subcutaneous doses of 300 mg administered via the 300 mg/2 mL pen in plaque psoriasis patients, the mean serum trough concentrations of secukinumab were consistent with those observed in the previous 150 mg/1 mL studies used to deliver 300 mg. Distribu tion The mean volum e of distribution dur ing the terminal phase (V z) followi ng a single intravenous administration ranged from 7.10 to 8.60 L in plaque psori asis, patients suggesting that secukinum ab unde concentr interstitial fluid in the skin of plaque psoriasis patients ranged from 28% to 39% of those in serum at 1 and 2 weeks after a single subcutane ous dose of 300 mg secukinu mab (administered as two injections of 150 mg). Elimination Mean systemic clearance (CL) was 0.19 L/d in plaque psor iasis patients. Clearance was dose- and endent, as expected for a therapeutic IgG1 mono clonal antibody interacting with a soluble cytokine target, such as IL-17A. The mean elimination half-life was estimated to be 27 days in plaque psori asis patients. Cosentyx Dec 2021.SIN Page 15 of 71 Estimated half-lives in indivi dual plaque psori asis patients range from 17 t o 41 da ys. Weight Secukinum ab clearance and volum e of distribution i ncrease as bod y weight increases. Dose linearity The single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of secukinu mab in plaque psori asis patients were determin ed in several studies with intravenous doses ranging from 1 x 0.3 mg/kg to 3 x 10 mg/kg and with subcutane ous doses ranging from 1 x 25 mg to multiple doses of 300 mg. E xposure was dose p roportional across all dosi ng regimens. The PK those displayed in plaque psoriasis patients. Special popu lations Elderly patients Of the 3,430 plaque psoriasis patients exposed to Cosen tyx in clinical studies, a total of 230 were 65 years of age or older and 32 pa tients w ere 75 years of age or older. Of the 2,536 psoriatic arthritis patients exposed to Cosentyx in clinical studies, a total of 236 patients were 65 years of age or older and 25 patients were 75 years of age or older. Of the 794 ankylosing spondylitis patients exposed to Cosentyx in clini cal studies, a total of 29 patients were 65 years of age or older and 3 patients were 75 years of age or older. Of the 524 non- radiographic axial spondyloarthritis patients exposed to Cosentyx in clinical studies, a total of 9 patients were 65 years of age or older and 2 patients were 75 years of age of older . Based on population PK analysis, clearance in elderly patients and patients less than 65 years of age was similar. Patients with renal and hepatic impairment No pha rmacokinetic da ta are available in pa tients with hepa tic or renal impai rment. Pediatric patients In a pool of the two pediatric studies, patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (6 to Cosentyx Dec 2021.SIN Page 16 of 71 less than 18 years of age) were administered secukinumab at the recommended pediatric dosing regimen. At Week 24, patients weighing 25 and <50 kg had a mean \u00b1 SD steady- state trough concentration of 19.8 \u00b1 6.96 microgram/mL (n=24) after 75 mg of secukinumab, and patients weighing 50 kg had a mean \u00b1 SD steady -state trough concentration of 27.3 \u00b1 10.1 microgram/mL (n=36) after 150 mg of secukinumab. The mean \u00b1 SD steady- state trough concentration in patients weighing <25 kg (n=8) was 32.6 \u00b1 10.8 microgram/mL at Week 24 after 75 mg dose. CLINICAL STUDIES Psoriasis Adult patients The safety and efficacy of Cos entyx were assesse d in four random ized, dou ble-blind, pla cebo - controll ed phase 3 studies in patients with moderate to severe plaq ue psoriasis who were candidat es for photo therapy or systemic therapy [ERAS URE, FIXTURE, FEATURE, JUNCTURE ]. The efficacy and safety of Cos entyx 150 mg and 300 m g were evaluated versus either placebo or etanercept. In addition, one study assesse d a chronic treatment regimen versus a 'retreatment as n eeded' regimen [SCULPTURE ]. In these studies, each 300 mg dose was given as two subcutaneous injections of 150 mg. Of the 2,403 patients who were included in the placebo -controll ed studies, 37% were systemic na\u00efve, 79% anti-TNF failures, and 2% were anti-p40 failures. Baseline disease characteristics were generally consistent across all treatment groups with a medi an baseline Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score from 19 t o 20, IGA mod 2011 baseline score ranged from \"mode rate\" (62% ) to \"severe\" (38% ), media n Surface Area (BSA) 27 and medi an Dermatolo gy Life Quality Index (DLQI) score from 10 to 12. Approximately 15 to 25% of patients in phase III studies had psori atic arthritis (PsA) at baseline. Psoriasis Study 1 (ERASURE) evaluated 738 patients. Patients randomized to Cosen tyx received 150 mg or 300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 follow ed by the same dose every mont h. Patients random ized to receive placebo who were non-respond ers at week 12 were Cosentyx Dec 2021.SIN Page 17 of 71 then crossed over to receive Cose ntyx (either 150 mg or 300 mg) at weeks 12, 13, 14, and 15, follow ed by the same dose every mont h starting at week 16. All patients were follow ed for up to 52 weeks following fi rst adminis tration of study treatment. Psoriasis Study 2 (FIXTURE) evaluated 1,306 patients. Patients randomized to Cosen tyx received 150 mg or 300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 follow ed by the same dose every mont h. Patients random ized to etanercept received 50 mg doses twice per week for 12 weeks follow ed by 50 mg every week. Patients random ized to receive placebo who were non- respond ers at week 12 then crossed over to receive Cosent yx (either 150 mg or 300 mg) at weeks 12, 13, 14, and 15, follow ed by the same dose every month starting at week 16. All patients were followed for up to 52 weeks followin g first administration of study treatment. Psoriasis Study 3 (FEATURE) evaluated 177 patients using a pre-filled syringe compa red with placebo after 12 weeks of treatment to assess the safety, tolerability, and usabili ty of Cose randomized to Cosent yx received 150 mg or 300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 follow ed by the same dose every mont h. Patients were also randomized to receive placebo at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by the same dose every mont h. Psoriasis Study 4 (JUNCTURE) evaluated 182 pa tients using a pre-filled pen compa red with placebo after 12 weeks of trea tment to assess the safety, tolerability, and us ability of Cosentyx self-administration via the pre-filled pen. Patients random ized to Cosen tyx received 150 mg or 300 mg doses at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 follow ed by the same dose every mont h. Patients were also randomized to receive placebo at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by the same dose e very month. Psoriasis Study 5 (SCULPTURE) evaluated 966 patients.

Statistically significant improvements at Week 4 from baseline in patients treated with secukinumab compared to patients treated with ustekinumab (CLEAR) were demonstrated in the DLQI (Dermatology Life Quality Index), and these improvements were maintained for up to 52 weeks. The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire -Psoriasis outcomes (WPAI -PSO) showed greater improvement in patients treated with secukinumab compared to patients treated with ustekinumab. Statistically significant improvements in patient reported signs and symptoms of itching, pain and scaling at Week 16 and Week 52 (CLEAR) were demonstrated in the Psoriasis Symptom Cosentyx Dec 2021.SIN Page 22 of 71 Diary in patients treated with secukinumab compared to patients treated with ustekinumab. Statistically sign ificant improvements at Week 12 from baseline compared to placebo (SCALP) were demonstrated in the HRQoL (Health Related Quality of Life Index) as measured by Scalpdex. These improvements were observed starting at Week 4 and were maintained through 24 weeks. Statistically significant improvements (decreases) at week 12 from baseline (SCALP) were demonstrated in patient reported signs and symptoms of scalp itching ( -59.4%), pain ( -45.9%), and scaling ( -69.5%), whereas placebo treated patients demonstrated wo rsening (increases) in scalp itching (7.7%) and pain (38.5%), and less improvement in scaling ( -4.7%). 300 mg/2 mL pre -filled pre -filled pen Two randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled studies in patients with plaque psoriasis were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of secukinumab 300 mg when administered subcutaneously as a single 2 mL pre -filled syringe (ALLURE, 214 patients) or as a single 2 mL pre -filled pen (MATURE, 122 patients) compared to secukinumab 300 mg when administered as two subcutaneous injections in a 150 mg/1 mL pre -filled syringe. The co - primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 r esponse and IGA mod 2011 'clear' or 'almost clear' response versus placebo at Week 12. In the ALLURE study, the proportion of subjects achieving a PASI 75 and an IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 responses at Week 12 were 88.9% and 76.4% for the secukinumab 300 mg/2mL pre - filled syringe group compared to 1.7% and 1.4% in the placebo group. In the MATURE study, the proportion of subjects achieving a PASI 75 and an IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 responses at Week 12 were 95.1% and 75.6% for the secukinumab 300 mg/2mL pre -filled pen group compared to 10% and 7.6% in the placebo group. PASI 90 response at Week 12 was achieved with secukinumab 300 mg/2mL pre -filled syringe (ALLURE study) and secukinumab 300 mg/2mL pre-filled pen (MATURE study) compared to placebo in 66.7% versus 1.6% of subjects, respectively (ALLURE study) and 75.6% versus 5% of subjects, respectively (MATURE study). The overall patient experience with subcutaneous self -injection with the 300 mg/2 mL pre - filled syringe and the 300 mg/2 mL pre -filled pen was measured usi ng the Self -Injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ). In the ALLURE study, the proportion of \"very satisfied\" Cosentyx Dec 2021.SIN Page 23 of 71 and \"satisfied\" patients reached 89.5% at Week 28.

The co -primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 75% (PASI 75) and IGA mod 2011 'clear' or 'almost clear' (0 or 1) with at least a 2 point improvement from baseline to Week 12. The key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a reduction in PASI score of at least 90% (PASI 90) from baseline to Week 12. Other secondary endpoints included PASI 50, 100 responder rates at Week 12, PASI 50, 75, 90, 100 and IGA 0/1 responder rates a t Week 16 and over time up to and including Week 52, change in PASI score over time up to and including Week 52 and IGA score over time up to and including Week 52, the proportion of patients with a Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) score o f 0 or 1 at Week 12 and over time up to and including Week 52, and change from baseline in CDLQI compared to placebo at Week 12 and over time up to and including Week 52. During the 12 week placebo- controlled period, the efficacy of both the low and the hi gh dose of secukinumab was comparable for the co -primary endpoints. The odds ratio estimates in favor of both secukinumab doses were clinically relevant and statistically significant for both the PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 'clear' or 'almost clear' (0 or 1) responses. All patients were followed for efficacy and safety during the 52 weeks following the first dose. The proportion of patients achieving PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 'clear' or 'almost clear' (0 or 1) responses showed separation between secukinumab tre atment groups and placebo at the first post- baseline visit at Week 4, the difference becoming more prominent at Week 12. The response was maintained throughout the 52 week time period. Improvement in PASI 50, 90, 100 responder rates and CDLQI 0 or 1 scores were also maintained throughout the 52 week time period. In addition, PASI 75, IGA 0 or 1, PASI 90 response rates at Weeks 12 and 52 for both secukinumab low and high dose groups were higher than the rates for patients treated with etanercept.

Anti-TNF -alpha -IR patients on 300mg showed higher response rates on ACR20 compared to placebo patients (p<0.05) and demonstrated cli nical meaningful benefit over 150 mg on multiple secondary endpoints. Improvements in the PASI75 response were seen regardless of previous anti -TNF -alpha exposure. In PsA2, t he proportion of patients achieving a modified PsA Response Criteria (PsARC) respo nse was greater in the Cosentyx -treated patients (59.0% and 61.0% for 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively) compared to placebo ( 26.5%) at Week 24. At Weeks 16 and 24, improvements in parameters of peripheral activity characteristic of psoriatic arthritis (e.g. number of painful/tender joints, dactylitis, enthesitis and modified nail psoriasis were seen in the Cosentyx -treated pati ents (nominal p - value p<0.01).

Efficac y was maintained up to Week 104. Radiographic response In PsA3 Study, structural damage was assessed radiographically and expressed by the modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) and its components, the Erosion Score (ES) and the Joint Space Narrowing Score (JSN). Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet were obtaine d at baseline Week 16 and/or Week 24 and scored independently by at least two readers who were blinded to treatment group and visit number. Cosentyx 150 mg and 300 mg treatment significantly inhibited the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage compared with placebo treatment as measured by change from baseline in mTSS at Week 24 (Table 13). The percentage of patients with no disease progression (defined as a change from baseline in mTSS of 0.5) from randomization to Week 24 was 79.8%, 88.0% and 73.6% for Cosentyx 150 mg, 300 mg and placebo, respectively. An effect of inhibition of structural damage was observed irrespective of concomitant MTX use or TNF status. Structural damage was also assessed in the PsA1 Study. Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet were obtained at baseline and Week 24 during the double -blind period when patients were on Cosentyx or placebo and at Week 52 when all patients were on open- label Cosentyx. By Week 24, Cosentyx 150 mg treatment significantly inhibited the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage compared with placebo treatment as measured by change from baseline in mTSS (see Table 13).

Improvements in HAQ -DI scores were seen regardless of previous anti -TNF -alpha exposure. There was greater improvement in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores in the Cosentyx groups as compared to placebo at Week 24 ( p<0.01) . There was also greate r improvement in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue (FACIT -F) scores in the 150 mg and 300 mg Cosentyx groups when compared to placebo at Week 24 (p<0.01) , and these improvements were maintained up to Week 104 in PsA2. Cosentyx- treated patients reported significant improvements in health -related quality of life as measured by the Short Form (36) Health Survey Physical Component Summary (SF -36 PCS) score (p<0.001). Improvements were also seen for EQ -5D. In addition improvements were s een in the psoriatic arthritis QoL (PsAQoL p<0.01) and in psoriatic arthritis -related productivity at work and within household, as reported by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment -General Health questionnaire (WPAI -GH) compared to placebo at Week 24. In PsA1 Study, Cosentyx- treated patients significantly improved physical function as assessed by HAQ -DI and SF -36 Physical Components at Week 24.

(axSpA) without radiographic damage Ankylosing spondylitis with radiographic damage The safety and efficacy of Cosentyx were assessed in 816 patients in three randomized, double - blind, placebo- controlled phase III studies in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) with a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity (BASDAI) 4 drug (DMARD) therapy. Patients in the AS1 Study and AS2 Study had a diagnosis of AS for a median of 2.7 to 5.8 years. The efficacy and safety of Cosentyx 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg were evaluated versus placebo with either an i.v. or s .c. loading regimen. In Ankylosing Spondylitis 1 Study (AS1 Study) , (AS3 Study), 27.0% , 38.8% and 23.5% of patients, respectively, were previously treated with an Cosentyx Dec 2021.SIN Page 36 of 71 anti-TNF -alpha agent and discontinued the anti -TNF -alpha agent for either lack of efficacy or intolerance (anti -TNF -alpha -IR patients). AS1 Study (MEASURE 1) evaluated 371 patients, of whom 14.8% and 33.4% used concomitant MTX or sulfasalazine, respectively. Patients randomized to Cosentyx received 10 mg/kg, i.v. at Weeks 0, 2, and 4, followed by either 75 mg or 150 mg s.c. every month. Patients randomized to receive placebo who were non- responders at Week 16 were crossed over to receive Cosentyx (either 7 5 mg or 150 mg) at Week 16, followed by the same dose every month. Patients randomized to receive placebo who were responders at Week 16 were crossed over to receive Cosentyx (either 75 mg or 150 mg) at Week 24, followed by the same dose every month. The p rimary end point was at least a 20% improvement in Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Societ y (ASAS20) criteria at Week 16. AS2 Study (MEASURE 2) evaluated 219 patients, of whom 11.9% and 14.2% used concomitant MTX or sulfasalazine, respectively . Patients randomized to Cosentyx received 75 mg or 150 mg s.c. at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 followed by the same dose every month. At Week 16, patients who were randomized to placebo at baseline were re- randomized to receive Cosentyx (either 75 mg or 150 mg) s.c. every month. The primary end point was ASAS 20 at Week 16. AS3 Study (MEASURE 3) evaluated 226 patients, of whom 13.3% and 23.5% used concomitant MTX or sulfasalazine, respectively. Patients randomized to Cosentyx received 10 mg/kg, i.v. at Weeks 0, 2, and 4, followed by either 150 mg or 300 mg s.c. every month. A t Week 16, patients who were randomized to placebo at baseline were re- randomized to receive Cosentyx (either 150 mg or 300 mg) s.c. every month. The primary end point was ASAS20 at Week 16. Patients were blinded to the treatment regimen up to Week 52, and the study continued to Week 156. Clinical response Signs and symptoms In AS2 Study, treatment with Cosentyx 150 mg resulted in greater improvement in ASAS20, ASAS40, high- sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP), ASAS 5/6 and BASDAI score compared with plac ebo at Week 16 (see Table 14 ).

In AS 2 Study, among 72 patients initially randomised to Cosentyx 150 mg, 61 (84.7%) patients were still on treatment at Week 52. Of the 72 patients randomised to Cosentyx 150 mg, 45 and 35 had an ASAS 20/40 response, respectively . In AS3 Study, Cosentyx treated patients (150 mg and 300 mg) demonstrated improved signs and symptoms, and had comparable efficacy responses regardless of dose that were superior to placebo at Week 16 for the primary endpoint (ASAS20). Overall, the effica cy response rates for the 300 mg group were consistently greater compared to the 150 mg group for the secondary endpoints. During the blinded period, the ASAS20 and ASAS40 responses were 69.7% and 47.6% for 150 mg and 74.3% and 57.4% for 300 mg at Week 52, respectively. The ASAS20 and ASAS40 responses were maintained through Week 156 (69.5% and 47.6% for 150 mg vs. 74.8% and 55.6% for 300 mg). The ASAS partial remission (ASAS PR) responses were 9.5% and 21.1% for 150 mg and 300 mg respectively, compared to 1.3% for placebo at Week 16. The ASAS PR responses were 18.1% and 24.3% for 150 mg and 300 mg at Week 52, respectively. These responses were maintained through Week 156 (15.1% for 150 mg and 27.2% for 300 mg). Spinal mobility Spinal mobility was assessed b y BASMI up to Week 52. In AS2 Study (150 mg) and in AS1 Study (75mg and 150 mg), numerically greater improvements in each BASMI component were demonstrated in Cosentyx- treated patients compared with placebo -treated patients at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 (except for lateral lumbar flexion in patients on 75 mg following the IV load at Weeks 4, 8, and 12). Physical function and health- related quality of life In AS2 Study, patients treated with Cosentyx 150 mg showed improvements by Week 16 compared to placebo -treated patients in physical function as assessed by the BASFI ( -2.15 vs -0.68, p< 0.0001) and in pain as assessed by the Total and Nocturnal Back Pain s cale ( -29.64 vs -9.64, p<0.0001). Cosentyx- treated patients reported improvements compared to placebo - treated patients in tiredness (fatigue) as reported at Week 16 by scores on the Functional Cosentyx Dec 2021.SIN Page 40 of 71 Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy- Fatigue (FACIT -Fatigue) s cale and in health -related quality of life as measured by ASQoL (LS mean change: - 4.00 vs - 1.37, p<0.001) and SF -36 Physical Component Summary (SF -36 PCS) (LS mean change: 6.06 vs 1.92, p< 0.001). Cosentyx 150 mg had numerically larger mean improvements than placebo for three of the four Work Productivity and Activity Impairment -General Health (WPAI -GH) outcomes at Week 16. These improvements were sustained up to Week 52. In AS1 Study, Cosentyx- treated patients reported improvement in physical function comp ared to placebo- treated patients at Week 16, as assessed by the BASFI, Total and Nocturnal Back Pain scale, FACIT -Fatigue, ASQoL, EQ -5D and SF -36 Physical Component Summary. Numerically greater increases in work productivity as measured with the WPAI -GH we re also observed at Week 16 (tests of significance not performed). These improvements in physical function were all sustained up to Week 52. Inhibition of inflammation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) In an imaging sub- study including 105 anti -TNF -alpha -na\u00efve patients in AS1 Study, signs of inflammation were assessed by MRI at baseline and Week 16 and expressed as change from baseline in Berlin SI -joint edema score for sacroiliac joints and ASspiMRI- a score and Berlin spine score for the spine. Inhibition of inflammatory signs in both sacroiliac joints and the spine was observed in damage The safety and efficacy of Cosentyx were assessed in 555 patients in one randomized, double - blind, placebo- controlled phase III study in patients with active non -radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr -axSpA) fulfilling the Assessment classification criteria for axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) with no radiographic evidence of changes in the sacroiliac joints that would meet the modified New York criteria for ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Patients enrolled ha d active disease, defined as a Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) 4, a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for total back pain of 40 (on a scale of 0 -100 mm), despite current or previous non- steroidal anti-inflammatory thera py protein (CRP) and/or evidence of sacroiliitis on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Patients in this study had a Cosentyx Dec 2021.SIN Page 41 of 71 diagnosis of axSpA for a median of 2.1 to 3.0 years and 54% of the study participants were female. In nr -axSpA 1 Study, 57.6% of patients had increased CRP, 72.2% had evidence of sacroiliitis on MRI and 29.9% had both increased CRP and evidence of sacroiliitis on MRI. In addition, 9.7% of patients were previously treated with an anti -TNF -alpha agent and discontinued the anti-TNF -alpha agent for lack of efficacy or intolerance (anti -TNF -alpha -IR patients). Nr-axSpA 1 Study (PREVENT) evaluated 555 patients, of whom 9.9% and 14.8% used concomitant MTX or sulfasalazine, respectively. In the double- blind period, patients received either placebo or Cosentyx for 52 weeks. Patients randomized to Cosentyx received 150 mg s.c. at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 followed by the same dose every month, or a once monthly injection of Cosentyx 150 mg. The primary endpoint was at least 40% improvement in ASAS 40 at Week 16 in TNF -naive patients. Clinical response Signs and symptoms In nr -axSpA1 Study, treatment with Cosentyx 150 mg resulted in significant improvements in the measures of disease activity compared to placebo at Week 16.

NON-CLINICAL SAFETY DATA Non-clinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on tissue cross-reactivity testin g, safety pha rmacology, repeated dose and reproduc tive toxicity stu dies performed with secukinum ab or a murine anti-murine IL-17A antibody. Since secukinum binds to monke y and human IL-17A, its sa fety was studied in the cynomol gus monk ey. No unde sirable effects of secukinum ab were seen followin g subcutaneous administration to cynomo lgus monkeys for up to 13 weeks and intraveneous administration up to 26 weeks (including ph armacoki netic, pharmaco dynamic, immunog enicity and immunot oxici ty (e.g. T cell dependent antibody response and NK cell activity) evaluations). The average serum concentrations observed in monk eys after 13 w eekly subcutane ous doses of 150 mg/kg are 48-fold higher than the predicted average serum concent ration expected in psori atic patients at the highest clinical dose. The exposure mul tiples are even higher when the average serum concentration from the 26 weeks in travenous toxicology study in cynomol gus monke ys are taken into conside ration. Antibodi es to secukinum ab were detected in only one out of 101 animals. No non-specific t issue cross- reactivity was demonstr ated when secukinum ab was applied to norm al human t issues. Animal studies have not been conduc ted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of secukinum ab.
