[ Modern Healthcare: Health Insurance Prior Authorization Rules Proposed By CMS ](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/law-regulation/health-insurance-prior-authorization-rules-proposed-cms) The regulation would require Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and health insurance exchange carriers to ease their prior authorization processes and respond to \"urgent\" requests within 72 hours and standard requests within seven days.
