Page 1 Bruce Brockstein, MD Medical Director, NorthShore Kellogg Cancer Center Division Head, Hematology Oncology Kellogg-Scanlon Chair of OncologyJust a few years ago, only 20% of cancers were treatable by immunotherapy. Today, however, immunotherapy plays a role in nearly 40% of cancer treatments. NorthShore remains ahead of the curve in offering these pioneering therapies that harness the body's own immune system to identify and eradicate cancer cells. Beginning with clinical trials and compassionate use of commercially available drugs, our clinicians have worked together to share expertise and minimize side effects while imparting long-term benefits for a growing number of patients. New programs, like our CAR T-cell therapy, will help pave the way for other treatments including the first-ever treatment for ocular melanoma\u2014an immunotherapy drug that has a similar side effect profile to CAR T-cell therapy. NorthShore is also advancing the use of oncolytic viral injectable immunotherapy for subcutaneous and other Seth Krantz, MD, and oncologist Tom Hensing, MD, have been recognized for their work devoted to predictive modeling and related benefits of immunotherapy for lung cancer patients. Dr. Hensing leads a team partnering with West Virginia University and Case Western Reserve University in a groundbreaking study. Kellogg Cancer Center continues to lead and participate in numerous immunotherapy clinical trials.Immunotherapy\u2014Driving Major Advances in Treatment David J.

Winchester, MD, Chair of Surgical Oncology Dr. Bruce Brockstein Dr. David J. Winchester Led by hematologist David Grinblatt, MD, our recently certified program offering CAR T-cell treatment for lymphoma patients is one of the first non-university-based programs in the state. The promising FDA-approved therapy is the best new option for patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma. CAR T-cell therapy involves chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) genetically modified T cells that are designed to recognize specific antigens on tumor cells, which then activate and pr oliferate to destroy malignant cells. The patient's own immune cells are collected by a pr ocess similar to dialysis, engineered to fight the lymphoma cells and then given back to the patient. \"This is an important move forward for patients whose disease was not responsive to other treatments,\" said Dr. Grinblatt.Immunotherapy Total Number of Patients and Doses Number of Patients Number of Doses0100200300400500 2012 2013 2014 2015 Total Number of Patients and Doses Lymphoma specialists Dr. David Grinblatt (from left), Advanced Practice Nurse Mila Ter-Saakyants, Dr. Amy Wang and Dr. Lynne Kaminer are part of the team offering promising new immunotherapy treatment to patients with relapsed lymphoma.CAR T-Cell Program for Lymphoma Patients*Jan-Dec 2022 (annualized)Page 2 For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer or call (847) 570-2112 or scan the QR code on the back cover.Cancer is the result of mistakes in DNA, telling the cell to grow and act in an uncontrolled way. Most normal cells turn over, meaning there is some amount of both cell division and cell death. When a cell dies, it releases DNA outside the cell and thus the DNA can be detected in blood. Some drugs exist that target specific DNA \"mistakes,\" and advanced testing helps identify the biomarker-specific therapy. NorthShore's expert Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Department performs the advanced tests in-house, allowing for faster turnaround times and better communication between the lab team and clinicians on complex cases. The laboratory team is exploring development of new cell-free DNA testing for Kellogg Cancer Center patients to continue to enhance personalized therapy.

Page 3 Chantay Gresham has had more than her share of strug-gles, preparing to die at just 46 years old. But thanks to her care from oncologist Bruce Brockstein, MD, and her participation in the Kellogg Cancer Genomic Initiative (KCGI), she has hope and a new lease on life. When Gresham found her way to the Kellogg Cancer Center team, she was incredibly sick with a large and very rare sarcoma tumor that had grown in her abdomen, interfering with her liver and kidney function. She first started feeling ill in May 2021. Unable to keep any food down, Gresham was subjected to test after test as she continued to lose weight. Finally, doctors close to her home in Rockford determined that she had cancer, and Gresham chose to have her care at the Kellogg Cancer Center. Dr. Brockstein and the Kellogg team first hoped that the tumor could be removed by expert gastrointestinal sur - geon Melissa Hogg, MD, but the tumor pr oved to be too involved with her nearby organs. The cancer was identified as a sarcoma, and Gresham began treatment to shrink it\u2014but neither radiation nor chemotherapy worked . \"My family and I were just trying to accept that I was going to pass away from this cancer,\" recalled Gresham. But molecular profiling of her tumor as part of the KCGI study success-fully identified a genetic abnormality and a medication that could work for her. The KCGI team was able to get Gresham on the medication that in a matter of months began to shrink the tumor. A CT scan this summer showed that the tumor was smaller. \"For the first time, I had some good news. It was really the first hope I've had in over NorthShore is bringing sophisticated laboratory cancer screening innova-tions to our primary care patients through new research studies not available at any other system in the state.

While the medication has left her feeling very tired, Gresham has been able to get off a feeding tube and move back to her own home after staying with family when she was so ill. Dr. Brockstein is cautiously optimistic that the tumor will continue to shrink enough on the medication and can be removed surgically. Gresham will have another CT scan and meet with Dr. Hogg to talk about next steps. \"As of now, I'm just trying to stay as positive as I can,\" said Gresham. Dr. Brockstein is one of the best doctors I've ever had, and I know Dr. Hogg is a rock star. The care they've shown me is so important.\" \"It's so gratifying to help patients like Chantay with the collaborative team involved in the KCGI and her care,\" said Dr. Brockstein. \"Having molecular testing available for a cancer that's so rare, like hers, is a huge benefit to our patients.\" \"At one point, I didn't even have a future to contemplate,\" said Gresham, \"and now I'm just looking forward to living my life.\"Kellogg Cancer Genomic InitiativeC Next-generation tumor sequencing to characterize the tumor mutations of patients with advanced or metastatic cancer to help determine the best course of therapy is progressing in the Kellogg Cancer Genomic Initiative (KCGI). Nurse Practitioners Gayathri Moorthy, PhD, and Annette Sereika, APN, work with patients joining the study, explaining the study and how their participation can potentially help with their treatment. When genomic abnormalities are found, together with the molecular pathology team, they then conduct literature reviews to see which drugs may have utility for a specific patient's mutation. As part of the KCGI trial, patients receive pharmacogenomics testing to learn about their body's ability to react to various medications. As a nurse who also holds a PhD in molecular biology, Dr. Moorthy is a perfect fit for the multidisciplinary KCGI team working to push the boundaries and do more with genomic information. \"As an organization we want to do everything we can. We want to really stretch for each patient in our care,\" she said, \"and this kind of personalized medicine helps us do that.\" \"KCGI really leverages the strengths of NorthShore's molecular pathology and bioinformatics teams,\" said Sereika, \"and the success of the study is the result of the tremendous teamwork of so many different departments.\" To date, 164 patients have been enrolled in KCGI.cancer screening modalities, these research studies aim to improve the ability to detect cancers earlier and improve outcomes compared to standard cancer screening alone.

KCGI patients Addressing Health Disparities Improving health equity for our patients and the communities we serve is an ongoing commitment for NorthShore and the focus of collab-orative teamwork. After identifying a breast cancer screening disparity using a Lens of Equity tool developed by our analytics team, the Breast Health Center, Patient Care Center, analytics and Health Equity Impact Team (HEIT) worked together to drive improvement in screening rates. Low screening rates for non-white and lower-income patients increased their risk for a delayed breast cancer diagnosis. The team worked to streamline mammography services and improve access for vulnerable populations. Frontline team members called close to 1,000 patients and helped schedule nearly 200 additional screenings to date. The HEIT brought on a dedicated health equity community liaison to perform continued outreach and help patients navigate breast cancer screenings. We continue to work to close the health equity gap for breast cancer screening.Pharmacogenomic Testing Supports Individualized Care receive pharmacogenomic testing in addition to targeted molecular testing of their tumor samples. Beyond guidance on nausea and pain management, pharmacogenomics can provide significant value to cancer As next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) has quite literally revolutionized medicine with widespread testing for genomic anomalies and polymorphisms, the need for managing large amounts of data and interpreting results has created new challenges and opportunities. Flype is a web-based bioinformatics platform developed at NorthShore that incorporates the data from NGS into workflows, making it usable for clinicians. NorthShore's Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology team led by Director Larry Helseth, PhD, helps the molecular pathology team interpret DNA sequence results and then creates reports that are sent for oncologists' review.\"We use Flype to help organize patient results and interpretations for molecular tumor boards where advanced practice nurses, pharmacists, oncologists, pathologists and bioinformaticians meet virtually to review each patient's case and see how best to tailor their treatment to the molecular markers identified in their tumors,\" said Dr. Helseth. \"The days of treating cancer based on the origin of the tumor are long gone.\" Flype is also used to help integrate molecular test results from NorthShore and external facilities and match that data to patient outcomes to gain insight into treating future patients with specific molecular markers. Bioinformatics and Molecular Pathology Revolutionizing Treatment Prostate cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer, and studies show that inherited factors account for 57% of the risk for developing prostate cancer. Black men have a substantially higher incidence of prostate cancer and higher related death rates than the general popula-tion. A genomics program led by Brian Helfand, MD, PhD, the Ronald L. Chez Family and Richard Melman Family Endowed Chair of Prostate Cancer, has specifically focused on the high prevalence of prostate cancer in Black men. Dr. Helfand authored Using Genomics to Target High Rates of Prostate Cancer in Black Men an article in the Clinical Leader newsletter highlighting NorthShore's successful program and encouraging more protocols and interventions that promote the inclusion of diverse populations. \"Genomics research is shaping the future of prostate cancer and medicine at large,\" stated Dr. Helfand. \"To improve health equity and benefit society, it's important that the diversity of patients taking advantage of clinical genomics is reflected in our clinic strategies.\"Closing the Health Equity Gap in Breast Cancer Screening Community Liaison Diana Alvarezpatients by assisting with therapeutic selection of psychiatry medications, including antidepressants. A recent pilot program led by Senior Clinical Specialist Dyson Wake, PharmD, incorporated pharmacoge-nomics testing in initial laboratory orders for new oncology patients treated with one of three specific chemotherapy drugs. During the two-month pilot involving select oncologists, patients with potential sensitivity to their planned chemo-therapy regimens were identified, and discussion is now underway to expand the program. The pharmacogenomics team's knowledge base and expertise provide vital clinical support. In the past year, the team published four articles, an abstract and had three posters accepted and graduated its inaugural resident. The resident is a key team member who helped investigate potentially targetable variants and presented patients at regular tumor board meetings.

Studies show that it is never too late to quit smoking to gain potential health benefits. NorthShore now has more trained specialists with more dedicated time to see patients, especially those with a new cancer diagnosis. Kellogg is also participating in the Commission on Cancer \"Just Ask\" program, a national quality improvement project and clinical study. The initiative is designed to improve upon current smoking assessments by leveraging existing resources. Every new cancer patient is asked about their smoking history. An automatic referral for an appointment with a tobacco cessation specialist is built into the electronic health record (EHR) for current smokers. Continued smoking/tobacco use after a cancer diagnosis decreases survival, reduces treatment efficacy and increases the risk of recurrence.Bile duct cancers\u2014 also called cholangio- carcinoma\u2014are rare, affecting fewer than six people in 100,000 according to the National Cancer Institute. When 75-year-old Gerald Gray, DDS, was diagnosed in early 2022, he quickly appreciated the ben - efits of a sub-specialty group like the team at the Kellogg Cancer Center who successfully treated his cholan - giocarcinoma. Symptoms that initially mimicked gallbladder trouble began Dr. Gray's \"whirlwind\" of a cancer journey. General surgeon John Linn, MD, ordered a special MRI\u2014called a magnetic resonance cholangiopancrea- tograph y\u2014to provide detailed images of the hepatobiliary and pancreatic systems. Dr. Gray was admitted the same day and referred to expert oncology surgeon Melissa Hogg, MD, who reviewed his images while she was out of town to confirm the diagnosis. He then had an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with gastroenterologist Shailesh Bajaj, MD, who specializes in advanced therapeutic endoscopy and pancreati-cobiliary disease, before having surgery with Dr. Hogg, who removed the tumor, bile duct, gallbladder and area lymph nodes. \"I was scheduled for a doctor's office visit, and within two days I had the visit consult, an MRCP , an ERCP with stent placement and an appointment to see a surgeon two days after discharge,\" said Dr . Gray. \"The NorthShore system worked seamlessly, and I had five-star treatment all the way around.\" A retired endodontist, Dr. Gray and his wife, who is a retired surgical nurse, both have a medical background and were more than impressed with the expert and compassionate care he received. Following his surgery, Dr. Gray had a consult for a second Subspecialty Expertise Attacks Rare Cancer Helping More Patients Quit SmokingBMore subspecialty expertise is now available for patients at Swedish Hospital with additional surgeons and medical oncologists joining the team and others adding clinic hours at the NorthShore campus in the city. In addition to the growing roster of subspecialty physicians providing care, more robust support services are also part of the Swedish Hospital cancer team. Patients have access to a specially trained dietitian, social worker, psychologist and patient financial advocate for practical and emotional support and services throughout their cancer journey. Patient assistance grants continue to support the integrated cancer care program with fundamental fitness and complementary treatments offered through the Galter LifeCenter. A new Scheduling Coordinator program modeled after the Kellogg Cancer Center program provides an additional point person to help patients better navigate what can feel like an overwhelming number of appointments and next steps. \"As a physician, it's gratifying to be better able to serve our patients with a fully staffed team of nurses and social work and other services that are so valuable,\" said Swedish Hospital Cancer Center Medical Director Jeffrey Cilley, MD. Plans to expand/renovate the physical space at Swedish Hospital will allow the cancer center to continue to grow with room for more subspecialists and more capacity to care for an increasing number of cancer patients in the community.Sameer Alvi, MD Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Cancers Hassan Arshad, MD Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Cancers Elizabeth Burke, MD Plastic Surgery/Breast Reconstruction Nicholas Campbell, MD Lung Cancer, Esophageal Cancer, Head and Neck Cancers Jalal Damani, DO Interventional Pulmonology, Lung Nodule Biopsy Melissa Hogg, MD, MS Director, Liver and Pancreas Surgery Mary Tilley Jenkins Vogel, MD Gynecologic Oncology Andrew Johnson, MD Neurological Surgery, Brain and Spine Tumors Benjamin Johnson, MD General Surgery, Minimally Invasive, Robotic Colon Cancer Surgery Daniel Laich, DO Neurological Surgery, Spine Surgery, Spine Tumors Janette Maldonado, MD General Surgery, Minimally Invasive, Robotic Colon Cancer Surgery Cecylia Mizera, MD General Surgery, Breast Surgeon Elizabeth Poli, MD Breast Surgeon Thomas (T.J.)

Ten CLP winners were chosen from more than 80 submis-sions, recognizing their hard work and dedication to improving the quality of care for cancer patients. Among Dr. Krantz's many contributions noted in his nomination are his tireless efforts for the Kellogg Cancer Center's smoking cessation pro - gram. Dr. Krantz's leadership helped expand services through training additional tobacco tr eatment specialists at Mayo Clinic and establishing automatic referrals within the EHR for any new cancer patients identified as a smoker. \"He reminds patients that it's never too late to quit and that it often takes multiple attempts to quit for good. Dr. Krantz is a tried and true trailblazer for improvement,\" said his nomination. \"It's an honor to work with Dr. Krantz and to see his commit-ment to quality, safety improvement in the best interest of our patients and program,\" said Cancer Committee Nurse Coordinator Jamie Feld.Swedish Hospital New Specialist Coverage opinion at Mayo Clinic and was told he was fortunate to have an oncology surgeon with the advanced skills of Dr. Hogg. Following surgery, Dr. Gray began treatment with oncologist Robert Marsh, MD, who recommended both chemotherapy and radiation, the best protocol for beating the rare cancer. \"I feel fortunate to have Dr. Marsh in charge of my care\u2014five stars again,\" said Dr. Gray, who also had high praise for radiation oncologist Arif Shaikh, MD. \"All of these physicians, the speed with which care has been provided, the professional care and expertise given to me have saved my life,\" added Dr. Gray. \"He's done very well with the treat- ment, and all indicators are quite positive now,\" said Dr. Marsh, who will continue to closely monitor Dr. Gray with scans and bloodwork for the next few years. While he initially had some serious side effects with the chemotherapy, Dr. Gray said Dr. Marsh and his team managed them quickly , adjusting doses and offering therapeutic options. Dr. Gray's last scan in October was clear. \"It truly is a team effort across so many disciplines to get patients like this through a complex regimen,\" said Dr. Marsh. Dr. Gray considers himself blessed to be married to Susan, his wife of 46 years, for \"all her sacrifices through this cancer journey and being the best advocate I could ever have.\" He is grateful to the entire Kellogg Cancer team of nurses, Advanced Practice Providers and more. \"They save lives. That's what they do,\" said Dr. Gray. \"I'm living a very blessed life.\"Oncologist Dr. Robert Marsh (left) and surgeon Dr. Melissa Hogg provide collaborative care for patients with complex, advanced cancers.

Page 9 Ashley Conley was 32 weeks pregnant with her fourth child when she started bruising all over and experiencing nose bleeds. At first, she assumed it was due to low iron in pregnancy, but then her gums began to bleed and Conley and her husband decided her unusual symptoms should be evaluated. The 39-year-old mom had blood drawn on a Sunday and received a call before 6:30 a.m. the next day urging her to get to NorthShore Evanston Hospital immediately. Within minutes of her arrival, hematologist Amy Wang, MD, MPH, shared the devastating news that Conley had acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and that her baby would have to be delivered as soon as possible. \"Hours matter at this point,\" Conley was told. A comprehensive team of oncologists, maternal-fetal medicine experts and critical care specialists began meticulously planning the complex treatment and safe delivery of her baby. Conley's life-threating condition put her at risk of severe bleeding and clotting complications while giving birth. \"The good news with APL is that it's highly curable if we get patients over the hump in the first month or two when mortality is highest,\" said Dr. Wang. \"It was fortunate she was at 33 weeks and the obstetrics team was comfort-able with the early delivery.\" Conley was fortunate to have the hematology expertise to recognize the rare condition and the multidisci-plinary, collaborative team that helped her deliver a healthy baby and fight the cancer. Conley was given her first round of ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid), an oral medication to treat APL, while still pregnant, as it is known to be safe for the baby.Innovative Research Driving Clinical ExcellenceQuick Diagnosis and Urgent Delivery Save Mom and Baby Personalized, Genetics-Based Prostate Cancer Care A pioneering collaboration between NorthShore's Program for Personalized Cancer Care (PPCC) and Johns Hopkins University Department of Urology has the potential to transform prostate cancer care. Five new clinical studies will focus on hereditary risk, screening, biopsy and treatment by collecting and analyzing both germline and somatic DNA genetic data from several thousand prostate cancer patients. The prostate cancer team led by Brian Helfand, MD, PhD, and Jianfeng Xu, DrPH, Ellrodt-Schweighauser Family Chair of Cancer Genomic Research, has been supported by generous philanthropy as it works to further personalized prostate cancer screening and treatment strategies. Advancing Surgical Innovation Accomplished oncoplastic breast surgeon Katherine Kopkash, MD, is a princi - pal investigator in the first U.S. clinical trial of robotic assisted nipple-sparing mastectomies for women who are at high risk of developing breast cancer. NorthShor e is the only Illinois site for this landmark study using the robotic approach, which allows the entire operation to be performed through a 3.5 cm incision in the armpit. The procedure leaves patients with minimal scarring, the likelihood of more sensation and an easier recovery. \"I'm excited to lead this trial that will provide surgeons with evidence-based data to support the expansion of this innovative new procedure,\" said Dr. Kopkash. Novel Pancreatic Cancer Screening NorthShore is a regional leader in pancreas research, and our clinical pancreatic database is one of the largest in the country. A collaborative study with the University of Chicago focused on using novel genetic risk factors to identify subjects at high risk of developing pan- creatic cancer and demonstrated the importance of genetic tools for screening. A new study in development will offer genetic testing for monogenic diseases and genetic risk scores for pancreatic cancer patients. First-degree relatives of patients identified as carriers will be offered genetic testing and consultation. This will be the first genetics-based pancreatic screening study in the country. The new study will be led by Mark Talamonti, MD, the Stanton and Margaret Rogers Palmer Chair of Surgery, and Jianfeng Xu, DrPH.A Ashley Conley and her daughter Harlow survived a rare life-threatening cancer. Improving Outcomes and Quality of Life Philanthropic support is helping Katharine Yao, MD, Vice Chair for Research, Department of Surgery, lead innovative studies designed to help improve out - comes and quality of life for patients. Educational mind - fulness video modules targeting newly diagnosed patients, those undergoing treat - ment and survivors wer e developed as part of a novel mindfulness study. Patient responses and coping skills are now being documented and assessed after watching the videos. Other studies are designed to support a proven, data-backed risk assessment score that would be given to all women undergoing screening mammography as part of a strategy to help prevent breast cancer. And a third initiative is looking at universal genetic testing for newly diag- nosed breast cancer patients\u2014specifically, how surgeons and clinicians collectively see the value in genetic testing. \"Supporting breast cancer research and women who face a devastating diagnosis, or carry genes that could become cancer , has been near and dear to my heart for years,\" said Mary Dillon President and CEO of Foot Locker, Inc., who is supporting Dr. Yao's research. \"I've had a longstanding relationship with Dr. Yao. Her knowledge, passion and understanding of what it takes to prevent cancer and ensure the best possible outcomes are unmatched. These studies will move the needle toward more comprehensive screening, early detection and improving overall outcomes. The work she's doing is imperative in this age of genetics and mindfulness.\" Dr. Katherine KopkashDr. Katharine Yao With her platelet levels dropping precipitously, Conley was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, which was deemed the safest place for her to be induced and deliver her baby. A team of close to 30 clinicians\u2014physicians, nurses, anesthesiologists and blood bank support\u2014came together to manage her care and labor, and baby Harlow Rose was born on Feb. 9, 2022. Within an hour of giving birth, Conley was given her first intravenous chemotherapy treatment. \"She's really a tough person. She kept such a level head about everything going on,\" said Dr. Wang. \"I think she was in shock, but she trusted us. She was so strong and knew she had to be for her family.\" Conley was hospitalized for a month to continue receiving chemotherapy that thankfully put her leukemia in remission. She completed several more months of outpatient treatment under Dr. Wang's direction to keep the APL in remission long enough to be cured. While it was an arduous journey, Conley is grateful for the exceptional care she received. \"Harlow is healthy and my boys love having a little sister,\" said Conley. \"I am so thankful for everything.\" Dr. Mark TalamontiPage 10 For more information, visit northshore.org/cancer, call (847) 570-2112 or scan the QR code on the back cover.

Page 11 Hematologist Amy Wang, MD, MPH, earned a NorthShore Auxiliary Research Scholar Award for her work aimed at improving the quality of life for adolescents and young adults (AYA) with blood cancers. AYA blood cancer survivors are a vulnerable group experi-encing high rates of morbidity and early mortality, and Dr. Wang designed and implemented a study during her fellowship training looking at severe symptoms and late effects of therapy for this population. The study was presented at the 2021 and 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology meetings. The Auxiliary grant will support Dr. Wang's efforts to establish a continuity clinic for high-risk survivors of pediatric and AYA cancers and to further her studies r elated to neurocognitive outcomes in AYA blood cancer survivors. Work on the continuity clinic will be a collaborative ef fort with the Kellogg team and Carol Rosenberg, MD, Director of the MRW LIFE Cancer Survivorship Program. \"I am grateful to the Auxiliary for this award, which is helping bring my vision to fruition and serving a vulnerable patient population,\" said Dr. Wang, who will use preliminary data from the study to apply for external funding to help design multi-institutional and cooperative group studies. Thanks in part to our many generous donors, the Kellogg Cancer Center is able to provide patient- and family-centered care. In addition to an ongoing focus on prevention, early detection and advanced treatment options for cancer, we are also committed to offering patients and families a full range of resources to help navigate and manage their cancer journey.

A longstanding partnership with the Cancer Wellness Center is a symbiotic relationship that helps provide cancer patients with additional psychosocial support and resources, as well as education on a variety of essential cancer- related topics. The Cancer Wellness Center offers a range of services including educational programs, well-ness classes, and support services in English and Spanish. Clinical services include individual, family and child counseling as well as support groups for men, women, young adults and anyone bereaved. Experts from NorthShore are tapped to speak at educational programs. \"The Center is a trusted source for evidence-based information to cancer patients and their loved ones,\" said Cancer Wellness Center Program Director Savina Chacheva. \"The services are important as they allow patients to receive individualized support, reduce feelings of stress and improve overall wellbeing.\" The American Cancer Society (ACS) supports many different programs benefiting cancer patients thr oughout the Chicago and northwest suburban region, including providing vital grants for transportation to and from facilities like Kellogg Cancer Center to address one of the key social determinants of health. The ACS also partners with NorthShore in outreach and educational events, including a series of Facebook live events for Spanish speakers with NorthShore phy - sicians like Carolina Soto Chervin, MD. \"Seeing a physician speaking Spanish builds important trust for many patients,\" said ACS Cancer Support Strategic Partnerships Manager Aubree Thelen. \"We're happy to partner with NorthShore and the boots-on-the-ground team of providers. This has been a really successful, con - sistent partnership. We share a mutual desire to find new ways to innovate and support patients.\"In collaboration with the Myra Rubenstein Weis (MRW) Living in the Future (LIFE) Cancer Survivorship Program led by Carol Rosenberg, MD, and Clinical Coordinator Anisha Patel APN, Dr. Elizabeth Kacel facilitated a new three-part \"Evening of Survivorship\" virtual summer lecture series. Fear of cancer recurrence or progression is one of the most common psychological concerns reported by patients diagnosed with all types and stages of cancer. The series was designed to offer patients practical strategies for managing this specific concern in cancer survivorship. The series also featured contributions from the Kellogg team of oncology social workers. More than 200 participants\u2014including patients, family members and healthcare providers\u2014participated in the new series, which received exceptionally positive feedback.Managing Fear of Recurrence and ProgressionVital Community Partnerships Expanded Psychosocial Care Generous funding from Carol Levy in memory of her husband Joseph enabled psychologist Elizabeth Kacel, PhD, to join the Kellogg Cancer Center team in late 2021. In her first year, Dr. Kacel completed nearly 800 patient visits, including new patient consultations and psychotherapy sessions. Treatment sessions focus on the use of evidence-based psychological approaches to improve cancer distress and optimize patients' quality of life during and beyond cancer. \"I am deeply moved by the caring and collaborative nature of the Kellogg Cancer Center team,\" said Dr. Kacel. \"Every day is fast-paced and intense, yet slow and meaningful in how the team provides whole-person care. There's as much laughter as there are tears.\" Providing expert psychological care from within the Kellogg Cancer Center offers many benefits for patients. The location is familiar, the stigma of mental health care is reduced and the role of psychological treatment during cancer is normalized.
