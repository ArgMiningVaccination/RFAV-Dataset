FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION (back to Contents by Section ) A. EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND DEFINITIONS EPA is issuing this solicitation requesting applications for projects that support and/or create model state, tribal, local, and territorial government activities that lead to measurable environmental or public health results in communities disproportionately burdened by environmental harms and risks. These projects will help transform disadvantaged and underserved communities into healthy, thriving communities capable of addressing the environmental and public health challenges they have historically faced, as well as current and future challenges. This competition is being launched in order to meet the goals and objectives of two Executive Orders (EO 14008 and EO 13985) issued by the Biden Administration that demonstrate the EPA's and Administration's commitment to achieving environmental justice an d embedding environmental justice into Agency programs. Executive Order 14008 , Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad, i ssued on January 27, 2021, affirmed the Administration's commitment to advancing environmental justice by creating the Justice40 Initiative. The Justice40 Initiative 1establishes a goal that 40% of the overall benefits of certain federal investments \u2014including those in climate change; clean energy and energy efficiency; clean transit; affordable and sustainable housing; training and workforce development; the remediation and reduction of legacy pollution; and the development of critical clean water infrastru cture \u2014flow to disadvantaged communities. 2 In addition, Section 219 of the Executive Order stressed that environmental and economic justice are key considerations to factor into governmental decision -making and that transforming disadvantaged communities \u2014historically marginalized, underserved, and overburdened\u2014into healthy, thriving communities, and undertaking robust actions to mitigate climate change while preparing for the impacts of climate change across rural, urban, and Tribal areas are governmental p riorities. The Executive Order also called for making environmental justice part of Agency missions by developing programs, policies, and activities to address the disproportionately high and adverse human health, environmental, climate -related and other c umulative impacts on disadvantaged communities, as well as the accompanying economic challenges of such impacts. Complementing Executive Order 14008, is Executive Order 13985 , Advancing Racial Equity And Support For Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government, issued on January 20, 2021, which stated that the federal government should pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all, including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality. \"Environmental justice ,\" which is the common theme of these two Executive Orders, is defined by the EPA is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. Fair treatment means that no one group of people, including r acial, ethnic, or socioeconomic groups, should bear a disproportionate share of the negative environmental consequences resulting from industrial, municipal, and commercial 1 Further information on J40 can be found in OMB's interim implementation guidance for the Justice40 Initiative (M- 21-28). 2 EPA is currently in the process of defining the ter m \"disadvantaged communities.\" -3- operations or the execution of federal, state, local, and tribal environmental programs and policies. Meaningful involvement means that: People have an opportunity to participate in decisions about activities that may affect their environment and/or health; The public's contribution can influence the regulatory agency's decision; Community concerns will be considered in the decision- making process; and Decision makers will seek out and facilitate the involvement of those potentially affected. The underserved and disadvantaged communities for which these projects are focused on include, as defined by Executive Order 13985, \"populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life...\". This includes communities such as Black, Latino, and Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color; children, the e lderly, members of (LGBTQ+) disabilities; persons who live in rural areas; and persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality. For purposes of this RFA, \"underserved communities\" also includes \"environmentally overburdened communities\" (that is, communities adversely and disproportionately affected by environmental, climate and human health harms and risks including remote, rural, and urban c ommunities), and disadvantaged communities. Community -based Nonprofit Organizations (CBOs) For this RFA, the EJ Grants program defines a \"community -based nonprofit organization\" (CBO) as a public or private nonprofit organization that supports and/or represents a community and/or certain populations within a community through engagement, educati on, and other related services provided to individual community residents and community stakeholders. A \"community\" can be characterized by a particular geographic area and/or by the relationships among members with similar interests and can be characteri zed as part of a broader national or regional community where organizations can be focused on the needs of urban, rural, and/or tribal areas, farmworkers, displaced workers, children with high levels of lead, people with asthma, subsistence fishers, and ot her similar groups. B. BACKGROUND OF GOVERNMENT- TO-GOVERNMENT PROGRAM The mission of the EPA is to protect human health and the environment for all people with a n emphasis on assisting those communities adversely and disproportionately affected by environmental, climate , and human health harms and risks. U nder the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, EPA received significant investments for environmental justice and in the health, equity, and resilience of these, and all communities, to address past, current, and future environmental health and justice challenges. Additionally, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) codified the Environmental and Climate Justice block grant program in section 138 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and provided EPA with $2.8 billion in grant funding for the program to benefit disadvantaged communities . To maximize these significant investments, t he Environmental Justice Government -to-Government (EJG2G) program (formally known as the State Environmental Justice Cooperative Agreement [ SEJCA ] program) provides funding to eligible entities to work collaboratively with underserved communities to understand, promote and integrate approaches to -4- provide meaningful and measurable improvements to public h ealth and/or the environment in those communities. Program History - The EPA's Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights (OEJ ECR) first and original efforts to assist States in achieving environmental justice goals and objectives began with the States and Tribal Environmental Justice (STEJ) Grants Program pilot projects which were awarded and developed during fiscal years 1998- 2001. These pilot projects were directed to assist States and tribal governments in the development of env ironmental justice considerations and approaches in their environmental programs. In 2009, the program was relaunched as assistance listing 66.312 ( i.e., The State Environmental Justice Cooperative Agreement [SEJCA] Program) where five cooperative agreemen ts were made to state governments. In 2020, this program was recompeted with expanded eligibility to states, tribal governments, local governments, and US territories which resulted in 31 total awards being made in 2020- 21. Now, for this competition, OEJE CR is re branding this program with a new name that better reflects the multiple entities eligible for the funding as well as the purpose of the program. The newly named Environmental Justice Government -to-Government (EJG2G) program builds on progress made through the initial pilot grant s and more recent cooperative agreements. T he EJG2G program features expanded eligibility to applicants from all levels of government s: State s, tribal governments, local governments , US Territories, and now als o Freely Associated States (FAS). With this expanded program, OEJECR strives to support the integration of environmental justice goals at all levels of government as we collaborate with our government al partners . C. PURPOSE OF THE GOVERNMENT- TO-GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND PROJECTS SOUGHT The purpose of the EJG2G program is to support and/or create model state, tribal, local, and territorial government activities that lead to measurable environmental or public health results in communities disproportionately bur dened by environmenta l harms and risks . These models should leverag e or utiliz e existing resources or assets of state, tribal, local, and territorial agencies to develop key tools and processes that integrate environmental justice considerations into all levels of government and government programs . Projects Sought Under this Funding Opportunity : Projects submitted under this funding opportunity should support the EJG2G program goals detailed below: (1) achieve measurable and mea ningful environmental and/or public health results in communities ; (2) build broad and robust, results -oriented partnerships, particularly with community- based nonprofit organizations (CBOs) within disproportionately impacted areas ; (3) pilot activi ties in specific communities that create models, which can be expanded or replicated in other geographic areas; and (4) strengthen the development and implementation of specific approaches to achieve environmental justice . To help ensure that they will achieve EJG2G program goals, projects should factor in : (1) state and local data ; (2) state and local leadership; (3) state and local results; (4) relationships between delegated programs (i.e., federal environmental programs delegated to and carried out by s tates, tribes, local government, and US territories ) and state, tribal, local, and territorial enviro nmental justice policies, and (5 ) state, tribal, local, and territorial government targeting of -5- disproportionately burdened areas. Information about all EPA Environmental Justice assistance programs, including the EJG2G program, can be found at the website below: https://www.epa .gov/environmentaljustice/environmental- justice- grants -and-resources D. AUTHORITY The EJG2G program is designed to address multi -statute environmental and/or public health issues. In support of this, Congress provided EPA with both funding and expanded authority to further environmental justice through financial assistance programs in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (Public Law 117- 103), which provided funding for environmental justice implementation and training grants. Examples of grant applications involving implementation activities include : small -scale clean -ups, environmental trea tments, pollution abatements, hazardous waste disposal and/or energy recovery projects. Additionally, under the IRA , Congress created the Environmental and Climate Justice Block grant program in Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 138 and appropriated $2.8 billion for grants for projects to bene fit disadvantaged communities . Eligible projects with this funding fall into five broad categories and include: (A) community- led air and other pollution monitoring, prevention, and remediati on, and investments in low - and zero -emission and resilient technologies and related infrastructure and workforce development that help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants; (B) mitigating climate and health risks from urban heat island s, extreme heat, wood heater emissions, and wildfire events; (C) climate resiliency and adaptation; (D) reducing indoor toxics and indoor air pollution; or (E) facilitating engagement of disadvantaged communities in State and Federal advisory groups, works hops, rulemakings, and other public processes. EPA interprets the term \"community -led air and other pollution monitoring, prevention and remediation . . .\" in CAA 138(b)(2)(A) to allow EPA to fund activities to address water pollution, drinking water conta mination, pesticide contamination, toxic substance contamination, solid and hazardous waste contamination, and hazardous substance contamination as well as air pollution. Note that as provided in CAA 314 contractors and subcontractors for construction pro jects receiving financial assistance under CAA 138 must comply with the U.S. Department of Labor's regulations (29 CFR Parts 1, 3, and 5) implementing Davis -Bacon Act prevailing wage requirements. EPA will use the definition of the term Construction in 40 CFR 33.103 to determine Davis Bacon Act applicability. Any infrastructure project as defined in M-22-11 must also comply with the domestic content preferences in the Build America, Buy America Act for iron and steel, manufactured products, and construction materials. Please note that infrastructure projects unde r $250,000 may be covered under EPA's Small Project General Applicability waiver . The EPA also encourages project labor agreements (i.e., pre -hire collective bargaining agreements between unions and contractors that govern terms and conditions of employment for all workers on a construction project); the use of an appropriately trained workforce (i.e., through registered apprenticeships and other joint labor- management training programs that serve all workers, particularly those historically excluded); the use of an appropriately credentialed workforce (i.e., requirements for appropriate and relevant professional training, c ertification, and licensure); and neutrality with respect to union organizing. -6- E. SPEC IAL CONSIDERATIONS For this competition, EPA will give special consideration to applications that address one or more of the following program priorities : Projects addressing Climate Change, Disaster Resiliency, and/or Emergency Preparedness - The effects of climate change and extreme weather events tend to adversely impact the most vulnerable communities and populations disproportionately. Therefore, EPA may give special consideration to projects that address the needs of underserved and vulnerable communities that have bee n adversely impacted or are likely to be adversely impacted by natural disasters, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, floods, earthquakes, and future pandemics. Rural areas - EPA will give special consideration to high- ranking proposals to be performed in rural areas as defined by the program. Rural areas, for the purposes of this competition, are defined as one of the following: 1. Local areas with populations of 50,000 or less that have limited access to public or private resources commonly found in metropolitan areas 2. Community Network areas selected by the Rural Partners Network (See rural.gov for a complete list of communities) 3. Coal and E nergy Communities (See energycommunities.gov for a complete list of communities) Applicants claiming rural status must provide sufficient detail (census data, population figures, descriptions of local resources, etc.) for EPA to validate the rural status of the underserved community. The goal of this special consideration is to encourage and increase project performance in rural areas in the EPA EJ Grants program. Health Impact Assessment (HIA) - HIA is a \"practice that aims to protect and promote health and to reduce inequities in health during a decision- making process .\" 3 One's health is affected by genetics and the health care we receive, but also by the built, social, and natural environments in which we live and work. As such, there is growing recognition that a broad range of decisions can affect health, and health cons equences, positive and negative, should be considered as part of decision -making. EPA may give special consideration to HIA projects that seek to determine the potential effects of a proposed environmental decision (e.g., policy, plan, program, project, ac tion) on the health of underserved and vulnerable communities and the distribution of those effects within the communities. (See section I.G and VIII.H for guidance on developing HIAs .) The special consideration s listed above will only be considered as an \"other factor\" , in addition to the scoring criteria in Section V, in making selection decisions . Additional other factors which may be considered during the selection process can be found in Section V of this fun ding announcement. The selection official may consider any (or all) of these \"other factors\" or none at all in making selection decisions. 3 Bhatia R, Farhang L, Heller J, Lee M, Orenstein M, Richardson M and Wernham A.

G. HEALTH IMPACT ASSESSMENT PROJECT GUIDANCE 1. Health Impact Assessment Case Studies Two Health Impact Assessment ( HIA) case studies are provided below to assist applicants in understanding how an HIA may be structured and implemented. NOTE: Applicants proposing to conduct HIAs through this opportunity will be expected to lead and coordinate the HIA along with their partne rs. Where availability allows, EPA staff may provide technical advice and guidance to an HIA project team. However, EPA staff will not lead the implementation and/or management of any HIA funded through this funding opportunity. a. Gerena School Renovation Project (Springfield, MA): Gerena Community School, located in Springfield, MA, is underwent renovations to improve the environmental conditions for its users. The facility functions as an elementary school and community center, se rving students and residents of the North End Community. EPA collaborated with stakeholders, including departments within the City of Springfield and community -based groups, to perform an HIA. The purpose of this HIA was to provide valuable health -focused information to help the City of Springfield narrow down and prioritize those renovation actions that best addressed the existing environmental conditions and reduced the potential negative health impacts to students, faculty, staff, and community members w ho use the facility. The HIA also provided an avenue for the community and other stakeholders to be engaged in the decision- making process. Community stakeholders had raised concerns related to Gerena School, which included indoor air quality issues relate d to motor vehicle emissions, flooding, moisture, mold, and other indoor environment conditions. The HIA utilized on -site observations, reviewed evidence, and professional expertise to judge each of the proposed renovation options for potential impacts to respiratory health. Based on the predicted impacts to health, the HIA provided recommendations for renovation actions that -10- aim to maximize potential benefits to health and mitigate and/or avoid potential adverse impacts to health. The executive summary for this case study is available at https://www.epa.gov/healthresearch/gerena -school Restoration Project (Duluth, MN): This project informed the MN Department of Natural Resources and the City of Duluth decisions on design and implementation of habitat restoration and park improvement projects at two sites along the St. Louis River in Duluth, Kingsbury Bay and Grassy Point. It evaluated the potential health impacts, specifically, seven pathways were identified and prioritized by stakeholders: water quality and habitat; equipment operation, traffic and transport; air quality; noise and light pollution' crime and safety; recreation, aesthetics, and engagement with nature; and social/cultural aspects. The HIA concluded that the proposed projects will have positive and negative health impacts, and that the net impacts are expected t o be positive. Impacts include improved water quality and aquatic habitat, reductions in crime from improved green spaces, increased opportunity for recreation, and access to cultural resources, among other things. The HIA also included recommendations to enhance the positive health impacts and reduce the negative health impacts, some of which were adopted by the decision makers. The HIA Project Team consisted of EPA staff, contractors, research fellows, and local professional stakeholders (e.g., individual s from academia; community organizations; local, county and state government agencies; and environmental organizations). Members of the HIA Project Team served on the HIA Leadership Team, HIA Research Team, or both. The HIA Project Team conducted the HIA w ith input and guidance from an HIA Advisory Committee, made up of technical experts and representatives from several stakeholder groups. The executive summary for this case study is available at https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2021- 09/kingsbury- bay-grassy - point -hia-summary -report.pdf . 2.

The awards for selected projects will be in the form of cooperative agreements because the EJG2G program requires substantial involvement and interaction between the applicant and EPA. EPA will negotiate the precise terms and conditions of \"substantial involvement\" as part of the award process. Federal involvement may include: close monitoring of the recipient's performance to verify the results proposed by the applicant; collaboration during the performance of the scope of work; in accordance with 2 CFR 200.325, as appropriate, review of proposed procurements; reviewing qualifications of key personnel; and/or review and comment on the content of printed or electronic publications or reports prepared although recipients will make the final decisions on the content of documents . EPA does not have the authority to select employees or contractors employed by the recipient. All subawards must be consistent with EPA's Subaward Policy and EPA does not select subrecipients. In appropriate circumstances, EPA reserves the right to partially fund applications by funding discrete portions of the proposed projects. If EPA decides to partially fund an application, it will do so in a manner that does not prejudice any applicant or a ffect the basis upon which the application was evaluated and selected for award, thereby maintaining the integrity of the competition and selection process. EPA also reserves the right to make additional awards under this RFA, consistent with Agency policy and guidance, if additional funding becomes available after the original selections are made. Any additional selections for awards will be made no later than 6 months after the original selection decisions . C. SET ASIDES EPA plans to award funding under this competition under specific set -asides. T here will be a separate ranking list developed under this competition for each of the set -aside s detailed below: State -Approximately $ 20M of annual appropriations funds is set aside for awards to states (includes the District of Columbia) and instrumentalities of state s (see section III.A ) under the -15- authority of EPA's Fiscal Year 2022 Act5. The dollar amount intended for these awards may be adjusted depending upon the quality of applications received and other relevant considerations. Trib al -Approximately $20M of CAA 138 IRA funds is set aside for awards to federally recognized tribal governments who partner with CBOs as required by CAA 138(b)(3)(A) . The dollar amount intended for these awards may be adjusted depending upon the quality of applications received and other relevant considerations Local Government -A pproximately $20M of CAA 138 IRA funds is set aside for awards to local governments who partner with CBOs as required by CAA 138(b)(3)(A) . The dollar amount intended for these awards may be adjusted depending upon the quality of applications received and other relevant considerations. U.S. Territory, Freely Associated State, Puerto Ric o, State Recognized Tribal Government, and Remote Tribal Government - Approximately $10M of annual appropriations funds is set aside for awards to U.S. Territories, Freely Associated States (FAS), Puerto Rico, state recognized tribal governments, and tribe s in remote areas of the United States (federally recognized or state recognized) . The dollar amount intended for these awards may be adjusted depending upon the quality of applications received and other relevant considerations. Tribes located in Remote Areas (federally recognized or state recognized) are a subset of the special consideration for rural areas (see Section I.E) and are defined as tribal governments located in rural areas with limited or no access to CBOs to partner with. R emote areas may also be characterized by limited access to public or private resources commonly found in metropolitan areas. NOTE - tribal governments that claim this remote status and limited access to community - based nonprofit partners must explain why they qualify for remote status. Tribes that qualify as remote will be placed in the U.S. Territory, Freely Associated States, Puerto Rico , state recogni zed tribal government, and remote tribal government track where approximately $10 million will be available. However, federally recognized tribal governments that are able to partner with at least one CBO will be placed in the Tribal track featuring $20 mi llion of IRA funding. EPA encourages tribal governments that can partner with a CBO to do so to access the track with the larger funding amount. Note that tribes that apply in partnership with CBOs cannot also apply for funding as a remotely located tribal government. D. PROJECT PERIOD The estimated project period for awards resulting from this solicitation is three years, from December 2023 to November 2026. Applicants should plan for projects to start on December 1, 2023. NOTE: Due to the restrictions in CAA 138(b)(1), EPA cannot extend the performance periods for E JG2G assistance agreements beyond three years. III.

The term State encompasses instrumentalities of state government as provided in 2 CFR 200.1 with the exception of state institutions of higher education.6 (2) a partnership between * \u2014 a federally recognized tribal government and a CBO (3) a partnership between* \u2014 a local government (as defined by 2 CFR 200.1 - includes cities, towns, municipalities, and counties , public housing authorities and councils of government ) and a CBO (4) Puerto Rico (5) U.S. Territories - includes territorial and local governmental entities in American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (6) Freely Associated States (FAS) - includes state and local governmental entities in the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Palau (7) Tribal governments in remote areas (as defined in Section II.C of this RFA) (8) State recognized tribal governments * NOTE: The term CBO is defined in Section I.A of the RFA. In addition, the partnership must be documented with a signed Letter of Commitment from the CBO detailing the parameters of the partnership, as well as the role and responsibilities of the community -based organization. See further details about partnerships below. Requirements of a Threshold Eligibility Qualifying CBO Partnership - For the purposes of the Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants programs authorized by section 138 of the Clean Air Act that are covered by this RFA, a \"partnership\" is a formal relationship between a state, federally recognized tribal government, or local government and a CBO that is memorialized in writing and is legally binding under applicable law. This requirement does not apply to state recognized tribes, FAS, U.S. territories, Puerto Rico, and remote tribal governments (federally recognized or state recognized). The qualifying partnership agreement must be signed by both parties and specify which member of the partnership will enter into the assistance agreement with EPA for the purposes of accountability for the proper expenditure of federal funds and receipt of the funds from EPA, performance of the assistance agreement, liability for claims for recovery of unallowable costs 6 Although under section 138(b)(3)(A) partnerships between institutions of higher education and CBOs are eligible entities, for policy reasons EPA is limiting eligibility for this RFA to partnerships between units of government and CBOs. Note that this limitation applies to institutions of higher education that are agencies and instrumentalities of state or tribal governments such as state universities and tribal colleges under this RFA . -17- incurred under the agreement and must specify roles in performing the proposed scope of work for the assistance agreement. For purposes of this RFA, the direct recipient of the EPA funds must be the state, local, or federally recognized trib al government partner and the CBO(s) partners must receive the funds from the direct recipient as subawards. Thus, a qualifying partnership must include a subaward agreement from the direct recipient of EPA funds to the partnering CBO(s). Additionally, Le tters of Commitment from the partnering CBO(s) must indicate a subaward agreement is planned to establish the partnership. The qualifying partnership agreement must also at a minimum specify other roles and responsibilities of each partner, including how t he priority environmental and public health issues of the disadvantaged communities being served by the partnership are identified and selected for projects and activities, as well as the role of community leaders in the decision -making processes and imple mentation of the proposed projects for funding. NOTE - Applicants are not required to include the qualifying partnership agreement as a part of their workplan but must include the necessary details as expressed above for the expected subaward(s) between th e direct recipients of EPA funds and the partnering CBO(s). If a non - financial relationship exists between entities (e.g., in -kind support on the project), then a letter of commitment explaining the non- financial relationship is sufficient. Letters of C ommitment - Applicants should include signed letters of commitment from the partnering CBOs (and entities from other stakeholder groups) that provide detailed information about the partnership agreement (e.g., roles and responsibilities ), including information about the planned subaward (if applicable) . Only partnerships that include a signed letter of commitment will be considered valid partnerships during the evaluation of your application. Please do not include generic letters of support. A generic letter of support will not count as a valid letter of commitment. EPA strongly encourages EJ G2G projects to include at least three partners from three different stakeholder groups Nonprofit Organization Definition - For the purposes of the \"nonprofit organization\" requirement for qualifying as a CBO consistent with the definition of Nonprofit organization at 2 CFR 200.1, the term \"nonprofit organization means any corporation, trust, association, cooperative, or other organization that is operated mainly for scientific, educational, service, charitable, or similar purpose in the public interest and is not organized primarily for profit; and uses net proceeds to maintain, improve, or expand the operation of the organization. Eligible nonprofit organizations may, but are not required to be, exempt from taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code. Workforce Investment Boards and organized Labor Unions that meet these criteria may be eligible community -based nonprofit organizations.

Partnerships and collaboration with other interested stakeholders in performance of the project are integral to the success of this program. If an applicant is eligible without partners and does not demonstrate such partnerships or collaboration as described above, they must be able to convincingl y demonstrate in their application how they can effectively perform the project without any partners or collaboration. All letters of commitment for required partnerships with CBOs as well as other types of collaborative partnerships must be submitted by the applicant with its application package by the submission deadline. The letters of commitment must be included as other attachments in the grants.gov application package (Section IV.A) and are not subject to the 18- page workplan limit. The letters must be submitted by the applicant with the other application documents by the submission deadline. The letters of commitment should include information about the role and activities each partner or stakeholder organization will perform as well as any resources the partner or stakeholder will provide. The letters of commitment must be signed by the partnering organizations. Do not include generic letters of support or recommendation. Regardless -26- of the source, generic letters of support will not be c onsidered in evaluating applications. Partnerships and collaborations that are not supported by letters of commitment will not be included in the evaluation of the application . If no letters of commitment are included, then it will be assumed the applicant has no partners and they must demonstrate how they can effectively perform the project without partners or collaboration. For-profit organizations are not eligible for subawards under this grant program but may receive procurement contracts. Any contracts for services or products funded with EPA financial assistance must be awarded under the competitive procurement procedures of 2 CFR Part 200 and/or 2 CFR Part 1500, as applicable. The regulations at 2 CFR 1500.10 contain limitations on the extent to which EPA funds may be used to compensate individual consultants. Refer to the Best Practice Guide for Procuring Services, Supplies, and Equipment Under EPA Assistance Agreements for guidance on competitive procurement requirements and consultant compensation. Do not name a procurement contractor (including a consultant) as a \"partner\" or otherwise in your application unless the contractor has been selected in compliance with competitive procurement requirements. Note a lso that competitive procurement requirements apply to contracts entered into prior to or after selection for award even if you do not name a contractor as a partner. Additionally, potential contractors who assist with preparing requests for proposals, qu otations of similar documents (including providing sample procurement documents) must be excluded from competing for the procurement as required by 2 CFR 200.319. Note: If you intend to fund a named or unnamed partner's participation in the project your a pplication must describe how the proposed financial transaction complies with applicable requirements in 2 CFR Part 200, EPA's Subaward Policy, the Best Practice Guide for Procuring Services, Supplies, and Equipment Under EPA Assistance Agreements or EPA G uidance on Participant Support Costs . Note that naming a contractor (including a consultant) as a \"partner\" does not relieve the applicant from complying with competitive procurement requirements . EPA does not accept sole source contract justifications for professional services (including environmental consulting services and consulting services on preparing grant applications) that are available in the commercial marketplace. 2.0 Project Activi ties / Milestone Schedule / Detailed Budget Narrative Please describe the following: a.

Applicants should describe how they plan to track and monitor their project performance and progress throughout the project period. Applicants will be evaluated on the extent and quality to which the application demonstrates a sound plan for tracking progress towards achieving the expected outputs, outcomes, and associated timeframes for achieving those results. You will be evaluated on your approach for determining how and whether progress is made in achieving the expected project outcomes and outputs and how your project will achieve these results. c. Sustainability Plan and Environmental Justice Integration - Based on your project planning with underserved communities and other partners, describe how your organization plans to utilize the results and momentum of the proposed project to further integrate environmental justice principles in all operations of State and/or local government work. 4.0 Programmatic Capability In order to be evaluated under this criterion in Section V, applicants must provide information on their: a. Organizational Experience related to the proposed project and their plan for building relationships with underserved communities, community groups, and vulnerable populations to successfully perform the project b. Staff Experience / Qualifications of Project Manager (PM) - Provide in formation that clearly demonstrates that the proposed PM and other staff associated with the project are qualified to perform the project successfully. This will be determined through the description of the following: - Why the PM and associated staff are q ualified to undertake the projec t - Illustrating the PM's experience building relationships with community residents and community organizations in a professional capacity. Please include detailed descriptions of similar activities and programs that the PM has worked onto improve local communities c. Expenditure of Awarded Grant Funds - Applicants will be evaluated based on their approach, procedures, and controls for ensuring that awarded grant funds will be expended in a timely and efficient manner and ap plicants must describe this in the workplan. -28- 5.0 Past Performance Submit a list of federally and/or non -federally funded assistance agreements (assistance agreements include Federal grants and cooperative agreements but not Federal contracts) similar in size and scope to the proposed project that your organization performed within the last three years (no more than 5 agreements, and preferably EPA agreements) and describe (i) whether, and how, you were able to successfully complete and manage t hose agreements and (ii) your history of meeting the reporting requirements under those agreements including whether you adequately and timely reported on your progress towards achieving the expected outputs and outcomes of those agreements (and if not, explain why not) and whether you submitted acceptable final technical reports under the agreements. In evaluating applicants under these factors in Section V, EPA will consider the information provided by the applicant and may also consider relevant informat ion from other sources, including information from EPA files and from current/prior grantors (e.g., to verify and/or supplement the information provided by the applicant). If you do not have any relevant or available past performance or past reporting information, please indicate this in the application and you will receive a neutral score for these factors (a neutral score is half of the total points available in a subset of possible points). If you do not provide any response for these items, you may rece ive a score of 0 for these factors. 6.0 Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) Information (If applicable) Please describe the following: Indicate whether you believe that your project will involve the use of existing environmental data or information or the collection of new data (use the checklist in Appendix F to assist you in making this determination). For more information about Qualit y Assurance Project Plans, please consult the following website https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015 -06/documents/g5 -final.pdf . You are not required to develop a QAPP at this point. You are only being asked to determine whether you will need a QAPP should your project be selected for funding. If required, then an approved QAPP must be in place prior to the initiation of project activities related to environment al data collection or use . 7.0 Other Attachments Form s a. Itemized Budget Sheet (Template available in Appendices E and F): Provide a detailed budget and estimated funding amount for each project component/activity. Identify the requested federal dollars. Keep in mind that EPA reserves the right to partially fund applications by funding discrete portions of the proposed projects . Clearly explain how EPA funds will be used. Applicants must itemize costs related to personnel, fringe benefits, contractual costs, travel, equipment, supplies, other direct costs, indirect costs, and total costs in their EPA budget request . All subaward funding should be located under the \"other\" category. This section provides an opportunity for narrative description of the budget or aspects of the budget such as \"other\" and contractual. Provide itemized costs with sufficient detail for EP A to determine the reasonableness and allowability of costs for each workplan -29- component/activity. Where necessary, your itemized budget sheet should include a budget narrative to make it clear how you determined/calculated the costs for each budget categor y. Please note that applicants that intend to use EPA funds for construction must include the estimated costs for construction contracts in the \"Construction\" line item and estimated costs for architectural and engineering services in the \"Contractual\" lin e item in the detailed budget sheet and the SF 424 A form. In accordance with 2 CFR 200.414(f), recipients that do not have a current negotiated indirect cost rate under 10% are eligible for a de minimis rate of 10% of modified total direct costs for all Federal awards . Please as provided in 2 CFR 200.332 subrecipients who do not have current negotia ted indirect cost rates may also use the 10% rate but that applicants may not force subrecipients to use the 10% rate rather than their negotiated rate. Total estimated costs in the itemized budget template should r eflect federal funding only. Applicants are permitted to attach the itemized budget template as an \"Other Attachment\" to their application and it will not count against the 18- page workplan limit. Applicants will not be penalized if they choose not to use the budget template. b. Environ mental Results / Logic Model Applicants will be evaluated on the quality of the expected project outputs and outcomes identified in the application for their project. The expected outputs and outcomes should be effective in achieving the Program Objectives listed in Section I, including developing strategies for addressing local environmental and public health issues, as well as building consensus and setting community priorities in the underserved community. Applicants are permitted to attach their complet ed logic models as an \"Other Attachment\" to their applications so the sheet will not count against the 1 8-page workplan limit. While not required, including a logic model as part of your application package is strongly encouraged. A logic model is a useful tool in developing output and outcome measures. It is a visual illustration that shows the relationship between your work and your desired results. Applicants may use the logic model template provided in the appendices or use/create one of their own likin gs. If you choose not to provide a logic model, you must still detail the outputs and outcomes of your project and address how you will measure performance. (Logic model template and example are available in Appendices B, C, & D). When developing output s and outcomes for all projects, it is important to consider the following: - What are the measurable short term and longer term results the project will achieve? - How will my project measure progress in achieving the expected results (including outputs and outcomes) and how will the approach use resources effectively and efficiently? -30- - Are the projected outputs and outcomes specific and detailed? Did I include specific target measures where possible? Are my target measures reasonable and achievable within the project period and for the funding amount? c. Letters of Commitment from Partners (representing at least three stakeholder groups): Letters of commitment should include information about the role and activities each partner or stakeholder organization will perform as well as any resources the partner or stakeholder will provide. The letters of commitment must be signed by the partnering organizations. Do not include generic letters of support or recommendation. Regardless of the source, generic letters of support will not be considered in evaluating applications. The Letters of Commitment are not subject to the 1 8-page limit. Note: A partnership with a CBO is required for states, local governments, and federally recognized tribes. This counts as one stakeholder group. d. Resumes of the Project Manager (PM) and Other Key Personnel: Applicants must attach a resume or curricula vitae (CV) for the PM and other key personnel named on the Key Contacts List. These are not subject to the workplan page limit although individual resumes should not exceed 2 pages in length. 8.0 Intergovernmental Review Act Executive Order 12372 , (For projects proposing construction and/or land use planning activities) NOTE - Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs may be applicable to awards resulting from this announcement.

Disproportionate Environmental Applications will be evaluated on how clearly they describe the local environmental justice issue(s), underserved 12 -33- and Public Health Issues Impacting Underserved Communities communities, and vulnerable populations the project proposes to address and the communit ies that are impacted. Applicants will be evaluated based on the e xtent and quality to which they (maximum 4 points each ): (1) Describe and characterize the underserved communities and vulnerable populations directly impacted by disproportionate environmental and/or public health issues and describe how those communities and populations are impacted by those issues (2) Describe the local environmental/public health iss ue(s) that the project seeks to address? Describe other recent efforts in the State, if any, that have sought to address those issues as well (3) Describe the local environmental/public health results the project seeks to achieve and how will the unders erved communities and vulnerable populations benefit from those results? * The application must include relevant information such as demographics, geographic location, and community history. We encourage the use of EPA's EJSCREEN tool and/or local screening and mapping tools to further help character ize and describe your target communities. Instructions and resources on how to use EJSCREEN are included at the hyperlink above. For any questions you have about EJSCREEN, please contact Tai Lung at Lung.Tai@epa.gov or 202- 566-1296. c. Organization's Recent Efforts to Directly Support Underserved Communities The application will be evaluated on the extent and quality to which it demonstrates the strength of its efforts over the last five years to provide direct support and build relationships with underserved communities and vulnerable populations involved with the proposed project. Applications will be evaluated based the extent and quality to which it addresses the following (maximum 4 points each ): (1) Recent Efforts (within the last five years) that the applicant's organization has made to provide direct support and build relationships with the underserved communities and vulnerable populations identified in your application, including the duration of involvement and circumstances that led to your organization's involvement. Examples may include, development of new housing assistance programs, community wo rkshops and public meetings, environmental justice programming, and neighborhood planning. 12 -34- (2) How the applicant organization has worked directly with community residents and/or CBOs of underserved communities to address local environmental and public he alth issues within the last five years and what are some of the results of that work . (3) How the residents were part of the decision -making process of past efforts. How those efforts increased capacity and resources for underserved communities to address public health and/or environmental issues. And, how the applicant maintained an ongoing relationship with those communities and populations . d. Project Linkages The application will be evaluated on the extent and quality to which it : (1) Supports EPA Strategic Plan Goal 2 ( Take Decisive Action to Advance Environmental Justice and Civil Rights ), Objective 2. 1 (Promote Environmental Justice and Civil Rights at the Federal, Tribal, State, and Local Levels ) (2 point s) Refer to link Below: https://www.epa.gov/planandbudget/strategicplan 2 e. Partner and Collaborate Under this criterion, applications will be evaluated on the following sub criteria: a. The quality and extent to which the applicant provides a clear and concise description of how the proposed project promotes collaborations with partners from multiple stakeholder groups, such as CBOs, industry, business, academia, government, etc., to deve lop and implement solutions that will address environmental and/or public health issues at the local level. Under this criterion, EPA will evaluate : - planned roles of each partner listed on the Project Summary Page - how each partner will contribute to t he project, - what resources each partner brings to the project - how the partner has a vested interest in working with this partnership (other than just getting income from a sub-award or contract) - how the applicant organization plans to sustain these relationships on into the future (5 points) Eligible applicants who do not propose partnerships or collaboration with others will be evaluated based on how well they demonstrate that they can effectively 10 -35- and efficiently perform the project without any collaborating partners. b. Letters of Commitment. Applica tions will be evaluated based on the quality of the letters of commitment submitted with the application. Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit at least three letters of commitment from three partners from three different stakeholder groups. The lette rs should explain the partners' role in the project, what resources (funding, in- kind, technical assistance, etc.) they are bringing to the effort, and their interest in the project and community. Generic letters of support will not be evaluated. Submittin g fewer than three letters of commitment from three different stakeholder groups may negatively impact an applicant's score under this criterion. (5 points) NOTE: Only partnerships supported by a commitment letter will be evaluated using the above sub criteria. Partnerships with no commitment letters will not be evaluated. Partnerships and collaboration with other interested stakeholders in performance of the project are integral to the success of this program. If an applicant does not demonstrate such partnerships or collaboration as described in Section IV, applications will be evaluated on how well they demonstrate in their application that they can effectively perform the project without any partners or collaboration. Given the nature of this program, failure to demonstrate effective partnerships or collaboration with other stakeholders or having fewer partners/collaboration than recommended above, will likely adversely impact the applicant's scoring under this criterio n and render the application less competitive than others that include partnerships and collaboration. If an application has no commitment letters and does not demonstrate how the applicant can effectively perform the project without partners or collaborat ion, they may receive a zero for this criterion. 2.0 Project Activities/ Milestone Schedule/ Detailed Budget Narrative Under this criterion, applications will be evaluated based on the extent and quality to which they demonstrate the following: 28 a. Project activities Clearly identified steps that the applicant will take that will reasonably progress towards achieving the program objectives and a clear description of the detailed project activities or components and the anticipated products/results associated with each activity as described in Section IV. 12 b. Milestone schedule A clearly articulated and realistic milestone schedule, 4 -36- including timeframes and major milestones to complete significant project activities. It is recommended that you insert a table in your application narrative to help organize your milestone schedule c. Itemized Budget Sheet / Budget Narrative Reasonable and allowable costs for each component/activity. Applicants must itemize costs into the following budget categories: personnel, fringe benefits, contractual costs, travel, equipment, supplies, other direct costs, indirect costs, and total costs . Describe itemized costs in sufficient detail for EPA to evaluate the reasonableness and allowability of costs for each workplan component/activity. ( 6 points) EPA funding awarded to partnering CBOs . Applica tions will be evaluated on the percentage of the total funds proposed to be awarded to the applicant that are to be subawarded to partnering CBOs . Applicants are strongly encouraged to budget a minimum of 20% of their proposed budget for partnering CBOs. For example, for a $1M award , a minimum of $200,000 would be budgeted for partnering CBOs. Subaward funds should be accounted for in the \"Other Costs\" budget category. ( 6 points) Applicants are permitted to submit the itemized budget sheet using the \"Other Attachment\" form so the sheet will not count against the 18- page workplan limit. 12 3.0 Environmental Results \u2014Outcomes, Outputs and Performance Measures (Logic Model) - Under this criterion, applications will be evaluated on the following elements : 18 a. Environmental Results-Outputs/Outcomes The extent and quality to which t he expected project outputs and outcomes identified in the application are demonstrated to be effective in achieving the Program Objectives listed in Section I, including developing strategies for addressing local environmental and public health issues, educating and empowering the community about those issues, and developing approaches to building consensus and setting community priorities in the underserved community. 10 b. Performance Measurement Plan The extent and quality to which the application demonstrates a sound plan for tracking progress towards achieving the expected outputs, outcomes, and associated timeframes for achieving those results. 4 c.

Organizational experience Organizational experience related to the proposed project, and plan for building rela tionships with underserved communities, community groups, and vulnerable populations to successfully perform the project. 4 b. Staff Experience / Qualifications of Project Manager (PM) The applicant will be evaluated on the ability to clearly demonstrate that the selected PM and other staff associated with the project are qualified to successfully perform the project. This will be determined through evaluating the following: (1) How the PM and staff are qualified to undertake the project successfully; (2 points) (2) Illustrating the PM's experience building relationships with community residents and community organizations in a professional capacity. Please include detailed descriptions of simil ar activities and programs that the PM has worked onto improve local communities (2 points) (3) 4 c. Expenditure of Awarded Grant Funds Under this criterion, applicants will be evaluated based on their approach, procedures, and controls for ensuring that awarded grant funds will be expended in a timely and efficient manner. 2 5.0 Past Performance Under this criterion, applicants will be evaluated based on their ability to successfully complete and manage the proposed project taking into account their: (i) past performance in successfully completing and managing the assistance agreements identified in response to Section IV of the solicitation (3 points) , (ii) history of meeting the reporting requirements under the assistance agreements identified in response to Section IV of the solicitation including whether the applicant submitted acceptable final technical reports under those agreements and the extent t o which the applicant adequately and timely reported on their progress towards achieving the expected outputs and outcomes under those agreements and if such progress was not being made whether the applicant adequately reported why not (3 points) . Note: In evaluating applicants under this criterion, the Agency will consider the information provided by the applicant and may also consider relevant information 6 -38- from other sources including agency files and prior/current grantors (e.g., to verify and/or suppl ement the information supplied by the applicant). If you do not have any relevant or available past performance or past reporting information, please indicate this in the application and you will receive a neutral score for these subfactors (items i and ii above -a neutral score is half of the total points available in a subset of possible points). If you do not provide any response for these items, you may receive a score of 0 for these factors . B. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS Applications will be reviewed and scored under the following process: 1. Threshold Eligibility Screening Process - All applications will be evaluated for eligibility using the threshold eligibility criteria described in Section III.C by EPA Office of Environmental Just ice and External Civil Rights (OEJECR) staff. 2. Panel Review and Evaluation Process - EPA will convene a review panel(s) to review, score, and rank all eligible applications that pass the threshold eligibility review based on the merit evaluation criteria listed above in separate ranking list s for each of the set -aside categories described in Section II . The review panel(s) will include EPA staff and may include external subject matter experts. 3. Final Selection Process and Other Factors - The review panel will present f inal rankings and selection recommendations to the Selection Official, who will then make the final selections for award in each set -aside category. In addition to this information, the Selection Official may also consider any of the following \"other factors\" in making final selection decisions from among the high- ranking applications : Projects addressing Climate Change, Disaster Resiliency, Health Impact Assessments, Rural Areas, and/or Emergency Preparedness. Geographic Diversity - EPA may consider the mix of high -ranking projects located in urban and rural areas or different regions of the country when making final selections, as well as the geographical nature or impact of the project. Programmatic Priorities - OEJECR, EPA National Programs, and Regional Offices develop annual goals and priorities that may focus on certain environmental and/or public health issues ( e.g., lead contamination, safe drinking water, and risk management). These overarching goals and priorities may be a consideration when making final selections among high- ranking applications . Availabili ty of funds Accordingly, in making the final funding decisions, the S election O fficial will consider the review panel rankings and recommendations, OEJ ECR staff input based on their call with the review panel(s) and may also consider the other factors identified above . The \"other factors\" may only be considered by the S election O fficial when determining final selections after the scoring and ranking process is complete. -39- C.

REPORTING Progress Report. The Project Manager will be required to submit semi- annual progress reports for the duration of the agreement to update the EPA Regional Project Officer and will also be required to have quarterly meetings with the EPA Regional Project Officer. Final Report Requirement. The Project Manager must submit a Final Technical Report for EPA approval within 120 days after the end of the project period. A draft of this report should be submitted within sixty (60) days after the end of the project period. A Financial Status Report is also required and will be described in the award agreement. The EPA may collect, review, and disseminate those final reports that can serve as models for future projects. Many applicants may find it useful to document their progress using various media. This may include, but not limited to the use of videos, blogs, and other forms of social media. Post-Project Period Follow -up and Engagement For no less than one year after completion of the project, recipients agree to provide semi -annual updates to their designated EPA Project Officer on current community -based and environmental justice work the recipient is performing and how/if that work re lates to their now completed EJG2G project. These semi -annual updates may include (but are not limited to) recent local media reports, additional grant funding received, new initiatives, and developing partnerships. The EPA EJ Grants program is invested in the long- term success of each EJ Grant recipient and their long - term impact on addressing the disproportionate environmental and public health impacts plaguing their communities. These post -project period updates allow the EJ Grants program to provide past recipients with additional guidance about applicable funding opportunities, potential collaborations, and technical assistance that may assist recipients in their future work*. The periodic updates also allow the program to track best practices that lead to greater project sustainability and long- term community revitalization for impacted community residents. Recipients are strongly encouraged to continue providing updates and engaging with their EPA Project Officer beyond the additional year after the end of the project. *NOTE - Compliance with this term & condition will not give the recipient priority during future EPA EJ grant competitions and is not a guarantee for future EPA grant funding. Justice40 Reporting The activities to be performed under the awards are expected to contribute to the President's goal that 40% of the overall project benefits flow to disadvantaged communities ( the Justice40 Initiative - See Section I.A) . Recipients , therefore, will be expected to report on cert ain metrics to demonstrate to what extent the activities contribute to the 40% goal. The award will include appropriate terms and conditions to this effect. -41- Signage The activities to be performed under the awards are expected to publicize that they were f unded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Inflation Reduction Act (e.g., via signs at the place(s) of performance. The award will include appropriate terms and conditions to this effect. EJ Grantee Training Workshops (Virtual and in -person options) During the three -year project period, all EJG2G recipients will be required to attend a number of EJ Grantee Networking and Training Workshops facilitated by EPA Headquarters or the nearest EPA regional office. These workshops may be hosted, coordinated, and/or facilitated by the Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Technical Assistance Centers (EJ TCTACs) awarded under assistance listing 66.309. The purpose of the training and networking workshops are to: 1) connect current EJ grant recipients with past recipients and community partners, 2) assist all community stakeholders with strategic planning for their communities, 3) facilitate grantees accessing additional resources and 4) provide general project management and federal grant guidance. Frequency of workshops attendance is subject to change and will be determined by EPA. EJ Grant Applicant Database The EJ grant program strives to support as many community- based organizations that apply to our EJ grant opportunities as possible, regardless of their ultimate success in receiving a grant, by 1) familiarizing applicants with federal grant application requirements, 2) sharing expectations and responsibilities of managing federal grants, 3) providing constructive feedback and recommendations on ways to strengthen unselected applications, 4) helping organizations build sustainability into projects so they continue to grow and develop after the project period is over, and 5) facilitating connections with other potential resource s that can help organizations address community needs. To facilitate the achievement of these immediate goals, all applicants who apply to this opportunity will be added to our EJ Grant Applicant Database. The database helps the Environmental Justice progr am identify and work with additional underserved communities outside the context of our grant awards. Quality Assurance Project Plans (QAPP) Quality assurance is sometimes applicable to assistance projects (see 2 CFR 1500.12 and the EPA Environmental Information Quality Policy CIO 2105.2 ). Quality assurance requirements apply to the collection and/or use of environmental data and information. Environmental data are any m easurements or information that describe environmental processes, location, or conditions; ecological or health effects and consequences; or the performance of environmental technology. Environmental data include information collected directly from measure ments, produced from models, and compiled from other sources, such as databases or literature. Once the award is made, if a Quality Assurance Project Plan is required for the project, the applicant will have to draft a QAPP prior to beginning work on the project activities related to environmental data collection or information . You must reserve time and financial resources in the beginning of your project in order to prepare your QAPP and include the cost for developing your QAPP in your Detailed Budget. S elected applicants cannot begin data collection until EPA approves the QAPP. D. COMPETITION DISPUTE RESOLUTION Assistance agreement competition -related disputes will be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures published in 70 FR (Fe deral Register) 3629, 3630 (January 26, 2005) which can be found at Grant Competition Dispute Resolution Procedures . Please note that the FR notice references regulations at 40 CFR Parts 30 and 31 that have been superseded -42- by regulations in 2 CFR parts 200 and 1500.

Please read the Application Guidance carefully -- this document is intended for informational purposes only. Target your audience carefully Identify a specific group or community to work with to develop a program that will give the highest return for your dollars invested. Build partnerships and alliances You are strongly encouraged to enlist project involvement from community groups with similar or related goals and secure their commitment of services and/or dollars. Be sure to document this by obtaining letter(s) of commitment for your application. Initiate the partnerships early in your planning since building alliances can take time and effort. Do some homework Allow time to develop and document your understanding of environmental justice issues within the community you work in or with. Find out what materials exist on the subject and the procedures you are planning to include in your workplan. Use this information to back up your project plans or to explain how your group activities are unique and/or creative. Develop a project evaluation technique Define as carefully and precisely as possible what you want to achieve with this project and how you will test its success. Ask yourself: \"what do you expect to be different once the project is complete?\" Outline a plan you will use to measure the success of your activities/project. Develop a timeline or project accomplishment schedule List the major tasks that you will complete to meet the goals of the project. Break these broad goals into smaller tasks and lay them out in a schedule over the twelve months of the grant period. Determine and identify in the application the total estimated cost for each task. You may estimate this cost by the number of personnel, materials, and other resources you will need to carry out the tasks. Stay within the format and follow application instructions including any page limits This makes it easier for the reviewer to read and therefore, understand your workplan . Please refer to the application requirements. Communicate the nature of your project accurately, precisely, and concisely.

The foundation of a healthy community is strongest when built upon a decision -making process that balances environmental, social, and economic factors to promote the health and well -being of its members. HIA is a tool designed to inves tigate how a proposed program, project, policy, or plan may impact health and well -being and inform decision-makers of these potential outcomes before the decision is made. HIAs: determine the potential effects of a proposed decision on the health of a pop ulation and the distribution of those effects within the population; consider input from stakeholders, including those impacted by the decision; use different types of qualitative and quantitative evidence and analytical methods; are flexible based on available time and resources; and provide evidence and recommendations to decision- makers in a timely manner. HIAs typically involve six steps ( North American HIA Practice Standards Working Group 2010; Bhatia 2011; National Research Council 2011; Human Impact Partners 2011, 2012; EPA, 2013 ). NOTE: It is strongly encouraged that selected applicants follow the steps below in conducting their HIA: 1. Screening - Determine whether an HIA is needed, and the value added. a. Define the decision and its alternatives; HIA is intended to inform a decision b. Assess the feasibility of conducting the HIA given the timeframe and available resources c. Determine willingness of partners to participate in the HIA and decision makers to receive recommendations from the HIA 2. Scoping - Identify which health effects to consider and set the HIA parameters. a. Determine who will conduct the HIA and plan for stakeholder involvement b. Examine st akeholder concerns and potential impacts of the decision on population health and the distribution of those effects across vulnerable groups. c. Determine methods and data sources for use in the assessment. 3. Assessment - Collect qualitative and quantitative in formation to create a profile of existing health conditions, and identify, evaluate, and prioritize the potential health impacts of the decision. a. Consider direction, magnitude, severity, likelihood, and distribution/equity of impacts. b. Describe data sources and methods, acknowledging assumptions, strengths, and limitations of the data and methods. c. Include documentation of stakeholder engagement. 4. Recommendations - Identify alternatives to the decision and/or strategies for promoting the positive health impac ts and/or mitigating the adverse health impacts. a. Develop, and consider prioritizing, recommendations to mitigate adverse health impacts. b. Develop an implementation plan for the recommendations, including who is responsible, timeline for implementation, ind icators for monitoring progress. 5. Reporting - Write a final report and communicate the results of the HIA to decisionmakers and other stakeholders for implementation/action. a. Develop a transparent and publicly accessible report to document the process, methods, findings, funding, and participants of the HIA. b. Communicate findings and recommendations to stakeholders and decision makers. 6. Monitoring and Evaluation - Evaluate the processes involved in the HIA, the impact of the HIA on the decision -making process, and the impacts of the decision on health. a. Perform a process evaluation to document and communicate how effective the HIA was in meeting its objectives and established practice standards. b. Perform an impact evaluation to document and communicate the impact of the HIA on the decision -making process. c. Perform an outcome evaluation to determine the accuracy of the health impacts predicted in the HIA when feasib le. Minimum Elements and Practice Standards for Health Impact Assessment Identifies eight essential elements for conducting com prehensive HIA that distinguish it from other processes used to assess and inform decisions. In addition to the eight elements below, this resource explains detailed practice standards for implementing HIAs . Note: It is strongly encouraged that applicants follow t hese minimum elements and practice standards. 1. HIA is conducted to assess the potential health consequences of a proposed program, policy, project, or plan under consideration by decision-makers, and is conducted in advance of the decision in quest ion. 2. HIA involves and engages stakeholders affected by the proposal, particularly vulnerable populations. 3. HIA systematically considers the full range of potential impacts of the proposal on health determinants, health status, and health equity. 4. HIA provides a profile of existing conditions for the populations affected by the proposal, including their health outcomes, health determinants, and vulnerable sub -groups within the population, relevant to the health issues examined in the HIA. 5. HIA characterizes the proposal's impacts on health, health determinants, and health equity, while documenting data sources and analytic methods, quality of evidence used, methodological assumptions, and limitations. 6. HIA provides recommendations, as needed, on feasible and effective actions to promote the positive health impacts and mitigate the negative health impacts of the decision, identifying, where appropriate, alternatives or modifications to the proposal. 7. HIA produces a publicly accessible report that includes, at minimum, documentation of the HIA's purpose, findings, and recommendations, and either documentation of the processes and methods involved, or reference to an external source of documentation for these processes and methods. The report should be shared with decision -makers and other stakeholders. 8. HIA proposes indicators, actions, and responsible parties, where indicated, for a plan to monitor the implementation of recommendations, as well as health effects and outcomes of the proposal.
