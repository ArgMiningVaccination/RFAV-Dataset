This milestone was met 42 days ahead of the 100-day goal. FEMA committed to providing all available resources to support our state, local, tribal and territorial partners in the ongoing effort to provide a vaccine to everyone who wanted. As the federal government worked to increase the supply of COVID-19 vaccines across the nation, FEMA took steps to build the infrastructure so it could adapt when vaccine supply was more readily available. Vaccination centers were established by state, local, tribal or territorial partners and may have received any combination of federal equipment, funding and personnel. These locations may vary in size and number of vaccinations they could administer in a day.

Visit [Vaccine.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/search/) to find your nearest vaccination center. Federal Pilot Community Vaccination Centers FEMA also partnered with state governments to launch a small number of large Type 1 and Type 2 federal pilot community vaccination centers (CVCs). The sites FEMA piloted were selected based on data analysis including the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index and other Census data as well as input from our state and local partners. Vaccines for these centers were provided to the states above and beyond the regular allocations. The additional vaccines were made possible through increases in production and availability. We worked to do the most good, for the most vulnerable populations, with no impact to the current allocations of vaccines to the states. Types of Community Vaccination Centers We provided support to established community vaccination centers to expand access to vaccines. Type 1: Approximately 6,000 vaccinations a day. Type 2: Approximately 3,000 vaccinations a day Type 3: Approximately 1,000 vaccinations a day Type 4: Approximately 250 vaccinations a day Type 5: Mobile Community Vaccination Centers Approximately 250 vaccinations a day FEMA and its partners developed innovative ways to deliver vaccines using mobile capabilities to bring the vaccine to the people who need it. In some cases, mobile vaccination centers were buses or recreational vehicles specially fitted for a vaccination operation. Mobile vaccination capabilities also included pop-up locations that could be set up in areas such as parking lots or serve as a temporary clinic in a community-owned building. Mobile vaccination centers could be moved daily or weekly to suit the needs of the community.
