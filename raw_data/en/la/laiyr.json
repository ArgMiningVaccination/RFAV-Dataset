You may be wondering what sound therapy is, so let me explain... Vibrational frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz) and everything in the universe vibrates at a specific frequency. This includes us! In the brain specifically, neurons fire at different frequencies based on information they receive from internal and external environments. As a rule, relatively stronger vibrations affect weaker ones. This is how sound waves can impact our brain waves and the vibrations in other systems in our bodies. If subjected to strong vibrational frequencies for an adequate amount of time, weaker frequencies in the body will begin to vibrate higher to match up with the stronger vibrations. The vagus nerve is the main parasympathetic nerve in the body, and during a sound bath it is stimulated by its connection to the tympanic membrane in the ear, which vibrates in response to sound waves. The vagus nerve plays a major role in hormone balance, blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose levels, inflammation, and digestion in the body. In a nutshell, healing can only happen in the body when you're in a parasympathetic (\"rest and digest\" or \"stay and play\") state. This is how crystal sound bowls & other sound healing instruments work their magic. Sound baths can shift brain waves, reducing fatigue and improving energy during the day, while deepening sleep at night. They have been shown to improve mood and reduce tension and anxiety. They can also reduce cortisol levels which in turn may improve hormone balance. Even your immune system benefits from an extended amount of time spent in the parasympathetic state! So, if this offering of healing is calling to you then please book with me. This healing will be held at my home in North Wales or within a space of your choosing. Love, light and blessings If the energy exchange is unaffordable but you feel you would benefit from this space, please reach out as we we are currently building a community fund for the women locally to enable us to offer free spaces & healings.

I am totally in awe of Laurie and her ability to make you feel comfortable and at ease as soon as you walk through her door. She greeted me with open arms ready to start the session. We started with a tea ceremony outside in the lush surroundings of her garden, peaceful and calm. We then moved indoors and begun with intention setting. I felt completely at ease and safe in Laurie's presence. She has this aura of love around her that seems to envelop you. Throughout the session I felt happy to follow her instruction and felt safe being guided by Laurie into a very constructive and emotional time. I feel I learned so much about my body and how to open myself up to my thoughts and feelings. I loved spending time with Laurie and have booked onto her retreat day too. Would wholeheartedly recommend Laurie as a practitioner to guide you through healing and finding that missing connection to yourself. Today, I experienced the Reiki and Crystal healing, Chakra balancing and Sound therapy that Laurie offers. From start to finish Laurie guided me, kept me calm and relaxed and took me on a healing adventure. It was absolutely magical and I didn't want it to end! I'm heavily pregnant so Laurie also helped me with my breath work - which was massively appreciated as I will use these techniques during labour too. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND purchasing this gorgeous 1:1 session as it's absolutely wonderful and not only does it heal you within, it's a gorgeous treat too! Thank you Laurie for your time and effort that you put into our session this morning. I "}
