General Information 2.1 History, Background and Mission of Campbell University On January 5, 1887, James Archibald Campbell welcomed 16 students to the first day of classes, thus marking the founding of Buies Creek Academy. Over the years, the Academy evolved to become Campbell College , Incorporated (1927), and Campbell University , Incorporated (1979). The mission of Campbell University is to graduate students with exemplary academic and professional skills who are prepared for purposeful lives and meaningful service. The University i s informed and inspired by its Baptist heritage and three basic theological and biblical presuppositions: learning is appointed and conserved by God as essential to the fulfillment of human destiny; in Christ all things consist and find ultimate unity; and the Kingdom of God in this world is rooted and grounded in Christian community. The University embraces the conviction there is no conflict between the life of faith and the life of inquiry. In 2013, Campbell launched the Jerry M. Wallace School of Oste opathic Medicine, North Carolina's first new m edical school in over 35 years. In August 2016, the Catherine W. Wood School of Nursing \u2014housed within the College of Pharmacy & Health Scie nces\u2014welcomed its first cohort. Simultaneously, Campbell opened its School of Engineering, which was only the second engineering school at a private university in North Carolina. They joined Campbell's other established colleges and schools: the College of Arts & Sciences, the Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law (1976), t he Lundy -Fetterman School of Business (1983), the School of Education (1985), the College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (1985), and the Divinity School (1996). In addition to its main campus in Buies Creek, Campbell University has off -campus instructional sites in Camp Lejeune (Jacksonville), Fort Bragg & Pope (Fayetteville), Raleigh (2009 relocation of the law school), Tunku Abdul Rahman University College (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia), Sampson Correctional Institution (Clinton), and a vibrant online pre sence through Campbell Online. Today, Campbell University enrolls approximately 7,000 students per year, including more than 5,000 undergraduate and graduate students on i ts main campus. The University employs over 900 full -time employees, which includes over 250 full -time faculty. Over 100 degree programs in the liberal arts, health sciences, fine arts , and professions are offered.

No rth Carolina h as the medic al facilities to provide sufficient training sit es for CUSOM medi cal students a nd the oppor tunity to d evelop new GME tr aining sit es to ensure gr aduates will h ave residency positions a vailable to them in No rth Carolina. 2.6 Osteopathic History The history of CUSOM b egins with the a dvent of osteop athy by Andr ew Taylor Still, a native of Virgini a. In 1854, D r. Still, then a pra cticing allopathic physician in Kansas, became inc reasingly dissa tisfied with the medic al practices of his day. He de veloped a new theory of m edicin e, which he called ost eopathy. He based his new approa ch to health care on the concepts of body unity, the body's inherent ability to hea l itself given all the optimum c onditions, and on the prop er alignment and function of the musculoskel etal system. CUSOM tak es pride in bringing the philosophi es of D r. Still to No rth Carolina. Ov er the years, the pra ctice of medicine h as evolved and so has the pra ctice of osteopa thic medi cine. Today, doc tors of osteop athic medi cine (D Os) serve the public with full medical practice privil eges. Ost eopathic physicia ns are trained in a ll the mode rn practices s cience has to of fer in medic al and surgic al care while in corpor ating the concept of tr eating the whole pe rson throughout the training. Ost eopathic physici ans believe hands-on examination (palpation) is an essential p art of making a physic al diagnosis. In a ddition to pha rmacologic tr eatment and surgery, manipulative medic ine remains an import ant the rapeutic tool utiliz ed by osteopa thic physicia ns in alleviating pain and tr eating illness. The tr aining of osteop athic physi cians has a lways stressed a primary care orientation. 19 Four Tenets of Osteopathic Med icine 1. The body is a uni t; the person is a unit of mind, body and spirit 2. The body is capable of self-regulation, self-healing, and he alth maintenance 3. Structure and function are reciprocally interrelated 4. Rational treatme nt is based on the above three principles 2.7 Osteopathic Oath I do he reby affirm my loy alty to the profe ssion I am about to e nter. I will be mindful always of my gre at responsibility to pres erve the he alth and the life of my pa tients, to retain their c onfide nce and resp ect both a s a physici an and a f riend who will gu ard their secrets with s crupulous honor a nd fid elity, to p erform faithfully my professiona l duti es, to employ only those re cogniz ed methods of tr eatm ent consistent with good judgment and with my skill a nd ability, ke eping in mind a lways n ature's la ws and the body's inherent capacity for re covery. I will be ever vigil ant in aiding in the ge neral welfare of the c ommunity, sust aining i ts laws and institutions, not engaging in those pra ctices, whi ch will in any way, bring shame or discr edit upon my pro fession or mys elf. I will give no drugs for deadly purpos es to any person, though it be asked of me. I will e ndeavor to wo rk in a ccord with my colleagues in a spirit of progressive cooperation and never by wo rd or by act c ast imput ations upon th em or their rightful practices. I will look with resp ect and esteem upon a ll those who ha ve taught me my art. To my college I will be loy al and strive a lways for its b est int erests and for the int erests of the students who will c ome after me. I will be e ver alert to fu rther the application of ba sic biologic truths to the h ealing arts a nd to velop the enunc iated by And rew T aylor Still. 20 3. Admission 3.1 Admissions Process CUSOM h as adopted admissions polici es and criteria designed to me et its Mission to educate and tr ain outst anding community -based osteopa thic physicia ns to c are for the rural and und erserved populations in No rth Carolina, the Southe astern United Stat es, and the na tion. CUSOM fa culty, st aff, and students va lue t eamwo rk, le adership, pro fession alism, integrity, dive rsity, and the ethical tre atment of all humanity. The guiding principles of the CUS OM Office of Admissions a re to: 1. Review each applicant as a whole person: Mind, Body, and Spirit. 2. Evaluate each applicant's potential for success in the Do ctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) curriculum. 3. Assess each applicant's commitme nt and aptitude as a future practicing osteopathic physician. 4. Consider each a pplicant's interest in serving rural and unde rserved popul ations . 5. Help confirm the a pplicant's commitm ent to the Mission of CUSOM and the osteopathic profession. The O ffice of Admissions ensures qua lified students a re selected for mat riculation to the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine Progr ell Univ ersity. CUSOM is commi tted to s electing applicants who align with our Mission and our v alues and who will be a n asset to the pro fession of osteopa thic medi cine. Wh en ations, the goals of the Of fice of Admissions include, but are not limited to, evaluating : Each a pplicant as a whole person. Each a pplicant's interest in serving rural and unde rserved popul ations . Each a pplicant's potential succes s as a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine. Each a pplicant's compassion, knowledge, and commitment to healthcare and the C USOM Mission. The CUSOM Admissions Commi ttee al Coll ege Admissions T est (MCAT) s cores, letters of re comm endation, he alth-related work and research and volunt eer exp erience. In addition to a cademic p erformance, the Admissions Committee pla ces emphasis on the ethical treatment of all humanity, the d emonstr ation of personal merit, compassion, community involve ment, skills, te amwo goa ls, and the promotion of dive rsity. 21 Faculty and staff evaluations provided after each candidate's interview are utilized by the Admissions Committee in making their recommendation to the Dean regarding whether the candidate should be granted or denied acceptance. The D ean conside rs the recommend ations f rom the committee before making the final d ecisio n on each candidate. The Dean, as the Chief Academic Officer, makes all final decisions on candidate status. The CUSOM Offi ce of Admissions maintains pre -admission academic and demogr aphic d ata for e ach mat riculating class. Upon gradua tion, the Of fice of the Registrar wo rks in conjun ction with the CUSOM Alumni Asso ciation and creditation and M edical Educ ation to tr ack amination performance, spec ialty certifica tion, post -gradu ate employment, and career activities f or each gradua ting c lass. Through this process, CUSOM is able to evaluate and adjust recruitm ent practices and policies to e nsure the Mission a nd Go als of the institution a re being met. 3.2 Requireme nts for Ad mission To be consid ered for an int erview, appli cants to CUSOM are requir ed to compl ete a minimum of 75 per cent of the r equired credits for a degree at a c ollege or unive rsity accredit ed by an age ncy r ecogniz ed by the United State s Department of Education. To be c onsid ered for admission, a pplicants must h ave earned, or are scheduled to earn, a baccalaur eate d egree prior to mat riculation at CUSOM and submit s cores f rom the Medical Coll ege Admission T est (MCAT ). For the current admission cy cle, CUSOM will accept the MCAT administration up to thr ee years prior to the ye ar of mat riculation unless with the D ean's e xception. Most competitive applicants to CUSOM have MCAT s cores at the 50th pe rcentile or higher. The most c ompetitive a pplicants h ave high er MCAT scores. Applicants should have achieved at least a 3.2 Science and Overall cumulative grade point average (GPA) on a 4.0 scale. The most competitive applicants have higher Science and Overall cumulative GPAs. The admissions process is highly competitive, and higher GPAs and MCAT scores may increase chances for acceptance. CUSOM also places emphasis on the applicant's in -person interview. The requir ed und ergradua te courses for entry a re: Biological Sciences: One year with l aboratory (8 semest er hours/12 qua rter hours) Physics: One year (6 to 8 semest er hours/9 to 12 q uarter hours) Inorganic/General Chemistry: One year with la boratory (8 semester hours/12 quarter hours) Organic Ch emistry: One year w ith labo ratory (8 semest er hours/12 qua rter hours ); the second semester of Organic Chemistry can be substituted by Biochemistry 22 English: One year (6 semest er hours/8 qua rter hours) Six (6) additional science hours are highly recommended. CUSOM recommends courses in the 300/400 level or higher, such as Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Genetics, Mic robiol ogy, and Immunolo gy, which may enhance pe rformance in medi cal school. NOTE: Courses with equivalent content will be reviewed. NOTE: Students must obtain a grade of \"C\" or better in each of the required courses above to fulfill the pre-requisite course requirement. Applic ants are require d to me et the T echnical Standards, including required immunizations for healthcare workers, for a dmission and continu ed enrollm ent, and affirm that he or she m eets the standa rds. Any falsifica tion or misinfor mation (e.g. not disclosing prior to mat riculation a known, pre -existing, issue whi ch would le ad to not meeting the Te chnical Standards) regarding the a bility to me et the T echnical Standards may result in dismissal f rom the program. Applic ants must submit all requir ed paperwork per published d eadlines outlined by the Office of Admissions. If pa perwork is not submitted received a s required, an off er of admission may be rescinded. 3.3 Technical S tandards for Admission to CUSOM The requir ements to su cceed at CUSOM are those n ecessary to su ccessfully compl ete the curriculum and to pra ctice osteop athic medic ine with full pra ctice rights. Students must be a ble to function in a v ariety of le arning and clinical settings, and to quickly, accurately, and consistently le arn and proc ess data. Ost eopathic physici ans utilize palpation (clinic ally appropri ate touching) a s part of the physical examination and osteopa thic approa ch to treatme nt. As pa rt of the education al proc ess, CUSOM students must be able to tol erate b eing palpated , examined and rec eive ost eopathic manipulation by memb ers of all genders, and to touch, e xamine , and provide osteopa thic manipulation to othe rs (of all genders) in order to ac quire the skills n ecessary for palpation a nd examination. This p alpation is p erformed in a pro fession al and a ppropri ate manner. Acquiring the skills to palpate and examine p atients requir es a student to examine partially disrobe d patients of all genders and is mandatory for suc cessful c ompletion of the curriculum at CUSOM. Students are requir ed to parti cipate fully as both the examiner and e xaminee in v arious clinical labor atory experiences. In Clinical Skills and Osteop athic Manipulative M edicine laboratory experiences, as well as oth er clinic al laboratori es where physical examination skills are acquir ed, students a re require d to participate in the examination of fellow students of all gend ers who may be partially disrob ed. 23 In orde r to be able to ga in appropri ate clinical exposure to the regions be ing examined and osteopa thic manipulative te chniques to be provide d, students ne ed to w ear attire, such as shorts and are expected to partially disrobe for c ertain labo ratory experiences. Please refer to the Dress Code Policy (Section 6.5 of this Bulletin ) for additional information. Addition ally, CUSOM utiliz es cadavers in the gross a natomy laboratory. As suc h, CUSOM students must be a ble to tole rate wo rking with, a nd touching, cadavers. CUSOM students also pa rticipate in ultrasound l abs and, as such, will be requir ed to perform ultr asound examination of fellow students of all genders who may be pa rtially disrob ed.

L etters of recomm endation may not be written by a r elative, in cluding relatives through marriage. CUSOM accepts lette rs through A ACOM AS, Inter folio a nd mail. Letters of re comm endation whi ch are includ ed as a part of the pre -health committee packe t or lette rs from an of ficial evaluation collection s ervice (AACOMAS or Interfolio) re cogniz ed by CUSOM a s a part of their offi cial packet and a re accepted without sign ature or lette rhead, as long as the lette rs are s ent dir ectly from the authors to the pre -health committe e. If the applic ant's s chool do es not utilize a pre - health c ommitte e, a lett er must be f rom a s cience fac ulty memb er (typically a PhD ) famili ar with the a cademic work of the a pplicant. A second letter of recommendation must be from either an osteopathic physician (DO) or an allopathic physician (MD). Although a letter from an osteopathic physician is not required, it is strongly recommended. 29 While shadowing experience with a DO is not required, applicants who have shadowing experience with an osteopathic physician demonstrate commitment to the profession and understanding of the practice of osteopathic medicine. CUSOM w elcom es additional lette rs of support or re comm endation from those who are acquainted with the student's academic or profe ssion al ability. All a dditional letters of re comm endation must be origin als on profe ssion al or college/university letterhead, sign ed by the e valuator , and s ent dire ctly to the CUSOM Office of Admissions. 3.9 CUSOM Selection Process To be considered for an interview, each applicant must meet all the preceding admissions requirements and Technical Standards for admission and have a complete application file, including the AACOMAS application, a Secondary Application, proof of US Citize nship or Permanent US Residency (Passport , Green Card or Certificate of Naturalization), F1 student or other study -authorized nonimmigrant status, or recipients of Deferred Ac tion for Childhood Arrival (DACA) , a form/letter of recommendation from either an osteopathic or allopathic physician, a recommendation form/letter from a pre- medical or pre -health committee or science faculty member (typically a PhD) and the processing fee or AACOMAS fee waiver . Addition information may be required by CUSOM as necess ary. After receipt of all of th ese mat erials, the a pplicant's file is review ed by the Of fice of Admissions to d etermine eligibility for a n interview based on criteria establish ed by the CUSOM Admissions Committ ee. Each applicant who accepts an invitation to interview can choose the option to either interview on -campus or interview remotely. In either format, the applicant will interview with members of the CUSOM faculty, staff , and administration. During the interview, the applicant's academic history and knowledge may be reviewed as well as the attributes which demonstrate the potential to become a caring and compet ent osteopa thic physicia n and fit for CUSOM 's Mission . At the conclusion of the int erviews, the int erviewers submit their re comm endation through WebAdMIT for review by the Dire ctor of Admissions, and these recomm endations are pres ented and discussed during an Admissions Committe e meeting. The Admissions Committ ee revie ws each applicant who int erviews with CUSOM and mak es a rec omm endation of either \"accept\" or \"de ny\" admission to the Dean. The Dean, as the Chief Academic Officer, makes a ll final decisions on candidate status. The Dean dec ides to grant or deny acceptance of each candidate. This d ecision is provide d to the a pplicant in a timely mann er, by email notification within 2 -4 weeks of the interview date. Upon request, a formal letter of the Dean's offer of acceptance can be sent to the candidate at a later date. 30 Intentional misr epresentation or omission of infor mation on a ny form or records relev ant to admissions subje cts the applicant to a retra ction of an offer for admission, or dismiss al of the student in the ca se the misr epresentation/omission is discov ered after matriculation. CUSOM reserves the right to deny admission to any applicant for any reason it deems appropriate. Matriculation may be denied to applicants who have failed to maintain a good record of scholastic performance or good record of personal conduct between the time of their acceptance and their m atriculation at CUSOM. Inability to maintain complian ce with e ducational training te chnical stand ards, including required immunizations for healthcare workers, may a lso result in the revoc ation of a cceptance or matriculation. Addi tionally, applicants found to ha ve screening tests posit ive for alcohol, pres cription medications whi ch are illeg al in the state of North Carolina may result in revocation of an offer of a cceptan ce or dismissal from the program in the case positive tests are discovered after matriculation. Controlle d subst ance screening results a re view ed in light of North Carolina and fede ral la ws governing illegal substanc es. For example, although the use of mariju ana is leg al in some state s, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Ag ency lists it as an illeg al drug. Its use or a buse imp airs the a bility of a health care profe ssion al to provide optimal care to his or he r patients. As su ch, the use of ma rijuana in any form is a violation of Univ ersity policy. 3.10 Guaranteed Interview Process This i s onl y applicable to Campbell Unive rsity undergraduate stud ents wi th: A min and Overall GPA of 3.30 on a 4.0 scale.

Applicants need to understand tha t for intern and residency sites, clearance for the permission to participate in clinical training is determined by the site, not CUSOM. Certain sites have more time -consuming clearance processes, such as Veterans Administration hospitals and other federa l facilities. CUSOM cannot guarantee clearance for the permission to participate in clinical training at a specific site but will work to place students at the necessary sites to complete their educational requirements. CUSOM policy requires applicants who have completed coursework at foreign institutions be evaluated for U.S. equivalence by one of the evaluation services listed on the AACOM website: https://choosedo.org The evaluation service must verify course work completed at an institution outside of the US is comparable to a regionally -accredited US college or university in a course -by- course fashion. CUSOM does not a ccept transfer students from international m edical s chools. 3.15 Do ctor and Doctor of Osteopathic Med icine (JD/DO) Dual Degree Program The Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine and the Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law offer a six -year combined program of study (JD/DO Dual Degree Program) leading to awarding of both the Juris Doctor (JD) degree and the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree upon successful completion of all requirements. One significant benefit of the combined program is the opportunity for students to complete the program in six years, thereby reducing the amount of time it would otherwise ta ke to earn these two degrees separately by one calendar year. Graduates will be poised to obtain significant positions of leadership, administration, and management and will be well equipped to serve as leaders in their professional and civic communities, working to make significant contributions at the intersection of law and the medicine. While Campbell JD/DO graduates will most likely practice in just one of the professions, their studies will provide them with exceptional insights into today's complex medico -legal issues. This program is rigorous and demanding and enrollment will be limited to those students meeting the criteria for both Campbell University School of Law and Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine Admissions Standards. Students admitt ed to the JD/DO program compl ete both de grees in six years , beginning their studi es in the C ampbell Univ ersity S chool of Law. 34 During the fi rst ye ar, the student would be gin law school studi es during the Summ er Semester follow ed by l aw school c lasses in fall, spring, a nd summ er semesters. During the second year of the combined program, the student would be gin medi cal studi es at C ampbell Univ ersity S chool of Ost eopathic M edicine and compl ete th ree years in medi cal studi es before returning to the law school. As a du al degree progr am, it is import ant to note that both the law s chool and the medi cal school a re ac credit ed. North Carolina has six ABA -accredit ed law schools: 1. Campbell Unive rsity 2. Duke ersity 3. Elon Unive North Ca rolina 5. Univ ersity of North Ca rolina Ch apel Hill 6. Wake Forest Uni versity North Carolina has five LCME- or COC A-accredited medi of North Ca (LCME-accredited) 5. Wake Forest Uni versity (LCME-accredited) CUSOM is the only osteopa thic medica l school in Nor th Carolina, and the JD/DO progr am is unique. In North C arolina, at the time of this Bulle tin only Duke University has a simil ar dual-degree progr am. In the United Stat es, the only other osteopa thic medi cal school with a simil ar joint d egree progr am is Row an Univ ersity in New J ersey. Applicants to the JD/DO Dual Degree program must first apply to both degree programs individually in the same academic year and meet all admission requirements outlined for both the Campbell University Juris Doctor (JD) and the Campbell University Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) programs. The application deadl ine for the JD/DO Dual Degree program is November 15 . Applicants must be new applicants to and have accepted offers of admission from both degree programs to be eligible for review and acceptance into the JD/DO Dual Degree program. Acceptance into the JD and DO degree programs individually does not guarantee acceptance into the JD/DO Dual Degree program. The admissions process for the JD/DO Dual Degree program begins with applicants submitting a written request to both the law and medicine programs indicating their interest in pursuing and matriculating into the JD/DO Dual Degree program. 35 Only applicants who were offered admission into the DO and the JD programs (in the same academic year), and who have formally accepted these offers, will be review ed by the Dual Degree Program Committee for admission to the JD/DO Dual Degree program. Applicants will undergo an additional committee interview to discuss additional supplemental application material for the JD/DO Dual Degree program. Moreover, this interview will be open file and may include documents from the applicant's AACOMAS, Secondary Application, and additional s upplemental application materials for the DO school .

Compl eted medical history form 2. Proof of all CUSOM i mmunization requirements 3. Completed controlled substance screen (described below) 4. Completed physical examination conduc ted by a licensed physician using the a ppropri ate CUSOM form Students must obtain all CUSOM -requir immuniz ations and corresponding titers, prior to ements all requir ed sup ervised clinical pra ctice experiences in the CUSOM curriculum. Ple ase refer to the CUSOM Immuniz ation Policy , available in the O ffice of Stud ent Affairs, for a compl ete description of a ll immuniz ation requir ements. Entering MS -1 (first -year) students who have not completed all CUSOM immunization requirements by the end of Block 1 will not be permitted to participate in the White Coat ceremony and will be called to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for rev iew and adjudication as delineated in Section 6.7 of th is Bulletin. In addition, non- compliance with CUSOM Immunization Requirements will result in inability to participate in any clinical experiences (including , but not limited to , standardized patient OSCEs, early clinical experiences, and clinical rotations). This may result in unexcused absences leading to failure of a course or clinical rotation, academic probation, Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee hearing, delay in graduation, or even dismissal from the program. All students must provide written documentation utilizing the AAMC Standardized Immunization Form (completed and signed by their health care provider or institutional representative) verif ying all CUSOM -required immunization and titer requirements, as listed below, and in accordance with the CDC Guid elines (https://www .cdc.gov/va ccines/ adults/rec-vac/hcw.htm l), the following: Diphthe ria, Per tussis and Tetanus o All s tudents m ust submit document ation (physician signature or vaccinatio n record) of i mmuniz ation with a *Tda p boost er (Boostrix\u00ae or Adacel\u00ae) since t he year 20 05. o Following the T dap boos ter, proof of a Td r outine boost er is required every ten (10) years 37 TB test (prior to matriculation and again prior to each year of c linical rotations) o There are two (2) acceptable methods for TB screening and all students must provide document ation of the results from O NE of the two methods: A two -step tube rculin (IGRAs ) blood TB mu st be obt ained w ithin six ( 6) months of matriculation Hepatitis B virus (quantitative titer) o Students must provide dates and ve rification (vaccination r ecord) of compl eting a Hepatitis B vaccination s eries consist ing of three (3) hepatitis B in jections o In addition, ve rification of quantitative demonstr ating immuni ty to hepa titis B must be provided Students who do not sho w im munity followi ng the vaccination series should r efer to the Immunization Pol icy for further steps MMR: Measles (Rube ola), Mumps and Rube lla o Students must provide da tes and ve rification (vaccination r ecord) of two (2) M MR vaccinations, oc curring at least 28 da ys apart If the stude nt is able to pr ovide a n immuniz ation record or physician si gnature verifying the d ates of these two ( 2) vaccinations, no titer will be required o Students una ble to pr ovide im munization records or physician signature v erifying completion of the MMR series have two ( 2) options: Repeat t he MMR series of two ( 2) vaccinations a t least 2 8 days apart and provide document ation verifying compl etion of the series Obtain asles, mumps, and rubella Varicella the matriculation) Influenza vaccin ation every year COVID -19 vaccination as recommended for healthcare providers, once developed. Taking steps to minimize the risk of COVID -19 infections (or any other spread of disease) at CUSOM is a shared responsibility. Every member of our community - including you - must do their part. This means adhering to national, state, and local health guidelines and requirements, and adhering to those measures CUSOM deems safe and appropriate for its campus. Specific details will be provided as circumstances dictate, but this may include such thing as: temperature checks, social distancing, wearing mas ks or other facial coverings, using other PPE, not reporting to class or work if sick, and isolating and quarantining when required. You agree to do all of this not just for yourself, but for the safety of others, and because this is consistent with the spirit of CUSOM . 38 In some situations, clinical training sites may h ave addition al immuniz ation requir ements a bove those w aive immuniz ation or student health requir ements at any time a s deemed necessary, and all students will be required to comply with any subs equent changes. 3.16.2 National Background Checks CUSOM applicants are required to self -disclose any charges, arrests or convictions including misdemeanors, felonies, deferred adjudications, traffic violations, military non -judicial punishment, courts martial, and general or less - than-honorable discharge from the military, (all hereinafter \"Offenses\") with the understand ing that non -disclosure/falsification of any previous or pending Offenses may result in the revocation of the offer of admission. If a student has any Offenses pending final adjudication at any time during the application process, at the time of matriculation, or following matriculation it is the student's responsibility to immediately inform CUSOM. Additionally, in response to requirements in the professional practice environment and to minimize the risk to patients, a background check will be completed on all accepted applicants prior to matriculation, and on any student whose actions could potentially be considered a risk to others at any time. Should any Offenses, including deferred adjudications occur after matriculation, (1) the student mus t report the Offenses to the Executive Director of Student Affairs within thirty (30) days of the incident, or (2) if Offenses occurring prior to matriculation are not reported to CUSOM at the time of application but are subsequently discovered following m atriculation, the Offense will be reviewed pursuant to the Procedures for Non- Academic M atters under Section 6.7.3 of this Bulletin . A national background check can be done at any time, and is also done on each student prior to the start of clinical rotations . Students must be aware that results may be requested by the clinical sites and will be provided if requested . By matriculating to CUSOM, the student agrees to allow CUSOM to share background check information in full with the student's respective clinical site(s) . Additional national background checks may be performed at the discretion of CUSOM or its partnering institutions before accepting a student into a clinical rotatio n. 39 National background checks may be required at any time deemed appropriate by CUSOM. Discovery of any previously non- reported Offense(s) may lead to referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee and possible sanctions, u p to, and including, dismissal from the program. CUSOM has no control over the content of third- party background checks. Even expunged records may appear on these background checks. Background checks revealing prior Offenses, even charges which may have been dismissed by the courts, could still result in consequences affecting clinical rotations, acceptance into residency programs, future licensing, specialty board certification, or employment opportunities. If a student is unable to complete clinical r otations due to the inability to pass background check requirements, they will not be capable of making academic progress or be able to meet graduation requirements. In addition, and as such, they will be referred to the APPS committee for possible sancti ons, up to, and including, dismissal from the program. A student with any Offenses is encouraged to contact the licensure boards in the state of intended practice to ensure the aforementioned Offense will not inhibit the ability to obtain a medical licens e upon graduation. All current or former students returning from an approved extended period away from CUSOM, such as a Leave of Absence or an offer to repeat an academic year, must notify CUSOM in writing of any Offenses, including deferred adjudications , at least sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date. An Offense occurring less than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date must be reported to the Executive Director of Student Affairs within 24 hours of the Offense. Non- disclosure or falsification of any information related to an Offense may result in the revocation of the offer to return to CUSOM, or if already returned to CUSOM, referral to the APPS Committee for possible sanctions up to, and including, dismissal from the program. CUSOM retains the right to relinquish the seat of any current or former student returning f rom an extend ed absence if they h ave been crimin ally charged or convicted of a misde meanor, f elony, or traf fic vio lation. Students who ha ve already r esumed classes following an extende d absence, who have been or are crimin ally charged or c onvict ed of a misde meanor, f elony, or traff ic viol ation will be r eferred to the APPS Committee for s anctions up to, and including, dismiss al from the progr am. As future physici ans, students a re held to a high stand ard of professionalism, ethics, and honor , and CUSOM ha s a duty to prot ect the public from potential harm by its students. 40 All current or former students returning from an approved period away from CUSOM including, but not limited to, a Leave of Absence or an offer to repeat an academic year, minimally must submit a completed Secondary Application, national background check, and controlled substance screen within a timef rame designated by CUSOM , but no l ater than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipa ted return date. Addi tional requir ements, su ch as a psy chiatric or medical evaluation, may be placed on returning students as dee med appropriate. Students who do not return on the approv ed date, or othe rwise do not fulfill a ll of the requir ements for return yet still wish to attend CUSOM , will have to re - apply through AACOMAS and will not be guaranteed re -admission . 3.16.3 Driver's Li cense As the clinical campus system of CUSOM is widespread across the states of North and South Carolina, all applicants must provide evidence of a valid driver's license to allow for travel to clinical rotations. Students may have to drive up to an hour from the premier educational partner of their respective regional site for an assigned rotation. Therefore, evidence of a valid driver's license must be provided to the Office of Student Affairs by the end of the first year of medical school. Failure to provide evidence of this item by the en d of the first year of medical school may prevent the student from being promoted to the second year of medical school. 3.16.4 Basic Li fe Support Skills CUSOM students are required to have Basic Life Support (BLS) training prior to matriculation and must maintain active certification through graduation. Each student must provide a copy of their American Heart Association CPR card, documenting current BLS for Healthcare Providers certification . CUSOM only accepts BLS for Healthcare Provider courses authorized by the American Heart Association. Failure to provide evidence of appropriate certification may result in revocation of an offer of acceptance. BLS certification must be maintained throug hout your enrollment at CUSOM. If you plan on caring for patients in a clinical setting, such as the Community Care Clinic, your BLS certification must be up to date. 3.16.5 Controlled Substance Screening In response to requirements in the professional practice environment and to minimize the risk to patients, a controlled substance screening must be completed by all accepted applicants prior to matriculation. This screening must meet CUSOM's standards and be conducted by an agency approved by CUSOM. 41 Controlled substance screening results are viewed in light of state and federal laws governing illegal or controlled substances. If the controlled substance screening test result is positive (i.e. evidence of a controlled substance) or shows other abnormal ities including, but not limited, to excessively diluted urine, an ad hoc committee will be assigned to review the case . Depending on the recommendation of the ad hoc committee, the student's acceptance may be rescinded. For example, although the use of marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to his or her patients. As such, the use of marijuana in any form is a violation of University policy. By signing the Attestation confirming that students have read and acknowledge compliance with the precepts contained in the CUSOM Academic Bulletin, each applicant to CUSOM promises he/she is not currently using, and he/she will not use while a CUSOM student, any products or substances in any manner which are illegal in the state of North Carolina. CUSOM has no control over the content of third- party background checks, which may include charges of driving under the influence. Even expunged records may appear on these checks. Background checks revealing prior Offenses, even Offenses which may have been dismissed by the courts, could still result in consequences affecting clinical rotations, acceptance into residen cy programs, future licensing, specialty board certification, or employment opportunities. A random controlled substance screening is required prior to starting clinical rotations, and all results are shared with the clinical sites. Additional screenings may be required, at any time, at the discretion of CUSOM or partnering - institutions. By matriculating to CUSOM, the student agrees t o allow CUSOM to share controlled substance screening results as deemed necessary. If either of the following events occu r, the matter will be referred to the APPS Committee for review in accordance with the Procedures for Non -Academic Matters under Section 6.7 .3 of this Bulletin : 1. Any substance-related incident which occurs before or after matriculation, including , but not limited to, charges/arrests for Driving Under the Influence, must be reported by the student to the CUSOM Office of Student Affairs within thirty (30) days of the o ccurrence. 2. If the controlled substance screening test result is posit ive (i.e. evidenc e of a controll ed substance) or shows other abnorm alities including , but not limited, to excessi vely diluted urine. 42 3.16.6 Transcripts All CUSOM students are requir ed to provide official tr anscripts f rom all colleges and unive rsities attended if they h ave course wor k which was not includ ed or degree(s) not conferred with the transcripts submitted through AACOMAS. All transcripts are included in the student's original AACOMAS application so students are only required to provide CUSOM official transcripts from coursework completed and degree(s) conferred after the AACOMAS application was submitted. All students must submit all requir ed paperwork by the publishe d deadlin es. Failure to submit infor mation could r esult in a n offer of admission b eing rescinded. Falsifica tion of a ny doc ument or omission of any p ertinent information may result in dismiss al from the program if dis covered after matriculation. 43 4. Student Expenses and Financial Aid 4.1 Cost of Attendance 4.1.1 Secondary Application Fee A non-refunda ble fee of $50.00 is payable upon submission of the Seconda ry Application for admission. D etails regarding fee submis sion are include d in the email invitation to submit a Seconda ry Application. CUSOM will waive this fee if the a pplicant has a n approve d AACOM AS fee waiver documen t. 4.1.2 Accep tance Fee Accepted students must submit a non- refundable fee of $1,500.00 to CUSOM by the deadline designated in their offer of acceptance. Payment is c redited toward tuition upon mat riculation. 4.1.3 Tuition and Fees Tuition is subject to chang e annua lly.

The financial aid program assists students in the fo rm of ins titutional scholarships and student loans. The Office provide s financial aid couns eling to prospective applicants and to CUSOM graduates and bey ond. The CUSOM Office of Financial Aid is respons ible for the administration of the student financial aid program. Financial aid couns eling is provide d to all prospect ive students as part of the applicant interview process. During each applicant interview session, a financial aid couns elor provid es a fin ancial aid presentation. aid couns eling is also a vailable to stude nts b y appointment. The O ffice of Financial Aid will email all accep ted students information related to applying for financial aid. Students interested in applying for financial aid are required to comple te the Fre e Applic ation for Fe deral Student Aid (FAFSA), and the Statement of Financial Responsibility. Students must also provide any other document ation required by federal, state, and private financial assistance programs to determine eligibility for student financial assistance. Financial aid couns eling is presented to incomin g students at the Financial Aid Entrance Interview Presentatio n during O rientation. Attendance at this financial aid presentation is mandatory for all students. During the presentation , feder al entrance couns eling requirements are discussed including eligibilit y calcul ations, borro wer rights and responsibilitie s, and loan informatio n. A review of the financial aid applicatio n process , loan disburse ments, billing proces s, deferments, recor d keeping , and debt manage ment are also discussed.

Scholarship Committee members review each candidate and forward recommendations to the Dean for approval of scholarship consideration. Once approved by the Dean, all decisions ar e final. Candidates selected for scholarship consideration are emailed a letter by the CUSOM Assistant Director of Financial Aid inviting them to apply for the respective scholarship. An invitation to submit an essay does not guarantee the student a scholarship. 48 In order to be considered for scholarship, a student must complete and return an essay, of no more than 500 words, explaining the following: Why the student would b e an excellent candidate for scholarship assistance How the st udent will c ontribute to improving healthcare in No rth Carolina What the student will contribute to Campbell University How did the student reach the decision to study Osteopathic Medicine All scholarship essays must be returned to CUSOM by the due date specifi ed on the scholarship invi tation. Com pleted essays should be submi tted via e mail to: CUSOMFinancialAid@Campbell.edu The Assistant Director of Financial Aid reviews the essay content and makes scholarship recommendations to the Dean who will make all final scholarship decisions. The Assistant Director of Financial Aid notifies scholarship recipients of their award by a formal scholarship notification letter and an email. Along with the award notification, students receive a Scholarship Acceptance Contract, which must be comple ted and returned to CUSOM's Assista nt Director of Financial Aid by the due date. Failure to comple te and return the contract by the due date will r esult in forfeiture of the s cholarship. To accept a scholarship officially, the student must return their Admissions Acceptance Form and Scholarship Acceptance Contract . Students who fail to submit all of these items by the due date will forfeit their CUSOM scholarship. CUSOM grants sch olarships until funding is exhausted or as long as the qualified candidate pool exists. If a student selected to receive a Presidenti al or Dean's Scholarship also receives a full tu ition s cholarship from an external source (e.g., Health Professions Scholarship Program ( HPSP) or the National Health Service Corps Scholarship), they relinqu ish eligibility for the Presidential, D ean's, and Campbell Un iversity S cholarsh ips. The Scholarship Com mittee may also evaluate candidat es for other outside or endow ed scholarships as appropri ate. 49 4.3.2 Endowed Scholarships The Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine is grateful for the financial assistance made available to students each year through our Endowed Scholarship Program. Through the generosity of the University's many supporters, endowed scholarships are established to help our students receive a quality medical education.

Weekly schedules vary based on course content and space needs but are gene rally stru ctured so that lectures prim arily take place in the morn ing with labs and clinical skills typical ly taking place in the a fternoons. Lecture-discuss ions a re comple ment ed by labs a nd clinical skil ls sessions with embedde d study time. OMM and other clinical skills are taught longitudinal ly throughout the fi rst two years in a progression designed to integra te with and provi de a s eamless transition to the third and fourth years. Content is presented by biome dical faculty and physicians incorporating team-teaching and small group learning. For years three and four , clinical rotations are typically four (4) weeks in dur ation at the Regional Clinical sites. Evaluation of performance during the first 8 Blocks include s integrated exams, quizzes , OS CE, clinical skills, anatomy, OMM practical exams, and end-of- year evaluations. Weekl y clinical case exercises help students integrate and apply mat erial presented during the week and provide faculty with an assessment of stude nt progress. For years three and four, student evaluation is performed by clinical preceptors at the end of each clinical rotation, and similarly students evaluate each clinical rotation to promote curricular improve ment. The minimum length of the osteopathic medical curriculum at CUSOM is 167 weeks over four academic years. The curriculum duration for each year is: Year 1 = 37 weeks Year 2 = 38 weeks Year 3 = 48 weeks Year 4 = 44 weeks The minimum number of credits required to earn the DO degree is 319.5. Programmatic Level Educational Outcome Objectives CUSOM has adopted the 2012 American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medici ne (AACOM) Osteopathic Core Competencies for Medical Students as the programmatic level educational outcome objectives for graduates since these also align with the mission of the university and medical school. 54 These Osteopathic Core Competencies measure specific objectives along the following 14 competency domains: 1. Osteop athic Principles and Practices 2. Medical Knowledge 3. Patient Care 4. Interpe rsonal and Communication Skills 5. Professionalism 6. Practice- Based Learning and Improvement 7. Systems -Based Practice 8. Counseling for Health Promotion/Disease Prevention 9. Cultural Competencies 10. Evaluation of Health Sciences Literature 11. Environmental and Occupational Medicine (OEM) 12. Public Health Systems 13. Global Health 14. Interprofessional Collaboration The four -year Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine curriculum, which embodies the mind, body, spirit philosophy of the osteopathic profession and mission of Campbell University, is a traditional systems -based curriculum consistent with many medical schools in the United States. The four-year course of study begins with integrated biomedical and clinical didactic and laboratory activities leading up to the third - and fourth- year clinical rotations, which provide the necessary clinical training for transition to , and success in , subsequent residency programs. For the full description and detailed listing of objectives, please refer to the official 2012 document published by AACOM linked her e. 5.1.2 Clinical Shadowing Policies and Procedur es CUSOM M edical Student Shadowing Many students choos e to engag e in clinical shadowing experiences during breaks in the fo rmal CUSOM curriculum such as during Block breaks, summer break, or weekends. S hadowing experiences can be extremely valuable , and students may choos e to include these ex periences in their Curriculum Vitae, personal statement or Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). Shadowing experiences can occur with CUSOM - appointe d clinical faculty memb ers or physicians not a ffiliate d with CUSOM . It is essential that stude nts choosing to engage in shadowi ng experiences unde rstand the differences between shadowing and the requir ed clinical rotations students pa rticipate in as part of the CUSOM curriculum. Clinical rotations that occur in conjunction with the CUSOM clinical curriculum 55 (e.g., O utreach, International Medical Missions , and MS-3 and MS-4 scheduled rotations) are c omple ted under the supervision of CUSOM - appointe d clinical faculty and follow very specific guidelines in regards to student's roles, respons ibilities, supe rvision r equirements, and feedback and evaluation proces ses. In contrast to clinical curriculum experiences, shadowing experiences do not occur as part of the stude nt's required CUSOM c urriculum and m ay lack the defined stru cture, supe rvision, feedback mechanisms, and medi cal-legal protections provide d by formal c linical rotations. Students choosing to engage in a shadowi ng experience ackno wledge they will do so while a dhering to the following principles: 1. Shadowing experiences are meant to be observational only and if any hands -on activity occurs with patients, this should be limited to patient examination only, approved by the patient and supervising physician, and MUST be repeated by the physician. To protect patients and students, students are not to perform any invasive procedures while on shadowing experiences, including but not limited to suturing, endotracheal intubation, performing arterial blood gas testing, or placing IV's, Foley catheters, or central lines or perform exams of the pelvic, breast, rectal and genitourinary systems. Students should not perform any osteopathic manipulation while on shadowing experiences. 2. Students are not protected by malp ractice insurance provided by Campbe ll Un iversity, Incorpora ted while engaged in physician shadowing experiences unless the experience is with a CUSOM- appointed faculty memb er and part of the curriculum . Students are required to let non- CUSOM ap pointed physicians they are shadowing know that th ey are not covered by malp ractice insurance provide d by Campbell University, Incorporated. 3. Students must follow all hospital system, facility, and ambul atory policies when engaging in any type of shadowing experience. Individual physicians chosen to shadow with may not be familiar with their facility or healthcare system pol icies so it is the student's respons ibility to make sure they review and compl y with a ny applicable pol icies. 4. Indivi dual physicians may not know the student's level of training and it is the refore the student's e thical and pr ofessional dut y to fully explain their lev el of tr aining. 56 Shadowing with CUSOM Cl inical F aculty M embers 1. Students who desire to shadow CUS OM clinical faculty must arrange the e xperience on their own. 2. Students shadowing with CUSOM clinical faculty memb ers should wear their CUSOM n ame badge and white c oat unless dir ected otherwise by their preceptor. 3. Students wishing to schedule a shadowing experience with a CUSOM clinical faculty memb er must submit the Shadowing Agreement Form , (available from the Office of Clinical Affairs) c ompleted in its entirety to the Office of Clinical Affairs. 4. Shadowing experiences should be arranged in conjunction with the preceptor and Regional Dean (when applicable), both of whom must sign the a greement form to indicate t heir approval. 5. Students m ust sign the f orm a nd initial all required attestations. 6. The completed form must be submi tted to the Office of Clinical Affairs for review and approval at least two (2) weeks prior to the start of the requested shadowing e xperience. Shad owing with non-CUSOM Clinicians 1. Students who desire to shadow non-CUS OM clinicians must arrange the experience on their own. 2. These are non-CUSOM sanctioned experiences thus: a. CUSOM will not obta in affiliation agreements with the si tes in order to provide shadowing experiences. b. CUSOM will n ot provide the c linician or si te with any student records including, but not limited to, results of drug screens and backgro und checks, i mmuniz ation records, acade mic performance information or letters of recommendation. c. Students may not wear their CUSOM white coat or name tag. d. Students or the physician they are shadowi ng are not protected by malpractice insurance through Campbell University, Incorporated . e. Students acknowl edge tha t Campbell Univ ersity, Incorpora ted will not be li able for a ny medi cal care or expenses if they a re injured or become ill during the clinical shadowing experience. They also release Campbell Univ ersity, In corpor ated f rom any li ability from any injury or illness which occ urs during the sha dowing e xperience. 3. Even if engaging in shadowing experiences with non-CUSOM clinicians or clinical sites, students must abide by all general guidelines noted previous ly in this doc ument. Violation of any conditions of this Shad owing Policy is handled as a professionalism issue and may be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion an d Standards (APPS) Committee. 57 5.2 Years 1 and 2 Curriculum The first two years of the CUSOM curriculum focus on teaching student s funda ment al principles of biome dical science with significant emphasis on clinical science, elements of clinical practice, and professionalism. Histori cally, the fi rst two years of medi cal school ins truction ha ve been vi ewed as \"pre-clinical\" with the remainin g two years being viewed as \"clinical\". At CUS OM, the curriculum is integrated to provide a core of strong biome dical principles in addition to a robust founda sciences ofessionalism. 5.2.1 Curricular Content Overview All semest ers of the first and second year are partitioned into two 9-week Blocks, with the except ion of ten (10) weeks for Block 4 and eleve n (11) weeks for Block 8. Within the first two Blocks, students are in troduced to the biome dical y, Pathology, Pharmacolo gy, and Physiology. Anatomy continues throughout the first year, integrating wh erever possible with the systems approach of the remain ing thr ee semest ers of the first two years. In Blocks 3 throu gh 8, the CUSOM c urriculum follows a n organ-system approach to medi cal educa tion. Facu lty utilize instructional materials which go beyond the basic bio medical principles mastered during the first semest er. Biomedical faculty, prim ary care physicians, and sub-special ty physicians collaborate to deliver integrated content relating to the particular organ system. The Clinical Skills and Ost eopathic Manipula tive Medicine courses address content that will allow CUSOM students to learn, integrate , and apply the basic philosophy , principles, and practice of osteo pathic medi cine. Hands-on of osteopa thic whol e-person incorporate stat e-of-the-art instruction. Addit ionally, Simulation and Standardized Patient experiences allow stude nts to enhance their c linical skills, such as physical exam te chniques, interviewing, couns eling, and medical reporting skills necessa ry to progre ss to the third a nd fourth years. The Founda tions of Medical Practice (FMP) courses provide CUSOM students a broad ove rview of biostatistics, evidenced -based medici ne, epidemiology , population health, re search methodol ogy, and experimental design. The students are exposed to the calcul ations and strategies required to approp riately locate, interpret, design, and comple te a research/schol arly paper with clinically relevant knowl edge related to compet ent medi cal practice. 58 The Professional Core Compet encies (PCC) courses, presented through all semest ers of the first- and second- year curriculum , are designed to teach the core compet encies neces sary for caring, compassionat e, effective, and holistic practice of osteopathic medicine throug hout the physician's career. The use of lectur e, discussion, and other unique ac tivities in troduces students to medical humani ties, biome dical ethics, medi cal law and jurisprudence, quality improvement and pa tient safety, global health issues, and profe ssionalism. 5.2.2 Schedule of Course Offerings OMM = Ost eopathic Manipul ative M edicine FMP = Foundations of Medical Practice PCC = Professional Core Competencies FIRST YEAR SEMESTER 1 (FALL) SEMESTER 2 (SPRING) Bloc k 1 Integrated Basic Science & Clinical Courses Bloc k 2 Integrated Basic Science & Clinical Courses Bloc k 3 Musculoskeletal System Bloc k 4 Neuroscience & Human Behavio r Manipul ative M edicine FMP = Foundations of Medical Practice PCC = Professional Core Competencies CABS I = C linical Applications of Biomedical Sciences I CABS II = C linical Applications of Biomedical Sciences II 5.2.3 Course Description s The curriculum in Blocks 1 and 2 of the first year introduces studen ts to the foundational biomedical conce pts of Cell and Molecular Biology , consists of introduc tory clinical training in osteop athic principles and practice in addition to bas ic clinica l skills.

A stand ardized, compet ency -based syllabus format is utilized to deliver OPP and OMM throu ghout the first and second years of the curriculum in the following mann er: 77 Year One Each student will receive a minimum of 3 hours per week of lecture and hands-on OMM inst ruction unde r the supe rvision American Board of N euromus culoske letal Medicine Board certifi ed physician and with the assistance of DO faculty table facilitators (approx imate facul ty to student ratio 1:10). The first-year courses will begin with the history of osteopa thic medi cine, research efforts in and physiological principles of osteo pathic medi cine. Students will also learn the n euromus culoske letal basis of disease and how it integrates with basic sciences su ch as anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, etc. In addition, students will learn and practic e various osteopa thic manipulative treatments, such as soft tissue techniques , muscle energy, counterstrain, high-velocity, low amplitude (HVL A) and myofascial re lease techniques to ma nage certain disease states. Year Two Each student will receive a minimum of 3 hours per week of lecture and hands -on OMM instruction under the supervision of an American Osteopathic Board of Neuromusculoskeletal Medicine Board Certified physician and with the assistance of DO faculty table facilitators (approximate faculty to student rat io 1:10). Throughout the second year, s tudents will gain a deeper understanding of body system dysfunction, homeostasis , and the role of osteopathic manipulative medicine in managing disease entities throughout the various body systems. Students will become more adept at utilizing these skills in managing all stages of patient care through infancy, adolescence, geriatrics, and pregnancy. The OMM lab will also provide students with a regular review of common techniques used to manage conditions such as short lower extremity, tension and migraine cephalgia, and cervical/thoracic/lumbar dysfunctions. Years Three and Four See Section 5.3.13 of this Bulletin for a description of the integration of OPP and OMM throughout the third- and fourth- years of the curriculum. 78 5.3 Years 3 and 4 Curriculum 5.3.1 Philosop hy of Clinical Training CUSOM students in years three and four are assigned to R egional Sites/C linical Campuses. Site assignment takes place during the second year. Clinical rotations occur within hospital sites for inpatient experiences, in ambulatory practices, and in geriatric acute care and long -term facilities. All students will spend time in rural, small, urban, or critical access hospitals for a rural/underserved care clinical experience. The clinical rotations are designed to provide the student with an education in the general areas of medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, psychiatry, family medicine, and emergency medicine. The philosophical framework of clinical education and training at CUSOM is to prepare students to become osteopathic physicians possessing the highest competencies in the profession. The program educates students to be competent osteopathic physicians who clearly recognize their roles as professionals and providers of comprehensive healthcare to the individual and the family as a unit, and to the communities they serve. Osteopathic physicians must be able to function in the role of the leader of a healthcare team to bring about needed change from the level of the individual to the level of the community. The ultimate intent of the program is to prepare patient -centered physicians who will positively impact the equality of healthcare and healthcare delivery systems and will improve healthcare access for individuals and their families. CUSOM believes the physician mus t assume a leadership role not only in the medical community but also in the broader community in which he/she serves. Community leadership is an integral part of improving the healthcare of the community as -a-whole; thus, physicians must be committed to the prevention of illness and the upgrading of the delivery of healthcare services at extended levels. In pursuit of excellence, the CUSOM clinical curriculum is a challenging blend of the tradition al and innovative components, de signed to: Foster the analytic and problem-solvi ng skills requisite for physicians invol ved in disease pr evention, diagnosis, and treatment in individual patients, f amilies, communities, a nd populations a t-large; Ensu re the acquis ition and application of basic clinical knowl edge and essential clinical skills; Develop an und erstanding of contempor ary healthcare delivery issues; Cultivate effective physician-patient relationships based upon integrity, respect, a nd compassion; Develop hi gh ethical standards; and Promote a lifelong c ommitment to l earning. 79 Following clinical training, students will be knowl edgeable about the important roles of the prim ary care physician in cluding, but not limited to, the a bility to: Demonstr ate clinical excellence, biom and med ical conditions. Provide continuing and compr ehensive c are to individuals and families. Integrate the behavioral, emotional, soc ial, and envi ronment al factors of individuals a nd families in promoting health and man aging disease. Develop and maintain t he knowl edge, skills, and attitudes required for the delivery of best care and outcom es in m odern m edical practice in a rapidly changing world. Pursue a regular and systematic p rogram of lif elong learning. Recognize ind ications for and initiate consul tation with other medical specialis ts while maintaining continuity of care. Share tasks a nd respons ibilities w ith other heal thcare professionals. Be aware of the findi ngs of relevant research; understand and critically evaluate th is bod y of research; and apply the results of re search to medical pr actice. Manage his/her practice in a business -like, cost -efficient manner which will provide professional satisfaction and time for a rewarding personal life. Serve as an advoc ate for the p atient wi thin the healthcare system. Assess the quality of care that he/she provides and actively pursue measures to continually improve. Use current medi cal knowl edge to identi fy, evaluate, and minimize risks for p atients and fa milies. Recognize community resour ces as an integral part of the healthcare system; participate in improving the heal th of the community. Inform and couns el pati ents concerni ng their health problems and recognizing and valuing dif ferences in patient and physician back grounds, beliefs, and expectation s. Develop ph ysician-patient relationsh ips condu cive to ion and pr oblem-solvi ng. Balance potential benefits, costs, and resources in determining appropr iate in terventions. Integrate and effectively utilize osteopa thic principles and practices in the d elivery of optimal p atient care. The gene ral expectations for all clinical rotations are designed to help students develop the funda ment al skills of medi cal probl em solvi ng, case management, procedur al expertise, and professional demeanor. Some clinical rotations f ocus on data acquisition (medical history, phy sical exam ination, laboratory data, or literature review) while others emphasi ze psychomot or skil ls or a ttitudes and feelings. 80 Clinical rotations are und er the direct supervision of the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs, led by the Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Affairs. CUSOM has establis hed affiliations with a wide range of hospitals, clinics, and physicians offering di verse training oppor tunities. The clinical program has been organized to permit the greatest degree of educat ional exposure in a practical, clinical environme nt and to develop expertise in the a reas of p atient diagn osis and manage ment.

They are designed to help students develop the fundamental skills of medical problem solving, case management, procedural expertise, and professional demeanor. Some rotations focus on data acquisition (medical history, physical examination, laboratory data, or literature review), while others deal purely with psychomotor skills or attitudes and feelings. Students should review these objectives carefully as their eval uation on each rotation will in large measure be based on achievement of these objectives. As a result of each clinical rotation, students should become better able to obtain an adequate, logical, and sequential medical history. Students should include in the history of present illness (HPI) those pertinent positive and negative features which demonstrate your understanding of the patient's problem. All drugs, treatments, and important previous milestones concerning that illness will be clearly noted. Past h istory will contain: Compl ete present medi cation use, including doses and lengths of time on the drug, plus prior drug experience, when applicable. All p revious sur geries, including approximate dates and sequelae. All p revious injuri es and any sequelae. Immuni zations. Quantitative estimate of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drug use, and other appropriate social histo ry. All untow ard drug reactions (allergic or toxic), including anesthetic agents and specific r eaction. If none , it sh ould be clearly noted. Family history will include all diseases with a familial tendency, or which may have a bearing on the HPI. List the ages and health sta tus of a ll first-degree relatives. Review of systems will contain some notation for each body system. Detailed and compl ete system historie s are mandatory for symptoms un covered during the review of systems. Perform and record an adequate physical examinat ion, which includes: Accurate and compl ete vital signs. A thoug htful de scription of the patient's general appearance and behavior. A thorough and complete description of physical findings pertinent to the HPI. Careful attention to findi ngs suggested by the past medi cal histo ry or review of systems. 104 The remainder of the physical examination must be sufficiently detailed to identify incidental abnormal findings not related to the present illness or positive historical clues. Write a complete H&P in the patient's chart. It should include a brief summary statement, which demonstrates you have synthesized the historical and physical exam data. Orally present the patient's data and your synthesis in 5- 10 minutes in standard, logical, sequential fashion, demonstrating your understanding of the patient's disease process and its manifestations in your patient. Apply basic medical knowledge in synthesizing a differential diagnosis and plan of management to solve the patient's problems. Success in this area requires the ability to: Generate a clear probl em list. Develop a plan of action to c onfirm diagnosis (es). Review the pertinent literature to expand student knowl edge of the problem. Identify indicated l aboratory tests. Suggest a therapeutic plan of treatment. Define patient education obj ectives and assess the patient's unde rstanding. Perform as an effective memb er of the health care team and the patients' primary physician. Gather patient information and data and offer an interpretation of the data relevant to the p atient's probl ems. Report these data on rounds and in the progress notes. P rogress notes should reflect a dispassiona te report. Acquire sufficient knowledge and skill concerning the patient's problem to be consider ed \"the local expert\" by your health care team. Demonst rate and develop the following affective (attitud es, feelings) and behavioral characteristics: Work with p atients in a respectful, compassion ate, caring, and empath etic mann er. Develop a profession al attitude and demeanor in working with patients, peers, faculty, house staff, health care profession als, and othe r persons in the health care setting. Identify and emulate appropriate role models among attendings and hous e staff, includi ng those who demonstr ate the process of developing rapport and positive communi cations with p atients, f aculty, house staff, and ot her healthcar e profession als. 105 Demonst rate the followi ng profession al behaviors: Reliability and de pendability Self-awareness Emotional sta bility Integrity and hone sty Initiative and enthusiasm Punc tualit y Self-education 5.4.2 Ethical Standards Essential hum anistic qualities required of physicians are integrity, respect, and compassion: INTEG RITY is the personal commit ment to be hone st and trustwo rthy; this include s evaluatio n and de monst ration of one's own skills and abilitie s. RESPECT is the personal commitment to honor other's choices and rights regarding thems elves a nd their medical care. COMPAS SION is an appreciation that suffering and illness engender special needs for comfort and he lp without e voking excessive emotional involvement. In broad terms, these words propose the qualities of mind and feeling that a physician shoul d bring to the profession of medi cine. T hey enforce no orthodox y. They do not establish a hierarchy of values or issue imperatives. They do not force the varied facets of each physician's personality into a rigid mold. These words describe a good relationship between patient and physician. A relationship, in whi ch the dignity and freedom of both parties are respected, and their expectations and needs are acknowl edged. This description can be interpreted in many ways; its application to different styles of personality and to diff erent situ ations is v ariable. As future physici ans, m edical students ha ve a re sponsibility to guide their actions to s erve the b est inter est of their fellow students, pa tients, and faculty. This responsibility is uphe ld by maintaining the highe st degree of p ersonal and profession al integrity.

Care for thems elves by following good health maintenance practices related to physical and me ntal health and seek help in this r egard when help is n eeded. 5.5 Clinical Rotation Scheduling 5.5.1 Assig ned Rotations Students are given a s chedule of their assign ed rotations. N o changes are allowed, except for e xtenuating medi cal, financial, or personal hardships, whi ch will be r eviewed and are at the dis cretion and approva l of the Assoc iate De an for Clinical Af fairs. Assign ed rotations not c ompl eted will be r ecorded as a failure (FC) a nd will be referred to the A PPS committee. If a stud ent is allowed to continue in the program, they may be pl aced on a Modified Course of Study in o rder to make up the r otation at a lat er time a s designated by the A PPS Committ ee or Associate Dean for Clini cal Affairs. Pla cement on a Modi fied Course of Study may result in a d elay in the student's g raduation d ate and may adversely af fect financial aid and the student's ability to p articipate in the residency m atch process. 5.5.2 Notice of Site Changes Clinical tr aining sit es are subj ect to c hange. While the training sit es are subj ect to change without noti ce to students, those students who are in clinical rotations at the time of the change will be accommod ated for the du ration of the rotation when possible. Rotation sit es will be upda ted annually. 5.5.3 Selective Rotations If the stude nt decides to exercise the option of compl eting one (1) of the fourth - year Selectives away from their R egional Sit e, the student must arra nge for the Selective rotation a s they would for an ele ctive. 5.5.4 Rural and Underserved Rotation s The third -year Ru ral and Underserved rotation may be e ither at a rur al site or a non-rural under served site. Rural and und erserved area s are usu ally, but not always, d esignated or qua lify as a H PSA (He alth Professiona l Short age Ar ea) or MUA (Medically Underserved Area) thr ough federal or st ate stand ards. Third - year Rural and Unde rserved rotations must be in a primary care medi cal field such as Family M edicin e, Inte rnal M edicin e, or P ediatrics should be compl eted at a n appr opriate facility or earing a f ully e xecuted af filiation 108 agreement at the R egional Site. These should be per formed at outpatient c linics: outpati ent Family M edicine, Internal M edicine or P ediatrics. The Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator for Third Year ca n assist you in identifying a Ru ral/Underserved site a nd you can also review the regional AHEC site at www.ncahec.ne t. 5.5.5 Electives In order to uphold the credibility of CUSOM students, it is necessary to maintain elective commitments. If a student must cancel an elective, they must first notify the Office of Clinical Affairs, no later than 4 (four) weeks prior to the start of that rotation. Cancellations will not be accepted after that time. This policy is necessary because many hospitals reserve elective slots for students and may turn away students from other schools. Withdrawal on short notice means a desirable rotation slot is was ted. This is unfair to the hospital and more importantly, it is unfair to fellow students. Any changes received after the deadline must be accompanied by official documentation certifying the student has been cancelled by the physician/hospital originall y registered. A letter from the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs stating the student is in good standing, immunizations are current, and proof of coverage by CUSOM's malpractice insurance will be sent for each outside elective rotation. Students must arrange their own electives with the Regional Site Student Medical Education Coordinator. Questions regarding the scheduling of third- or fourth - year rotations should be directed to the respective Regional Site Student Medical Education Coordinator or the appropriate CUSOM Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator. Although it is preferred that students schedule their elective rotation for four consecutive weeks, some rotations may be split elective rotations into two 2 -week rotations. The specific rotations eligible for two -week rotations and limitations of this option are reviewed in Section 5.3 of this Bulletin . 5.5.6 Elective and O ther Rotations Information regarding the scheduling of Elective and Selective rotations may be found in Section 5.3.5 of this Bulletin . Rotation approval forms for requested Elective, Selective , or other rotations must be submitted to the Office of Clinical Affairs a minimum of sixty ( 60) days before the beginning of the requested rotation. Many clinical sites req uire a list of do cuments in o rder to p articipate in a rotation at their site s. This may include but is not limit ed to: Letter of Good Standing (also known a s LOGS - states your acade mic standing, BLS & A Immuniz ation flu vacc ination, e tc.), Crimin al Background Check, 109 Drug ersity's Proof of Li ability/Malpra ctice Cov erage For liability reasons, the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs will not release the proof of liability/malpractice coverage but can release this information, in one form or another, to a requesting entity only for the purposes of clinical coordination. In order to facilitate the provision of these documents to the clinical site, students must provide the following information to the student medical education clinical coordinator for fourth year: Name, title, fax number , and em ail address of contact person Name of healthcare or medical edu cation institution requesting documentation A list of the document ation the entity is specifically requesting ** No travel plans regarding away rotations should be made by the student until they have received official approval from the Office of Clinical Affairs and notice of a fully executed affiliation agreement. ** 5.5.7 Family Medicine Preceptor Rotations Rotations must be s cheduled for f our (4) c onsecutive we eks with a n office-based or resid ency-based family physici an. The physi cian ed Out-of-State Rotations All out -of-state rotations are subj ect to the State Author ization and Reciprocity Act. This is federal legislation requiring states to abide by state-assigned law which may require students doing either online education or distance learning to obtain the formal permission of the state to serve as a clinical practicum or medi cal clerkship within their state. Each state has a differe nt requirement for state authori zation or approval. The federal penalty for violating the State Author ization and Reciprocity Act is loss of federa l educa tion fundin g for the tional institu tions, including CUSOM. Stude nts desiring to participate in a clinical rotation outside of the state of North Carolina must work with the Office of Clinical Affairs to ensure all conditions of the State Autho rization and Reciprocity Act are met. This is in addi tion to the completion of the Away Rotation R equest form and submission of all required documentatio n. The process for requesting out-of-state c linical rotations is a s follows: Compl ete the Affiliation Agreement Request form, available from the Office of Clini cal Affairs on CUSOM's web -based evaluation system , between six (6) months and no less than sixty (60) days prior to the start of the rotation. 110 Clinic al Affairs will review the compl eted form and work with the Provost 's Office staff to establish n ecessa ry state approvals to complete the rotation. Clinic al Affairs will noti fy the student of the status of the request at least thirty (30) d ays prior to the start of the rotation . Any further questions or concerns regarding CUSOM 's policy on the State Author ization and Reciprocity Act should be sent to the Office of Clin ical Affairs. 5.5.9 International R otations Specific information regarding the scheduling of international rotations may be found in Section 5.3.10 of this Bulletin . A limited number of international rotations are available for fourth -year Elective Rotations. International Medical Mission rotation s must be at CUSOM -affiliated sites and approved in advance by the Department of Community and Global Health, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, the Dean, and the Campbell University Study Abroad Committee. A signed affiliation agreement between CUS OM and the internationa l organization must be in place at least ninety ( 90) days prior to the clinical rotation. CU SOM does not assume any liability for health or safety while on international rotations. All international experiences must compl y with CUSOM poli cies for international rotations. Requirements for students wishing to do a n international rotation include : Must be in good acade mic standing Must h ave taken and passed COMLEX-USA Level 1 Must have approval of the rotation from the Department of Communi ty and Glob al Health, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, the Dean, and the Campbe ll Univ ersity Study Abro ad necessa ry immuni zations, pa ssport, and other requirements for travel. Students are responsible for obtaining travel insurance, including evacu ation coverage and must be presented with the required forms for international travel. Stu dents must have completed the Travel Safety SDL and electroni cally sign to show unde rstanding of safe practic e in foreign country prior to t ravel. At the completion of the rotation, the student m ust prepare a written case report from his/h er clinical experience abroad (no more than two pages, topic pertinent to the country of rotation, e.g., tropi cal diseases, occupa tional inju ries, R otation Information M ilitary Rotations All students in the Military may serve certain rotations in the Military with approval by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. A copy of the military orders must be presented to the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs for approval. 111 5.5.11 Away Rotation Requests All students desiring to compl ete elective rotations away from their designated CUSOM regional sites must complete an affiliation agreem ent request form. A hyperlink to this form may be found on CUSOM 's web -based evaluation system. All affiliation agree ment requests must be subm itted in a timely manner (at least sixty ( 60) days prior to the start of a domestic r otation/at least 90-180 days for all international rotations) . Unauthorized Rotations: Any student starting an Elective or Selective rotation without a fully executed affiliation agreement with the Office of Clinic al Affairs will not receive credit for that ro tation, and all violations will be subject to review by the Academic Performa nce, Promotion a nd Standa rds Committe e. For questions regarding the process, students s hould contact their clinical campus student medical education coordi nator or the CUSOM s tudent medical education clinical coordina tors f or third -year or fourth -year. 5.5.12 Scheduling Away R otations Many elective rotations for fourth- year are scheduled through VSLO (Visiting Student Learning Opportunities) and Clinician Nexus. Information regarding using VSLO and Clinician Nexus to schedule rotations may be obtained from the student medical education clinical coordinator for fourth year. Additional information regarding VSLO is also available on CUSOM's web -based evalu ation system. 5.5.13 Addition al Rotation I nformation Timely Approval It is extremely impor tant that students complete their affiliation agreeme nt requests on time. Failure to submit the appropriate forms within the timeframe allotte d may result in your r otation being chosen for you by your Regional Site Student Medical Education Coordina tor and R egional D ean. No rotation may be started without being a pproved (see Unauthori zed Rotations). Unauthoriz ed Rota tions Any student starting an Elective or Selective rotation without a fully executed affiliation agreement with the Office of Clinic al Affairs will not receive credit for that ro tation and all viol ations will be subject to review by the Acade mic Performa nce, Promotion and Standards Committe e. Fo r questions regarding the process, students should contact their Regional Site Student Medical Education Coordi nator or the Student Medi cal Edu cation Coordina tors f or the Third Year or Fourth Year . 112 5.6 General Policies and Procedures - Clinical Rotations 5.6.1 Overview Medical stud ents will w ork directly unde r the supervision of an attending physician. A licens ed physician must countersign all entries in the patient record. Students must clearly identify themselves in the medi cal record as either an MS -3 or an MS -4 student. Histo ry & Physicals: Students are responsible for all assigned H&Ps, including osteopathic stru ctural exams. P receptors will review student performance and provide constructive feedback to assist in improvement . Procedures: Students may, only with direct supervision, perform a procedure in the presence of a licensed physician. Under NO circumst ances are students to attempt a procedure without direct supe rvision. Rounds: The student's direct supervisor will provide the schedule to make rounds on each service. Students are expected to be prompt and prepared to discuss the status of patients and any results/ reports which may have been received. This is the time to ask questions. Students should not be afraid to speak up if there is something needing clarification . Morning Report: Many services will have a morning report, where the \"on- call\" house staff will report on the events of each patient during the night. This is also where the chief resident will make assignments for the day. There is usually an education al component during this time. This conference is MANDAT ORY if the student is on a service with morning report. BE ON TIME and be prepared. Procedure Workshop, Simulation or Skills Lab : Occasional ly during the rotation or at the clinical training site, workshops or \"skills labs\" will be given to enhance procedura l or OMT training . Atte ndanc e is MANDATORY. I f assigned, students are expected to attend and be prepared. Didactics: Each service and clinical site has its own didactic schedule, which will be provide d the first day on service. Atte ndance at all didac tic sessions is MANDA TORY. In the event a student is outside a 30-minute travel radius from the site, teleconferenc e options are available for lectures scheduled for one hour, such as noon conferences and morning report. Students must be in- person for half -day didactic programming at their respective clinical campus. I f students ar e performi ng dutie s related to the rotation, such as participating in a surgica l case or delivery, the student MUST communi cate with the Reg ional Site C oordinator the explanation for the absence. 113 Evaluations : Please remind the preceptor to complete their student evaluation in the web-based evaluation s ystem. All evaluations are to be compl eted online and must be compl eted in a timely fashion as not ed in Section 5.9.4 of this Bulletin. Prior to completion of the r otation, students are expected to compl ete evaluations of the rotation and of the preceptor . Compl etion of these evaluations are required, as this information is utilized in an anony mous fashion to provide valuable feedback and assist CUSOM in its effort to constantly improve its clinical rotation program. A rotation will be regarde d as Incomplete (IC) until the student rotation evaluation has been compl eted. Any specific preceptor or rotation concer n should not wait for documentation in the end-of-rotation evaluation but should be brought to the immedia te attention of the Regional Dean or Asso ciate Dean for Clinic al Affairs. Electronic Health Record: At most training sites, students will receive a Username and Password for accessing the EHR in use on that rotation. With this, students will be able to access protected personal health information. Students must sign a \"confidentiality agreement\" to rec eive this access. DO NOT use others' U sernames and P asswords. This is a HIPAA violation and may carry legal penalties. Confi dentiality: All rotating students must sign a Confi dentiality and Non- Disclosure Agreement. This agreement will allow the stude nt to receive a Username and Passwo rd for comput er access for the above applications. Conf identiality policies also apply to non-electronic patient information - all must be protected and shared only with those who have a profession al need- to-know. 5.6.2 Responsibilities and Duties The student, while on a rotation service, will at all times be responsible to the personnel in charge of the service involved. In addition, all students will be expected to comply with the general rules establish ed by the hospital or clinic at which they are being trained. All problems or difficultie s should be communi cated imme diately to the Regional Dean/DSME and the CUSOM Office of Clinic al Affairs. As discuss ed in previous sections of this Bulletin , students must attend all hospital confere nces related to their rotation service. In addition, students should attempt to attend any other hospit al conferences or education al programs of interest (with appropriate super visor pe rmission). A s chedule of the hosp ital education al programs should be obtaine d each week or month from the hospital Department of Medical Education. Morning report attendance is mandatory. 114 Any time spent away from the hospi tal/clinic during regular duty hours for lectures, conferences, and other progra ms conducte d at local hospital/clinic or university must be approved as noted e lsewhere in this Bulletin . Althoug h patient care assignments take precedence over lectu res and conferences, the hospital and attending physicians are encour aged to allow the students to attend scheduled lectures. The di rector of the individual clinical service must approve absences fr om c linical dut y in advance. 5.6.3 Standa rds of Professional Con duct Appropriate behavior regarding patients, staff, and other clinicia ns is expected in all situations. P receptors are encouraged to report any attendance, appear ance, or behavioral probl ems to the R egional Dean/DSME and Office of Clinic al Affairs immedia tely. As healthcare practitioners, students are required to conform to the highest stand ards of ethical and pro fession al condu ct. Th ese include , but ar e not limite d to: Respect of colleagues, staff, patients, & faculty Flexibilit y Academic integrity Honesty & trustwo rthiness Accountabili ty for personal actions & ral compet ency Students are exp ected to adhere to the s ame high ethical and pr ofession al standards required of p racticing physi cians. The pr ofession al conduc t of students is e valuated on an ongoing ba sis thr oughout the didac tic and clinical years of the CUSOM pr ogram. Violations of sta ndards of c onduc t are subj ect to faculty review a nd may be referred to the Ac ademic P erformance, Promotion and Sta ndards (APPS) Committee . 5.6.4 Preceptor - Stude nt Interactions The student should maintain a professional relationship with the preceptor and at all times adhere to appropriate professional boundaries. Contact through web- based social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) should be avoided. Career networking through professional sites, such as LinkedIn, is acceptable. All students shall refrain from any inappropriate relationship with students/faculty/staff/preceptors to the extent that the relationship may compromise any policies or expectations of the University. Inappropriate relationsh ips include any romantic or physically intimate liaison with a student outside the bonds of marriage. 115 5.6.5 Dress Code CUSOM recogniz es the in mainta ining an atmosphe re conducive to the deliver y of qua lity h ealth care. Students are always expected to d ress in a p rofession al and appropriate manner in accor dance with Section 6.5 of this Bulletin . Please note, business attire is appropriate for all clinical rotations. Men are required to wear a shirt and a tie with s lacks or khakis unless otherwise directed by their clinical preceptor. Thin strap or racer back tank tops must be covered with a sweater or jacket. Low cut or strapless tops or dresses are not permitted. Jeans, T -shirts and flip -flops are not permitted. Closed -toe shoes are required. Shoes should be professional (no tennis shoes), comfortable and functional. You must be able to stand in them for hours at a time and run if necessary. The student must w ear professiona l attire as desc ribed in th e Section 6.5 of this Bulletin. CLEAN short, white lab coats with a Campbell University patch are required at all times. If the CUSOM embroidered lab coat is dirty, students are permitted to wear a non- Campbell -issued short, white lab coat until the original coat is cleaned. Students must wear their CUSOM ID badge at all times as noted below. On serv ices where scrubs are indi cated, they will be provi ded by the training facility. S crubs are not to be w orn outside of the t eaching fa cility. Stud ents will wear appropriate p rofession al attire to and from the institution. Approved identi fication will be worn as dict ated by each training facility. Students are required to car ry their CUSOM identifica tion (ID) badges at all times. In cases of lost ID badges, students must contact CUSOM to obtain a new ID badge. If students arrive without a lab coat or are inappropriately dressed, they may be asked to leave the rotation and may NOT be allowed to participate in clinical activities. This may result in an unexcused absence and will require further action and review by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Inappropriate dress may also be considered a professionalism issue and may be referred to the APPS Committe e. Good personal hygiene is expected. Do not wear overpowering cologne or perfume . Scrubs are to be worn ONLY on surgical services. They are not to be worn home or into the hospital from outside. New scrubs must be worn daily. Surgical head and footgear is not to be worn outside of the operating room area. Failure to adhe re to these standa rds of dress and grooming may result in corrective action as noted above. 116 5.6.6 Supe rvision of Students A student on c linical rotations must be super vised in all patient care situ ations. Supervision involv es a responsible licensed physi cian to: Be physically located in t he facility where patient treatment is r endered Grant authori zation of s ervices provide d by the student doc tor Examine all patients seen by the student do ctor Witness procedures when performed by the stude nt doc tor Assure that the doc ument ation in the patient's medi cal record is appropriate 5.6.7 Stude nt Problems / Issu es The Office of Clinical Affairs makes every effort to ensure all clinical rotations are positive learning experiences. H owever, if any problems/concerns arise during the clinical years, students should contact the Office of Clinical Affairs for assistance as soon as any concerns arise. In addition, counseling services are available to all students on rotations as noted in Section 5.8.3 of this Bulletin. If a p receptor suspects or identifies problems with a student's progress, professionalism or performance they are to c ontact the Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Affairs. All reports will be thor oughly inve stigated and, should action be tak en, the appropriate procedures, as outlined in Section 6.7 of this Bulletin , will be followed. Examples of such problems may include, but are not limited to: Poor interpersonal skills (i.e., personality problems, etc.) Deficient clinical skills Below a verage acad emic performance Unexcused absenteeism Medical or psychological illness Suspected subst ance abuse (alcohol a nd ot her drugs) Suspected illegal behavior Suspected physical, s exual, or emotional a buse If at any time, the Office of Clinical Affa irs or other faculty mem ber feels a student is unfit physically, m entally, or emotionally to care f or patients, the student will be removed from rotations and required to meet with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs to determine t he appropriate course o f action. If a student has concerns about his/her own well -being, they should contact the O ffice of Clinic al Affairs and access CUSOM provided counseling services. 117 5.6.8 Letters of Recommendation The Office of Clinical Affairs does not provide letters of recommendation for students seeking post -doctoral training. Students should identify faculty members who will advocate for their suitability in the various specialties. Letters of recommendation should be forwarded directly to the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS). Do not have these letters sent to the Office of Clinical Affairs. CUSOM will provide the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) as part of all student residency applications. As the name signifies, this is a standardized instrument of evaluation a nd not a letter o f recommendation. 5.6.9 Stude nt Files Student evaluations are available for rev iew acc ording to CUSOM policy. Grades cannot be given by phone. Student evaluations and gra des are maintained in the Office of C linical Affairs. Student files are CONFIDENTIAL and will not b e cop ied by personnel o f the Office o f Clinical Affairs or sent to another party for externship/internship applications. However , students will be allowed to copy t heir own evalua tions. Student transcripts will remain under the aegis of the Registrar's Office. C omments provided by preceptors on the s tudent end- of-rotation evaluation will be included in the Dea n's Letter (MSPE ). 5.6.10 History and Physicals CUSOM believes in the importance of an ed ucationally sound, realistic policy pertaining to student performa nce of histories and phys icals (H&P' s) at affiliated tra ining sites. I deally, t he H&P policy should b e the same for all student s. However, we realize t he sove reignty of our affiliated hospitals and acknowle dge our policy must be int egrated with individual hospital policy. Ideally, the student should complete at least two H&P's per day on the assig ned service. Clinical preceptors shou ld critique the H&P with feedback to the student. The student should have time and the opportunity for p atient follow -up. The Office of the Director of Medical Education and Regional Dean/DSME are responsible for the H&P policy for each hosp ital. If a student has any questions or concerns regardi ng the pol icy or t heir role as a student, they should contact the Regional Dean/DSME or t he Director of Medical Education Office of the affiliated hospital. The Director of Medical Educat ion or Regi onal Dean/DSME for each s pecific hospital will make clear to t he student the policy of that hospital for student order writi ng. As students are not licensed physici ans, all activities (orders, 118 any patient care, procedures, p rogress notes, etc.) in the clinical setting are under the supervision of an attendi ng phys ician who assumes responsibility for the student. are stro ngly e ncouraged to complete str uctural examinations on a ll patients and ren der osteopathic manipulative treatment as indicated. 5.6.11 Prescription W riting Students may write o r input electronic prescription information for the preceptor, but the physician must sign/send all pre scriptions. The student's name is not to ap pear on t he prescription. F or clinical rotation sites which use electronic prescriptions, the precept or MUST l og into the sys tem under his/her own Password and personally s ign and send the electroni c prescription. 5.6.12 Medical C are & Medi cation Samples Students may not seek medi cal care from a preceptor, his/he r colleagues, or staff. The o nly exception is emergency situations where the preceptor is the only qualified licens ed provi der to give care. Students may not take any medicatio n or supplies from a clinical rotation site for personal use. Any student violating these guidelines on drug samples will autom atically fail that rotation and may result in referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee. 5.6.13 Heal th Insu rance Portability phys icians must be co gnizant of HIPAA. This will be in accordance with the traini ng institution rules and regulations and state and federal regulations as they a pply. HIPAA training will be completed by the student prior to starting clinical rotations. Any HIPAA violation will be taken very s eriously and may result in referral to the Acad emic Performan ce, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Commit tee. 5.6.14 Medi care Policy The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) revised the Medicare Claims Processing Manual in early 2018 to update policy on Evaluation and Management (E/M) documentation to allow the teaching physician to verify in the medical record any student doc umentation of components of E/M services, rather than re- documenting the work. Students may document in the medical record. However, the teaching physician must verify in the medical record all student documentation or findings, including history, physic al exam, and/or medical decision making. The teaching physician must personally perform (or re -perform) the physical exam and medical decision 119 making activities of the E/M service being billed but may verify any student documentation of them in the medica l record rather than re- documenting this work. Following is a link to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which provides direct access to CMS rules regarding student documentati on: 5.6.15 Change of Address Students must notify the Office of Clinical Affairs and the Registrar o f any change in maili ng address duri ng the clinical rotation years. This may be done via Wufoo at: https://cuweb.wufoo.com/forms/q13bwqys0t4m5h9/ Students m ay contact the Office of Clinical Affairs a t: Campbell Un iversity School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM) Office of Clinic al Affairs 4350 U S Hwy Office of Clinical Affairs will use CUSOM email as an official form of communication with students during clinical rotations. All students are required to check their CUSOM email daily i ncluding weekend/holi days while on all rotations and to respond to email requests within twenty -four (24) hours . Stude nts are asked to acknowl edge any email sent specifically to them (non-group emails) with a simple reply to ensure the email was received. If a student is located in a site with no/lim ited internet access, they must inform the Office of Clinic al Affairs im mediately. 5.6.17 Cell Phone Calls / Text Messages It is inappropria te, unprofessional, and disrespectful to te xt message, ch eck social media sites or email, or u se cell phone s or any ot her devices for purposes other than educational in nature while on clinical rotations. If the precept or approves, e lectronic devices with int ernet capabilities may be us ed as a clinical res ource (i.e., medical applications). Students who text message or use the ir cell phone with internet access for non -educat ional purposes will be disciplined for unp rofes sional condu ct, and their behavior may also be reflected in a negative ev aluation fr om the preceptor. 120 5.6.18 Social Media Students may not post any p atient or rotation -specific information on social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, etc). Contact through we b-based social networking sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) should be avoided with all employees of clinical sites as well as program faculty an d staff. Career networki ng through professional sites, such as LinkedIn, is accep table. Students should NEVER post any patient -related information or commentary even if the patient name is not included. Students should avoid all perception of impropriety, such as pictures suggesti ng com promisin g states or alcohol. Violation of these gui delines may result in referral of the stude nt to the Academic Performance Prom otion and Standards (APPS) Committee. 5.6.19 Other Regulations and Procedures The study and training of each student during assignment to a training institution shall be governed by the followi ng regulations: A licensed physician m ust supervise students. Students shall assume responsibility for , and perform , their assigned duties in accordance with the training institution regulatio ns. Students shall not be permitted to accept financial compensation or any form of gratuity for ren dering patient care. Students should be assigned to specific p atients. H&P exams should be completed on those patients whom students will be following on the service they are ass igned. Emphasis will b e placed on the teaching and applica tion of osteopathic principles and practice. Palpation and structural diagnosis in the narrative form shall be an integral part of the history and phys ical examination. The student, accordi ng to the rules and regu lations of the traini ng institution, may s ign H&P's. The H&P's p erformed and documented by stu dents must be reviewed and countersig ned by the su pervising physician. Progress no tes may be written by students only under t he direct supervision of the supervising physician and must be c ountersig ned within the time required by the rules and regu lations of the training institution. Students shall not order any examinations, tests, medications, or proce dures without consulting and obtaining the prior approval of the supervising phys ician. Students shall not write prescriptions f or medici ne, devices, or anything requiri ng the authority o f a physician. Attendance by students is required at all conferences, discussions or study session s, and any other pr ograms of an educational nature designed specif ically for students and should be documented with an attendance reco rd. In a ddition, students are encouraged to attend 121 lectures for intern s and residents, provided these do not interfere with the student's own program. Students shall be requi red to participate i n the u tilization of osteopat hic manipulative treatment when ordered and supervised by the atten ding phys ician. Students shall learn and perform procedures under appropriate and proper supervision, in those areas where the training institution regulations permit such instruction. Every eff ort should be made to counsel and assist those students having difficulty in a particular service. Stude nts who are particularly adept in a specif ic service should be given additional oppo rtunities to learn at the di scretion of the appropriate supervis ing physicians and the Director of Medical Education in accordance with hospi tal or clinic regulations. Students are to condu ct themselves in a courteo us and professional manner and shall follow the dress cod e of the training institution and CUSOM at all times . 5.7 Clinical Rotations Attendance 5.7.1 Reporting f or Service On the first d ay of each rotation service, the student should report to the Regional Dean/D irector of Medical Education or a desig nee by no l ater than 8:00 am or at the time required by t he DME or t he clinical d epartment supervisor. A ny questions regardi ng specific instr uctions for reporting on t he first day of rotations should be d irected to the regional s ite student medical education coordinator or the Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator for Third - or Fourth- Year, as appropriate. Students are expected to bring their own basic diagnost ic equipment (i.e., otoscope, ophthalmoscope, steth oscope, etc.). Students must report on time, out of res pect for others' c ommitment to their education. Timeliness is a critical component of professi onalism. Tardiness will not be accep ted and will reflect n egatively on both the student and CUSOM. 5.7.2 Wor k Ho urs One hundred percent (100%) attendance on all clinical rotations is expected. Failure to notify the clinical site/preceptor, Regional Site Coordinator, Regional Dean, and the corresponding Third- or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs of any absence from a rotation, regardless of the reason or number of hours absent, may result in completion of a professionalism report with referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. An unexcused absence will result in either a failing or an incomplete grade and result in referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. 122 Students are required to be at their assigned supervised clinical education experience sites for a minimum of forty (40) hours per week. The days and times a student is expected to report is determined by the preceptor and students may be assigned to day, evening, night, weekend or holiday work hours. Preceptors may ask students to rotate their scheduled work hours in order to gain the most clinical experience during times of peak patient flow. During certain clinical rotations, students may be assigned to weekend hours as well. The Campbell University holiday schedule is independent of the clinical rotation schedule. Third - and fourth- year students must follow the schedule as outlined by their preceptor for the month. 5.7.3 Training H ours Clear communication of the expectations between students, the Office of Clinical Affairs, and the training sites will permit flexibility within reasonable limits in a way which does not impact either clinical education or reflect poorly on a student's professionalism. Four (4) weeks of vacation time is included in both the third- and fourth- years as a scheduled rotation block. Students are generally expected to work five (5) full days per week, averaging forty (40) hours weekly, but the length (hours) of some required \" shift\" schedules may be different for surgical, sub- internship, and emergency medicine rotations. Working hours in each of the services will be indicated and determined by the training site and the physician in charge of that service, in cooperation with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and the Vice- President of Medical Education/Regional Dean/DSME of the CUSOM -affiliated training site. If call, night duty, or weekend duties are required, this will be indicated by the individual rotation. The student may not substitute workday hours from one service to another and are required to remain on the clinical rotation to which he/she is assigned. A student may spend time in another department only if it is part of the assigned clinical rotation's curriculum and only with approval of their attending physician/clerkship director. For example, it is acceptable for a student in general surgery to spend time in pathology seeking tissue and biopsy results to ensure proper follow -up and continuity of ca re. It is not acceptable, however, for a student to make -up missed hours of an Obstetrics/Gynecology rotation in the Emergency Department. Any questions regarding these training hour requirements should be directed to the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. If a student works an on- call night weekend shift, he/she may be given compensatory time off at the discretion of the preceptor. Compensatory time off greater than two (2) days must be approved by the Office of Clinical Affairs. Students are not permitted to rearrange their normal working 123 schedule to allow for time off during any rotation. The only exception may be the Emergency Medicine and inpatient Hospitalist rotations in order to accommodate shift schedules, provided it has been approved by the appropriate supervising physician. Professionalism in patien t care requires reliable attendance. The Office of Clinical Affairs will centrally track the number of days off for each student. No unexcused absences can be permitted from patient care activities. As noted below , students will be given a total of thre e (3) discretionary days and five (5) Sick Days (approved absences) per academic year. Any student in violation of attendance policies with more than two (2) days per rotation or a total of five (5) days per academic year of time off (not made up) will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for further review. Student absence requests must be made utilizing the official CUSOM Absence Request / Submission form which may be obtained from the Office of Clinical Affairs or found online at: https://cuw eb.wufoo.com/forms/m63yfw91siqe 3g/ All absences, whether a current illness or a request for a future absence, must be compl eted usi ng this form. 5.7.4 Attendan ce Attendance at all scheduled workdays is mandatory. Students are expected to arrive at least fifteen (15) minutes early for each of their scheduled workdays. Any length of absence (an hour, half day, full day, etc...) must be immediately reported to the Regional Site Coordinator, Regional Dean, Director of Student Medical Education (DSME) as appropriate and the corresponding Third - or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs. Requests are to be submitted electronically via the CUSOM Absence Request/Submission Form (as identified below) to the corresponding Third - or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Cl inical Coordi nator. Extracurricular activities, vacations, or lack of childcare are NOT acceptable excuses for absences. 1. Discretionary Days Students are allowed three (3) discretionary days total annua lly. No more than one (1) day may be taken in any given clinical rotation, and discretionary days may NOT be used on a Call Back Friday (last Friday of the rotation). Dis cretionary days MUST be approved by both the 124 preceptor and Office of Clinical Affairs in writing at least one (1) week in advance to the requested t ime off. Requests are to be submi tted electroni cally via the CUSOM Absence d below) to the correspondi ng Third- or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator . 2. Sick D ays Students are allowed five (5) sick days annua lly. If more than five (5) sick days total are taken by a stude nt, the student may be referred to the Office of Clinical A ffairs and the A cademic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee for review. Students must contact their clinical site/precept or as well as the Regional Site Coordina tor, Regional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate), and either the Thi rd- or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator immedi ately if they are missing any clinical time due to illness (l eaving early, arriving late, or missing a full day). If 2-4 hours of clinical time are missed, a half day will be documented. More than four (4) hours of missed clinical time equals a full d ay of sick lea ve. If an absence of greater than one (1) working day is necessa ry due to illness, that time must be made up. A rrangements for missed time will be coordinated with the Office of Clinical Affairs through the Regional Site Coordinator. If the student is absent from a single rotation for two (2) days or more due to illness, the student is required to submit a note from a licensed heal thcare provide r to the Office of Clinical Affairs defining the number of days absent and the expected date of return. If extraordina ry circumstances require a prolonged absence (more than three (3) days in one rotation), the student may be encouraged to consider a Medical Leave of Absence whi ch can be requested through the Office of Clinical Affairs. A Medical Leave of Absence may be required for students who miss more than three (3) days due to medi cal reasons and are unable to make up the missed time prior to the end of the rotation. A Medical Leave of Absence may delay the student's graduation. Each case is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Students who require a Medical Leave of Absence will meet with the As sociate Dean for Clinical Affairs and the Dean, and may be referred to the A cademic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Commi ttee. A Mo dified Course of Study will be developed in discussion with the As sociate Dean for Clinical Affairs. 125 3. Family Emergencies / D eath in Family Due to the variability of circumstances, time-off requested for family emergencies or a death in the family will be reviewed by the Office of Clinical Affairs on a case-by-case b asis. 4. Time off for R esidency Interviews Students may request no more than four (4) days off for interviews during any four -week rotation, and no more than two (2) days over any two-week rotation. This includes partial day absences of greater than four (4) hours. Students will be required to make up missed time at the rotation director's discretion. All requests for time -off must include written verification of the interview location and date and be provided to the Office of Clinical Affairs at least one (1) week prior to the requested date of absence. As noted previously, permission for time off for internship/residency interviews must be granted in advance with the aforementioned offices. 5. Conferences Additional excused time off ma y be granted only if the student is presenting, is a national officer, or by special permission. All requests for conferences need prior approval by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs as noted above. Students are required to make up time off for conferences. Only students in good standing and with an overall GPA of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale at the end of the MS -2 training will be considered. In addition, in order for students to be considered for an absence to attend a conference, they must have up- to-date submissions of all clinical rotation evaluations, site evaluations, and clinical experience database logs. Educational presentations, such as posters or research, may be considered toward meeting the required contact hours for the rotation at the discretion of the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Failure to notify the clinical site/preceptor, Regional Site Coordinator, Regional Dean, an d the corresponding Third- or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs of any absence from a rotation, regardless of the reason or number of hours absent, may result in completion of a professionali sm report with referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. 126 Extracurricular activities, vacations, or lack of childcare are NOT acceptable excuses for absences. Email is the primary method of communication between the De partment of Clinical Affairs and students, and, thus, students must check their CUSOM email regularly. Students are required to attend all onsite meetings designated by the Regional Site Coordinator or Regional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate). Permission f or an absence must be obtained in advance with all of the following: CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs, Clinical preceptor to wh om s tudent is assigned, and Regional Dean/DSME of the a ffiliated hos pital. Student absence requests must be made utilizin g the official CUSOM Absence Request / Submission form and may be obtaine d from the Office of Clinical Affairs or found onl ine a t: https://cuw eb.wufoo.com/forms/m63yfw91siqe 3g/ All absences, whether a curren t illness or a request for a future absence, must be completed using this form. There are no exceptions for this procedure and failure to follow the procedure will result in the student being assigned an unexcused absence. Students who miss more than a total of four (4) days of a 4- week rotation, or two (2) days of a 2- week rotation, regardless of the reason, and who are unable to make up the missed time prior to the end of the rotation, may not receive credit for the rotati on and will be required to appear before the APPS Committee. Failure to notify the clinical site/preceptor, Regional Site Coordinator, Regional Dean, and the corresponding Third- or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs of any absence from a rotation, regardless of the reason or number of hours absent, may result in completion of a professionalism report with referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. If a student desires to participate in an activity that will take him/her away from an assigned clinical setting, the student must submit a written request fully explaining the nature of the activity identified in the request and detail ing the time away from assigned duty. This request must be submitted to the Office of the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs at least two (2) working days (weekdays), before the requested absence. Failure to notify the clinical site/preceptor, Regional Site Coordinator, Regional Dean, and the 127 corresponding Third- or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs of any absence from a rotation, regardless of the reason or number of hours absent, may result in completion of a professionalism report with referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. 5.7.5 Make-Up Time Students must be available to make up anticipated time off at the discretion of the rotation preceptor in order to maintain compliance with the CUSOM attendance policy. If a student's absence results in missing an examination, the student will retake the exam at the discretion of the Office of Clinical Affairs. Students who miss more than a total of four (4) days of a four -week rotation, or two (2) days of a two -week rotation, regardless of the reason, and who are unable to make up the missed time prior to the end of the rotation will be called to the APPS Committee. Failure to notify the clinical site/prec eptor, Regional Site Coordinator, Regional Dean, and the corresponding Third - or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs of any absence from a rotation, regardless of the reason or number of hours absent, may result in completion of a professionalism report with referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. 5.7.6 Call Ba ck Fridays Students are required to return to Campbell University on the last Friday of the following core clinical rotations: Family Medicin e, Internal Medicine II, Obstetric s/Gynecology, Pediatric s, Psychiatry, Surgery, and Em ergency Medicine. During these sessions, end-of-rotation exams are tak en, and rotation specific pr e-preparation activities occur includi ng, but application; and inte rprofessional events. Full attendance and participation in the entire day is MANDATORY. These sessions typically are scheduled from 8am-5pm; therefore, students should NOT make any travel plans prior to 5pm . These times m ay be subject to change. In the event of illness, BOTH the end-of-rotation exam and the rotation specific pre-preparation activities must be compl eted in order to receive credit for compl etion of the rotation. Any emergency requiring absence from a Call Back Friday must be communicated to the corresponding Third- or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs immediately. 128 Fourth Year Call B ack Requirements Attendance and active participation in a minimum of two (2) on- campus Call Back Friday OMM workshops is required during the fourth year. The first will occur during Residency Development Month, where the students are required to perform an OMM specific OSCE in a simulated outpatient setting. The second will occur when students return to campus to take their core emergency medicine end -of-rotation exam, and the students are required to attend an OMM workshop structured to help them develop strategies for integrating OMM into their post- graduate education. Students are always encouraged to attend additional Call Back Friday activities as space allows . 5.7.7 Holid ays While on clinical rotations, students are excused only for holidays which are observed by their respective clinical site. If a student is assigned by a preceptor to work on a holiday, the student may NOT reque st the use of a discretionary day on that holiday. Third - and fourth -year students are required to follow the training site (e.g., hospital, clinic, office, health center) policies and procedures regarding holidays. All major holidays are observed at the discretion of the affiliated training site and must be reported to the Office of Clinical Affairs. Students may request an excused absence for religious holidays not included in the list of recognized University holidays. If a student is required to work on a holiday, the student may be given a compensatory day off during the holiday week at the discretion of the Vice President of Medical Education/ Regional Dean/ DSME. 5.7.8 Jury Duty It is the duty of every cit izen to serve on jury duty when called.

As noted above, in the cases of Jury Duty, the absence request and supporting docu mentation must be submitted to Clinical Education at least seven (7) days prior to the anticipated absence. 129 Consequences of Non-compliance to Attendance policies As professionals, students are expected to strictly adhere to the attendance policy. For third - or fourth -year students any unexcused absence while on clinical rotation will automatically result in a failure for that rotation and the student will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion an d Standards (APPS) Committee. In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program. 5.7.9 Severe Weather P olicy In the case of severe weather while on clinical rotations, students should follow the severe weather protocol of their specific clinical site . If the preceptor is present, the student should make every attempt to be present. If the student is unable to get to the clinical site due to unsafe road conditions, the student must communicate this to their preceptor, their Regional Site Coordinator and the Third - or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator immediately. Any time missed due to s evere weather must be made up at the discretion of the preceptor, Regional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate), and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, keeping in mind that students must complete the requirements for a four -week rotation block in order to receive credit for their rotation. See Section 6.4.4 of this Bulletin for more information. 5.7.10 Emergency Plan Policy See Section 6.4.5 of this Bulletin for more information. 5.7.11 Dismissal from Rotation Site In the event a student is asked to leave the rotation or rotation site by the preceptor or clinical site staff, the student must IMMEDI ATELY notify the Regional Dean/DSME and the Office of Clinical Affairs (Associate Dean for Clinic al Affairs, Director of Clinical Rotations, Stude nt Medical Education Clinic al Coordina tors for Third Year or Fourth Year) in person or by phone . In addition, this communi cation must be follo wed by written documentation of the events and sent to the site coordi nator and Office of Clinic al Affairs within the ensuing twenty four ( 24) hours. 5.8 Clinical Rotations Health and Wellness 5.8.1 Immunization Record It is the responsibility of the student to have completed all immunization requirements/records as required in the CUSOM matriculation agreement. Failure to do so will jeopardize starting or ongoing participation in clinical 130 rotations. The student will a lso be responsible for keeping their PPDs current according to the guidelines set forth by the CDC (within one (1) year of their last PPD). This documentation pertaining to the update must be submitted to the Office of Clinical Affairs prior to the studen t continuing on their rotation schedule. Students who do not comply with this policy will be removed from rotations and any absence for this reason will be considered unexcused and handled according to polices reviewed elsewhere in this Bulletin . 5.8.2 Heal th Servi ces CUSOM students are able to utilize the Campbell University Health Center for confidential medical and confidential personal health concerns. Student Health Center office hours are published and distributed to students at the start of each academic year and may be found online at: https://www.campbell.edu/health-center/ All students are required to have health insurance at the time of matriculation and maintain health insurance coverage through graduation. Students are required to either enroll in Campbell University's health insurance plan (https://www.campbell.edu/students/student -health -insurance/ ) or provide proof of active health insurance coverage obtained through another company. Students without active health insurance coverage will not be permitted to participate in any patient care clinical activities. For medical emergencies and after -hours health care, students are encouraged to access appropriate care as warranted by their situation which may include local urgent care facilities, Eme rgency Departments , and Emergency Medical Services. In an emergency, students should access EMS and the 911- dispatch system. For students on Clinic al Rotations away from CUSOM needing health services, assistan ce may be obtained anytime by contacting the Regional Dean/DSME or the CUSOM Offi ce of Clinic al Affairs. CUSOM will assume no financial responsibility for injur ies (e.g., accidental needle sticks, burns, laceration, etc.) or medi cal/su rgical problems incurred either on or off a clinical rotation. F or this reason, the student is required to keep in force a health insur ance policy throug hout every year in attendance at CUSOM. Proof of insurance information is to be provide d to the Office of Clinic al Affairs yearly and upda ted on an ongoing basis if there are any changes in coverage. 131 5.8.3 Counseling Services Confidential counseling services are available 24 -hours -a-day, seven -days-a- week in a confidential manner through a combination of resources which includes clinical services offered by the CUSOM Department of Behavioral Health (CUSOM BH) under the leadership of the Departmental Chair and Clinical Director (https://me dicine.campbell.edu/behavioral-health ), and StudentLinc, a stu dent assistance pro gram. Working with Academic and Student Affairs, the Director of Behavioral Health, a licensed mental health professional, and other CUSOM Behavioral Health clinical staff are available during normal business hours for direct student contact. CUSOM Behavioral Health clinical staff are also available as a point -of-contact for after -hours issues in conjunction with StudentLinc described below. CUSOM Behavioral Health clinical staff provide counseling for CUSOM students in two (2) on- campu s locations based on student preference: Leon Levine Hall and the Campbell Health Center (129 T.T. Lanier Street). S tudents are advised of the location of this service and how to access behavioral health services during Orientation as well as periodically throughout the year. More information regarding Behavioral Health services may be found at: https://me dicine.cam pbell.edu/behavioral-health Students on clinical rotations who are unable to travel to the on- campus locations can meet with a CUSOM Department of Behavioral Health counselor via WebX, a secure videoconferencing system which meets HIPAA and FERPA standards. This approach makes communication with, and counseling for, CUSOM student s on rotations much more accessible and convenient. Students may also utilize video, phone , or web -based counseling through StudentLinc. Counseling is encouraged for students experiencing anxiety, academic stress, relationship problems, loneliness, depre ssion, alcohol or substance abuse, sexuality conflicts, test anxiety , and concerns related to medical school adjustment. Students may self -refer or may be identified by and referred to CUSOM Behavioral Health by others, all in a confidential manner. For students found to have needs beyond those provided via CUSOM Behavioral Health, confidential referrals are made to appropriate community health providers by CUSOM Behavioral Health or StudentLinc. In addition to Behavioral Health clinical staff, CUSOM utilizes the services of StudentLinc, a 24/7/365 student assistance program offering wrap -around psychosocial support services. 132 Services are accessed through StudentLinc's online web portal: https://www .mystude ntlinc.com/ or via their mobile application.

Students on Clinical Rotations away from CUSOM needing health services are provided with site -specific or rotation -specific guidelines for accessing health care and assistan ce (for referral information) m ay be obtained anytime by contacting the Regional Dean/DSME or the CUSOM Of fice of Clinic al Affairs. For emergency situations, students should call 9-1-1. For non- emergency situations Monday through Friday 9am -5pm, student should call Campus Safety and ask for the Behavioral Health practitioner. After 5pm and on weekends and holidays, student should contact StudentLinc. 5.8.4 Professional Li ability Insurance All students serving on clinical rotations are covered by the profession al liability insurance of the Campbell University Health Center, LLC during their third and fourth years. Certificates of Insurance are provided to each Regional Site Student Medical Education Coordinator when requested. Liability insurance for third - and fourth -year students does not cover ac tivities which are unsupe rvised or performe d outside the scope of practic e or are not part of a CUSOM -approved clinical r otation. Any incidents which occur in the clinical interaction with patients must be reported to the clinical supervisor on- site, the Regional Dean, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, and the Campbell University General Counsel's Office at PO Box 114, Buies Creek, NC 27506, (910) 893- 1217. 133 5.8.5 Incident Reporting If at any time a student believes a patient situation may have legal implications, they should contact the Office of Clinical Affairs immediately. 5.8.6 Body F luid and N eedle Stick Policy and Proced ure Incid ents involving needle sticks and exposure to body fluids or potential blood borne pathogens require immedia te action to prot ect stu dents' h ealth and safety. If a student sustains a needle stick or is exposed to infectio us mat erials, he or she should: Imme diately wash exposure site thoroughly with soap and water (or water only for mucous me mbranes) o Wash needle stick and cuts with so ap and w ater o Flush the nose, mouth or skin with w ater o Irrigate eyes with c lean water, saline or sterile irrigating solutions Imme diately notify the preceptor or clinical supervisor at the rotation site for assistan ce Call/go to the Campbell University's Health Center or the occupational health clinic or area of the clinical facility designated for treating needl e stick exposur es. Time ly consultation concerni ng appropriate tests, risk-assess ment couns eling and chemoprophylaxis decisions a re critical. Proceed immediately to the Emergency Department for evaluation if exposure has occurred a fter normal business ho urs, or are for any other reason u nable to be evaluated at one of the a bove locations. Seek immedia te care for necessa ry lab work and post -exposure prophylaxis if indicated. In the event that the rotation site has an existing exposure policy, the student shoul d compl y with the site's poli cy. If the rotation site is not able to assist the student, the student should seek care at the nearest available facility to provide appropriate care (initial lab work for HIV, HBV, HCV and risk assessment to de termine the need for chemoprophylaxis, etc.) or students may be seen at Campbell Un iversity's Health C enter. The preceptor or appropriate institution al representative should obtain consent from the so urce patient for appropriate laboratory testin g (i.e. HIV, HBV, and HCV status). Students should receive post-exposure prophylax is within hours of the exposure , rather than days, per CDC recomm endations, if the status of the sourc e patient is deemed high risk or if there is uncer tainty of the source patient's st atus. Post-exposu re prophylaxis for HIV, when indicated, is extremely time sensitive with b est results obtain ed when treatment is begun within just a few hours of exposu re. Thu s, immediate evaluation following an incident is c ritical. 134 Some clinical sites will provide post- exposure care to students at no charge. When this is not the case, students should file a claim with their personal health insurance or Campbell University Student Health Insurance first. However, submission of insurance information should never delay an initial evaluation or in itiation of appropriate care and/or post -exposure prophylaxis. Accidental infectious exposure must also be reported to AIG : AIG Ed ucational Markets Mail Center PO Box 26050 Overland Park, KS 6622 5 Policy Numb er: CAS 9495425 When presenting to a clinic for post-exposure care, the student may provide the above polic y information and his or her student ID card. Howe ver, the site may or may not accept direct payme nt through this pl an. Students may have to pay out of pocket at the time of service. H owever, reimburs ement for s ervices up to $5,000 per incid ent can be filed via the Campbell University Hea lth Center. Students will n eed: To provide an itemized statement compl ete with diagnosis and procedure codes. Compl ete a CSAS claim form either in-person or call Campbell University Health Center at (910) 893-1560. The staff will help you fill out the form by email correspond ence. Campbell University Health Center personnel will provi de further instruction on how to compl ete and file your claim. If requested, mail documents to: Campbell Univ ersity Health C enter P.O. Creek, NC 27506 Althoug h the precept or or clinical supervisor may have contacted the CUSOM Offic e of Clinic al Affairs as indicated above , the student must also contact the CUS OM Offi ce of Clinic al Affa irs as soon a s reasonably possible. Within a minimum of seventy -two (7 2) hours of the exposure , the student must report the incid ent and then fax (910) 893-7254 a copy of the Exposure Reporting form. The incident report, Exposure Reporti ng Form - CU Health Center, shall contain: The date and time of exposure Clinic al site, location a nd unit infor mation Details of how the exposure occu rred 135 Details of the type and severity of the exposure Details about the sourc e patient (i.e. post -exposure management, previous vaccinations, c urrent HIV, HBV, HCV status) The Office of Clinical Affairs will provide a copy of the incident report to the Campbell University Health Center. This will alert the Health Center in the event that an accident insurance claim needs to be filed. In the event that an incident report was fi led at the rotation site, a copy of this must be sent to the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs to be maintained in the student's file. In the event of an exposure, the National Clinician's Post Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline is available by phone, 888- 448-4911, twenty - four hours per day, seven days per week, to provide guidance in managing exposures. 5.8.7 Infectious Dis eases While all students have had thorough training in microbiolog y and infectious diseases during the first two years of the curric ulum, it is import ant to review some basic funda ment al principles. Diseases you can cat ch in the hospital or of fice: Needle sticks, and Blood and Body Fluid Exposures Hepatitis B Hepatitis C HIV Aerosol and Droplet Exposures TB Measles Chickenpox Meningococcus Shigella Simplex S. aureus Group A Streptococcus EKC (Pink E ye) Syphilis Scabies, etc Diseases you can transmit to patients or o ther healthcare personnel: Respiratory Route TB Resistant B acteria Hepatitis B Group A Strep Clostridium di fficile 5.8.8 Important Precautions Wash Your Hands 1. Hands washed without scrub will not significantly reduce the number s resident organisms (S. epi, Corynebacteria, P. acnes, etc.) but is effective in removing transient flora, such as gram-negative bacilli and S. aureus. Antis eptic agents, such as chlorhexidine, are probably more effectiv e. 2. Always wash between different patients as well as between \"clean\" and \"dirty\" sites on the same patient. 3. Always wash hands and follow strict aseptic technique before inserting or manipulating any intravascular device or any other device, which will e nter a sterile body site. Observe Isolation P rocedures 1. Isolation procedures are based on a large body of scientific work and detailed guidelines are provided by the CDC : http://ww w.cdc.gov/hi cpac/2007 IP/2007isolati onPrecautions.html 137 2. Each isolation category specifies whether gloves, gowns, masks, and/or goggles are necessary when in c lose contact with the patient or even entering the room. 3. Isolation is intended for appropriate patients whether they are alive or deceased. This also incl udes patients and specimens derived from patients. All specimens taken from isolated p atients must be designated as isolation specim ens and placed in the appropriate protective bags. The lab must be aware a specime n is from an isolation patient as body fluids can be hazardous w hen spilled, splatt ered, or aero solized in the lab. 4. There is a copy of the infection control manual and the isolation category cards in every healthcare facility. If you are sick, don' t be a vector to patients or other healthcare workers. 1. If you are ill, c onsult a physician. 2. Wear a mask if you have a respiratory illness or stay at home. Remember to follow the C USOM policy for any absences, including those related to illness, as described elsewhere in this Manual . 3. Practice frequent handwashi ng. 4. If you have a contagious disease or have been exposed to one, inform your supervisor and the Office of Clinical A ffairs immedia tely. Use great care when handling needles or sharp instruments 1. Never attempt to r ecap a needl e. 2. Dispose of all sharps (used or unus ed) only in the red plastic containe rs. Know where the containe r is lo cated BEFORE using needles or sharp instrum ents. 3. Don't use needle cutters and don' t try to be nd or break needles. 4. Be careful when cleaning up after LP's, thorace ntesis, bone marrow biopsies or any other procedures in whi ch sha rps or needles were used. 5. Don't hide needles und er drapes or packaging. 6. Occasional ly while in the hospital or clinic, a student is accident ally stuck with a needl e, sharp or other potentia lly contaminate d infectious material. Shoul d this occur you should immediately follow the needle stick/exposure policy revi ewed previou sly in this Manual . Thoroughly clean the wound immedi ately. 8. Imme diately inform your supervisor for the particular rotation. A n incident report should be filed at the nursi ng station and a note made in the patient's chart. General Blood and Body Fluid Pr ecautions 1. Follow Univ ersal Precautions for Body Fluid E xposure at all times. 2. Use dispos able, non-sterile gloves whenever you handle blood, urine, sputum, or other potenti ally infectious material from a ny patient. 138 HIV/AIDS 1. Both ar e increasing in incidence and prevalence in the population. 2. HIV transmission has been documented due to occupa tional exposur e but is unusua l. The risk from a needl e stick is about 1 in 300, but ac tual risk d epends on a numbe r of factors. 3. In prospective studi es of 1000 mucous memb rane or skin exposur es, there has been no document ed HIV transmission. 4. No HIV transmission has been document ed with casual contact nor with fairly intima te but not s exual or parenteral exposur e. 5. If you're pregnant, or think you are, you should follow all universal precautions. S tudents who are pregnant should consult with their obstetrician for additional guidance regarding specific precautions to take while on clinical rotations. Vaccinations 1. Students are responsible for followi ng all CUSOM immuniz ation policies. 2. More detailed information can be found on the CDC 's website: http://w ww.c dc.gov/vaccines/ adults/r ec-vac/hcw.html COVID -19 Precautions Taking steps to minimize the risk of COVID -19 infections (or any other spread of disease) at Campbell is a shared responsibility. Every member of our community - including you - must do their part. This means adhering to national, state, and local health guidelines and requirements, and adhering to those measures Campbell deems safe and appropriate for its campus. Specific details will be provided as circumstances dictate, but this may include such thing as: temperature checks, social distancing, wearing masks or other facial coverings, using other PPE, not reporting to class or work if sick, and isolating and quarantining when required. You agree to do all of this not just for yourself, but for the safety of others, and because this is consistent with the spirit of Campbell. 5.9 Clinical Rotations Assessment and Grades 5.9.1 Didactics Students are expected to have a half -day of dedicated didactic experien ces per week. This consists of: Cecil's Essentials of Medicine (based on a current schedule provided to the clinical campuses) in a Jeopardy format 50 Studies Every Internist Should Know - The student will present one assigned landmark case and then present the current information of that case. Some students may have to present more than one study per year based on the clinical campus student cohort size. 139 Two (2) case presentations per year based on an interesting case in which they have been involved. COMBANK questions - 150 per rota tion. Students will complete the questions relevant to their rotation. If they exhaust those, they can repeat those questions or complete questions from other topics. These are checked for completion. DSME's and/or Regional Deans may add topics at their discretion, or at the request of their student cohorts, to enhance the half -day didactic experience. Noon conferences and morning reports are mandatory, if available at the respective clinical campus. Other clinical campus didactic offerings, such as Tumor Board and medical staff continuing medical education programs, may be mandated by the DSME and/or Regional Dean. Half-day didactic experiences are led by the third -year student cohort and facilitated by the DSME and/or Regional Dean. Fourth- year students are expected to attend didactic sessions at the institution in which they are completing a clinical rotation. If they are completing a rotation at a CUSOM clinical campus, they are expected to attend the half -day didactic programming and all other offered didactic experiences. Students are expected to complete all didactic surveys from the web -based evaluation system. This feedback will be used for future planning purposes. 5.9.2 Clinical M odules Clinical Modules including videos, lectures , and other educational materials are utilized to supplement knowledge and skill acquisition during clinical rotations. These modules are appropriate for both third- and fourth- year students and offer the learner flexibility. Modules and other educational materials supplement topics covered on clinical rotations and function as study guides for both the end-of-rotation exams, COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE and COMLEX -USA Level 2-PE. Clinical Modules are an important supplement to a student's education, but do not replace the extensive reading, studying, patient contact, etc. students must achieve on clinical rotations. Students are provided with required curricula during the third- and fourth- years. Learning objectives and corresponding reading assignments are provide d for the core discipline r otation s. 140 5.9.3 Clinical Exp erience Database (Logs) Each student will maintain a Clinical Experience Database Log so that acquisition of particular clinical skills and exposure to a broad scope of practice for each rotation can be monitored. A minimum of ten (10) procedures must be documented per rotation (with the exception of independent study electives). If the student did not observe, assist on, or perform any procedures, they are still required to submit a log form stating that no procedures were observed, assisted, or performed. Failure to maintain and submit required logs will result in an incomplete grade. Students must include all information requested on the log form. In compliance with HIPAA, no patient names or other identifiers may be included on logs. 5.9.4 Grading for Years Three and Four The primary basis for the core clinical rotation grade is the \"CUSOM Student Evaluation Form\" and the end- of-rotation exam. The end- of-rotation exam is given at the end of the four -week block for select core rotations. The CUSOM Student Evaluation Form is completed by the student's clinical faculty preceptor or that clinical campus's respective rotation clerkship director (or designee) following completion of the rotation and should be discussed with the student before submission. For rotations without an end- of-rotation exam, the student's grade is based solely on the clinical faculty's evaluation of the student. 1. Some selective and elective four-week rotations may be divided into two (2) diffe rent two-week experiences. In such cases, students will receive a grade as determined by the preceptor for each two-week experience. The overall grade for the four-week rotation will be the combi nation of the two (2) two-week experience grades. Students who fail either two-week rotation, even if the average of the two rotation evaluations results in a passing grade, will receive an FC for the entire four -week rotation block and will be cal led to the APPS Committee for re view. 2. End-of-rotation Examination End-of-rotation exams are administered after the following third - and fourth -year rotations: Internal Medicine II, Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Family Medicine, Pediatrics, Psychiatry, and Emergency Medicine. Students must pass the end- of-rotation exam to pass the rotation. Students who do not pass an end- of-rotation exam are allowed one chance to retake the exam. If the student passes the exam retake, the highest grade possible is a Pass Clinical (PC*) and t hey are not eligible for High Pass (HP) or Honors (H) for that clinical rotation. 141 If the end- of-rotation exam is failed twice, the student will receive a failing grade for the rotation (Fail Clinical, FC) and be referred to the Academic Performance, Prom otion and Standards (APPS) Committee. If the APPS Committee grants the student the opportunity to remediate the failed rotation, the entire rotation and post -rotation exam must be repeated in order to successfully remediate the rotation . If the student passes the remediation, a grade of PC* is assigned. If remediation is failed, a grade of FC is assigned. 3. Completion o f Learning Modules on C linical Rotation Various clinical rota tions, such as Pediatrics, Internal Medicin e, Family Medicin e, General Surgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, and Psychiatry utilize evidenc e-based, medi cal education online modul es to suppl ement learning in an effort to uni fy the CUSOM curriculum across all of the Regional Sites. They are mand atory/required as described in the syllabi and are mon itored by the r espective CUSOM Chairs select high-yield tional modul es for the student to c ete du ring the Clin ical Rotation. Compl etion of these modules will be required in order to pass the rotation and advance to the next Clinical Rotation. The student must compl ete all educational modul es to the required level of engagement which is verified by the respective Clinical Chair . Compl etion of learning modul es are due on the last Friday of the rotation. In extenuating circumstances, CUSOM Clinical Chairs may grant a limited time extension to complete the modules . If the learning modul es are not compl eted in the defined timeframe, the student will receive a failing grade (Fail Clinical, FC) and will be r eferred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Com mittee. 4. Preceptor Evaluation of the Student and Student Evaluation of the Preceptor All evaluations must be completed and submitted to the Office of Clinical Affairs within seven (7) days of completion of each rotation. Courses of eight (8) weeks duration (example: Internal Medicine) require an evaluation to be completed at the end of ea ch four -week block. I f a student has an approved rotation of two (2) weeks duration, the evaluation is to be completed at the end of the 2- week period. If a student does not receive a passing grade on the end- of-rotation evaluation from the preceptor, the student will fail the rotation and receive an FC grade on their transcript. Rotation grades for students who are permitted to split a four (4) week selective or elective rotation into two different two -week experiences will be the combination of the two 2-week experience grades. Students who fail either two- week rotation, even if the 142 average of the two rotation evaluations results in a passing grade, will receive an FC for the entire four -week rotation block and will be called to the APPS Committee for review. Competency -based rating forms with Entrustable Professional Activity (EPA) behavioral anchors are used by preceptors to evaluate each student's clinical skills and the application of medical knowledge in the clinical setting. A student failing a clinical rotation will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. Students failing a rotation may be required to repeat the failed rotation and be placed on a Modified Course of Study, which may delay the student's date of graduation. The CUSOM compet ency-based evaluation is based on the following core compet encies in e ach area: Osteopathic Philosoph y and Ost eopathic Manipul ative Medical Knowledge Patient Care Interpersonal Comm unication Skills Professionalism Practice-Based Learning and Improv ement System s-Based Practice In order to receive a grade for each rotation, the student must ensure the Student Evaluation Form, Site Ev aluation Form, end-of-rotation examination, rot ation learning modul es, and the clinical experience database (logs) are compl ete and received by the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs. Failure to complete any rotation requirement or submit any required rotation doc ument ation may result in a grade of Incompl ete (IC) and referral to the AP PS committee. Items wh ich may also be used to det ermine grades on clinical rotations include but are not limited to : 1. Educational modules - Lectures, cases, reading assignments and other fo rms of d elivery that may be utiliz ed in the third a nd four th year curriculum. 2. Students Logs (Procedure Logs) - Students must submit rot ation clinical patient logs and proc edure logs. 3. Question Bank Review - Students are required to compl ete COMBA NK qu estions during each clinical rot ation in order to receive c redit for the rot ation. 4. Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine - Compl etion of OMM spe cial assignments and participation in lab during C all Back Fridays for core rot ations a re required. 5. Objective Structured Clinical Performance E xamination (OSCE) and Standardized Patient (SP) Exercises - OSCE and SP exercises demonstr ate the student's ability to p erform clinical skills a nd to evaluate p atient pres entations for the most c ommon disorde rs found in adult a nd pediatric patients. 143 Multi -station OSCEs will be given a t end of fi rst, second, and third years of the CUSOM curriculum. These include taking a medi cal history, evaluating signs a nd symptoms to for mulate a dif ferential diagnosis, p erforming a physic al examination, assessing the res ults of diagnostic exa ms to e valuate and narrow a differ ential diagnosis, demonstr ating the ability to manage common medi cal scenarios, and providing appropriate documentation of the patient encounter in the form of a SOAP note. OSCE, S imulation and Clinic al Skills may also be incorporated into Call Back Fridays. Precep tor Eval uation of Student Performance A clinical faculty preceptor or a clinical campus's respective rotation clerkship director (or designee) will evaluate a student's performance during the respective rotation. The Student Evaluation Form will be completed by supervising physicians with input from appropriate hospital staff with direct knowledge of the student's performance. During the last week of each rotation the student must meet with the preceptor to review their performance and end of rotation evaluation. Based on the grading rubric, a grade of Honors, High Pass, Pass, or Fail Clinical for the preceptor evaluation will be submitted to the Registrar's Office. Students will have access to the electronic Student Evaluation Form (grade form), Site Evaluation Form, and procedure logs via the CUSOM web -based evaluation system. Completed Student Evaluation Forms are due in the Office of Clinical Affairs within seven (7) days of completion of each rotation. If the student worked with several physicians, the student should have the principal evaluator or the clinical campus's respective rotation clerkship director (or designee) submit a composite evaluation based on the input of those physicians the student worked with. Evaluations of student performance must be completed by the principal ev aluator who must be an attending physician. While resident physicians may provide input to aid the attending physician in completing the evaluation, residents are not permitted to serve as the primary evaluator. Students are not permitted to self -complet e the evaluation and submit to the evaluator for a signature. Violation of this rule or falsification of any component of the Student Evaluation Form will be considered an Honor Code violation. Violation of this policy will be subject to review by the Ac ademic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) committee and may result in a rotation failure or Incomplete (IC) grade. Any Incomplete (IC) grade will jeopardize student eligibility for financial aid and may also alter/delay their graduation date. 144 It is the student's responsibility to ensure that all clinical evaluation forms are either completed online or submitted to the Clinical Affairs Office within seven (7) days of completion of each rotation. It is the student's responsibility to expediently i nform the Office of Clinical Affairs of any difficulty in obtaining an evaluation from the preceptor at the end of the rotation. Only one Student Evaluation Form from the clinical faculty preceptor (preceptor of record), principal evaluator, rotation clerkship director (or designee) will be accepted. Students will not be permitted to add additional evaluation forms from other clinical faculty from the rotation into the final evaluation form. All submitted Student Evaluation Forms are final. Any factual or typographical errors should be reported to the Third- or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator, as appropriate. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will review and approve any requested changes. Composite Evaluations As m entioned in other sections of this bulletin, it is possible to have a Student Evaluation Form filled out by a clinical campus's respective rotation clerkship director (or designee). If such a composite evaluation is completed, it is expected the author of the evaluation form will consult with other clinical faculty, nursing staff, and members of the healthcare team who interacted with the student during the clinical rotation to provide accurate and constructive feedback of the student's overall rotation pe rformance. Only one Student Evaluation Form from the rotation clerkship director (or designee) will be accepted. Students are not permitted to solicit additional evaluation forms from other clinical faculty on the rotation into the final evaluation form. Students who solicit additional evaluations may be brought before the APPS Committee. All submitted Student Evaluation Forms are final. Any factual or typographical errors should be reported to the Third- or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinic al Coordinator, as appropriate. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will review and approve any requested changes. The overall responsibility to ensure that evaluations have been completed and returned to the Office of Clinical Affairs (or site coordinator if indicated) remains with the student. For this reason, students are responsible for setting up a time to review their final 145 evaluation with their preceptor during the last week of the rotation to discuss their overall performance and obtain their preceptor signature on the evaluation. While the summative Student Rotation Evaluation must be completed and submitted at the end of the rotation, students are to regularly, including the end of the first and every week of each clinical rotation, request feedback from the preceptor, (e.g., \"How am I doing?\", \"Are there things I should improve?\") on a regular basis, in order to continually address areas that need improvement. This provides students an opportunity to improve any deficient areas while on the rotation, and prevents an unexpected poor evaluation at the end of the rotation. Students bear total responsibility to seek this ongoing feedback. Students should check with the Office of Clinical Affairs (or site coordinators if directed), regularly t o confirm they have received the Student Rotation Evaluation. Clinical Affairs staff may assist the student in obtaining an evaluation if a preceptor fails to complete the evaluation form or to turn it in to the Office of Clinical Affairs or site coordina tor in the required timeframe. Preceptor comments from the Student Rotation Evaluations will be included on the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). Delinquent Evaluations During the second week of the rotation, the CUSOM Third- or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator will enter the information provided by the Regional Site coordinators into CUSOM's web-based evaluation system. It is CUSOM's expectation the Clinical Faculty preceptor will complete the Student Rotation Eva luation at the end of the fourth week of the rotation and review it with the student to provide constructive criticism and feedback. Obtaining a Student Rotation Evaluation in a timely fashion is critical to ensure an up -to-date and accurate student academic record and transcript. At the end of the first week following a Clinical Rotation, the CUSOM Third - or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator run a report in CUSOM's web- based evaluation system to see identify any incomplete Studen t Rotation Evaluations. They report these findings to the corresponding student, Regional Site Coordinator (RSC), and Regional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate). The Regional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate) directly contacts the Clinical Faculty preceptor to remind him/her of the pending Rotation Evaluation. 146 At the end of the second week following a Clinical Rotation, the CUSOM Third - or Fourth- Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator run another report in CUSOM's web- based evaluation system to ide ntify any remaining incomplete Student Rotation Evaluations. These are communicated to the corresponding student, Regional Site Coordinator, Regional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate), and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, in collaboration with the Regional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate), directly contacts the Clinical Faculty preceptor to obtain the pending Rotation Evaluation. If the Clinical Rotation Evaluation is not completed by the third week following a Clinical Rotation, the Regional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate) or a designee completes the student's evaluation. Duri ng Ro tation WEEK 1 Regional Site Student Medical Education Coordinator (RSC) obtain updated Clinical Faculty preceptor contact information from students. WEEK 2 Regional Site Student Medical Education Coordinator (RSC) input information provided by Regional Site Student Medical Education Coordinators into CUSOM 's web -based evaluation system. WEEK 3 Regional Site Student Medical Education Coordinator (RSC) match student WEEK 4 (Week 2 if a two-week rot ation) Student Rotation Evaluation is completed at end of week and reviewed with student. 147 Post-Rotation Rotations, Course Remediation and Academic Probation Failure of a clinical rotation occurs if the student fails either the preceptor evaluation of the student or the end -of-rotation exam after his/her second attempt. Failure of a clinical rotation (grade of Fail Clinical, FC) for either reason will result in a referral to the APPS committee for review. If the student is permitted to r emediate, they will be required to repeat the entire rotation, including any associated modules and end- of-rotation exam, and may be placed on Academic Probation. Mandatory repeating of a clinical rotation will result in the institution of a Modified Cour se of Study, which may result in a delay of graduation. The student will incur additional tuition costs for the repeated rotation. Failure of a second clinical rotation is evidence that the student is unprepared for the rigors of clinical practice and ma y result in dismissal from the program. Students who fail a clinical rotation for any reason will come before the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. In addition, repeated performance evaluations in which items performed in a specific category or across categories are rated as \"1's\" or \"2's\", even if the student achieves a passing rotation grade, will be reason for remediation at the discretion of the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs in consultation with the Clinical Chair, the clinical faculty preceptor, or the APPS Committee. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will investigate any evaluation rating of \"2's\" or less on any competency regardless of an overall passing grade. The findings of this investigation may lead t o a follow - up meeting with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, Regional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate), or Clinical Chair, or result in referral to the APPS Committee. WEEK 2 CUSOM Co ordinators re-run web-based evaluati on system and sends to the student, R SC, RD/DSME and Associate Dean for Faculty preceptor di rectly. WEEK 3 If Student Rotation Evaluation not complete, RD/DSME or designee will complete student's evaluation WEEK 1 CUSOM Coordin ators run CUSOM's web -based evaluation system report of incomp lete Student Rotation Evaluations and sends to the student, RSC and Regional Dean (RD) or DSME . RD/DSME c ontacts Clinical Faculty preceptor directly 148 Students are expected show a progression of improvement in performance during the c ourse of clinical rotations. Students who fail to perform satisfactorily on clinical rotations as described above, will be referred to the APPS Committee and may result in additional required curriculum, repeat of an academic year, or dismissal from the p rogram. Poor ratings or preceptor comments on the clinical evaluation in the professional and ethical areas of the assessment of a student are addressed by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and may result in a remediation appropriate to correct the deficient area. The Associate Dean of Clinical Affairs may refer the student for an APPS Committee hearing which will act upon this referral depending on the severity and the area of the performance measure. Poor ratings related to professional and ethic al behavior area must be accompanied by comments as to the exact nature of the rating. Academic Probation MS-3 or MS -4 students may be placed on acad emic probation f or: Failing to successful ly remedi ate an end-of-rotation examination f ailure Failing a clinical rotation Failing a preceptor evaluation f or any rotation Failing two e nd-of-rotation examination s for any two rotations. 5.9.5 Grading Policies The detailed CUSOM grading policy and grading rubric for clinical rotations may be found in Section 6.2.2 of this Bulletin. Questionable Evaluations: All disputes regarding grades or ambiguous evaluations will be submitted to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for final resolution. Failur es: A failing grade on a clinical rotation, due to either failure of an end- of-rotation examination or a failing preceptor evaluation, will be recorded as a Fail Clinical (FC) or its equivalent on the stude nt's official transcript. A student failing a clinical rotation will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committe e, be required to repeat the clinical rotation, and may be placed into a Modi fied Course of Study which may result in delaying graduation. Additiona l consequences may apply to students who have failed a rotation as noted in Section 6.7 of this Bulletin . Further information regarding failure of clinical rotations and Modi fied Cour ses of Study may be found in Section s 6.2.3 and 6.6.3 of this Bulletin . Students who fail two or more rotations may be dismis sed from CUS OM. After satisfactory compl etion of the rotation, a Pass Clinical ( PC*) will be entered as the final grade for the rotation. 149 Incomplete Grades: If for any reason a student receives an incompl ete evaluation or is unable to compl ete a rotation or its associ ated requirements (including but not limited to rotation logs, pr eceptor evaluations or assigned cases), the student will receive an Incomplete (IC) for the rotation. Students are required to make up any incompl ete requirements as coordinated and approved by the Associate Dean for Clinic al Affairs. Failure to make up the requirements may constitute a failure to make acade mic progress and may be referred to the APPS committe e. In addition, failure to meet all third -year r otation requirements will result in an inabil ity for the student to be promoted to fourth- year clinical rotations. Nonatt endanc e Evaluat ions: Any student who does not report to a rotation (unless with prior consent of the Asso ciate Dean for Clinic al Affairs), will receive an autom atic Fail Clinical (FC) and will be referred to the APPS committe e. If a student is allowed to continue in the program, they may be placed on a Modifi ed Course of Study in order to make up the rotation at a later time as designated by the APPS Com mittee or Asso ciate Dean for Clinic al Affairs. Pla cement into a Modi fied Course of Study may result in a delay in the student's graduation date and may adversely affect financial aid and the student's ability to participate in the residency match process. Additiona l information regarding attendance policies, rotation failures, referral to the APPS Committee and Modifi ed Cour ses of Study can be found in Section s 5.7, 6.2.3, 6.7, and 6.6.3 of this Bulletin . Unauthoriz ed Rotations: Any student starting an Elective or Selective rotation without prior pr oper registration with the Office of Clinical Affairs will not receive credit for that rotation and all violations will be subject to review by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committe e. Students must obtain pre-approval for all Elective and Selective rotations to ensure all required documentation and proper affiliation agreements are in place. For questions regarding the approval process, students should contact the Student Medical Education Clinical Coordi nators f or Third Y ear or Fourth Year. 5.10 Hospital / Clinical Facility Information 5.10.1 Clinical Stud ent Prepa ration Campbell Univ ersity Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine third and fourth year medi cal students have all successfully compl eted two years of didactic education which prepares them for clinica l rotations. In addition to passing all require d course work, all stude nts beginning clinical rotations h ave compl eted the g: kground Check and S ubstance Abuse Scree n Students have had a background check prior to matriculating to CUSOM and again prior to clinical rotations. A subst ance abuse screen is compl eted before matriculation and again before the b eginning of the third year. Students may be required to submit to additiona l substance abuse testing again in the clinical years dependi ng on the clinica l site protocols, and any additional subst ance abuse screens will be at the student's expense. Immunizations Before registration, all students are required to provide a compl eted medical histo ry form and proof of immuniza Student Health Services. A compl eted physical examin ation form is required for students and is kept on file. Students are responsible for main taining immuniza tions required by the Campbe ll Univ ersity Jerry M. Wa llace School of Osteopathic Medicine in order to c ompl ete all required supe rvised clinica l practic e experiences. All stud ve provided proof of adequ ate immuni zation/immunity for the followin g: 1. Hepatitis B 2. Tetanus, diphther ia, pertussis 3. Measles, mumps, r ubella 4. Polio 5. Varicella 6. Influenza (annual vaccine) 7. TB skin test (twice given 2 weeks apart) -- If a student has had a positive TB test, a chest x-ray report has been r eceived as well as an annua l que stionna ire. Annual Influenza Vaccination R equirement For your own health and safety as well as that of the patients you serve, all students are required to obtain an annual influenza vaccination. The CDC cites yearly influenza vaccinations as the first step to helping protect yourself as well as others arou nd you from contracting the flu virus. F or more information from the CDC on flu vaccin ations, please visit ht tp://www. cdc.gov/ flu/about/s eason/upcoming.html Proof of annual influenza vacci ne is due to the Office of Clinical Affairs no later than November 15 of each year. 151 Certifications/Trainings All students beginning clinical rotations have successful ly completed the followi ng certifications /trainings prior to th eir clinical rot ation experiences: Basic Life Suppor t Advanced C ardiac Life HIPAA Training OSHA /Blood- borne Pathogen Training 5.10.2 Credentialin g of Medi cal Students at A ffiliated Sites CUSOM works with each affiliate d healthcare site to ensure proper crede ntialing of all medical students is completed prior to the start of the students sched uled clinical rotations. C redentialing ensure s CUSOM a ssists its affiliate d sites in pr ovidi ng the b est possible c linical rotation experiences for CUS OM medi cal students while assisting them in maintaining the highest quality care and safety for their patients and hospital s taff. All CUSOM affiliate d healthcare sites receive up-to-date and accurat e personal information for all CUSOM medi cal students participating in clinical rotations at their facilities. Th is crede ntialing inform ation ensure s all CUSOM medical students are granted proper access to the facility' s physician's portal, teachi ng faculty , clinical areas, dining facilities, medi cal library, phy sician's lounge , and employee parking (list may vary dependin g on site). CUSOM has designated affiliate d site liaisons who work with the site's Office of Staff Developm ent or Hum an Resources depa rtment, Public Safety department, and Infor mation Technolo gy department to obtain required credenti aling forms as well as create a streamlined process f or student crede ntialing.

In all cases, CUSOM is able to provide this paperwork upon t he affiliate d site's request. 152 5.10.3 Personal H ealth Insurance All Campbell Univ ersity Jerry M. Wa llace School of Osteopathic Medicine medi cal students are required to maintain health insur ance coverage . All students must either provide proof of health insur ance or purchase the health insur ance available throu gh the Univer sity. Proof of insuranc e is to be provided to the Office of Clinical Affairs on a yearl y basis, with ongoing updates for any change in coverage. Any medical costs incurred by students while in training, includi ng those as a result of needle sticks or exposure to infectious diseases or materials, are the responsibi lity of the student and his/he r health insu rance carrier. 5.10.4 Hospital T raining Program Structure Students will be assigned to a patient care team comprised of physicians and residents or int erns. This structure will provide all participants with clearly delineated responsibilities for m eeting in concer t with the CUSOM Offic e of Clinic al Affairs, will sp ecifically define the degre e of student invol vement in its own institution. Sta ndards for medi cal students should be consistent regar dless of their school of origin. CUSOM and each pa rticipating hospital will identi fy the personne l involve teaching p rogra ms, includi ng adminis trative personnel. Program coordination will be through the CUSOM Office of Clinic al Affairs and the Associate Dean for Clinic al Affairs. P rogram content, structure and evaluation will be the responsibili ty of the appropriate departments of the hospital and approved by CUSOM. Any diffic ulties in the program A ffairs. 5.10.6 Orientation At the start of clinical education, students will receive an orientation and compl ete all adminis trative requirements, includin g obtaining a badg er passwo rd, compl eting sary paperwork, EMR training, and additional site-specific HIPAA t raining, if needed. At the beginning of the clinical rotation, it is recomme nded that the precep tor and student meet to formulate mutu al goals in regar d to what they hope to achieve during the rotation. T he p recept or should communic ate his/her expectations of the student durin g the rotation. The se may include: Hours Interactions with o ffice and pr ofession al staff General attendance Call schedules 153 Overnight/weekend schedules Participation during rounds and conferences Expectations for clinical care, patient int eraction, and pr ocedures Oral presentations Written doc ument ation - EMR a nd ha ndwritten notes Assignments a nd write-ups Any additional duti es preceptor feels are necessa ry for learning purposes Students will comply with all requirements related to patient care as establish ed by the hospital/ training site. The student will be introduced to the clinical service by the Regional Dean/Director of Medical Education (DME) or Chief of that service, and will also be oriented to the physical plant. This m ay include, but is not limited to patient rooms, nursing stations, Emergency Departm ent, Ancillary Services facilities (radiolo gy, laboratory , etc.), rest rooms, lounge s, Cafeteria or Coffee Shop, a nd library . 5.10.7 Stude nt Requirements The specific objectiv es are defined for core rotations in the rotation sylla bi. The followi ng must be subm itted for a student to r eceive credit fo r the rotation: Student per formance evaluation ( a.k.a. Preceptor Evaluation of the Student ), Clinic al experience database (a.k.a. patient logs), and Site evaluation ( a.k.a. Student Ev aluation of Site and Preceptor). Additiona l requirements may be incorporated into specific rotations. The student will attend education al lectu res and seminars offere d at the hospital/tr aining site. Stude nts will be evaluated by each of the responsi ble individuals on the teaching service through periodic oral evaluation and obser vation of performance. P hysicians on the teaching service will complete a specific evaluation form provi ded by CUSOM for evaluation of student perform ance based on the AACOM core competencies. Students will also be evaluat ed on core rotations by comput er-based testing at the end of the rotation. 5.10.8 Informed Patient Cons ent Regarding Stude nt Involve ment in Patient Care Patients are essential partners in this education al endeavor . Efforts must be made to observe strict confidentiality, respect patient privacy and dignity, and honor their preferences regard ing treatme nt. P atients must be informed a student will participate in their care, and the patient's consent must be obtain ed. This may be done through standardized forms at admission/ check- in, or on a person-by-person basis. The students must be clearly identi fied as a student, wear their name badge, and verbally identify as such. If the patient requests a physician and refuses the student's services, this request must be hono red. Patients must know they will see their regular provider, and they should have an explicit oppor tunity to decline studen t involve ment. 154 5.10.9 Medical R ecords / Cha rting The responsibili ty given to students for medi cal records varies among facilities. Some sites allow students to write full progress notes and orders directly into the patient's chart. W hen this is allowe d, notes must be immedia tely co-signed by the supervising physician and the physician must follow with his or her own note. A t no time do student notes serve as the physician precepto r's notes. Billing must be directly related to t he services prov ided and document ed by the physician. Some hospital s/clinics have separat e page s in charts set aside for \"Student Progress Notes.\" These should also be review ed and co-signed by the attending physician. Poli cies may vary at different clinical si tes; students are require d to follow establish ed polic y at the training site. Not es are usually written in the SOAP format. If dictation or comput erized entry is allowed by students at a particular hospital or clinic, the resulting notes must also be reviewed and approved by the attending. The student is responsible for obtaini ng charting instructions from the preceptor or rotation coordi nator. The intro duction of electronic medi cal records (EMRs) presents obstacles for students if they lack a passwo rd or are not fully trained in the use of a particular institution's EMR system. In these cases, students are encourage d to hand write notes , which should be reviewed by preceptors wheneve r possible for feedbac k. Hand-written notes must be maintain ed accor ding to HIPPA principles and must be handled and or dispos ed of in a way that maintains strict patient confidentiality and conforms to the specific institution's p olicies. 5.10.10 Supe rvision of the Student During a student's time at the clinic or hospital, the preceptor must be available for supervision, consultation, and teachi ng or clearly designate an alternate precept or. Ha ving more than one clinical preceptor has both the potential to disru pt continui ty for the stude nt and the advantage of exposing them to valuable variations in pract ice style, which can help learners develop the profession al personality that best fits them. Students may also be given an assignment or be directed to spend time with ancillary staff (x- ray, lab, physical therapy , etc.), as these experiences can also be very valuabl e. The preceptor should be awar e of the student's assigned activitie s at all times. Students are not employee s of the hospitals or clinics and, therefore, work entirely unde r the p recept or's supervision. O n each rotation, it is the student's responsibi lity to ensure the sup ervising physician or preceptor also sees all of the student's patients. The preceptor can provide direct supervision of technical skills with gradually increas ed autonom y in accor danc e with the student's demonstrated level of expertise. 155 5.11 Graduate Medical Education CUSOM strives to develop a sufficient number of residency training positions as required by our accreditation body. The Associate Dean for Postgraduate Affairs is responsible for facilitating residency program development and assisting with the strategies for placement of CUSOM graduates into graduate medical education programs. Regional Deans, who supervise third- and fourth- year student rotations at their site, also assist in th e development and maintenance of residency training programs. CUSOM's goal is to develop the same or greater number of GME positions as our number of graduates. The Campbell University GME programs provide graduating students postgraduate training opport unities and help meet the need for future physicians to care for the rural and underserved populations in North Carolina, the Southeastern United States, and the nation. 156 6. Academic Policies and Procedures 6.1 Advising and Tutoring 6.1.1 Advising and Faculty Access CUSOM believes strong academic counseling should provide students with excellent longitudinal guidance and support starting during the pre - matriculation phase and continuing through graduation. CUSOM's comprehensive academic counseling process includes a series of academic transition support activities, long -term, consistent mentorship from academic advisors, licensing exam and residency preparation support, the training and allocation of peer -tutors, learning enrichment programs, and targeted individual and group workshops through its Academic Center of Excellence (CUSOM ACE). Additionally, CUSOM's Clinical Faculty Chairs serve a critical role in advising students as they advance towards graduate medical education and the residency selection process. Organizational Structure of the Academic Center of Excellence ( ACE ) CUSOM ACE, under the directorship of the two Assistant Deans for Academic Success and the support of an Executive Assistant, is responsible for the overall success of CUSOM students. CUSOM ACE manages academic support programs and learning services including, but not limited to peer -tutor program, study skill developme nt workshops, behavioral counseling, individual academic coaching, faculty advising support, and an on-line student forum. CUSOM ACE also hosts a collection of learning and licensing exam preparation resources accessible to the CUSOM community through its computers or mini library. The CUSOM ACE Blackboard community and Facebook group pages provide additional platforms for disseminating information as well as promoting collaborative academic interactions. Academic Transition Activities CUSOM ACE is resp onsible for designing and leading activities and programs designed to assist matriculating students develop study skills and techniques, which will assist them in achieving academic success. Two weeks prior to Orientation of the new incoming class, ACE di stributes a pre-matriculation reading assignment on the topic of \"The Science and Strategies for Successful Learning and Study.\" This material, prepared by CUSOM ACE, is a collection of highlights and excerpts from the literature pertaining to critical sk ills essential for academic success in a high -volume, high-paced learning environment. This material provides students with foundational knowledge in areas such as growth mindset, metacognition, spaced practice, interleaving, etc., which is expanded upon during Orientation. During Block 1, two study skill workshops further expand on 157 these topics , discuss test-taking skill s, and how to utilize an exam debrief for refining study skills. Additional academic skill workshops are also offered at the beginning of Block 2 and Block 5 with emphases on transitioning to specific phases of the curriculum. Long- term, Consistent Mentorship from Academic Advisors The academic Advisor -Advisee relat ionship is one of an institutional representative providing insight or direction to a student about academic, professional, scholarly, and career planning issues. The nature of this direction may be to inform, suggest, counsel, discipline, coach, mentor, or even teach. The CUSOM advising process ensures both biomedical science and clinical faculty are involved in student advising and establishing relationships which create an atmosphere of trust and meaningful dialogue. The Advisor/Advisee relationship w ill ensure consistent feedback regarding academic performance and direct the student to additional resources within the institution as needed. All advisors play an important role in identifying students experiencing academic, personal or behavioral health problems and providing them with referrals to CUSOM ACE for individual study skill coaching or to Behavioral Health Services for assessment and appropriate treatment. The Executive Director of Student Affairs and the Assistant Dean s for Academic Success assign academic advisors, with input and approval by the Dean, to each incoming CUSOM student. Such mentorship is typically carried out through both mandatory group and individual meetings. In the first two years, this is facilitated through designated time on the academic calendar fo r the advisors to meet with their advisees. The frequency of meetings between students and their advisors duri ng years 1 and 2 is as follows: During Blocks 1 and 2, students meet with their academic advisors at least once individually each Block, and once in a group setting each Block (4 meetings total). The purpose of these meetings is to provide the academic support to the students during thi s transitional period. During Blocks 3 -5, students are required to meet with their advisors at least once each Block in a group setting. Additional individual meetings can be arranged based on needs. In addition to their role as specifically assigned academic advisors, faculty also meet with non -assigned students to provide additional help with course work. Faculty offer office hours individually and are available to students for any additional assistance. Scheduling may be done either directly with faculty, or through the appropriate administrative assistant. By matriculating at CUSOM, students agree that their grades will be shared with their faculty advisors in an effort to facilitate effective advising. 158 Licensing Exam and Residency Preparation Support To help guide CUSOM students in preparation and planning for national licensing exams through the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME) and the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME), the CUSOM Vice Dean for Academic Affairs , and the Executive Director of Assessment, Accreditation, and Medical Education provide presentations to MS -1 and MS -2 students, and also offer individualized advisement. These sessions and meetings offer insights, data, and gui dance for studying and scheduling COMLEX -USA Level 1 exams. As students enter third year, additional advising relationships are developed to support clinical rotation needs and residency specialty selection and application processes. Students are provide d a list of clinical advisors/mentors classified by their areas of clinical expertise and may choose additional mentors according to their interest in a specific clinical discipline. Clinical advisors provide guidance to the students with a focus on the c linical path they are interested in pursuing. CUSOM Clinical Department Chairs provide guidance regarding clinical rotations, addressing any issues with rotation performance and meeting curricular requirements. The Clinical Department Chairs also provide support to students applying to residency programs in their specific or related fields by meeting with students to offer residency planning advice and providing letters of recommendations for s tudent residency applications. Rising fourth- year students pa rticipate in CUSOM's annual Residency Fair which is designed to help students narrow down their specialty selection and prepare for the process of applying to residency programs. The event includes a presentation on criteria to consider when selecting a s pecialty and a panel discussion including residency program directors, current residents from Campbell co -sponsored postgraduate training programs, and fourth- year students in the application process. Participating students have the opportunity to attend breakout sessions for two different specialties, presented by that discipline's Chair, where they are provided valuable information regarding the specialty (training, job opportunities/outlook, lifestyle etc.), evaluating their competitiveness for applying to that specialty, and key information and advice for that specialty's residency application process. Students also have the chance to talk directly with Program Directors and staff from residency programs. In the first month of their fourth year, medic al students complete the Residency Development course. This course includes a lecture series and a 4-station qualifying OSCE specifically targeted to prepare the students for the COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE Exam. In addition, there are a series of lectures des igned to prepare students for their transition into residency with topics including Deciding on a Specialty and Advising Offered Through CUSOM, Applying for Residency Programs, Interviewing for Residency 159 Programs, The Match and What Happens if I Don't, and What I Need to be Able to Do on Day One of Residency? Additional information and resources are also provided including Match results, resources available through the AAMC, templates and Curriculum Vitae writing support. Fourth- year students also particip ate in mock residency interviews during which they receive immediate feedback on their performance and specific advising regarding targeted areas for improvement in their interviewing skills. Enrichment and Intervention Support from the Academic Center of Excellence (ACE) Through collaboration with the Department of Behavioral Health, CUSOM ACE assists students, directly and indirectly, to achieve academic excellence. The two Assistant Deans for Academic Success lead CUSOM ACE and provide counseling services for study skills, time management, test-taking skills, etc. directly to students in group settings or during one - on-one meetings. Individual meetings are scheduled based on need or according to the recommendation of Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee or the Dean's office. Students who receive a grade of 75% or less on any integrated exam are recommended to contact their academic advisor or CUSOM ACE for an individual meeting. Meeting frequency is tailored to individual student needs based on academic performance, student requests, or recommendations of the ACE, faculty advisors, or the APPS Committee. Students who desire individual advising sessions can schedule additional meetings with their academic advisor or ACE at any time regardless of their academic performance. These meetings can be one -time only, weekly, or bi -weekly, whichever the students and CUSOM ACE directors deem appropriate. Recommendation to seek additional support from Behavioral Health when necess ary is also an integral part of this process. To maximize the effectiveness of faculty academic advisor s, CUSOM ACE also organizes o r participates in faculty development sessions to facilitate discussion, share best practices, and offer useful tools for m entoring students. Beyond fostering MS -1 and MS -2 students' academic success within the CUSOM curriculum, CUSOM ACE also provides guidance and helpful resources for their licensing exam preparation. Computers available through CUSOM ACE provide students protected, full access to many common Board study programs and question banks. CUSOM ACE also has a private Facebook page, utilizing social media to deliver up- to-date information or daily practice questions t o the CUSOM student community. 160 6.1.2 CUSOM Peer- Tutor Program CUSOM ACE develops and manages additional academic support services through the CUSOM Peer -Tutor. The CUSOM Peer -Tutor program is designed to assist students requesting tutoring service to become more proficient in subject -specific materials and more efficient and effective independent learners across a broad range of courses. Peer tutoring is intended to enhance, not replace lecture attendance and personal study time. Tutors also act as facilitators for student learning, assisting w ith clarification of lecture and lab objectives, discussions, readings, or other assignments. CUSOM ACE identifies, trains, and appoints course -specific tutors. To become a certified tutor, students must meet the minimal academic requirements (ranking th e top 25% of a specific course and maintaining a cumulative GPA 3.3), complete a Tutor Training Workshop provided by the ACE, and be approved by the Course Director(s). CUSOM MS -1 and MS -2 students who wish to receive peer - tutoring support place their requests by logging onto the Blackboard Class Community and complet ing a request form provided via a Wufoo link. The Academic Center for Excellence (ACE) will identify available certified peer - tutors who will then contact the tutees directly to arrange session(s) on a short - or long -term basis. The goal of tutoring sessions is to clarify and review concepts, explain processes, and assist in problem solving. The interactions between tutor and tutee are required to adhere to the rules of academic profess ionalism, confidentiality, and honesty according to the CUSOM Honor Code. The most updated CUSOM Peer -Tutor Program manual is published on the ACE Blackboard Community page. As a student -centered institution, all CUSOM administrators are accessible to students when needed and based on availability. Administrative leadership also strives to conduct informal meetings with students on a regular basis, such as \"Breakfast/Lunch with the Dean\", a twice- monthly meeting of student small groups with the Dean and Associate Deans. In summary, academic advisors, CUSOM Behavioral Health, the Academic Center for Excellence, faculty, Deans, and staff are available to discuss personal and academic problems that may arise throughout the four years of medical school, and provide guidance and/or referrals to other resources as necessary. 6.1.3 Academic Freedom Policy Faculty are entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results, subject to the adequate performance of his/her other academic duties; but research for pecuniary return must be based upon an understanding with the authorities of the institution in advance of the acceptance of employment. Faculty are entitled to freedom in the classroom in di scussing his/her subject, but he/she should be careful not to introduce into his /her teaching controversial matter which has no relation to the subject. Limitations of academic freedom because of religious or other aims of the institution should be clearly stated in writing at the time of the appointment. 161 The University faculty member is a citizen, a member of a learned profession, and an officer of an educational institution. His/her primary loyalty is to his/her institution, his/her profession, and his/her growth and development as a scholar, a per son, and a teacher. He/She possesses the right, as a citizen, to speak and write, subject to special obligations arising from his/her position as an employee of the University; to be accurate, to exercise proper restraint, to show respect for the opinions of others, and to make ever y effort to indicate that in his/her role as a citizen he/she is not an institutional spokesman. Moreover, he/she should allow for the fact that many members of the general public will find it difficult to disassociate his/her utterances as a citizen from his/her institutional identification. He/ She should not use official university stationery, logos, watermarks or his/her institutional title in issuing public statements which he/she makes purely in his/her role as a citizen. Students and faculty may not represent themselves verbally, in print, or electronically (including use of Campbell University or CUSOM logos, titles, letterhead, or stationery) as representing Campbell University or CUSOM without the express written permission of the Dean. Failure to comply may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. 6.2 Assessment 6.2.1 Global Assessment Throughout the CUSOM curriculum, examinations and other assessments are administered to assess student knowledge and performance. Students are assessed to gauge satisfactory individual academic progress on the basis of performance on written and practical examinations, Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs), in the clinical setting, and performance on national osteopathic licensing examinations. The Executive Director of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education, the Office of Clinical A ffairs, the Office of Academic Affairs (including the Registrar), as well as the Office of the Dean, work collaboratively with the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards Committee (APPS) Committee to determine each individual student's eligibility for promotion or graduation, consider the results of the student assessments and reports concerning attendance, and monitor conduct and potential professionalism issues. Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress are addressed through the pr ocesses described in this Academic Bulletin. For example, under certain circumstances, students may be brought before the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee for disciplinary action or academic review, with recommendations made to the Dean for final adjudication. 162 Assessment Outcome objectives have been mapped to the courses in which they are covered, and evaluation strategies are utilized to ensure that all CUSOM graduates achieve the intended learning outcomes. The CUSOM Comprehensive Assessment Plan summarizes additional m ethods and metrics which are tracked for continual program evaluation and improvement. Assessment of knowledge is conducted by multiple -choice examinations and quizzes administered at scheduled intervals. Laboratory, including anatomy, OMM, clinical skills, simulation and OSCE assessments are in written or verbal exam format. Assessment of performance on clinical rotations is by end -of-rotation examinations, preceptor evaluations and related methods. Assessment of performance compared to national cohort s occurs through the end -of-rotation COMAT exam and the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examinations (COMLEX -USA Levels 1, 2 -CE, 2 -PE and 3). 6.2.2 Credits, Grading, and Grade Point Average (GPA) Credit Assignment Process The Office of Academic Affairs is charged with ensuring the appropriateness of credit assignments within the CUSOM curriculum. Corresponding credits are assigned to all courses in the curriculum, including clinical rotations, based on contact hours. Credit assignments are reviewed as described below, and the credit assignments are consistent with the definition of a credit hour as provided in the glossary of the Accreditation of Colleges of Osteopathic subcommittee of the CUSOM Dean's Council ), the CUSOM Curriculum Committee, and the Campbell University Curriculum Council (UCC) have reviewed the credit assignment process and CUSOM curriculum as part of the institutional accreditation process. Campbell University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award associate, baccalaureate, masters, and doctorate degrees. Contact the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033- 4097 or call ( 404) 679-4500 for questions about the accreditation of Campbell University. 163 Campbell University was awarded Level VI accreditation by the SACSCOC on May 29, 2013, at which time SACSCOC approved t he Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree program of CUSOM. The SACSCOC approval reads: \"The Boar d of Trustees of the Southern Asso ciation of Colleg es and Schools C ommission on Colleg es revie wed the materials seeking approval of the Do ctor of Osteopathic Med icine degree program. It was the decision of the Boa rd to appr ove the program and include it in the s cope of the curren t accreditation and to advance the institution to L evel VI.\" Campbell University is one of only four private universities in North Carolina to be awarded Level VI accreditation status by SACSCOC. CUSOM's integrated curricular approach utilizes biomedical science and clinical faculty to explain concepts and prepare students in a logical sequence to become more clinically adept a s they progress towards clinical rotations. The third and fourth year clinical rotations provide opportunities for in- depth clinical exposure in a variety of core and elective rotations. CUSOM C redit Cal culation The CUSOM curriculum utilizes a process by which course grades are determined per Block of study with a designated number of weeks per Block. For the first two years of the curriculum, there are eight Blocks of study ranging from nine (9) weeks to eleven (11) weeks duration. For the third and fourth years, clinical rotations represent four -week (4) Blocks of time. Some clinical rotations may be divided into shorter time intervals, such as two (2) weeks, as approved by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. CUSOM assigns grades to all credit -bearing courses, and credits for each course are determined based on contact hours utilizing 0.5 credit increments. A minimum number of contact hours per credit is delineated, and a course with contact hours not reaching the requirement for the next higher credit value is reported at the next lower credit value. For example, a 1.0 credit course requires 16 contact hours so a course of 10 contact hours would be assigned a value of 0.5 credit, not 1.0 credit. This credit hour calculation is consistent with US Department of Education standards. Credit Re view Pr ocess CUSOM assigns the amount of credit awarded for student work, and the criteria utilized in this process conform to commonly accepted practices of higher education. CUSOM awards credits to course offerings based on delivery method and duration, utilizing standards endorsed by the American Association of Collegiate Registrar's and Admission Officers (AACRAO), as well as the minimum Federal Financial Aid regulations. 164 Review of the curriculum, including credits, is through the CUSOM Curriculum Committee, as well as the Campbell University Curriculum Council (UCC), as necessary. To ensure appropriateness and consistency, CUSOM reviews credit assignments for the curriculum periodically as part of the curricular design review process. The process includes, but is not limited to, review of current standards of higher education, precedent established by other Colleges/Schools of Osteopathic Medicine, and consistency with the CUSOM Mission . The records of review of the credit assignment as part of the overall curriculum review are maintained in the Office of Academic Affairs. All proposed curricular changes, including minor a nd substantive changes, are brought to the Initial Review Committee (IRC), a subset of the Dean's Council , and also the full Curriculum Committee for review, consideration, discussion and approval. Minor changes include such matters as the addition/elimin ation of a course, modifications to an existing course, or minor changes to existing program requirements. Substantive changes are those that involve extensive new patterns of requirements for existing students, or those that have a significant impact on other programs within the University. For proposed non -substantive curricular changes in years 1 and 2, with minimal impact on other programs or on student requirements, approval is required first through the Block Leaders and Course Directors, in consultation with the Assistant Dean for Curriculum, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration, or the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs as necessary, the IRC, and finally by the Curriculum Committee. For proposed non -substantive curricular changes in years 3 and 4, with minimal impact on other programs or on student requirements, approval is required first through the Clinical Department Chairs, in consultation with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration, or the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs as necessary, the IRC, and finally by the Curriculum Committee. Upon approval at all levels, the proposed changes are then presented to the Dean for review and final approval. Any proposed substantive changes, as defined by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA), would follow procedures and deadlines as outlined in the COCA Accreditation of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Accreditation Standards and Procedures document: 165 The COCA must be notified of all substantive change requests, which the COM wishes to ha ve reviewed at the n ext regularly scheduled me eting. The COM must notify the COCA of its substantive change request at least six ty (60) days prior to the next regularly scheduled me eting. The COM must submit to the COCA all material that supports their substantive change request at least thirty (30) da ys prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting. Documentation required for the substantive change submis sion would be submi tted as required. COCA Substantive Change Policies and Procedures are found at: https://osteopathic.org/wp -content/uploads/2018/02/coca - substantive -change -processes.pdf The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) is the regional body for the accreditation of degree - granting higher education insti tutions in the Southern states. As such, any proposed CUSOM substantive changes also would be reported to SACSCOC per their requirements and in a timely manner. Grading CUSOM has developed and publicized a grading system, in keeping with the CUSOM Mission , to assess the progress of each student toward acquiring the competencies essential to effecti ve performance as an osteopathic physician . Throughout all four years of the CUSOM curriculum, students must complete all required coursework and clinical rotations with passing grades as published in this Academic Bulletin. Students who fail any part of the curriculum will be referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for review. Additionally, CUSOM maintains longitudinal records marking the career tracks, choices, and achievements of graduates in a comprehensive assessment system. This assessment includes: COMLEX -USA Level rates; licensure; geographic area of practice; obtainment and completion of a postgraduate training program; and AOA or ABMS board certification. CUSOM publishes outcomes of student performance in annual reports to the faculty and Board of Trustees. 166 CUSOM has adopted the following schema for determining letter grades and clinical grades: Grading Scale MS-1 and and MS-4 Rotations Preceptor - Exam Grades Overall Final Grade Quality Points Other Grades A 90-100a 4.0 H-H Honor s 4.0 IC Incomplete B 80-89 3.0 H-HP Honor s 4.0 W Withdraw C 70-79 2.0 HP-HP High Pass 3.5 C*b 70 2.0 H-P High Pass 3.5 F < 70 0.0 HP-P High Pass 3.5 P 70 4.0 P-P Pass Clinical 3.0 P*b 70 2.0 PC*b Pass Clinical 2.0 FC Fail Clinical 0.0 FMP and PCC are P/F P = 4.0 QP F = 0.0 QP P* = 2.0 QP PC = Pass Clinical FC = Fail Clinical a The maximum percentage cannot ex ceed 100. Pe rcentage grades are rounded to t he tenth from 0.50 upwards, th erefore 82.50 -82.99 = 83, while 82.49 = 82. b Denotes course was passed after successful r emediation of an initial failing grade. Incomplete (IC) and Withdrew (W) do not carry any quality points. Grade Point Average (GPA) , Quality Points A student's grade point average (GPA) is determined by dividing the total number of quality points earned by the total number of graded hours attempted. Note that for purposes of GPA calculations, a grade of \"W\" is not included in \"graded hours attempted\". If a student has earned 227 quality points on 61 graded hours attempted, the grade point average would be 227/61 = 3.721. In the first two years of the CUSOM curriculum, most courses use a traditional letter grade system (A, B, C or F) and are calculated into the GPA. In the third and fourth years of the CUSOM curriculum, all rotations have a clinical rotation grade as determined through the student's rotation evaluation, and all core rotations have clinical modules and end- of-rotation exam grades. Both the clinical rotation grade and the module portions of the rotation grade use an Honors, High Pass, Pass Clinica l, Fail Clinica l system. Successful completion of the rotation requires students to pass both the clinical rotation (preceptor evaluation) and the end- of-rotation exa m or module portions of the course. Students failing a n end-of-rotation exam have a second opportunity to pass the exam within thirty ( 30) days of notification. 167 If the student fails the second attempt at the post -rotation exam, an F is recorded on the module/exam grade. Students who fail a clinical rotation either due to failure of the post -rotation exam or the preceptor evaluation will be reviewed and acted upon by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. If the APPS Committee grants the student the opportunity to remediate the failed rotation, the entire rotation and post -rotation exam must be repeated in or der to successfully remediate the rotation. No course or clinical rotation grade will be changed unless the Office of Academic Affairs or the Office of Clinical Affairs certifies to the Registrar, in writing, an error occurred or remediation results in a grade change. A student may appeal to the Dean for consideration of a grade change only after the APPS Committee has convened and rendered their recommendation. NOTE: \"F\" grades. A student who earned a grade of F initially and is eligible to remediate the course will have the grade reported as Incomplete (IC) on his/her transcript until the prescribed remediation is attempted and a new grade is issued. The Registrar will report current IC grades to the appropriate Associate Dean at the time the IC is as signed. Once an IC grade has been officially changed to a letter grade on the transcript, the Registrar will not retain a record of IC courses as part of the academic record. Students who fail to successfully remediate a grade of F will have failed the course and receive an F on the transcript. The highest grade that can be earned for a remediated course is 70%. The new grade, if remediated successfully, will have the letter grade C or P with an asterisk (C* or P*, respectively) associated with the cour se to reflect a repeated course on the transcript. The grade of C* represents a remediated, passed Graded course, and a P* represents a remediated, passed Pass -Fail course. A successfully remediated clinical rotation will be represented on the transcript as PC*, with the asterisk denoting a remediated clinical rotation. Students with a GPA in the top quartile of the class may be recognized on the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). Quality Points Quality points are points assigned to grades in an academic \"banking\" system. CUSOM is on a four -point system. In this system, an \"A\" is worth four (4.0) points per hour, a \"P\" is worth four (4.0) points per hour, a \"B\" is worth three (3.0) points per hour, a \"C\" is worth two (2.0) points per hour, a \"C*\" or \"P*\" is worth two (2.0) points per hour, and zero (0) points awarded for \"F\" or failing grades. A student who earns an \"A\" in a three -168 hour course has 4.0 points per hour x 3 hours = 12 total quality points. Incomplete (IC), Withdraw (W), and T hird- and Fourth- Year Clinical Rotation grades do not carry any quality points. 6.2.3 Remediation Throughout all four years of the CUSOM curriculum, students must complete all required coursework and clinical rotations with passing grades as published in this Academic Bulletin. Students who fail any part of the curriculum are brought before the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for review and possible disciplinary action. The APPS Committee may offer students who fail any pa rt of the curriculum an opportunity for remediation. A student in the first (MS -1) or second (MS -2) year of studies, who fails any course, will appear before the APPS Committee. If the Committee grants the student the opportunity to remediate, the student will receive a grade of Incomplete (IC) until remediation is complete. The student will receive a grade of C* for a graded course or P* for a Pass/Fail course after the successful remediation of the failed course. The C* or P* will remain on the transc ript with the notation that the student passed after remediation. A student will earn a grade of F if not allowed remediation or if the student fails the remediation. A student in the third (MS -3) or fourth (MS -4) year of studies who fails a clinical rotation will appear before the APPS Committee. If the Committee grants the student the opportunity to remediate the rotation, the student will receive a grade of Incomplete (IC) until remediation is complete. The student will receive a PC* after the succes sful remediation of the failed rotation, and the PC* will appear on the transcript with the notation that the student passed the rotation after remediation. A student will earn a grade of FC if not allowed remediation or if the student fails the remediation. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO REMEDIATE IS NOT GUARANTEED AND IS A DECISION MADE BY THE APPS COMMITTEE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. A STUDENT MUST NOT ASSUME HE/SHE WILL BE GRANTED REMEDIATION. 6.2.4 Grading for Years One and Two Eval uation Categories For the purposes of this Grading Policy, CUSOM recognizes four categories of evaluation modalities, including, but not limited to: 1. Integrated written e xaminations 2. Laboratory practical examinations 3. Quizzes 4. Other (e.g., SIM performance, E arly Clinical Experiences, Projects) 169 Each category is represented within the CUSOM curriculum. A course grade can be determined by any combination of the components listed above as determined by the Course Director and approved by the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs or Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Integration. Process In an effort to promote faculty flexibility in assigning grades through assessment venues for the four categories identified above , yet also provide consistency across courses, CUSOM recognizes the following approach to testing and grading: Integrated exams typically occur three times in each Block in Years 1 & 2. FMP, PCC, OMM and Clinical Skills course questions are not inclu ded on the integrated exams except where they are consistent with discip line content in other courses. All other courses may have questions on integrated exams. OMM and Clinical Skills have separate didactic exams, as well as their Pr actical and Lab exams, as required. Quizzes are typically administered each Friday morning of the MS- 1 and MS-2 curriculum. These are integrated and include questions from lect ures given in the truction days . Quizzes may be administered at other times as determined by respective faculty. Course grades are typically determined based on percentag e of total point s earn ed out of tot al points poss ible. Grades are defined by the course-grading plan approved prior to start of the course and delineated in the course syllabi . As su ch, bonus point s are not pe rmitted. In rare instances, there may be except ions to the establish ed Grading Policy, whi ch require jus tification for deviation from the original plan; however, every attempt is made to ensure the policy stated to the stude nts at the start of the course is the policy by which they will receive th eir course grades. 6.3 Educational Records 6.3.1 Policy Statement on Student Information and Educational Recor ds It is the policy of CUSOM to release certain directory information of CUSOM students in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA; 42 USCA 1232g, as amended). Under the provisions of this law, students in post -secondary education have the right to inspect and review their school records, as defined by law. Other than for \"Di rectory Information,\" see: www.campbell.e du/registrar/family-educat ion-rights-and-privacy-act-ferpa/ 170 Campbell University release information only with the student's written consent and/ or in compliance with federal law and regulation. The CUSOM Registrar's Office will maintain a locked fireproof cabinet in a secure, locked room for the safekeeping of all CUSOM student academic records. In addition, CUSOM has a secure, confidential, and onsite computerized record system with offsite sec ure network backup. All items entered into this system are retained as a part of the student's permanent record. The student's permanent record contains his/her transcript from CUSOM, transcripts and transcript evaluations from other educational agencies attended by the student, secondary school transcripts, Standardized test scores, the student's application for admission, general correspondence with the student, and if applicable, letters concerning misconduct. Upon appointment with the Registrar, a st udent may examine their transcript and contents of their permanent record. University officials with access to the student's educational records are the President, Provost, Academic Deans, Registrar, Executive Director of Student Affairs , and designees of these University officials with a legitimate educational interest in the reco rd. Campbell University guarantees each student certain rights in compliance with FERPA. Please refer to the A nnual Notification health and safety emergency exception which states that the institution may disclose personally identifiable information from an education record to appropriate parties including parents in connection with an emergency if knowledge of the inform ation is necessary to protect the health and safety of the student or other individuals. More information can be found at: https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/student s.html All documents and other information concerning student academic records, student discipline, including written reprimands, are securely maintained in a confidential file. Such actions become a part of the student's permanent education record. All disciplinary actions, with the exception of admonitions and academic warnings are required to be reported on the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) as well as any State Medical Education Verification forms. Once a student participates in the M atch and is placed, several forms must be completed and processed for licensing purposes in the state the student will be doing their residency. State Medical Education Verification forms vary from 171 state to state. Most verifications have very specific in formation requested and CUSOM must provide a complete and thorough answer. CUSOM will be requested to complete and file another medical school education verification form throughout the alumni's lifetime with any program or residence move. 6.4 Attendance 6.4.1 Attendance Policy Attendance of first - and second- year students is expected at all lectures, and required at all labs and other scheduled curricular activities. Attendance will be monitored by the Office of Assessment, Accreditation and Medical Education (Med Ed) using the lecture hall cameras, and electronic attendance records are maintained. Absences for emergencies are considered on a case- by-case basis through Med Ed. Any falsification of attendance records is viewed as an Honor Code violat ion. Failure to maintain adequate attendance during the first two years of the curriculum may result in corrective action through the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. Attendance of third and fourth year students is required for all requisite clinical duties of the particular rotation on a daily basis with any structured time away from the rotation approved through the process described in the corresponding section below. Students on clinical rotations are expected to be on time for all assigned activities associated with that particular rotation. Activities may include, but are not limited to, lectures, rounds, hospital committee meetings, on-call assignments, case presen tations, etc . Students must abide by attendance requirements as described in Section 5.7 of this Bulletin . Violations of the attendance requirement policy may result in disciplinary action by the APPS Committee including, but not limited to, removal from any leadership position with a student club, organization or student government office, and possible notation of policy violations or professionalism issues in the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissal from the program. 6.4.2 MS-1 and MS-2 Years It is recognized there may be isolated instances when an individual must be absent; however, a student who misses a lecture, laboratory or workshop is not excused from the subject materials or duties of that particular session(s) . The student may be required to make -up the missed educational session(s) during off-hours. Make -up laboratories are conducted only in extreme situations and at the discretion of the Course Direct or in consultation with the Block Leaders, Med Ed , and Vice Dean for Academic Affairs when necessary. 172 The total number of absences must not exceed 20% of a course. No excused absences are granted while the 20% threshold has not been reached. However, students who qualify for an excused absence will receive a one -day, 4 lecture hour allowance, per Block, not per course, to be used during the time -period noted in the excused absence request. This excused time allowance will be tracked but will not count towards their 20% threshold. A student may be eligible to request an excused absence through Med Ed by meeting one of the following qualifying criteria: For a medical co ndition/illness, the student must provide Med Ed with a note fr om the examining physician (who is NOT a f amily member) indicating the medical visit, the amount of recommended time -off, a nd the student's re turn-to-class da te. For personal leave, unless it is emergent in nature, the absence request must be submitte d at least seven (7) days prior to the anticipated absence. Personal leave does not include vacations, weddings, graduations or other similar activities or events. Examples include: o Death in imme diate family stepparent , grandparen t, spouse, spous e's parent, child or siblin g. For Jury Duty, the absence request and supporting documentation must be submitted at least seven (7) days prior to the anticipated absence. For attending CUSOM -related activities or national meetings of student clubs and organizations, an excused absence request must be submitted, in writing, to Med Ed at least seven (7) days prior to the anti cipated absence(s). To be considered for such request, students must have a cumulative GPA 3.0 on a 4.0 scale, no prior course failures, and be in good academic standing. Students are allowed a maximum of two (2) excused absences per semester for voluntary attendance at conferences if all other excused absence criteria has been met. No travel arrangements should be made prior to approval being granted by Med Ed. CUSOM accepts no responsibility or liability for any losses as a consequence of any cancel led or delayed travel plans. Approved absences for students required to attend national conferences will not be subject the 20% rule; however, formal requests must be submitted for approval. Students may request an excused absence for religious holidays not included in the list of recognized University holidays. Appropriate documentation to support the request is required, and must be submitted for approval to Med Ed. 173 As there is no 20% allowance for mandatory laboratory (OMM, Anatomy) Clinical Skills activity, or Interprofessional Education (IPE) activity , a separate laboratory excused absence request must be completed and submitted to the Course Director and Med Ed. The same aforementioned criteria outlined above apply. Med Ed will notify the Cours e Director of the decision if approved. Approval must be granted and obtained in order to arrange a make -up with the Course Director. An unexcused absence from one of these activities may result in a grade of zero (0) or an overall grade deduction (refer to each specific course syllabus). In the event of any absence from an examination or quiz, approval must be obtained from Med Ed to arrange a make -up (approvals based upon the qualifying criteria detailed above). It is essential each student make every effort not to miss any examination or quiz. Requests for make -up examinations or quizzes must be made in a timely manner with Med Ed. An unexcused absence from an examination or quiz may result in a grade of zero (0) for that assessment. For an absence to be considered excused, students must notify Med Ed and complete the appropriate lecture or lab \"Excused Absence Request Form\" online. Med Ed will determine if the excused absence is approved or denied, and the student will be notified of the decision in a timely manner. If a student is failing any course or has been placed on Academic Probation, he/she may not be approved for an excused absence unless for an extenuating situation determined o n a case- by-case basis. The Vice Dean for Academic Affairs will resolve any disagreement concerning an attendance decision. Once an absence request is approved, it is the student's responsibility to contact the Course Directors and Med Ed to arrange a makeup for missed laboratories or an examination/quiz where a pplicable. It is important to note that, although the Course Directors will do their best to accommodate the makeup requests, some missed experiences may not be replicable, and the arrangement is at the Course Directors' discretion. In the case in which a missed experience is not replicable, and therefore unable to be made up, the student may receive a zero (0) for that assessment, which may lead to an overall failing course grade. Official Ho lidays CUSOM o bserves the f ollowing Univ ersity holidays. New Year 's Day Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Good Friday Memorial Day Independence Day Labor D ay Thanksgiving (2 Days) Christmas ( Varies) Holidays falling on a weekend will be observed either on the Friday before or the Monday after the holiday, or as designated by Campbell University. 174 Jury Duty It is the duty of every citizen to serve on jury duty when called. If a CUSOM student is called to serve on a jury, or if a CUSOM student is ordered to appear in court as a witness, the student should submit the appropriate lecture and/or lab excused absence request as outlined above, and advise the Asso ciate Dean for Biomedical Affairs as soon as possible. As noted above, in the cases of Jury Duty, the absence request and supporting documentation must be submitted to Med Ed at least seven (7) days prior to the anticipated absence. Cons equences of Non-compliance of Attendance Policies As professionals, students are expected to strictly adhere to the attendance policy. The Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee may consider non -compliance with the Attendance Policy by MS-1 and MS -2 students as a violation of CUSOM policy which may result in disciplinary action. APPS Committee actions include, but are not limited to, loss of remedial privileges; removal from any leadership position with any student club, organization, or student government office; and possible notation of policy violations or professionalism in the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). In extreme cases, absenteeism or tardiness may result in dismissa l from the program. 6.4.3 MS-3 and MS-4 Years Students in third- and fourth- year clinical rotations must abide by the additional attendance requirements described in Section 5.7 of this Bulletin . One hundred percent (100%) attendance on all clinical rotations is expected. Failure to notify the clinical site/preceptor, Regional Site Coordinator, Regional Dean, and the corresponding Third- or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator in the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs of any absen ce from a rotation, regardless of the reason or number of hours absent, may result in completion of a professionalism report with referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. An unexcused absence will result in either a failing or an incomplete grade and result in referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. Students are required to be at their assigned supervised clinical education experience sites for a minimum of forty (40) hours per week, unless the clinical site is open less than forty (40) hours per week. The days and times a student is expected to report is determined by the preceptor and students may be assigned to day, evening, night, weekend or holiday work hours. Preceptors may ask students to rotate their scheduled work hours in order to gain the most clinical experience during times of peak patient flow. During certain clinical 175 rotations, students may be assigned to Saturday and Sunday hours as well. The Campbell Universi ty holiday schedule is independent of the clinical rotation schedule. Third and fourth year students must follow the schedule as outlined by their preceptor for the month. Students are expected to work forty (40) hours per week for four (4) weeks, for a total of 160 contact hours per each four (4) week clinical rotation. See Section 5.7 of this Bulletin for additional information and further details . 6.4.4 Severe Weather P olicy If inclement weather results in changes to class schedules a message will be posted via the website at www.campbell.edu and Facebook, Twitter, and through the Campbell University inclement weather line : On cam pus: dial 5700 Local, but not on campus: dial (910) 814-5700 Long distance: 1-800-760-8980 then dial 5700 In the case of severe weather while on clinical rotations, students should follow the severe weather protocol of their specific clinical site. If the preceptor is present, the student should make every attempt to be present. If the student is unable to get to the clinical site due to unsafe road conditions, the student must communicate this to their preceptor, their Regional Site Coordinator and the Third - or Fourth -Year Student Medical Education Clinical Coordinator immediately. Any time missed due to severe weather must be made up at the discretion of the preceptor, Regional Dean (or DSME, as appropriate), and Associate Dean for Clinical Af fairs, keeping in mind that students must complete the requirements for a four -week rotation block in order to receive credit for the rotation. 6.4.5 Emergency Preparedness Plan Section O ne - Ass essment of Risk The guiding principle behind the assessment of risk for the Campbell University Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM) shall be the protection of life and safety of our students, faculty, and staff. Communication and coordination between the CUSOM Clinical Affairs Depart ment and Regional Deans (or DSMEs, as appropriate) will be crucial to assessing risks within our respective clinical campus regions. CUSOM recognizes that, due to the geographic dispersion of the clinical campuses, events affecting one region might not af fect all regions. For events that are anticipated such as ice storms, hurricanes, or other known events, a meeting will be scheduled 4-5 days in advance of the event to include the Dean of CUSOM, Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, Director and Assistant Director of Clinical Affairs, and Regional Deans (or 176 Pre-Event Communic ation with Instruct ions During ng, Website and Phone Communications DSMEs , as appropriate) to discuss the projected events and the plan for response by each Regional Dean (or DSMEs, as appropriate). Regional Deans (or DSMEs, as appropriate) shall be prepared to discuss their response if the event is \"Green\" which would indicate minimal impact, \"Yellow\" which would indicate a medium level impact, and \"Red\" which would indicate a catastrophic event. Event Category Description Green Event Minimal impact to life and prope rty in the region with expected loss of utilities to last no l onger than 1 -2 days. Yellow Ev ent Mode rate impact to life and prope rty in the region with potential loss of life and moderate damage to local structures. Uti lity failure projections of at least 3-7 days. Red Event Severe impact to life and prope rty in the region with loss of life and severe damage to loc al structures. Parts of the area are uninhabitable for weeks. Water and sewer system failure with power loss projections of greater than 7 days. Regional Deans (or DSMEs, as appropriate) will be the key point of contact for CUSOM and for its students in the respective regions and should print student contact information to keep with them until the event is over. The Regional Deans (or DSMEs, as appropriate), or their representative, will be responsible for contacting each student in their region to make them aware of plans for response to the event at least two (2) days in advance (if known in advance). In an unanticipated event, R egional Deans (or DSMEs, as appropriate) will have the authority to assess the risk and communicate their plans with students and CUSOM Administration their plans. Section T wo - Co mmunication of Risk and Protection of Life Safety CUSOM will send disaster assessment information to students providing instructions on what to do, supplies they should have on hand, and key sources of credible information during the event. The Regional Dean (or DSMEs, as appropriate) will serve as the primary point of contact for students and communicate with them directly during a disaster by email, telephone, or text message. 177 Section T hree - I dentification of Student Whe reabouts and Status Each clinical campus will keep a current list of student cell phone numbers and addresses in a printable format that can be taken home for reference by the Regional Dean (or DSMEs, as appropriate) in an adverse event. If electronic communication is availa ble, a survey may be conducted online requesting student response with his/her condition, location where sheltering, and any needs he/she may have. Section F our - Returning to Clinical Rotations Regional Deans (or DSMEs, as appropriate) will communicate in advance of an adverse event with students in the region to provide specific instructions regarding when students may return to the facility. In addition, Regional Deans (or DSMEs, as appropriate) will provide students in the region information regarding any need for volunteers to assist in disaster response operations. Section Five - Educational Program Conti nuity Regional Deans (or DSMEs, as appropriate) in affected regions, along with the Clinical Affairs Department, will be in frequent contact to discuss relocation of affected students, when necessary, in order to ensure educational program continuity. End -of-rotation exams and Call Back Fridays may be rescheduled or alternate days may be offered depending on the impact of the event on students. Section S ix - Resources for Displaced Students In the event of a catastrophic event, CUSOM may explore arranging temporary housing and assist with other needs to the extent possible. 6.5 Dress C ode Policy Students must maintain a professional appearance and professional attire whenever on CUSOM grounds, including adjacent property at Campbell University and on all clinical experiences or rotations. Students must be professionally dressed for all lectures, examinations, laboratory classes , and workshops. Men must wear dress trousers, appropriate shoes and socks, dress shirt and necktie. Women are required to wear appropriate dresses or skirts of reasonable length for a professional setting (e.g., in the me dical school or any clinical settings ) or slacks with appropriate blouses. Changing areas and lockers are provided for students to change into appropriate dress for OMM, Clinical Skills, and Anatomy labs. All students must have at least one short, white consultation jacket maintained in a clean and presentable condition. 178 A clean and well -cared -for appearance should be maintained. The apparel and appearance of faculty, staff, and students project, in part, the image the community has of the University. Faculty, staff, and students are expected to be neat, well - groomed, and appropriately dressed for the work and study they do. The clothing selected should not be distracting to faculty, staff, or students. Hairstyles should be clean and ne at, avoiding extreme length, styles, or colors. Beards and mustaches must be neat and trimmed at all times. Excessive body piercings are not acceptable. Shorts, jeans, sweatpants, and T -shirts are not permitted except in the OMM and Clinical Skills labs when appropr iate. Revealing or tight, form fitting clothing is unaccep table. Hats (unless for religious reasons), caps, hoodies or sunglasses may not be worn during classes or examinations. Any student wearing a hat (unless for religious reasons), cap, hoodie, or sunglasses will be asked to remove it. Students who have tattoos m ust be aware that clinical rotation sites may require they be covered at all times while on the clinical service. As such CUSOM encourages all students to cover their tattoos starting early on in their medical career while on - campus, and during clinical r otations, except when exposure is required during OMM or Clinical Skills labs. Students inappropriately dressed or groomed may be required to leave the campus or their clinical rotation and not return until appropriately attired. Any class, lab, or clini cal rotation missed during this time will be considered an unexcused absence. Questionable or disputed cases of dress or grooming shall be presented to the Office of Student Affairs or Department of Clinical Affairs, whose decision will be final. Repeated infractions may be considered a professionalism issue resulting in referral to the Academic Performance, Promotion, and Standards (APPS) Committee. Additional Dres s Code Requirements: Certain educational experiences at CUSOM require a specific dress code. These include the laboratory classes of OMM, Anatomy, and Clinical Skills. OMM Laboratory Dress Code The dress requirement in the OMM lab sessions is designed to promote learning by providing optimal access to diagnostic observation and palpatory experience. Wearing inappropriate clothing interferes with a partner's experience of diagnosis and treatment. Appropriate attire must be clean and includes any clothing that allows for easy visualization, examination, palpation, and treatment of the body areas being addressed. 179 Avoid any heavy or thick -seamed clothing, clothing that restricts movement or visualization of the area under examination, and any inappropriately revealing clothing. Students may need to remove their shirts to reveal the back, rib cage and abdomen. Women may wear sports bras or bathing suit tops beneath their shirts or scrubs during these lab sessions. Student s may wear scrubs, or other apparel approved by the Course Director, over laboratory attire when not in the role of the patient. Students must remove their shoes when serving in the role of a patient (no shoes are permitted on the tables). Hats or other head coverings (other than for religious purposes) are not permitted in the OMM lab. Religious head coverings are to be removed when they would obscure the immediate area to be examined or treated (e.g., head, neck, and upper back) and may be immediately replaced after this portion of OMM training. Anatomy Laboratory Dress C ode Lab coats are to be worn in the anatomy lab at all times. CUSOM provides, and launders lab coats and disposable latex -free gloves. It is recommended that the student wear scrubs or old clothes and shoes that can be discarded when the gross anatomy curriculum is over. Wear appropriate clothing and comfortable shoes. The lab is cool, so warm clothing is recommended. Close -toed shoes and long pants are required. Flip-flops, open- toed shoes, shorts and spaghetti -strap tops are not permitte d. For ultrasound laboratories, appropriate attire must be clean and includes any clothing that allows for easy visualization, examination, and palpation of the body areas being addressed, which requires partial exposure of the body. On such days, students will be required to dress in a fashion that will allow examination of these areas (denoted as \"OMM Dress Code\"). Avoid any heavy or thick- seamed clothing; clothing that restricts movement or visualization of the area under examination; and any inappropriately revealing clothing. Students may need to remove their shirts to reveal the back, rib cage and abdomen. Women may wear sports bras or bathing suit tops beneath their shirts or scrubs during these lab sessions. Hats or other head coverings (other than for religious purposes) are not permitted in anatomy or ultrasound labs. In ultrasound labs, religious head coverings are to be removed when they would obscure the immediate area 180 to be examined (e.g., head, neck, a nd upper back) and may be immediately replaced after this portion of ultrasound training. Lockers are available in the locker rooms adjacent to the lab where students may store their gross anatomy lab clothes. Students must provide their own locks and le ave all their personal belongings in a locker instead of stacking them in the fourth floor lobby outside the laboratory. Protective eyewear is suggested but not required (students provide own eyewear). Soft contact lenses are NOT recommended in the lab (they may absorb the chemicals used in the laboratory). Clinical Skills Laboratory Dress Code Students are expected to dress appropriately for Clinical Skills laboratory exercises. Appropriate dress varies based on the activity of the day and are clearly stated in the course syllabi. Unless otherwise stated, students will adhere to the standard \"CUSOM dress code\" as outlined in this Academic Bulletin. White consultation coats are required for all Clinical Skills sessions. The laboratory sessions during Clinical Skills involve physical examination of classmates, models, and standardized patients , and students are expected to demonstrate professionalism when examining patients and classmates. The development of a professional approach is c rucial. Students are required to fully participate in Clinical Skills labs which require physical examination. Randomly selected student lab partners allow for a broad range of exposure and experience diagnosing and treating patients with different body types, both male and female. No student will be required to examine, or be examined by, a classmate or faculty member for breast, genital, or rectal exams. However, there will be sessions, such as when practicing examination of the heart, lungs, abdomen, or extremities, which will require partial exposure of the body. On such days, students will be required to dress in a fashion that will allow examination of these areas (denoted as \"OMM Dress Code\"). Ladies should wear sports bras or bathing suit tops when exposure of the thorax is needed. No short shorts, tight garments, or attire with inappropr iate slo gans, are allowed in Clinical Skills Lab sessions. Lab sessions requiring \"scrubs\" are announced in advance. For all encounters with Standardized Patients, formative and evaluated sessions, white coats are required to be worn. Professional dress and a white coat are required for ALL Final OSCE Examinations. 181 Faculty and staff reserve the right to r efuse admission to students not compl iant with the dress code as set forth in this document. Students who are not permitted to participate in a clinical skills, simulation or OSCE lab or exam due to non- adherence to the dress code will receive an unexcused absence and may be issued a grade of zero (0) for any graded exercise. NO open -toed shoes are permitted at any time during Clinical Skills sessions. You are permitted to wear neat, clean athletic shoes or clogs when wearing \"scrubs\" or \"OMM dress code\". The course syllabi may provide additional r equirements. 6.6 Academic Standing and Progress 6.6.1 Academic Standing and Academic Progress Academic Standing is defined as a student's status at any time within a given academic Block or clinical rotation of the CUSOM curriculum. A student who is in good academic standing is one with a passing grade in all courses or rotations at any given point in time. This information is used in determining eligibility for students to participate in CUSOM approved activities, such as conferen ces, student organiza tions, etc. Students wishing to serve as officers in clubs/organizations or participate in events, travel to meetings or other related activities must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale to be considered. Academic Progress for students in years 1 and 2 of the curriculum requires passing all courses in all Blocks, successfully completing all curricular requirements in the Blocks, passing all components of the end- of-year testing, and meeting the requirements as set forth by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee for students, including those in a Modified Course of Study. Students must also demonstrate adequate development in professionalism as determined by the faculty and administration. In order to be permitted to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1, students must achieve a passing score, as determined by CUSOM, on a CUSOM -identified Qualifying Exam. Each student must pass COMLEX -USA Level 1 in order to be promoted to full third -year status. Successful academic progress for s tudents in Years 3 and 4 of the curriculum includes successful completion of all rotations, end- of-rotation exams, and any other requirements, including but not limited to, clinical modules, procedure and patient logs, Call Back Fridays, and their evaluati ons of the site and their preceptor. In addition, students who have been placed in a Modified Course of Study must meet any requirements set forth by the APPS Committee. 182 Each student must pass the COMLEX -USA Level 2 Cognitive Evaluation (CE) as well as th e COMLEX -USA Level 2 Physical Examination (PE) prior to graduation. In order to be permitted to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE, the student must achieve a passing score on a CUSOM -identified Qualifying Exam. If a student fails to attain the passing score after three (3) attempts at the Qualifying Exam, the student will be required to successfully complete a board preparation program prescribed by CUSOM, such as Boards Boot Camp (http://www .boardsboo tcamp.com ), at the student's expense and not to exceed a timeframe established b y the AP PS Committee. In order to be permitted to take COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE, the student must successfully pass an Objective Structural Clinical Examination (OSCE) administered during Residency Development month. If the student fails to pass this OSCE, they will undergo a remediation program at the direction of the Assistant Dean for Clinical Education or designee. Students are not released to take the COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE exam until approve d by the Assistant Dean for Clinical Education or designee. Students who experience difficulty successfully completing elements of the CUSOM curriculum or any level of the COMLEX examination series in a timely manner according to the academic calendar may be required to complete a board preparation program or be placed into a combination curriculum/remediation program (Modified Course of Study). Students placed in a Modified Course of Study must agree to comply with the plan as determined by t he APPS Committee. As long as the student is making satisfactory progress in the Modified Course of Study, they will remain in full - time status. Students who do not follow the Modified Course of Study, or who do not make satisfactory academic progress wh ile in a Modified Course of Study, may be referred to the APPS Committee for additional required remediation, or additional sanctions up to, and including, dismissal from the program. Fourth- year students should refer to S ection 6.9.1 of this Bulletin for further information regarding graduation requirements. Students not making satisfactory academic progress towards graduation will be referred to the APPS Committee for review and further recommendations, which may include but is not limited to, placement on a Modified Course of Study, Academic Probation or Dismissal from the program. 183 6.6.2 National Boar d (Licensing) Exa ms Students are required to pass the COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX- USA Level 2 -CE, and the COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE prior to graduation as outlined in the table of milestones below. Milestones for Each CUSOM Student Successful Completion of All Courses During Blocks 1 -8 Satisfactory Completion of a Qualifying Exam for COMLEX -USA Level 1 Successful Completion of COM LEX-USA Level 1 Successful Completion of COM AT/Equivalent Subject Examinations for Core Rotations Satisfactory Evaluation by Clinical Faculty for Each Clinical Rotation Successful Completion of Third-Year OSCEs which Assesses Student Preparedness for the CO MLEX-USA Level 2-PE Exam Satisfactory Completion of a Qualifying Exam for COMLEX Level 2-CE Successful Completion of COM LEX-USA Level 2-CE Successful Completion COM LEX-USA Level 2-PE Accomm odations on COMLEX -USA Exams Students who want to request accommodations for any COMLEX -USA examination must submit their applications directly to the NBOME within the timeframe designated by the NBOME. Please contact the NBOME directly for more information (http://www.nbome.org./ ). CUSOM is not responsible for request ing or approving COMLEX -USA testing accommodations. COMLEX -USA Level 1 CUSOM students complete the Clinical Applications of Biomedical Sciences (CABS) I and II courses in Blocks 5 and 8, respectively, and MUST sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1 prior to July 1 in the period between the second and third academic year. Prior to receiving their COMLEX - USA Level 1 scores, all students, including those on appeal for failure to complete any required coursework, may be considered \"provisional\" third year students and allowed to participate in clinical rotations. Full third -year status is not granted until a student passes COMLEX -USA Level 1. Students are provided a course of study within Block 8 which serves as a capstone to the first two years of the curriculum and should assist in final preparation for national licensing exams. This course of study is credit - bearing and is provided by CUSOM. 184 In order to be permitted to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 1, the student must achieve a pre -identified \"passing\" score on a Qualifying Exam. CUSOM identifies the passing parameters by the end of Block 5 each year. CUSOM pays for the first Qualifying Ex am, however students may be responsible for the cost of subsequent exams or programs. Students are allowed three (3) attempts to achieve a minimum pre -identified score on the Qualifying Exam. Students are permitted to register for COMLEX -USA Level 1 prio r to passing the qualifying exam; however, students failing to meet the minimum CUSOM pre -identified score are not permitted to take COMLEX -USA Level 1. Students who do not pass the Qualifying Exam (QE) after three (3) attempts , or are unable to take a QE as scheduled, are referred to the APPS C ommittee and placed in a Modified Course of Study, during which they will be required to complete a Boards preparation program . This online program is the Boards Boot Camp Ultra Program (http://www.boardsbootcamp.com ). This program will be at the student's expense and will not to exceed a timeframe established by the APPS Committee , unless the APPS Committee revisits the original timeline for non -compliance or some other relevant issue. A Modified Course of Study (MCOS) is a credit -bearing, individualized study plan for students who require an alternative educational pathway for reasons such as mandated board preparation, requi red remediation, illness, leave of absence, or withdrawal . Students in a Modified Course of Study must agree to, and comply with, the conditions and schedule of the Modified Course of Study. Students not following the individualized plan may be placed on Suspension (ineligible for financial aid and not considered an active student) at any time . Upon successful completion of the designated board preparation course of the Modified Course of Study, the student is required to take COMLEX - USA Level 1 within a timeframe established by the APPS Committee. Students assigned to a Boards preparation program must meet all program requirements, which includes, but is not limited to, strict adherence to all timelines related to the completion of study assignments and assessment examinatio ns. Failure to do so will result in a return visit to APPS Committee with possible sanctions imposed for non- adherence to the agreed process. 185 Failure of COMLEX -USA Level 1 Any stude nt who fails COMLEX -USA Level 1 must meet with the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. The student will be placed on Academic Probation and subject to sanctions as described below. Students who fail COMLEX -USA Level 1 are required to complete a Boards preparation program prescribed by CUSOM, such as, but not limited to, Boards Boot Camp ( http://www.boardsbootcamp.com ), at the student's expense and within a timeframe established by the APPS Committee. This requires the student to enter a Modified Course of Study (MCOS). A student who fails COMLEX -USA Level 1 on their first attempt, but has already completed a CUSOM -approved or designated Boards preparation program prior to taki ng COMLEX -USA Level 1, may be placed on Suspension (ineligible for financial aid and not an active student) or be required to complete a different preparation program prescribed by CUSOM, such as, but not limited to the PASS Program ( https://www.pass - progr am.com/ ). Participation in the required preparation program will be at the student's expense and within a timeframe established by the APPS Committee. This requires the student to enter a MCOS . If the student is already on a MCOS , adjustments to the MCO S may be required. In either case, a Modified Course of Study may result in a delay in the completion of program requirements and graduation, which may in turn affect their ability to participate in the residency match process. Upon successful completion of the remedial program, the student is required to retake COMLEX -USA Level 1 for the second attempt within a timeframe established by the APPS Committee. Any student who fails COMLEX -USA Level 1 a second time must again meet with the APPS Committee. Th e student may be placed on Suspension (ineligible for financial aid and not an active student) or be required to complete a boards preparation program prescribed by CUSOM, such as, but not limited to, the PASS Program ( https://www.pass -program.com/ ) at the student's expense and within a time frame established by the APPS Committee. This requires the student to enter a Modified Course of Study (MCOS). If the student is already on a Modified Course of Study, adjustments to the MCOS may be required. In either case, a Modified Course of Study may result in a delay in the completion of program requirements and graduation, which may in turn affect their ability to partic ipate in the residency match process. Upon successful completion of the remedial program, the student is required to retake COMLEX -USA Level 1 for the third, and final, time within a timeline designated by the APPS Committee. A student is permitted only three (3) attempts to pass COMLEX -USA Level 1, after which they will be dismissed from the program. 186 Students who have been removed from clinical rotations for a COMLEX - USA Level 1 failure may be permitted to return to clinical rotations following their retaking of the exam, while waiting for release of their COMLEX -USA Level 1 score. COMLEX -USA Level 2-CE and COMLEX -USA Level 2-PE Third -year students must take and pass an end -of-rotation exam after each core rotation. In addition to demonstrating the student has learned the appropriate material on the rotation, the se exams function to prepare students for COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE. In addition, at the end of the third year students must take and pass Standardized Patient (SP) Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) exams. These exams are administered to assure the student has competently achieved the clinical skills expected in the third year and to prepare the student for COMLEX - USA Level 2 -PE testing. Students must schedule their COMLEX -USA Le vel 2 -CE no later than March 15 of the MS -3 year and take the exam no later than November 1 of the MS -4 year unless otherwise approved. In order to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE, the student must achieve a passing score as determined by CUSOM on a Qualify ing Exam, such as a CUSOM -proctored College of Osteopathic Medicine Self -Assessment Exam (COMSAE) or a similar exam. CUSOM identifies the passing parameters for this exam and pays for the first Qualifying Exam, with students responsible for the cost of subsequent exams. Students are permitted to register for COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE prior to passing the Qualifying Exam; however, students failing to meet the minimum CUSOM pre -identified score on three (3) consecutive attempts are not permitted to take COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE. Students who do not pass the Qualifying Exam after three (3) consecutive attempts are referred to the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) committee and the student will be required to complete a Boards preparation program . This online program is the Boards Boot Camp Ultra Program ( http://www.boardsbootcamp.com ). This program will be at the student's expense and will not to exceed a timeframe established by the APPS Committee, unless the APPS Committee revisits the original timeline for non -compliance or some other relevant issue. The APPS Comm ittee may recommend a student be removed from clinical rotations while completing a Boards preparation program. 187 Students assigned to a Boards preparation program must meet all program requirements, which includes, but is not limited to, strict adherence to all timelines related to the completion of study assignments and assessment examinations. Failure to do so will result in a return visit to APPS Committee with possible sanctions imposed for non -adherence to the agreed process . In order to sit for COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE, the student must successfully pass the Objective Structural Clinical Examination (OSCE), which is administered dur ing Residency Development month, which corresponds to the first rotation of the fourth year. If the student fails to pass the OS CE, the student will unde rgo a remedi ation program at the d irection of the Assistant Dean for Clinical Education or other de signee. Students are not released to take the COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE exam until approve d by the Assistant Dean for Clinical Education or other designee. Students who fail the OSCE exam are required to successfully complete the designated remediation program a minimum of fourteen (14) days prior to taking COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE. Students who do not successfully remediate will have their COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE release withdrawn. Students are required to take COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE by October 1 in their fourth year. As it takes a minimum of ninety (90) days to receive scores for COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE, it may be to the student's advantage to take this exam earlier in order to provide the student with ample time to retake the exam prior to graduation in the case the student does not pass the exam. Passing both COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE and COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE is required to graduate. In addition, most residency programs require students to pass COMLEX - USA Level 2 -CE to match with their program. Some residency programs also require proof of passing COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE prior to interviewing with their program. The student must report to the Office of Clinical Affairs when National Board examinations will be taken (please see below). For time off, (e.g., Natio nal Boards) the clinical faculty preceptor, Regional Dean/DSME, and Regional Site Student Medical Education Coordinator will be notified, and the student will not be required to work nor make up the time missed. Eligible students shall be granted permission to be absent from their clinical service in order to take the COMLEX -USA examination (one (1) day). If not administered locally, adequate travel time (one (1) day before) will be permitted. Students must provide notice to their clinical faculty precep tor, Regional Dean/DSME (if at a core CUSOM training site), and the Office of 188 Clinical Affairs at least two (2) weeks in advance of their scheduled examination date. Students are expected to report to their rotation in the usual manner, the day after the examination day, unless travel exceeds 200 miles. Dates for COMLEX -USA Examinations can be found at this website: of COMLEX -USA Level 2-CE Any fails either COMLEX -USA Level 2-CE or COMLEX - USA Level 2 -PE must meet with the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee. The student will be placed on Academic Probation and subject to sanctions as described below. Students are not removed from Suspension until they demonstrate a passing score on the deficient exam(s). Students on Suspension for a period exceeding six (6) months will be reviewed by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee and are subject t o dismissal from the program. Any student who fails the student initial attempt on COMLEX -USA Level 2-CE will be immediately placed on Academic Probation and, as determined by the APPS Committee, will be withdrawn from clinical rotations until the student successfully passes the exam. Any student who fails COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE must meet with the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and the APPS Committee within seven (7) days of receiving a failing score. Students who fail COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE will be required to complete a remedial program prescribed by CUSOM, such as, but not limited to, Boards Boot Camp ( http://www.boardsbootcamp.com ), at the student's expense and within a time frame establishe d by the APPS Committee. Upon successful completion of the remedial program, the student will be required to retake COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE within a timeframe established by the APPS Committee. Students assigned to a Boards preparation program must meet al l program requirements, which includes, but is not limited to, strict adherence to all timelines related to the completion of study assignments and assessment examinations. Failure to do so will result in a return visit to APPS Committee with possible san ctions imposed for non- adherence to the agreed process. Students who have been removed from clinical rotations due to a COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE failure are placed in a Modified Course of Study and may be permitted to return to clinical rotations following their retaking of the exam while waiting for release of their COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE score by the NBOME. Students who are unsuccessful on the second attempt of the COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE will be referred to the 189 APPS Committee and may be placed on Suspension (ineligible for financial aid). Students on Suspension for a period exceeding six (6) months will be reviewed by the Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee and may be dismissed from the program. A student is permitted only three ( 3) attempts to pass COMLEX -USA Level 2 -CE, after which the student will be dismissed from the program. A Modifi ed Course of Study (MCOS) is individually designed based upon the student's performance and needs by the respective Asso ciate Dean and approve d by the APPS Com mittee. Students in a Modifi ed Course of Study must agree to and compl y with the conditions and schedule of the Modifi ed Course of Study. Students not follo wing the MCOS m ay be placed on Suspension (thus ine ligible for financial aid and not c onside red an active student) at any time. Students must pass COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX- USA Level 2 -CE and COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE in order to meet graduation requirements. Students are allowed a maximum of three (3) attempts to pass each of these exams. Failure to pass any of these exams during the required timeframe will result in a referral to the APPS Committee and will result in dismissal from the program. 6.6.3 Modified Course of Study A Modified Course of Study (MCOS) is a credit -bearing, individualized study plan for students who require an alternative educational pathway for reasons such as mandated board preparation, required remediation, illness, leave of absence, or withdrawal . The MCOS will be individually designed based upon the student's performance and needs by the respective Associate Dean and approved by the APPS Committee. Students in a MCOS must agree to, and comply with, the conditions and schedule of the MCOS . Students not following the MCOS may be placed on Suspension (ineligible for financial aid and not considered an active student) at any time. During clinical rotations, students following a MCOS should be aware that they must complete all program requirements to graduate, enter ERAS (Electronic Residency Application Service) and participate in the Match. Students who fail COMLEX Level 2 -PE or COMLEX Level 2 -CE after the Match may lose their match ed position. In addition, students who fail to meet their graduation requirements in adequate time to start their residency program may also lose their matched position. These decisions are made by the Residency Program Director or Director of Medical Ed ucation at the respective hospital. A student in a MCOS who does not adhere to the requirements and parameters of the MCOS, including but not limited to, not following directions of an assigned program such as Boards Boot Camp or the PASS Program, may be referred to the APPS Committee for further action and m ay be placed on Suspension. 190 6.7 Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee The APPS Committee, in conjunction with the Office of Academic Affairs, monitors the academic progress achieved by all students throughout the entire CUSOM academic program. The APPS Committee meets at the end of any Block or clinical rotation to review students who have achieved a failing course or clinical rotation grade, failed to successfully remediate a failed course, when a delay in a student's academic progress is identified, or when deemed necessary. The Chair of the APPS Committee or the appropriate Associate Dean for the academic year involved may also call a meeting of the APPS Committee in case s where the academic progress of a student is affected by a leave of absence or other factors. Additionally, the APPS Committee is responsible for the review of situations where students are involved in academic misconduct (i.e., cheating or plagiarism), violations of the Honor Code or Code of Misconduct, or unprofessional conduct. Additional information regarding these violations is found in Section s 6.10.3- 6.10.5 of this Bulletin - \"Honor Code, Code of Misconduct, and Grievance Procedures\". The APPS Committee is appointed by the Dean, and membership may be subject to change at any time. The Registrar and Executive Director of Student Affairs participate as voting members. A quorum is defined as a simple majority of the members. The committee Chair, with approval of the Dean, may invite non -voting members to attend. As APPS Committee meetings are considered academic proceedings and not legal hearings , neither attorneys nor other representatives are allowed. 6.7.1 Procedures for Calling and Conducting an APPS Committee Meeting Regarding Academic Performance APPS Committee meetings are held at the end of each Block or clinical rotation, after the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs have determined all grades, or as needed. Reasons for an APPS Committee hearing include, but are not limited to , if a student has: Failed a course Attempted and failed to remediate a course Failed to pa ss any course while on Acad emic Probation Failed a clinical rotation Failed an end -of-rotation exam Violated the CUSOM Honor Code Violate d any CUSOM or Campbell Unive rsity policy/procedure or provision of this Bulletin Failed to pa ss a Qualifying Exam within the required number of attempts 191 Failed to pa ss an appropriate COMLEX-USA e xamination Failed to make acade mic progress, or follow directives set forth, in an assigned remediation plan, any Board preparation programs, or any Modified Course of Study Failed a c ontrolled substance screening test Received f indings on a criminal backg round check that would affect the student's matriculation or a clinical rotation Failed to adhere to set timelines/due dates Failed to respond in timely manner to email and other forms of communication from CUSOM. Upon initial review of a referral of a student to the APPS Committee, the Chair of the APPS Committee may determine an intermediary action, such as the student meeting with the appropriate Associate Dean or other designated individual, may be warranted in an e ffort to resolve the issue in lieu of an APPS Committee hearing. 6.7.2 APPS Committee Proced ures for Academic Performance Matters The Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or designee, will Chair the APPS Committee. Members of the APPS Committee have the following roles: The appropriate Associate Dean for the academic year involved reports on the academic progress of student(s), as necessary.

The Registrar is available to discuss the student's academic record if needed. The APPS Committee Chair shall identify a secretary to record minutes and to ensure all communications occur in a timely manner. Each student reviewed by the APPS Committee is provided the opportunity to make a maximum of a ten -minute presentation (no Power Points or handouts) relevant to an y issues or considerations that the student wish es to make known to the APPS Committee. Members of the APPS Committee may then directly question the student. This is the only portion of the meeting at which the stud ent may be physically present. In lieu of an in- person presentation, the student may be allowed to phone in to the APPS Committee meeting, and has the option to submit a written document, no more than two pages, single -spaced. These options are only avai lable upon approval by the Chair of the APPS C ommittee, pending a valid reason for not presenting in person. 192 All sessions of the APPS Committee are closed to all individuals except those immediately concerned in the case. No legal counsel shall be present , as this is not a legal proceeding. All persons present at the proceedings shall be bound to disclose no more than the Committee does in its official report on the case. All deliberations, minutes, findings, and recommendations of the APPS Committee functions remain confidential except where the student waives confidentiality or the release is required by law. For students failing to make academic progress including, but not limited to, multiple grades of IC in one Block/clinical rotation or across m ore than one Block/clinical rotation, failure of a course or any clinical rotation, or failure to successfully complete any curricular requirements, the APPS Committee may impose a sanction including, but not limited to , any combination of the following: Award a satisfactory grade (C*, P*, or PC*) and promotion to the next Block/clinical rotation following satisfactory remediation Require remediation, further coursework, repeat of courses, or write a topic -specific paper Require the student to repeat multiple courses in which the student initially earned a failing grade Specify a timeline or manner in which any remediation must occur Require the successful completion of one or more additional clinical rotations and associated requirements including but not limited to educational modules, procedure logs and end- of-rotation exams (even if previously taken and passed) Place a student on a defined term of Academic Warning or Acade mic Probation Extend a student's term of Academic Warning or Acad emic Probation Remove a student from clubs/organizations or leadership roles Require more frequent meetings with CUSOM's Academic Center for Excellence or faculty advisors Request further assessment to verify the student has the ability to make satisfactor y progress to become an osteopathic physician including but not limited to, psychological evaluations, controlled substance or alcohol screening/testing, or other evaluations. Such testing will be at the student's expense. Require the student to attend ta rgeted workshops or programs such as, but not limited to, North Carolina Physician 's Health Program, sensitivity training, or anger management Assign a Modified Course of Study which may delay promotion and graduation until satisfactory progress through a directed remediation program has occurred In addition to imposing the above sanctions for failure to make academic progress, the Committee may review student progress in order to remove students from Academic Warning, Academic Probation , or Suspension. 193 The APPS Committee may also recommend to the Dean Suspension or Dismissal of a student from the program when the APPS Committee determines the student is unable to make academic progress due to, but not limited to , any combination of the following: Failure of two or more courses in any one Block in Years 1 and 2 of the curriculum Failure to successfully remediate a failed course is considered an additional course failure Failure of three or more total courses in Years 1 and 2 of the curriculum Failur e of two or more total clinical rotations Failure of any course or clinical rotation while i n a Modified Course of Study Failure of any course or clinical rotation while on Academic Probation Any other issues deemed relevant. The APPS Committee Chair will notify the student in writing of the outcome of the APPS Committee meeting and any applicable sanctions as soon as practical. Upon receipt of notification, the student must sign a Notice of Decision either accepting the terms of the decision, or signing the Notice of Decision to appeal the decision, within the timeframe defined in the Notice of Decision. An appeal of the APPS Committee decision by the student must be made in writing to the Dean within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of notification and be based only upon new and relevant information not available to the APPS Committee at the time of the hearing. The Dean will reply within fourteen (14) calendar days of receiving the written appeal. If the student does not appeal within seven (7) cale ndar days of receipt of notification, the APPS Committee decision is final. An appeal not received in the Office of the Dean by 5:00pm Eastern seven (7) calendar days after receipt of notification will not be considered, and the decision of the APPS Committee will be considered final. The Dean does not meet with the student prior to receiving the required written appeal material, and the student must make no attempt t o meet with the Dean immediately prior to the APPS Committee meeting or between the date of the APPS Committee meeting and the date of any potential appeal hearing. No legal counsel shall be present at an appeal meeting with the Dean, as these meetings are not legal proceedings. The Dean's decision is final . 194 6.7.3 Procedur es for N on-Academic Matters Allegations of misconduct may arise from an individual student, group of students, faculty member, clinical preceptor or staff member. For issues arising from Honor Code, Code of Misconduct, or professionalism violations, the person(s) identifying the iss ue(s) should report the issue(s) to the Executive Director of Student Affairs or the respective Associate Dean (Biomedical or Clinical) within seven (7) calendar days of the incident. The Executive Director of Student Affairs or respective Associate Dean will collect documentation which may be relevant to the alleged violation. This may include, but is not limited to, a written report from the student(s), faculty or staff involved with the incident(s). In the case where students are reporting the suspect ed violation, unless required at a hearing, waived by the subject(s) of the alleged violation, or required by law, confidentiality of the reporting student is maintained, and the Executive Director of Student Affairs or respective Associate Dean will present the reporting student's testimony. Dated notes are taken to describe the discussion. The Executive Director of Student Affairs or respective Associate Dean, notifies the Associate Dean for Clinical Integration of the suspected misconduct or violation and provides him/her with a detailed summary of the reason for referral along with all supporting documentation. The Associate Dean for Clinical Integration then, (i) constitutes an ad hoc committee to investigate the suspected misconduct, who reports the ir findings in writing to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or (ii) depending upon the severity of the allegations, refers the matter directly to the APPS Committee. 6.7.4 Rights of the Student / R esponde nt With respect to a hearing regarding academic misconduct, an alleged violation of the student Honor Code, or the Code of Misconduct, and/or professionalism standards, the Student / Respondent(s) is guaranteed the right to: a timely hearing, if requested receive notice of the allegation(s) at least th ree (3) days prior to the hearing a presumption of innocence until proven guilty solicit advice expect the case to be adjudicated in a confidential manner appeal the decision to the Dean 6.7.5 Ad hoc Comm ittee Proced ures If referred to an ad hoc Committee, the Chair of the ad hoc Committee will schedule a hearing with the ad hoc Committee and notify the accused student(s) (the \"Respondent\") at least three (3) days prior to the hearing.

If, based upon a preponderance of the evidence, the ad hoc Committee recommends, or the APPS Committee determines, the student was in violation of the Honor Code, the Code of Misconduct, a CUSOM policy, or the professional standards of CUSOM, the ad hoc Committee may recommend or the APPS Committee may render an appropriate sanction including, but not limited to : Admonition: Student will receive a written warning . An Admonition will not become a part of the student's longitudinal record and is not reported in the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). An Admonition may not be appealed by the student. In certain circumstances, the APPS Committee Chair may determine a referral to the Committee warrants an Admonition, and may directly assign that sanction if the stu dent agrees to waive their meeting with the APPS Committee. Academic Warning: Students who fail any course or clinical rotation will be placed on Academic Warning for a specified time period, or otherwise designated by the Dean. The record of each student on Academic Warning is reviewed at the end of the specified time period, to evaluate the student's academic progress and the APPS Committee makes any recommendations regarding the continuation or removal of Academic Warning.

All APPS Committee meeting minutes and evidence are maintained in the Office of the Dean. The decision of the A PPS Committee shall be sent to the Respondent(s) in writing within seven (7) calendar days of the APPS decision. Upon receipt of notification, the student must sign a Notice of Decision either accepting the terms of the decision, or signing the Notice of Decision to appeal the decision. An appeal to the Dean must be based only upon new and relevant information not available to the ad hoc Committee, the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or the APPS Committee at the time of the hearing and be made in writing to the Dean within seven (7) calendar days of receipt of notification. The Dean will reply within fourteen (14) calendar days of receiving the written appeal.

The withdrawn student may a lso be barred from re -enrollment until specific conditions have been met. Dismissal from the program without the option to return. The Dean's decision is final. 200 6.7.8 Special Meet ings of the APPS Committee The Dean may call a meeting of the APPS Committee to determine placement of a student who is returning from an approved extended leave or Suspension to determine where the student will resume the program and to determine if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is require d. 6.8 Separation from the Program 6.8.1 Separation from CUSOM There are four (4) categories of separation from CUSOM: Leave of Absence Withdrawal Suspension Dismissal The Dean makes all final decisions regarding any separation from CUSOM. All current or former students returning from an a pproved period away from CUSOM ( such as, but not limited to, a Leave of Absence or an offer to repeat an academic year ), minimally must submit a completed Secondary Application, Background Check, and Controlled Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, but no later than sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated return date. Additional requirements, such as a medical or psychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropria te. A subset of the Admissions Committee, consisting of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, will determine whether or not the student i s offered acceptance. Students who do not return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the requirements for return, will need to re -apply through AACOMAS and will not be guaranteed re -admission. In order to return from any approved separation, the student must provide the Dean with documentation verifying completion of the terms of the approved separation. Once approved for return, the APPS Committee will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved separation to deter mine where the student will resume the curriculum and if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the cu rriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the medical education curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on licensing exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. 201 6.8.2 Leave of Absence A Leave of Absence is granted by the Dean. A leave of absence is a temporary separation from CUSOM which may not last longer than 180 calendar days. Reasons for a leave include, but are not limited to, academic, personal, medical, and maternity. If a leave exceeds beyond 180 calendar days, it will become a Withdrawal. A Leave of Absence is requested in writing, addressed to the Dean and delivered to the Executive Director of Student Affairs , who then provides it to the Dean. A Leave of Absence request m ust also include an anticipated date of return. The Dean in turn makes the final determination on the Leave of Absence request. A Leave of Absence request requires completion of a Leave of Absence form and may or may not require the return of CUSOM issued items depending upon the specific circumstances of the Leave of Absence. The date for a Leave of Absence is the date of the Dean's approval of the Leave of Absence request. 6.8.3 Academic Leave of Absence An Academic Leave of Absence is a unique situation, usually of a one -year duration, which allows students to pursue a research opportunity or complete a one -year post -secondary degree. Upon completion of this additional educational, experiential activity or scholarly pursuit, the st udent a Background Check, and Controll ed Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, but no later than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the anticipated return date. In order to return from any approved Academic Leave of Absence, the student must provide doc umen tation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Academic Leave of Absence and an anticipated date of return. Once approved for return, the APPS Committee will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved Academic Leave of Absence to determine where the student will resume the curriculum and if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the medical education curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on board exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. Students who do no t return on the approved date, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the r equirements for return, will need to re-apply throu gh AACOMAS and will not be guaranteed re-admission. 202 6.8.4 Personal L eave of Absence A Personal Leav e of Absence is granted by the Dean and m ay not last longer than 180 calen dar days. A Personal Leav e of Absence is available to address situations such a s a death of a spouse, child, or such other circumstance that would in terrupt a student 's educat ion. In order to return from any approved Personal Leav e of Absence, the student must provide the Dean with doc umen tation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Personal Leav e of Absence, including an anticipated date of return . Once approved for return, the APPS Committee will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved separation to determine where the student will resume the curriculum and if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the medical education curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on licensing exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. Students who do not return on the approved date, or othe rwise do not fulfill all of the r equirements for return, will need to re-apply throu gh AACOMAS and will not be g uaranteed re-admission. 6.8.5 Med ical Leave of Absence (Absence Less than 180 Calendar Days) A Medical Leave of Absence may be granted to students who are in good academic standin g, who provide acceptable supporti ng document ation indicating a valid medi cal reason requiri ng a leave of less than 180 calendar days and an anticipated date of return . Decis ions regarding the granting of a medi cal leave are determined by the Dean. A Medical Leave of Absence may last no longer than 180 calendar days, if the leave extends beyond 180 calendar days it will automatically become a Medical Withdrawal as described below . In order to return from an approved medi cal leave, the stude nt must provide the Dean with doc umen tation from a physician approving/releasing the student to return as a full-time student in the c urriculum. Once approved for return, the APPS Committee will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved medical leave to determine where the student will resume the curriculum and if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled wi th a focus on ensuring the 203 appropriate co ntinuum of the medical education curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on licensing exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. Students who do not return on the approved date, or othe rwise do not fulfill all of the r equirements for return, will need to re-apply throu gh AACOMAS and will not be g uaranteed re-admission. 6.8.6 Student Maternity Leave of Absence CUSOM may grant leave for students who give birth while enrolled in the curriculum. A Student Maternity Leave of Absence may be granted to students who are in good academic standing, who provide acceptable supporting documentation indicating a clearance from her treating physician to return and an expected date of return to CUSOM on a full -time, unrestricted basis. Decisions regarding the granting of a maternity leave are determined by the Dean. A Student Maternity Leave of Absence extending more than 180 calendar days will require the student to file for request a Medical Withdrawal. The student will meet with either the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS-1 and MS-2), or Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs (MS -3 & MS -4), and the Executive Director of Student Affairs at the earliest available time to discuss the anticipated maternity leave. The student will provide the Executive Director of Student Affairs a proposed timeline of requested leave. The student will provide a medical note from her medical provider with an anticipated return -to-school date. This date should be the date when the student is medically cleared to resume all activities of the curriculum as a full -time student, with no restrictions. If the treating physician places an activity o r time restriction on the student, the nature of the restriction(s) and the time frame for these restrictions must be well defined. Based on the date o f return to full -time status, either the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs ( MS-1 and MS-2 students ), or the Associat e for Clinical Affairs ( MS-3 and MS-4 students ) will develop a proposed Modified Schedule. The student will meet with either the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS-1 and MS-2), or Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs (MS -3 and MS-4) and the Executive Director of Student Affairs to review and discuss the proposed Modified Schedule. The student will sign the Attestation section after any additional changes are made and agreed upon by all parties. 204 The student will provide medical documentation to the Executive Director of Student Affairs from her medical provider documenting full medical clearance for return, including a definitive date of return. The Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS -1 and MS-2), will contact and inform t he Course Directors and the Assistant Director of Medical Education for the affected courses of the Modified Schedule, and the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs (MS -3 and MS-4) will contact and inform the appropriate Regional Dean/Director of Student Medical Education, clerkship coordinator and Registrar of the Modified Schedule. The Executive Director of Student Affairs will notify the Chief of Operations of the Modified Schedule. 6.8.7 Parental Leave of Absence CUSOM may grant leave for students whose significant other gives birth, while enrolled in the curriculum. A Parental Leave of Absence may be granted on a case- by-case basis. Students requesting a parental leave of absence must be in good academic standing and provide a ppropriate documentation. A Parental Leave of Absence may be up to four (4) weeks for non- birth parents following the birth, or adoption, of a child. The student will meet with either the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS-1 & MS -2) or Associate D ean for Clinical Affairs (MS -3 & MS -4), and the Executive Director of Student Affairs at the earliest available time to discuss the anticipated Student Maternity/Paternity Leave. The student provides the Executive Director of Student Affairs a proposed timeline of the requested leave. Once the anticipated dates of the leave are determined, the student will complete the CUSOM Leave of Absence Request and obtain the necessary signatures prior to the final signature from the Dean. The student must meet with the Registrar, the Assistant Director of Financial Aid, and the Campbell University Business Office. The Office of Student Affairs will notify the entities listed below of the Leave of Absence and provide a copy of the approved signed Leave of Absence fo rm. Registrar's Office Financial Aid Office Following the birth or adoption, the non- birth parent will provide the Office of Student Affairs with an anticipated return -to-school date. 205 Once an anticipated return date is identified, either the Associate D ean for Biomedical Affairs for MS -1 & MS -2 students or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs for MS -3 & MS -4 students will develop a proposed Modified Schedule. The Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs will work with the Course Directors, Medical Educa tion, and Student Affairs to develop the Modified Schedule. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs will work with the student's Regional Dean/Director of Student Medical Education, Clerkship Coordinator, Registrar, and Student Affairs to develop the Modif ied Schedule. The student will meet with either the Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS-1 & MS -2) or Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs (MS -3 & MS -4) and the Executive Director of Student Affairs to review and discuss the proposed Modified Schedule . The Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs (MS -1 & MS -2) will contact and inform the Course Directors and the Director of Medical Education and Accreditation for the affected courses of the Modified Schedule and the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs (MS -3 & MS -4) will contact and inform the appropriate Regional Dean/Director of Student Medical Education, Clerkship Coordinator of the Modified Clinical Rotations Schedule. 6.8.8 Withdrawal Withdrawal from CUSOM is granted by the Dean. A Withdrawal may be a temporary separation from CUSOM , which m ay last longer than 180 calen dar days or permanent separation from CUSOM. Reasons for a withdrawal include, but are not limited to, personal and medical. Any request for Withdrawal must be completed prior to beginning the first final course assessment (e.g., exam) of a Block or clinical rotation (e.g., end -of- rotation exam). This would include courses ending earlier than other courses in a Block (e.g., a student would need to withdraw before completing the Foundations in Medical Practice course, which typically ends prior to finals week). Failure to withdraw by this date may result in issuance of a grade of F for all courses in that Block, or for that rotation, which will be recorded on the student's transcri pt and adversely affect the student's GPA. A student may not withdraw if a grade h as been assigne d or if a final examination or a ssessment event has been st arted. Withdrawal from a course or clinical rotation after an examination has been administered and/or a clinical rotation completed, will result in the final grade being the grade of record. As such, a Withdra wal cannot remove a grade of F. A Withdr awal is requested in writing, addressed to the Dean and delivered to the Executive Director of Student Affairs , who then provides it to the Dean. The Dean in turn makes the final determination on the Withdrawal request. 206 The student must comple te and return a Withdrawal Form and any designated CUSOM issued items to the Office of Student Affairs b efore the stu dent wi ll be conside red Withdrawn in Good S tanding. The date for a Withdr awal is the d ate of the Dean's approval of the W ithdrawal request. The Dean makes the final decision regarding Withdrawals. Students who discontinue their education at CUSOM, for any reason, are required to complete a Withdrawal Form. Upon receipt of the completed Withdrawal Form and CUSOM issued items, the student is Withdrawn in Good Standing f rom CUSOM and entitled to certain benefits, i.e., application for readm ission or issuance of an official transcript if requested. Students on S uspension may not withdraw. Students eligible to r eturn from a Withdrawal f rom CUSOM , minimally a comple cation, Backg round Check, and Controll ed Substance Screen with in a timeframe designated by CUSOM, but no lat er than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the anticipated return date. Additional requiremen ts, such as a medical or p sychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. Students eligible to return from a Withdrawal may be required to provide the Dean with doc umen tation verifying completion of the terms of the approved Withdrawal. A subs et of the Adm issions Committee, consist ing of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Asso ciate Dean for Clinical Integration and Asso ciate Dean for Cl inical Affairs, will determine whether or not the student is offered accept ance. Once approved for return, the APPS Com mittee will determine pla cement of the student in the c urriculum and if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is r equired. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the approp riate continuum of the medical education curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on licensing exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. NOTE: Althoug h dif ferent ca tegories of W ithdraw al are identified, the student transcript will r eflect a \"W\" for any approved Withdrawal. 207 6.8.9 Personal Wit hdrawal A Personal Withdrawal will be granted to students who wish to voluntarily leave CUSOM for personal reasons. Students withdrawing from CUSOM for personal reasons are not guaranteed re -admission. To be deemed Withdrawn in Good Standing, the student must have passed all classes and be in good academic standing, complete all required paperwork and follow all CUSOM procedures during the withdrawal process. Students eligible to return from a Personal Withdrawal may be required to provide the Dean with documentation verifying completion of the terms of the approved withdrawal. A subset of the Admissions Committee, consisting of the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, Associate Dean for Biomedical Affairs, Associate Dean for Clinical Integration and Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs, will determine whether or not the student is offered acceptance. Once approved for return, the APPS Committe e will determine placement of the student in the curriculum and if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the medical education curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on licensing exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. 6.8.10 Med ical Withdrawal (Absence Greater than 180 Calendar Days) A Medical Withdrawal may be granted to students who are in good academic standing and who have an approved medical reason for a medical leave of absence that exceeds 180 calendar days. A student returning from an approved Medical Withdrawal minimally must submit a completed Secondary Application, Background Check, and Controlled Substance Screen within a timeframe designated by CUSOM, but no later than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the anticipated return date. Additional requirements, such as a medical or psychiatric evaluation, may be placed on returning students as deemed appropriate. In order to return from an approved Medical Withdrawal, the student must also provide the Dean with documentation from a physician approving/releasing the student to return as a full -time student in the curriculum. Once approved for return, the APPS Committee will determine placement of a student who has taken an approved medical leave to determine where the 208 student will resume the curriculum and if any additional action or supplementary educational curriculum is required. Recommendations will be based on the requisite knowledge skills and abilities required to resume a specific point in the curriculum coupled with a focus on ensuring the appropriate continuum of the medical education curriculum and training required to be successful, perform well on licensing exams, and provide competent and compassionate patient care. Students who do not return on the approved da te, or otherwise do not fulfill all of the requirements for return, will need to re -apply through AACOMAS and will not be guaranteed re -admission. 6.8.11 Suspension Suspension is defined as a temporary separation from the institution and during this period students are enrolled, not registered and are not eligible for financial aid . The duration of the Suspension will be determined by the Dean and may include recomme ndations from the APPS Committee. While on Suspension, students must not represent themselves as CUSOM students. In addition, they may not be on the University campus or affiliated clinical campuses, participate in any clinical activities or wear their C USOM white coat. Students on Suspension are not eligible to Withdraw. If the terms set out under the Suspension are not fulfilled, or the period of Suspension is greater than 180 calendar days, the student will be dismissed from CUSOM. 6.8.12 Dismissal Dismissal from CUSOM is based upon recommendations made by the APPS Committee, with final approval for dismissal by the Dean. 6.9 Graduation 6.9.1 Graduation Requirements The degree of Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine is granted to, and conferred upon, candidates who: Have satisfied all academic requirements, and completed the total number of credits required for their class as calculated at the time of graduation; Have passed COMLEX -USA Level 1, COMLEX -USA Level 2 -PE; 209 Have demonstrated good moral, professional, and ethical character; Completed all required exit paperwork and settled all financial obligations with CUSOM, Campbell University and affiliate and collaborative partners incurred during the academic program. In accordance with COCA standards, single degree DO students must complete their education within six (6) years following matriculation. T o become eligible for graduation, each student must successfully complete all the above requirements within six (6) year s following matriculation. The six (6) years allow for the completion of a Modified Course of Study due to medical, academic, behavioral or other leave of absence. The Dean may, in exceptional circumstances, grant an extension to this 6 -year rule. Profe ssional and ethical competence is required for graduation. Students must demonstrate the ethical and professional qualities deemed necessary for success and continued study and practice of osteopathic medicine; the suitability for the practice of medicine by dutiful and responsible acceptance for patient care; and integrity in the conduct of clinical duties. Students may be dismissed from CUSOM if any of these competencies are not met. In addition, revocation of the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree may occur following graduation for discovered misconduct of prior students. Allegations of misconduct, which may result in a revocation of a granted degree, are considered by the Dean. A student must complete all curricular requirements at CUSOM, or a min imum of two (2) years at CUSOM and another institution accredited by the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) or Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), between the date of matriculation and graduation. In addition to this require ment, the student must have been enrolled full -time at CUSOM during their third and fourth academic years. A CUSOM student must complete to the satisfaction of the faculty, as determined by the individual course directors, clinical rotation preceptors and through the APPS Committee, all prescribed courses and clinical experiences to graduate. The Dean makes the determination on any student appeals of APPS Committee or Vice Dean recommendations, based solely upon new and meaningful information not availabl e to the APPS Committee or Vice Dean at the time of the initial hearing and deliberation. Students must meet with the Assistant Director of Financial Aid and Registrar to complete all required exit documentation in order to receive a diploma. CUSOM stude nts must also attend the exit process and commencement program in order to receive a diploma. 210 Upon passage of COMLEX -USA Level 1, Level 2 -CE, Level 2 -PE, and all other requirements as delineated in this Academic Bulletin, the Faculty of CUSOM, through the Dean and President, recommends degree candidates to the Board of Trustees. Upon approval of the recommendation, the Board of Trustees confers the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree on students successfully completing all requirements for graduation. 6.9.2 Delayed Graduation Policy If a student is suspended, takes a Leave of Absence, or is required to retake courses in the curriculum as a result of specific course or clinical rotation failures or a deficiency in overall academic performance, the stude nt will be placed in a Modified Course of Study (MCOS). As discussed in Section 6.6.3, a Modified Course of Study (MCOS) is a credit -bearing, individualized study plan for students who require an alternative educational pathway for reasons such as board preparation, required remediation, illness, leaves of absence, or withdrawals. The institution of a MCOS will result in a delay in the scheduling and completion of a student's clinical rotations and graduation date. Voluntary course withdrawals, temporary leaves of absence, suspensions secondary to academic or non- academic matters, or failure to pass Board exams consistent with CUSOM policy may also result in a delay in the scheduling and completion of a student's clinical rota tions and graduation date. For students to be eligible to participate in, but will not receive a diploma at, the May graduation ceremony, they must have taken COMLEX USA Level 2- CE and Level 2 -PE prior to graduation with the results available no later tha n six (6) weeks following graduation. Any alteration in the normal curriculum progression may affect a student's financial aid status or qualification for education- based financial aid. In addition, placement in a Modified Course of Study may impact the student's ability to participate in the residency match process. Specific counseling and advice should be sought from the CUSOM Office of Academic Affairs and the University's Office of Financial Aid for these or other indicated situations. For Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine candidates who have grade point average of 2.000 or higher but who are lacking no more than thirty (30) credit hours of meeting all graduation requirements may file a \"Request to Participate in Commencement.\" Forms for this purpose a re available in the Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine Registrar's Office. Candidates applying for the \"thirty (30) hour rule\" exemption must also file an Application for Graduation. If approved, the candidate will be allowed to participa te in only one Commencement program for the degree in question. Furthermore, the candidate must understand that if approved for the participation in May or December Commencement, he/she will not be eligible to participate in any subsequent semester when he/she would have been eligible after having met all graduation requirements. Candidates participating under the \"thirty (30) hour 211 rule\" will not receive graduation honors until all requirements have been met and they have filed a new Application for Graduation for the term in which the degree will actually be conferred. 6.9.3 Hooding Policy This policy outlines the requirements for an individual to be allowed to hood CUSOM graduates conferred with the degree Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine. The Dean designates the specific hooders to participate in each Commencement ceremony. This includes participating immediate family members who may be approved to serve as a hooder as discussed below. All hooders of graduates receiving the Doctor of Osteopathic M edicine (DO) degree must be CUSOM Faculty or hold either the DO or Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree from an accredited medical school. Members of the graduation ceremony platform party who do not hold the DO or MD degree may be permitted to hood graduates upon approval by the Dean. Immediate family members who hold either the DO or MD degree from an accredited medical school may be permitted to hood graduates upon approval by the Dean. For the purposes of this Policy, an immediate family member is defined as a person who is connected to the graduate by blood or marriage -- spouse, parent(s), parent -in-law, brother, sister, son, daughter, grandparent(s), aunt, uncle, cousin, nephew, niece, or sibling -in-law. Family hooders are required to wear appropriate academic regalia during the Commencement ceremony. Family hooders who do not own their own regalia are responsible for any costs associated with the rental/purchase of regalia for the ceremony. Students who participate in Commencement ceremonies outside of the CUSOM Commencement Ceremony in May will not be able to designate specific hooders for their Commencement ceremony (i.e., no family hooders at any graduation other than the May ceremony). 212 6.10 Student Conduct 6.10.1 Student Conduct All CUSOM students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner at all times. Establishing and maintaining the highest concepts of honor and personal integrity during medical school is critical to the training of physicians. It is the responsibility of the student to support the standards of student conduct and it is reasonable to expect this of all students attending CUSOM. All CUSOM students have the rights and obligations of other citizens and measure the urgency of these obliga tions in the light of responsibilities to colleagues, to their profession, and to the institution. When CUSOM students speak or act as private citizens, they must avoid creating the impression of speaking or acting for their School or the University. As such, they should not identify themselves as CUSOM students when posting comments or material on websites, social media, or other forms of communication without the express permission of the Dean. As citizens engaged in a profession which depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, students have a particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom. Student Statement of Professional Ethics As a CUSOM stude nt, I will... Be guided by a deep c onviction of the w orth and dignity of all human life; Pursue the a dvancem ent of knowl edge and recognize the special responsibilitie s placed u pon m e; Adhere to the policies and procedures of CUSOM in all matters; Seek and communicate truth; Promote scholarly compe tence and integrity; Practice intellectual honesty; Uphold scholarly and ethical st andards; Demonstrate respect for peers, faculty, staff, administration and the community in general; Foster hone st acade mic conduc t and ensure student evaluations reflect the stude nt's true merit; Promote appropriate interaction between students and facul ty, stude nts and administr ation, and students and st aff; Avoid any exploitation, harassment, or discriminatory treatment; Respect and defend the free inqui ry of associates' exchange of ideas and sh ow respect for the opinions of others; Give due regard to the paramount responsibilitie s within the institution in de termining the amount and character of work done outside it. 213 Respect for Patients CUSOM takes the utmost care to ensure patient respect and confidentiality. As osteopathic medical students, students must demonstrate respect for patients through appropriate language and behavior, including that which is non-threatening and non- judgment al. This respect extends to interactions with standardized patients, including simulated patients, during all OSCE, clinical skills, OMM, a nd simulation experiences/labs. In order to maintain professional relationships with patients and their families, patient privacy and modesty will be respected during history taking, physical examinations, and any other contact. It is critical for students to be truthful and not intenti onally mislead or give false information. Students should avoid disclosing information to a patient which only the patient's physician should reveal. Students should always, or at the request of the patient, consult more experienced members of the medical team regarding patient care. Respect for Faculty, Staff, Colleagues, Hospital Personnel, and Community Students will respect faculty, staff, colleagues, and others, including hospital personnel, guests, and members of the general public. This respect should be demonstrated by punctuality in relationships with patients and peers, prompt execution of reasonable instructions, and deference to those with superior knowledge, experience or capabilities. Students should express views in a calm and respectful manner when in disagreement with another individual, understanding that a mutual agreement will not always be reached. Respect for Self All students should uphold a high level of personal ethics, beliefs, and morals in their daily conduct. Respect for Laws, Policies and Regulations Students must respect and obey the laws, policies, and regulations at all levels of the University and the local community, state and federal government. 6.10.2 Chaperon ed Physical E xam Policy Purpose The purpose of this policy is to define the need for, and usage of, chaperones in patient care, simulation, and teaching environments of Campbell University and its affiliated sites. 214 Patient/learner trust cannot be maintained without a basic understanding of the limits and re sponsibilities of the professional's role. The valued human experience of the physician -patient relationship is damaged when there is either confusion regarding professional roles and behavior or clear lack of integrity that allows sexual exploitation and harm. Sexual impropriety may comprise behavior, gestures, or expressions that are seductive, sexually suggestive, disrespectful of patient privacy, or sexually demeaning to a patient, that may include, but are not limited to: 1. Neglecting to employ appropriate disrobing or draping practices respecting the patient's privacy, or deliberately watching a patient dress or undress; 2. Subjecting a patient to an intimate examination in the presence of medi cal students or other parties without the p atient's informed consent or in the e vent such infor med consent has been withdr awn; 3. Examination or touching of genital muco sal areas without the use of gloves; 4. Inapp ropriate comments about or to the patient, including but not limited to, making s exual comments about a patient's body or unde rclothing, making s exualized or sexually demeaning comments to a patient, criticiz ing the p atient's sexual orientation, or making comments about potential sexual performance during an examination; 5. Using the physician-patient relationship to solicit a date or romantic relationship; 6. Initiation by the physician of conversation regarding the sexual probl ems, pr eferences, or f antasi es of the physician; 7. Performi ng an intimate examination or consultation without clinical justification; 8. Performi ng an intimate examination or consultat ion without explaining to the pa tient the need for such examination or consultation even when the e xamination or consultation is pertinent to the issue of s exual function or dysfunction; and/or 9. Requesting details of sexual history or sexual likes or dislikes when not c linically indicated for the type of examination or consultation. Policy Medical students at any level of training are held to the same ethical standards as established by the medical profession. Efforts to provide a comfortable and considerate atmosphere for the patient and t he learner are part of respecting patients' dignity. These efforts may include, but are not limited to, providing appropriate gowns, private facilities for undre ssing, sensitive use of draping, and clearly explaining various components of the physical examination. Having chaperones present during the physical exam can also help prevent misunderstandings between patient and learner or health care provider. 215 CUSOM students and facul ty should: 1. Adhere to a policy that patients are free to request a chaperone during the medi cal encounter and ensure that the policy is clearly communicated to pa tients. 2. Alwa ys honor a patient's request to have a chaperone. 3. Never perform invasive or sensitive exams such as breast, pelvic, rectal, and genitourin ary exams without the p resence of an authori zed chaperone. 4. Have an authori zed memb er of the health care team serve as a chaperone. Physicians should establis h clear expectations that chaperones will uphold profe ssional standards of privacy and confide ntiality. 5. Use a chaperone even when a patient's trusted companion or family memb er is pre sent. 6. Provide oppor tunity for private conversation with the patient without the chaperone present. Physicians should minimize inqui ries or history taki ng of a sensitive n ature during a chaperoned examination. 7. Have chaperones available regardless of the ph ysician's gender. 8. Inform the patient that an appropr iate staff member can act as a chaperone if required and where possible this will be a staff member of the same gender as the patient. 9. Respect that the patient has the right, at all times, to decline a particular p erson a s chaperone. 10. Utilize the learning or simulation environme nt in a mann er consistent with r especting patient pri vacy. 11. Utilize same gender models for sensitive physical exam demonstr ations whe never possible (cardiac exam, sa cral exam, etc...). 12. Perform Osteopathic Manual Manipul ation (OMM) only on subjects or patients who are adequately clothed to cove r all sensitive areas. 13. Not p erform O MM as an invasive procedure. 14. Respect the right of a patient participating in an educat ional activity (such as, but not limited to OMM lab, ultrasound lab, clinical skills) to refuse any component of the ph ysical exam. 15. Respect the right of a child volunt eer in the OMM or Clinical Skills lab to refuse any component of a physical exam, even if approva l to perform the exam has been given by the parent. Children participating in OMM or Cl inical Skills labs must never be forceful ly subjected to any physical exam, even if the exam is not c onside red sensitive in na ture. Family members or friends of the patient should not be expected to undertake any formal chaperone role. There is a risk of inadvertent breaches of confidentiality and embarrassment if friends or relatives are chaperones, 216 and they are best avoided unless t here is no alternative than postponing an immediately necessary physical examination. There is also the possibility of collusion between the patient and friend/relative/caregiver to conspire where any complaint of abuse is made. Medical students must not conduct any intimate examination unsupervised even if the patient provides permission for them to proceed with the examination without a chaperone. Medical students cannot act as a chaperone to their clinical partner (another medical student) or another health care provider for intimate examinations. It is important that students seek verbal consent from patients for any form of examination. For intimate examinations, informed consent is particularly important. Intimate examinations include the followin g: Vaginal e xamination Rectal e xamination External genitalia examination Breast examination Any other examination that might embarrass patients throug h the removal of clothes, particularly those examinations that might expose external genitalia or breasts Procedur e Communicate the chaperone protocol to patients by prominent notice through conversation with the patient. Honor all requests for a chaperone. Utilize private facilities for undressing, incorporate sensitive use of draping, and provide clear explanations on the various components of the physical examination to be performed. o The nature of the proced ure/examination should be explain ed o The purpose of the procedure/examination should be clearly stated, (e.g. \"it is t o help me learn how to...\") o There should be an explanation, where relevant, of what will happen to the information collected (e.g., \"I will record my finding s in the medi cal notes... \") o The patient's understanding , and acceptance, of the procedure/examination should be assessed and documented Utilize chaperones on a consistent ba sis, particularly for intimate examinations and those that may be constr ued as such regardless of physician or learner's gender. When a chaperone is present, keep patient inqui ries of a sensitive nature to a minimum. Provide a separate oppor tunity for a private conve rsation be tween the patient and the physician, in order to protect the patient's p ersonal health infor mation (PHI). 217 Provide an authori zed health prof essional to serve as the chaperone whenever possibl e. During a rectal/vaginal examination, sur gical gloves mu st be worn. Glov es act as a barrier and thus h elp to maintain the clinical natu re of the exam. Throughout the examination the healthcare professional must remain alert to verbal and non- verbal indications of dis tress from the patient. Any request for the examination to be discontinue d should be respected and doc ument ed in t he patients records. Any discussion during the examination should be kept relevant avoidi ng any unne cessa ry personal comments regardless of whether a chaperone is present. A person who is feeling embarrassed or vulne rable is more likely to m isinterpret a comment. Document in t he patient not e or c hart the presence of a chaperone with a ny intimate examination or those that ma y be constr ued as such. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) offers the following additional guidance on the use of chaperones for children and adoles cents: In the medic al office setting, the physical examination of an infant, toddl er, or child should always be performed in the presence of a parent or guardian. If a parent or guardian is unavailable or the parent's presence will interfere with the p hysical examination, such as in a possible case of abuse or pa rental ment al health issues, a chaperone shou ld be present during the p hysical examination. Cons equences of non-compliance Items of potential non -compliance are of serious concern and will require confirmation via investigation of any allegation. Due to the sensitive nature of the grievance, CUSOM will require that all real and standardized patient interactions involving the accused be immediately suspended at the time of the grievance, pending the investigation conclusion. As outlined in the Academic Bulletin, the APPS Committee is responsible for the review of situations where students are involved in academic misconduct, or unprofessional conduct. The CUSOM Honor Code will guide this review. Outcomes of an APPS C ommittee intervention may include, but are not limited to, any of the following levels of discipline: Disciplinary Probation Suspension Withdrawal Dismissal from the program w ithou t the option to return Revocation of De gree 218 Violations of patient rights are serious matte rs and may result in crimin al charges. FERPA privacy laws do not protect violations of a crimin al natu re. Concl usions regar ding fitness to p ractice and treatment if appr opriate. According to the recommendations made by the Federation of State Medical Boards, Campbell University supports the loss of enrollment into the school, as well as revocation of degree upon confirmed misconduct. 6.10.3 Honor Code The Campbell University Jerry M. Wallace School of Osteopathic Medicine Honor Code of Conduct (CUSOM Honor Code) embodies a spirit of mutual trust, intellectual honesty, and professionalism between the School and the student body, and it is the highest expression of the values shared by the CUSOM and Campbell University communities. The CUSOM Honor Code is based on the fundamental belief that every student is wor thy of trust and it is maintained to protect the right to participate in an academic environment free from injustice caused by dishonesty. Further, CUSOM students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional and ethical manner befitting the honora ble profession they are entering. Students have an obligation to maintain the highest standards of honesty and integrity. It is not possible to enumerate all examples of expected academic and professional behavior, nor is it possible to enumerate all behaviors considered inappropriate, unprofessional, unethical, or not in keeping with the standards of a CUSOM student. The following serves only as a guideline to students. In general, the founding principles of the CUSOM Honor Code are the established rul es and regulations of the CUSOM community. The CUSOM community includes CUSOM, affiliated hospitals, and any institution where CUSOM students pursue activities for academic credit. Violation of these rules and regulations may constitute a violation of th e CUSOM Honor Code. In addition, specific examples of behavior which may constitute a violation of the CUSOM Honor Code include, but are not limited to, the following: Cheating: Providing , acquiring or receiving any unauthori zed assistance or unfair advantage on any form of academic work, or attempt thereof. Sharing inf ormation f rom testing/exams is also conside red a form of cheating. Plagiarism: Copying the language, structure, ideas, algorithms, or comput er code of another and representing it as one's own work on any form of academic work or attempt thereof. Falsification: Fabrication of in formation on a ny form of academic work or attempt the reof; including, but not limited to, the f ollowin g: o Clinical requirements 219 o Externships and clinical rotations o Assignments such a s: obt aining patient hi stories, performi ng physical exams, orde ring or int erpreting laboratory tests, documenting a nd submi tting rotation records, etc... o CUSOM lab, skills workshop, small group session, and clinical rotation attendance reports o Clinical preceptor or other faculty evaluation or grading forms Disruptive Behavior : Any inapp ropriate etiquette or inappr opriate disturbance either solely or repeated often enough oft en enough to establis h a disrespectful trend. Inappropri ate disturbances include but are not l imited to t he following: o Arriving late for class, lab, or clinical rotations o Disrupting class with cellular phone s o Disrupting class with c omput ers or c omput er games o Disrupting class with loud talking or other activities which create a distraction o Leaving trash in classrooms or academic areas, including student small g roup stu dy room s o Bringing food into unauthori zed areas or hosting food functions without pe rmissio n o Posting una pprove d materials or a pprove d mat erials in inappr opriate areas o Parking in inappropriate or reserved spa ces Unacceptable use of technolog y: Any violation of the acceptable use guidelines as publ ished by the CU SOM IT department or as noted in the Campbell University Technology Usage Policy: https://www.campbell.edu/information -technology - services/acceptable- use-policy/ In addition, unaccept able uses of technolog y include, but are not limited to, the following: o Using compute rs for pur poses which are conside red unprofessional or i mmoral o Accessi ng pornographic material at any time while on any campus of the CUSOM community or using any equipm ent of the CUSOM community to acc ess such m aterial o Distributing, posting, or uploading materials to students or any other third party not authorized to receive them or to those outside CUSOM is an Honor Code violation. Lecture materials, includi ng PowerPoint presentations, and videos contain confide ntial and proprietary info rmation and material protected by intellectual p roperty laws. Students do not ha ve permission to sha re them. o Any device capable of capturing still or video images or audio recordings, including cell phones, are not permitted in any 220 laboratory (anatomy, clinical skills, OMM, Simulation), or in any clinical setting, including and not limited to OSCE, standardized patients, clinical rotations, and the student health clinic. Unprofessional or unethical behavior : Behavior on or off the CUSOM campus that would or could cause a loss of respect or confidence in the offending student or in the CUSOM community by the public, faculty, staff, colleagues, or the-communi ty-at-large. Unprofessional or unethical behavior may include, but is not limited to, the following: Entering or using the facilities of the CUS OM community without appropri ate authori zation or during inappropri ate times. Knowingly and purpos ely disrupt ing teaching, research, administrative, or student func tions of the CUSOM community. Abusive or disrespectful conduc t toward members of the faculty, administrative or pro fessional staff, employees, students, patients, or visitors of the CUSOM communi ty. Medical simulators should be treated with the same level of respect and professionalism as standardized or actual patients Disclosure of privil eged information from campus activities or patient care. Taking pictures or recording video in the anatomy lab, clinical lab, OSCE rooms, or in any rooms housing clinical simulators. Impro per relationships or activities invol ving persons entrusted to a student as part of educational requirements, which extend beyond those educational requirements. Entrusted persons may inclu de, but are not limited to, patients or othe r stud ents unde r supervisio n. Controlled substance screening tests which show abnormalities including, but not limited, to excessively dilute urine, or screening tests which are positive (i.e., evidence of the substance or showing presence) for alcohol, prescription medicat ions without a valid prescription, or substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina. Controlled substance screening results are viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal substances. For example, although the use o f marijuana is legal in some states, the US Federal Drug Enforcement Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to patients . o As such, the use of marijuana in any form is a violation of University pol icy. Anothe r example is a breathalyzer result or a blood alcohol concentr ation sample identi fying lev els of alcohol above the legal limit in violation of law, such as in a Driving Und er the Influence (DUI), Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), or a similar charge. The presence of these subs tances, regardless of any legal conside rations or adjudi cation by the 221 courts, is c onside red unp rofessional or u nethical behavior by CUSOM. Breach of Integrity: Any behavior at any time that is conside red a severe lapse in judgment and has the potential to damage the professional, ethical or moral integrity of the CUSOM community. A violation of any policy of the Univ ersity or CUSOM, including but not limited to the A merican Osteopathic Asso ciation Code of E thics. Section 6.7.5 of this Bulletin, \"Academic Performance, Promotion and Standards (APPS) Committee; Ad hoc Committee Procedures\", describes the process for addressing cases related to allegations of misconduct or professionalism and/or Honor Code violations. In such cases, the Executive Director of Student Affairs or respective Associate Dean, notifies the As sociate Dean for Clinical Integration of the suspected violation and provides him/her with a detailed summary of the reason for referral along with all supporting documentation. The Associate Dean for Clinical Integration then, (i) constitutes an ad hoc committee to investigate the suspected misconduct, who reports their findings in writing to the Vice Dean for Academic Affairs, or (ii) depending upon the severity of the allegations, refers the matter directly to the APPS Committee. 6.10.4 Code of Misconduct Violations may include , but are not limited to: Harassment (other than a violation of the Title IX Policy), harm, a buse, or damage to any person or prope rty in the CUSOM community. This include s know ingly or purp osely ng damage to or va CUSOM c ommunity proper ty. Arrest for a crimin al offense othe r than a minor traffic offense. Participating in academic or clinical endeav ors in the CUSOM community while unde r the influ ence of alcohol, or c ontroll ed substances. Use, possession, or distribution of alcohol, illicit subst ances, prescription me dications without a valid prescription, or substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolina may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismiss al. Controll ed substances will be viewed in light of North Carolina and federal laws governing illegal substances. Please note this include s substances which are illegal in the state of N orth Ca rolina, but which m ay be legal in other states. Com municating or posting of information or images in a public arena, including w ritten or electroni c/Internet communications, which could result in a loss of re spect by patients or other memb ers of the public toward the offending student or tow ard CUSO M. 222 Release of Information All documents and other information concerning student discipline, inclu ding w ritten reprim ands, are securely maintain ed in a confid ential file. Such actions become a part of the student 's permanent educat ion record but are only released at the written disc retion of the D ean. Ho wever, all disciplinary actions, with the exception of A dmonitions and Academic Warnings , are required to be reported o n the M edical Student Performance Evaluation (M SPE). 6.10.5 Grievance Processes Resolution and Grievance Proced ure CUSOM recognizes the need for students to voice grievances and to seek resolution to problems, disagreements with faculty/administrators, or interpretations of institutional policy. CUSOM also recognizes the responsibility of the student to express their concer ns in a professional and ethical manner. Concerns may involve course grades other than a grade reviewed by the APPS Committee, promotion, behavioral issues, financial concerns or issues related to external (e.g. COCA, SACSCOC) accreditation standards and procedures. This grievance process shall not be used to appeal or review violations of the Honor Code or an appeal from the APPS Committee final decision by the Dean or the APPS Committee. All grievances must be filed in writing to the CUSOM Office of the Dean. All grievance material is securely maintained in the Dean's Office in a specific student/employee/faculty file as appropriate to the grievance. Each step of the Resolution and Grievance Procedure generally takes fourteen (14) calendar days to c omplete, unless otherwise noted. Extensions or waivers to this timeframe may be granted on a case -by-case basis. Notice of a request for an extension from a student must be submitted in writing to the Dean within ten (10) calendar days prior to the deadl ine. Decisions regarding the request for an extension shall be communicated to the student via letter within two (2) business days of receipt of the request for an extension. Likewise, if CUSOM needs to extend a deadline, the Office of the Dean shall pro vide said notice ten (10) calendar days before the due date. Grievance for Academic Re solutions and Appeals An individual concern of an academic nature should be first discussed with the immediate instructor or preceptor and must be done in a professional manner. This concern generally includes those which arise from personal conflicts or actions taken against a student individually. For individual 223 concerns, if resolution cannot be reached, the student may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal, in writing to the appropriate Associate Dean for the academic year involved. If resolution cannot be reached from the prior appeals, the student may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the Dean whose decision will constitute the final resolution. The Dean may refuse to meet with a student if the appeal has not been pres ented in writing, in advance of the meeting. A concern over general course procedures or grading policies should be addressed through the Class President through the Curriculum Committee. If a resolution cannot be reached through the normal processes for an acceptable and reasonable request, the Class President may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the appropriate Associate Dean for the academic year involved. If resolution cannot be reached from the prior appeals, the Class President may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the Dean whose decision will constitute the final resolution. The Dean may refuse to meet with the Class President if the appeal has not b een presented in writing, in advance of the meeting. Reminder : Course Assessment policies and test question challenges are not covered under student grievances. See course- specific syllabi for information regarding these issues. A concern over CUSOM policies and procedures should be addressed through the SGA President and the Executive Director of Student Affairs . If through the normal processes for an acceptable and reasonable request, a resolution cannot be reached, the SGA President may, within fourteen (14) calendar days of the failed resolution, appeal in writing to the Dean whose decision will constitute the final resolution. The Dean may refuse to meet with the SGA President if the appeal has not been presented in writing, in advance of the meeting. If the concern is financial, or with other areas of CUSOM, the student should follow the appropriate chain of command as defined by the CUSOM Organizational Chart. Grievance Proced ure for Harassment or Discrimination Students who feel they are being discriminated against have the right to exercise the Grievance Procedure. Retaliation against any individual who files a grievance or participates in the grievance process is strictly prohibited. In the event a student or anyone 224 who participated in the grievance process believes they have been subjected to retaliation, that individual may use the Harassment Grievance procedures listed below. Step One: The Resolution Process Students who meet the Technical Standards for admission to CUSOM, as described in this Academic Bulletin, and feel they are being discriminated against shall first meet with the Executive Director of Student Affairs to explain their grievance. The student must schedule a meeting with the Executive Director of Student Affairs within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of the action being grieved or the date the student should have known about the action to initiate this discussion. The grievance complaint must be made in writing and signed by the person filing it. The Executive Director of Student Affairs shall in vestigate the grievance within seven (7) calendar days . In the case where the discrimination is in any way threatening, the Executive Director of Student Affairs shall investigate the complaint and bring it to the attention of the Dean immediately for intervention. After the investigation period of seven (7) calendar days , the student filing the grievance, and the person against whom the grievance is filed shall meet with the Executive Director of Student Affairs to discuss an informal resolution. This meeting shall be scheduled within fourteen (14) calendar days of the initial filing of the grievance. A letter confirming the mutual de cisions of the resolution shall be distributed, within ten (10) calendar days of the meeting, to all persons and kept within the permanent student and or employee files for possible future issues that may arise with the resolution. If the Executive Direct or of Student Affairs determines there is insufficient evidence to support the allegations, he/she may close the grievance and shall notify the student, within fourteen (14) calendar days, of his/her findings and inform the student of their right to reques t a grievance hearing. The Executive Director of Student Affairs shall keep a record of the grievance investigation, including all supporting documentation and a report of the findings. All material shall be filed as previously stated in this procedure. Step Two: The Grievance Hearing Process If the student feels the informal resolution has not been successful, or disagrees with the informal resolution, he/she may request the Executive Director of Student Affairs and the Dean to call a Grievance Hearing. 225 The student has thirty (30) calendar days after receiving written notice of denial of the grievance to request such a hearing. The request must be in writing, signed by the student, and include the following inf ormation: A clear and precise stat ement of the g rievance; A statement explaining how the action is discrimin atory or the decision unr easonable if it i s a denial of a requested accom modatio n; The n ame the r esponde nt pa rties (the p erson(s)) against whom the g rievance is filed); An explanation of each responde nt respons ible for the action or decision; The requested re medy; and Any request to bring a non-participating observer to the heari ng.

Neither party shall be entitled to have an attorney represent them at the hearing. Only the Chair shall be entitled to question any witness, and decide upon the relevancy of any evidence presented. Prior to convening the grievance hearing meeting, the Grievance Hearing Board shall be trained on the specific grievance hearing procedures relating to the individual grievance and will be provided with additional educational material as appropriate. Following this initial hearing and presentation, if additional information is needed to render a decision, the Grievance Hearing Board may recess for a period of not greater than fou rteen (14) calendar days. The Grievance Hearing Board, or the Executive Director of Student Affairs at the request of the Grievance Hearing Board, shall conduct further investigation of the alleged grievances. The Grievance Hearing Board may, during this time, meet with CUSOM's legal counsel who has further expertise in the law regarding disability and discrimination. The second meeting of the Grievance Hearing Board, which shall occur within fourteen (14) calendar days, shall be to further discuss the grievance, the investigation, the educational materials provided, and the advice of legal counsel. The Grievance Hearing Board may require second interviews with the person filing the grievance or with those whom the grievance is filed against. The Grievance Hearing Board shall make a final ruling at this meeting. Minutes will be taken of all Grievanc e Hearing Board meetings. A letter shall be sent to the student within fourteen (14) calendar days of the final determination by the Grievance Hearing Board. Step Three: Final Appeal Procedur e The parties have the right to appeal the decision of the Grievance Hearing Board to the Dean.

All students must provide written documentation utilizing the AAMC Standardized Immunization Form, completed and signed by their health care provider or institutional representative, verifying that all CUSOM immunization and titer requirements listed below , in accordance with the CDC Guidelines (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/rec -vac/hcw.html ) have been met : Diphthe ria, Per tussis and Tetanus o All s tudents m ust submit document ation (physician signature or vaccinatio n record) of i mmuniz ation with a *Tda p boost er (Boostrix\u00ae or Adacel\u00ae) since t he year 20 05. o Following the T dap boos ter, proof of a Td r outine boost er is required every ten (10) years TB test (prior to matriculation and again prior to each year of c linical rotations) o There are two acceptable methods for TB screening and all students m ust provide document ation of the results from O NE of the two methods: A two -step tube rculin (IGRAs ) blood TB test mu st be obt ained w ithin six (6) m onths of m atriculation Hepatitis B virus (quantitative titer) o Students must provide da tes and ve rification (vaccination r ecord) of compl eting a Hepatitis B vaccination s eries consist ing of three (3) hepatitis B in jections o In addition, ve rification of quantitative demonstr ating immuni ty to hepa titis B must be provided Students who do not sho w im munity followi ng the vaccination series should r efer to the Immunization Pol icy for further steps MMR: Measles (Rube ola), Mumps and Rube lla o Students must provide da tes and ve rification (vaccination r ecord) of two (2) M MR vaccinations, oc curring at least 28 da ys apart If the stude nt is able to pr ovide a n immuniz ation record or physician si gnature verifying the d ates of these two ( 2) vaccinations, no titer will be required o Students una ble to pr ovide im munization records or physician signature verifying compl etion of the MMR series have two ( 2) options: Repeat t he MMR series of two ( 2) vaccinations a t least 2 8 days apart and provide document ation verifying compl etion of the series Obtain asles, mumps, and rubella Varicella the time of matriculation) Influenza vaccin ation every year In some situations, clinical sites may have additional immunization requirements above those required by CUSOM. CUSOM does not waive immunization or student health requirements for religious, medical or personal preferences. CUSOM may revise the immunization requirements at any time as deemed necessary, and all students will be required to comply with subsequent changes. 233 7.1.4 Controlled Substance Screening Protocol Controll ed substance screeni ng of learners and sta ff memb ers is mandatory at most healthcare facilities prior to participating in patient care. As such, a controll ed substance screeni ng test showing no evidence of alcohol, illicit substa nces, prescription me dications without a valid pr escription, or substances, which are illegal in the state of No rth Carolin a, is required before matriculation into CUSOM, and again before the start of Year Three of the program . Addit ional screening or confirmato ry tests may be required as deter mined by CUSOM or the clinical training sites. CUSOM reserves the right to require controll ed substance testing or a psychiatric evaluation on any student whe n there is an incident of erratic or unusu al behavior, or there is a reason able concern due to a stude nt's b ehavior, appear ance or pe rformance. Refusal or failure to submit to testing may result in disciplina ry action up to, and includin g, dismissal from the program. Students found to have screening tests posit ive for alcohol, illicit substances, and control led substances (define d as a drug or substance that is listed in Schedules I through V of the Federal Controll ed Substances A ct (21 U.S.C. \u00a7812) ) or prescription medi cations without a valid prescription may be subject to disciplina ry action up to, and including , dismissal. Please note this also include s substances which are illegal in the state of North Carolin a, but which m ay be legal in other states. For examp le, althoug h the use of m arijuana is legal in some states, the US Federa l Drug En forceme nt Agency lists it as an illegal drug. Its use or abuse impairs the ability of a healthcare professional to provide optimal care to his or her patients. As such, the use of ma rijuana in any form is a violation of University policy. CUSOM will provide clinical rotation sites with a copy of the results of any controll ed subs tance screening performed on studen ts prior to, and for the duration of, their placem ent at the site. By matriculating at CUSOM, studen ts grant CUSOM the right to share this information as deem ed appropriate. Clinica l education sites may set their own standards in regards to who they will permit to participate in clinical rotations ba sed on the results of the substa nce abuse screeni ng or require students undergo further testing. CUSOM has no control over the content of third- party background checks, which may include charges of Driving Under the Influence (DUI), Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), or similar offenses . Even expunged records may appear on these checks. Backg round checks revealing prior crimin al activity, even charges which may have been dismissed by the courts, could still result in consequences affecting clinical rotations, accepta nce into residen cy programs, future licensin g, specialty board ce rtification, or employment oppor tunities. 234 If a student is unable to complete clinical rotations due to the inabil ity to pass controlled substance testing re quirements, they will not be capable of making academic progress or be able to meet graduation requirements . In addition, and as such, the y will be referred to t he APPS Committee for possible sanctions, up to, and including, dis missal from the program . Prior to starting Year 3: Students must have the controll ed substance screening sample collected at a facility approve d by CUSOM. If the test result is posit ive or shows other abnormalities, such as but not limited to exce ssively dilute urine , the Dean will appoint an ad hoc subcommittee, a subset of the CUSOM AP PS Com mittee, to review the information and make a r ecommendation to the D ean regarding the appropriate action. Depending on the decision, the student's advancement to the third year of the curriculum (c linical rotations) may be delayed based on the results. Results of controll ed substance screeni ngs are made available to clinical rotation sites. By matriculating at CUSOM, studen ts grant CUSOM the right to share this information a s deem ed appropriate. All controll ed subs tance screening tests are maintain ed in a secure location to ensure confidentiality. A ccess to this information is limited to the Executive Director of Student Affairs , the Associ ate D ean for Cl inical Affairs, the CUSOM Dean (or Vi ce Dean as the Dean's designee), and the Campbell Univ ersity General Couns el. Results from posit ive controll ed substance screen s are shared with the Director of Behavioral Health in t he event the student r equires dru g/alcohol couns eling. The entire cost of an y testing is the respons ibility of the student. If a student is unable to complete clinical rotations due to the inabil ity to pass controlled substance testing re quirements, they will not be capable of making academic progress or be able to meet graduation requirements . In addition, and as such, the y will be referred to t he APPS Committee for possible sanctions, up to, a nd including, dis missal from the program . 7.1.5 Infection Control Students exposed to infectious diseases should consult the Campbell University's Health Center (910) 893- 1560 for information regarding appropriate evaluation, testing or treatment. Students presenting with signs or symptoms of infectio us or communicable disease should consult with Campbell University's Health Center or the infection control office at the clinical site to determine if it is safe for them to continue providing care, and if not, when it is safe to resume. 235 Standard Precautions The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has developed precautions to prevent accidental spread of infectious disease in healthcare settings. These include standard precautions for all patient care and transmission- based precautions for situations in w hich specific infections are identified or suspected. A comprehensive description of these precautions are found on the CDC website at: https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/basics/index.html Standard precautions make use of common- sense practices and personal protective equipment to protect healthcare providers from infection and prevent the spread of infection from patient to patient; examples include, but are not limited to, the following: Handwashing (or using an antiseptic hand rub) After touching blood, bod y fluids, secretions, excretions and contaminated items Immediately after removi ng gloves Between patient contact Compre hensive CDC guidelines for hand hygiene in healthcare settings are found a t: https:// www.cdc.gov/ha ndhygiene/providers/ind ex.html Gloves For co ntact with blood, body fluids, secretions and contaminated items For co ntact with mucous membranes and non-intact skin Masks, goggles, face masks Protect mucous membranes of eyes, nose and mouth when contact with blood or bod y fluids is likely Gowns Protect skin from blood o r body fluid contact Prevent soiling of clothing during procedures that may invol ve contact with bl ood or body fluid Linen Handle soiled linen as to prevent touching skin or mucous membranes Do not pre-rinse soiled linens in patient care areas 236 Patient care equipment Handle soiled equipm ent in a mann er to prevent contact with skin or mucous membranes and to prevent contamination of clothing or the environment Clean reusable equipm ent prior to reuse Environmental cleaning Routinely care, clean and disin fect equipment and furnishi ngs in patient care a reas Sharps Avoid recapping used needles Avoid removi ng used needles from disposable syringes Avoid bending , breaking or mani pulating used needles by hand Place used sharps in punc ture-resistant containers Additiona l information is n Use mout ventilation devices to avoid mouth- to-mouth resuscitation Patient placem ent Place patients who contaminate the environment or cannot maintain appropriate hygiene in private rooms Needle sticks Incidents involving needle sticks and potential exposure to blood- borne pathogens require immediate action to protect a student's health and safety. CDC guidelines for the prevention of blood- borne infectious disease following an exposure are found at: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/emergnedl.html If a student sus tains a needle stick or is exposed to i nfectious m aterials he/she shoul d: Immediately w ash exposure site thoroughly with soap and water (or water only for mucous me mbranes). Immediately notify the clinical supervisor at the rotation site for assistance. Call/go to the Campbell University's Health Center or the occupational health clinic or area of the clinical facility designated for treating needl e stick exposur es. Time ly consultation concerni ng appropriate tests, risk-assess ment couns eling and chemoprophylaxis decisions a re critical. 237 Be evaluated immediately following an exposure event to determine HIV post -exposure prophylaxis is appropriate. HIV post-exposure prophylaxis is most effective when initiated within the first fe w hours following an exposure so it is critical that students are evaluated in a timely manner . This will ensure that if post- exposure prophylaxis is indicated, then it is started as early as possible in order to increase its effectiveness. Proceed immediately to the Emergency Department for evaluation if exposure has occurred a fter normal business hours, or are for any other r eason unable to be evaluated at one of the a bove locations. Complete an incident report from the facility in which the incident occur red and ha ve a copy of the report sent to the Campbell University's Health Center (PO Box: 565, 129 T.T. Lanier St., Buies Creek, NC 27506). Send treatment and testing bills to the student's insurance compa ny. Students are responsible for all costs not covered by their insurance. CDC guidelines for the prevention of blood borne infectious dis ease follow ing an exposure are found a t: https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/emergnedl.html In the event of an exposure, the National Clinician's Post-Exposu re Prophylaxis Ho tline (PEPline) is available by phone , (888) 448-4911, 11am-8pm Eastern, seven days per week to provide guidance in managing exposures. For exposures or questions that occur outside these hours, a PEP Quick Guide for Occupational Exposures is available at their website: http://nccc.ucsf.edu/clinician- consultation/pep- post-exposure - prophylaxis/ pr evention of inf ection transmission in health care settings are found at the following websites and should be reviewed carefully before participating in any patient care act ivities: https://www .cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/pdf/outpatient/ guide.pdf https://www .cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/ba sics/index.html 7.1.6 Medical Emergencies The safety of students, faculty, staff and visitors to the Health Science Campus is of utmost concern and the utilization of a standard approach to medical emergencies will ensure the provision of the most timely, efficient , and appropriate care in a medical emergency. As a school of osteopathic medicine, CUSOM's focus and expertise is in the domain of medical education. While many capable and compassionate health care prov iders are present on our campus on any given day, their role in this setting is as educators and administrators rather than as clinicians. While able to render immediate assistance in a life -threatening emergency, they should not be consulted to make 238 treatment or disposition recommendations in non- emergent situations. Anyone suffering from a medical emergency must be evaluated by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) which is activated by dialing 9 -1-1. If anyone on the Health Science Campus suffers from a m edical emergency, the person of first contact with the patient should dial 911 immediately to summon EMS assistance. Following activation of the EMS system, security must be notified of the situation and will also be responsible for contacting EMS to confirm the need for emergency response as well as to provide them with more detailed information regarding the location of the patient and instructions for appropriate access to the building. Security will complete, and maintain, an incident report form for any situation in which EMS is called to provide assistance, even if the patient ultimately refuses treatment and/or transport. Incident Reporting If a student suffers an accident resulting in an injury during a CUSOM activity while on campus, the student must complete an incident report, and call/go to the Campbell University's Health Center for consultation and assistance. Incident reports can be obtained from Campbell University's Health Center (910) 893- 1560. If the accident occurs at a clinical trai ning facility, that facility's incident report form should be completed, and the clinical supervisor, Director of Student Medical Education or Director of Medical Education, the Regional Dean and the CUSOM Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs should be contacted for assistance. A copy of the facility's incident report must be sent to: Campbell Student Health Services P.O. Box: 565 129 T.T. Lanier St. Buies Cr 27506 7.1.7 OSHA a nd HIPAA Training CUSOM is committed to ensuring the privacy and security of all patient health information as required by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). As such, all students are required to complete HIPAA training each academic year. To support our commitment to patient confidential ity, CUSOM and its clinical partners have developed processes to ensures that the appropriate steps are taken to verify the identity and authority of individuals and entities requesting protected health information, as required under 45 C.F.R. \u00a7164.514(h) and other applicable federal, state, and/or local laws and regulations. Medical Emergency Identified Call 911 Contact CUSOM Security for 239 Additionally, CUSOM ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information systems containing electronic protected health information by implementing policies to prevent, detect, mitigate, and correct security violations. CUSOM is in compliance with the US Department of Health and Human Services' Privacy Rule as it applies to the creation, collection, use or disclosure of all individual health information (whether identifiable or not) (\"Information\") in connection with CUSOM. In addition, CUSOM requires that all students who have contact with patients receive OSHA Blood -Borne Pathogens (BBP) training which addresses the prevention of transmission of communicable pathogens. Students complete OSHA training annually during which time they review OSHA rules, requirements, appropriate plans and practices. CUSOM has the following plans in place: Blood-borne Pathogen Exposure Plan Infectious Waste Management Plan Biohazard Waste Management Plan The intent of these plans is to prevent blood borne infections by eliminating or minimizing employees and students exposure to blood, blood produc ts, and other potential ly infectious mat erials. 7.2 Behavioral Health 7.2.1 Counseling Services Confidential counseling services are available 24 -hours -a-day, seven -days-a- week in a confidential manner through a combination of resources which includes clinical services offered by the CUSOM Department of Behavioral Health (CUSOM BH) u nder the leadership of the Departmental Chair and Clinical Director ( https://medicine.campbell.edu/behavioral -health ), and StudentLinc, a student assistance program. Working with Academic and Student Affairs, the Clinical Director for the Department of Behavioral Health, a licensed mental health professional, and other CUSOM Behavioral Health clinical staff are available during normal business hours for direct student contact. CUSOM Behaviora l Health clinical staff are also available as a point -of-contact for after -hours issues in conjunction with StudentLinc described below. CUSOM Behavioral Health clinical staff provide counseling for CUSOM students in two (2) on- campus locations based on s tudent preference: Leon Levine Hall and the Campbell Health Center . In addition to publication in the 240 Academic Bulletin, students are advised of the location of this service and how to access behavioral health services during Orientation as well as periodically throughout the year.

The law states that a person with a \" disabil ity\" is: \"Someone with a physical or ment al impairm ent which substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; or a person with a record of such impairm ent; or a person who is regard ed as having suc h an impairm ent.\" (Section 504 of the Rehabilitation A ct of 1973) Equal educat ional opport unity me ans that a person with a disabilit y who is qualified for admission must have access to the same unive rsity programs, services, and activities as all other students. I f necessar y to provide equal opportuni ty, Campbell will make reasonable modi fications to its policies, practices and procedu res, unless doing so would funda ment ally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity or pose an undue administrative or financial burden . Under the provisions of Section 504, unive rsities may not discriminate in the recruitme nt, admission, educat ional process, or treatment of students. S tudents who have self-identifie d, provide d document ation of disabili ty, and requested reasonable accom modations are entitled to receive approved modi fications of programs, appropriate academic adjustments, or auxiliary aids that enable them to participate in and benefit from all educat ional progra ms and activities. Section 504 specifies that unive rsities may not limit the number of students with disabilit ies admitted, make preadmissions inqui ries as to wh ether or not an applicant has a disabi lity, use admission tests or criteria that inadequately measure the academ ic qua lifications of students with disabilit ies because special provisions were not mad e, exclude a qualified student with a disabilit y from any course of study, or establis h rul es and pol icies th at may adversely affect studen ts wi th disabili ties. In support of its commitment to provide equal educational oppor tunity, Campbell provide s a variety of services and accom modations to students with document ed disabilit ies. C ampbell Univ ersity's Student Guide for Accessin g Disability Services can be accessed here. Questions or c omments about this manual should be directed to: Laura Rich Director of Disability Services Student Services, Students with Disa bilities Section I - Wh o to C ontact Students with doc ument ed disabili ties who de sire mod ifications or accom modations must c ontact the CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs : Jennifer Parrish O'Dell , MEd CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs Leon Levine H all of M edical Sciences, Room approv al through the University's pro cess. A medi cal, psychological or other diagnosis may rise to the level of a disabilit y if it substantially limits one or more major life functions, one of which is learning. A dis ability may be tempor ary or ongoing. Section II: Ho w to Obtain Services General Procedur e for Receiving Acco mmodations Step 1: Incoming or current students are requested to contact the Executive Director of Student Affairs to request se rvices as soon as poss ible. The Unive rsity is not responsible for identi fying students with disabilit ies and is not required to provide s ervices unless prope r pro cedures have been follow ed in ma king a request. Step 2: The student must schedule a meeting with the Executive Director of Student Affairs , who consul ts with the Director of Disability Services to provide document ation of the dis ability and to com plete the a ppropri ate paperwork. Step 3: The Executive Director of Student Affairs reviews the student's request and supporting doc ument ation, if neede d. The process of review d epends in part on the nature of the student's disability. Decisions re garding accom modations are made on a case-by-case basis. T here is no stand ard accom modation for any particular disability . CUSOM will make r easonable modifi cations to its policies, practices and procedure s, unless doing so would fundament ally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity or pose an undue administrative or fin ancial bu rden. 246 Step 4: If the request for accommodations is approve d, the Executive Director of Student Affairs generates a Letter of Accom modation (LOA) documenting the student 's individual, approve d accom modations. The O ffice of S tudents Affairs coordi nates dissemination of the LOA. Any student whose requested accom modations are not approve d is encouraged to meet with the Executive Director of Student Affairs to discuss the reasons for the denial. The Executive Director may discuss the g rievanc e proc edure with the student a t this time. Additional Information Regarding Accommodations Do cumentation For any stude nt deemed eligible, CUSOM provide s modations or modi fications to policies and pract ices in order to ensure that all students have equal access to all CUSOM programs, services, and ac tivities. The p urpose of accom modations is to provide access and equal educational opportunity for all students . Accom modations are not provide d retroactively. Any student approv ed for accom modations is entitled to services and accom modations only from the date the approva l is given. E ven if the stude nt can establis h he/she had a disabilit y at the time of the course in question, CUSOM will not expung e or re-exam ine coursework completed b efore the stude nt was reviewed and approved for accom modation(s). No student is required to disclose his or her disabilit y to the Unive rsity. However, as discuss ed above, any student who discloses and receives approve d accom modations after he/she has begun study at CUSOM will not receive any retroactive accom modations on work comple ted before the approva l for accom modations w as made. Document ation of a student's disabilit y is only shared with relevant CUSOM f aculty, staff or administration on a need-to-know b asis with a release of info rmation s igned by the student . Service Animal Information Accordi ng to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a service animal is defined as \"any animal individual ly trained to work or perform tasks for the b enefit of an individual with a disability , includin g, but not limited to, guiding ind ividuals with impaired vision, alerting indi viduals to an impending seizure or protecting ind ividuals during one , alerting individuals who are hearing i mpaired to intruders, pulling a wheelc hair and fetching droppe d items\". P roviding comfo rt or suppor t does not qual ify an animal as a service animal. If the re are any questions as to whether an animal qualifies as a service animal, a determination is made by Executive Director of Student Affairs with consultation with the Director of Disability Services . 247 In compl iance with the ADA, service animals are welcome in all bu ildings on campus and m ay attend any class, meet ing, or other event. Se rvice animals are ex pected to ex hibit reasona ble b ehavior while on campus. The owners of disrupt ive and aggressive service animals may be asked to remove t hem from unive rsity facilities. If the imprope r behavior hap pens repeated ly, the owne r may be told not t o bring the service animal into a ny facility until they take si gnifi cant s teps to m itigate the behavior . Emotional support animals are animals that provide comfo rt and relieve symptoms of ment al health disorde rs. Emotional support a nimals are not allowed in campus buildings, including classrooms and dining facilities unless it is d eemed as a reasonable accom modation and will be inclu in Letter of Accom modation (LOA) from CU SOM. The CUS OM Executive Director of Student Affairs can provide further information. Cleanliness of any approved service or emotional support animal on campus is mandatory. Consideration of others must be taken into account when providing maintenance and hygiene of animals. The owner is expected to clean up and dispose of all animal wast e. If the service or emotional support animal becomes a disruption to other students, the animal must be removed to a location that does not cause a disruption to the education of other students. Confidentiality of Information Information received from a student is governed unde r the provisions of the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. Unde r the provisions of this la w, students in post-secondar y education have the right to inspe ct and review their school records as defined by law.

Section III: S tudent Responsibilities General Student Responsibilities 1. Identify him/herself to the Executive Director of Student Affairs to begin the process of requesting accom modations. CUSOM is not respons ible for identi with disabili ties or for contacting su ch students to begin the accom modation r equest process. 2. Provide document ation which conforms to the University's guidelines. If the student's document ation is insuf ficient for any reason, the student is respons ible for pursuing whatever additional document ation is required and to pa y any costs thereof. CUSOM reserves the r ight not to provide services or a ccommodations until all of the documen tation sp ecified in the g uidelines is provided. 3.

It is very important that testing information be shared with these offices in a timel y mann er. At the beginning of the semest er, and at least one week prior to the first scheduled test, the student should discuss with the O ffice of Assessme nt, A ccredi tation and Medical Education or the D epartment of Clinical Affairs all approved testing accommodations. This discussion should address the que stions of how, when and where the Office of Assessment, Accredi tation and M edical Education or the Department of Clinical Affairs will provide the testing accom modations. The student should make sure to have a calen dar and a copy of the LOA with him/her at the time of this discussion. The student should also remind the Office of As sessme nt, Accreditation and Medical Education or the D epartment of Cl inical Affairs of their need for accom modations at least one w eek prior to each te st/exam . 249 If at any time you feel that the Office of Assessmen t, Accredi tation and Medical Edu cation, or the Department of Clinical Affairs is not adequately meet ing your accom modations, discuss this with the Office of Assessme nt, Accredi tation and M edical Education or Department of Clinical Affairs and the Executive Director of Student Affairs immedi ately . Rememb er, the Office of Assessme nt, A ccredi tation and M edical Education or the Department of Clinical Education is only required to provide accom modations spe cifically listed in the Letter of Accom modation. Responsibilities of a Student Approved for Handicapped Parking Students who use handicappe d parking on camp us must maintain state- issued ha ndicap parking perm its. The student is also required to purchase an appropri ate parking sticker from the Campbell University Departm ent of Campus Safety. If a student has consistent probl ems finding necessa ry handicapped parking n ear his/her class buildings, notify the Executive Director of Student Affairs and the Campbell University D epartment of Campus Safety immedia tely. Section IV: Doc umenting a Disability General Do cumentation Guidelines To ensure reasonable and appropri ate services and accom modations are provide d to students with disabilit ies, students requesting such accom modations and services must provide current document ation of their disability . S uch doc umentation generally must include the followin g: A clear diagnosti c statement of the disability prepared by a licensed prof essional A description of the mann er in which the disab ility limits the student in a specified major life activit y and the s everity of the limitation It is the respons ibility of the student requesting the accom modations and services to document the disability . As such, the cost of evaluations required pursua nt to these guidel ines is to be borne by the student. If there is a change in the student's condition, he/she may request modi fications to previously approve d accom modations. The student will have to provide current suppor ting do cument ation for review at that time. An Indivi dualized Education Plan (IEP) or a 504 plan may help to suppl ement documentation, but are genera lly insuf ficient docum entation whe n presented a lone. 250 Guidelines for Documenting a L earning Dis ability Every report should be on letterhead, typed, dated, signed and otherwise legible, a nd be comprised of the following elements: Eval uator I nformation: The n ame, t itle, and credentials of the qualified profe ssional who conduc ted the a ssessment should begin the r eport. P lease note that memb ers of the stude nt's family are not c onside red appropri ate evaluato rs. Recen t Assessment: The report m ust provide adequate information about the stude nt's current lev el of functioning. If such information is missing, the student may be asked to provide a more recent or compl ete assessment. Testing: There should be a discu ssion of all tests that were administe red, observations of the student's behavior during testing, and a listing of all of his/her test scores (i.e. domain, cluster, subtest, index, etc.) represented in standard scores and/or percentile ranks. Informal assessme nt, an Individuali zed Education Plan (IEP), or a 504 plan m ay help to suppl ement a more compre hensive insuf ficient docum entation whe n presented a lone. In addition, a clinical summary and a clearly sta ted diagnosis are helpful and should be included in the report. The sum mary should integrate the elements of the battery with back ground infor mation, observations of the client during the testing situation, a nd the student's current academ ic situation. This summary should present evide nce of a substantial limitation to learning and explain how the patterns of strength and w eakn ess are sufficiently significant to substantiate a learning disabilit y dia gnosis. I t should also demons trate that the evaluator has ruled out alternative explanations for the learning probl em. If social or emotional factors are found to be possible obstacles to learning, they should be discuss ed. This summary may include recom mended accom modations, but these are in no way bindi ng to the Univ ersity. CUS OM reserves the right to evaluate all document ation and de termine approp riate Proced ure All requests for accom modations or special services should first be brought to the CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs . Problem s with approve d accomm odations or services should first be reported in writing to the CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs . 251 If the student is unable to resolve the matter with the CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs , the student and the CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs should forward the complaint to the Director of Disability Services for an informal resolut ion. The Director of Disabi lity Services will arrange a meeting with the student and CUSOM Executive Director of Student Affairs within ten ( 10) business d ays of receiv ing the compla int. In the event that the student is dissatisfied with the informal resolut ion, he/she may file a compla int with the Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students. The Vi ce President for Student Life and Dean of Students will arrange a meeting with the student and Director of Disability Services with in ten ( 10) business d ays of receiv ing the compla int. If the student is unable to resolve the matter with the Director of Disability Services, the student and the Director of Disability Services should forward the complaint to the Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students for an informal resolution. The VP will arrange a meeting with the student and Director of Disability Services within ten (10) business days of receiving the complaint. In the event that the student is dissatisfied with the informal resolution, he/she may file complaint with the Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost if the issue involves denial of an academic accommodation. Students are also encouraged to exercise their rights of complaint through the Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights an d other legal channels if needed. 7.3 Clubs and Organizations 7.3.1 Student Clubs and Organizations Student clubs and organizations are a very important part of the Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM). The service performed by members of student organizations benefits not only the community and the region, but also the members, as they gain valuable knowledge, skills, and experience. Many CUSOM students are actively involved in at least one organization, and some students are m embers of several. CUSOM students may serve as officers or committee members at the state, regional or national level. The goals of student clubs and organizations relate to the M ission of CUSOM and the osteopathic profession. As such, the following are the endorsed student clubs and organizations at CUSOM: 252 American Medical Association - Medical Student Section (A MA-MSS) Anesthesiology Interest Group (AIG) Campbell Med PRIDE (CMP) Campbe ll University Care Clinic (CUCC) Christian Medical and De ntal Association (CMDA) Dermatology Club Emergency Medicine Club (American College of Osteopathic Emergency Physicians (ACOEP) Family Medicine Club (ACOFP and AAFP) Global Health/M edical Missions Club Internal Medicine Club (ACOI and AC P) Internal Medicine -Pediatrics Club (Med -Peds) Obstetrics and Gynecol ogy Club Pathology Club Pediatrics Club (American College of Osteopathic Pediatricians (ACOP)) Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Club (PM&R ) Point of Care Ultrasound Club (POCUS) Preventative Medicine Club Psychiatry Club Sigma Sigma Phi, Chi Upsilon Chapter Sports Medicine Club (American Osteopathic Academy of Sports Medicine (AOASM)) Student Advocate Association (SAA) Student American Asso ciation of Osteopathy (SAAO) Student Association of Military Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons (SAMOPS) Student Government Association (SGA) Student Interest Group in Neurology (SIGN) Student National Medical Association (SNMA) Student Osteopathic Medical Asso ciation (SOMA) Student Osteopathic Surgical Association (SOSA) Wilderness M edicine Club Women in Medicine Club The above list may not b e all-inclusive and is subj ect to change at any time.

The Medicine Alumni Board will establish the bylaws, mission, vision and goals for the Campbell Medicine Alumni Association and work with the Alumni Office to add benefits for t he Association and plan special events. They are the Alumni voice for Campbell Medicine in the Medical School and University communities. 7.3.5 CUSOM Committees Campbell University School of Osteopathic Medicine (CUSOM) values the talents, perspective and experience of its students and the positive contributions they make to key operational, academic, and improvement efforts of the school. As such, student participation and contributions are solicited whenever possible. Appointments to Committees diff ers from appointment as a student government representative or class leader, and appointment to, and service on, a CUSOM Committee should be considered a privilege. The process begins with the Office of Academic Affairs identifying student vacancies on CU SOM Committees, as approved by the Dean, prior to the start of each academic year (and as vacancies arise within an academic year). Student members of CUSOM Committees must meet pre -identified criteria including, but not limited to, the student being in g ood standing at all times relative to: Academic standing: A cumulative GPA of 3.00 or higher on a 4.0 scale is required at the time of appointment. If the GPA falls below the minimum required for appointment at any time, the student will be asked to ste p down from service to focus on her/his academics. This requirement also includes COMLEX performance, and any student failing any level of COMLEX must relinquish their role on any CUSOM Committees. Professionalism: No student is permitted to serve on a C USOM Committee if they are on Conduct Probation or otherwise have any issues related to Honor Code or Professionalism infractions. Committee service of students with an Admonition is determined based on the recommendation of the APPS Committee at the time the Admonition is assigned or by the APPS Committee Chair if an Admonition is assigned by the Chair instead of an APPS Committee hearing . If an appointed student has a documented professionalism issue at any time, the student will be required to step dow n from the committee service. 262 Other: All other requirements necessary to be a registered student in good standing, such as payment of tuition, must be met. First-year students may not serve on CUSOM Committees, except in rare circumstances, until they su ccessfully complete Block 2. At designated times in the first- and second -year of medical school, the class officers are asked by the Office of Student Affairs to solicit names of students who have interest in the identified CUSOM Committees which include student membership. The Office of Student Affairs provides the charge of each Committee and the desired qualities of the ideal student member. Interested students submit materials addressing how they meet the stated needs of the Committee based on their interests and experiential base. These materials are submitted to the class officers at a time designated by the Office of Student Affairs in conjunction with the class officers. The class officers review all submissions in a fair, impartial, and unbias ed manner, and send to the Office of Student Affairs their recommendations for no more than three (3) students they identify for each Committee vacancy. The Office of Student Affairs then works with the Office of Academic Affairs to ensure each student recommended meets all the stated prerequisites for service. Once verified, the names are forwarded to the respective Committee Chairs, who are given a brief timeframe to review the applications and select the student(s) they wish to invite to serve on the committee. The Office of Student Affairs will notify the students selected, as well as those not selected, of the outcome. All faculty and student committee appointments are subject to approval by the Dean. 263 8. Research and Scholarly Activity 8.1 Research at CUSOM Research is fundamental to, consistent with, and a prerequisite for excellence in teaching and the creation of a scholarly atmosphere for learning. CUSOM recognizes the critical role for developing its research capacity in order to cont inue to attract and retain top -tier faculty and students, thereby training students for productive careers in osteopathic medicine, biomedical research, and in making valuable contributions to society. Research and scholarly activity at CUSOM may take dif ferent forms, which may include basic biomedical research, translational research, clinical research, and medical educational research. 8.2 Policy Statement on Student Research and Scholarly Activity CUSOM strives to advance scientific and medical knowledge and to promote the distinctive philosophy and practice of osteopathic medicine. Whereas CUSOM specifically supports the academic and scholarly pursuits of students and faculty, this policy specifically addresses student research and scholarly activiti es. CUSOM does not require students to complete an independent research project or scholarly activity as a requirement for graduation. However, CUSOM is committed to supporting students in pursuing research and extracurricular scholarly opportunities. W hereas students are encouraged to participate in research, students are not permitted to act as a principal investigator (PI). Rather, they must partner with a faculty member or preceptor who takes on the role of PI. Furthermore, CUSOM requires all stude nts who are interested in engaging in research to notify the Associate Dean for Research of their intent. As such, student -researchers are provide with an additional layer of oversight and support in addition to their faculty or preceptor mentor. 8.3 Education in Research Principles Principles of responsible conduct in research (RCR) are presented in the Foundations of Medical Practice (FMP) course throughout Years One and Two. Topics include general principles of research ethics, human subject protections and the responsibilities of CUSOM students in basic science and clinical research. Additional education opportuni ties in research, scientific method, statistics, and scholarly activities are presented throughout the curriculum and through workshops associated with extracurricular research activities. As active members of a research team, students may be required to complete the associated CITI training, if appropriate. If such training is required, the student must provide the Associate Dean of Research with documentation of completion prior to beginning work on the project. Additional training specific to the rese arch project will be provided by the research mentors. 264 8.4 Research Opportunities CUSOM students may pursue research and scholarly activities in many areas of individual interest. Faculty mentors in areas of biomedical and clinical research are available to provide guidance for student scholarly work. The faculty mentor has overall responsibility for the conduct of research or scholarly activity, and is ultimately responsible for obtaining approval from regulatory committees as needed. As such, CUSOM requires that a faculty member approve all scholarly activity undertaken by students; however, student and faculty investigators may share the responsibility for complying with policies related to research ethics. For a student -initiated project, the student must have a faculty or preceptor sponsor, who will serve as the project PI and student mentor. The student may prepare the relevant proposals and applications in close cooperation with the mentor. Mentors and students are responsible for conducting their research in accordance within University and institutional affiliates' research policies. Students wishing to earn credit for biomedical research, clinical research or other scholarly activities may enroll in the Research (Independent Study) electiv e during the fourth year. Description of the course requirements are available in the syllabus and elsewhere in this Academic B ulletin. Students participating in the research clerkship elective must comply with all appropriate regulatory requirements, wh ich may include Institution Review Board approval prior to initiation of the project. Students and their faculty mentors are responsible for knowing which compliance requirements are appropriate. 8.5 Medical Student Summer Research Scholars Program Each year a limited number of 7 -week paid research fellowships are available to CUSOM medical students during the summer between their MS -1 and MS -2 years. These opportunities are designed to expose students to basic science, clinical or simulation medicine re search to gain valuable experience in research and explor e various clinical disciplines. Students are incorporated in to the laboratories to work with fulltime CUSOM faculty or are placed in CUSOM clinical sites to work with practicing physicians. The S cholars Program is designed to help medical students acquire a greater understanding , and application , of methodologies which support healthcare innovation and to envision themselves as physician scientists.

This list is not all- inclusive and the changes outlined may further change as the situation dictates. Safety of CUSOM students, faculty and staff is paramount and is the driving force for these changes, which are only for the 2020- 2021 Academic Year. Admissions Requirements CUSOM has already adjusted its admissions requirements for the 2020- 2021 admissions cycle to afford flexibility throughout the application process for prospective students, while maintaining high academic and personal standards. CUSOM will ensure individual and holistic review of each application, and how COVID -19 has impacted the pathway to medical school. To this end, CUSOM will: Accept all pass/fail grades from coursework, including pre -requisite course work, taken at a regionally accredited institution during semesters impacted by COVID - 19. Accept all on -line coursework, including lab credits, taken at a regionally accredited institution during semes ters impacted by COVID -19. Review verified applications from candidates who have not completed all required lab credits if their institutions were unable to provide these courses during affected semesters (completion at a later date may be required). Review verified applications with unofficial transcripts if the applicant's institution cannot provide official transcripts due to the pandemic. Official transcripts will be required prior to an offer of acceptance. Review verified applications, invite qualifie d candidates to complete secondary applications, and invite qualified candidates for admission interviews prior to receiving MCAT scores. o Planned MCAT exams for which you are currently registered should be indicated on the AACOMAS application. o Completion of the MCAT and receipt of official MCAT scores will be required prior to an offer of acceptance. Consider applications from candidates with fewer health care experience hours and other extracurricular experiences if planned experiences were cancelled or limited by the COVID -19 pandemic. Review applications, invite qualified candidates to complete secondary applications, and extend invitations for admission interviews prior to receiving t he required letter of recommendation from a DO or MD Physician. A letter of 281 recommendation from a DO or MD Physician will be required prior to an offer of acceptance. Consider virtual admission interviews for the 2020- 2021 admissions cycle to benefit the applicants: o Reducing unnecessary travel, contact and exposure of applicants to new communities to protectthe health of applicants, faculty and staff members, community members, and others during thepandemic. o Loweringinterview costs for prospective students. o Potentially increasingthe number of interviews in which applicants can participate. o Maintaining a consistent interview formatwithin your COM in order to ensure that virtual interviewees are not at a disadvantage to those who interview in person later in the cycle.

The Block calendars remain the same, and when live videoconferencing or interactive sessions are utilized, every attempt is made to hold these at the same time the content is scheduled on the Block Calendar. Dates of the Block quizzes and integrated exams remain unchanged, however, the timing of exams and certain sessions to later in the day may occur since some CUSOM students may be in western time zones. Laboratory and similar sessions o Clinical Skills All Clinical Skills sessions will be converted to interactive online sessions including faculty -facilitated small group case studies, standardized patient activities and real -time interactive virtual simulation. o Anatomy All Anatomy labs will be converted to virtual anatomy lab sessions with online assessments. o OMM All OMM labs will be converted to video instruction supplemented by interactive online discussions. Assessment of student understanding of techniques including indications, contraindications, patient positioning, hand placement, direction and magnitude of applied forces, etc. is through videoconference between an OMM faculty member and student in an oral exam -type format. A critical component of our approach to transition to remote learning is the maintenance of regular and meaningful engagement of our faculty with students. 284 As part of Campbell University, CUSOM has access to several university -provided tools and applications to facilitate faculty -student engagement, including Blackboard Collaborate, the Blackboard Learning Management System, WebEx Videoconferencing, and Panopto video recording and capture. MS-3 and MS -4 Clinical Rotation Changes In the event of a global pandemic, such as COVID -19, requiring the suspension of clinical rotations, third- and fourth- year students on clinical rotations will be assigned to an alternate rotation curriculum. The topics and assignments of the alternate rotation curriculum are designed to be related to the material of the rotation the students are to be completing on their respective schedules. If a student's core rotation is suspended, the student is responsible for the assignments, including the completi on of modules, from the original core rotation syllabus in addition to those in the alternate rotation syllabus. The student will also be required to take the end- of-rotation exam (COMAT) for the core rotation as describ ed in the rotation's syllabus. If a student's selective or elective rotation is suspended, the student is responsible for the assignments for the original selective rotation syllabus in addition to those in the alternate rotation syllabus. Furthermore, During times of crisis, including n atural disaster, national emergency, or such a related occurrence, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs may assign one of the fourth -year, non- clinical, independent study electives into the third -year Medical/Surgical Selective rotation block provided t he student has not already completed the rotation. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs may also exercise the option of moving the student's fourth- year vacation month into his/her third- year schedule. In addition, in such defined times of crisis, the A ssociate Dean for Clinical Affairs may allow a fourth -year student to complete three non- clinical, independent study electives in an attempt to satisfy the fourth -year elective requirement . COMATs During COVID- 19 For those rotations with an end- of-rotation exam (COMAT) constituting part of the final grade, the students took a self -proctored COMAT, referred to as \"COMAT -SP\" by the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBO ME). These self -proctored exams were subject to the University's Honor Code as published in CUSOM's Academic Bulletin and Clinical Rotation Manual. While NBOME issued these only until the end of the testing cycle, ending June 2020, it is assumed a similar global pandemic of COVID -19's proportions will result in NBOME issuing sel f-proctored COMATs as necessary 285 The rotations with a COMAT include : Internal Medicine II Family Medicine Surgery Pediatrics Obstetrics/Gynecology Psychiatry/Behavioral Healt h Emergency Medicine Grading During COVID -19 As described previously in the Academic Bulletin, the grade for a rotation with an end- of- rotation COMAT consists of 50% of the clinical rotation evaluation and 50% of the COMAT result. All other rotation grades were based on the clinical rotation evaluation alone. Rotation evaluations for the alternate rotation curricula are completed by the corresponding Clinical Chair or Clinical Advisor for the rotation as he/she serves as the clinical rotation precept or for the rotation. The alternate rotation curricula are set up to maximize clinical faculty and student interaction during the rotation, thereby allowing as accurate of reflection and feedback as possible when completing the rotation evaluation. Hybrid rotations, characterized by partial, live clinical rotation experiences and partial alternate rotation curriculum, are evaluated in the manner of a compositive evaluation. That is, feedback is provided by the clinical faculty preceptor from the in- person experience and by the Clinical Chair or Clinical Advisor for the alternate rotation curriculum. The evaluation ratings are averaged out to supply a grade, and comments from both preceptors are provided in the final evaluation. COMATs are calculated in, as above, if the rotation syllabus requires one. Audition Rotation Procedure Scheduling Clinical Rotations CUSOM will consider each student request on a case- by-case basis to determine if the requested rotation will enhance the student 's opportunity to have match success with either a specific specialty requirement completion or a location desirability. Influencing factors : o Availability of offered rotations may be severely limited based on site interpretations of the COVID -19 recommendations for their respective state. o More than three (3) away rotations will require additional supporting documentation from the student's advising Clinical Chair (Clinical Advisor) reflecting the opinion of th e particular specialty as it pertains to match success . 286 o Any audition rotation less than four (4) weeks in length will be supplemented with an alternate rotation curriculum to be designated by the appropriate Clinical Chair or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. Away rotation applications will be reviewed by the Clinical Chair (Clinical Advisor) and the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs for appropriateness and volume before the student is approved to participate in the rotation. The student will submit the Clinical C hair's approval to C linical Affairs for final comparison to the AACOM out -of-system algorithm and approval by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. All decisions are final and not subject to appeal. The AACOM Algorithm for out -of-system rotation will be compared to the request on a case -by-case basis . 287 Residency Interviews CUSOM will promote utilization of the online options available for applicants where it is reasonable to do so. Campbell University -affiliated GME programs have capabilities to perform online and virtual interviews. Each Campbell University -affiliated GME site will follow their own policies for offering and completing online interviews independent of Campbell University policies and procedures. Campbell University -affiliated GME programs will provide online interview training as part of the Residency D evelopment Month course offered in the 4th year of training. Students are required to provide interview times and dates to their clinical precept or in order to be excused for time missed from rotations. The rotation requirement remains 160 hours with allowances for four (4) interview days during a four -week rotation as defined in this Academic Bulletin. I f more than one (1) hour is required to be away from the clinical rotation , the student will need to fill out a Wufoo time - off request form for the half or whole day missed. ERAS and the MSPE A delayed opening of ERAS for residency programs and a delayed release of the medical student performance evaluation (MSPE) and the opening and release happen on the same day. CUSOM will make every attempt to meet any new deadlines and facilitate readiness of the student body to meet those deadlines. For each interview cycle impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic, the Office of Postgraduate Affairs and the Office of Clinical Affairs will compile the required list of essential dates and deadlines for application success and post this information in the R esidency Development Month course. Students are expected to meet any revised or amended deadlines. MSPE's will be completed according to the new timelines , if applicable, and students will still be responsible f or their three (3) noteworthy characteristics helping to personalize the ir MSPE during the R esidency Development Month course. Each candidate should request letters of recommendation from the Clinical Chairs for each of the specialt ies as they would have been requested prior to any timeline changes and will meet the new deadlines for submission within the ERAS system. 288 Transcript Changes For first and second year students In the event of a global pandemic or other disaster, courses may be delivered by remote learning, and students will be given the option to remain with the traditional grading scale, or to convert to an alternate Satisfactory (\"S\") or Fail (\"F\") grading scale for the affected time period. The alternate grading scale accrue zero quality points per hour, thereby having a neutral effect upon grade point average. The transcript will note the reasoning for the transition to remote learning. For third and fourth year students In the event of a global pandemic or other disaster, if student clinical rotations are cancelled, an alternative rotation curriculum will be adopted. The transcript will note the reasoning for the transition to an alternative rotation curriculum. Graduation Changes In the event that there is a resurgence of COVID -19 and there are local, state, or nation- wide restrictions, CUSOM will offer a Virtual Platform for Graduation. In the event of travel bans and state- wide restrictions, we encourage families to delay purchasing airline tickets and procuring lodging accommodations until further directives from the University. CUSOM will provide a personalized Virtual Celebration for the graduating class of 2021 for the DO/MSBS/MHPE programs in the event of state -wide orders. The Office of the Registrar along with the Offic e of Student Affairs will work with students to verify permanent mailing addresses for each student. Diplomas and other materials related to Graduation will be mailed to students at the address provided and verified by each student. CUSOM will work coope ratively with Campbell University and University directives regarding in -person or virtual ceremonies, diploma conferral dates, and any virtual links to Commencement exercises. 289 Behavioral Health Department Service Changes Clinical Service Policy Until such time as social distancing requirements are lifted, CUSOM's Department of Behavioral Health will continue to provide all clinical services remotely via phone or through the HIPAA/FERPA compliant WebEx application. This modality of service delive ry is to be maintained even if departmental clinicians are physically on campus while providing services. Departmental Service Protocol 1. Students and other parties seeking counseling services can request an appointment the departmental Administrativ e Assistant (Mrs. Teresa Butrum) will contact said party and have them complete the online intake form. 3. Once the intake form is completed, the party will be sent the available times for all clinicians within the department along with a request for their pr eference regarding the venue of service delivery (i.e., phone/WebEx). Wrap -Around Services In addition to Behavioral Health clinical staff, CUSOM utiliz es the services of StudentLinc, a 24/7/365 s tudent assistance program that offers wrap-around psychosoc ial support services. Services are acces sed through StudentLinc's online web portal: https://www .mystude ntlinc.com/ or via their mobile application. StudentLinc Core Services include but are not limited to: Unlimited c onfidential tele-counseling with StudentLinc p roviders by phone , video or w eb-based chat Five (5) sessions at no cost with community provi ders for an unlimited number of unr elated issues Crisis counseling/management Case management and referral to community resources Financial counseling Access to on line information and training repository Students on clinical rotations may use Student Linc or obtain inf ormation concer ning B ehavioral Health services within their local region throu gh the CUSOM Office of Clinical Affairs or the local Regional Assistant Dean's office. 290 Clinical Emergency Policy Until such time as social distancing guidelines are suspended, any client that expresses suicidal or homicidal ideation will be evaluated by their clinician, and if it is deemed that they are at emergent risk, 911 will be contacted and a sheriff's deputy w ill be sent to their location to conduct a well -check. Depending on the nature and severity of the event, the client may then be referred out to a community provider to better address their needs. Referrals will be made either by the clinician directly o r through CUSOM's student assistance program (i.e., StudentLinc) . Departmental Service Protocol 1. The departmental clinician will conduct an evaluation to determine the nature and severity of the ideation . 2. If the clinician determines that the client is at emergent risk, 911 will be notified and a local sheriff's deputy will be sent to their current address for a well -check. Additionally, the clinician will remain in contact with the client until the sheriff arrives. All clients seen by the department within the last three months will be sent a link to update their information within the HER . Current and home addresses are required client information and must be filled out prior to scheduling an appointment . 3. The clinician will also inform the client's emergen cy contact of the situation . The departmental service agreement has been amended to reflect this change in policy. Emergency contact information is now also required before a client can schedule an appointment . 4. Once the client has been taken into custody, the clinician will inform their direct supervisor of the event . 5. The clinician will thoroughly document the incident in the client's chart within the departmental electronic health records system . 6. Depending on the nature and severity of the event, the client may then be referred out to a community provider for follow -up care. Referrals will be made directly by the clinician or through the student assistance "}
