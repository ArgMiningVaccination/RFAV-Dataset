LR FAQS WHAT IS YOUR NEW PATIENT PROCEDURE? All new patients are first scheduled for a consultation to go over treatment goals and individualized treatment programs. Patients can receive acupuncture treatment the same day as their consultation. ARE YOUR SERVICES COVERED BY MY INSURANCE? Our office is an out-of-network provider and we provide all paperwork necessary for patients to be directly reimbursed by their insurance companies if they have acupuncture coverage. HOW MANY TREATMENTS WILL I NEED? The number of treatments you will need will vary based on your specific condition and how long you have had it. Your initial consultation is where the practitioner will be able to give you her best recommendation for length of treatment needed. HOW MUCH WILL MY TREATMENT COST? The cost of an initial consultation is $40 and if you begin a treatment program, that payment will be applied to your treatment program. The total cost of your treatment program is determined at your consultation since it is individualized and based on your specific needs. There is no way to determine price or length of treatment over the phone before the practitioner meets with you.
