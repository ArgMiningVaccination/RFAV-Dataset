The protocol builds on existing work to ensure that Scotland's net zero targets are met while benefitting communities, landowners and businesses fairly, and helps put into practice the Scottish Government's [Interim Principles for Responsible Investment in Natural Capital](https://www.gov.scot/publications/interim-principles-for-responsible-investment-in-natural-capital/) to deliver a values-led, high-integrity market for responsible investment in natural capital. The protocol also highlights how existing natural capital owned by landowners should be protected and enhanced alongside the development of any other carbon activities and that investment in carbon management to offset emissions should always be made in addition to action to reduce emissions at source as close to zero as possible.
