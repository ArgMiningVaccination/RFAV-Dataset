An acupuncture session with us might be just what you need if you suffer from pain caused due to migraines, lower back pain, have problems with your digestion, or have not been feeling yourself lately. Here's what you should know about acupuncture for functional medicine. What is Acupuncture? Acupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that involves the insertion of thin needles into the skin at specific points to stimulate the movement of energy through a network of energy channels known as meridians. These meridians exist throughout the body, and a blockage in any one of them can lead to the onset of illness and disease that can affect not just the body, but your mind and spirit as well. What Are the Benefits of Acupuncture? According to modern research, acupuncture has proven to be effective at stimulating the body's various systems, including its cardiovascular, digestive, and immune systems. Regular acupuncture sessions can reduce chronic pain, improve digestion, and promote a sense of overall well-being. Acupuncture can be used to treat a variety of ailments, including: - Headaches and chronic migraines - Lower back pain - Osteoarthritis and knee pain - Depression and anxiety - Digestive issues - Menstrual cramps - Nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer What to Expect During an Acupuncture Session If you've never been to an acupuncture session before, it's only natural that you might wonder what to expect during your first appointment. An acupuncturist will begin by asking you a series of questions regarding your overall health status and if you have any areas of pain that need to be worked on. They may also do a quick physical examination that includes checking your pulse rate, as well as the color and coating of your tongue. This assessment will be the basis on which your acupuncturist carries out a treatment plan. The acupuncture session will then begin by lying down on a treatment table, either face up or down. Thin needles are then inserted into various acupressure points to stimulate the flow of energy and can be in place for up to 30 minutes. Most patients report feeling no to very little discomfort\u2014and only do so if they move around during treatment. If necessary, heat therapy, massage, topical herbal medicines, and cupping may also be recommended as accompanying procedures. "}
