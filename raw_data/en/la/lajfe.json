Indeed, an increased level of ASD knowledge in the general population may result in earlier diagnosis, earlier intervention, and better overall outcomes. The present study aimed to examine the current state of ASD knowledge, beliefs, and sources of information in a Lebanese general population sample, to identify the factors that could influence this knowledge. A total of 500 participants were involved in this cross-sectional study, which was conducted in Lebanon between May 2022 and August 2022 using the Autism Spectrum Knowledge scale, General Population version (ASKSG). Overall, the participants' understanding of autism spectrum disorder was low, with a mean score of 13.8 (6.69) out of 32, or 43.1%. The highest knowledge score was found for items related to knowledge of the symptoms and associated behaviors (52%). However, the level of knowledge regarding the etiology and prevalence, assessment and diagnosis, treatment, outcomes, and prognosis of the disease was low (29%, 39.2%, 46%, and 43.4%, respectively). Moreover, age, gender, place of residence, sources of information, and ASD case were all statistically significant predictors of ASD knowledge (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.012, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively). The general public in Lebanon perceive a lack of awareness and insufficient knowledge regarding ASD. This results in delayed identification and intervention, leading to unsatisfactory outcomes in patients. Raising awareness about autism among parents, teachers, and healthcare professionals should be a top priority.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-03-06", "cleaned_text": "Evaluation of the Lebanese Adults' Knowledge Regarding Autism Spectrum Disorder [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20054622](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20054622) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-ijerph-20-04622)]. [2](#B2-ijerph-20-04622)]. There are several potential explanations for this increased prevalence, including improvement in diagnostic criteria, better identification and screening methods, better access to healthcare, and increased awareness among parents and clinicians [ [3](#B3-ijerph-20-04622)]. Current estimates indicate that 1 in 100 children is diagnosed with ASD around the world [ [4](#B4-ijerph-20-04622)]. However, this prevalence is substantially higher in Lebanon, where it is estimated to affect between 49 and 513 children per 10,000 across all Lebanese regions [ [5](#B5-ijerph-20-04622)]. This rise suggests that many people are likely to interact with autistic individuals. Therefore, people must be well-informed, since ignorance increases the risk of misdiagnosis, which makes a child more challenging and therapy-resistant [ [6](#B6-ijerph-20-04622)]. Hence, it is crucial that the general public have accurate knowledge regarding ASD, since awareness and understanding could lead to early detection and diagnosis of this disorder [ [7](#B7-ijerph-20-04622)]. [8](#B8-ijerph-20-04622)]. Indeed, several studies have shown that early interventions in ASD are linked to significant improvements in cognition, language, and adaptive behavior [ [9](#B9-ijerph-20-04622), [10](#B10-ijerph-20-04622)]. [6](#B6-ijerph-20-04622), [11](#B11-ijerph-20-04622)]. However, limited research has been conducted on the general population's knowledge of ASD, especially in Lebanon. Golson et al. (2022) assessed the level of autism knowledge among a general population sample in the United States and found that participants in the study were more knowledgeable about the symptoms and behaviors associated with autism than the etiology, prevalence, and assessment procedures [ [12](#B12-ijerph-20-04622)]. Another study conducted by Alyami et al. (2022) determined the general awareness regarding ASD in Saudi Arabia and assessed variables associated with an accurate understanding of ASD. Overall, the participants showed a weak level of knowledge about ASD, with a mean score of 5.9. Furthermore, participants were more aware about the symptoms and behavior of ASD children, whereas they had a moderate to poor level of knowledge about ASD treatment and etiology [ [13](#B13-ijerph-20-04622)]. In sum, these results highlight the urgent need for increased awareness of ASD in the general population since it helps in minimizing possible associated social stigma and it is also needed for planning adequate autism education and awareness campaigns for a better inclusion of the ASD patients in the society [ [14](#B14-ijerph-20-04622)]. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Recruitment [15](#B15-ijerph-20-04622)]: 2.2. Data Collection Instrument [12](#B12-ijerph-20-04622), [13](#B13-ijerph-20-04622)]. It was initially developed in English and subsequently translated into Arabic to ensure that the Lebanese participants were able to understand it. A pilot study was conducted on 25 Lebanese adults to assess the clarity and comprehension of the questionnaire. After the analysis of the pilot study, our research team revised, updated, and submitted the questionnaire to the ethical committee of USEK. who reviewed and approved it. The questionnaire consisted of three sections: socio-demographic characteristics, ASD knowledge, and general beliefs about ASD. 2.2.1. Socio-Demographic Characteristics 2.2.2. ASD Knowledge 2.2.3. Beliefs about ASD [12](#B12-ijerph-20-04622)]. Participants must answer one of the following options: \"true\", \"false\", or \"don't know\". Each correct answer was given a score of 1, or a score of 0 if the response was not provided correctly. A score of 0 was also given for a response of \"don't know\" on the assumption that this response implies a lack of knowledge about the item. The higher the score, the more knowledgeable the participant. Therefore, a maximum and minimum total score of 32 and 0, respectively, is possible when the five domain scores are added together. The items are included in [Table 1](#ijerph-20-04622-t001). 2.3. Ethical Considerations 2.4. Data Analysis [1](#B1-ijerph-20-04622)]. The knowledge scores of different participants according to demographic characteristics were compared using the chi-square test. Multivariable linear regression analysis using all the demographic variables as independent variables and knowledge score as the outcome variable was conducted to identify predictors associated with this knowledge. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 3. Results 3.1. Participants' Demographic Characteristics [Table 2](#ijerph-20-04622-t002). 3.2. Perceived Knowledge among Participants and Their Source of Information [Figure 1](#ijerph-20-04622-f001)). [Table 3](#ijerph-20-04622-t003)). 3.3. Actual Knowledge about ASD 3.3.1. Current State of ASD Knowledge and Beliefs [Table 4](#ijerph-20-04622-t004)). Regarding knowledge of ASD etiology and prevalence, 47.6% endorsed the myth that vaccines cause ASD. Only 35% agreed that ASD is more common among boys than girls, and 53.2 percent identified that the emotional deprivation of the mother was not a cause of ASD. Few participants mentioned that advanced paternal or maternal age is a risk factor for ASD (21% and 11.4%, respectively). Moreover, few participants (17.4%) knew that there are racial/ethnic/regional disparities in ASD identification, and only 17.4% agreed that children with siblings who have ASD are at a higher risk of developing the disorder. 3.3.2. Participants' Knowledge Score and Their Predictors [Table 5](#ijerph-20-04622-t005)) and Factors Associated with ASD Knowledge [Table 6](#ijerph-20-04622-t006). Knowledge scores differed significantly by gender (p < 0.001), age group (p = 0.012), and region of residence (p = 0.026). In fact, more participants in the 25-34 years age group showed a good understanding of ASD compared to the other age groups; females showed a good understanding of ASD compared to males; and participants living in Beirut had significantly more knowledge of ASD compared to those of other regions. Moreover, our study found that there was a significant difference in knowledge between people who had a colleague with autism and those without (p < 0.001), and a significant difference was found between ASD knowledge and social media (p < 0.001), [Table 6](#ijerph-20-04622-t006). [Table 7](#ijerph-20-04622-t007). 4. Discussion [2](#B2-ijerph-20-04622)]. Moreover, participants showed a low level of knowledge about ASD. The highest knowledge score was found for items related to symptoms and associated behaviors. However, the level of knowledge about the cause, prevalence, diagnosis, outcomes, and treatment of this disorder was low. These findings contrast with a previous study conducted in the United States, which found that most participants demonstrated the most knowledge regarding the symptoms and behaviors associated with autism [ [3](#B3-ijerph-20-04622)]. Participants answered an average proportion of 64.3% of items correctly on the ASKSG, but in this study the proportion was lower (43.1%) [ [12](#B12-ijerph-20-04622)]. In a previous study conducted in Saudi Arabia, the participants had a poor understanding of the disorder and many misconceptions about it. There was a knowledge gap in the community regarding ASD, particularly among males, which is similar to the results of this study [ [13](#B13-ijerph-20-04622)]. Knowing the risk factors for ASD is important to reduce the chances of having a child with this disorder. In fact, it is proposed that several environmental factors could contribute to the development of this disorder. Among these have been suggested advanced maternal age (35 years), maternal chronic hypertension, pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, and being overweight before or during pregnancy [ [16](#B16-ijerph-20-04622)]. A case-control study, conducted between 2015 and 2020 in the Lebanese population, shed light on risk and protective factors associated with ASD. In this study, consanguinity, a familial history of ASD and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and maternal stress during pregnancy were identified as risk factors associated with ASD [ [17](#B17-ijerph-20-04622)]. Moreover, early detection of the disorder can significantly improve the quality of life of individuals with ASD as well as that of their caregivers and families [ [9](#B9-ijerph-20-04622)]. [18](#B18-ijerph-20-04622)]. For example, films are being used for educational and entertaining purposes. One study conducted by Conn et al. (2012) assessed the impact of 23 Hollywood films that portray autism spectrum disorders on public understanding as well as on medical students and psychiatric trainees. They found that these films provide the best opportunity for medical education and improvement in public awareness [ [19](#B19-ijerph-20-04622)]. At the same time, there are rising concerns that these social media platforms are spreading inaccurate or misleading health information. Indeed, misinformation about health is prevalent on social media, and is frequently defined as information that disputes the findings of experts in the field [ [20](#B20-ijerph-20-04622)]. As a result, information seekers must search for medical information from reliable resources such as the WHO or the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [ [21](#B21-ijerph-20-04622)]. [14](#B14-ijerph-20-04622), [22](#B22-ijerph-20-04622)]. A previous study that examined the knowledge about ASD in China reported that gender and socioeconomic status were important variables that had an influence on ASD knowledge [ [23](#B23-ijerph-20-04622)]. Moreover, our results showed that there was a significant difference in knowledge between people who had a colleague with autism and those without. This finding is consistent with earlier research. According to earlier studies, participants who directly interacted with people with ASD knew more since they had more experience [ [24](#B24-ijerph-20-04622)]. [25](#B25-ijerph-20-04622)]. Misconceptions regarding ASD services are also concerning. Families may waste money on ineffective interventions rather than effective services. Lack of awareness about ASD diagnosis and identification may contribute to delays in age of diagnosis [ [26](#B26-ijerph-20-04622)]. Increased ASD detection, parent psychoeducation, and communication between healthcare and parents are essential to addressing this knowledge gap. [27](#B27-ijerph-20-04622)]. Harrower et al. (2001) documented that students with disabilities, including students with autism, who are fully included in a general classroom environment displayed higher levels of engagement and social interaction. Moreover, they had larger friendship networks and received higher levels of social support [ [28](#B28-ijerph-20-04622)]. 5.
