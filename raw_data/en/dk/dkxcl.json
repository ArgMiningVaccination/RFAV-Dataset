Ayurveda is based on the belief that imbalances in your body, energy, and environment can trigger diseases. Using therapies like herbs, massage, diet, and lifestyle changes, Ayurveda aims to regain the equilibrium in the mind, spirit, body, and environment to promote health, healing, and wellness. Luckily, different healing crystals and gemstones can be used with Ayurvedic principles to rejuvenate your body and create a harmonious life. What Are the Doshas? Ayurveda and yoga describe three primary mind-body-energy constitutions, named doshas. Each person is made up of a combination of the doshas, with one dosha being prevalent. Your dominant dosha can affect everything from your body shape to your skin health, to your sleep. The three Doshas are pitta, Vata, and Kapha. Each dosha controls one or two of the five basic elements: space, air, fire, water, and earth. What is your Ayurvedic Dosha?
