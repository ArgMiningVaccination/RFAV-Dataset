The rules provide flexibility for evaluating different populations without altering measures' clinical intent (e.g., removal of continuous enrollment or product-line criteria). The Rules for Allowable Adjustments are included in the HEDIS Volume 2 publication after the applicable HEDIS measure specifications. NCQA's HEDIS Value Set Directory (VSD) includes the necessary third-party codes for use with adjusted measure specifications.
