The defining chara cteristic has been reported to be debilitating fatigue. It is not known what causes CFS although various hypotheses have been suggested, including immunological, viral, psychological and neuroendocrine factors. The uncertainty regarding the cause is refl ected in the wide variety of interventions which have been used in the treatment and management of CFS. These interventions have had different objectives including targeting of the underlying disease process, targeting of specific symptoms, focusing on c oping strategies, and encouraging rehabilitation. Evaluations of the effectiveness of different approaches suggest a variety of different outcomes and currently a number of interventions are used in the management of CFS. Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) has sometimes been reported to be a separate syndrome from CFS. However in the research literature CFS is commonly referred to as being the same illness as ME, post viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS) and all similar symptom complexes. The scope of this revi ew was to evaluate interventions for the management of CFS/ME. Therefore, unless specifically named symptom complexes were addressed, CFS/ME is the term used throughout this review. Objective To assess the effectiveness of all available interventions whic h have been evaluated for use in the treatment or management of adults and children with CFS/ME. Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted. Seventeen electronic databases were searched from database inception to February 2002. Additi onal studies were identified by scanning the bibliographies of retrieved articles, searching the world wide web, through requests to members of the advisory panel and the establishment of a web -site for the review through which additional references could be submitted. To be included in the review studies had to compare an intervention used in the treatment or management of CFS/ME to an untreated control group, or one given placebo or inactive control treatment. Studies in both adults and children with a diagnosis of CFS/ME, based on any criteria, were eligible for inclusion. All outcomes reported by the studies were considered relevant. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance. Retrieved studies were assessed for inclusio n by one reviewer and checked by another. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Data extraction and validity assessment were performed by one reviewer and checked by a second. Discrepancies were resolved by referral to the original studies. I f necessary arbitration was by a third reviewer. A qualitative analysis was undertaken due to the significant heterogeneity between studies in interventions and outcomes. Interventions were categorised into the following seven groupings: behavioural ; immunological; antiviral; pharmacological; supplements; complementary/alternative; other. Studies were judged to show some effect of treatment if any of the outcomes measured found a statistically significant difference between the intervention and contr ol groups. Studies were classified as having an overall effect (positive or negative) if they showed a statistically significant effect for more than one clinical (i.e. not a physiological) outcome or, if only one clinical outcome was measured, it was foun d to show a statistically significant effect. Where no significant differences occurred, a study was classified as showing no effect. The association between study results and treatment duration, validity score, and diagnostic criteria was investigated. Insufficient data were available to assess publication bias using standard methods (e.g. funnel plots), and it was therefore discussed narratively. ix Results Forty six studies met the inclusion criteria: 38 RCTs and eight controlled trials, eleven of the RCTs used a cross -over design. Of the included trials 29 (61%) showed some beneficial effect of the intervention and of these 18 (39%) showed an overall beneficial effect, one study (3%) reported a negative effect of the intervention. In some studies, participants were only eligible if they could physically get to the clinic. In other trials, limited information was given about participants who were ineligible or about the baseline functioning of many of those who were included. Behavioural Both c ognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and graded exercise therapy (GET) showed positive results. Three of the four RCTs evaluating CBT found a positive overall effect of the intervention and these studies also scored highly on validity assessment. One RCT which also included immunologic therapy and one controlled trial of modified CBT did not find overall beneficial effects of CBT. These two studies scored lower on the validity assessment, and the controlled trial presented within group differences rather t han between group differences. The studies evaluating CBT did not report any adverse effects of the intervention although in one RCT two participants dropped out of the CBT group because they felt a deterioration in their symptoms was due to the interven tion. A second RCT reported drop -out rates of around 20 -35% in all three intervention groups, with the highest rates in the CBT group, but reasons for drop -outs were not reported. All three RCTs of GET were of high quality and two found an overall bene ficial effect of the intervention compared to the control groups. The third, which also investigated Dialyzable Leukocyte Extract (DLE), found a beneficial effect of CBT compared with DLE for one of the outcomes investigated. The studies did not report any adverse effects of GET although two studies did report study withdrawals that may have been related to adverse effects of the intervention. Immunological Five RCTs investigated the effects of immunoglobulin G; four found some positive effect, two of w hich found an overall beneficial effect, and the fifth and largest found no effect of treatment. Some severe adverse effects were found in the studies of immunoglobulin G. Two participants had to withdraw from immunoglobulin G treatment due to severe constitutional symptom reactions and one person withdrew due to mild but transient liver failure. Phlebitis has also been noted with immunoglobulin infusions. It should be noted that immunoglobulins and leukocyte extract are blood products and there are kn own risks associated with their use, such as the possible transfer of infectious diseases. An overall beneficial effect of ampligen was found in one RCT. One RCT assessed the combined effect of leukocyte extract and cognitive behavioural therapy and alt hough no effect of leukocyte extract on its own was found a beneficial effect on one of the outcomes investigated in the group receiving both leukocyte extract and CBT was reported. One RCT evaluated the antihistamine terfenadine and found no beneficial ef fects. Antiviral Two RCTs evaluated interferon, one of which found an overall beneficial effect. The other presented only within group differences and so no conclusion regarding the effects of treatment can be drawn. No significant effects were found in a small RCT of ganciclovir, or in a controlled trial of vaccination with staphylococcus toxoid. The trial of gancilovir was ended prematurely due to adverse events in the intervention group. The effect of aciclovir was assessed in one small RCT and a ne gative effect was reported for some of the outcomes investigated. Three people had to withdraw from aciclovir treatment due to reversible renal failure. Pharmacological Very few of the RCTs showed an overall beneficial effect. Antidepressants Two po or quality RCTs of phenelzine and fluoxetine, and a good quality RCT of moclobemide reported no effects of treatment either on symptoms of depression or on any of the other outcome measures reported. A good quality RCT of fluoxetine combined with graded e xercise therapy also showed no effect on depression or other measured outcomes. One controlled trial of selegiline reported some positive effects of treatment but found no overall effect. xCorticosteroids Four reasonable quality RCTs assessed the effects of steroid treatment. Two RCTs of fludrocortisone reported no effect of treatment, two of hydrocortisone found some beneficial effect of treatment. Anticholinergic agents A poor quality RCT of sulbutiamine reported no effect of treatment. One tri al which assessed galanthamine hydrobromide, presented results as within group differences and no conclusion regarding the effect of treatment can be drawn from this trial. Other pharmacological agents One trial which assessed the growth hormone Genotr opin presented results as within group differences and no conclusion regarding the effect of treatment can be drawn from this trial. One poor quality RCT showed an overall beneficial effect of oral nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Adverse eve nts serious enough to cause people to withdraw from the study occurred with fludrocortisone, moclobemide, sulbutiamine, galanthamine hydrobromide, phenelzine RCTs of essential fatty acids reported some benefic ial effects of the intervention and one also found an overall beneficial effect. Magnesium supplements were found to have an overall beneficial effect in one good quality, but small RCT. One poor quality RCT and one controlled trial evaluated general su pplements. The controlled trial reported no significant effect of treatment, but the RCT reported an overall beneficial effect. One poor quality RCT of liver extract reported no beneficial effects. The RCT of magnesium supplements reported that two par ticipants left the intervention group after experiencing a generalised rash and the other studies did not report adverse effects. Complementary/alternative Alternative therapies were evaluated in three poor quality RCTs and one controlled trial. An overall beneficial effect of massage therapy was found in one small RCT. Two RCTs assessed the effectiveness of homeopathy; one found a positive effect and the second reported overall beneficial effects. A very poor controlled trial of osteopathy found overall beneficial effects. There were no reports of adverse events from the interventions in any of these studies. Other A good quality RCT reported overall beneficial effects of treatment with a combination of drugs depending on the specific symptoms of each p atient. An overall beneficial effect was found in two controlled trials of two different multi -treatment approaches, one of which included CBT and one of which was based on providing information and advice. However, the methodological quality of both the se studies was very poor. A controlled trial of a buddy/mentor programme found a beneficial effect for one of the seven outcomes investigated; this study scored poorly on the validity assessment and only included 12 participants. Conclusions Overall the i nterventions demonstrated mixed results in terms of effectiveness. All conclusions about effectiveness should be considered together with any methodological inadequacies of the studies. Interventions for which there is evidence of effectiveness from RCTs include CBT and GET. In some of the included studies, bed or wheelchair restricted patients have been excluded and only one study included young people under 18 years of age, which raises questions about the applicability of findings to all people wit h CFS/ME. Further research is needed into (i) how subgroups of patients may respond differently to treatments and (ii) the potential additive or combined effects of treatments where more than one therapy is used. The large number of outcome measures used makes standardisation of outcomes a priority for future research. Future research needs to combine scientific rigour with patient acceptability and good quality research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of a range of interventions including pacing , ideally in comparison with CBT and GET. 1 1. BACKGROUND Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) consists of a range of symptoms including fatigue, headaches, sleep disturbances, difficulties with concentration and muscle pain. The defining characteristic has been reported to be debilitating fatigue.3-5 Children and adults present with similar symptoms.6 Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) is sometimes reported to be a separate syndrome from CFS, characterised by muscle weakness, pain and neurological disturbance.7 It has been suggested that CFS and ME are part of a group of similar symptom complexes such as postviral fatigue syndrome and neurasthenia.4 ME is sometimes diagnosed among people with these symptom complexes in the UK but is not commonly diagnosed in other countries, such as the USA.8 However in the research literature CFS is commonly referred to as being the same illness as ME, post viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS) and all similar symptom complexes. Whilst the revi ew authors are aware of the controversy over the separation or otherwise of CFS, ME and other symptom complexes, it is not within the scope of this systematic review to determine whether CFS, ME and all other similarly named symptom complexes represent the same condition. The scope of this review was to evaluate interventions for the management of CFS/ME. Therefore, unless specifically named symptom complexes were addressed, CFS/ME is the term used throughout this review, in keeping with the brief given by the Department of Health. The cause of CFS/ME remains unknown although various hypotheses have been suggested that include one or more of the follpwing factors: immunological, viral, psychological and neuroendocrine. Diagnosis is based entirely on sympto ms reported by the patient. Definitions commonly used tend to be research criteria, and there are several available (see DEC Report No 50 for a list9). Two frequently used definitions for CFS are the UK (Oxford) criteria3 and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria.4 Both state that debilitating fatigue must be present for at least six months, that there is some functional impairment, and that these have not been caused by any other identifiable clinical condition. The definitions differ however in the number and severity of other symptoms which must be present (see Table 1.1). A different set of criteria are sometimes used to diagnose ME, for example, the Dowsett criteria7 or the London criteria (unpublished)10 which are more stringent than the CFS criteria. In practice a clinical assessment is used which aims to increase the probability of a correct diagnosis of CFS/ME and to rule out other condi tions.11 This involves taking a full clinical history, a mental health evaluation, sleep evaluation and a physical evaluation. It is recommended that a series of basic screening tests be undertaken to exclude other conditions that can pr esent as fatigue.11 Estimates of prevalence vary, and may be attributed to the diversity in diagnostic criteria (more stringent criteria result in a lower prevalence estimate) and to variations in the extent to which alternative medical and psychiatric diagnoses are excluded. One small study in the UK reported that the point prevalence of CFS was 0.6% (95% confidence interval 0.2 - 1.5%), using the Oxford Criteria for diagnosis. 12 A larger UK study reported a prevalence ranging from 0.5%, when comorbid psychological disorders were excluded, to 2.6% when they were not.13 Most commonly, onset is reported to be early twenties to mid -forties.11 It is reported to be approximately twice as c ommon in women as in men, affects all social classes to a similar extent and affects all ethnic groups.11 Based on an estimate of adult population prevalence of 0.4%, the CFS/ME Working Group reported that a general practice with a popul ation of 10,000 patients is likely to have 30 -40 patients with CFS/ME, about half of whom may need input from specialist services.11 It is generally recognised that prognosis is variable. Many patients improve quite quickly. However, in those who do not improve quickly, the illness can persist for a long time. The prognosis tends to be worse for severely ill patients than for less severely ill patients.11 The findings from prospective natural history studies are va ried.14 At 12 to 18 months, rates of self -reported global improvement in symptoms range from 11 -64% and rates of self reported worsening of symptoms ranged from 15 -20%. Epidemiological studies of the natural history of CFS/ME show high ra tes of spontaneous improvement. In one study15 123/226 no longer met symptom criteria for CFS after 1.5 years and in another16 65/103 had improved, but not made a full recovery, after 3.2 years. The recent CFS/ME Workin g Group Report11 stated that the provision of services specifically designed for patients with CFS/ME is limited in some areas and non -existent in others. While patients have access to the normal range of primary, secondary and tertiary c are services, few are tailored to this patient group. Specialist services for children and young people, including inpatient facilities, are limited to a few nationwide.11 Referrals from primary care are to one or more speci alists such as 2 Table 1.1 Criteria for case definitions of CFS/ME Criteria US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 1988 (CFS)5 6 months duration of fatigue Functional activity - 50% decrease in activity 6 or 8 symptoms requ ired. Physical signs sometimes required Neuropsychiatric symptoms - may be present New onset required Exclusions: Extensive list of known physical causes, psychosis, bipolar disorder, substance abuse US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 199 4 (CFS)4 6 months duration of fatigue Substantial functional impairment 4 symptoms required Cognitive or neuropsychiatric symptoms may be present New onset required Exclusions: Clinically important medical conditions, melancholic depressi on, substance abuse, bipolar disorder, psychosis, eating disorders Australia 1990 (CFS) 6 months duration of fatigue Substantial functional impairment - disruption of daily activities Post exertion fatigue No symptoms specified Cognitive o r neuropsychiatric symptoms required New onset not required Exclusions: Known physical causes, psychosis, bipolar disorder, substance abuse, eating disorders United Kingdom 1991 'Oxford criteria' (CFS)3 6 months duration of fatigue Disab ling functional impairment - affects physical and mental functioning No symptoms specified Cognitive or neuropsychiatric symptoms - may be present Definite onset required Exclusions: Known physical causes, psychosis, bipolar disorder, eating disorder, orga nic brain disease, substance abuse Other psychiatric disorders (depressive illness, anxiety disorders) are not reasons for exclusion Dowsett (ME) 19907 Complaint of general or local muscular fatigue following minimal exertion with prolong ed recovery time Neurological disturbance, especially of cognitive, autonomic and sensory functions Variable involvement of cardiac and other systems, a prolonged relapsing course Syndrome commonly initiated by respiratory and/or gastro -intestinal infectio n but an insidious or more dramatic onset following neurological , cardiac or endocrine disability London Criteria, 199410 All of the following three criteria must be present: 1. Exercise -induced fatigue precipitated by trivially small exert ion (physical or mental) relative to the patient's previous exercise tolerance 2. Impairment of short -term memory and loss of powers of concentration, usually coupled with other neurological and psychological disturbances such as emotional disability, nominal dysphasia, disturbed sleep patterns, disequilibrium or tinnitus 3. Fluctuation of symptoms, usually precipitated by either physical or mental exercise These symptoms should have been present for at least 6 months and should be ongoing general physicians, immunologists, neurologists, haematologists and psychiatrists. The CFS/ME Working Group Report suggests that the lack of locally -based specialist services may be a problem for patients, who need access to services yet are unable to reach them, and for c ommissioners who wish to reduce the cost of out -of-area treatments.11 A variety of interventions have been used in the treatment and management of CFS/ME. Evaluations of the effectiveness of different approaches suggest a variety of diffe rent outcomes and currently a number of interventions are used in the management of CFS/ME. Whilst there is some lack of agreement about management strategies, there is also considerable agreement on elements of these, even if terminology may convey otherw ise (personal communication). The CFS/ME Working Group Report11 identified three therapeutic strategies as potentially beneficial: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), graded exercise therapy (GET), and pacing. The evidence for CBT and GET comes from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) whilst that for pacing comes from patient reports and clinical experience. The report called for more research, particularly into pacing. The variable course of CFS/ME suggests that any investigation of treatment or management of the condition should include an untreated control group.17 The subjective nature of many of the outcomes 3 used suggests a high risk of measurement bias, and good quality studies will have taken measures to avoid such bias by adopting practices such as blinding. It has been suggested that within CFS/ME subgroups may exist and that the illness takes a different course in those with CFS/ME of sudden onset than in those whose illness developed gradually, in child ren than in adults, and in those with certain 'bio -markers'. Other sub -groups may include those with severe and seemingly unremitting disease and disability. 4 2. OBJECTIVES The aim of this systematic review is to assess the effectiveness of all available interventions which have been evaluated for use in the treatment or management of adults and children with CFS/ME. In particular, the following questions were addressed: What evidence is there for the effectiveness of available interventions for CFS/ME among adults and children? What is the evidence that sub -groups of patients respond differently to treatments? What is the evidence for additive or combined effects of treatments where more than one therapy is used? 5 3. METHODS 3.1 Advisory panel A panel o f relevant experts, including topic experts, practitioners and potential users of the review were identified and recruited. They were asked for input at various stages of the review process and in particular for comment on the review protocol, and draft r eport. (See Appendix G for a list of the panel members). 3.2 Search strategy Individual search strategies were developed for each electronic database searched. The following databases were searched: MEDLINE (1966 to July 2001 ), EMBASE (1980 to July 2001 ), PsycINFO (1887 to August 2001), ERIC (1966 to August 2001), CCCTR (2002 issue 2), Social Science Citation index (1981 -August 2001), Science Citation Index (1981 -August 2001), Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings (1982 -1999), PASCAL (1973 - Augu st 2001), MANTIS (1880 - April 2000), JICST (1985 - July 2001), Conference Proceedings Index (1973 - July 2001), AMED (1984 - September 2001), NTIS (1964 - August 2001), Inside Conferences (1993 - August 2001), Life Sciences (1982 - May 2001), CAB Health ( 1983 - July 2001), BIOSIS (1969 - August 2001), TGG Health & Wellness (1976 - June 2000). Search terms included the following: chronic fatigue syndrome, myalgic, encephalomyelitis, akureyri disease, chronic epstein barr virus, cfids, chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome, chronic mononucleosis, effort syndrome, iceland* disease, low natural killer cell syndrome, neuromyasthenia, post viral fatigue syndrome, post -infectious fatigue, chronic postviral fatigue syndrome, raggedy ann* syndrome, royal free disease/epidemic/hospital disease, tapanui disease*, yuppie flu, yuppy flu and fibromyalgia (see Appendix A for an example of the search strategy used in Medline (Silverplatter)). Update searches of all the above databases, from the date on which t hey had previously been searched, were carried out in Feburary 2002. The bibliographies of retrieved articles were scanned for any additional references. In addition, web searching was carried out using Copernic 2000, which is a meta -search engine used t o scan a number of individual search engines all at the same time (e.g. Lycos, alta vista, etc). A dedicated web-site was set up for the review ( http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd/cfs.htm ) through which a dditional references could be submitted. The advisory panel was contacted and asked to submit any references which they thought might meet inclusion criteria for the review. 3.3 Inclusion criteria All papers which met the inclusion criteria (see below) were included in the review, regardless of language of publication. The following inclusion criteria were used to select studies: Interventions Any intervention used in the treatment or management of CFS/ME, compared to placebo, inactive control, or no t reatment. Participants Adults and children with a diagnosis of CFS/ME based on any criteria. The symptoms of CFS/ME show considerable overlap with those of clinical depression, fibromyalgia, neuromuscular diseases and chronic pain. For inclusion in thi s review however, individuals must have a diagnosis of CFS/ME, or other syndrome which has similar criteria for diagnosis such as chronic fatigue immune deficiency syndrome or chronic epstein barr virus infection. Outcomes All outcomes reported in the stu dies were considered relevant to reflect the wide range of medical and psychosocial outcomes used as markers of treatment response ( e.g. fatigue, pain, mood, physical functioning, quality of life, acceptability of the treatment, possible side effects, empl oyment/return to employment, consumption of health service resources). This was in response to the recommendations made by several members of the expert panel. Type of studies Study designs eligible for inclusion were randomised controlled trials (RCTs ), controlled trials or systematic reviews of RCTs or controlled trials. 6 Two reviewers independently assessed all titles and abstracts identified from the literature searches for relevance. All retrieved studies were independently assessed by two revie wers for possible inclusion. If the two reviewers could not agree, a third reviewer was consulted to resolve the differences. 3.4 Validity assessment Validity assessment was carried out, using an existing validity assessment tool,18 by one reviewer and checked by a second, using the following predefined criteria: Method of randomisation (randomised studies only) Aadequate concealment of allocation (randomised studies only) Baseline comparability of groups Degree of adjustment for confou nding factors (controlled studies only) Appropriateness of the control group i.e. whether the control group was taken from the same population as the intervention group (controlled studies only) Blinding of participants and/ or investigators Completeness of follow -up Handling of drop -outs and missing data (intention -to-treat analysis) Objectivity and blinding of outcome assessment Appropriateness of the statistical analysis Whether the groups were treated identically other than the named interventions Sample size/ statistical power Discrepancies were resolved by discussion or, when agreement could not be reached, by consultation with a third reviewer. 3.5 Data extraction Study details were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer onto a Microsoft Access database. Discrepancies were resolved by referral to the original studies. If necessary arbitration was by a third reviewer. Data from systematic reviews were extracted onto the form used to abstract systematic reviews included on the DARE database ( http://agatha.york.ac.uk/darehp.htm) . Data extracted included: Author, year Study design Intervention details (including drug dose or intensity of intervention, frequency, duration, cont ent, information about person/s delivering the intervention including any relevant training they were given, setting, whether group or individual intervention, co -interventions, details of control and study duration and length of follow -up). Stated purpose of intervention Duration of follow -up Number of participants in each intervention arm Participant details: Diagnostic criteria and any additional details Inclusion criteria Baseline functioning Whether the study was conducted with adults or children Sub-groups investigated Concurrent diagnoses Duration of illness Total number of participants Age Sex Other reported details Drop -outs in each group including reasons for withdrawal Results, including the outcome measures used, the baseline and final levels of each outcome in control and treatment groups, if stated, adverse effects, and any other details of results, such as whether significant differences were detected between the groups (including p -values if stated). Additional comments 7 3.6 Data synthesis A narrative synthesis was undertaken due to the significant heterogeneity between studies in interventions and outcomes. Results of RCTs and controlled trials were reported separately, and a distinction was made between those studies which focused on CFS and those which focused specifically on ME or other named syndromes. All of the outcomes reported in the included studies were described. Outcomes were grouped together (in tables) into the following five categories to make results easier to interpret: Resource use (e.g health service resource use) Physical (e.g fatigue, disability, exercise, activity) Physiological (e.g. immune outcomes, laboratory measurements) Psychological (e.g anxiety, cognitive function, depression, mood) General health and quali ty of life (e.g. employment, quality of life, symptom measures) A distinction was made between clinical (resource use, physical, psychological, general health and quality of life) and physiological outcome measures. Physiological measures included meas ures of fatty acid concentration, immune outcomes, and laboratory measures (for a full list of physiological outcome measures reported by the included studies see section 4.3.4). The distinction was made because physiological changes may occur as a resul t of the intervention, e.g. changes in immunological cell counts, but have no clinical benefit to the patient. The interventions were categorised into the following seven groupings: Behavioural Immunological Antiviral Pharmacological Supplements Comple mentary/Alternative Medicine Other The rationale for evaluating each intervention was briefly described, and study results in the text were reported as individual studies grouped by intervention category. A further table was produced summarising the resu lts for each intervention type by each outcome group. To provide an overall estimate of whether each study found a positive, negative or no effect of the intervention each study was classified according to two separate methods: whether the study showed any effect of treatment, and whether it showed any overall effect. Studies were judged to show some effect of treatment if any of the outcomes measured showed a statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups. Studies were classified as having an overall effect (positive or negative) if they showed a statistically significant effect for more than one clinical (i.e. not a physiological) outcome or, if only one clinical outcome was measured, it was found to show a statisticall y significant effect. The effect was considered to be positive if the intervention group showed a greater improvement than the control group, and negative if the control group showed the greater improvement. Where no statistically significant differences occurred, this was classified as showing no effect. Where studies presented their findings as within group differences rather than as differences between the intervention and control group, these results are presented but are not included in the synthes is of results and should be treated with caution. Results from trials which included subgroups, or which assessed potential additive effects of interventions, were presented in a separate section in the text, but not presented separately in associated tab les. The inclusion criteria and baseline functioning of participants in each study were used as an indicator of the severity of illness. These were discussed narratively as insufficient data were available for further analysis. Bar charts were produced to investigate any association between duration of treatment/follow -up and diagnostic criteria, and the effect (positive, negative or no effect) of the intervention on outcomes, as classified above (any effect and overall effect). Study drop -outs, and reasons for withdrawing from studies were discussed separately for each intervention type. Pie charts showing the distribution of outcomes, interventions and diagnostic criteria were produced. The validity of the included studies was assessed as described in section 3.4. For each criterion studies scored 0 for 'not stated' or 'poor', 1 for 'adequate' and 2 for 'good' (or, alternatively, 0 for 'not stated', 0 for 'no' and 1 for 'yes', for the measures of participant and investigator blinding). The 8 maximum potential score for each study was 20 points (RCTs were not assessed for 'controlling for confounding' or 'appropriateness of control group', and controlled studies were not assessed for 'method of randomisation' or 'concealment of treatment allocation'). The validity score was included in all results tables to allow the results to be considered alongside the quality of the study. The proportion of possible points scored for each validity criterion was calculated by adding the points across each variabl e (e.g. total points scored by all studies for method of randomisation), dividing by the total possible number of points (e.g. for randomisation - number of studies multiplied by 2 - total number of points available for that category), and multiplying by 1 00 to make a percentage. A bar chart was produced showing the distribution of scores for each validity criterion, separately for RCTs and controlled trials. This allows a visual assessment of the validity criteria which were most frequently fulfilled and which were not. The association of validity score with study outcome was assessed. RCTs were divided according to study outcome as described above (any effect and overall effect). Study validity score was plotted against the proportion of RCTs which scored at least that score. This was not done for controlled trials due to the small number included. 3.7 Publication bias Every effort was made to negate the effects of publication bias (the tendency for studies which show certain results, usually be neficial effects, to be published). Unpublished studies were searched for. Duplicate publications were actively screened for and, where found, the latest or most complete report was included. The review reports all duplicate publications found to enabl e future reviewers in this area to spot duplicate reports easily (see Appendix F). Insufficient data were available to assess publication bias using standard methods (e.g. funnel plots), and it was therefore discussed narratively. 9 4. RESULTS 4.1 Genera l results A total of 368 studies meeting relevance criteria were identified through the literature searches. Of these 46 met the inclusion criteria: 38 RCTs and eight controlled trials, eleven of the RCTs used a cross -over design, although for one of the se results are only available for the first section of the study and so this study is treated as a non -crossover RCT.19 Of these studies, 36 included participants diagnosed with CFS only, one included patients who fulfilled criteria for b oth CFS and ME,20 one included patients diagnosed with ME,21 and one included participants diagnosed with fibromyalgia, all but three of whom also had CFS.22 The remaining seven included participants with syndromes that had similar symptoms to CFS and ME, including post -infectious fatigue syndrome. A systematic review of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)23 also met the inclusion criteria. The trials included in this review24-26 are included individually in the results below. The results of the systematic review are presented in Appendix C and are not discussed further. Within the 46 included studies, a total of 32 different interventions have been evaluated using 38 different outcomes, with a total of 132 outcomes evaluated. In addition to the differences in interventions and in outcomes there was also heterogeneity between studies in terms of quality. Formal pooling of results and investigation of heterogeneity was n ot possible and a narrative synthesis is presented below. This review had 3 objectives: 1. What evidence is there for the effectiveness of available interventions for CFS/ME among adults and children? 2. What is the evidence that sub -groups of patients respon d differently to treatments? 3. What is the evidence for additive or combined effects of treatments where more than one therapy is used? Objective 1 is addressed in the results section below, objective 2 is discussed in section 4.4.9 and objective 3 in secti on 4.4.8. 4.2 Study participants Of the 46 included primary studies, 34 were carried out with adults, one with children, two with both adults and children and the remaining nine did not give this information. Nineteen studies gave the age range of par ticipants which ranged from 11 to 87 years. In 32 studies the participants' mean age was reported and was from 15.3 to 47 years. Four studies did not state the age of the participants included in the review. All except one of the studies that reported on the sex of study participants (n=33) included both men and women, and one study was conducted with women only.27 Overall, the percentage of women was generally higher than men with a range of 19 to 100% and a mean of 71%. The number of participants included in each trial ranged from 11 to 326, with a total of 2943 participants included in the 46 trials combined. Thirty -seven of the 46 studies included some information about duration of illness. In 22 studies the range was presented , which was from 27 days to 34 years. Thirty four studies gave the mean duration of illness which was from 27 months to 13 years. Seven studies gave information about concurrent diagnoses. One study reported that nine participants had a history of psy chiatric illness,28 in another 75% of participants had major depression,26 in another 64%29 had a current psychiatric condition, and in a fourth, all participants had neurally mediated hypotension.30 The fifth study stated that of 60 participants five had a diagnosis of dysthymia, nine had major depression, three had anxiety disorders and six had both depression and anxiety disorders.24 In the sixth study, 23 of 52 partic ipants had illnesses which included asthma, epilepsy, arthritis, ulcers, diverticulitis, hiatus hernia, sinusitis and kidney infections. The seventh study included participants who met diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia; all but three patients also met criteria for CFS and so this study has been included. Fourteen studies reported that illness onset followed an 'acute infectious disease -like episode' in the majority of participants. One study stated explicitly that participants were permitted to take other medication, including anti -depressants, in addition to those medications under investigation in the trial.31 It did not state what medications were taken concomitantly and whether there were differences in medication use between the two groups, thus other medication use could have confounded the results of this study. One study stated that all participants were prescribed certain nutritional supplements and medications to aid sleep, where necessary.22 Three studie s denied participants all 10 medication other than those under investigation.28,32,33 In 15 other trials specific medications were permitted or excluded while other studies do not report on concomitant medication usage. Details of participa nts' baseline functioning were reported in 30 trials, although the amount of information provided varied widely and so it is difficult to draw any conclusions regarding overall baseline functioning across studies. None of the studies stated whether the pa rticipants were in relapse or remission. Inclusion criteria applied by several of the studies limited the participants to those able to travel to the study centre for treatment (n=8), those who scored above or between certain levels on some measure of CF S symptoms (n=4), and those who did not have psychiatric illnesses (n=15), such as depression. 4.3 Outcomes reported in included studies A wide variety of outcomes were assessed in the 46 studies included in the review. Even where the same outcome was us ed to assess the same intervention, almost invariably a different scale or type of measurement was used, making it difficult to synthesise results across studies. Some studies assessed many outcomes making it possible that any statistically significant dif ferences between groups were due to chance, rather than to the effectiveness of the intervention over control conditions. Some results were presented as actual values, some as percentages and some as changes from pre - treatment status. Four studies pres ented the results of statistical tests not as between -group differences, as appropriate, but as within -group differences i.e. difference in before - and after - treatment values.29,34 -36 These results are presented but are not included in th e synthesis of results and should be treated with caution. Members of the expert panel were consulted about the outcomes they considered to be the most important. It was decided that all outcomes were equally important and thus the results of all outcome s have been reported. The outcomes presented were grouped into five broad categories, which are outlined in table 4.1. Table 4.1 Outcome categories Outcome (number of outcomes) Number of different measurements used Psychological (9) 25 Physical (13) 52 Quality of life/ General health (10) 43 Physiological (5) 10 Resource use (1) 2 Figure 4.1 shows the relative distribution of the outcomes used grouped into the five categories outlined above.

Interventions were grouped into seven broad categories as outlined in table 4.2. The relative distribution of the interventions, grouped as outlined below, is shown in figure 4.2. Table 4.2 Intervention categories Intervention Number of studies Behavioural 6 Immunological 8 Antiviral 4 Pharmacological 12 Supplements 6 Complementary/alternative 4 Other 4 Immunological and behavioural 1 Pharmacological and behavioural 1 Figure 4.2 Distribution of interventions Due to the heterogeneity between interventions and outcomes it was not possible to pool data from individual studies, instead studies are groupe d together by intervention type. Within each broad intervention category a brief description of the various interventions, the rationale given for their use (taken mainly from the included studies), together with a summary of the effects are presented. Results of all studies grouped by intervention are presented in tables 4.3 -4.9, and more detailed descriptions and results for each study are presented in Appendix B. All study results should be considered in relation to the methodological quality assessm ent. 4.4.1 Behavioural interventions a. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) - rationale CBT is a collaborative approach which aims to reduce levels of disability and symptoms associated with CFS/ME. Treatment components which should be tailored may i nclude: Record keeping in order to monitor the condition and understand it better Gradually resuming activitites which were previously too difficult Establishing a sleep routine Treating any associated anxiety or depression Making lifestyle changes which m ay have contributed to the development of the condition Monitoring throughts and changing any unhelpful ideas which may be hampering progress with treatment.37 Behavioural Immunological Antiviral Pharmacological and behavioural 16 b. Graded exercise therapy (GET) - rationale GET is a form of structured and s upervised activity management that aims for gradual but progessive increases in aerobic activities such as walking or swimming.11 The initial programme is deigned in collaboration with the patient, based on current capability. The dura tion/intensity of exercise is gradually increased under the supervision of a trained professional. Small, usually weekly incremental increases are jointly agreed, depending on progress. The aim of GET is to increase fitness, strength, stamina and the gra dual uptake of previously avoided activites. Main results of behavioural intervention trials (Table 4.3) Recommendations about the use of behavioural interventions such as CBT can be misinterpreted when the perceived suggestion is that CFS/ME is a psychol ogical condition. However, conclusions about the cause of the condition should not be drawn from the fact that certain therapies may be effective. Behavioural interventions, and CBT in particular, have been used effectively in other physical illnesses, such as heart disease38 and chronic low back pain.39 Four RCTs evaluated weekly or biweekly sessions of CBT. A controlled trial of 'modified CBT' used a different form of treatment without graded activity, which is norm ally considered an integral part of CBT. The intervention used in this study aimed to promote shared coping through relaxation training and guided imagery, cognitive therapy techniques and behavioural prescription involving activity limitations.29 All studies included people with CFS. CBT was compared to routine medical care in one RCT,25 to relaxation in a second RCT,24 to natural course (control) in a third RCT,40 and to guided suppor t in the controlled trial of 'modified CBT'.29 A fourth RCT compared four groups: CBT plus placebo injections; CBT plus leukocyte extract (a fraction of blood containing white blood cells); a control clinic plus leukocyte extract; and a control clinic plus placebo injections.26 Participants who received combined leukocyte extract and CBT showed a significantly greater improvement in general health than the other three groups. No significant differences were found betwe en groups (including CBT alone) for the other outcomes investigated.26 The controlled trial of modified CBT reported within group rather than between group differences.29 This study scored very poorly on the validity assessment, scoring only 1 out of a possible 20. The remaining three RCTs reported an overall beneficial effect of CBT when compared to control groups.24,25,40 All three RCTs found a significant short -term improvement in physical funct ioning, general health and fatigue. Neither of the two studies that assessed depression found any significant differences between groups.24,25 One of these RCTs also followed patients for five years after the intervention.24,41 At five year follow -up global improvement was significantly greater in the intervention group, as was the mean number of hours worked per week and the proportion of participants who completely recovered (the definition of 'completely recovered' w as based on fatigue and physical functioning scores as well as UK (Oxford) CFS criteria).41 However, no significant differences were reported between the groups for physical functioning, fatigue, general health, symptoms, relapses or the p roportion of participants that no longer met the UK (Oxford) criteria for CFS. Two RCTs of CBT in primary care are reported to be ongoing.42,43 The effects of GET were investigated in three fairly large RCTs of patients with CFS, two of which found overall beneficial effects.44,45 One found some beneficial effects.46 Significant improvements in measures of physical function were found in all three RCTs.44-46 Two also showed a signifi cant improvement in general health and fatigue44,45 and one in physiological measurements and symptoms.44 When exercise was combined with fluoxetine there was no additional effect.46 One RCT assessed dif ferent interventions to encourage graded exercise and found significant benefits of GET compared to standardised medical care for all outcomes investigated. However, there were no significant differences between the different intervention groups for any of the outcomes investigated. 45 In one RCT two participants dropped out of the CBT group as they felt a deterioration in their symptoms was due to the intervention.25 A second reported drop -out rates of around 20 - 35% i n all three intervention groups.40 Drop -out rates were highest in the CBT group and lowest in the control group, reasons for drop -outs were not stated and no adverse effects from treatment were reported. In one of the RCTs evaluating G ET, one participant dropped out from each group due to worsening of symptoms.44 In another RCT of exercise (and exercise plus fluoxetine), 11 participants dropped out due to side effects but it is unclear which intervention group they wer e in.46 17 Table 4.3 Results of behavioural intervention trials Results Intervention Author (year), number of participants Resource use Physical Psychological Physiological Quality of life and general health Drop -outs/adverse effects Validity score Deale (1997)24 n=60 Physical functioning and fatigue (assessor and patient rating): greater improvement in treatment than control (p<0.01) Depression: No significant differences in change between groups Work and social adjustment, long term goals, self -rating of global improvement, patient satisfaction with treatment outcome and proportion employed: greater improvement in treatment than control (p<0.05) General health questionnaire, patient assessment of usefulness of treatment: no significant differences in change between groups Results at 5 year follow - up41 n=53 Physical functioning and fatigue: no significant difference between two groups Global improvement and proportion completely recovered: greater improvement in treatment than control (p<0.001) General health and proportion that no longer meet UK CFS criteria: no significant differences between groups Symptoms and relapses: suggestion of greater improvement in treatment than control (p=0.05) 7 dropped out, 3 from CBT, no adverse effects reported 18 Lloyd (1993)26 n=90 Physical capacity & functional measure : no significant differences between groups Mood : no significant differences between groups Immune outcomes : no signific ant differences between groups General health : group in which DLE combined with CBT showed greater improvement than other intervention groups (p<0.05) 2 participants dropped, however, no participants dropped out due to adverse effects 13 Sharpe (1998)25 n=60 Physical functioning, interference with activities, number of days in bed, exercise and fatigue: greater improvement in treatment than control (p<0.05) Depression and anxiety: no significant differences between groups (p>0.05) Impro vement in work status, global improvement: greater improvement in treatment than control (p<0.001) Illness beliefs: greater proportion of patients in treatment group reported reduction in strength of illness beliefs (p<0.05).

Immunoglobulin G - rationale Immunomodulatory therapy with high dose intravenous immunoglobulin G (an antibody fraction of blood) has been suggested to be of use in a number of diseases featuring disordered immunoregulation.51 It has been argued that intravenous immunoglobulin G could provide potential benefit to participants with CFS in two possible ways: e ither by providing neutralising antibodies against persistent viral antigens or by analogy with its efficacy in autoimmune disorders by correcting immunoregulatory disturbances.48,52 Immunoglobulins are blood products and there are known risks associated with the use of these, such as the possible transfer of infectious diseases. b. RNA drug (ampligen) - rationale Bistranded RNAs are bifunctional molecules with both antiviral and immunomodulatory activities. Poly(I).poly(C12U) (ampligen) , a specifically configured RNA drug has generally been well tolerated clinically and thus is thought to be safe to administer on a long -term basis.53 c. Leukocyte extract - rationale Dialysable leukocyte extract is a component of leukoc ytes that is capable of transferring delayed -type hypersensitivity in humans. This agent has been used therapeutically in participants with disorders in which a defect in cell -mediated immunity has been established, such as leprosy and chronic mucocutaneo us candidiasis. In contrast to intravenous immunoglobulin, dialysable leukocyte extract is relatively inexpensive, can be administered by intramusuclar injection and is reported to have minimal adverse effects.26 d. Staphylococcus tox oid vaccine - rationale Staphylococcus toxoid vaccine may have the potential to stimulate the immune system.27 e. Antihistamine (Oral terfenadine) - rationale An association between allergy and CFS has been suggested, and there are anecd otal reports of the symptoms of CFS improving in participants using antihistamine to treat their concomitant allergies.50 Terfenadine was selected as the antihistamine of choice because of its reported absence of central nervous system si de effects. Main results of immunological treatment trials (Table 4.4) Five RCTs investigated the effects of immunoglobulin G, four in people diagnosed with CFS and one in people diagnosed with chronic mononucleosis syndrome.54 Four fou nd some positive effect, two of which found an overall positive effect, and the fifth found no effect of treatment. One RCT found significantly greater improvements in the intervention group on symptom scores and functional capacity but not in depression, immune outcomes or quality of life.51 A second smaller RCT found significantly improved immune measurements (physiological outcome) but not functional or symptom measures.48 A larger RCT reported significantly improved f unctional capacity, which was the only outcome investigated.55 A fourth RCT, which was the largest of the immunoglobulin G trials, found no significant improvement in any of the outcomes investigated (functional status, mood, immune outco mes and quality of life).52 The fifth small RCT was found to significantly improve general health (the only outcome investigated).54 The effects of ampligen were investigated in one relatively large (n=92) RCT, which repo rted significant improvements in functional ability, activity, exercise, cognitive function and work measures but not in depression scores.53 In the same RCT, elective use of other medications by participants increased significantly in th e placebo group compared to the intervention group. One RCT assessed the combined effect of leukocyte extract and CBT using a factorial design.26 A significant improvement in general health was reported for the group which received both interventions, compared to the other groups. No beneficial effects were reported for physical and functional capacity, mood or immune outcomes for any of the groups in this study. A third RCT evaluated the antihistamine terfenadine and found no significan t effects of the intervention compared to control.50The effects of vaccination with staphylococcus toxoid were investigated in one small controlled trial of patients with CFS. No significant differences were reported in depression, pain or psychological outcomes between the 20 intervention and control group. However, a significantly greater improvement in the clinical global impression in the treatment group was found.27 Some severe adverse effects were noted in participan ts in the immunological intervention groups. Two people withdrew from immunoglobulin G treatment due to severe constitutional symptom reactions.52 One recipient of immunoglobulin G therapy also withdrew due to mild but transient liver failure51 and phlebitis has also been noted with immunoglobulin G infusions.51 It should be noted that immunoglobulins and leukocyte extract are blood products. There are known risks associated with the use of blood pr oducts such as the possible transfer of infectious diseases. 4.4.3 Anti -viral a. Interferon - rationale Alpha interferon has potent immunomodulatory and antiviral effects and has been used in the treatment of several tumour and viral infections, includ ing hepatitis B and C.36,49 b. Antiviral (aciclovir and ganciclovir) - rationale Aciclovir is reported to inhibit the replication of Epstein -Barr virus in vitro and in vivo. As there is a reported link between Epstein -Barr virus infecti on and CFS, it was thought possible that aciclovir or ganciclovir may be effective in the treatment of CFS, where prior Epstein Barr virus or human cytomegalovirus infection has been established.56 Main results of antiviral treatment tri als (Table 4.5) Two RCTs evaluated interferon, one of which found an overall beneficial effect, the other reported only within group differences rather than between group differences and so no conclusions can be drawn from this study.36 The RCT which reported an overall beneficial effect was very small and found that treatment led to significantly increased physical activity and recovery which remained after 8 months follow -up.49 The effect of aciclovir was investigated in one small RCT in those who fulfilled criteria for CFS and additionally had prior infection with Epstein Barr virus confirmed.56 A significant negative effect was reported for anxiety, depression and confusion with the control group s howing a greater improvement in symptoms than the treatment group, but not for the other outcomes investigated (rest, anger, vigour, fatigue, oral temperature and personal well -being). A second very small poor quality RCT of only 11 participants investig ated the effects of ganciclovir. There was a slight improvement in energy index and symptom scores for the treatment group compared to the control group but the statistical significance of these differences was not reported.19 Some seve re adverse effects were noted in participants in these trials. Three people had to withdraw from aciclovir treatment due to reversible renal failure.56 Two participants who were undergoing right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies experie nced serious pericardial bleeding in the study of ganciclovir and so the study was ended prematurely.19 21 Table 4.4 Results of immunological treatment trials Results Intervention Author (year), number of participants Resource use Physi cal Psychological Physiological Quality of life and general health Drop -outs/adverse effects Validity score Immuno - globulin G DuBois (1986)54 n=19 General health : greater improvement in treatment group compared to control (p<0.001) No participants dropped out due to adverse effects 11 Immuno - globulin G Lloyd (1990)51 n=49 Depression : no significant differences between groups Symptom measure : greater improvement in treatment group for symptom score s and functional capacity (p=0.03) QOL : no significant differences between groups 2 immunoglobulin recipients withdrew from the study, one because of mild but transient abnormal liver function tests, the other withdrew voluntarily after phlebitis had occur red with the first infusion 13 Immuno - globulin G Peterson (1990)48 n=30 Functional : no significant differences between groups Immune outcomes : IgG levels of all participants receiving IgG fell within normal range, not observed in placebo group.

Antidepressants (non monoamine oxidase inhibitors) - rationale Participants with CFS may be comorbidly depressed and so part of the rationale for the use of anti - depressants is to treat the depression associated with CFS.47 Antide pressants have also been suggested to be of benefit in treating some of the other common symptoms of CFS such as pain and sleep disorders.47 A third possible reason for treatment of CFS with antidepressants relate to their action on centr al monoaminergic transmission suggesting that they might have a direct effect on the core features of CFS.47 There is some support for the notion that abnormalities of central neurotransmitters such as serotonin are seen in CFS.47,57 The reason for the choice of specific anti -depressant was stated in one trial.58 CFS patients may tolerate first generation tricyclic antidepressants poorly because side effects include sedation and exacerbation of fatigue, thus fluoxetine was selected as it has fewer sedative and autonomic nervous system side -effects. The rationale for the choice of treatment in one of the studies differed from that of the others.59 The authors state that the symptoms of CFS are very similar to the symptoms produced by treatment with reserpine. The authors suggested that CFS was the clinical manifestation of a state of reduced central sympathetic drive via increased firing of the locus coeruleus, a state also produced by reserpine. Phenelzine decreases locus coeruleus firing and increases central sympathetic neurotransmission to sensitised receptors. Thus, if the authors' hypothesis is correct, treatment with phenelzine at doses well below those used to treat depression should relieve the symptoms of CFS. b. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors - rationale Selegiline is reported to have an experimental ability to improve cognitive performance in Alzheimer's patients and to retard age -related memory decline in animals. It was sug gested that selegiline may be effective in treating the mild cognitive impairment that exists in some patients with CFS.60 Another study used a monoamine oxidase inhibitor as the authors stated that patients with CFS closely resemble pa tients with atypical depression, a syndrome characterised by a preferential response to monoamine oxidase inhibitors.61 c. Corticosteroids - rationale It has been suggested that CFS may be associated with a down -regulated hypothalmic -pituita ry- adrenocortical axis.32,47 Given the overlap between the symptoms of Addison's disease and CFS it has been postulated that hypocortisolism may be important in the mediation of central fatigue.28 There have been sugges tions that the underactivity of the HPA axis could result from factors that are secondary to the primary aetiology of CFS, such as sleep disturbance. One possibility is that low circulating cortisol could act as a biological factor that contributes to fat igue chronicity and interacts adversely with perpetuating cognitive and behavioural processes. Thus a rise in cortisol concentrations, by treatment with hydrocortisone or fludrocortisone, might improve fatigue in patients with CFS.32,62 d. Anticholinergic - rationale It has been suggested that a dysfunction of components of the cholinergic systems is at the heart of the pathogenesis of chronic post infectious fatigue (CPIF). Sulbutiamine crosses the blood -brain barrier and plays a part in t he regulation of the cholinergic, serotonin and noradrenergic systems and enhances the metabolism of cerebral glycogen.35 e. Hormones - rationale It has been suggested that patients with CFS and adults with growth hormone deficiency show clinical similarities and there is some evidence of attenuated growth hormone responses in patients with CFS.34 f. Oral NADH - rationale It has been suggested that there may be a dysfunction of the neurocrine -endocrinologic -immunologic (NEI) network in CFS. NADH, the co -enzyme, is known to trigger energy production through ATP generation. It has been suggested that the coenzyme may replenish depleted cellular stores of ATP, thus improving fatigue and cognitive dysfunction.31 Main results of pharmacological treatment trials (Table 4.6) Antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors The effects of antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors were investigated in four RCTs and one controlled trial.58-61 RCTs of fluoxetine,58, fluoxetine with and without GET, 46 moclobemide,61 and phenelzine59 found no beneficial effects of treatment on depression or any other of the outcome 25 measure s reported. The RCT of fluoxetine also reported no difference in effect between depressed and non -depressed individuals. A small controlled trial of selegiline was associated with significantly greater improvement in tension, anxiety and vigour in the in tervention group compared to the control group, but not with functional capacity, fatigue, illness severity or symptom measures.60 Corticosteroids The effects of steroid treatment were investigated in four RCTs of participants with CFS.28,30,32,62 Two of these RCTs evaluated hydrocortisone and both reported some beneficial effect.28,32 One found a significant improvement in general health but not in activity, depression, mood or symptom measures.32 The second smaller RCT found significant improvements in fatigue, and suggested improvements in symptoms and disability, although the improvement in disability was not significant and only within group differences were reported for symptoms.28 The other two RCTs assessed fludrocortisone and did not find any statistically significant association between treatment and the outcomes investigated.30,62 Anticholinergic agents Two RCTs evaluated anticholinergic agents. One very large RCT (n=326) which included participants diagnosed with chronic post -infectious fatigue (CPIF), evaluated the anticholinergic drug sulbutiamine.63 No significant differences between groups were reported for fatigue , activity, clinical global impression and illness severity. The second investigated galanthamine hydrobromide and also found no significant effects of treatment.35 Other pharmacological agents Oral nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD H) led to a significantly greater improvement in symptoms (the only outcome investigated) in the intervention group compared to the control group in one small RCT.31 One small study assessed the growth hormone Genotropin and found no significant effect of the intervention.34 Adverse events serious enough to cause people to withdraw from the study occurred with fludrococrtison,30 moclobemide,61 sulbutiamine,63 galantha mine hydrobromide,35 phenelzine59 and fluoxetine.58 One of the expert panel has mentioned a large RCT of galanthamine hydrobromide which has not been published. We have been unable to find any result s of this trial. 4.4.5 Supplements a. Essential fatty acids - rationale It has been suggested that people with CFS may have lowered erythrocyte membrane essential fatty acids and elevated levels of saturated fatty acids compared to healthy controls.64 Serum fatty acids have been shown to fall in several acute and chronic viral infections, including AIDS and may remain persistently low, correlating with the physical malaise, after, for example, acute Epstein -Barr virus infection. These acid s also play important roles in immunity. A study in those with post viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS) states that both unsaturated and saturated fatty acids may inactivate certain viruses in vitro and inhibit their replication in vivo.65 b. Liver extract -folic acid -cyanocobalamin (LEFAC) - rationale The rationale for the use of this intervention was not stated clearly in the paper. In the discussion section of the paper the authors say that extracts of liver seem to have an in vitro effect on mono - nuclear cell function.66 c. Magnesium - rationale Many of the symptoms of CFS are reported to be similar to those of magnesium deficiency (anorexia, nausea, learning disability, personality change, weakness, tiredness, and myalgia) and it has been suggested that patients with CFS have subnormal red blood cell magnesium concentrations.67 d. General supplements - rationale There have been reports of beneficial effects from vitamin and mineral supplementation on patients diagnosed with CFS in general practice.68 Patients with CFS may have lower vitamin levels than people who do not have CFS. Candida yeast infection is often reported to be present and accordingly the normal population of colon bacteria will be reduced. A powerful supplementation programme aimed at facilitating immune system function, helping fat metabolism, improving digestion and alleviating fatigue was suggested as a possible treatment for many of the symptoms of ME.21 26 Table 4.6 Results of pharmacological treatment trials Results Intervention Author (year), number of participants Resource use Physical Psychological Physiological Quality of life and general health Drop -outs/adverse effects Validity score Phenelzine Natelson (1996)59 n=24 Functional and fatigue : no significant differences between groups Mood and depression : no significant differences between groups Illness severity and symptom score : no significant differences between groups 6 participants, all from active treatment group dropped out, 3 because of side -effects 8 Fluoxetine Vercoulen (1996)58 n=107 Fatigue : no significant differences between groups Depression : no significant differences between groups Recovery : no significant differences between groups 15% of treatment group and 4% placebo group dropped out because of side effects including skin reactions, haematoma, nausea, headache.

One RCT in patients with CFS found a significant improvement as perceived by the participants but not in general symptoms or depression.64 A slightly larger RCT trial investigated the effect of essential fatty acid supplements in those diagnosed with post viral fatigue syndrome (PVFS).65 Significant improvement (as perceived by the participants) was reported in the intervention group, along with an improvement in symptoms an d a greater shift towards normal levels of cell fatty acid concentration. Magnesium supplements led to significant improvements in measures of energy and pain, emotional reactions, general health and laboratory measures but not in sleep, physical mobility or social isolation in one small RCT of patients with CFS.67 One very small RCT assessed the effects of liver extract in patients with CFS but found no significant difference in outcomes between the intervention and control groups.66 General supplements had an ovverall beneficial effect in a very small (n=12) RCT21 but no significant effect in a small controlled trial (n=42) of patients with CFS.68 Reasons for dropping out of the stu dies were not well described in the supplement trials, however in the magnesium trial, two participants left the intervention group after experiencing a generalised rash.67 4.4.6 Complementary/alternative medicine a. Homeopathy - ratio nale Homeopathy has been used to treat all the symptoms of CFS combined as a holistic system of treatment.33 b. Massage therapy - rationale Massage therapy has been shown to reduce depression, anxiety and stress hormones in groups of depress ed individuals and it was suggested that it may have similar effects in patients with chronic fatigue immunodeficiency disorder.69 c. Osteopathy - rationale It has been suggested that ME may be caused by a mechanical dysfunction affect ing the upper back which leads to a chronic disturbance of the sympathetic nervous system.20 Such a dysfunction could be managed by biomechanical treatment, which involves manipulation of the inter -vertebral apophyseal joints of the thora cic spine and massage of the surrounding soft tissues to increase blood supply and stimulate lymphatic drainage.20 Main results of complementary/alternative medicine treatment (Table 4.8) Massage therapy significantly improved measures of fatigue, pain and sleep, depression and cortisol levels in one small RCT in those diagnosed with chronic fatigue immune deficiency syndrome (CFIDS).69 Osteopathy improved measures of fatigue, back pain and sleep, anxiety and cognitive function and general health in a controlled trial of patients diagnosed with ME. The values were reported on a graph and no indication of the significance of the difference was reported. A combined treatment measure showed significant improvements (p<0.00 5). However the quality of this study was poor (score = 0 out of 20).20 Two RCTs assessed the effectiveness of homeopathy.33,70 One study, for which only preliminary results were available, found a significant improve ment for one of the six outcomes investigated (general fatigue). The second study reported that a significantly greater proportion of the intervention group recovered compared to the control group. The authors of the second study state that participant s were suffering from ME, however the Oxford criteria for CFS were used to make the diagnosis. 4.4.7 Other a. Multi -treatment - rationale It has been suggested that CFS may be heterogeneous in nature and reflects a complex interaction between a variety of physiologic, behavioural, emotional and cognitive factors. Multi -disciplinary interventions, including appropriate medical investigations and intervention, treatment for depression and any other comorbid psychiatric disorder, nutritional supplements an d various forms of behavioural and cognitive -behavioural intervention have been proposed for managing CFS.71 b. Buddy and mentor programme - rationale It has been suggested that individuals with CFS often experience significant reductio ns in social and occupational functioning and in the ability to complete necessary daily tasks.72 The buddy/mentor 29 programme was established to try to fill the significant need of patients with CFS for social support, as a means of reduc ing stress which may inhibit recovery.72 Main results of multidimensional treatment trials (Table 4.9) One RCT investigated a multi -treatment programme in people with fibromyalgia and CFS which involved treating specific patient symptoms with a variety of different medications. All patients, in both control and intervention groups, also received nutritional supplements. The study found significant improvements in the intervention compared to the control group for all of the outcomes inves tigated. Patients in the treatment arm were found to have greater improvements in energy, sleep, mental clarity, achiness, well -being, fibromyalgia impact questionnaire, tender points and overall response to treatment compared to those in the control gro up.22 The study was good quality. One controlled trial of combination treatment (including CBT) in patients with CFS was included.71 A significantly greater number of participants returned to work in the intervention gr oup (the only outcome measured), however 49 of the 71 original participants were not followed up. This study scored very poorly on the validity assessment and so these results should be interpreted with caution. A controlled trial of 'broad -based manage ment' (mainly information and advice) in people diagnosed with post -infectious fatigue syndrome found significant improvements in the intervention group in measurements of fatigue, somatic symptoms and self -efficacy.73 Again, a low score on the validity assessment indicates that these results should be treated with caution. A very small controlled trial of a buddy/mentor programme found significant improvements in the treatment group compared to control for fatigue severity but not for an y of the other six outcomes investigated.72 30 Table 4.7 Results of supplement treatment trials Results Intervention Author (year), number of participants Resource use Physical Psychological Physiological Quality of life and general hea lth Drop -outs/Adverse effects Validity score Warren (1999)64 n=50 Depression : trend for treatment group to show greater improvement (p=0.09) Symptom measure : no significant differences between groups Participant assessment of improvement: trend for greater improvement in treatment group (p=0.09) 2 in treatment group dropped out before trial started, 5 in each group withdrew during trial, felt that they were not getting any better 16 Essential fatty acids (36mg gamma -linoleic acid E.)

One RCT which evalu ated fluoxetine and GET found no significant effect of fluoxetine either as the sole treatment or in combination with GET, although a significant beneficial effect of GET was reported for one of the outcomes investigated when used in isolation.46 The results of this RCT are presented in tables 4.3 (behavioural) and 4.6 (pharmacological). Full details are presented in Appendix B. The second RCT evaluated the combined effects of leukocyte extract and CBT.26 The results of this RCT are presented in tables 4.3 (behavioural) and 4.4 (immunological). Full details are presented in Appendix B. There were no significant differences between the groups receiving either: i) leukocyte extract and clinic treatment, ii) CBT and plac ebo or clinic treatment and iii) placebo, for any of the outcomes investigated. However, the group receiving both CBT and leukocyte extract showed a significantly greater improvement in general health than the other intervention groups but did not differ significantly for any of the other outcomes assessed. 4.4.9 Subgroups Two RCTs58,61 and one controlled trial29 assessed participants with depression or psychological distress as subgroups. One RCT of fluoxetine58 found no significant difference in response between depressed and non -depressed groups and one RCT of moclobemide61 found no significant difference between those with major depression or general psychological distress and those w ithout. One controlled trial of CBT found that those participants who were depressed (as defined by a high score on CES -D scale, using a median split of all trial participants) had greater improvements on several outcomes including depression, stress, fati gue and fatigue -related thinking than those who were not.29 The RCT of moclobemide61 also assessed participants with reduced immune responses. This subgroup showed a significantly greater improvement with moclobemide on t he Karnofsky Performance Index than those in the intervention group who did not have reduced immune responsiveness. Another RCT26 also mentioned those with reduced immune response as a subgroup but no results were presented for this subgr oup. One RCT of fludrocortisone assessed separately participants who had been ill for three years or more, versus those who had been ill for less than three years and found no significant differences in response to treatment.30 One RCT o f ampligen grouped participants according to whether they had evidence of human herpes virus 6 (HHV -6) infection. No significant differences were found between groups in response to treatment as measured by change in Karnofsky Performance Index.53 Results for subgroups are given in individual study details in Appendix B, in the 'general comments' section under 'outcomes' 4.4.10 Children One RCT of immunoglobulin G included only young people aged less than 18.55 A signif icant improvement in functional score (based on attempts and attendance at school or work and physical or social activities) was reported in the intervention group compared to the control group. Significantly more young people in the intervention group had an improvement in score of 25% or more. A second RCT of immunoglobulin G included both adults and children according to standard definitions, although no participants under the age of 16 were included.51 Significant improvements were se en in symptom scores and in functional capacity in the intervention group compared to the control group. The findings from both of these studies have also been presented in the main immunological section. Immunoglobulin is a blood product and there are known risks associated with the use of these, so the use of this treatment should be carefully considered. No trials of other interventions investigated in children were identified. However, a pilot study of CBT in children has been completed74 and a randomised controlled trial is currently in progress.75 4.5 Validity of included studies The results for individual studies and intervention categories presented above need to be considered alongside the methodological as sessment. The quality of the 38 RCTs included in this review was variable, with 29 of them (76%) scoring 10 points or more (out of 20) on the validity criteria. Overall, the controlled trials were of much poorer quality, the highest score achieved was 11 out of 20, and only two of the eight trials (25%) scored 10 points or more. 34 The results of the validity assessment for each study (separately for RCTs and controlled studies) are shown in Table 4.10 (the validity grading of studies is shown in Appendix D). The percentage of the total available points scored by the studies for each validity criterion is presented below, separately for RCTs and controlled trials, and is illustrated in figure 4.3. Validity criterion RCTs Controlled trials Objectivity and validity of outcome 92 69 Blinding (investigator) 87 25 Blinding (participant) 82 38 Appropriate analysis 80 31 Baseline comparability of treatment groups 79 38 Completeness of follow -up 78 19 Comparability of treatment of groups other than na med interventions 58 25 Method of randomisation 55 Not assessed Sample size or power calculation 49 0 Handling of drop -outs (Intention -to-treat) 38 0 Concealment of treatment allocation 29 Not assessed Appropriate control group Not assessed 38 Adjus tment for confounding factors/ baseline differences where found Not assessed 0 Most RCTs scored well on objectivity and validity of outcomes, blinding of investigators and participants, baseline comparability of groups, completeness of follow -up and appr opriate statistical analysis. RCTs generally scored poorly on concealment of treatment allocation and failed to use an intention -to-treat analysis. Controlled trials also scored well on objectivity and validity of outcomes but scored less than 40% for a ll other validity criteria. None of the controlled trials in which groups were not comparable at baseline adjusted for baseline differences or confounding factors. None of the controlled trials used a sample size calculation or an intention -to-treat analy sis. Figure 4.3 Percentage of the total available points scored for each validity criterion (separately for RCTs and controlled trials) No one intervention type scored more highly on the validity criteria than any other, although trials of GET and of essential fatty acid supplements all scored 16 points or more. It has been suggested that studies of lower quality are more likely to show a positive result. 76 To investigate this theory, the validity score for e ach RCT was plotted against the percentage of RCTs 0102030405060708090100 Outcome Blinding (investigator)Blinding (participant)Analysis Baseline comparabilityFollow-up Comparability of treatmentRandomisationSample sizeITT Allocation Control group ConfoundingPercentageRCTs Controlled trials 35 showing at least that score. This was done separately for studies that showed any effect of treatment, and for the overall treatment effect (see section 3.6 for description of methods used to classify eff ect of treatment).(Figure 4.4) If study quality made no difference to whether a positive result was reported it would be expected that the two lines (representing no effect and positive effect) would be close together. If the studies which scored poorly on validity assessment were more likely to show a positive result it would be expected that the line representing no effect would be above that indicating positive effects. Instead the graph indicates that the line representing studies which found a posit ive effect (any and overall effects) is above the line for studies showing no effect. This finding suggests that a positive effect was more likely to be reported by the studies of better quality.

Drop -out rat es by intervention group for the RCTs are shown in Figure 4.5. Figure 4.5 Percentage of drop -outs by intervention for the RCTs The highest drop -out rates for the RCTs was in the behavioural trials, where 19% (162/838) of participant s dropped out. The high drop-out rate in these trials was due largely to the high drop-out rates in one of the RCTs of CBT,40 and one of GET.46 The CBT study had a drop-out rate of 40% (37/92) in the CBT group, 32% (29/90) in the support group and 20% (18/88) in the control group. There was a significant difference in the proportion of drop-outs between the groups ( Chi\u00b2 = 8.27 p = 0.016). The GET trial had a drop -out rate of 29%, 37% in the exercise groups and 22 % in the non -exercise groups.46 The other RCTs of CBT had lower drop -out rates which ranged from 2 -12% and none of the studies reported significant differences in withdrawals between intervention and control groups. The remaining two t rials of GET also had lower drop- out rates. In one trial44 11% of participants dropped out, a percentage which was equal across the groups. In the second the intervention groups had higher drop -out rates than the control group with an o verall drop- out rate of 14%. It is possible that that the higher drop -out rates in the exercise groups are the result of the unacceptability of treatment and so it is important that the results of these studies are analysed using an intention -to-treat an alysis. The one controlled trial of CBT did not report any drop -outs.29 Trials of antiviral treatments also reported relatively high drop -out rates of 13% (11/88). All of these trials were small with samples size of 30 or less and between 2 and 4 participants withdrew from the studies. Almost all of the withdrawals occurred in the intervention groups suggesting that these types of intervention may not be acceptable to patients. The pharmacological therapy RCTs had a drop -out rat e of 12% (102/869), with four of the twelve trials reporting more withdrawals from the intervention groups. The one controlled trial of a pharmacological therapy showed a higher drop -out rate with 24% (6/25) of participants leaving the study.60 Studies in the grouping of complementary/alternative treatments also had a drop -out rate of 12%. This relatively high drop -out rate was largely due to the drop-out rate in one of the trials of homeopathy which reported a drop-out rate of 18% (1 9/104 participants).70 The other RCT of homeopathy reported a drop-out rate of 5% (3/64 participants) and the RCT of massage therapy69 did not report on trial withdrawals. The controlled trial of osteopathy recorded a significantly higher drop -out rate in the control group compared with the intervention group (17 versus 2 respectively), although the reasons for this are unclear.20 RCTs of supplements had a drop -out rate 9% (15/174). One of the trials of essential fatty acids had a high drop-out rate of 20% (10/50), however, there were equal numbers of withdrawals in the treatment and control groups. The other four studies had lower drop -out rates ranging from 5 -8%; none of these reported highe r drop-out rates in the intervention compared to control groups. The controlled trial of general supplements had a very high drop -out rate of 55% (23/42).68 19 1312 12 98 4 02468101214161820 ImmunologicalPercentage 39 In the grouping of 'other' interventions there was only one RCT, the other th ree studies were controlled trials. This RCT reported a drop -out rate of 8% (6/72), with more participants withdrawing from the intervention group compared to the placebo group, although the reasons for this do not appear to have been related to adverse effects but rather to the large number of pills to be taken.22 The controlled trial of a multidimensional intervention had the highest withdrawal rate reported by any of the trials, with 69% (49/71) of participants unavailable at the en d of the 52 week intervention.71 The other controlled trial, of broad based management, had a lower drop -out rate of 15% (8/52).73 The controlled trial of social support was very small with only 12 participants, of whic h 4 (33%) dropped out. RCTs of the remaining intervention category, immunological, showed relatively low drop -out rates of 4%. In the RCTs of immunological therapy only 22 of the total of 480 participants dropped out. Drop -out rates were only higher in the intervention than the control group for one of the 8 studies.51 The controlled trial of immunological therapy reported a higher drop-out rate of 14% (4/28), with a greater number of drop-outs in the control group. 4.7 Duration of i ntervention and follow -up The duration of intervention and follow -up varied between studies and within intervention types. In most trials the duration of intervention and follow -up was the same. Twelve of the 46 trials followed up participants for sever al weeks or months after the intervention had ceased. (Table 4.11) Seven of these trials assessed immunological or antiviral treatments, of which one also included CBT, three evaluated behavioural interventions, and two assessed pharmacological treatments . One RCT of CBT followed up participants five years post intervention; in the other eleven trials follow -up ranged from two weeks to nine months. These trials showed a mixture of no effect, some positive effects, some negative effect, and an overall pos itive effect. There are insufficient trials with longer follow -up to investigate whether there is any association between study outcome and a longer follow -up period.

Duration of intervention was longest in one RCT of alternative treatments (52 weeks) , and the average duration of the intervention was longest for the complementary/alternative therapy trials (34 weeks) and the trials of 'other' interventions (27 weeks). Behavioural interventions also had a relatively long average intervention duration of 25 weeks. The average duration of the intervention was relatively short in the immunologic and antiviral (15 weeks), supplements (11 weeks) and pharmacologic (9 weeks) treatment trials. The distribution of treatment duration by intervention grouping is shown in Figure 4.6. To investigate whether there was any association between treatment duration and study outcome, treatment duration (grouped as <1 month, 1 -<3 months, 3 -<6 months and 6 -12 months) was plotted against trial results (no effect and posi tive effect) (Figure 4.7). These figures suggest that studies with a longer treatment duration (>3 months) are more likely to report any positive effect and an overall positive effect of the intervention. However, the association between treatment dura tion and trial outcome was not significant for any effect of treatment ( Chi\u00b2 (3df) = 6.64, p = 0.084) or for the overall treatment effect ( Chi\u00b2 (3df) = 7.56, p = 0.056 ). 40 Figure 4.6 Distribution of treatment duration by intervention grouping Figure 4.7 Effect of treatment by treatment duration a.

One study used both the CDC (1988) and (1994) criteria to diagnose participants, and was classified as using CDC (1988) criteria a s these are stricter than the later criteria. Eight studies used other diagnostic criteria to diagnose people with post -viral fatigue syndrome,65 chronic fatigue immunodeficiency syndrome,69 fatigue63, post -infectious fatigue syndrome,73 chronic fatigue syndrome (diagnostic criteria not described further)72 and a main complai nt of fatigue.35 In one study the author's own criteria was used, in which two of the following three criteria had to be present for at least three months: muscle pain, mental/physical fatigue at rest or on minimal exercise, persisting/r elapsing course of illness. In addition the following two criteria had to be fulfilled: patient was well before illness, exclusion of other cause of symptoms.68 One study that diagnosed patients using CDC (1994) criteria stated that par ticipants did not have to meet the CDC criteria of 4/8 additional symptoms, however, participants did have to score above certain levels on fatigue severity and sickness impact scales.40 One study included patients with a diagnosis of CFS based on the CDC (1988) criteria and who also met the London Criteria for ME.20 One study stated that patients had CFS but gave no information on the criteria used to diagnose patients.19 One study included only patie nts who fulfilled the 1990 American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia,78 however, all but three of these patients also met the CDC (1994) criteria for CFS. Figure 4.8 Distribution of diagnostic criteria Summary effects (no effect and positive effect, for any effect and overall effect) are presented in a bar chart for each set of diagnostic criteria (Figure 4.9). 4.9 Publication bias Due to heterogeneity of outcomes and interventions it was not possible to assess the extent of publication bias using funnel plots. However every effort was made to trace unpublished studies (see 'Methods'). No trials found an overall negative effect of the intervention compared to control conditions, suggesting that there may be bias towards publication of trials showing a positive effect. 4.10 Summary of results The results of each trial grouped by intervention category, ranked according to validity score, are presented in Table 4.12. Trials were classified as having a positive, negative or no effect, under the classifications of overall effect and any effect (section 3.5). The findings from each study should be considered alongside the methodological quality. Of the 46 included trials 31 (67%) showed some beneficial effect of the intervention and of these 19 (41%) showed an overall beneficial effect, one study (3%) reported a negative effect of the intervention. Overall, of those studies that found some beneficial effect of the intervention, one study (of an immuno logical intervention) found a benefit for physiological outcome measurements only. Some studies investigated a large number of outcomes - the range across studies was from 1 to 15 - making it possible that any CDC (1988) Other Oxford CDC (1994) Australian 42 statistically significant differences could h ave arisen by chance. The results of those studies evaluating multiple outcomes should therefore be treated with caution. The results from four studies (evaluating alpha interferon,36 growth hormone,34 galanthamine hydr obromide35 and cognitive behavioural therapy29) were not included in this summary of findings as they were based on within group comparisons rather than comparisons between groups. 4.10.1 Behavioural Both CBT and GET sho wed positive results. Three24,25,40 of the four RCTs evaluating CBT found a positive overall effect of the intervention and these studies also scored highly on validity assessment. One RCT which also included immunologic therapy26 did not find overall beneficial effects of CBT. The controlled trial of CBT reported within group rather than between group differences and so conclusions cannot be drawn from the results.29 These two studies scored lower on the validity assessment, especially the controlled trial which scored 1 out of a possible 20. Two of the three RCTs of GET found an overall beneficial effect of the intervention compared to the control groups, the third found some beneficial effect of treatment. These RCTs all scored highly in the validity assessment, scoring 17 or more out of a possible 20.44-46 4.10.2 Immunological Five RCTs assessed the effects of immunoglobulin G in patients with CFS, of these two showed an overall beneficial effect,54,55 (however in both these trials only one outcome was investigated), two showed some positive effects48,51 (however, in one trial this effect was seen in physiological outcomes only,48) and one found no effect.52 Immunoglobulins are blood products so possible transfer of, for example, infectious diseases must be considered. One RCT of ampligen found an overall beneficial effect,53 and a positive effect was found in a small controlled trial of staphyloccoccus toxoid.27 A small RCT of the antihistamine oral terfenadine reported no beneficial effects.50 These three studies scored between 9 and 12 on the validity assessmen t. Figure 4.9 Effect of treatment by diagnostic criteria a. Studies classified according to whether they show any effect of treatment b. Studies classified according to whether they show an overall effect of treatment The bar chart for any effect suggests that more participants with a positive response to the intervention were diagnosed using the Oxford criteria. The bar chart for overall effect is less clear. The association between method of diagnosis and study outc ome was not significant for any effect of treatment ( Chi\u00b2 (4df) = 6.05, p = 0.195) or for the overall treatment effect ( Chi\u00b2 (4df) = 6.53, p = 0.163). 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Australian CDC 88 CDC 94 Oxford Other Diagnostic criteria Percentage of studies Positive No effect 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Australian CDC 88 CDC 94 Oxford Other Diagnostic criteria Percentage of studies Positive No effect 43 4.10.3 Antiviral Two small RCTs evaluated interferon, one of these found an overall beneficial effect49 and the other reported within group differences and so conclusions cannot be drawn from this study.36 The methodological quality of both these studies was fairly poor; scoring 6 and 11 respectively (out of a possible 20) on the validity assessment. A small RCT of aciclovir, reported a greater improvement in anxiety, depression and confusion in the control group compared to the treatment group, however, no differences in treatment effect were found for the other six outco mes investigated.56 This study scored 15 out of 20 on the validity assessment. A very small poor quality RCT of ganciclovir reported some beneficial effects of treatment but the significance of the results was not reported. This stud y was ended prematurely due to adverse events in the intervention group.19 4.10.4 Pharmacological Two poor quality RCTs of anti -depressants,58,59 and a good quality RCT of moclobemide61 reported no effe cts of treatment either on symptoms of depression or on any of the other outcome measures reported. One controlled trial of selegiline reported some positive effects of treatment but found no overall effect.60 Two RCTs of fludrocortison e reported no effect of treatment, these studies were of reasonable quality.30,62 Two RCTs of hydrocortisone reported some beneficial effects of treatment.28,32 One of these was of good quality scoring 18 out of 20,28 the other was of average quality with a score of 14 out of 20.32 A poor quality RCT of sulbutiamine63 also reported no effect of treatment. One poor quality RCT showed an overall beneficial effect of ora l NADH.31 Two studies, one of growth hormone34 and the other of galanthamine hydrobromide,35 reported within group rather than between group differences. 4.10.5 Supplements In the supplements category tw o good quality RCTs of essential fatty acids reported some beneficial effects of the intervention64,65 and one also found an overall beneficial effect.65 Magnesium supplements were found to have an overall beneficial effe ct in the one good quality RCT where these were evaluated.67 One poor quality RCT and one controlled trial evaluated general supplements, the controlled trial reported no significant effect of treatment68 but the RCT rep orted an overall beneficial effect.21 4.10.6 Complementary/alternative medicine Alternative therapies were evaluated in three poor quality RCTs and one controlled trial.33 Two RCTs looked at homeopathic treatment, one of these found an overall beneficial effect of treatment, the second found some beneficial effect of the intervention. The other small RCT looked at massage therapy and found an overall beneficial effect. All three RCTs scored poorly on the validity asse ssment scoring less than 10 out of a possible 20. A controlled trial of osteopathy found some improvements in the intervention group, but the values were estimated from graphs and so the results may not be entirely accurate.20 This stu dy scored very poorly on the validity assessment, scoring 0. 4.10.7 Other A good quality RCT found overall beneficial effects of treatment with a combination of drugs depending on the specific symptoms of each patient.22 An overall bene ficial effect was found in two controlled trials of two different multi -treatment approaches, one of which included CBT71 and one of which was based on providing information and advice.73 However, both of these studies sc ored poorly on the validity assessment. A controlled trial of a buddy/mentor programme found a beneficial effect for one of the seven outcomes investigated; this study scored poorly on the validity assessment and only included 12 participants.72 4.10.8 Children One RCT of immunoglobulin G which included only young people aged under 18 found an overall beneficial effect on two measures of functional ability.55 This study is also presented in the overall summary of result s (above). No controlled studies conducted in children were identified for any other intervention categories. 4.10.9 Subgroups Two RCTs58,61 and one controlled trial29 assessed participants with depression or psycholog ical distress as subgroups of the main diagnostic criteria. One RCT of fluoxetine58 reported no differences in response between depressed and non -depressed participants and one RCT of moclobemide found no differences between those with maj or depression or general psychological distress and those without.61 One controlled trial of CBT reported that participants who were depressed improved more than those who were not on outcomes including depression, stress, fatigue severit y and fatigue related thinking.29 In addition to depression, one study also assessed participants with reduced immune responses.61 This group were found to have a greater improvement on the Karnofsky Performance Index wi th moclobemide than those in the same group who did not have reduced immune responsiveness. 44 In another study participants were grouped according to whether they had evidence of human herpes virus 6 (HHV -6) infection. No differences were found between the two groups in response to ampligen, as measured by changes on the Karnofsky Performance Index.53 One RCT assessed participants who had been ill for three years or more, separately from participants who had been ill for less than three ye ars. The study reported no differences in response to fludrocortisone between the two groups.30 A controlled trial of broad -based management also found no differences in response between those who had been ill for shorter and longer per iods of time.73 In the same study, participants were also grouped according to degree of initial functional impairment, emotional distress, and fatigue. No differences in response were seen in those with a greater degree of initial funct ional impairment and emotional distress, however those who reported more initial fatigue showed greater improvements in self-efficacy scores.73 The categories of potential subgroups investigated in the trials was limited. For example, no studies were found which compared the effects of treatment in bed and wheelchair bound patients with those who were less restricted by their illness, or that assessed whether treatment had different effects in those where the diagnosis had been made using criteria for CFS compared with those where the diagnosis had been made using criteria for ME. 4.10.10 Combination therapies Two trials investigated the combined effects of more than one intervention.26,46 One RCT evaluated fluoxet ine and GET and found no significant effect of fluoxetine either as the sole treatment or in combination with GET, although a beneficial effect of GET on its own was reported.46 The other RCT evaluated the combined effects of leukocyte ex tract and CBT and found no significant difference between the groups receiving either: i) leukocyte extract and clinic treatment, ii) CBT and placebo or clinic treatment and iii) placebo for any of the outcomes investigated.26 The group r eceiving both CBT and leukocyte extract showed a significantly greater improvement in general health than the other intervention groups but did not show any significant differences for any of the other outcomes investigated. 4.10.11 Additional or alterna tive criteria to CFS Two trials, one RCT of massage therapy69 and one controlled trial of osteopathy,20 both found overall benefits of the intervention in those diagnosed with CFIDS (massage) and ME (osteopathy). It should be noted however that both studies were methodologically poor, and in particular the trial of massage therapy reported within -group comparisons, rather than between group differences. One very small RCT of immunoglobulin G found an overall benefit in tho se diagnosed with chronic mononucleosis syndrome.54 In another RCT some positive effects of aciclovir were reported, but there was no overall positive effect in those diagnosed with CFS who had had previous Epstein Barr virus infection.56 Essential fatty acids produced an overall beneficial effect in people diagnosed with post viral fatigue syndrome in one RCT65 and general supplements had a positive (but not an overall) effect in one RCT where participa nts were diagnosed with ME.21 A controlled trial of broad -based management found an overall beneficial effect in those diagnosed with post -infectious fatigue syndrome.73 A trial of many different medications based on sy mptomatology and laboratory tests found on overall benefit for people with fibromyalgia and CFS.22 It must be noted for some of the interventions the results are based on one or two studies, which may limit the generalisability of the fin dings. Another factor which may limit the applicability of the findings is the inclusion criteria specified in some trials. For example, in some studies participants were only eligible if they could physically get to the clinic. Those people who were un able to walk or to get out of bed were automatically excluded and so it is not possible to assess whether the interventions investigated would be effective, ineffective or even hazardous for a more severely disabled group of people. In many of the trials very limited information was given about participants who were ineligible or about the baseline functioning of many of those who were included. Therefore, it is difficult to extrapolate how the findings might transfer to other people with CFS/ME. 45 Table 4.12 Summary of study results Treatment Diagnostic criteria Duration of follow -up (weeks) Number of partici - pants Outcomes investigated Any effect Overall effect Validity score (maximum 20) BEHAVIOURAL GET44 Oxford 12 66 PH; PS; LAB; QOL GET45 Oxford 52 (26) 148 PH; PS; QOL + + 17 GET & Fluoxetine46 136 PH; PS; QOL + <> 17 Oxford 26 (and years) 60 PH; PS; QOL + + 18 CBT40 CDC PH; PS; QOL CBT25 PS; QOL + + 13 PH; PS; LAB; IMMUNOLOGICAL Immunoglobulin G55 (13) 71 PH + + 16 Immunoglobulin G48 CDC 88 21 30 PH; LAB; QOL QOL 13 19 QOL + + 11 Ampligen53 CDC 88 26 92 RU; PH; PS + + 12 Terfenadine50 CDC 88 9 30 PH; QOL <> <> 12 Staphylococcus toxoid27 CDC 94 12 28 PS; QOL + <> 9 ANTIVIRAL Alpha interferon36 CDC 88 12 30 LAB; QOL + <> 11 Interferon49 CDC 88 52 (12) 20 PH + + 6 Aciclovir56 CDC 88 18 (13) 27 PH; PS; LAB; PS; QOL + <> QOL <> <> Oral NADH31 CDC 94 12 26 QOL + + 12 Growth hormone34 CDC 94 12 20 PH <> <> 5 SUPPLEMENTS Essential fatty acids*65 Other 13 63 LAB; QOL + + 17 fatty acids*64 Oxford 13 50 PS; QOL 6 LAB; QOL + + PH; PS; QOL <> <> 10 General supplements21 Other 7 12 PH + + 6 General supplements68 Other 26 42 PH; QOL <> PS + <> 8 Any homeopathic remedy33 Oxford 52 64 QOL + + 6 Massage therapy69 Other 5 20 PH; PS; LAB + + 9 Osteopathy20 CDC 88 + London (ME) 52 58 PH; PS; QOL + + 0 OTHER Multi-treatment22 CDC 94 13 72 PH; QOL + + 19 mentor72 PS; QOL + <> 4 Combination71 CDC 94 52 71 QOL + + 3 Broad based management73 Other 26 52 PS; QOL; PH + + 2 + indicates a positive effect of treatment; indicates a negative effect of treatment; <> indicates no effect of treatment *Essential fatty acids studies) = 36mg gamma (DHA), 255mg linoleic acid (LA), plus 10 IU vitamin E.

DISCUSSION 5.1 Methodological quality of included studies The overall methodological quality of the included studies was variable. More than half of the studies scored 10 points or more on the va lidity scale (out of a maximum of 20 points). RCTs scored well on blinding of both participants and investigators, objectivity of outcome assessments and baseline comparability of groups. Controlled trials scored well on objectivity and validity of outcome s. Many of the outcomes were based on participants' self -assessment, which is subjective rather than objective, but for the outcomes being measured (level of fatigue, mood, etc) an objective assessment would not be possible or appropriate. Studies were classified as 'good' for objectivity of outcome assessment if they used a validated questionnaire to assess outcomes or used other methods considered to be appropriate. For laboratory measurements, such as immunological functioning, and physical outcomes (e.g. treadmill tests) objective measurements using blind assessors had to be used for studies to be classified as 'good'. Ten of the RCTs used a crossover design. Cross -over studies benefit from the fact that participants in both groups are identical, and so fewer participants are needed in each trial. However it can be difficult to maintain blinding in a crossover trial and validity can also be limited by the effects of one intervention persisting while the other intervention is being evaluated. Two o f the controlled trials recruited participants for the intervention group from a different population to the control group, i.e. the intervention group was constructed from people attending specialist CFS clinics and the control group from patient support organisations, or the intervention group was taken from people who had been on a waiting list for considerably longer than the control group. This is not appropriate as the groups are drawn from different populations and may not be comparable in terms of disease severity, and other factors which may affect prognosis and the apparent effect of the intervention. In some of the RCTs, both the method of randomisation and concealment of allocation were poorly reported. Intention -to-treat analysis was rarely p erformed, which limits the validity of the findings. This is a particular problem for CFS/ME as some interventions may be poorly tolerated by participants and can lead to withdrawals related to the intervention; the effect of which needs to be considered w hen assessing whether an intervention is beneficial. A major flaw in many of the included studies was in the reporting of outcomes. There was significant heterogeneity in the outcome measures used (see next section), and outcomes were often not reported fully. Mean scores on measurement scales were sometimes reported without any measures of variance such as standard deviations or standard errors of the mean. Sometimes mean scores were only reported if the difference between groups was significant. Some s tudies only reported mean scores for groups where the difference was significant for measurements made at the start of the trial compared to measurements made at the end of the trial. Where authors have reported only within -group differences rather than be tween -group differences, these have been reported in the results section and in all associated tables.34,35,69 They were not however considered in the summary results section as it is inappropriate to draw conclusions from data analysed in this way, because the event rate in the control group has not been taken into account. 5.2 Outcomes Many different outcomes, measured using a variety of different scales were reported in the studies included in this review. It was therefore not appro priate to pool data for interventions investigated in more than one trial. It also makes it difficult to compare the results of the trials in a non -quantitative analysis. Trial authors rarely included detailed information about the scales and measurements used to assess outcomes. Consequently, it is not clear whether a positive result based on one scale to measure (for example) disability is as good as, better, or worse than, a positive result on a different scale. It is also unclear what is represented in clinical terms by the divisions on each of the scales and whether these are similar and how many of these scales or measures have been validated. Some studies reported on physiological measures including measures of fatty acid concentration, immune outcomes, and other laboratory measures. These outcome measures are difficult to interpret as their relevance to disease status and clinical measures of patient symptoms has not been established. For this reason less emphasis was placed on the results of th ese outcomes than on the clinical outcomes. In order for a study to be classified as having an overall beneficial effect it had to report a significant improvement in two or more clinical outcome measures compared to the control group, or if only one cli nical outcome was reported then they had to show a significant benefit for this outcome. 47 A few studies measured employment status at baseline, but this was often not reported at the end of the intervention. It could be argued that such an outcome is more relevant to those suffering from CFS/ME than outcomes such as CD4 cell counts, and should be reported more frequently. Outcomes such as 'improvement' where participants were asked to rate themselves as better or worse than they were before the interventi on began were frequently reported. However, the person may feel better able to cope with daily activities because they have reduced their expectations of what they should achieve, rather than because they have made any recovery as a result of the interve ntion. A more objective measure of the effect of any intervention would be whether participants have increased their working hours, returned to work or increased their physical activities. Across the studies different outcomes have been favoured, possibl y as a result of views about the aetiology of the syndrome. Those holding the view that CFS is a different syndrome to ME might prefer outcomes that measure muscle fatigue, time to recovery and pain. Whereas those who hold the view that the term CFS cove rs all similar syndromes - including ME - might argue that measurements of fatigue or functioning are the most important outcomes. Use of adult oriented scales, such as the Karnofsky Performance Scale, to measure activity in children may not be appropria te. There is a need for standard outcome measures to be used in trials evaluating interventions for CFS/ME so that results can be meaningfully compared across studies. A mix of validated tools for different dimensions or domains is needed to take into co nsideration the wide and pervasive impact of this illness on many domains. A comprehensive review of outcome measures currently used would be the first step in this process. The outcomes measures identified via the intervention studies included in this re view could form the basis of such a review. 5.3 Interventions The number of different interventions assessed is almost as large as the number of studies included in this review, possibly reflecting the uncertainty in the field over the aetiology of CF S/ME. This is also reflected in the rationale given by the studies for their selection of a specific intervention. Immunological and antiviral, and pharmacological and behavioural interventions were the most frequently investigated. Detailed information on interventions was not provided in the majority of studies. Studies of pharmacological, immunologic, and antiviral interventions gave the most detailed information. For studies of behavioural therapies information was rarely given about the level of tra ining of those administering the intervention, something which may have more effect on the outcome of these interventions than on the outcomes of pharmacological interventions. 5.4 Nature of participants in included studies and diagnostic criteria The Am erican CDC criteria (1988) were most frequently used to diagnose people with CFS, followed by the Oxford criteria. Most of the studies included people diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome. One study20 included only participants diagno sed with ME according to the London criteria, and one21 included only participants diagnosed with ME according to their GPs. Other diagnoses included post viral fatigue syndrome,65 chronic mononucleosis syndrome,54 chronic post -infectious fatigue63, post infectious fatigue syndrome73 and chronic fatigue immunodeficiency syndrome.69 One study used a subset of participants diagnosed with CFS who had previ ously had Epstein Barr virus infection.56 Another study stated that participants had ME but used the Oxford criteria for diagnosis, which ME support groups claim are the least likely set of diagnostic criteria with which to identify those with ME.8 It has been suggested that CFS and ME are two separate conditions. If this is the case then the results of the studies presented in this review may be mostly applicable to patients diagnosed using CFS criteria, as CFS was the most common diagnosis. Although the different sets of criteria for diagnosing CFS vary in stringency, they all include debilitating fatigue as the major symptom, and it is likely that the findings from studies which have used one set of criteria to diagnos e CFS can be applied to people diagnosed using other criteria. 5.5 Baseline functioning Details of baseline functioning were reported by the majority of trials but the information provided varied widely between studies. Nine studies excluded people who were unable to get to the trial centre20,24,26,28,45,59,60,79 and the results of these studies may not be applicable to people with severe CFS/ME who cannot walk unaided . In those trials which did report baseline functioning, the majority of participants were unable to take part in full time employment. Trials that examined immunological function found reduced function at baseline. It would have been very helpful as regards the generalisability of the trial results if more details had be en given of participants' baseline functioning in a standardised way. Some form of classification system which assesses the severity of the illness would be helpful for future trials. 48 5.6 Drop -outs Drop -out rates may be important indicators of the accep tability of an intervention. Alternatively, high drop -out rates may indicate that the trial protocol is too rigid to accommodate any but a very specific group of participants, which will again limit the generalisability of the findings. As a way of deali ng with drop -outs an intention -to-treat analysis should be conducted. It cannot be assumed that the participants who remain in the trial are representative of participants who have dropped out, for example participants with more severe symptoms may be more likely to leave the trial than those with milder symptoms. An intention -to-treat analysis takes into account participants that have dropped out of the trial, so that the overall effect of the intervention can be evaluated. An intervention may be effect ive in treating a disease or condition but may not be acceptable, for example the side effects may be severe or the intervention itself may not be acceptable. Findings based on an analysis which only includes participants that completed the trial may conc lude a beneficial effect when in reality very few people would be happy receiving the intervention. This would be better reflected in the results of an intention -to-treat analysis. Intention -to-treat analyses were conducted in 12 of the studies and so the results of these trials are more likely to be valid.22,24,25,30,40,44 -46,51,52,61,65 The studies of CBT40 and GET45,46 with the highest drop-out rates all used an intention -to-treat analysis. Howe ver, all the included studies in this review used the 'last observation carried forward' method of intention -to-treat analysis which may give an over -optimistic picture of the effects of the intervention. It is probable that those who drop-out of a trial - rather than remaining the same as when they were last observed in the trial - will either deteriorate or improve. A more robust approach would incorporate a sensitivity analysis which could make two assumptions about drop -outs: the worst case scenario, a nd the best case scenario. Two separate analyses could be carried out using these substitute values for drop -outs (worst and best) and the true values for the intervention effect are then likely to lie between the results of the two analyses. Such an appro ach was not used in any of the trials included in this review. Where drop -out rates are higher in the intervention group than in the control group it may be the case that there is something about the intervention which trial participants find unacceptable . It may be the method or frequency of administration, or adverse effects arising from the intervention may be sufficiently great for participants to discontinue with the intervention. In this review more participants from the intervention than control gro ups dropped out in studies of the following interventions: CBT, aciclovir, immunoglobulin G, alpha interferon, phenelzine and antidepressants), GET plus fluoxetine. For GET and CBT the difference was only seen in one trial and not the othe rs so it is not clear whether it was the GET or the antidepressant fluoxetine which was unacceptable to participants. Fluoxetine was unacceptable to participants in the only other trial in which it was used, as was phenelzine. Some of the immunologic treatments also seem to have been unacceptable to trial participants. 5.7 Duration of follow -up There is little evidence from the literature as to the appropriate duration and follow -up of interventions used in the management of CFS/ME. However, as chronic fatigue syndrome is, by definition, long term it would seem sensible for trials of interventions for CFS/ME to follow up participants for at least 6 -12 months, if not longer. The relapsing nature of the illness suggests that follow -up should continue for an additional 6 -12 months (at least) after the intervention period has ended, to confirm whether any improvement persisits for a relevant period of time. Ten trials treated participants for more than six months20,24,25,33,40,45,46,53,68,71 and four trials followed up participants for six months or more after the intervention had ended.24,40,45,49 Three trials40,45,80 fulfilled both criteria. One trial of CBT followed up participants five years later.24,41 All the other trials are limited in terms of generalisability about the long term outcome in people with chronic relapsing illness. 5.8 Subgroups The most commonly investigated subgroup was depressed versus non -depressed participant s (3 trials). Other subgroups investigated were HHV -6 infected participants, participants with reduced immune response and participants who had been ill for three years or more. Other important potential subgroups, such as those who are bed or wheelch air bound, have not been studied. Future studies should consider these and other possible subgroups. In one controlled trial of CBT those who scored higher on the CES -D scale for depression were more likely to respond to the intervention than those with low scores.29 It is worth noting that this trial was not randomised and that the two other RCTs of this intervention showed no differential response of depressed versus non - 49 depressed participants.24,25 In an RCT, of moclo bemide, those in the intervention group with reduced immune responses scored the most impressive improvement on the Karnofsky Performance Index.61 5.9 Combination therapy As CFS/ME affects so many different aspects of functioning and s ymptoms, combined therapies will necessarily be part of clinical interventions, even though they may initially have to be studied individually. Only three trials investigated the combined effects of more than one intervention. One RCT evaluated fluoxeti ne and graded exercise and found no significant effect of fluoxetine either as the sole treatment or in combination with GET, although a beneficial effect of GET was reported.46 Fluoxetine showed no beneficial effect in the only other tr ial in which it was investigated.58 The other RCT evaluated the combined effects of leukocyte extract and CBT26 and found the group receiving both CBT and leukocyte extract showed a significantly greater improvement in general health than the other intervention groups. No significant differences were found for any of the other outcomes investigated. Given that most people with CFS/ME have tried a variety of interventions, more RCTs of combined therapy would be helpful. The third RCT investigated the effects of treating specific symptoms of CFS. This study found a beneficial effect of treatment in those in the intervention group compared to the control group.22 5.10 Children One RCT of immunoglobulin G including only young people aged less than 1855 reported an overall beneficial effect on two measures of function. A second RCT of immunoglobulin G including both adults and children (although no -one under the age of 16 was included51) reported an overall beneficial effect on measures of symptoms and function. When considering immunoglobulin G as a possible treatment for CFS/ME the fact that it is a blood product with the known risks attached to this should be taken into consideration. No other evaluations of interventions conducted in children were identified. Other interventions in children with CFS/ME need to be evaluated and should be a priority for future research. 50 6. CONCLUSIONS A total of 46 trials inves tigated the effectiveness of seven different categories of intervention: behavioural, immunological, antiviral, pharmacological, supplements, complementary/ alternative and other. Overall the interventions demonstrated mixed results in terms of effectivene ss. All conclusions about effectiveness should be considered together with the methodological inadequacies in some of the studies. Interventions which have shown evidence of effectiveness include cognitive behavioural therapy and GET. There is insuffi cient evidence about how sub -groups of patients may respond differently to treatments and further studies investigating additional subgroups are needed. In some of the included studies bed or wheelchair restricted patients and children have been excluded, which raises questions about the applicability of findings to all people with CFS/ME. Immunoglobulin G is the only intervention which has been investigated in young people. There is insufficient evidence for additive or combined effects of interventions where more than one therapy is used. Future research could usefully compare CBT and GET. Future research needs to combine scientific rigour with patient acceptability and good quality research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of pacing, ideally i n comparison to CBT and GET. The large number of outcome measures used makes standardisation of outcomes a priority for future research. . 51 7. Bibliography 1. Whiting P, Bagnall AM, Sowden AJ, et al.

Purpose of intervention: To test the efficacy of graded aerobic exercise programme in chronic fatigue syndrome and to assess physiologi cal, functional and symptomatic changes. Intervention details: Intervention: Graded aerobic exercise. Participants attended for supervised treatment and given next week's exercise prescription, home exercise was prescribed for at least 5 days a week with initial sessions lasting between 5 & 15 mins with intensity of 40% of peak oxygen consumption (roughly 50% max heart rate), daily exercise prescription increased by 1 or 2 minutes up to a maximum of 30 minutes, intensity increased to 60% peak oxygen consump tion, participants given heart rate monitors to ensure did not exceed level prescribed. Main exercise was walking but also encouraged to take other forms of exercise, advised not exceed prescribed exercise during a good phase, if participants complained o f increased fatigue were advised to continue with same level of exercise for extra week and increase when fatigue had lessened.

Intervention details: Interventions : 1. Fixed daily dose 20mg fluoxetine plus graded exercise (n=33). 2. Graded exercise and placebo drug (n=34). 3. Exercise control (activity diaries) and fluoxetine (n=35). Control: Exercise control and placebo drug (n=34). Placebo controlled and controlled for the amount of therapist contact. Treatment by physiotherapist on 8 occasions over 6 months. Graded exercise: participants instructed to carry out preferred aerobic activity (walking/ jogging, swimming or cycling) for 20mins at least 3x per week. Activity intensity initially set at a level which utilised oxygen at 75% of participant's tested functional maximum. Exercise intensity was increased when there was a consistent recorded reduction of 10 beats per minute in post -exercise heart r ate for one week and two points on the perceived exertion scale. Exercise control groups: participants not offered specific advice on how much exercise to take but told to do what they could when they felt capable and rest when they felt they needed to. All trial participants kept activity diaries which were reviewed every 4 weeks.

No sig difference in drop - out rates fluoxetine vs placebo (24/68 vs 16/69). 11 dropped out due to side effects (9 Fluoxetine, 2 Placebo), 16 due to lack of efficacy (which groups not stated) and 13 for other reaso ns or no reason. Drop -outs significantly more likely to be members of self help orgs (15/39 vs 20/95, p=0.04), have changed/ given up job (38/40 vs 76/96, p=0.02) and have worse baseline scores on MOS health perception scale. Adverse effects: not stated: 11 dropped out due to adverse effects Results Outcome 1 Outcome 2: Outcome 3: Outcome 4: General comments: 21 drop-outs were reassessed at the end of the trial. There was no worsening of scores on the fatigue scale, functional work capacity, HAD depression scale and MOS health perception scale. Outcome: Fatigue Chalder's 14 item fatigue scale, self -rated questionnaire. Primary outcome = change in score and % of participants scoring below case level on the fatigue scale. Baseline treatment group: Ex+P to 0.01) Comments: there were trends for exercise to improve fatigue scale scores at week 12 (mean change 2.1( -0.6 to 4.8, p=0.13) and at week 26 (mean change 2.9( -0.2 to 6.1, p=0.07). Fluoxetine had no effect on fatigue scale at week 12 or wk 26. At the beginning of the study no participants in any group were in the non -case range for fatigue. At 26 weeks results were as follows: Ex+F 6, Ex+P 6, ExP+F 2, ExP+P 2. Outcome General health MOS short form scales: physical function, role or occupation functi on, social function, social function, pain, health perceptions, mental health. Secondary outcome measure = change in score. Comments: No significant changes on any MOS scale. Values not reported. Outcome Depression: Hospital anxiety and depression scales ( HAD). Secondary outcome = change in score. Baseline treatment -1.3(-2.3 to -0.3) Comments: No significant effects of exercise or fluoxetine on HAD scores at 26 weeks. In complete analysis F reduced score at 12 weeks but in ITT analysis there were no differences. No effec ts of exercise on HAD case level of depression but fluoxetine treated group reduced from 13 to 5 with one new case arising. Placebo group cases reduced from 5 to 0 but 5 new cases arose.

Reduction in absolute count of T -cell subsets at the lower limit of normal ranges for testing laboratory found in 43% of participants, in CD4 subset in 9 participants, and in CD8 subset in 18 participants. Reduced DTH responses demonstrated in 33 participants, 40/49 participants had abnormal cell -mediated immunity evidenced by reduced DTH response and/or T -cell lymph openia. 7/33 participants met criteria for current major depressive episode, 19 had mild depression Diagnostic criteria: Similar to CDC (1988) Details: History of at least 6 months duration of marked exercise aggravated muscle fatigue, with abnormally pro longed recovery time, associated with typical constitutional and neuropsychiatric symptoms. CFS was producing frequent medical consultation and a substantial reduction in the ability to participate in usual daily activities when compared with participant' s premorbid status. Other chronic infectious or immunodeficiency related disorders excluded Inclusion criteria No previous immunologic therapy Drop -outs 2 immunoglobulin recipients with drew from study: one because of mild, but transient, abnormal liver f unction tests, other withdrew voluntarily after phlebitis had occurred with the first infusion Adverse effects Phlebitis and constitutional symptoms including headaches, worsened fatigue and concentration impairment occurred more commonly in the immunoglob ulin recipients than in the participants who received placebo. Phlebitis occurred in 35/65 immunoglobulin infusions & with 1 placebo infusion, constitutional symptoms occurred in 53/65 immunoglobulin infusions and 19/78 placebo infusions. Results Outcome 1 Outcome 2: Outcome 3: Outcome: Symptom measure: Symptoms and disability as assessed by the physician Comments: 10/23 of immunoglobulin and 3/26 of the placebo recipients had marked reduction in symptoms and improvement in function al capacity (chi2=4.85, p=0.03) Outcome Employment status: Measure of functional capacity Comments : 6/13 who responded (all immunoglobulin recipients) resumed pre -morbid employment status in full -time occupation or housework, 5 participants (3 immunoglobul in and 2 placebo) recommenced employment or other activities in a part -time capacity. 11/13 responders (9 immunoglobulin, 2 placebo) resumed involvement in leisure or sporting activities, all responders increased level of participation in social activitie s, in 8 participants (7 immunoglobulin) this increase allowed regular social events, in 8/10 immunoglobulin responders improvement in symptoms and function was noted within 3 weeks of first infusion and tended to increase incrementally after subsequent inf usions. Remaining participants had little to no change in ability to participate in work, leisure and social activities.

To test the hypothesis that CBT is more effective than orthodox medical management or other interventions in adults with CFS. Type of in tervention Treatment Specific interventions included in the review Cognitive Behavioural therapy, interventions which met the following criteria:: 1. A psychological therapy which incorporated both attempted modification of though and beliefs about sympto ms and illness and attempted modification of behavioural responses to symptoms and illness, such as rest, sleep and activity. Two types of CBT: Type A: attempted to increase activity and reduce rest time in a systematic manner, independent of symptoms, t owards normal level Type B: Attempted to tailor the participant's rest and activity towards levels which were compatible with the limitations imposed by the disorder. 2. Individual or group treatment Controls: trials which included orthodox medical managem ent (elements of clinic attendance, investigation, reassurance and simple advise) or other intervention which did not meet the criteria for CBT as control treatment were included in the review. Trials of experimental intervention which included drug trea tment, or self -help treatments as part of the intervention were excluded. Participants included in the review Participants over the age of 16 who fulfilled the following criteria for CFS were included, irrespective of gender, culture, or setting: 1. Fatig ue is the principal symptom 2. Fatigue is medically unexplained 3. Fatigue is of sufficient severity to significantly disable or distress the participant 4. Fatigue is of duration of over 6 months Trials which included several disorders were included if ov er 90% of participants had CFS according to the above criteria. Outcomes assessed in the review Physical functioning, usually measured by rating scales. Trials had to measure one or more aspects of physical functioning or of symptoms, quality of life, he alth service resource use, compliance with and acceptability of intervention. Study designs of evaluations included in the review Randomised controlled trials in which participants with CFS receiving CBT were compared with a control group receiving orthod ox medical management or another intervention. Trials which randomised therapists rather than participants to intervention or control group were included, provided that the specific aim of the study was to examine the effect of the intervention. Trials h ad to measure outcomes at least one month after the cessation of treatment. What sources were searched to identify primary studies? The following electronic database were searched: MEDLINE (1966 to June 1988), EMBASE (1980 to May 1998), PsychLIT (1974 to September 1997), Biological Abstracts (January 1985 to March 1998), SIGLE (1970 to 1995), Index to Scientific and Technical Proceedings (1982 to 1998) and Science Citation Index. A comprehensive search strategy was developed to search these databases (fur ther details in paper). Known specialists in the field and principal authors of studies identified in the 109 literature searches were contacted to help identify further studies. Both published and unpublished studies were included. Studies published in an y language were considered. On what criteria was the validity of primary studies assessed? Trials were allocated to 3 quality categories: A (high quality; all of criteria met), B (moderate quality; one or more criteria only partially met), and C (low qual ity; one ore more criteria not met). The following quality criteria were assessed: 1. Concealment of treatment allocation 2. Presentation of outcomes of participants who withdrew from the study 3. Clear definition of outcome measures, blinding of assessors and app ropriateness of duration of follow -up 4. Reporting and comparability of baseline characteristics 5. Comparability of care programmes, other than interventions 6. Definition of inclusion criteria Trials of category C were excluded from the review. How were decision s on the relevance of primary studies made? Each reviewer (2) independently decided whether each potential trial fulfilled inclusion criteria. How were judgements of validity made? Each reviewer independently assessed the quality of included studies. How was the data extracted from primary studies? Data was extracted independently by the reviewers. When there was disagreement, this was discussed and a consensus decision was reached. Information was collected on: characteristics of participants, characte ristics of interventions, characteristics of outcome measures and results. If any information was not available in the published trial, it was sought by correspondence with the trial authors. Number of studies included 3 RCTs (n=164; 60 in 2 trials, in t hird trial 44 randomised to 2 arms of relevance to the review out of total sample size of 90). How were the studies combined? Two comparisons were made: Type A CBT versus other intervention and Type B CBT versus alternate intervention. The initial analys is of dichotomous outcomes used the odds ratio (OR). When appropriate, ORs were combined across studies using Peto's fixed effect method to give the pooled OR with 95% confidence intervals. The number needed to treat, with 95% confidence intervals, was also calculated. Continuous outcome measures were transformed, where possible, to dichotomous outcome measures. Where this was not possible, the effect size, with confidence intervals, was calculated for each study. How were differences between studies investigated? Not stated Results of the review Treatment duration varied between 4 -6 months. Length of follow -up post -treatment varied from 3 -7 months. Two trials were conducted in the UK and 1 in Australia. All three trials included adult outpatients with CFS. 2 trials used the Oxford criteria for diagnosis of CFS, the other trial used the Australian criteria. All 3 trials used CBT type A on an individual basis with weekly/bi -weekly sessions. One study compared CBT with relaxation, one with routing medical care, and one compared CBT with placebo injections to routine medical care and placebo injections. Two of the studies were rated as 'high' and one of 'moderate' methodological quality. Physical function: 2 trials found a beneficial treatment wi th CBT at final follow -up compared to relaxation (OR: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.41) or routine medical care (OR: 0.16, 0.06 to 0.44). The beneficial effect of one of these trials appeared mainly at the end of the formal treatment programme. Other measures o f physical function including SF -36 score, Work and Social Adjustment Scale score, and the long -term goals rating also demonstrated a beneficial effect of CBT compared to relaxation. 110 The second study found a significant benefit of CBT compared with routin e medical care on interference with activities, weekly days in bed, and distance walked in 6 minutes. The third trial did not report functional results in such a way as to allow reliable interpretation, however it does appear that the groups do not have s ignificantly different outcomes. Fatigue: This was addressed by all three trials but different measures were used in each trial. CBT was found to reduce fatigue compared to relaxation and routine medical care, again the third study did not present resu lts in a manner which permitted interpretation. Quality of life : CBT appears to benefit quality of life as assessed by 2 studies Health service resource use : other treatments commenced during the trial was measured in 2 trials and did not show significan t differences between treatment and control groups. Compliance and acceptability of intervention : the number of treatment completers was available for 2 of the trials, there was no significant difference in treatment completion between CBT and either relaxation or routine medical care. The perceived usefulness of treatment was greater with CBT than with relaxation but this difference was not significant. Other outcomes: Participants receiving relaxation were significantly more likely to continue to satis fy diagnostic criteria for CFS than those receiving CBT (OR 0.12, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.37), and were more likely to be dissatisfied with their treatment (OR: 0.34, 95% CI:0.12, 0.95). Participants receiving CBT were more likely to rate themselves as globally improved than those receiving either relaxation (OR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.08, CI: 0.08, 0.63). Was any cost information reported?
