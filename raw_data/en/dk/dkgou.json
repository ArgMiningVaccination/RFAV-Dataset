It is caused by the deposition of cholesterol, fats, and other substances in the tunica intima which leads to narrowing of the blood vessels, loss of elasticity, and arterial wall thickening, thus causing difficulty in blood flow. Natural products have been used as one of the most important strategies for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases for a long time. In recent decades, as interests in natural products including medicinal herbs have increased, many studies regarding natural compounds that are effective against atherosclerosis have been conducted. The purpose of this review is to provide a brief over-view of the natural compounds that have been used for the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis, and their mechanisms of action based on recent research. INTRODUCTION Atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiac ischemia, heart failure, heart attack, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, is known to be one of the major causes of death and morbidity worldwide. Endothelial cell injury, damage, and dysfunction in the heart are characteristic properties of atherosclerosis. Endothelial damage leads the build-up of plaque in the damaged area and narrowing of the arteries, as well as cholesterol accumulation on the artery wall and monocytes adhesion to the endothelium. This process leads to chronic inflammation and eventually causes stenosis or thrombosis ( [Insull, 2009](#b18-bt-27-254)). Natural products have been regarded as important all over the world since the beginning of human civilization for many purposes including medicinal use. Like in many other diseases, medicinal herbs have been used to treat patients with atherosclerosis. However, elucidation of the mechanisms of action (MOAs) of these herbs has just started, via the use of cellular models for anti-atherogenic natural product screening ( [Orekhov and Ivanova, 2016](#b38-bt-27-254)) or extensive reviews on specific plants that have been used for the prevention of atherosclerosis ( [Prasad, 2010](#b46-bt-27-254); [Varshney and Budoff, 2016](#b55-bt-27-254)) However, in this review, recent studies regarding natural products, and more specifically medicinal herbs, were sorted and described according to their MOAs against atherosclerosis to increasing our understanding of these plants. BLOOD LIPID-LOWERING EFFECTS OF MEDICINAL HERBS Dyslipidemia is known as one of the main risk factors of atherosclerosis. Numerous studies have demonstrated that hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia lead to the increased risk of development and progression of atherosclerosis ( [Liu et al., 2013](#b26-bt-27-254); [Peng et al., 2017](#b45-bt-27-254); [Roubille et al., 2018](#b49-bt-27-254)). Previous studies have indicated that increased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and its major protein, apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100), are critical causes of atherosclerosis. Infiltration and retention of apoB-containing lipoproteins in the artery wall can initiate inflammatory responses and promote the development of atherosclerosis ( [Liu et al., 2013](#b26-bt-27-254)). Many studies have therefore focused on the lipid-lowering effect of natural products ( Tribulus terrestris decreased serum lipids in New Zealand rabbits fed a high-cholesterol diet. The experimental group treated with extract of T. terrestris showed decreased levels of total cholesterol LDL-C, and triglyceride (TG) in those in the negative control group ( [Tuncer et al., 2009](#b53-bt-27-254)). Extract of Ocimum basilicum reduced lipid profiles in Triton WR-1339-induced hyperlipidemic rats. In rats treated with O. basilicum extract, TC, TG, and LDL-C levels decreased, while HDL-C levels were higher than those in rats treated with Triton alone ( [Amrani et al., 2006](#b1-bt-27-254)). The dried roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza, commonly called Danshen, have long been used in traditional oriental medicine for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. Cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), a class B scavenger receptor, is known to be important in the pathogenesis of vascular inflammatory diseases. Salvianolic acid B, the most abundant bioactive compound from S. miltiorrhiza, showed inhibition of CD36-mediated lipid uptake. Using surface plasmon resonance analysis, salvianolic acid B was found to bind directly to CD36 with high affinity, thus confirming its physical interaction with this receptor ( [Bao et al., 2012](#b3-bt-27-254)). Treatment of rats fed with high-fat/-cholesterol diets with Cynanchum wilfordii ethanol extract reduced while HDL-C levels ( al., Terminalia arjuna markedly decreased TC, TG, and LDL levels, increased HDL levels, and furthermore lessened atherosclerotic lesions in the aortas of rabbits fed a high-fat ( al., 2015](#b62-bt-27-254)). Marrubium vulgare extract containing polar products decreased plasma lipid levels. The lipid-lowering effects of petroleum ether-, chloroform-, ethyl acetate-, and methanol-soluble fractions of M. vulgare extract were investigated. The solvent-soluble fractions showed lipid-lowering effects in plasma TC, and petroleum ether fractions significantly lowered not only LDL-C levels but also TG levels. Elevated atherogenic indexes (AIs) and LDL-/HDL-C ratios were more influenced by polar fractions (methanol and ethyl acetate), while these atherogenic markers were not significantly inhibited by the chloroform- and petroleum ether-soluble fractions ( [Ibrahim thymoquinone, the active constituents of Nigella sativa seed oil, inhibited the formation of early atherosclerotic lesions in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. Administration of propolis or thymoquinone together with a cholesterol-rich diet remarkably decreased LDL-C, and TG HDL-C levels. Furthermore, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of the LDL receptor (LDL-R), scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1), cholesterol 7-hydroxylase A1 (CYP7A1), and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A up-regulated by C. orbiculatus. Conversely, C. orbiculatus significantly decreased lipid deposition in the arterial wall ( [Zhang et al., 2013](#b67-bt-27-254)). ( [Vaidya et al., 2009](#b54-bt-27-254)). Lipid metabolism dysfunction leads to consequential health problems in postmenopausal women and can be a risk factor for the progression of atherosclerosis. Pueraria mirifica remarkably lowered serum apo-B apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) and levels. Moreover, LDL-C to HDL-C and apo-B to apo A-I were significantly reduced in the P. mirifica-treated group ( [Okamura et al., 2008](#b40-bt-27-254)). Administration of of including those of TC, LDL-C, and TG, while it increased HDL-C levels in rats fed a cholesterol-rich diet ( [Zou et al., 2005](#b72-bt-27-254)). Astragaloside TG, and LDL-C in the blood of apo-E-knockout mice fed a high-fat diet ( [Qin et al., 2015](#b47-bt-27-254)). INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF MEDICINAL HERBS AGAINST MONOCYTE RECRUITMENT AND ACTIVATION Monocyte-endothelial cell interactions are reported to induce the expression of adhesion molecules such may cause the accumulation and migration of monocytes into the subendothelial space. Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), modified LDL, and APs act on monocyte-derived macrophages, which accelerates the transition of monocytes into foam cells. Foam cells are fat-laden macrophages that serve as the hallmark of early stage atherosclerotic lesion formation. Corilagin from Phyllanthus emblica and its analogue Dgg16 are reported to have anti-atherogenic effects. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) incubated with oxidized LDL (oxLDL) were treated with corilagin or Dgg16 quickly decreased adhesion a dose of mmol/L or higher from Salvia ICAM-1 expression necrosis factor- (TNF-) and relevant adhesion anti-atherogenic activity of cryptotanshinone, a constituent of S. miltiorrhiza, was evaluated using apo-E-deficient mice fed an atherogenic diet as well suppressed subsequent LOX-1-induced adhesion of monocytes to HUVECs lowering the ICAM-1 and adhesion molecules ( [Ang et al., 2011](#b2-bt-27-254)). The ethanol suppressed adhesion of monocyte-/macrophage-like human macrophage cells vulgaris also decreased expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, reactive oxygen species (ROS), E-selectin, and NO production in TNF--induced human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) and decreased NF-B activation ( [Park et through the and the phosphorylation extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) induced by which is involved in regulating ICAM-1 production ( al., to the endothelium in a manner and suppressed the expression of TNF--induced endothelial adhesion molecules such a sonodynamic effect on THP-1-derived macrophages. Commercial drugs that have sonodynamic effects become cytotoxic upon exposure to ultrasound, which can be useful when treating a localized part of the body, thus reducing the risk of systemic side effects ( [Wang et al., 2013](#b58-bt-27-254)). Fibronectin is one of the most important extracellular matrix proteins as it plays a critical role in leukocyte recruitment to the endothelium and initiates the process of atherosclerosis. The effects of protocatechualdehyde, an aqueous ingredient of S. miltiorrhiza, were evaluated on the expression of fibronectin in HUVECs stimulated with TNF- via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay blot analysis. treatment remarkably attenuated TNF--stimulated fibronectin surface expression and secretion ROS generation and c-Jun 2015](#b52-bt-27-254)). Aqueous up-regulation and protein expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 were suppressed by this extract via inhibition of NF-B and ROS. In addition, TNF--induced degradation of IB was inhibited by blocking phosphorylation of in HUVEC ( [Fardoun et al., 2017](#b13-bt-27-254)). Purple perilla extract and its major compound -asarone inhibited oxLDL-induced foam cell formation by inhibiting SR-B1 expression. However, purple perilla extract promoted the up-regulation of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1, and subsequently promoted cholesterol efflux from macrophages by activating interactions between peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), liver X receptor (LXR), and ABC transporters ( [Park et al., 2015](#b43-bt-27-254)). These results are summarized (2010)](#b25-bt-27-254) [Park et al. (2015)](#b43-bt-27-254) ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS OF MEDICINAL HERBS Many studies have revealed the association between the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis with the vascular inflammation mechanisms. Inflammation participates in all stages of atherogenesis, from lesion initiation to thrombotic complications of the disease. Arterial endothelial cells begin to express adhesion molecules that bind leukocytes. Leukocytes adhere to the endothelium to penetrate into the intima at the lesion formation site in response to chemoattractants. Next, blood-derived inflammatory cells participate in and trigger inflammatory responses. Signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 (STAT3), a transcription factor involved in inflammatory responses and the cell cycle, is activated by chemokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. Pretreatment of endothelial with IL-6-induced of Tyr705 and Ser727 on STAT3 in a concentration-dependent manner. However, it did not affect the phosphorylation of Janus kinase 1 (EMSA) revealed that magnolol treatment significantly decreased STAT3 binding to the IL-6 response elements region, and ICAM-1 expression was significantly reduced on the endothelial surface ( [Chen et al., 2006](#b8-bt-27-254)). Emodin from atherosclerotic plaque in the aortic root of apo-E-knockout mice by exerting anti-inflammatory effects. It also significantly inhibited the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), while type 4 (CXCR4) platelet and also reduced stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and CXCR4 expression in the aorta. Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) demonstrated that astragaloside IV significantly down-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of SDF-1 and CXCR4 in apo-E-knockout mice fed a high-fat ( et al., 2011](#b2-bt-27-254)). Cryptotanshinone significantly suppressed formation of atherosclerotic plaque and increased plaque stability in apo-E-knockout mice by reducing the expression of LOX-1 and MMP-9, and NF-B activation. In addition, it reduced the expression of serum pro-inflammatory mediators without altering the serum lipid profile ( et al., 2015](#b31-bt-27-254)). The ethanolic extract of P. vulgaris suppressed adhesion of HAMCs, JAK2 was decreased by pretreatment with salvianolic acid B. This compound also increased the expression of protein inhibitor of activated STAT 1 (PIAS1) and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) in endothelial ( [Chen of (ADP)-activated platelets to EA.hy926 cells (a human endothelial cell line) and inhibited activation of NF-B. In addition, salvianolic acid B significantly inhibited mRNA and the release of their corresponding proteins in EA.hy926 cells ( [Xu et al., 2014](#b61-bt-27-254)). Honokiol, an active component isolated from M. officinalis, markedly suppressed the overexpression of pentraxin 3 in palmitic acid (PA)-induced p50 and p65 in the IKK/IB/NF-B signaling pathway. In addition, honokiol markedly inhibited the production IL-6, IL-8, PA-induced HUVECs ( Eleven ingredients of the herb Folium Eriobotryae were shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties. Using systematic network analyses, their targets were determined to be 43 inflammation-associated proteins including cyclooxygenase 1 transcription in the MAPK signaling pathways ( [Zhang et al., of from sweet wormwood, attenuated the progression of atherosclerotic lesion formation alone or in combination with rosuvastatin in western-type diet-fed apo-E-knockout mice. No differences in food uptake, BW, and plasma lipid levels were observed in any of the groups, but a significant reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF- and IL-6 was noted in the treated groups. Furthermore, artesunate suppressed expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines such as IL-8 and MCP-1 in the aortas of mice. Rosuvastatin combined with artesunate delayed the progression of atherosclerotic lesions more effectively than artesunate alone ( [Jiang et al., 2016](#b20-bt-27-254)). -Elemene isolated from Curcuma wenyujin reduced the size of atherosclerotic lesions and increased plaque stability in apo-E-knockout mice by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cell adhesion 5-LO is a enzyme in inflammatory disorders such as atherosclerosis, 5-LO inhibition by Plectranthus zeylanicus extract, a medicinal plant extensively used in Sri Lanka and South India to treat inflammatory disorders, was evaluated ( [Napagoda et al., 2014](#b35-bt-27-254)). P. zeylanicus extracted with the non-polar solvents n-hexane and dichloromethane significantly inhibited 5-LO activity in stimulated human neutrophils with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 6.6 and 12 g/mL, respectively, and suppressed human recombinant 5-LO with IC50 of 0.7 and 1.2 g/mL, respectively ( [Napagoda et al., 2014](#b35-bt-27-254)). A cell-free assay using isolated human recombinant 5-LO was employed in this study in order to investigate whether the extract directly inhibited 5-LO activity. Z. nummularia extract decreased expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, ICAM-1, induced by TNF- in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, as revealed via reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and western blot analysis. C. orbiculatus reduced C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, and TNF- levels in plasma. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis showed that CD68 up-regulation and NF-B p65 protein activation in the arterial wall were reduced by C. orbiculatus treatment as well ( [Zhang et al., 2013](#b67-bt-27-254)). triterpenoid isolated wilfordii, inhibited the phosphorylation and degradation of IB and decreased the production of inducible nitric oxide VCAM-1 expression inhibited NF-B p65 the nucleus and phosphorylation of IB, kinase B (Akt), and protein kinase et of the relationship between atherosclerosis and 2,3,5,4-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O--D-glucoside revealed that five proteins were mainly involved in cholesterol transport, inflammation, cell apoptosis, and cell adhesion. 2,3,5,4-Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O--D-glucoside elevated the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), lipocortin 1, and apo A-1 but reduced the expression of calreticulin and vimentin ( [Yao et al., 2013](#b64-bt-27-254)). Do In regulating the 5 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. Treatment with this herbal preparation reduced the size of atherosclerotic lesions, suppressed ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin expression, and reduced lipid accumulation, progression of inflammation, and fatty acid synthase (FAS) levels. Furthermore, Do In Seung Gi-Tang promoted AMPK and inhibited acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) expression in liver tissues ( [Park et al., 2016](#b44-bt-27-254)). These results are summarized (2013)](#b64-bt-27-254) al. (2016)](#b44-bt-27-254) ANTI-OXIDATIVE EFFECTS OF MEDICINAL HERBS Oxidative stress induced by the excessive generation of ROS and macrophage inflammation has emerged as a crucial mechanism for the initiation and progression of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis ( [Kattoor et al., 2017](#b21-bt-27-254)). OxLDL is a harmful type of cholesterol that is formed when LDL-C is damaged by free radicals. Malondialdehyde (MDA), which is formed during oxidation of LDL, is used as an oxidative stress marker. Corilagin and its analogue Dgg16 decreased the formation of MDA and inhibited the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) activated by oxLDL ( [Duan et al., 2005](#b12-bt-27-254)). inhibited NOX4 expression ( [Zhao et al., 2017](#b68-bt-27-254)). The aqueous extract of O. basilicum displayed very high antioxidant power, indicating that 1 L of the extract possessed antioxidant capacity equal to that of 32.8 g ascorbic acid ( [Amrani et al., 2006](#b1-bt-27-254)). Cryptotanshinone reduced LOX-1 mRNA and protein expression, and suppressed NOX4-induced ROS production and comparative activation of NF-B in HUVECs ( [Liu et al., 2015](#b31-bt-27-254)). Tanshinone IIA, which was also isolated from S. miltiorrhiza, showed protective effects against H2O2-induced apoptosis and protected HUVECs from inflammatory mediators induced via pregnane cell apoptosis in EA.hy926 cells. RT-PCR and western blotting results indicated that it remarkably suppressed the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins such as B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2-associated X protein (Bax) and caspase-3, while expression of the Bcl-2 GPx activities, cultured macrophages cell death ( [Li et al., 2008](#b27-bt-27-254)). Cymbopogon citratus extract reduced the formation of ROS by D-glucose, hydrogen peroxide, and oxLDL in HUVECs ( [Campos et al., 2014](#b5-bt-27-254)). The protective effects of Danshen aqueous extract and its active compounds were studied on HUVECs using an in vitro tube formation assay. The Danshen extract and its pure compounds showed effectiveness in protecting HUVECs against homocysteine-induced injury, providing evidence of its beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease. Treatment with B. officinalis inhibited TNF--induced ROS formation in HUVECs ( [Lee et al., 2010](#b25-bt-27-254)). Farrerol, a flavonoid considered to be the major component in the dried leaves of Rhododendron dauricum, significantly increased cell viability and enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) and GPx activity in reduced elevation of intracellular MDA, ROS, and apoptosis, and significantly reduced the expression Bax mRNA and protein, cleaved caspase-3, and phospho-p38 MAPK, while expression of Bcl-2 mRNA and protein in H2O2-induced EA.hy926 cells, as determined via real-time PCR and Western blot analysis ( [Li et al., 2013](#b26-bt-27-254)). Salvianolic acid Salvianolic acid attenuated human aortic LDL oxidation as well as [Yang et al., 2011](#b63-bt-27-254)). Treatment with -elemene up-regulated the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, GPx, and glutathione in the aorta, while lowering oxidative damaging biomarker MDA. -Elemene also elevated the generation of NO and up-regulated phosphorylation of eNOS (ser1177) and Akt in vitro ( [Liu et al., 2017](#b29-bt-27-254)). Low-molecular weight compounds from white ginseng, mostly phenolic compounds, decreased the extent of atherosclerosis by attenuating oxidative stress ( [Lee et al., induced by platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) in VSMCs, and increased the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK 1/2 via PDGF stimulation. These results suggest that protocatechualdehyde inhibits PDGF signaling by acting upstream of Akt and ERK 1/2, which indicates that its antioxidant effect might be related to PDGF thymoquinone treatment could reverse the oxidative damage resulting from a high-cholesterol diet in rabbits. Ethanolic propolis extract and thymoquinone decreased thiobarbituric acid glutathione levels in high-cholesterol diet-fed rabbits (Nadar et al., 2010). C. orbiculatus decreased MDA levels and increased SOD activity in the plasma of guinea pigs fed a high-fat diet. These results indicate that C. orbiculatus inhibited oxidative stress ( [Zhang significantly inhibited oxLDL-induced THP-1-derived macrophage impairment by decreasing ROS levels, lipid accumulation, and caspase-3 activation. Isorhamnetin also [Luo et al., 2015](#b32-bt-27-254)). Celastrol significantly suppressed oxLDL-induced excessive expression of LOX-1 and production of ROS in RAW264.7 mouse macrophages. Furthermore, celastrol remarkably reduced the expression of LOX-1 and generation of superoxide in mouse aortas ( al., extract of (DPPH), and acid) (ABTS) radical-scavenging activity. this extract showed ferric ion reducing capacity, metal chelating ability, and reduced lipid peroxidation in mitochondrial fractions significantly more than ethanolic extracts. In addition, the extract remarkably inhibited LDL oxidation ( [Visavadiya et al., 2010](#b56-bt-27-254)). The ethanolic extract of Glossogyne tenuifolia and its main compound luteolin-7-glucoside were revealed to be scavengers of superoxide, DPPH, and radicals ( [Wu et al., 2005](#b60-bt-27-254)). Copper-mediated LDL oxidation was also reduced by treatment with G. tenuifolia extract and luteolin-7-glucoside, and this was evaluated by measuring the formation of conjugated dienes and MDA, as well as electrophoretic mobility. Oral administration of the flavonoid-rich extract of H. perforatum reduced MDA levels in the sera and livers of rats. It also elevated SOD activity in the serum and liver, although catalase activity was significantly increased only in the liver ( [Zou et al., 2005](#b72-bt-27-254)). These results are (2005)](#b60-bt-27-254) [Zou et al. (2005)](#b72-bt-27-254) INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF MEDICINAL HERBS AGAINST THE INFILTRATION AND PROLIFERATION OF VASCULAR SMOOTH MUSCLE CELLS VSMC proliferation and migration, which contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, are known to be associated with other cellular processes such as apoptosis, senescence, inflammation, and matrix alterations. Therefore, understanding VSMC behavior in atherosclerosis is critical in identifying therapeutic targets to both prevent and treat atherosclerosis. Pre-treatment with corynoxeine (5-50 M) significantly reduced VSMC numbers and inhibited PDGF-BB-induced DNA synthesis and ERK1/2 activation by VSMCs without inducing cytotoxicity ( [Kim 2008](#b22-bt-27-254)). isolated from Sparganium stoloniferum, suppressed endothelial cell tube formation and cell migration in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment of HUVECs with sparstolonin B caused an increase of cells in the G1 phase and decreased the number of cells in the S phase. Cyclin E2 (CCNE2) and cell division cycle 6 (CDC6), cell division regulatory proteins, were down-regulated after sparstolonin B exposure. In addition, sparstolonin B significantly reduced capillary length and branching number ( [Bateman et al., 2013](#b4-bt-27-254)). Hibiscus sabdariffa is also known to show hypolipidemic activity in cholesterol-fed rabbits. In addition, it suppressed the formation of foam cells and inhibited the migration of smooth muscle cells and calcification in blood vessels ( [Chen et al., 2003](#b7-bt-27-254)). Nelumbo nucifera leaf extract and p38 MAPK pathways in VSMCs. Non-cytotoxic doses of this extract also inhibited the secretion of MMP-2/9 and cell migration by suppressing the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/PI3K/small G protein pathway. Histopathological results revealed that 1.0% of the extract reduced formation of neointima, restrained the proliferation of smooth muscle cells, and reduced MMP-2 secretion in the blood vessels of rabbits ( [Ho 2010](#b16-bt-27-254)). The ethanolic division cycle 25c (Cdc25c), and G2/M cell cycle regulators. In addition, treatment with this extract activated ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK, and inhibited expression of MMP-9 induced by TNF- in VSMCs. This extract also reduced the expression of NF-B and activator protein 1 (AP-1), which are essential cis-elements the MMP-9 promoter ( [Lee et al., 2012](#b24-bt-27-254)). Salvianolic acid B remarkably suppressed LPS-induced cell migration via the inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 synthesis and the reduction and ( [Lin et al., 2007](#b28-bt-27-254)). Protocatechualdehyde especially PDGF-induced and proliferation of VSMCs. It also down-regulated the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways, both of which regulated major enzymes associated with proliferation and migration. In addition, it promoted S-phase arrest of the VSMC cell cycle and inhibited cyclin D2 expression ( [Moon et al., 2012](#b33-bt-27-254)). The ethanolic of Z. nummularia decreased HASMC proliferation, adhesion to migration, and invasion ( [Fardoun et al., 2017](#b13-bt-27-254)). Esculetin significantly suppressed the proliferation of VSMCs through a lipoxygenase-dependent pathway. Three predominant signaling pathways are inhibited by esculetin. The first pathway is the activation of p42/44 MAPK and the immediate early genes of the downstream effectors of c-fos and c-jun, the second is the activation of NF-B and AP-1, and the third is PI 3-kinase activation and cell cycle progression. Furthermore, esculetin also reduced activation of RAS, a shared upstream event of the above signaling cascades ( [Pan et al., 2003](#b41-bt-27-254)). Honokiol inhibited the TNF--induced proliferation and migration of rat aortic smooth muscle cells in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with honokiol blocked expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, activation phosphorylation by TNF- ( [Zhu al., 2014](#b71-bt-27-254)). These Table 5. (2003)](#b41-bt-27-254) [Zhu et al. (2014)](#b71-bt-27-254) INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF MEDICINAL HERBS ON PLAQUE FORMATION Atherosclerosis is characterized by the narrowing and hardening of arteries following the buildup of plaque, which is composed of substances found in the blood, such as fat, cholesterol, and calcium. Plaque blocks the artery and disrupts blood flow around body, leading to life-threatening conditions. The modulatory effects of salvianolic acid B, the most abundant bioactive compound from S. miltiorrhiza, were evaluated on activated platelet-induced inflammation in endothelial cells ( [Xu et al., 2014](#b61-bt-27-254)). This compound inhibited ADP or -thrombin-induced human platelets aggregation in platelet-rich plasma samples in a dose-dependent manner in a platelet aggregation assay, and significantly reduced the release of soluble P-selectin release. In addition, adhesion of ADP-activated platelets to EA.hy926 cells and NF-B activation were reduced by pre-treatment with this compound ( [Xu et al., 2014](#b61-bt-27-254)). Cryptotanshinone, another bioactive compound from S. miltiorrhiza, significantly suppressed the formation of atherosclerotic plaque and increased plaque stability in apo-E-knockout mice by suppressing the expression of LOX-1 and MMP-9 ( [Liu et al., 2015](#b31-bt-27-254)). The effects of atractylenolides on platelet function were investigated in vitro and in vivo ( [Chen et al., 2017](#b10-bt-27-254)). Atractylenolides I, II, and III are the major components of the medicinal plant Atractylodes macrocephala. Atractylenolides II and III attenuated agonist-induced platelet aggregation and ATP release from dense granules, whereas atractylenolide I did not show such effects. Atractylenolides II and III showed suppressive effects similar to those of acetylsalicylic acid on platelet activation in response fibrin develops into organ fibrosis and atherosclerosis. The ethanolic extract of Zanthoxylum nitidum main compound, toddalolactone, showed effects. suppressed binding urokinase-type activators (uPA), therefore attenuated the PAI-1/uPA complex ( [Yu et al., suppressed induced by ADP, [, and arachidonic acid. 1,6-Di-O-caffeoyl--D-glucopyranoside also revealed obvious competitive effects on thromboxane prostanoid (TP) P2Y12 receptors, aggregometer, was found to show associated of platelet aggregation ( [Moon al., 2012](#b33-bt-27-254)). Table al. (2017)](#b14-bt-27-254) [Moon et al. (2012)](#b33-bt-27-254) CONCLUSION This review highlighted recent studies of effective herbs in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis. Herbs have long been used for medicinal purposes and are still widely used today, although elucidation of their therapeutic efficacies and mechanisms has only recently begun. We reviewed most articles concerning herbs that are effective for the treatment of atherosclerosis and classified them into six categories according to their MOAs. The experiments reviewed in this article were conducted with either herbal extracts or pure compounds isolated from herbs. The mechanisms of herbal compounds were diverse, such as blood lipid-lowering activities, inhibition of monocyte recruitment and activation, anti-inflammatory effects, anti-oxidative effects, inhibition of the infiltration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, and inhibition of plaque formation. Certain medicinal herb-derived compounds such as salvianolic acid B, cryptotanshinone, and protocatechualdehyde did not show not specific MOAs, suggesting that they exhibited anti-atherosclerotic activities via multiple mechanisms. In addition to this, there may be more specific and detailed mechanisms. Moreover, most of the compounds act not just via one mechanism, but in several ways. In conclusion, many reports suggest that herbal compounds are effective in the treatment of atherosclerosis. However, one should note that because in vivo studies have been conducted using laboratory animals such as rabbits and rats in most cases, the results and efficacies may not be the same in humans. Moreover, in the studies using plant extracts rather than pure compounds, the proportion of active compounds may differ even in the same kind of herbs as the production environment affects the contents of herbal compounds. Further studies including more subjects are needed for better understanding of herbal compounds, and we hope that this review will be helpful for future studies.
