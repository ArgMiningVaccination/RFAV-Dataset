The determination is upheld. The patient was admitted to the hospital, transferred to the hospital's inpatient psychiatry unit and then returned to the hospital due to increased frequency of non-epileptic seizures and parental concern for his safety at home during these episodes. At issue is whether the requested health service/treatment of rehab treatment-treatment in an acute rehabilitation facility is medically necessary. The requested health service of acute inpatient rehabilitation is not medically necessary for this patient. The patient is medically stable, he is already at a contact guard assistance (CGA) to supervision level for transfers and over 2 weeks ago he was walking a few steps with CGA and occasional minimum assistance (MINA). Although his non-epileptic seizures are very disturbing for the patient as well as his family, there is not support for close, 3 times (x)/week, physician oversight or aggressive physical/occupational therapy. The patient has diagnoses significant for pelvic floor dysfunction, chronic abdominal and pelvic pain and non-epileptic seizures (conversion disorder with pseudo seizures). He has received an extensive medical workup with a video electroencephalogram (vEEG) within normal limits with multiple captured episodes. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not show any evidence of an osteitis pubis (further workup for pelvic pain). He remains medically stable. While the information does support that the patient can participate in a minimum of 15 hours of therapy/week, the rehabilitation goals could be met at a lower level of care. The patient was independent with bed mobility, required CGA to supervision for transfers and was ambulating 12 feet (') with CGA and occasional MINA. In addition, while the patient continues to have non-epileptic seizures, frequent physician visits, 3x/week or more, are not supported as the patient is medically stable and treatment revolves around psychiatric care with additional rehabilitation, both of which can be provided at a lower level of care. 1) Arnouk A1, De E2, Rehfuss A1, Cappadocia C1, Dickson S1, Lian F1.
