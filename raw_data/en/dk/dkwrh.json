However, only a few mucosal vaccines have been approved for human use in the clinic. Effective mucosal immunization requires the delivery of immunogenic agents to appropriate mucosal surfaces, which remains significantly challenging due to the essential biological barriers presenting at mucosal tissues. In the past decade, remarkable progress has been made in the development of pulmonary mucosal nanovaccines. The nanovaccines leverage advanced nanoparticle-based pulmonary delivery technologies on the characteristics of large surface area and rich antigen presentation cell environment of the lungs for triggering robust immune protection against various mucosal diseases. Herein, we review current methods and formulations of pulmonary delivery, discuss the design strategies of mucosal nanovaccines for potent and long-lasting immune responses, and highlight recent advances in the application of lipid-based pulmonary nanovaccines against mucosal diseases. These advances promise to accelerate the development of novel mucosal nanovaccines for the prophylaxis and therapy of infectious diseases, and cancer, as well as autoimmune disorders at mucosal tissues.

Nanoparticles can be tailored to facilitate antigens and/or adjuvants/immunostimulators to overcome the delivery barriers and elicit robust protective mucosal immune responses.| Currently, mucosal nanovaccines are urgently needed for not only COVID-19, but also many other mucosal diseases caused by enteric pathogens, sexually and urogenital tracts cover the largest exposure surface areas of a human body. [5,6](#cit5) These tissues form a highly specialized adaptive and innate mucosal immune system, which contains mucus as the first barrier against enteric pathogenic microorganisms and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALTs) for providing protective immune responses. [5,6,9](#cit5) Mucosal vaccination has potential beneficials over conventional parenteral vaccination since it stimulates both systemic and mucosal immune defenses. [10](#cit10) A key characteristic of mucosal adaptive immune response is the local production and secretory of immunoglobin A (IgA) antibodies. Secretory IgA (sIgA) facilitates entrapment and clearance of pathogenic antigens or microorganisms in the mucus, thus effectively excluding pathogen invasion at the mucosal sites. [5,6,11](#cit5) The other important characteristic is the generation of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs), which offer rapid protection in the tissue by recruiting circulating memory T cells and producing inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. [12,13](#cit12) Moreover, the crosstalk between mucosal compartments allows immunization at one mucosal surface to establish immunity at distant mucosal sites. Taken together, mucosal vaccination holds great promise in the control of mucosal diseases. Recently, a head-to-head comparison study was performed to investigate the protection activity of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, a chimpanzee adenoviral vaccine encoding stabilized spike protein [Fig. 2b](#imgfig2)). [14](#cit14) It found that a single-dose intranasal vaccination could evoke strong systemic and mucosal IgA and T cell responses in mice to almost completely prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in both upper and lower respiratory tracts, whereas intramuscular immunization was only able to activate systemic immune responses that partially reduced lung infections. [14](#cit14) This study clearly suggests that the route of immunization exerts a substantial impact on vaccine efficacy. However, a majority of vaccines in use today are administrated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous route. There are only nine mucosal vaccines are approved for human use, including eight oral vaccines against cholera, rotavirus, poliovirus, and salmonella, and one intranasally administrated live attenuated influenza vaccine. [4](#cit4) However, oral vaccines need to survive harsh acidic environment in the stomach as well as to overcome variable pH conditions and the tight monolayer of endothelial cells lining throughout the gastrointestinal tract. [15](#cit15) Intranasal delivery have risks of exposing therapeutics to the central nervous system (CNS), [16,17](#cit16) which may cause adverse side effects. Therefore, continuous efforts are highly desired to develop safe and effective mucosal vaccines. Recently, pulmonary vaccine delivery has attracted increasing attention due to the large surface area and the rich antigen presentation cells (APCs) as desired vaccine target cells in the microenvironment of lung tissue. [18](#cit18) Pulmonary vaccination has demonstrated successful control of respiratory pathogen infections, lung cancer metastasis, and even sexually transmitted viral infections. [13,19](#cit13) |Fig. 2 Mucosal vaccines are urgently needed for mucosal diseases and they have potential benefits over conventional parenteral vaccination. (a) Burden of mucosal diseases with unmet vaccine needs. In addition to their centrality in the pathogenesis of infectious disease, mucosal tissues are frequent sites of infectious disease and respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Reproduced with permission.| In this review, we briefly overview the methods and formulations of pulmonary drug delivery. Then, we discuss the key factors that need to be considered in the design of delivery vectors, including the overcoming of pulmonary mucosal barriers, specific targeting of pulmonary epithelial and immune cells, as well as co-delivery of adjuvants and/or cytokines with antigens. We also highlight some significant achievements of lipid-based pulmonary mucosal nanovaccines in literature. Finally, we provide our perspectives on the future possibilities and challenges in pulmonary delivery technologies as well as in the development of mucosal nanovaccines. For liquid preparations, stability is a major challenge due to the high molecular mobility, which requires the use of cold chains for storage and transportation. One solution to enhance the stability is to carefully adjust the pH and osmolarity of the vehicles, as well as the ionic strength of the buffering salts. [20,23](#cit20) In most cases, the vaccines remain their maximum activity in the pH range of 5-8, and have a better stability at low osmolarity of the vehicles as well as relatively low ionic strength (I < 0.15) of the buffering salts. [24,25](#cit24) Another solution is to first freeze dry the vaccines and then reconstitute them before use. In this approach, both antigen and delivery vectors need to avoid intermolecular reactions and remain stable during the freezing and dehydration. Recently, the Anderson group synthesized hyperbranched mRNA) were nebulized to mice by using a vibrating mesh nebulizer connected to a whole-body chamber ( [Fig. 3b](#imgfig3)). This nebulization process didn't polyplexes kDa polyethylenimine (bPEI)-packed mRNA were subjected to nebulized delivery to mice. After 24 hours, all mice were sacrificed and major organs were collected for bioluminescence imaging. As shown in [Fig. 3e](#imgfig3), positive signals were only localized in the lungs but not in the spleen and liver, which was significantly different from the biodistribution after intravenous injection. The luminescent radiance in lungs was quantified to be 4.8 \u00d7 105 p s1 cm2 sr1 and in the hDD90-118 and hC32-118 groups, respectively, which were much higher than that in the bPEI control group (2.9 \u00d7 104 p s1 cm2 sr1) ( [Fig. agreement with radiance values, mRNA-hPBAE polyplexes induced a more efficient luciferase protein production than mRNA-bPEI ( [Fig. 3e](#imgfig3)). This study demonstrated that hPBAE is an effective pulmonary delivery vector for nucleic acid therapeutics, which could find broad applications in the control of many diseases. [27,28](#cit27) |Fig. 3 Pulmonary delivery with different devices and formulations. (a-e) Delivery of liquid formulations with a nebulizer.

Reproduced with permission.| Further, dry powder formulations are also associated with the complication of stability. This can be mitigated by adding stabilizers such as carbohydrate matrices. [20](#cit20) Moreover, their particle size is an essential concern. It requires careful adjustment to achieve good dispersion, low aggregation, and low-adhesive properties, in order to allow efficient release from an inhaler as well as to achieve desired deposition and distribution in the lungs. [20,22,29-31](#cit20) Common drying processes used in vaccine preparations include spray drying, freeze drying, air drying, or a hybrid of them. Very recently, Cui et al. judiciously studied the impact of drying processes on the aerosol performance properties of solid lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) freeze drying (TFFD), spray-freeze drying, or conventional shelf freeze drying. The TFFD-dried SLNs had a fluffy porous microstructure, showing approximately 20 times larger surface areas than the beads-like spray-freeze and PDI (0.24 \u00b1 0.09); while the spray-freeze drying process induced slightly increase in the particle size and 50% enhancement in PDI (0.41 \u00b1 0.06); in contrast, the shelf freeze drying process almost tripled particle size and PDI (0.82 \u00b1 0.19), which required further processing such as milling for size reduction in order to be used in inhalable delivery. In addition, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-encapsulated LNPs can be successfully converted into aerosolizable dry powder by TFFD and remained their particle size, size distribution ( [Fig. 3h and i](#imgfig3)) and the function of siRNA unchanged after reconstitution. Therefore, TFFD represented the optimal drying process for aerosolizable SLNs. Despite excellent dispersion and low aggregation, the LNP composition and TFFD parameters need to be further optimized for animal studies. And the TFFD may not be superior to other drying methods for delivery vectors that different from LNPs. Mucus presents a highly heterogeneous and viscous microenvironment. It functions as the body's first line of defense to entrap and rapidly remove foreign invaders such as pathogens and nanovaccines. To effectively overcome the mucosal barriers, nanoparticles must find a balance between mucoadhesion and mucosal penetration, which strongly depends on the residence time of mucosal layers as well as their thickness. [42](#cit42) Nanoparticles need to across the mucosal layers before being subjected to mucus clearance. In general, nanoparticles with neutral surface charge and great hydrophilicity would have enhanced mucosal penetration, while positively charged or highly hydrophobicity promotes mucoadhesion due to their interactions with negatively charged mucus layers. [43,44](#cit43) For example, surface modification of nanoparticles with surfactant poloxmer 188 increased mucosal diffusion and cellular uptake. [23](#cit23) Polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating influenced both mucoadhesion and mucosal penetration performance according to the length of chains and surface density. [45](#cit45) It was demonstrated that nanoparticles with long PEG chains (10 kDa) had more interactions with mucus glycoproteins for improved adhesion, and those with shorter PEG chains (2 kDa) were associated with better mucosal diffusion. Moreover, increasing the surface PEG density of nanoparticles could efficiently enhance mucosal penetration. [46](#cit46) On this basis, Suk et al. epoxide The cationic carbon nanocluster TPFE is an attractive delivery vector for gene transfer agents, [48,49](#cit48) for example, plasmid DNA encoding fluorescent Zsgreen diameters of pZG/TPFE-PEG remained unchanged ( [Fig. 4b](#imgfig4)). This was attributed to the PEGylation, which helped to resist mucoadhesive interactions. To further investigate the PEGylation effect in vivo, TPFE nanoparticles were engineered with either pZG or plasmid DNA encoding luciferase (pGL3) for pulmonary administration. The nanoparticle distribution in lungs was examined by confocal imaging, which showed widespread and uniform transgene expression in lung tissue sections of pZG/TPFE-PEG-treated wild-type C57BL/6 mice (>65% coverage). In contrast, negligible fluorescent signals were observed in both pZG and pZG/TPFE control groups (<2% coverage) ( [Fig. 4c and d](#imgfig4)). These results well agreed with the overall level of transgene expression that was measured by lung homogenate-based luciferase assays. Pulmonary delivery of pGL3/TPFE-PEG induced two orders of magnitude higher luciferase activity compared to naked pGL3 or pGL3/TPFE in lungs of wild-type C57BL/6 mice ( [Fig. 4d](#imgfig4)). Similar results were observed in a chronic lung disease transgenic Scnn1b-Tg mouse model, which featured mucus accumulation and stasis. Although encountering more challenging delivery barriers, the TPFE-PEG delivery system remained their mucosal penetration capacity and induced a widespread (35% coverage) as well as high-level overall transgene expression in the lungs of Scnn1b-Tg mice ( [Fig. 4c and d](#imgfig4)). Collectively, PEG surface coating could endow nanoparticles with the capacity to overcome essential mucosal barriers in the lungs, even in pathological conditions characterized by the strengthened barrier properties. |Fig. 4 PEGylation strategy to facilitate overcoming of mucosal barriers to delivery vectors.

Without proper targeting, the cargo antigens may not induce efficient cellular internalization and antigen cross-presentation. Undoubtedly, targeting APCs in the lungs is an attractive approach to address this problem. The target receptors that have been extensively explored in parenteral nanovaccines can apply to the design of mucosal nanovaccines, for example, the well-characterized dendritic cell (DC) receptor [50](#cit50) and mannose receptor. [51,52](#cit51) In addition to APCs, pulmonary epithelial cells represent another important cell component for targeting mucosal nanovaccines. In particular, the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is overexpressed on some type I mucosal epithelial cells and involved in the bidirectionally transepithelial transport of IgG and proteins, [53](#cit53) providing great opportunities for targeted delivery of protein-based or protein hitchhiking-mediated nanovaccines. [13,54](#cit13) Moreover, M cell-targeted strategy can achieve highly effective mucosal immune responses. [42,55,56](#cit42) The most widely investigated is ulex agglutinin 1 (UEA-1), [56,57](#cit56) which bind to -L-fucose residues on the surfaces of murine intestinal M cells. Nevertheless, the targeting ligands of pulmonary M cells were seldomly reported. To identify an effective pulmonary M-cell targeting strategy, the M cell characteristics should be taken into consideration as highlighted by Longet et al. in 2018. [55](#cit55) Despite effective delivery, mucosal nanovaccines with antigens alone may not induce sufficiently strong immune responses for long-lasting protection against viruses associated with mucosal diseases. [58,59](#cit58) Co-delivery adjuvants/immunostimulators with antigens could significantly potentiate mucosal immunization. [54,60](#cit54) This strategy has been verified by using polymeric nanoparticle delivery systems, such as poly-(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), poly(lactic acid) (PLA), and chitosan, which could simultaneously act as mucosal adjuvants and delivery vectors in nanovaccines. [56,61,62](#cit56) In most cases, however, adjuvants need to be delivered separately. [60](#cit60) For example, a phosphatidylserine (PS)-coated and stimulator immunity against lung metastases ( [Fig. 5a](#imgfig5)). [63](#cit63) Notably, in NP-cGAMP, the exposed PS functioned as the \"eat-me\" signal, which could be recognized and internalized by APCs through their PS receptors. The cGAMP was expected to release in cytosol, bind to STING in APCs, stimulate STING signaling and type I interferons production, and finally promote pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment for increased immune protection. The NP-cGAMP and its counterparts had an average diameter of around 120 nm ( [Fig. 5b and c](#imgfig5)). After inhalation, the aerosolized NP-cGAMP predominately resided in lung tissues at a relatively high concentration for at least 48 hours, which was attributed to the PS-mediated APC targeting ( [Fig. 5d](#imgfig5)). with fractionated radiation (IR) could successfully activate anticancer immunity in a B16F10-OVA tumor metastasis model. In animal studies, fractionated IR was only delivered to the right lung of mice, which resulted in successful tumor inhibition in the right lung but little therapeutic efficacy against metastatic foci in the non-irradiated left lung. The mice treated with inhalable NP-cGAMP caused a moderate reduction in the number of tumor foci in both lungs. Impressively, combination of NP-cGAMP and fractionated IR (right lung only) induced almost complete tumor regression in both lungs ( [Fig. 5e and f](#imgfig5)). These data demonstrated that pulmonary delivery of immunostimulators, especially by using APC-targeting delivery vectors, could synergize with in situ tumor antigen release and enhance protective immunity against tumor development at the lung tissue. However, this study didn't take mucosal immune responses into careful considerations when exploring the mechanisms behind the synergistic therapeutic effects. A more comprehensive analysis of the protective immunity would be needed before applying the NP-cGAMP delivery strategy to other pulmonary nanovaccines. Although adjuvants could potentiate antigen-specific immune responses, an improper adjuvant may result in severe side effects. For example, an enterotoxin-adjuvanted nasal influenza vaccine caused a substantial number of Bell's palsy in a clinical trial, which was attributed to the high binding affinity between enterotoxin and GM1 ganglioside moieties of olfactory nerves. [64-66](#cit64) Pollen grains have been reported as an adjuvant to elicit allergic immune response and promote DC maturation, [67](#cit67) which therefore should be taken into consideration for the design of pulmonary vaccines. A pulmonary vaccine with too strong adjuvants may be at higher risks for triggering allergy, especially when it is administrated in pollen seasons. |Fig. 5 APC-targeting and immunostimulator co-delivery strategies to improve protective immunity at mucosal sites.

On day 5, after confirming development of multifocal metastases in both lungs, the mice were treated with fractionated radiation to the right lung (IR, 8 Gy \u00d7 3), inhalation of NP-cGAMP (24 h after each IR for three doses), or a combination of them. NP-CTR (25-GpAp) served as a control of NP-cGAMP. To deplete pulmonary APCs, NP-clodronate was administered via inhalation 6 h before each of the three NP-cGAMP inhalations. To deplete CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, anti-CD4 Ab or anti-CD8 Ab was injected intraperitoneal (i.p.) (400 g), respectively, one day before IR and repeated 7 days later.

Very recently, Ming et al. prepared a bionic virus-like nanovaccine that comprised viral \"capsid\"-mimicking pulmonary vectors, viral genetic material-mimicking poly(I:C) (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid) as adjuvants, and \"spike\"-mimicking receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins on the liposome surfaces as antigens. This inhalable mucosal vaccine elicited respiratory secretions, effectively neutralized intranasally delivered pseudovirus, and demonstrated a much stronger mucosal protective immune responses than subcutaneous vaccination. [71](#cit71) It is worth noting that the lamellarity of liposomes can greatly impact the vaccine immunization with interbilayer-crosslinked to activate and antigen specific effector memory T cells (TEms) at multiple mucosal sites. [19](#cit19) The ICMVs were first reported by the Irvine group in 2011. [72](#cit72) They were composed molar ratio of 4:1:5. To synthesize them, simple liposomes were first prepared and fused to multilamellar vesicles (MLVs), in which functionalized lipid headgroups ICMVs allowed stable in the core and lipid-based immunostimulators in their multi-layer walls under extracellular conditions and rapid release of the cargoes in cell endosomes, therefore promoting antigen cross-presentation and eliciting robust humoral and cellular immune responses upon subcutaneous injection. [72](#cit72) In their following-up study, ICMVs were employed to pack antigen OVA and two TLR agonists, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and poly(I:C), for pulmonary To investigate the distant mucosal immunity, luciferase-expressing OT-1 CD8+ T cells (OT-1-luc) were intravenousely into mice twenty-four hours prior to intratracheal or subcutaneous administration of ICMV or soluble vaccines. According to bioluminescence imaging on day 3, T cell proliferation was only observed in draining lymph nodes (dLNs) in all vaccinated mice. In contrast, by day 5, higher T cell expansion was observed in the pulmonary ICMV group, showing bioluminescent signals in not only lymph nodes and spleen but also reproductive tracts and gut ( [Fig. 6b](#imgfig6)). These results indicated the unique mucosal homing property of T cell responses in mucosal immunization, which was attributed to the substantial expression of mucosal homing integrin 47 receptors in the tetramer+ peripheral blood OT-1 cells after pulmonary vaccination ( [Fig. 6c](#imgfig6)). Moreover, pulmonary ICMV vaccination biased T cell responses toward effector memory phenotype at both local and distal mucosal tissues. When tested in subcutaneous OVA-expressing B16F10 mouse melanoma tumor model, ICMV OVA pulmonary vaccination led to complete tumor rejection and long-term survival (over 18 weeks) of all animals. In contrast, soluble OVA pulmonary vaccination delayed tumor growth but failed to improve ultimate survival of mice ( [Fig. 6d](#imgfig6)). Similar results were observed in prophylactic models ( [Fig. 6e](#imgfig6)). Collectively, pulmonary ICMV nanovaccine could prime TEMs that circulated to both local and distal mucosal tissues as well as systemic compartments, therefore providing robust protection in both therapeutic tumor and prophylactic viral infection settings. Further evaluation on the safety and efficacy of ICMV mucosal nanovaccines that carrying antigens of relevant mucosal disease, such as mucosal tumors and HIV, would provide significant guidance for their bench-to-bed translation. |Fig. 6 Liposome nanoparticle-based are prepared from dried lipid films, (ii) divalent cations are added to induce fusion of liposomes and the formation of multilamellar vesicles (MLVs), apposed lipid bilayers in the vesicle walls, and (iv) the resulting lipid particles are PEGylated with thiol-terminated PEG.

Reproduced with permission.| addition to liposome nanoparticles, lipid conjugates with \"albumin or molecular adjuvants (amph-vaccines) to dLNs. In this strategy, the lipid tail of the amph-vaccines served as an albumin-binding domain. Upon injection, endogenous albumin was bound to and chaperoned amph-vaccines to dLNs, and then transferred the lipid tails from albumin to insert in cell membranes. [33,74](#cit33) The Irvine group explored this amph-vaccine approach in pulmonary vaccination on the basis that (1) albumin is abundant in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of na\u00efve mice and its concentration can be rapidly increased from approximate 200 g mL1 to a few mg mL1 after pulmonary administration of the TLR9 agonist CpG; (2) FcRn is highly expressed on pulmonary epithelial cells, which can facilitate the transportation of albumin across the airway epithelium. [13](#cit13) The amph-vaccines comprised a PEG spacer peptide antigen gp10020-39 and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE) phospholipid tail as well as a C18 adjuvant CpG DNA ( [Fig. 7a](#imgfig7)). The amph-gp100 conjugates led to about 10 times higher accumulation in the lung parenchyma than free gp100 peptide 24 h after intratracheal administration, and remained easily detectable in lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs) at 48 h ( [Fig. 7b-d](#imgfig7)). Similar results were found in the amph-CpG conjugates. Importantly, pulmonary vaccination with amph-vaccines stimulated prolonged antigen presentation in MLNs for over two weeks, high levels of antigen-specific lung TRMs, and enhanced protection against viral and tumor challenge. In a prophylactic viral infection model, mice were first intratracheally immunized with amph-AL11/amph-CpG vaccines, in which AL11 is a murine gag peptide. After five months, the mice were challenged with a lethal dose of gag epitope-expressing Vaccinia virus ( [Fig. 7e](#imgfig7)). All mice immunized with pulmonary amph-vaccines survived. In control groups, mice kept losing body weight and succumbed by day 7 ( [Fig. 7f and g](#imgfig7)). To test the protective capacity in tumor models, the antigens of the amph-vaccines in [Fig. 7e](#imgfig7) were replaced with a combination of three melanoma peptides (Trp1455-463, Trp2180-188, and gp10020-39) and mice were challenged 30 days after full vaccination by intravenously injecting B16F10 melanoma cells. According to survive curves in [Fig. 7h](#imgfig7), 80% mice in the pulmonary vaccine group survived at 100 days after the tumor inoculation, while only 40% mice were protected by subcutaneous vaccination. Taken together, pulmonary amph-vaccines primed long-lived antigen-specific TRMs in the lungs, generated robust mucosal immunity, and effectively protected against viral or tumor challenge. |Fig. 7 Albumin-binding lipid-based pulmonary vaccine. schematic diacyl lipid tail conjugated to CpG.

LNPs are usually constructed by four lipid components: (1) ionizable/cationic lipids that protect the cargoes and facilitate endosomal escape, (2) PEG-lipids that stabilize the LNPs and protect them from opsonization, (3) cholesterol that promotes cellular endocytosis, and (4) other helper lipids such as phospholipids that support the LNP structure. [75,76](#cit75) Each component and their molar ratio can be carefully tuned to efficiently deliver nucleic acid therapeutics to hepatocytes. [77-79](#cit77) Recently, the Siegwart research group engineered LNPs with a fifth lipid component and achieved liver-, spleen-, or lung-specific delivery after intravenous injection of the [75](#cit75) In brief, addition of cationic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammoniumpropane (DOTAP) was identified to be a key regulator of the selective organ targeting (SORT), which shifted the accumulation of LNPs from liver to spleen to lung by increasing its molar percentages from 0 to 100% in the LNPs. Anionic lipid 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (18PA) (at a molar ratio of 10-40%) was screened for spleen-targeted delivery. In addition, they found that ionizable cationic lipids such as 1,2-dioleoyl-3-dimethylammonium-propane (DODAP) (at a molar ratio of 20%) did not affect biodistribution but could increase mRNA delivery to the liver. [75](#cit75) LNPs have been used in the intramuscular delivery of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and are exerting a broad impact on the activation of potent systemic immune protection against SARS-CoV-2. They can also be applied to the delivery of mucosal nanovaccines. For example, rectal delivery of LNPs containing Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and MPLA adjuvant induced strong systemic and robust mucosal immunity. [80](#cit80) Further encapsulation of this HBsAg nanovaccine into enteric-coated minicapsules converted it to an oral nanovaccine, which can target the colonic region upon oral delivery and induce significant immune protection against hepatitis B. [81](#cit81) Few studies have been reported for using LNPs in pulmonary vaccination thus far. Notably, upon pulmonary delivery, LNPs would interact with proteins, biomolecules, cells, and physical barriers in the airway, which are different from those they would interact with in systemic delivery. [9](#cit9) In addition, the shearing stress from nebulizers or inhalers may disrupt the LNP structures. [82](#cit82) Therefore, LNP formulations that succeed in parenteral administration may need further optimization for pulmonary delivery. Very recently, Lokugamage et al. established an in vivo workflow to systematically study how different lipid components in LNPs affected their nebulized delivery oligomer-lipid conjugate 7C1-baed LNPs by varying the molar ratio and structure of PEG-lipids, the charge of phospholipids, and the presence or absence of cholesterol. They found that PEG-lipids, rather than cholesterol and helper lipids, were the key regulators of the formation of stable 7C1-based LNPs for nebulized delivery. A higher PEG content and cationic helper lipids in LNPs could improve mRNA delivery. The optimized LNPs were composed of 7C1, cholesterol, C14-PEG2000, and 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane (DOTAP) at a molar ratio of 35:5:55:5, which could efficiently deliver mRNA-encoding neutralizing antibody to protect mice from influenza A viruses. Moreover, nebulized delivery of NLD1 demonstrated excellent biosafety. Compared with untreated controls, NLD1 caused only 6 of 547 inflammatory genes in the lung tissues that increased by more than two-fold at 4 h after the exposure, whereas that in the mild-dose lipopolysaccharides (LPS) control group was 86 out of 547 inflammatory genes. In addition, nebulized delivery of NLD1 didn't induce significant loss of mouse body weights within 24 hours, further supporting excellent tolerability even at early timepoints. [82](#cit82) Taken together, the NLD1 LNPs hold great potential to be safe and effective delivery nanocarriers for pulmonary vaccines. In this review, we summarized recent design strategies and progresses of pulmonary mucosal nanovaccines. We mainly discussed the improvement in the design of nanocarriers for vaccines. Other critical parameters, such as antigen selection and expression, antigen/adjuvant stability in mucosal environment, administration doses and timing of antigens/adjuvants, mucosal immunity measurement, and prime-boost combination with parenteral vaccination are also critical for the pulmonary vaccines to induce the optimal immune responses. Furthermore, the accessibility of storage, transportation, and massive immunization should also be considered for the successful clinical translation and commercialization of pulmonary mucosal nanovaccines. Notably, the crosstalk between mucosal compartments allows pulmonary nanovaccines to provide protection against not only lung infections but also reproductive or gastrointestinal tract pathogens, for instance, HIV/AIDS. [6](#cit6) Moreover, the pulmonary delivery strategies can also be expanded to the delivery of therapeutic agents other than vaccines for alternative approaches of mucosal disease treatment. For example, nebulized delivery of lung spheroid cell exosome-based nanodecoys accelerated the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 mimics from the lungs without apparent toxicity. [83](#cit83) In another study, nebulized delivery of PBAE polymer formulated Cas13a mRNA efficiently degraded influenza or SARS-CoV-2 RNA in lung tissue, mitigated influenza virus A or SARS-CoV-2 replication, and reduced disease symptoms in rodents. [27](#cit27) Besides, intratracheal administration of multiplexing activity-based nanosensors achieved sensitive and specific lung cancer detection. [84](#cit84) Combination of pulmonary nanovaccines with these applications may provide new solutions for the management of mucosal diseases. Taken together, pulmonary mucosal nanovaccines will provide powerful tools for preventing infection and transmission of mucosal pathogens, as well as for the treatment of pre-existing diseases such as infections and cancer at mucosal sites and other distant tissues. |This journal is \u00a9 The Royal "}
