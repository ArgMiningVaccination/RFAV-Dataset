I dare you to look at the label on the back... As a Beauty Editor, hundreds of products cross my desk every week, and I'm all for swatching and slathering them to test out what works (and what doesn't). But with all the product testing I started thinking about what's actually in these lotions and potions, and whether the amount of synthetic chemicals we're putting on our bodies every day is actually a good idea? The jury is out on that I'm afraid. But if you've been thinking about taking a more natural approach, it's well worth looking into the world of synthetic chemical-free, non-toxic beauty, and no, that doesn't mean you have to start wearing hemp or walking around bare foot. Natural beauty products can be just as effective (and cool) as the regular stuff, here's the proof... Ila Apothecary Silk Eye Serum, \u00a337 I like my eye creams to soothe, moisturise and freshen the under-eye area, and this one does all that (and then some). The all-natural and organic formula contains Liquorice to minimise the appearance of age spots and dark circles, and hyaluronic acid to give a much-needed boost of hydration for dry eyes. After a few days I noticed it had helped to fade the dehydration lines around my eyes, whilst leaving the overall texture of my skin smooth and plump. Green People Zap & Clear Serum, \u00a314 Waking up with a huge spot is never fun, so keep Green People's Zap & Clear Serum on hand. The clever blend of natural ingredients helps to calm and soothe redness quickly, taking down any spots before they have the chance to erupt. If I felt a spot coming on I simply loaded it up with this gel and 9 times out of 10 it prevent the breakout from happening. Evolve Organic Beauty Hyaluronic 200 Serum, \u00a312 Do you ever look at your skin in the mirror and feel like it's just a bit bleh? Maybe it's just me, but somedays my face looks dull, tired, and like i've been up all night - even though I'm a grandma and like to go to bed at 10pm. Whenever my skin gets like this I slather my face in Evolve's Hyaluronic Acid Serum. Not only is it 99.3% natural (which means it's made up of non-toxic, non-synthetic ingredients), but it's like a big drink of water for thirsty skin. Pop it on before any moisturiser and it'll get rid of all signs of dehydration. Dr Hauschka Clarifying Day Oil, \u00a326.50 I LOVE Dr Hauschka's clarifying face oil, my skin can bounce between being super-dry and super-oily, so when it's on the oilier side I reach for this. Don't ask me how it does it, but somehow the formula 'balances my skin' and brings it back to a happy medium. It reduces shine, calms redness, and actually helps to prevent breakouts before they happen. Herbivore Pink Cloud Rosewater Moisture Cream, \u00a342 Not only are Herbivore products all-natural, but they're also made for the 'gram. Don't let the paired-back packaging fool you though, this brand means business when it comes to ingredients. The Pink Cloud Moisturiser may be totally free of synthetics, but it's packed with super-effective, good-for-your-skin naturals, including Rose Water, Aloe Water, Kukui Oil and White Tea Extract. Plus, the moisturiser's lightweight formula absorbed in seconds, without leaving my skin greasy. Botanicals Gentle Moisturiser, \u00a324.50 I've fast become a BIG fan of [Botanicals](https://www.botanicals.co.uk/). The brand carries a seal of approval from [The Soil Association](https://www.soilassociation.org/), which means that their products are of the highest standard in organic beauty. Whilst the natural beauty market is saturated with face oils (and some wonderful face oils at that) Botanicals Gentle Moisturiser offers a nice change of pace when you want something that absorbs quickly and leaves the skin residue-free. If you're into all natural beauty, it's well worth checking them out. MV Organics Rose Plus Booster Oil, \u00a377, & MV Organics Rose Soothing Protective Moisturiser, \u00a326 These two are my go-to for hormonal skin days. Once a month (without fail) I'll get a couple of those nasty cystic spots - you know the ones that feel like you have a an actual grape sitting under the surface of your skin? Well this duo is the only combination of products that vastly improve my hormonal flare ups. I'll mix a few drops of the Rose Plus oil in with the moisturiser, the high quality essential oils (including rosehip and jojoba) soothe and help promote healing, so they cut the life of those cystic spots in half. Instead of being plagued with breakouts for over a week, my skin is back to it's former glory in a day or two. MV Organics Rose Plus Booster Oil, \u00a377 [buy Bjork & Berries Birch Recovery Face Oil, \u00a319.50 The natural beauty world is brimming with oils, all of which claim to save your poor skin and deliver it to glowy greatness. Well, I tried a lot, throughout my natural skincare journey, and out of the bunch, this was one of the very best... Yep, Swedish brand, Bjork & Berries have managed to create the perfect non-greasy face oil that gives a plenty of nourishment, and glow. Tata Harper Nourishing Cleansing Oil, \u00a366 I know what you're thinking. \u00a366 for a cleanser is pretty steep, but when it comes to natural skin care Tata Harper go the extra mile. Every single product is handmade by one of their employees, and nothing sits around on a shelf for longer than 2 weeks, so you can be sure the stuff you're slathering on your face is fresh. This cleansing oil is incredibly rich, it breaks down dirt and makeup on the face in a matter of seconds. Expect skin to feel clean, but not stripped of moisture. Pai Back To Life Hydration Serum, \u00a342 I'm a long time lover of Pai skincare, the natural beauty brand are always my go-to when I'm looking to try something new. Their latest offering is a Hydration Serum that gives an extra boost of much-needed moisture when loaded on before face cream. Dry skin sufferers, this one's for you. Romilly Wilde Light + Energy Serum Cleanser, \u00a354 This super-luxe balmy cleanser can be worked into the skin to melt away makeup and leave the complexion clean and fresh. I used it whenever I wanted a more 'pampered' approach to my end of day routine, unlike a regular face wash the balm melts into an oil, and then transforms into a milky finish once water is added. It cleans skin beautifully, and kept my face feel soft and hydrated. Ila Apothecary Warming Anti-Breakout Face Mask, \u00a327 When it comes to aesthetics, Ila Apothecary, is one of the best-looking brands around. The paired-back approach to packaging means that the brand is up there with the chicest shelfie material. This warming anti-breakout face mask does exactly what it says on the tube, help put a stop to spots. The blend of black cumin, manuka and magnolia bark helps to rebalance sebum production and soothe any existing pimples. Shiro Aloe & Rugosa Rose, \u00a356 Shiro doesn't get nearly enough hype in the beauty world. The Japanese skin-care brand uses only natural ingredients that help to bring your complexion back to balance with the gentle but seriously effective formulas. They don't just make skincare, the natural beauty company make haircare, fragrance and makeup too... This aloe and rose mask helped soothe my skin after a bad reaction, it calmed those irritating under-the-skin spots, and left my face looking clear. 17 vegan skincare brands you need to try The very best tanning drops for a streak-free glow We try out anti-wrinkle injections to treat TMJ The best face wash for every single skin type "}
