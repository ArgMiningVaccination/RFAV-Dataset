Is your teen getting the protein and vitamins they need? All Day Energy to the rescue! All Day Energy has 15 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber. Sweetened with monk fruit, it has NO SUGAR, no wheat, and no dairy. In vanilla or chocolate, it is delicious blended with rice, hemp or almond milk, or mixed simply with water. Say good-bye to that mid-afternoon crash and mood swings that are caused by blood sugar drops. We all need easily digestible nutrition to think clearly and charge through our day. Those with allergies and digestive stress are not assimilating all the nutrients out of the food they eat. All Day Energy features VegaPro, an all-natural pea, and rice protein blend; Aminogen\u00ae, a plant enzyme that enhances protein digestibility and absorption; and Artinia\u00ae chitin-glucan, a novel fiber that supports antioxidant systems in the body. This sugar- and stevia- free formula provides an array of micronutrients, including high-potency B12, activated B vitamins, and Albion\u00ae minerals (the real amino acid chelate system).* Directions: Mix two scoops (34 g) in 6-8 oz of cold water and consume.
