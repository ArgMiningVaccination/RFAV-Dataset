Intussusception is when one part of the intestine slides into another part (like a telescope). This causes a blockage . If this happens, it is usually within 7 days after the first dose. The risk of intussusception is even lower after the second or third dose. If your child has severe stomach swelling or pain, vomiting that will not stop or keeps coming back , blood in the ir stool, or a high fever , take them to a doctor right away . This could be intussusception. The vaccine virus may be in your baby's poop for up to 10 days after they get the vaccine. Wash your hands carefully after chang ing diapers and before touch ing food. The risk of spreading the virus after getting the vaccine is highest around day 7, but this is not common. Anyone with a weak immune system should not chang e your child's diapers for 10 days after your child had the rotavirus vaccine (if this is possible) . It is rare to have a serious side effect after a vaccine . Call Health Link at 811 to r eport any serious or unusual side effects .
