Gamertsfelder, MD, Richard Kent Zimmerman, MD, MPH, and Elizabeth G. DeSensi, MS Bacllground: Underimmunization was the primary cause of the 1990 measles outbreak in the United States. We examined the level and causes of underimmunlzation in a famUy practice residency clinic that received free vaccine supplies from the county health department. Methods: The office computer selected 286 patients aged 2 to 3 years. From these 286 patients, 175 were sampled. Their charts were audited for immunization barriers, looking specifically for (1) valid reasons; (2) overly cautious interpretation of contraindications, especially minor illnesses; (3) missed opportunities (failure to address inununization status during acute care visits or lack of simultaneous vaccine administration); (4) parental refusal; and (5) delayed immunizations resulting from gaps in clinic attendance. Results: There were 174 delayed doses; 90 were due to gaps in clinic attendance, 42 due to valid reasons, 33 due to Invalid contraindications, and 25 due to missed opportunities. Some doses were delayed on more than one occasion and for more than one reason. Two parents refused initial immunizations, claiming that the chUdren were too small. Conclusion: Important causes of delayed immunizations in this residency clinic were gaps in attendance, overly cautious interpretations of contraindications, missed opportunities, and lack of simultaneous vaccine administration. (J Am Board Fam Pract 1994; 7:100\u00b74.) The United States experienced a major measles epidemic in 1990 involving 27,786 cases! and 89 deaths,2 despite the ready availability of an effec\u00ad tive vaccine for its prevention. Major outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases, such as pertussis and mumps, have occurred as well.! According to the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC), inadequate immunization was the principal cause of the measles outbreak. 3 Almost one-half (44 percent) of the measles cases reported in 1990 occurred in unimmunized chil\u00ad dren who were old enough for immunization. 2 Childhood immunization rates at 2 years of age were low in many areas, as reflected by comple\u00ad tion rates of 10 percent, 27 percent, 38 percent, and 38 percent for 2-year-olds in Houston, Miami, Washington, DC, and Oakland, respec\u00ad tively.4 NVAC viewed the measles epidemic as a sentinel measure of the efficacy of vaccine deliv- Submitted, revised, 12 November 1993.

Surveys of parents have shown the importance of physician advice in patient acceptance of polio,6,7 measles,8 and pertussisS-lO vaccines. Physicians cannot di\u00ad recdy change some barriers, such as vaccine cost, but there are areas in which physicians can make a difference. Three of these areas involve im\u00ad munization barriers: overly cautious interpreta\u00ad tion of vaccine contraindications, missed oppor\u00ad tunities to address immunization status, and lack of simultaneous vaccine administration. Many providers have been overly cautious in interpreting vaccine contraindications.9,!!-13 For instance, in Minnesota many physicians (30 per\u00ad cent and 34 percent, respectively) would not ad\u00ad minister measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine to a child with a minor illness, such as an upper respiratory tract infection with a temperature of on 13 September 2023 by guest.

Downloaded from 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F) or watery diarrhea with ample hydration.13 Some physicians (40 percent) would not administer subsequent diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine (DTP) doses if the child was febrile (temperature, 39.4\u00b0C [103\u00b0F]) following the last DTP. Missed opportunities have occurred when a child was seen by a provider for a reason other than well-child care or immunizations, but the child's im\u00ad munization status was not addressed. In Rochester, New York, 422 of 515 children (82 percent) had a missed immunization opportunity; most contacts (64 percent) were due to mild acute illnesses. 14 In another study, only 3 of 53 children (6 percent) who were seen for a minor illness were immunized, al\u00ad though they all needed at least one immunization.12 A third barrier within the health care system has been lack of simultaneous vaccine administra\u00ad tion. In Minnesota, many physicians (33 percent) were unwilling to recommend simultaneous ad\u00ad ministration of multiple immunizations.13 Simul\u00ad taneous administration of vaccines is important, because 38 percent of measles cases in an outbreak were in children who were immunized with oral polio vaccine or DTP or both at a time when MMR could also have been given. IS The project reported here assessed five im\u00ad munization barriers in a family practice residency clinic (FPRC): (1) overly cautious interpretation of vaccine contraindications, (2) missed opportu\u00ad nities to address immunization status, (3) lack of simultaneous vaccine administration, (4) parental refusal out of concern about side effects, and (5) gaps in clinic attendance. Because the FPRC receives free vaccine supplies from the county, vac\u00ad cine cost is not an immunization barrier at this site. The family practice residency clinic is located in an urban area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The socioeconomic status of the patient population is diverse, but the majority of children are econom\u00ad ically disadvantaged. The clinic population is ra\u00ad cially diverse; 51 percent are African-American, 44 percent are white, and 5 percent are of other ethnic backgrounds. Methods The office computer selected 286 patients aged 2 to 3 years as of2 October 1991. For this project, the reports of 175 of the 286 patients were sampled. The computer has a patient status report for every patient at the FPRC. The status report contains on-line data about the patient's birth date, prob\u00ad lem list, medications, immunizations, and health maintenance information. It is updated at each patient visit, based upon the physician's dictation regarding that visit. Printed copies of the report for each (100 per\u00ad cent) of the 175 children were reviewed to assess the timeliness ofDTP-1, DTP-2, DTP-3, DTP-4, andMMR-l. A dose was defined as \"on time\" ifit was given within 1 month of recommendations. 4,16 For DTP-4, 18 months was considered accept\u00ad ableP If a child had one or more late immuni\u00ad zations, the principal investigator audited the patient's personal chart. Only one discrepancy in immunization dates was found between the patient charts and the status report. For that instance, chart data were used. For each late dose, the length of delay in administration and reason(s) for the delay were recorded by hand onto pre\u00ad printed forms. Reasons for delays were catego\u00ad rized as (1) valid (e.g., valid contraindication or awaiting transfer of immunization records from another provider to FPRC), (2) invalid, (3) immuni\u00ad zation administered by another clinic, (4) missing data about that immunization, and (5) parental refusal. Invalid reasons were subdivided as invalid contraindications, missed opportunities (e.g., im\u00ad munization status not addressed during visit for a mild, acute illness or lack of simultaneous vaccine administration), and gaps in patient attendance at the clinic. Because more than one patient visit could occur after a child was eligible for a vaccine but before the child received it, more than one invalid reason could apply per dose. Invalid con\u00ad traindications were defined from published refer\u00ad ences18,19 and typically involved a minor illness with a temperature less than 38.3\u00b0C (l01.0\u00b0F) rectally or 37 .8\u00b0C (100.0\u00b0F) axillary. Gaps in clinic attendance were defined as lack of attendance at the clinic during the recommended time for im\u00ad munization,16,17 with a I-month grace period. If no immunization data were available for a partic-' ular dose in the chart or status record, that \"dose was labeled as missing. Generally, missing doses indicated a child who either came to the FPRC at a later age and was fully immunized or a child who left the FPRC for another clinic. Five children had only one visit to the FPRC and did not have any immunization data on record; these children were excluded from further analyses, leaving 170 for the main analyses.

Downloaded from For children whose immunizations were late, their ages at immunization were calculated during chart audits. Because these age distributions were skewed (P < 0.05),20 median values were reported instead of mean values. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Analysis System21 on a mainframe computer. Results Of the 170 children, 90 were boys and 80 were girls. Insurance coverage for the 170 children included Medicaid (75 percent), commercial insurance (17 percent), and self-paylHill Burton (8 percent). The number of late immunizations for the 170 children ranged from 12 (7 percent) for DTP-l to 56 (33 percent) for MMR-l (Table 1). For children whose immunizations were late, the median age at DTP-3, DTP-4, and MMR-l was 10,24, and 18 months, respectively. The principal causes of late immunizations, in descending order, were gaps in clinic attendance, valid reasons, invalid contraindications, and missed opportunities. Many doses were delayed more than once because of repeated invalid contraindi\u00ad cations or lack of addressing immunization status at clinic visits (Table 2). Lack of simultaneous administration was considered a missed opportu\u00ad nity and occurred for 9 doses. Immunizations for two children were delayed because of parent refusal. One parent refused DTP-l on three occasions but later consented. Another parent did not bring in the child for the firs-t well-child visit until 8 months of age because of concerns about vaccine safety in young infants. Discussion The principal cause of delayed immunizations was gaps in clinic attendance. Possible reasons for gaps in attendance include family dysfunction, lack of knowledge about the routine well-child care schedule, lack of awareness about immuni\u00ad zations, and transportation difficulties. Recall or reminder systems are a solution to gaps in clinic attendance. Both mailed remind\u00ad ers,22-24 similar to those used by dentists, and telephone reminders25 are effective. Comparative studies have shown that reminders which specifi\u00ad cally list the individual and vaccine needed are more powerful than those which generally en\u00ad courage up-to-date immunizations but do not list a patient's deficiencies. 26,27 Overly cautious interpretation of contraindi\u00ad cations was an important immunization barrier in this study and in others.9,12,13 Minor illnesses are not valid contraindications according to the National Vaccine Advisory Committee and the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee, but they are important times to administer vac\u00ad cines.16,19,28 User-friendly lists of valid and invalid contraindications are available in the Standards 1ilble 1.

Number of Visits in Which A limitation of this study was our inability as a result of cost constraints to interview parents about gaps in clinic attendance and to interview physicians about immunization bar\u00ad riers. Because our study was con\u00ad ducted in a residency clinic, its generalizability could be limited. We did not include in the analyses 5 chil\u00ad dren who attended the clinic only once and who did not provide im-Immunization Barrier Number of Doses Late Immunization Delayed Mild, acute illness with temperature < 38.3\u00b0C(101\u00b0F) Immunization status not addressed although visited clinic and eligible for immunization Lack of simultaneous vaccine adminis\u00ad tration 33 18 9 for Pediatric Immunization Practices19 and a re\u00ad view article.18 Missed opportunities were important barriers to immunization in this study as in others.12,14 Appointments for acute care visits are important opportunities to address immunization status and to administer vaccines, unless there is a contra\u00ad indication.19 Office staff can routinely evaluate the immunization status of patients prior to the phy\u00ad sician seeing the patient.29-32 This evaluation can be done at the time of registration or by nursing personnel when they obtain temperature, blood pressure, and pulse and respiratory rates. Colored stickers, checklists, computer-generated prompts, or inked rubber stamps are practical approaches to communicate the need for immunization. Lack of simultaneous vaccine administration was only a minor problem in this study, but it has been an important barrier in other studies. 3,15 Simultaneous administration of vaccines is safe and efficaciousH and is encouraged by the Na\u00ad tional Vaccine Advisory Committee.19 Parental refusal to accept immunization was a minor problem in this study. Media reports on alleged reactions to vaccines increased greatly in the late 1980s, leading a number of parents to fear certain immunizations, particularly pertussis vac\u00ad cine. For instance, in Massachusetts, there has been a selective increase in the philosophical ex\u00ad emption from pertussis immunization (although DT has been acceptable).34 Vaccine cost and reimbursement have been major barriers to immunization, but they were not factors in this study because the county pro\u00ad vided free vaccines. Surveys of Texas, Minnesota, and Washington physicians13,35,36 found that many made referrals to public clinics because 48 23 9 munization histories; if these children were included, the immunization rates might be lower. We found three important immunization bar\u00ad riers in a family practice residency clinic: gaps in clinic attendance, overly cautious interpretation of vaccine contraindications, and missed im\u00ad munization opportunities. A concerted effort by all segments of the health care system is needed to avoid needless outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.
