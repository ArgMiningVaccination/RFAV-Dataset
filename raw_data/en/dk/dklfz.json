Much of the initial funding and planning for the University was under\u00ad taken by Ira Allen who is honored as UVM's founder. The University of Vermont was the first college or university in the country to have it plainly declared in its charter that the \"rules, regulations, and by-laws shall not tend to give prefer\u00ad ence to any religious sect or denomination whatsoever\" \u2014 a clear assertion of Vermont's commitment to equality and enlightment. Nine more years passed before, in 1800, the University was finally set in motion with a president-professor and a handful of students. UVM was founded in a day when U.S. colleges and universities existed primarily to educate men for the professions, expeciaily for the ministry. Yet, in studying University history, Professor Emeritus Betty Bandel discovered that \"this small institution located in a frontier community of New England became a pioneer in the kind of practical education which later became the basis for the establishment of the Land Grant universities \u2014 those institutions which made it possible for the sons and daughters of average citizens to aspire to a college education.\" For example, she noted that the University is believed to be the first non-military institution to have offered engineering courses. The University pioneered in yet another area of society, that of giving women equal status with men in higher education. In 1871, the University defied custom and admitted two women as students and four years later was the first institution in the country to admit women to full membership in the scholarly society, Phi Beta Kappa. Tucked in the northwest corner of the Ira Allen Chapel grounds is a memorial to a late nineteenth century graduate of this University, philosopher John Dewey, whose ideas about practical education are still debated with passionate vigor. The first building was subscribed by citizens of Burlington and when fire destroyed that edifice in 1824, its successor, for which General Lafayette laid the cornerstone, was again made possible by the citizens of Burlington. That building, the Old Mill, was only the first in a long line to be made possible by private philanthropy. The list includes all but one of the build\u00ad ings on University Row: Ira Allen Chapel, Billings, Williams, Old Mill, and the Royall Tyler Theatre. Morrill Hall, the first UVM building to be provided by State funding, did not come until 1907. Nearly all state universities function as departments of govern\u00ad ment, and the faculty and staff are state employees. In Ver\u00ad mont, the University is an \"instrumentality\" of the State and its Board of Trustees balances both the public and private sectors. The Board is composed of 25 members: nine self-perpetuating, nine elected by the State Legislature, three appointed by the Governor, and two members of the student body. The Presi\u00ad dent of the University and the Governor of the State serve as ex officio members of the Board. From the beginning, the University has relied on both public and private funding. Today, the University's appropriation from the State of Vermont is about 16 percent of the total operating budget of $155 million. The largest single share (about 31 percent) is obtained from student tuition. Grants and contracts account for about 20 percent of the budget and the re\u00ad mainder comes from alumni and other private philanthropy, endowment, sales, services, and auxiliary enterprises. During 1985-86, 7,882 students were enrolled in the eight undergraduate colleges and schools \u2014 the Colleges of Agricul\u00adture and Life Sciences, Arts and Sciences, Education and Social Services, and Engineering and Mathematics, and the Schools of Allied Health Sciences, Business Administration, Natural Resources, and Nursing \u2014 and 1,064 were enrolled in the Graduate College and 357 in the College of Medicine. The campus of the University of Vermont is located in Burling\u00ad ton, the State's largest city. Within a greater Burlington area of 100,000 people, the city with its population of 38,000 enjoys magnificent views of Lake Champlain and the Adirondack Mountains to the west and Vermont's Green Mountains to the east. Burlington is located approximately 200 miles northwest of Boston, 300 miles north of New York City, and 100 miles south of Montreal. THE UNIVERSITY MISSION Combining the heritage of a private university with that of a land-grant institution, the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College embraces a broad range of instructional and research programs in the liberal disciplines and in the pro\u00ad fessions, and, as well, focuses a significant portion of its resources on serving the practical concerns of the citizens of the state. The blend of these characteristics is reflected in the student body, drawn from Vermont and throughout the nation. The University is at once a local and a national resource and, because of its moderate size, is accurately characterized as a comprehensive university with the teaching environment of a college. The University of Vermont is dedicated to the advancement, transmission, and application of knowledge through teaching, research and scholarly pursuits, and public service. Its faculty and students participate in enhancing the understanding of self and of environment. Exposed to the range of human achieve\u00ad ment, stimulated by a spirit of inquiry and intellectual rigor, faculty and students are enabled to develop and extend their knowledge. The curricula of the undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs provide a balance between response to changing societal needs and the preservation and enhancement of the foundations of liberal education. The University offers a rich environment for research, scholarship, and creative work in many realms of human inquiry, sharing the excitement and fruits of investigation and creation with students and society. Through a variety of research, extension, continuing educa\u00ad tion, and other programs, the University provides assistance, in its special partnership with the state, in the solution of human, social, technological, environmental, and educational problems of the citizens of Vermont. Supporting the mission of the University are the services and academic programs described in this catalogue and, in addi\u00ad tion, the following: THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES In the Bailey/Howe Library, the main unit of the University libraries, are located the services and collections relating to the humanities, social sciences, and many of the sciences. This library holds the largest book and map collection in Vermont, and maintains a representative collection of major periodicals, scholarly journals, indexes, and abstracting services. It is a depository for United States and Canadian government publi\u00ad cations. The Special Collections Department includes the Wilbur Collection of Vermontiana, rare books, literary and his\u00ad torical manuscripts, and the papers of many individuals associated with the state and the federal government. A separate Physics and Chemistry Library is located in the Cook Physical Science Building. Collections in medicine and the 4 | INTRODUCTION health sciences are located in the Dana Medical Library. The University Archives in the Waterman Building contain the per\u00ad manent, offical records of the University. THE GRADUATE COLLEGE The mission of the Graduate College is to serve the needs of college graduates who desire a broader and more thorough knowledge of scholarship and research in their chosen fields. The College offers 57 programs leading to the Master's degree and 16 programs leading to the doctoral degree. For detailed information regarding graduate programs, degree require\u00ad ments, and Graduate College regulations and procedures, refer to the Graduate College Catalogue, available from the Graduate Admissions Office, 332 Waterman Building. Persons applying to and enrolled in graduate programs are ex\u00ad pected to be familiar with the general regulations of the Gradu\u00ad ate College and with the specific degree requirements in their chosen fields of study. Questions pertaining to matters other than admission to graduate programs may be directed to the Graduate College Dean's Office, 335 Waterman. THE ROBERT HULL FLEMING MUSEUM The Fleming Museum houses an important collection of more than 15,000 works: paintings, sculpture, graphics, costumes, and decorative arts representing the full range of world cultures. Highlights include paintings by such American and French masters as Winslow Homer and Jean Baptiste Camille Corot; 19th- and 20th-century American and European prints; American decorative arts and costumes; and outstanding eth\u00ad nographic collections from the Native Americas and Africa. Last fall marked the opening of the Gallery of 18th and 19th Century Art \u2014 the first of the Museum's permanent galleries to be reinstalled following renovation of the building. Opening this fall is the permanent Gallery of European and Ancient Art, including the return of the famed Fleming \"mummy.\" Among the changing exhibitions scheduled throughout this school year are: a UVM Faculty and Alumni Show; SW Indian Pottery; Precisionist paintings by such artists as Georgia O'Keefe and Louis Lozowick; paintings, drawings, and sculp\u00ad tures by the talented couple William and Marguerite Zorach, who worked in various media during the 1920s and 1930s; and a Contemporary Artist show during summer 1987. Lecture series, free to UVM faculty and students, are held in the fall and spring at noon on alternating Thursdays. Special events in\u00ad cluding Community Day, film programs, performing arts, gallery talks, and opening receptions, are held in conjunction with the exhibitions. Recognizing the importance of the Museum's connection with the University's academic programs, the Fleming provides ac\u00ad cess to the use of the collections and exhibitions for study and research. The Wilbur Room, which contains several thousand art volumes, operates as a non-circulation reference library open to the University and to the public on Wednesday after\u00ad noons and by appointment with the Museum Educator. Under\u00ad graduate students have interned at the Museum in art, history, and English. Graduate students have curated exhibitions and have received academic credits for developing and conducting a series of art classes for children. Work study students have opportunities in areas of art education, public relations, marketing, security, and exhibition design and construction. Stocked with books, posters, and items related to the exhibi\u00ad tions, the Museum Shop is an inviting resource at gift-giving time. The Fleming has more than 600 members, with a student membership category available. VERMONT ETV Vermont ETV is the public television network owned and operated by the University of Vermont, serving the state. With studios and offices on the Fort Ethan Allen campus, the network provides an instructional service to schools, college courses for credit, programs for children out-of-school, and a broad spectrum of Eastern Education Network and Public Broadcasting Service programs. Locally produced programs ad\u00ad dress the concerns and issues of Vermonters. Programs are broadcast over WETK-TV, channel 33, Burling\u00ad ton; channel 20, channel 28, Rutland; WVTA, channel 41, Windsor; and on channels 74, 76, 79 at Manchester, Wilmington, and Bennington. UNIVERSITY EXTENSION SERVICE Extension Service agents in every Vermont county simplify and quickly spread the knowledge of UVM's resources and research directly to Vermonters so latest findings can be put to work. This \"grassroots\" approach which reaches nearly all Vermont residents has triggered rapid advances in agriculture, commu\u00ad nity and natural resources, youth development, and home economics. MORGAN HORSE FARM The Morgan Horse Farm in Weybridge, Vermont, has been a shrine for Morgan horse lovers for more than a century. The Morgan breed dates back to 1789 when the first small but powerful stallion was born to a mare owned by school teacher Justin Morgan. The Morgan Farm was established in 1878 by Joseph Battell of Middlebury who compiled the first volume of the Morgan Horse Registry and constructed the farm landmark, an ornate Victorian barn with mansard roof. In 1907, Battell deeded the farm to the U.S. Government, which in 1951 turned the farm over to the University of Vermont. The farm has become a laboratory for UVM students and the focal point for Morgan Horse lovers around the world. The farm continues to host thousands of visitors annually. A versatile, highly intelligent horse, the Morgan is Vermont's State Animal. The breeding program at the Morgan Farm has produced numerous blue ribbon winners at the National Mor\u00ad gan Horse Show.

ADMISSION TO THE UNIVERSITY | 9 NEW ENGLAND REGIONAL STUDENT PROGRAM The University of Vermont is currently an active participant with the Universities of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, and with Lowell Universi\u00ad ty, Southeastern Massachusetts University, and the public four- year and two-year colleges and technical institutes in a pro\u00ad gram of regional cooperation aimed at increasing educational opportunities for qualified young men and women of the New England states. Under the program, New England residents are given tuition privileges in certain specialized curricula which are not offered by public institutions in their home state. New England students enrolled in regional student programs at the University of Vermont who are not residents of Vermont are charged 125 percent of the University's in-state tuition. A brochure detailing these specialized curricula has been pre\u00ad pared by the New England Board of Higher Education and is available through the Board, 45 Temple Place, Boston, Massa- schusetts 02111, (617) 357-9620. Under the New England Regional Student Program, the Uni\u00ad versity of Vermont offers the following undergraduate pro\u00ad grams for the 1986-87 academic year: REGIONAL PROGRAMS Offered By The University of Vermont To Students From Canadian Studies CT, MA, NH, RI Dairy Technology ME, MA, NH, RI Dietetics NH Greek CT, ME, RI Latin RI Russian ME, NH Russian/Eastern European Studies ME, NH, RI INTERVIEWS AND VISITS Students are encouraged to visit the campus to form their own first-hand impressions of the University. Prospective students may schedule an appointment with a current UVM student or a staff member on most weekdays in order to gain information about the academic and non-academic aspects of undergradu\u00ad ate life. Plans should be made as early as possible since inter\u00ad view appointments may be filled quickly. An overnight visit with a student can usually be arranged dur\u00ad ing the academic year. Overnight visits are scheduled Monday through Thursday so that the prospective student may attend class the next day. At least two weeks' notice is normally required so that student hosts may make appropriate prepara\u00ad tions. On many Saturday mornings while the University is in session, group information sessions will be held on campus for inter\u00ad ested students and parents. Students should write or call the Admissions Office, (802) 656-3370, for additional information about the group meetings, overnight visits, or individual ap\u00ad pointments. FOREIGN/INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS APPLICATION PROCEDURES The University of Vermont welcomes qualified applicants from other countries. Interna\u00ad tional students interested in applying to UVM should write to the Admissions Office and request a pre-appiication form. Upon receipt of this completed form, the Admissions Office will send the student a formal application form. International students applying for admission will be required to submit transcripts of all college preparatory education, together with official, certified translations if the transcripts are not in English. These translated credentials must be certified by an of\u00ad ficer of the educational institution issuing the document or by a United States or local government official. Once official documents are received, they become the property of the University of Vermont and will not be returned to the student. In addition to the required SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) or ACT (American College Testing) scores and other supporting documents, students whose native tongue is not English are also required to submit scores from the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language). Admissions deadlines for international applicants are November 1 (for January admission) and February 1 (for September admission). At the present time, no financial aid is available from the University of Vermont to non-immigrant international students. Therefore, students without adequate financial support from other sources should not submit a request for application forms. All international students attending UVM on non-immigrant student visas are charged out-of-state tuition rates. If a student is admitted to the University of Vermont, an 1-20 form (Certificate of Eligibility for an F-l visa) will be prepared by the Advisor in the Office of International Students. Before the 1-20 form is mailed, the student will be required to show proof of adequate funding in the form of a bank statement or an official letter from a sponsoring institution or organization. international students interested in graduate studies at the Uni\u00ad versity of Vermont should write directly to the Graduate College Admissions Office, Waterman Building, University of Vermont. FOREIGN STUDENT SERVICES An Advisor to International Students is available full-time to provide counseling and assistance to international students and faculty on personal and academic problems, and on matters relating to immigra\u00ad tion and social and cultural adjustment. In a special pre- orien\u00ad tation prior to the beginning of the fall semester, the Office of International Students provides new international students with an introduction to the University and Burlington commu\u00ad nities. An active campus International Club provides an oppor\u00ad tunity for international students to contribute to campus life and to make American friends outside the classroom. TRANSFERRING TO THE UNIVERSITY The University of Vermont considers a student a transfer appli\u00ad cant for purposes of admission if, after graduation from high school, one or more courses at the post-secondary level are at\u00ad tempted. Students interested in transferring to the University of Vermont must first satisfy all freshman entry requirements as outlined previously, including having official high school tran\u00ad scripts (or General Education Development Certificates) and of\u00ad ficial SAT (or ACT) score reports sent to the Office of Admis\u00ad sions. Also, transfer students are required to provide an official transcript for ail post-secondary school course work attempted. A transfer applicant may not disregard the record of any previ\u00ad ous education. Applications and supporting materials must be received in Ad\u00ad missions by December 1 for mid-year (January) admissions. Students applying for fail admissions into Physical Therapy have a February 1 application completion date. All other stu\u00ad dents applying for fall admission have an April 1 deadline for application completion. A student who transfers to the University of Vermont from another accredited college or university may be granted provi\u00ad sional credit for ail courses satisfactorily completed with a grade of C- or better, providing that the courses are similar in nature and intensity to courses taught at the University of Ver\u00ad mont. There is a two-stage process for transfer credit evalua\u00ad tion. The Office of Transfer Affairs will determine which course work is acceptable to the University of Vermont in general. The list of courses determined acceptable to the University is then sent to the student's college or school. The academic dean of the college/school to which a student has been admitted will determine how courses will fit into a specific degree program 10 I ADMISSION TO THE UNIVERSITY as well as the length of time required for completion of degree requirements. The grade-point average of transfer students is computed only on course work taken at the University of Vermont. Grades from other institutions do not appear on a University of Ver\u00ad mont transcript. All transfer credit is provisional, pending satisfactory comple\u00ad tion of a semester's work at the University. The provisional transfer credits are fully granted if the student is in good stand\u00ad ing at the end of the first semester. STUDENT EXCHANGE: NEW ENGLAND STATE UNIVERSITIES The six New England land-grant universities {Universities of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut) participate in an exchange program to enable students at the sub-degree level to take advantage of a course or combination of courses not available at the home in\u00ad stitution. In order to participate in the program, state university students must: 1. Identify a course or combination of courses which is related to their area of academic interest and which is not available on the home campus. 2. Receive permission from the appropriate university ex\u00ad change authorities at both the sending and receiving insti\u00ad tutions. 3. Meet minimum eligibility requirements which include the following: In general, students must be in good standing and have at least a 2.50 grade-point average; must be degree candidates; and must be at least first semester soph\u00ad omores {application may be made as early as the second semester of the freshman year). There is no upper limit in terms of class standing on participation. Exchanges may not exceed a total period of two academic semesters, but these need not be taken consecutively. Summer sessions are not considered part of the exchange program. Course work approved by the student's host institution and completed satisfactorily is fully transferable to the home insti\u00ad tution. Transferability of grades and inclusion in grade-point averages are subject to home institutional policy. The student will pay normal tuition and required fees to the home institution and room and board {where applicable) to the host institution. Students on financial aid must contact their home institution's financial aid office to determine eligibility for continued scholarship assistance. Participation in the exchange program will not affect a stu\u00ad dent's residence status either at the home or host institution, nor does participation improve or prejudice possibilities for transfer. For information, contact the Office of Academic Affairs, 349 Waterman Building, University of Vermont. UNIVERSITY RESIDENCY REGULATIONS The Vermont Legislature has established a lower rate of tuition for students who are Vermont residents. Such a policy has as its objective the attempt to more evenly distribute the cost of oper\u00ad ating and supporting the University of Vermont between Ver\u00ad mont residents whose taxes have previously supported the University and non-residents who have not done so. The Legislature has stated that enrollment at an institution for higher learning or presence within the state for purposes of at\u00ad tending an institution of higher learning shall not constitute residence for tuition purposes. IN-STATE STATUS REGULATIONS (Adopted by the Board of Trustees, December 14, 1974; amended June 13, 1981) The following requirements must be met by a student prior to being granted resident status for the purpose of admission, tui\u00ad tion, and other University charges: 1. The applicant shall be domiciled in Vermont, said domicile to be continuous for one year prior to the commencement of the semester next following the date of application. Changes in residency status shall become effective for the semester following the date of application. There shall be one date designated each year for the commencement of each semester and the summer term. A semester shall commence on the day classes begin for that semester. The summer term shall commence on the day classes begin for the summer term. 2. Domicile shall mean a person's true, fixed and permanent home, to which he/she intends to return when absent. A residence established for the purpose of attending an edu\u00ad cational institution or qualifying for resident status for tui\u00ad tion purposes shall not of itself constitute domicile. Domi\u00ad cile shall not be determined by the applicant's marital status. 3. The applicant must demonstrate such attachment to the community as would be typical of a permanent resident of his/her age and education. 4. Receipt of financial support from the applicant's family will create a rebuttable presumption that the applicant's domi\u00ad cile is with his/her family. A student who is the child of divorced parents, where the non-custodial parent or joint custodial parent has been domiciled in Vermont for 12 con\u00adADMISSION TO THE UNIVERSITY | 11 secutive months immediately prior to application and such a parent has contributed in excess of 50 percent of said child's support during at least that period, may be granted In-State Status. Certified copies of such parents' IRS returns may be required. 5. An applicant becoming a student at an institution of higher learning in Vermont within one year of first moving to the state shall have created a rebuttable presumption of resi\u00ad dence in Vermont for the purpose of attending an educa\u00ad tional institution. 6. Eligibility to enroll as a resident student in another state shall create a rebuttable presumption against eligibility to be enrolled at the University of Vermont as a \"Vermont Resident.\" 7. A student enrolling at the University of Vermont shall be classified by the Residency Officer (designated by the Presi\u00ad dent), as a resident or a non-resident. The decision by the Residency Officer shall be based upon information fur\u00ad nished by the student and other relevant information. The Residency Officer is authorized to require such written doc\u00ad uments, affidavits, verifications, or other evidence as he/she deems necessary. 8. The burden of proof in all cases rests upon the student claiming to be a Vermont resident and shall be met upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence. 9. The decision of the Residency Officer on the classification of a student as a resident or non-resident, may be appealed in writing to the Residency Appellate Officer, whose deci\u00ad sion shall be final. ORIENTATION AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS Following acceptance, students must submit by the appropri\u00ad ate deadline dates an acceptance fee and advance tuition deposit. New students are also required to come to the campus for an orientation program; schedules and dates of these meetings are mailed prior to enrollment. The Orientation Pro\u00ad gram takes place in June and September for the fall semester and in January for the spring term. During the two-day pro\u00ad gram students register for courses, meet informally with faculty and other students, and learn about available student services. Immunization and health forms must be submitted to the Stu\u00ad dent Health Center by August 1 of the year of entry.

FINANCIAL AID Many worthy and deserving students are unable to meet col\u00ad lege expenses and for them the University provides, so far as its resources permit, aid in the form of scholarships, loans, and employment. On the basis of the financial aid application and the financial information accompanying it, applicants will be considered for all aid programs for which they are eligible. Aid is most often awarded in combinations or \"packages\" of the various types of aid. Almost all awards include some loan or work-study for which the student states a preference on the ad\u00ad missions application (if the student is a freshman or transfer student) and on the financial aid application (if the student is a continuing student). ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL AID To be eligible to apply for financial aid, a student must be a U.S. citizen or in the U.S. for other than a temporary purpose wilh intent to become a permanent resident. A student must also be enrolled at least half-time (six credits) in a degree pro\u00ad gram. Audited courses cannot be considered as part of the credits in determining financial aid eligibility. Students who believe they are unable to meet college expenses are urged to apply to the Office of Financial Aid for assistance in the form of grants, loans, and employment. FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION PROCEDURES Incoming freshmen and transfer students who wish to apply for aid may do so by: (1) indicating their intention to apply for financial aid on the University of Vermont Application for Undergraduate Admission form, and (2) submitting the Family Financial Statement (FFS) directly to the American College Testing Program in Iowa City, Iowa, or the Financial Aid Form (FAF) to the College Scholarship Service in Princeton, New Jersey. These forms may be obtained from local high schools or by request to the Office of Financial Aid, 330 Waterman Building, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont 05405. Preference is given to those students who submit their applica\u00ad tions by March 1. Applications submitted after that date will be processed in chronological order, subject to the availability of funds. Continuing upper-class students who wish to apply for aid may do so by submitting the Family Financial Statement (FFS) directly to the American College Testing Program in Iowa City, Iowa or by submitting the financial aid form (FAF) to the Col\u00ad lege Scholarship Service in Princeton, N.J. FFS and FAF forms are available early in the spring semester from the Office of Financial Aid.

Box 2000, Champlain Mill, Winooski, Vermont 05404.) FACTORS FOR DETERMINING FINANCIAL NEED Financial aid funds are limited. Accordingly, all assistance of\u00ad fered by the Office of Financial Aid is based on a calculated determination of financial need which considers the following factors: 1. STUDENT BUDGET, comprised of tuition, required fees, room and board, books, supplies, and moderate personal expenses. 2. EXPECTED PARENTAL SHARE of educational cost as determined by the financial information provided by parents on the financial aid application form (FFS or FAF). 3. STUDENT RESOURCES, usually from earnings, private loans, investments, or savings as provided on the financial aid application form (FFS or FAF). 4. ASSISTANCE RECEIVED FROM OTHER SOURCES, such as private scholarships/grants, state agency awards, etc. IMPACT OF ENROLLMENT STATUS CHANGE For students receiving financial aid, change in student status or credit hour load may result in revision or loss of that financial aid, depending on the regulations of the particular aid pro\u00ad grams involved; and, except when aid program regulations specify otherwise, any such change which reduces the stu\u00ad dent's University charges will usually result in a reduction of the financial aid award. The reduction is prorated among all aid sources making up the award according to the applicable regulations. Such reduction of aid will usually require immedi\u00ad ate repayment of the aid so reduced. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS FOR FINANCIAL AID RECIPIENTS Financial aid recipients must meet the University guidelines in regard to maintaining satisfactory academic progress. Students who do not maintain satisfactory academic progress could lose their eligibility for financial aid. Specific information regarding the above can be obtained from the Office of Financial Aid. 1986-87 IN-STATE AND OUT-OF-STATE EDUCATIONAL COSTS Standard student budgets for the 1986-87 academic year are shown below.

Student Life SERVICES Students go through a period of rapid personal growth while on the college campus. In addition to developing new academic skills, they are challenged to pursue new ideas, evaluate their values systems, change existing attitudes, and investigate new life styles. They explore future career options and learn social and interpersonal skills. The broad focus of the Division of Student Affairs at the Uni\u00ad versity of Vermont is to provide support services to students during this time of intense personal development and intellec\u00ad tual growth, in addition to playing a leadership role in develop\u00ad ing experiences, policies, and programs to provide learning and leadership opportunities for students in concert with the formal instructional mission of the institution. To accomplish this mission, the student life areas are divided into various functional departments and programs. Each of these provides or coordinates support services and educational experiences to meet student needs. The offices of the Dean of Students are located in the Nicholson Building at 41 South Prospect Street. COUNSELING AND TESTING CENTER The Counseling and Testing Center provides information, skills training, and encouragement for more effective living, personal growth, and improving academic capability. Services for simple or complex and severe concerns include individual, personal, social, and career counseling on a voluntary and con\u00ad fidential basis. Groups and workshops are designed to meet student requests in areas such as life planning, career develop\u00ad ment, stress management, confidence building, improving learning effectiveness, weight control, and other topics related to the growth of the whole person. Counselors and psycholo\u00ad gists coordinate closely with Student Health Center staff to assist students in maintaining emotional and physical well- being. The Center also coordinates various national testing programs and provides the opportunity to take, at cost, career interest tests and personality tests in conjunction with individual coun\u00ad seling. The professional staff of psychologists and counselors offers services on a no-fee basis to UVM students carrying five or more credits and on a limited basis to faculty and staff through the Employee Assistance Program. The Center is accredited by the International Association of Counseling Services.

This includes providing assistance with necessary tasks (e.g. readers, interpreters, mobility aides, notetakers); academic, vocational, and personal counseling to encourage optimal in\u00ad dependence and eventual employability; course accommoda\u00ad tion; and a support system and structure where students can begin to effect changes on campus, community, and personal issues. Prospective students with disabilities may contact the Coordi\u00ad nator of Specialized Student Services housed in the Counseling and Testing Center for assistance in making decisions and assessing their needs for future schooling. Incoming students should contact the OSS in planning for housing, classroom, and mobility needs. Please write for brochures describing the services at UVM for students with disabilities. The Counseling and Testing Center is located at 146 South Williams Street; (802) 656-3340; TTY (802) 656-3865 656-2625 (UVM Informa\u00ad tion Office). THE LEARNING COOPERATIVE The Learning Cooperative represents a collaborative effort on the part of academic and student affairs offices to improve the ability of UVM students to benefit fully from their academic ex\u00ad periences. Like most learning skills centers on college cam\u00ad puses, the Learning Cooperative supplements the academic environment by providing developmental instruction in writing, reading, and study skills. In addition, the Cooperative works with students to develop good learning strategies for challenging courses and maintains a Campus-Wide Tutoring program. The staff also helps students solve various administrative prob\u00ad lems, such as locating sources of financial aid or understanding University accounting and course registration procedures. Students need only to be enrolled in classes at UVM to use the services of the Cooperative. Participation begins by contacting the staff at 244 Commons, Living/Learning Center, or by call\u00ad ing (802) 656-4075. The Cooperative is open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday, and 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday. Project STAY Project STAY is a special services program at UVM and one of the offices contributing to the Learning Cooperative. Students selected to participate in STAY receive academic support which is in addition to that available to the student body as a whole. Participation is based on a student's financial need, their status as a first generation college student, or because of a physical or learning disability. In addition to meeting the above criteria, a student must also show need for the program. Because the in\u00ad tent of the program is to provide personal and comprehensive services, only a limited number of students are selected each year. Students interested in STAY should contact the office at the Learning Cooperative (address and phone listed above). CENTER FOR CAREER DEVELOPMENT The Center for Career Development provides all students with comprehensive assistance in exploring and implementing their career goals. There are two major components in this effort. The first step is to develop greater self-awareness. This is done by helping students clarify career objectives taking into account skills, interests, needs, and abilities. The second com\u00ad ponent is occupational awareness. Finally, there is skill devel\u00ad opment for entry into the career areas of interest to the students. Along with providing career counseling, the office has developed an active Cooperative Education Program which en\u00ad ables students to fully integrate their academic and career goals. This program is integrated with the academic units in Agriculture and Life Sciences, Natural Resources, and Engi\u00ad neering, Mathematics, and Business Administration as well as other offices in Student Affairs. Students will also find the infor\u00ad mation contained in the Career Resource Library helpful in de\u00ad veloping their career goals. The Center's library contains litera\u00ad ture on various fields, occupational outlooks, salary surveys which are updated four times per year, government opportun\u00ad ities at all levels, as well as a variety of literature describing current career opportunities in both large and small corpora\u00ad tions in the private sector. The library contains two complete guides to ail graduate programs in the country and a variety of 20 | STUDENT LIFE graduate school catalogues from other universities. This infor\u00ad mation is expanding and being updated continuously. After helping students to develop some tentative direction, the office can also assist in the third phase of this process, which is to implement these goals. The Center has a very active on- campus recruiting program which brings local, regional, and national employer representatives to campus for employment interviews. Part-time and summer employment opportunities are made available to students attempting to offset a portion of their educational expenses or gain experience in a field of their interest. The staff will provide help in developing a solid resume, conducting effective employment interviews, develop\u00ad ing a credential file, all as part of developing an overall effec\u00ad tive employment search program. Students are encouraged to make use of the Center for Career Development early in their educational program. The Center for Career Development is located in E Building, Living/Learning Center, (802) 656-3450. Veteran Affairs As part of the Center for Career Development, this office pro\u00ad vides support, coordination of services, and advising to any veteran or dependent eligible for benefits under Federal Law, Chapters 31, 32, 34, or 35. Students eligible for these benefits should contact the office at least one month prior to registra\u00ad tion each semester. Students wishing to register for benefits should be prepared to present their certificate of eligibility to the Veterans Coordinator. It is important that all veterans and dependents keep in contact with this office for the latest information regarding benefits and requirements. Also, those students involved in the Veterans Program should contact this office in the event of any change in credit load, dependency status, address, or major. Preprofessional Advising The Preprofessional Advising Program provides assistance and support to all students preparing for entry to medical, den\u00ad tal, optometry, podiatry, and osteopathy schools. General counseling, advising, and referral services are available to stu\u00ad dents with academic and non-academic questions and con\u00ad cerns. The Preprofessional Advisor works in coordination with the Pre-Health Advisory Committee in preparing student letters of evaluation, as required by the majority of medical, dental, and health professional schools as part of the application process. Pre-Law Advising is available to assist students in their applica\u00ad tion to law school. Materials for registration for the required preprofessional ex\u00ad aminations and application services are available as well as a resource library containing professional school catalogues. CENTER FOR SERVICE-LEARNING The Vermont Internship Program, offered through the Center for Service-Learning, is an opportunity for students to learn through direct experience in an organization or project related to academic, career, or personal goals. The program includes the year-long University Year for Action, semester-long Service- Learning Internships, and the Field Studies Internships. Intern\u00ad ships may include a stipend, academic credit appropriate to a student's individual plan for graduation, participation in a core seminar or learning contract with faculty, and may be in Ver\u00ad mont, out-of-state, or international settings. Internships should be pre-planned at least in the semester prior to participation. Center for Service-Learning staff provide assistance in locating internship sites and providing work plans, learning contracts, and financial planning. Information interviews are conducted to assist students in organizing a structured internship plan. Coordination and support services for the Vermont Internship Program are provided by the Center for Service-Learning. The Center for Service-Learning also offers volunteer oppor\u00ad tunities and assists the UVM Volunteers in Action Program, a Student Association sponsored organization that coordinates student-run volunteer projects such as Big Brother/Big Sister, Adopt-A-Grandparent, and tutoring programs. The CSL Re\u00ad source Library contains information about community volun\u00ad teer opportunities and national and international work service internships. The Center for Service Learning is located at 41 South Prospect Street, (802) 656-2062. MINORITY STUDENT PROGRAM The mission of the Minority Student Program is to meet the University's commitment to create a diversified academic com\u00ad munity. The purpose is twofold: to encourage and increase the enrollment of minority students at the University and to pro\u00ad vide a support system consisting of both academic and social components for those students who may be in need of such services. Special tutorial services as well as non-academic counseling and advising are provided. Spring Visitation Weekend provides an opportunity for pros\u00ad pective minority students who have been accepted for admis\u00ad sion to live on campus for an extended weekend. Once the stu\u00ad dent decides to attend UVM, a one-month college preparatory program is offered during the summer prior to fall enrollment (Summer Enrichment Program). The \"Cultural Connection\" organization funded by the Student Association involves stu\u00ad dents of the University in encouraging cultural pluralism and promoting cultural awareness on a campus-wide basis. The Director of the Program is the official, non-academic ad\u00ad visor for participating students. Personal, social, academic, and other concerns are handled by Program staff. The offices of the Minority Student Program are located in the Center for Cultural Pluralism and at 41 South Prospect Street, (802) 656-3380. Center for Cultural Pluralism The Center creates, develops, and promotes programs to enhance cultural awareness on campus and within the local community. Student involvement in the planning and facilita\u00ad tion of such programs is a primary goal. Programs range from educational coiloquia and cultural dinners to sponsored campus/community-wide ethnic weeks. Guest speakers, films, and cultural performances help bring campus attention to the Afro-American, Asian-American, Hispanic American, and Native American portions of our past and present day Amer\u00ad ican society. Past programs have included Dith Pran, Mary Berry, the UVM Afro-American Dance Troupe and speakers such as Reverend Ralph Abernathy, Russell Means, Curtis Sliwa, Benjamin Hooks, Dick Gregory, and Shirley Chisholm. The Center not only promotes cultural programs on campus but also serves as a gathering place where members of the academic community can meet and share their cultural heri\u00ad tage through a variety of social, cultural, and educational events. The Center for Cultural Pluralism also provides a place where students can come to relax and study. Typewriters, a copy machine, television, computer facilities, and even a kit\u00ad chen are available for any UVM student to use. By providing special programs to increase cultural awareness and apprecia\u00ad tion on campus and within the community, the Center serves an important mission of being \"a place of sharing.\" The Center for Cultural Pluralism is located in Blundell House, (802) 656-3819. STUDENT HEALTH CENTER The Student Health Center is available to all students (except those in the College of Medicine) for primary and preventive health care. A comprehensive program has been developed to meet the needs of college students and includes medical, gyne\u00ad cological, and orthopedic clinics; physical therapy and sports therapy programs; a wellness promotion program; and labor\u00ad atory services. Most of these services are covered by the health fee (see page 13). Students entering the University are required to furnish the Health Center with a complete medical history which includes immunization dates. A physical exam is not required. Because the College of Medicine is located on campus, the Bur\u00ad lington area has a large and sophisticated medical community of which the Health Center is a part. Students requiring con\u00ad sultations are referred to specialists in the area. When necessary, hospitalization is usually arranged at the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont which is a tertiary level teaching hospital located on the edge of the main campus. The Health Center provides medical excuses by keeping a sick list of students who are hospitalized or who are advised to restrict their activities because of illness or injury. The sick list contains names and dates but no medical information. UVM faculty and staff many call the Health Center for sick list verification. The University also makes available to students an optional health insurance plan which provides hospitalization and some outpatient benefits. It is strongly advised that all students attending the University have adequate hospitalization in\u00ad surance. SPEECH AND HEARING CENTER The E.M. Luse Center for Communication Disorders of the Department of Communication Science and Disorders offers diagnostic and treatment services at very nominal cost to all students of the University for communication disorders such as: hearing loss, selection and use of hearing aids, stuttering, voicing disorders, language disorders, articulation disorders, etc. The Luse Center is located in Allen House, (802) 656-3861. ACTIVITIES Participation in extracurricular activities is a vital part of a student's education at the University. To further this end, the Student Activities Office assists students in developing educa\u00ad tional and cultural programs and in managing the operations of their organizations. In addition, the Division of Student Affairs offers an increasingly comprehensive leadership program that encourages not only individual growth, but organizational development. Student Association, the primary student governing organiza\u00ad tion, assumes responsibility for voicing student concerns and interests in the political activities of the University community. It also recognizes and funds approximately 90 student organ\u00ad izations. They are a varied set, including the student news\u00ad paper, The Vermont Cynic; the yearbook, The Ariel; WRUV, the student-operated radio station; UVM Rescue Squad; and the Student Legal Service; in addition to a host of political, religious, service, program, honorary, and recreational groups. A complete listing of student organizations and religious groups can be found in The Cat's Tale: A Student's Guide to the University of Vermont. The Greek system is an integral part of campus life. Thirteen fraternities and six sororities, representing both national and local organizations, maintain active communities at UVM. Extracurricular life focuses on Billings Student Center, which STUDENT LIFE | 21 houses a number of student organizations and provides space for meetings, lectures, films, and other programs. The Student Activities Office, the Student Association Office, and other student organizations are located in Billings Center. INTER-RESIDENCE ASSOCIATION (IRA) The Inter-Residence Association is a government which repre\u00ad sents the students living in University residence halls. The gov\u00ad ernment, consisting of an executive board, legislative council, and judicial board, provides leadership for residence hall students, representing their interests to other constituencies within the University community. IRA involves itself in all aspects of residence hall life, constantly seeking new ideas and avenues for the manifestation of these ideas to make the resi\u00ad dence halls meet the needs of its residents. HONORARY AND RECOGNITION SOCIETIES Honorary and recognition societies at the University of Ver\u00ad mont to recognize student contributions to the University com\u00ad munity and their leadership in campus life. Local honorary societies include Boulder Society, which acknowledges outstanding senior men; and T.O.W.E.R.R., which acknowledges outstanding senior women. National honorary societies represented on the University cam\u00ad pus are as follows: The Phi Beta Kappa Society established the Vermont Alpha Chapter at the University in 1848, and initiates are chosen primarily on the basis of high scholastic standing with em\u00ad phasis on a broad distribution of liberal studies. A detailed statement of the criteria used is available from the chapter president. The local chapter was the first in Phi Beta Kappa to initiate women into membership. Mortar Board is a national society for senior women and men. Although membership in Mortar Board comes as a high honor for a University of Vermont student in recognition of outstand\u00ad ing service, scholarship, and leadership, it is also a challenge for continued sound and honest scholarship, and for unselfish service in the best interests of the college campus. The Society of the Sigma Xi, established at the University in 1945, initiates those who have proven their ability to do research in one of the sciences, including students who have a high scholastic standing. Other national honorary societies include: Alpha Omega Alpha, medicine; Alpha Zeta, agriculture; Kappa Delta Pi, edu\u00ad cation; Tau Beta Pi, engineering; Omicron Nu, home econom\u00ad ics; Delta Sigma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha, debating; Phi Alpha theta, history; Eta Sigma Phi (Iota Chapter), classical studies; Alpha Kappa Delta, sociology; Sigma Phi Alpha, dental hygiene; Ethan Allen Rifles, outstanding students in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps; Champlain Sabres, a military fraternity; and Phi Eta Sigma (outstanding freshmen). ATHLETICS AND RECREATIONAL SPORTS The University encourages and supports a variety of sports at various participatory levels. All full-time undergraduate stu\u00ad dents are eligible to try out for varsity sports and encouraged to participate in all levels of sports activities. High student interest in athletic activities has placed a great demand on facilities. To help meet this demand, a new dance studio, gymnastics/com- bative sports, and multipurpose building was completed in early 1982. The athletic policies of the University are developed by the Athletic Council, an advisory board to the President of the Uni\u00ad versity, composed of faculty, students, and alumni. Athletic relations are maintained with NCAA, ECAC, and NECAC. ft# Ul \u00ab J* X 73 1 R, * * ( STUDENT LIFE | 23 Opportunities exist in the traditional seasonal sports for ail students who are eligible to compete.

THE GEORGE BISHOP LANE ARTISTS' SERIES \"... The George Bishop Lane Artists' Series should include musi\u00ad cal productions and...other theatrical and artistic productions (and) should be open to the students of the University of Ver- mont and the public generally....\" \u2014from the will of Mrs. George B. Lane (April 27, 1954) Since Mrs. Nellie Lane's generous bequest to the University, the Lane Series has presented well over 800 concert and stage productions, over 100 film programs, and many events pro\u00ad grammed especially for children. More than one million tickets have been purchased for performances that have included the major artists, entertainers, and performances of the time. Each Lane Series season has presented a carefully balanced program of the best in classical music, dance, opera, the theatre, and jazz, rock, and/or folk music. Performances have included such orchestras at the Chicago Symphony under the direction of Sir Georg Solti, and the London Symphony Orches\u00ad tra under Herbert Von Karajan; dance has included such events as a full-length Sleeping Beauty with Dame Margot Fonteyn, the Bejart Ballet du XXieme Siecle, Alvin Ailey, and the Joffrey Ballet.

In 1973, the Lane Series helped found and manage the Vermont Mozart Festival, and in the summer of 1976 helped found Stowe Performing Arts, a festi\u00ad val of outdoor events in Vermont's ski capital. The Lane Series led the way to the establishment of New England Presentors, the membership of which represents virtually all of the per\u00ad forming arts in New England. In 1980, the National Endow\u00ad ment for the Arts, through the Vermont Council on the Arts, awarded to the Lane Series a $100,000 Challenge Grant Memorial for the purpose of enlarging the Series' endowment. During the 1985-86 season, the Lane Series celebrated its 30th Anniversary with gala performances by Rudolf Serkin, Yo-Yo Ma, James Galway, and Itzhak Perlman. The Lane Series serves a wide audience: students, faculty and staff, and the community at large. In 1984, it instituted a policy of making a certain number of tickets for each event available at $5 so that all members of the community could be able to at\u00ad tend the Lane Series' events. The Lane Series is managed by a staff of five and is advised by a 60-member Friends Council. Offices are located at 460 South Prospect Street and the telephone number is (802) 656-4455.

However, transfer students are urged to apply for housing with the Office of Residential Life as soon as they are accepted as a student by returning the wait list card they receive with their acceptance letter. RESIDENCE HALLS A residence hall is more than a place to sleep, store one's belongings, and study. It is a place where students can take ad\u00ad vantage of the various opportunities and experiences sur\u00ad rounding them. A diversity of residence halls and programs are offered. There are freshman halls, upper-class halls, coed halls, single sex halls, an environmental hall, and the Living and Learning Center (additional information on the Living and Learning Center is on page 38.

Unless excused in advance by the dean of the college/school concerned, students who do not preregis\u00ad ter will be considered as dropped and may apply for readmis- sion after one semester. Specific directions are published for each semester. Written approval of the student's dean is required to preregister for more than 18 credit hours. ACADEMIC ADVISING Effective academic advising involves an established rapport be\u00ad tween student and teacher. Accordingly, each new student is assigned to a faculty advisor upon admission to the University. The student remains under the guidance of this advisor until a major has been selected, usually during the sophomore year at which time a departmental advisor will be assigned. Students with questions about academic planning should consult their advisor throughout the year and especially during the preregis- tration period. To change academic advisors, students should contact the dean of their college/school. Each academic unit within the University maintains its own system for advising students. ADVISING RESOURCES In addition to an assigned faculty advisor, there are a variety of other advising resources available to University under\u00ad graduates. The Learning Cooperative: represents a collaborative effort on the part of academic and student affairs offices to improve the ability of students to benefit fully from their academic experi\u00ad ences. The Learning Coop supplements the academic environ\u00ad ment by providing developmental instruction in writing, reading, and study skills, works with students to develop good learning strategies for challenging courses, and maintains a campus-wide tutoring program. Pre-Health Advisor: assists undergraduate students with the ad\u00ad missions requirements for dental and medical school. A library of resource materials is maintained which includes literature on alternative health careers, school catalogues, and premedi- cal education journals. Pre-Law Advising: the UVM Pre-Law Committee assists students by providing meetings and panel discussions regard\u00ad ing career options in law. Advising also includes specific infor\u00ad mation on applying to law schools. A current collection of law school catalogues is maintained for interested students. Pre-Veterinary Advising: is available to discuss plans for grad\u00ad uate school and employment in animal science career areas. A selection of catalogues, pamphlets, and other related literature is maintained. International Students and Scholars Advising: verifies immi\u00ad gration status, interprets immigration laws and immigration forms to foreign students, faculty, and scholars. American stu\u00ad dents planning to study abroad should also make their plans through this office which is located at B161, Living/Learning Center. Minority Student Advising: assists students entering the Univer\u00ad sity who demonstrate that additional support services are need\u00ad ed. Incoming freshman minority students may elect to take part in a \"Summer Enrichment Program\" held on campus for a month (three credits). Center for Career Development: assists students who are ex\u00ad ploring a variety of potential career options early in their aca\u00ad demic careers. A library of career information and school cata\u00ad logues is maintained. Veterans Affairs Advising: advises students of their G.I. Bill benefits in education. Counseling and referral on academic matters are available to veterans. ADD/DROP/WITHDRAWAL 1. Courses may be added or dropped only during the first two weeks of classes. After the first week of classes, the instruc\u00ad tor may refuse to allow the add if certain material may not be made up (e.g. laboratories) and the loss of this work would seriously affect the quality of educational experience gained by the student in the course, in any case, faculty are not required to give make-up exams, papers, or quizzes. 2. No drops will be allowed after the second week except in cases where the student is enrolled by administrative error and has not attended the course. The disposition of such cases is handled entirely by the Registrar's Office. 3. From the end of the second week to the end of the ninth week of classes, students may withdraw from courses. Stu\u00ad dents who wish to withdraw fill out the course withdrawal form, consult with their advisor, and submit the form to the instructor. The instructor records an evaluation of the stu\u00ad dent's work. The evaluation options are shown below: WP: Withdraw passing WF: Withdraw failing The instructor sends one copy to the Registrar to be record\u00ad ed on the permanent academic record. Students give a copy to their dean for information purposes. The instructor also records the withdrawal grade (WP or WF) on the final grade sheet which is sent to the Registrar. 4. Between the end of the ninth week and the last day of classes, students may withdraw from one or more courses only by demonstrating to their college or school studies committee, through a written petitionary process, that they are unable to continue in the course(s) due to circum\u00ad stances beyond their control. Such petition must contain conclusive evidence, properly documented, of the illness or other situation which prevents completion of the course(s). Acceptable reasons do not include dissatisfaction 28 | GENERAL INFORMATION with performance or expected grade, with the course or in\u00ad structor, or desire to change major or program. If the peti\u00ad tion is approved, a grade(s) of \"WP\" or \"WF\" will be assign\u00ad ed by the instructors) and recorded on the student's per\u00ad manent record. If the petition is denied, the instructor(s) will assign a final grade (\"A\"\u2014\"F\") in accordance with the same criteria applied to all other students in the course(s). Students wishing to withdraw for medical reasons must contact their dean. 5. No withdrawals are permitted after the last day of classes. 6. The grade of WP will not enter into the grade-point average. The grade of WF will enter the GPA as an F. 7. The grade of \"W\" no longer is used so it is deleted from the set of available options. PASS/NO PASS PASS/NO PASS course enrollments were approved by the Uni\u00ad versity Senate for implementation in September 1968 to en\u00ad courage students to take elective courses they might otherwise avoid for fear of a low grade, to encourage work for internal rather than external goals, and to stimulate intellectual explor\u00ad ation. The action was taken in two parts: FIRST, that any degree program students, not on academic trial, be permitted to take as many as six courses (three courses for two-year students; or as many courses as they have semes\u00ad ters remaining for future transfer students) during their under\u00ad graduate career on a pass/no pass basis, beginning in the sophomore year (second semester of the first year for two-year students). These courses may not include any required by the student's major department, either for the major or for the degree. Only tree electives (without condition) may be taken as pass/no pass. This option may not be used for electives within the distribution requirements of a college or department. Stu\u00ad dents who have enrolled in ineligible distribution elective courses on a pass/no pass basis prior to September 1, 1974, shall not be penalized. Students must complete all work nor\u00ad mally required in these courses and they will receive full credit toward graduation for passing them. The instructor will NOT be informed of the student's status and the Registrar will record grades of \"Ds\" or higher as PASS and grades of \"F\" as NO PASS. Neither \"P\" nor \"NP\" grades will affect the student's grade-point average. The grade submitted by the instructor will not become available to the student nor to any third party. SECOND, that the following addition was approved by the Faculty Senate in January 1974: Physical education (activity) courses, whether taken to fulfill a requirement or as electives, will be available to students on a pass/no pass basis and shall not be counted as a part of the six standard courses described above. Procedure: 1. A PASS/NO PASS Request Form is obtained from the Registrar's Office and the academic advisor is consulted. 2. The advisor's endorsement that the request conforms to the policy established by the University Senate is obtained. Any question about a course or courses being appropriately elected as pass/no pass for a student will be resolved by the student's college/school dean. 3. The request to be placed on pass/no pass status is submitted to the Registrar's Office during the first week of the semester. Requests to be removed from that status must be filed during the same period. Note: Non-degree students may not take courses on pass/no pass basis. AUDITING COURSES With the approval of the dean and the instructor concerned, a regularly enrolled student carrying a normal program may audit a course. Others who do not wish to receive credit, or who have not met admission requirements, may also register as auditors. Auditors have no claim on the time or service of the instructor and no grade credit is given for the work. Tuition is charged at the applicable rate. Under no circumstances will a change be made after the enrollment period to allow credit for courses audited. The approval of the Director of Continuing Education is necessary for auditing courses in the Evening Division or Sum\u00ad mer Session. GUIDELINES FOR INDEPENDENT STUDIES 1. Independent study is an educational experience (taken for credit) which occurs outside the traditional \"classroom/lab\u00ad oratory\" setting. The project is faculty supervised and tail\u00ad ored to fit the interests of a specific student. 2. Independent study will be under the direct supervision of a faculty member having expertise in the area of investiga\u00ad tion and consequently the project will be done in the de\u00ad partment which is primarily responsible for the field of study in question. 3. Prior to enrollment in independent study, students must obtain the approval of their advisor, faculty sponsor, and the faculty sponsor's department chairperson. 4. Independent study may be taken for variable credit. The amount of credit to be granted should be mutually agreed upon by the student and the faculty sponsor at the time of enrollment. 5. When a project is to cover more than one term, the XC (extended course), rather than incomplete, should be used for the first term of work. 6. All departments in which a student may obtain \"service learning\" or \"field experience\" credit should list this option in their description of courses, ff a department offers the opportunity for both \"Readings and Research\" and \"Field Experience (service learning, internships, etc.),\" these of\u00ad ferings should have different course numbers, titles, and catalogue descriptions. In the rare instance where one can\u00ad not differentiate between these two offerings, they may be listed under the same name. 7. All academic units offering independent study courses will be responsible for administering such work. Specific guide\u00ad lines which define the responsibilities of both faculty and student in terms of administering the independent study project are given in Part 8. Alternative guidelines which in\u00ad corporate the basic points in Part 8 are acceptable. 8. Procedure: a. The success of an independent study project is often related to the amount of advanced planning expended on the project. Consequently, planning for the project should, whenever possible, be initiated in the semester before the course is taken. b. By the end of the add/drop period, students will be required to submit to their faculty sponsor a specific plan which must include, but not be limited to, the following: i.The project title. ii.A statement of justification, indicating why independent study is being selected and the reason for undertaking the project, its importance, and how it relates to other work done by the student. iii.A clear and complete statement of project objectives. iv.A concise statement of the plans and methods to be used in order to accomplish each objective. c. During the first full week of classes the student and the faculty sponsor will meet and prepare a document which includes the following: i.A schedule of dates when the student and faculty member will meet and discuss progress, including a GENERAL INFORMATION | 29 time plan indicating when various parts of the work are projected for completion. ii.A list of those ways in which documentation of work can be shown. iii.A plan for evaluation, which will include the specific work to be submitted for evaluation on the project, and a statement of criteria to be used for evaluation, will also be included. d. It is the responsibility of the faculty supervisor to ensure that all the provisions in numbers 7 and 8 above have been satisfactorily accomplished. Copies of alt documents and schedules mentioned in 8.b and 8.c must be filed with the department chairperson by the end of the add/drop period. Completed projects, along with faculty evaluations, should be retained in the fac\u00ad ulty member's files, to be available for review, if neces\u00ad sary, by appropriate school and college committees. REPEATED COURSES Students who repeat a course lose any previous credit on record for that course. The previous grade remains on the per\u00ad manent academic record and is included in computing cumu\u00ad lative grade-point average. CLASS ATTENDANCE Every student is expected to attend all regularly scheduled classes. This is a major responsibility of the student toward himself/herself and toward the University. The primary penal\u00ad ty for non-attendance lies in the student's lessened grasp of the subject matter of the course. It is the responsibility of the stu\u00ad dent to inform the instructor regarding reason for absence from class. Any student who fails to attend a scheduled course by the third instructional day of a semester or the second scheduled class session of a course, whichever comes later, without giving prior notification to the instructor, may be disenroiled. In such cases, the instructor shall notify the Registrar who will remove the student's name from the class list and the course from the student's schedule. Each department is to inform all students in its classes at the beginning of each semester of its policy for handling absences and the penalties that may be imposed. Failure to do any work for which a grade is given, if due to unexcused absence, may result in a failing grade for that partic\u00ad ular work. Tardiness: A student not present at the beginning of an exer\u00ad cise may be marked absent. Right of Appeal: Students who believe that they have been un\u00ad fairly treated in regard to absences may appeal to their academ\u00ad ic dean. Medical Excuses/Sick List: The Student Health Center provides medical excuses by keeping a \"sick list\" of students who are hospitalized or who are advised by the Health Center staff to restrict their activities because of illness or injury. The sick list contains names and dates only, but no diagnosis. Students should inform faculty that they are included on the sick list; this will suffice as a medical excuse from class. The faculty may call the Health Center for verification. FINAL EXAMINATIONS 1. The examination period at the end of each semester is set by the official University calendar. 2. Semester examinations shall be given only during the regular examination period except by permission of the dean of the college/school on request of the chairperson of the department. No examination shall be given during the last week (the last five instructional days) of the semester except lab exams given in courses with specific lab sections. 3. The time and place of each final examination are determined by the Registrar and a schedule is circulated and posted. Any change in the scheduled time or place may be requested by the chairperson of the department concerned when conditions seem to warrant such special arrangement. Decision on such requests rests with the Registrar. 4. In every course in which a final examination is given, every student shall take the examination unless excused by the instructor. 5. Students having a conflict in their final examination schedule must notify the faculty concerned of such con\u00ad flict not later than the close of business one week prior to the last day of classes for the semester in which the con\u00ad flict arises. 6. Students who are absent from a final examination for any reason must report that fact and the reason, in person or in writing, to their instructor within 24 hours. If the absence is due to any situation beyond the reasonable control of the student (e.g. illness or family tragedy), the instructor must provide the student with the opportunity to complete the course requirements. At the instructor's discretion, this may be an examination or some other suitable project. The instructor may require evidence in support of the student's reason for absence. 7. If the absence is not reported as provided above, or is not excused by the instructor, the examination is regarded as failed. 8. No student shall be required to take three or more final examinations in one 24-hour period. 9. Unless a mutually agreeable alternative time can be reached by the student and the instructor, the scheduled make-up will occur the next day after the regularly sched\u00ad uled examination. These considerations are subject to the following constraints: all exams will be given in the final exam period and all conflicts must be resolved before the start of the final exam period. 10. Students will select which of the three examinations they wish to take at an alternative lime. In cases where the in\u00ad structors in all three sections feel it is impossible to give the examination at an alternative time, and all conflicts are in the same college or academic unit, the appropriate dean's office, in consultation with the faculty involved, will establish which of the three examinations will be taken as a make-up. If the unresolved conflict involves more than one college, the deans of the units in question will resolve the matter. If agreement cannot be reached by the deans involved, then a person from the academic vice president's office will establish which of the three ex\u00ad aminations will be taken as a make-up. 11. All final examination materials should be retained for at least one month after the final examination session in case any questions arise concerning grades and to afford students the opportunity to review their graded final ex\u00ad amination papers if they wish to do so. GRADES Grades are reported and recorded as letter grades. Averages are calculated from quality point equivalents. A+ Excellent 4.00 points per semester hour A Excellent 4.00 points per semester hour A- Excellent 3.67 points per semester hour B + Good 3,33 points per semester hour B Good 3.00 points per semester hour B- Good 2.67 points per semester hour C+ Fair 2.33 points per semester hour C Fair 2.00 points per semester hour 30 | GENERAL INFORMATION C- Fair 1.67 points per semester hour D+ Poor 1.33 points per semester hour D Poor 1.00 points per semester hour D- Poor 0.67 points per semester hour F Failure 0.00 points per semester hour This system will start with grades received for courses initiated in the fall semester 1983. Grades received prior to the fall 1983 semester with \" + \" or will receive only those quality points shown on page 42 of the 1982-83 catalogue. Other grades are: AU Audit. Inc. Incomplete. This grade applies to course work which is not completed due to circumstances beyond the student's control, e.g. illness, as documented by the Student Health Center; personal tragedy; academic, such as breakdown of computer or laboratory equipment, or unanticipated delay in receiving information from sources inside or out\u00ad side the University. Incompletes can be awarded only with the permission of the student's college/school dean. The incomplete course requirement will be satisfied at the earliest possible date. In no case shall this time be set longer than the beginning of the corresponding semester of the next academic year. In cases of laboratory assign\u00ad ments, the student must complete all work the first time that the laboratory experience is offered again. It will be the responsibility of each dean's office to determine through the Registrar whether any incompletes have been awarded without prior approval. It is the student's responsibility to learn from the dean's office whether the request has been approved, the date of completion, and, from the instructor, the nature of all outstanding re\u00ad quirements. Procedure: 1. Medical. Students contact the appropriate dean's office to determine type of academic relief needed (i.e. incomplete, withdrawal). Students complete a Medical Action Request and submit it to the Student Health Center. Students and faculty will receive con\u00ad firmation of eligibility for medical action from the dean's office. 2. Personal tragedy. Students contact the appropriate dean's office to discuss these matters. Confirmation of eligibility for incompletes will be provided to faculty by the dean. 3. Academic. Students contact the course instructor to request an incomplete grade. It is the instructor's responsibility to confirm to the dean eligibility for in\u00ad completes on academic grounds. In all cases, the instructor will fill out and forward to the student's academic dean an incomplete card which will describe the reason for the incomplete and will note the completion date to which the student and instructor have agreed. XC Extended Course. This grade is awarded at the end of the semester to a student who is enrolled in an identified course, the nature of which makes it unreasonable or im\u00ad possible for the student to complete the required work within the regular semester. NP Not Passed, not used in grade-point average computation. P Passed, not used in grade-point average computation. WP Withdrawn, passing, not used in grade-point average computation. WF Withdrawn, failing. This grade is weighted as an \"F\" in the computation of the grade-point average. M Missing. Grade not turned in by the instructor. In cases in which a student requests reconsideration of a grade for a course already taken, the grade change, if any, must be made by the instructor and approved by the student's dean by the end of the first month of the following semester unless an extension is granted by the student's dean. TRANSFER OF CREDIT Students seeking to transfer academic credit from all institu\u00ad tions, national and international, may do so only for courses which are comparable in content, nature, and intensity to courses taught at the University of Vermont and are graded at the level of C- or higher. Specific questions regarding credit transfer should be directed to the Office of Transfer Affairs, 330 Waterman. CLASS STANDING The designation of a student's class shall be determined by the number of credits completed. The divisions are as follows: Bachelor's degree: Credit Hours Freshman 0-29.9 Sophomore 30.0-59.9 90.0 and over Associate degree: Freshman 0-29.9 Senior 30.0 and over HOUR TESTS 1. One or more hour tests are usually given during a semester in each course. These are scheduled by the fac\u00ad ulty member within the class periods assigned for the class. 2. In a course which has several sections meeting at different hours, a common test for all sections may be given only by arrangement with the Registrar. A schedule of such tests is made up at the beginning of the semester. Requests should be filed as early as possible. 3. Attendance at hour tests scheduled outside the normal meeting time of the class shall not have precedence over attendance at other scheduled activities or other impor\u00ad tant commitments of the students concerned. Faculty members must be prepared to give a make-up test for those unable to be present at the time set. 4. University academic responsibilities have priority over other campus events. Attendance at (1) regularly sched\u00ad uled classes have priority over specially scheduled com\u00ad mon hour examinations, (2) common hour examinations have priority over attendance at other activities. TRANSCRIPTS An official transcript is the reproduction of a complete, un\u00ad abridged permanent academic record validated with the Uni\u00ad versity seal, facsimile signature of the Registrar, and date of issue. A Key to Transcript is included which contains a full statement of pertinent definitions. A rank-in-class entry is made upon completion of degree requirements. Currently enrolled as well as former undergraduate and grad\u00ad uate students may obtain an official transcript of their perma\u00ad nent academic record by writing the Office of the Registrar, 360 Waterman Building. Please allow a minimum of one week for normal processing and three weeks following the end of a semester. Transcripts are not released when there is an indebtedness to the University. ACCESS TO RECORDS Students have the right to review any of their educational GENERAL INFORMATION | 31 records maintained by the University. Students also have the right to have all educational records maintained in a confiden\u00ad tial manner. In appropriate situations, students may choose to waive some or all of these protections, but such waivers must be clearly stated in writing. If a student feels an educational record to be misleading, or containing information which is in\u00ad accurate, a hearing may be scheduled to seek appropriate modification. Requests for review of records should be made to the Registrar. NAME AND ADDRESS EXCLUSION The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 grants to all University students the right not to have personal infor\u00ad mation contained in the records of the University released to any individual, agency, or organization. UVM feels that the name, address, and telephone number of a student is such per\u00ad sonal information and therefore will not release such address to persons requesting it if a student requests it not be released. Often parents, friends, or fellow students call the University to find out the address or telephone number of such a student. Such information has in the past been generally available in the Student Directory. However, in the future the University will not release such ..information if requested. Students who do not wish to have name, address, and telephone number releas\u00ad ed should fill out a directory exclusion card at the Registrar's Office. UNIVERSITY HONORS The Bachelor's and Associate's degrees may be conferred with honors, by vote of the Senate, in recognition of general high standing in scholarship. Three grades are distinguished and in\u00ad dicated by inscribing on the diploma the words cum taude, magna cum taude, or summa cum taude. Honors are determined in the following manner: Within the graduating class of each college or school, students in the top one percent will receive summa cum taude; the following three percent will receive magna cum taude; the next six per\u00ad cent will receive cum taude. The total number of honors awarded will not exceed ten percent of the graduating class of each school or college. Honors will be calculated on all grades received at this Univer\u00ad sity. In order to be eligible for consideration, a student must have taken at least 60 hours (30 hours for two- year programs) at this university in which a letter grade of A, B, C, D, or F has been awarded. DEAN'S LIST The deans of the undergraduate colleges/schools publish at the beginning of each semester the names of those full-time students with a grade-point average of not less than 3.0 who stood in the top 20 percent of each class of their college/ school during the preceding semester. Full-time enrollment in this case shall be a minimum of 12 credit hours in courses in which grades of A,B,C,D, or F have been given. STUDENT LEAVE OF ABSENCE POLICY A leave of absence means that a student who is eligible for con\u00ad tinued enrollment ceases to be enrolled while in good standing and is guaranteed readmission. This policy benefits both the student and the University in that it enables a student to plan for readmission to the University and allows the University, by having records on the expected date of return of its students, to refine further the planning of the size of the student body. The following statements further define a leave of absence: 1. Upon application to the academic dean a student may be granted a leave of absence by that dean when that appli\u00ad cation merits the commitment of the University to insure the student's readmission. 2. A leave must be granted for a finite period of time. 3. A leave normally may not exceed four semesters. 4. A leave normally may not be granted for the current semester after the day on which courses can be dropped without penalty. 5. A leave may not be granted to students currently on academic trial or disciplinary probation. 6. A leave is distinct from withdrawing for medical reasons and is not granted for medical reasons. 7. A leave does not guarantee housing upon the student's return. 8. A leave guarantees readmission to the student's college/school in the University if the student confirms intent to return by the closing date for a normal readmis\u00ad sion application (October 31 and March 31 preceding the appropriate semester). 9. While on a leave, an individual's student status is temporarily terminated. A leave of absence guarantees an individual's readmission only if the appropriate action is taken. 10. Financial aid awarded but not used prior to a leave will not be carried over. Reapplication for aid for the readmis\u00ad sion period must be made according to normal Office of Financial Aid policies and procedures applicable to that period. 11. A leave should be confirmed by the appropriate form signed by both the student and the dean of the college/ school involved. WITHDRAWAL Students who wish to withdraw from the University must first notify their academic dean in person or in writing. READMISSION Any degree students who have left the University for one semester or more must write to their dean's office to request readmission. Students must apply for readmission by October 31 or March 31 preceding the appropriate semester of return. LOW SCHOLARSHIP The information below describes the general University regula\u00ad tions for low scholarship standing. The Studies Committee of each college/school may determine additional or supplemen\u00ad tary requirements. Students with questions regarding their aca\u00ad demic standing should consult with their college/school dean. 1. \"On Trial\": a. \"On trial\" is an intermediate status between good standing and dismissal. Students remain enrolled ac\u00ad cording to stated academic conditions of their college/ school. b. A student is placed \"on trial\" by the dean or the designated committee of the college/school concerned. Special academic conditions may be set in each case. Normally the period of \"trial\" status is one semester. c. The circumstances under which a student is placed \"on trial\" are as follows: (1) Students who are readmitted to the University after having been dismissed for low scholarship re-enter \"on trial.\" (2) Generally students are placed \"on trial\" if in any semester they have failed half or more of the hours of their enrollment but have been permitted to con\u00ad tinue in college/school. 32 | GENERAL INFORMATION (3) Students whose records have been consistently below the graduating average or generally unsatis\u00ad factory in any semester may be placed \"on trial\" or continued \"on trial\" even though they do not come within the provisions of Section (2). 2. Separation: a. Students are dismissed from the University if they receive grades below passing in one-half or more of the semester hours of their enrollment in any semester unless they are allowed to continue by action of the designated committee. b. Students who fail to meet the condition of their trial or whose record has been unsatisfactory and consistently below the graduation average may be dismissed for low scholarship even though they do not come within the provision above. c. Students dismissed for low scholarship must address their application for readmission to the college/school taking the action. d. Any students dismissed for academic or disciplinary reasons must receive written approval from their previ\u00ad ous academic dean (or the Dean of Students for discipli\u00ad nary cases) before enrolling in any University course. INTERCOLLEGE TRANSFERS A student who is or has been a member of any college/school of this University may transfer to another college/school of the University only with the consent of the deans of the two col\u00ad leges/schools concerned. In the case of veterans receiving edu\u00ad cational benefits through the Veterans Administration, the change must be brought to the attention of the advisor to veter\u00ad ans in the Center for Career Development where a Change of Program or Place of Training form *22-1995 must be com\u00ad pleted and submitted for approval to the Veterans Adminis\u00ad tration. UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Degrees are conferred on the recommendation of the col\u00ad leges/schools and specific requirements will be found in the sections devoted to the respective colleges/schools. In addition to the course requirements of the curricula, students must also fulfill the general requirements in physical education. To be eligible for graduation, a student must have attained a cumulative average sufficient to meet the minimum require\u00ad ments for the college/school in which the student is officially enrolled. Beginning with the class of 1984, the minimum grade-point average for graduation is 2.00. Grades in courses accepted for transfer credit are excluded in computing this average. Every candidate for a degree is required to have taken 30 of the last 45 semester hours of credit (15 of the last 30 for two- year students) in residence at the University except that those who have completed three years of premedical study in the Univer\u00ad sity are awarded their degrees after successful completion of one year of study in any approved college of medicine. Other exceptions to this rule may be made only upon decision of the dean or the appropriate faculty committee of the college or school in which the student is enrolled. To qualify for a second Bachelor's degree, the candidate must have fulfilled all the re\u00ad quirements for the degree and must have taken a full year of work, usually 30 hours, in addition to that taken to qualify for the first degree. PHYSICAL EDUCATION One year of physical education, normally completed during the freshman or sophomore year, is required of all undergrad\u00aduate students in four-year programs. The two credits earned in activities classes will be included in the total number of hours required for graduation. Students may opt to take activities classes on a pass/no pass basis. (For further details, see the pass/no pass heading under General Information.) Medical ex\u00ad aminations are required of all new students. Those with seri\u00ad ous defects may be given restricted work or may be excused by the Director of the Student Health Center. The physical educa\u00ad tion requirement for students pursuing two-year degree pro\u00ad grams shall be one credit of course work earned in activities in\u00ad struction. Students 25 years of age or older at time of admission are ex\u00ad empt from physical education requirements. All transfer students under the age of 25 will be required to fulfill the physical education requirement. UNIVERSITY RESPONSIBILITY Many courses involve instruction in and the use of various types of power equipment, laboratory apparatus, and special\u00ad ized facilities. The University takes every precaution to provide competent instruction and supervision of such courses. It is ex\u00ad pected that students will cooperate by following instructions and exercising precaution. In case an accident does occur re\u00ad sulting in personal injury, the University can assume no responsibility except for medical care that is provided by the Student Health Center. USE OF ENGLISH Correct English usage is demanded by all departments of the University. Written work of any kind which is unsatisfactory in manuscript form, grammar, punctuation, spellirfg, or effective\u00ad ness of expression may be penalized, regardless of content. Students whose written work falls below the standard of cor\u00ad rect usage may be referred to the English Department for addi\u00ad tional instruction, even though the freshman course in English has been passed. Before they may be admitted to the University, foreign students must offer evidence that they are capable of reading and writing English at the college level. ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE The University expects each student to maintain high stan\u00ad dards of personal conduct and social responsibility at all times both on and off campus. All students, as responsible citizens, are required to observe and to share in the support of Universi\u00ad ty regulations. Any student who fails to uphold these standards is subject to disciplinary action by the University. The disciplinary authority of the University is vested in the President. In such cases as the President considers proper, this authority may be delegated to the several deans and to appro\u00ad priate judicial bodies. The continuance of each student at the University, the receipt of academic credits, graduation, and the conferring of any degree or the granting of any certificate are strictly subject to the disciplinary powers of the University. The University is free to cancel a student's registration at any time on any grounds if it considers such action to be for the welfare of the institution. University policy on the above matters is explained in detail in The Cat's Tale: A Student's- Guide to the University of Vermont. Each student is held responsible for knowledge and obser\u00ad vance of these rules and regulations, including those concern\u00ad ed with academic honesty. GENERAL INFORMATION | 33 UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT FOR GRADUATE CREDIT UVM senior undergraduates may enroll for graduate credit at UVM under the following circumstances: the course must be available for graduate credit; total enrollment including the graduate course must not exceed 12 credit hours in the semes\u00ad ter in which the course is taken; the course must not be com\u00ad puted as part of the Bachelor's degree; permission to seek such graduate credit must be requested of the Graduate Dean in writing by the dean of the undergraduate college or school prior to enrollment. Such graduate credit is limited to six hours and is not available for transfer to another institution as graduate credit. It can be used only at UVM if the course is judged appropriate by the student's advisor for the particular graduate program. CREDIT BY EXAMINATION A degree student who wishes to do so may, under the follow\u00ad ing conditions, receive credit for a course by taking a special examination and paying the special examination fee charge of $35 per credit hour. The examination fee must be paid prior to taking the examination. A request for such an examination must be made in writing at least one month before the date of the examination, and it must be approved by the student's advisor, the chairperson of the department in which the course is given, and the academic dean, in that sequence. The student must neither have audit\u00ad ed, previously received a grade or mark, or have attempted a prior special examination in this course at the University of Vermont or at any other institution of higher education. The student may not take a special examination in a course whose content is presupposed by other courses the student has already taken. In cases of uncertainty, the department chair\u00ad person shall decide whether it is appropriate for the student to take a special examination for credit in a particular course. Upon passing the special examination, as determined by the examiner and the chairperson of the department in which the course is given, the student receives credit, but not a grade, for the course. Credit by examination forms are available in the Office of the Registrar, 360 Waterman Building. COLLEGE-LEVEL EXAMINATION PROGRAM (CLEP) The University grants credit for the five general and 30 specific subject CLEP exams providing the student has not previously attempted a similar course of study at a college level. Scores ac\u00ad ceptable for credit are comparable to attaining a level of accom\u00ad plishment equal to a \"B\" in a graded course situation. Individ\u00ad ual exams may earn a student 3, 6, or 8 semester hours of credit depending on the nature and scope of the material covered. Students interested in pursuing the CLEP option may obtain further information from the Office of Transfer Affairs, 330 Waterman. Credit granted for CLEP Examinations may be applied toward distribution requirements and to the total semester hours specified for a particular degree program when approved by the dean of the college/school in which the student is subse\u00ad quently a candidate for a degree. Information about CLEP and application forms are available at the Counseling and Testing Center, 146 South Williams Street. CREDIT FOR MILITARY SERVICE A veteran who has been accepted into a degree program may, upon presentation of DD Form 214 (Report of Transfer or Dis\u00ad charge), receive military studies credit for this experience in those divisions of the University in which credit for Reserve Of\u00ad ficers' Training Corps courses is allowed. Exemption from the physical education requirement is given for service of more than one year. The University accepts college level credit earned through the Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES) formerly the United States Armed Forces Institute (USAF1). DANTES maintains the educational record of the ser\u00ad vice men and women who have completed Subject Standardiz\u00ad ed Tests, CLEP examinations, and GED Tests. The results of courses taken under the auspices of USAFI (disestablished in 1974) which carry academic credit and which were submitted prior to June 30, 1974, are available at no cost from; DANTES Contractor Representative (transcripts) 2318 South Park Street, Madison, Wisconsin 53713. Results of courses taken after July 1, 1974, are available at a nominal charge from: DANTES Contractor Representatives (CLEP) Edu\u00ad cational Testing Service, P.O. Box 2819, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. The Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experience in the Armed Services is the standard reference work for recognizing learning acquired in military life by attending formal military courses. Evidence of satisfactory completion of formal military courses is needed for evaluation. TYPES OF ENROLLMENT DEGREE STUDENTS \u2014 Students who have presented appro\u00ad priate credentials for admission and have been accepted as students in a degree program. NON-DEGREE STUDENTS \u2014 Students who have presented minimum credentials and are permitted to undertake limited course work (up to six credit hours per semester) for a purpose other than the earning of a degree through Continuing Educa\u00ad tion. Credits earned by non-degree students who later apply and gain admission to a degree program will be evaluated and, if appropriate, will be accepted toward completion of their degree. Non-degree students may enroll for a maximum of six credits (or two courses) per semester in the day program. Special permission is necessary for a student to exceed the six- credit maximum. Before completing 30 credits of course work through Continuing Education, degree- bound students should consult with an advisor at Continuing Education, submit an ap\u00ad plication for formal admission to UVM, and then should con\u00ad sult with the appropriate dean to structure further courses into a degree program. Selection of courses for those having long-range plans of earn\u00ad ing a degree should be made on the basis of information given in this catalogue. Students interested in making a formal appli\u00ad cation for admission to the University should contact the Ad\u00ad missions Office. Students presently enrolled and in good standing at another in\u00ad stitution may take courses at the University of Vermont to transfer to their institutions. Visiting students are considered non-degree students and should contact Continuing Education for information and registration material. All non-degree students who would like assistance in planning educational programs and selecting courses should contact Continuing Education, (802) 656-2085. X U W -A 1 s / N, * r / Academic Options In addition to the areas of study detailed in the following sec\u00ad tions of the catalogue, a number of curricular options are avail\u00ad able which provide unique opportunities for UVM students. The Environmental Program Environmental Studies is a special University-wide under\u00ad graduate curricular option offering students several ex\u00ad citing academic programs. Directed by the Environmental Pro\u00ad gram in cooperation with several colleges and professional schools, this option is one of UVM's most distinctive academic programs \u2014 unique nationally in its breadth and interdiscipli\u00ad nary nature. The Environmental Program involves students and faculty from throughout the campus, as well as community profession\u00ad als, recognizing that study of the environment must draw upon all disciplines and professional fields. The activities of the Pro\u00ad gram include undergraduate education, research, and commu\u00ad nity service programs dedicated to the study of the cultural and natural environments essential to the quality of life on earth. While the Environmental Program attempts to serve a wide range of environmental interests, its primary focus is the indi\u00ad vidual student, A Director and interdisciplinary faculty work closely with each student in planning an individualized pro\u00ad gram of studies which combines a broad, comprehensive understanding of the environment together with depth in a specific discipline or profession. Program offices are located in The Bittersweet, where students are encouraged to visit with the faculty regarding their academ\u00ad ic plans, to gain help with research or action projects, and to seek information about academic programs, internships, and future careers. DEGREE PROGRAMS The Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Studies is awarded through the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, the College of Education and Social Services, and the School of Natural Resources. The Bachelor of Arts degree in Environmental Studies is awarded through the College of Arts and Sciences. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Students must complete the distribution and credit-hour re\u00ad quirements of their college or school and one of the following programs. Incoming students will be assigned an advisor in the Environmental Program who will assist in selecting a major program, usually during the sophomore year. e ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES CURRICULUM The curriculum in Environmental Studies offers students sev\u00ad eral alternatives leading to an individualized program of studies: The Major in Environmental Studies provides a unique academic program for the student seeking an individually-designed interdisciplinary major leading to the B.S. or B.A. degree, with opportunity for Honors Studies. The Coordinate Major in Environmental Studies combines environmental studies with a traditional liberal arts or professional major. The Minor in Environmental Studies fulfills the minor requirement for students in the College of Arts and Sciences. Students entering the University may apply for admission to Environmental Studies through several of the undergraduate divisions. Choice of the appropriate college or school will de\u00ad pend on the individual's interests, educational objectives, and selection of one of the program options noted above, it is rec\u00ad ommended that prospective students consult with the Environ\u00ad mental Program before making application for admission to the University. MAJOR IN ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES This interdiscipli\u00ad nary major offers students the opportunity to combine studies in several disciplines and professional fields. In addition to a core of interdisciplinary courses, each student's program in\u00ad cludes an individually-designed plan of studies directed toward newly-developing careers and graduate study programs, it is especially suited to the student seeking a broad liberal educa\u00ad tion with an environmental emphasis. This individually-designed major is a highly-selective program for qualified students with well-conceived academic goals. Ad\u00ad mission to the major requires submission of an application to the Environmental Program, approval of the Director, and suc\u00ad cessful completion of Environmental Studies 51. In addition to course requirements, this major includes a required senior research thesis, which may qualify for college or school Honors recognition.

The Home Economics Program The Home Economics Program is an interdisciplinary pro\u00ad gram about people. It can provide a unique option for stu\u00ad dents searching for a major or for those who have selected a major. A sequence of courses in family issues may be chosen \u2014 nutrition, consumer management, and family systems, for example. Combined with courses taken for the major, career possibilities can be expanded. Students become attractively different from other graduates which enhances career market\u00ad ability. This arrangement can be formalized by co-enrollment in the Home Economics Program. This means that these courses are taken within the four-year degree requirements. Upon gradua\u00ad tion, students are identified as professional home economists. Whether nutritionist, home economics educator, merchandi\u00ad ser, or human service professional, the courses and academic experiences offered with co-enrollment help build a strong foundation for personal and career success. More can be learned about the Program from the currently co- enrolled students or from the Coordinator. The office of the Coordinator is located on the first floor of Terrill Hall. DEGREE PROGRAMS Co-enrollment is possible with any University major. Students with majors in Human Nutrition and Foods; Merchandising, Consumer Studies, and Design; Home Economics Education; or Human Development Studies, most often select the co- enrollment option. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Specific degree requirements are elected by making choices from the co-enrollment selection of courses about family/indi\u00ad vidual/consumer/client issues and by satisfying departmental requirements. The majors most often selecting co-enrollment are: Dietetics Food and Nutrition (through Human Nutrition and Foods \u2014 see page 46 for details) Home Economics Teacher Education (through Vocational Education and Technology \u2014 see page 49 for details) Consumer Studies Fashion Merchandising Related Arts (through Merchandising, Consumer Studies, and Design \u2014 see page 47 for details) Early Childhood Development Human Development and Family Studies Human Development Education (through Human Development Studies \u2014 see page 69 for details) Students interested in finding out about these options to broaden their educational background and to enhance their career opportunities are invited to contact the Coordinator of the Program.

The Living/Learning Center The goal of the Living/Learning Center is to integrate aca\u00ad demic and cultural activities with residential living in ways that enrich the personal and intellectual lives of its parti\u00ad cipants. It is an academic and student support unit as well as a residence, housing 588 students and several faculty families, as well as faculty and administrative offices, including the Center for Career Development and the Learning Cooperative. The focus of the Living/Learning Center is the group of 20 to 30 programs, each of which is a year-long plan of course work, independent study, seminars, field trips, or other special activi\u00ad ties which support a specific program theme. Programs are designed and directed by students or faculty members and reflect academic or avocational interests of the program leaders and participants. Program organization includes statements of the skills, knowledge, or creative talents the program seeks to develop in its members. Living/Learning Center programs thus supplement the University's commitment to excellence and innovation in curriculum and instruction. The Center pro\u00ad vides a novel environment in which each of the schools and colleges of the University is able to offer particular curricular elements in an atmosphere which fosters broad opportunities for intellectual discourse. The freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, and graduate stu\u00ad dents who reside in the Center live with fellow program mem\u00ad bers in five-, six-, or seven-person suites adjoining a common living room and bathroom facilities. This fosters close friend\u00ad ships and communication among the program members. The suites are located in each of the five buldings as are class\u00ad rooms, laundry rooms, common living rooms and kitchens, as well as apartments for resident faculty and their families. The Center has a reading room/reference library, computer ter\u00ad minal room, several classrooms, grocery store, music practice rooms, dining hall, a pre-school, an audio/visual room, U.S. post office, administrative and faculty office space, a main Center lounge with a fireplace, and an art gallery. In addition, through the efforts and expertise of accomplished staff artists, the Center has pottery and photography studios that provide direct program support for the L/LC community. The Univer\u00ad sity community is invited to become \"co-op\" members of the pottery and photography studios, providing members with informal instruction and use of the facilities and equipment. The building is accessible and equipped for the handicapped. Every program, faculty and student directed, sponsors educa\u00ad tional activities to which the entire UVM community is invited, making Living/Learning a center of cultural and intellectual activity. An evening's activities might include a sign language workshop, conversational Russian, dialogue with UVM faculty, artistic performances and gallery exhibits, or presentation by the mime program. Attracting townspeople through the exciting opportunities for involvement and learning, the Living/Learning Center and its residents benefit from the expert advice of interested Burling- tonians who participate as L/LC Student Program Advisors, workshop leaders, local audiences (theatrical and musical per\u00ad formances), L/LC art gallery devotees, and as guest artists who exhibit or perform their art for the L/LC students and Univer\u00ad sity community. The Living/Learning Center offers the opportunity to be part of a community of people \u2014 students, faculty, and administrative staff \u2014 who share the goal, work, and excitement of together improving the scope and quality of their University experience. Continuing Education Through evening, summer, and non-credit programs, the University provides learning opportunities to persons who have or have not previously attended college, who desire additional knowledge for their careers, or who wish to pursue previously unexplored areas of study.

These four areas of work are performed by the resident instruction division, the research division (Vermont Agricultur\u00ad al Experiment Station), the extension division (Vermont Coop\u00ad erative Extension Service), and the Related Services Division. The curricula of the instructional division prepare students for professional careers in business, management, specialized ser\u00ad vices, sales, education, government service, and research. The evolution of society is characterized by continual progress and change. The challenge of preparing students to excel now, yet adjust to future changes, is met through programs which give a foundation in the social sciences and the humanities as well as providing a fundamental technical education. Certain courses are prescribed in each area of study with an allowance made for the election of additional courses, provid\u00ad ing a well-balanced and integrated educational program and in\u00ad suring reasonable concentration. Faculty advisors counsel stu\u00ad dents in selecting elective courses and solving educational problems. The normal semester program includes 15 to 18 credit hours of courses.

Basically, students in cooperation with a faculty member initiate, plan, and conduct research and prepare a manuscript (or other appropriate report) on their work which is judged by the Honors Committee. Research projects may result from an undergraduate research elective, a special topics course, or as a part of an advanced undergraduate course. No specific grade-point average is required and research may be done within or outside the College. Completed research, in a form appropriate to the research area, will be evaluated by the Honors Committee. Those of high quality will be chosen for College Honors. Students are recog\u00ad nized at College Honors Day and awards are added to the tran\u00ad script. PREPROFESSIONAL PREPARATION Students striving for admission to professional colleges, such as dentistry, medicine, and veterinary medicine, can meet the undergraduate requirements for these programs through en\u00ad rollment in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Those interested in human medical sciences usually enroll in either biochemical science, biological science, human nutrition and foods, or microbiology. Those interested in veterinary medi\u00ad cine usuall enroll in animal sciences, biological sciences, or microbiology. Any student indicating a specific professional in\u00ad terest will be assigned a faculty advisor knowledgeable in that area. Competition for admission to professional schools is very keen and a superior academic record throughout an undergraduate program is necessary to receive consideration for admission. Due to this intense competition, all potential candidates must complete the requirements in an area of secondary interest. Students applying to the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and expressing an interest in medicine or preveteri- nary medicine, should present evidence of high performance in high school level science and math courses, plus addi\u00ad tional supporting documentation such as high SAT scores, strong letters of recommendation, and a motivational sum\u00ad mary statement. BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES CORE Students initially interested in the broad area of biological sciences may enroll in this core curriculum for the freshman and sophomore years. The curriculum is designed to permit students to continue in basic biology or to transfer to one of the applied biology programs. In addition to the general college re\u00ad quirements listed above, students should complete during the first two years the following courses or their equivalents: Biology 1, 2 or Zoology 9 and Botany 4; Math. 19, 20 or Math. 21; Chemistry 3, 42 or Chemistry 1, 2 and 141, 142; Microbiology 55 and Animal Sciences/Human Nutrition and Foods 43 (Nutrition). Course descriptions are listed under the appropriate departments. Preprofessional students should con\u00ad sult their advisor to determine which courses are most appro\u00ad priate. Programs available upon completion of the core curriculum are listed below. Students may wish to select offerings from these programs during the freshman and sophomore years in addition to the required courses stated above.

ANIMAL SCIENCES The Department of Animal Sciences offers two academic pro\u00ad grams, one in Animal Sciences and the other in Dairy Foods. Each program has specialized options. Experienced faculty ad\u00ad visors work with each student to plan a curriculum that will be appropriate for the individual's career goals. Courses will be selected from a current UVM catalogue. A student must suc\u00ad cessfully pass a minimum of eight courses in the Department of Animal Sciences, including at least four of advanced stand\u00ad ing and senior seminar. In the junior/senior years, students who have maintained a good academic record are encouraged to participate in one of the many special problem/research courses. These provide an opportunity to work in basic science research laboratories of the Vermont Experiment Station or to develop applied skills under the direction of a faculty member. Students should in\u00ad vestigate a summer at the W. H. Miner Agricultural Research Institute or work experience through the Cooperative Educa\u00ad tion Program in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Opportunities abound for the unusual, exciting educational ex\u00ad perience. grams are highly individualized depending on the students' needs, there are four options offered in this major program: Dairy Production: The major production option relates to the feeding, breeding, and management of dairy cattle. Supporting courses are also offered in the production of livestock, pleasure horses, and poultry. This option includes practical work exper\u00ad ience opportunities in addition to formal classes in science and business. The graduate is prepared to own or manage a modern dairy farm as well as work in allied industry positions. Many students have an interest in Horse Production. The De\u00ad partment offers three courses in care and management of horses. In addition, the support courses in nutrition, physi\u00ad ology, animal health and disease, genetics, and management relate equally to horses. Students may wish to take more specialized courses at the University of New Hampshire on an exchange program (New England Student Exchange). Animal Agribusiness: An option that emphasizes business and prepares graduates for supervisory and management posi\u00ad tions in industry related to animal sciences. Exciting educa\u00ad tional experiences exist through the Cooperative Education Program. Career opportunities exist in the processing and sales of dairy, meat, and poultry products; feed and fertilizer com\u00ad panies; sales of pharmaceuticals; farm equipment and supply agencies; banking, advertising, and public relations. Students will be urged to seek a double major in Agricultural and Resource Economics, since a heavy concentration of courses in that program will be required. Preprofessional Science: This is the option for students inter\u00ad ested in the basic sciences. Opportunities exist for study in a modern laboratory as part of a research team. Students inter\u00ad ested in veterinary or human medicine, graduate school in nutrition and physiology, academic positions, or research and development in industry all start here. Students will be provid\u00ad ed with a strong basic science background necessary for ad\u00ad vanced study in addition to applied animal agriculture. General Studies in Animal Sciences: An opportunity to indi\u00ad vidualize a program or a place to start for students interested in Animal Sciences but who have no specific career goals at this time. Some students desire double majors in diverse areas which limits the time available in both. This flexible option provides the mechanism for such a program. Other students simply need a \"place to start\" and later transfer to one of our other options. The core courses which all Animal Sciences majors must take are: Agricultural Orientation, Chemistry, Introductory Animal Science, Fundamentals of Nutrition, Biology, Genetics, Physi\u00ad ology, Statistics, Computer Science, Mathematics, and Senior Seminar. Each student must select elective courses to meet col\u00ad lege requirements in communications, social sciences, fine arts and humanities, and physical education. Additional specific courses for each option will be selected with the help of the stu\u00ad dent's academic advisor. Course programs are individualized to meet the needs of each student.

BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE This program is designed for students who want to major in the field of biology. It provides flexibility in developing a back\u00ad ground in biological sciences. Students may fulfill their course requirements by selecting basic and applied courses from the several biologically-oriented departments (Agricultural Bio\u00ad chemistry, Animal Sciences, Botany, Human Nutrition and Foods, Microbiology, Plant and Soil Science, Zoology, and others). Graduates of the program may continue their education in graduate school or professional schools or they may obtain em\u00ad ployment in a variety of areas. Possible job opportunities would include basic and applied research in educational insti\u00ad tutions and governmental agencies, technical writing, employ\u00ad ment with environmental consultants, and sales and merchan\u00ad dising positions requiring a scientific background. The following courses are required of all students in the Bio\u00ad logical Science program following completion of the Biological Sciences Core: genetics (one semester), biochemistry (one sem\u00ad ester), physics (two-semester sequence), and statistics (one semester). In addition, all students must take five additional courses in basic or applied biology. These courses should be selected to include at least one course from the following areas: botany or applied plant science, zoology or applied animal science, evolution and diversity of life, ecology, and physiology or biochemistry. One or more of these courses should be at the 200 level and the others at the 100 level. These courses are selected in consultation with the advisor from the diverse offer\u00ad ings of the various colleges and departments. BIOCHEMICAL SCIENCES The program in Biochemical Science provides a coordinated sequence of study in chemistry, biology, and biochemistry. Contemporary biology increasingly demands knowledge of events at the molecular level. Students who plan a career of research or teaching in biology are well \"advised to concentrate on the principles and methods of biochemistry during their undergraduate years. Depending on the student's future plans and capability, two areas of concentration are possible. Cellular Biochemistry emphasizes the physiological and metabolic reactions of organisms. Molecular Biology focuses on the chemical and physical struc\u00ad tures of subcellular particles. Specialization in either one of these concentrations normally commences in the junior year after completion of the Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences Core (page 42). Students are required to complete three to eight hours of physical chemistry, 12 hours of bio\u00ad chemistry and three advanced biology courses, two of which would be in their concentration (e.g. physiology, genetics, biotechnology, etc.) BOTANY Students in the Colleges of Agriculture and Life Sciences or Arts and Sciences may major in Botany. Each undergraduate plans a program in consultation with a personal department advisor. The emphasis on flexibility permits a choice of elec\u00ad tives when planning for each individual's career. Cross- disciplinary study is encouraged as botany, a fundamental science, is the base upon which education, research, and careers in both applied and basic plant science is built. Many students aim specifically for careers that do not require formal education beyond the Bachelor's degree, e.g. preparation for numerous positions in: agriculture, business, education, ad\u00ad ministration, government, industry, medicine, research, or their own businesses. Many other students prepare themselves for graduate education and professional careers requiring ad\u00ad vanced degrees, e.g. careers in botany, biology, medicine, den\u00ad tistry, agriculture, biochemistry, or environmental sciences. In either case, close attention is given to increasing the student's choices after college. Students are also encouraged in their senior year to enrich their botanical experience through in di- viduaiized, original research and study with faculty members. Areas of interest include: anatomy, cell botany, cytology, ecology, phycoiogy, physiology, plant development, plant pathology, and taxonomy. Required courses: Math. 22; or Math. 21 and Statistics 141 or 211; or Math. 19, 20 and Statistics 141 or 211, Physics 21, 22; and 11, 12 or preferably 31, 42; Chemistry 42 or preferably 141, 142; Biology 1, 2; Botany 101 or 132, 104, 107, 108, and 109 or 160; two additional semester courses in Botany, at least one at the 200 level. Six hours of modern foreign language are strongly recom\u00ad mended. Students may petition the department to substitute other courses for certain requirements in the planning of indi\u00ad vidual programs. ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES The College of Agriculture and Life Sciences participates in the interdisciplinary University Environmental Program as des\u00ad cribed on page 35. Students may elect either the Coordinate Major and fulfill the requirements of one of the major programs in the College or the Major in Environmental Studies. HUMAN NUTRITION AND FOODS The Department of Human Nutrition and Foods prepares students to enter the rapidly growing field of nutrition and/or foods. Such preparation requires a strong foundation in basic science including chemistry, physiology, microbiology, and biochemistry. The Department recognizes the importance of general education and majors are required to complete courses in psychology, sociology, economics, English composition, speech, statistics, and the humanities. The course credits earned in Human Nutrition and Foods pro\u00ad vide background in normal, cellular, and therapeutic nutrition as well as nutrient requirements for growth, development, and health at various stages of the life cycle. Other courses focus upon physical, chemical, and nutritional properties of food, and consumer aspects of food as related to socioeconomic status, lifestyle, cultural beliefs, and state of health. Although a series of courses providing information in these areas is re\u00ad quired of all majors, each student has some choice of electives. Students may major in Dietetics (Plan IV with a general or clin\u00ad ical emphasis approved by the American Dietetic Association) or Human Nutrition and Foods with an option in food science or human nutrition: applied or research. It is possible to meet the requirements for more than one option. Students may choose to meet medical school requirements. Dietetics: This major is designed to meet the Plan IV Academic Requirements with a general or clinical emphasis which is ap\u00ad proved by the American Dietetic Association. For ADA mem\u00ad bership or to become a registered dietitian, the academic requirements and a clinical experience must be completed. This course plan provides a solid background in basic science, normal and therapeutic nutrition, foods, and quantity food management. Career opportunities include hospital dietetics as well as community nutrition programs, quantity food manage\u00ad ment, or graduate school. Human Nutrition and Foods: This major is designed to pro\u00ad vide a strong background in basic science, norma! nutrition, and food with the opportunity to develop an option in food science or human nutrition. Graduates may find career oppor\u00ad tunities with food companies, food management companies, community nutrition programs, government agencies and the Agricultural Extension Service, or graduate school. Home Economics Program: This major is designed to provide students an opportunity to enroll in the Home Economics In\u00ad terdisciplinary Program. Students may broaden their educa\u00ad tional background by combining their area of specialization in Dietetics, Human Nutrition, or Food Science with courses in the Home Economics Program. This is particularly appropriate for nutrition professionals who plan to work with families in community-based settings. MERCHANDISING, CONSUMER STUDIES, AND DESIGN The Department prepares students for careers in business and industry, education, extension, and government, or for pursu\u00ad ing graduate study. Practical as well as theoretical approaches are presented and examined in the three program areas: con\u00ad sumer studies, fashion merchandising, and related art. Al\u00ad though diverse in substance, the areas are joined by their con\u00ad cern and relationship with consumer needs and behaviors. Scientific, artistic, or business approaches to the product areas of the textiles and clothing fields and consumer orientations to other products and services in general can be pursued in this multi-faceted department. Students may co-enroll in the Home Economics Program (see page 36 for complete description) with any of the three pro\u00ad grams. This requires completion of professional course require\u00ad ments as well as home economics core requirements, and two seminars focusing on theoretical and practical implications of the home economics field. All majors take the following courses: Design, Textiles: Fibers to Fabrics, Career Seminar, Introduction to Consumer Pro\u00ad blems, Consumer Management Principles, Consumer Motiva\u00ad tion, and Field Experience. These common courses and a core of general University courses in the social, physical, and quan\u00ad titative sciences, humanities, and communication enable students to build an interdisciplinary base for their major. Career exploration through professional seminars and field ex\u00ad periences enhances the student's awareness of the professions as well as tests the appropriateness of potential careers. Consumer Studies: This major addresses the interaction of economic, social, and political conditions as they affect the consumer. An understanding of the relationship of manage\u00ad ment and motivation to consumer problems, and the impact of public and private sector institutions, forms the basis of a flexi\u00ad ble program of study. Majors select their courses to provide a career orientation in business, public service, or human ser\u00ad vices. Fashion Merchandising: This major combines a knowledge of textiles and apparel with the business and management skills required in retailing. Accounting, marketing, advertising, sta\u00ad tistics, and computer science courses complete the fashion merchandising student's professional preparation. Career pos\u00adTHE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND LIFE SCIENCES | 47 sibilities include retailing, buying, marketing, and promotion of consumer goods, particularly in the apparel or textiles areas. Related Art: This major offers preparation in both apparel and textile design. Students apply the elements and principles of design in weaving, dyeing, and printing fabric and creating ap\u00ad parel by draping and flat pattern techniques. Alternative needs and end uses are evaluated during the design process, utilizing supporting courses in history and the social and physical sciences. Students are prepared for a variety of positions in the textile and apparel industries including design, sales and edu\u00ad cational representatives, apparel and textile production, and management. MICROBIOLOGY The study and application of information obtained in Micro\u00ad biology has considerable importance in health, agriculture, ecology, and industry. Students planning a career focused on any of these areas are well advised to obtain a solid foundation in microbiology and related disciplines. To accomplish this goal, the program in microbiology provides a coordinated se\u00ad quence of study in such foundational sciences as biology, mathematics, chemistry, and biochemistry coupled with a strong preparation in microbiology. This program has the following concentrations: general microbiology, microbial biotechnology, molecular genetics, cell biology, immunology, host-parasite interactions, applied microbiology, and clinical microbiology. Specialization in one of these concentrations commences in the third year, after completion of college distri\u00ad bution and program core requirements. A graduate from this program would be qualified for laboratory positions in indus\u00ad try, for federal, state, and university positions related to control and use of microorganisms, as well as other positions requiring an understanding of contemporary microbiology. Completion of these studies will give the student the background to con\u00ad sider employment in food or agricultural industries, chemical and pharmaceutical companies, companies producing pro\u00ad ducts by recombinant DNA technology, or organizations in\u00ad volved with biomedical research and public health. In addi\u00ad tion, the program through its concentration in Clinical Micro\u00ad biology, used as a Microbiology Specialty Option, can lead to certification by the American Society for Microbiology and thus enable the graduate to work as a microbiologist in hospital en\u00ad vironments. This program will also provide a foundation for graduate work in microbiology, molecular biology, cell biology, and biotechnology. PLANT AND SOIL SCIENCE The Plant and Soil Science program has several specialized op\u00ad tions designed for students interested in horticultural crops, agronomic crops, soils, pest management, and alternative agri\u00ad culture as they relate to the science of food, feed, and fiber pro\u00ad duction or to recreation and the environment. The program is flexible and allows students to place their primary emphasis in either science or agribusiness which prepares students for many employment opportunities, including agribusiness sales and service, agricultural extension, farming, soil and water management, and land use planning. Suggested options have been developed by the Department to be used as guides for stu\u00ad dents interested in careers in general plant and soil science, agronomy, horticulture, soil science, and pest management. Specific courses, in addition to the core courses, are worked out between the student and the advisor. Agronomy: This option concerns the production and manage\u00ad ment of field crops, forage crops, and pastures for food, feed, and fiber as well as turfgrasses for landscaping and reducing soil erosion. Students learn to apply plant and soil principles to the care, improvement, and wise use of soils and land resources. 48 | THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE AND LIFE SCIENCES Alternative Agriculture: This option is oriented toward an agriculture that strives to lessen dependence on inputs from off the farm. Emphasis is on understanding balanced soil-crop- animal ecological systems. Students gain training and experi\u00ad ence needed for working in agriculture in ways that minimize environmental pollution and decrease dependence on non\u00ad renewable resources. Horticulture: This option studies the varied field production, use, and marketing of fruits and vegetables for food produc\u00ad tion, and flowers, shrubs, and trees for ornamental use. Plants, the man-made environment, and the natural environment are considered in Landscape Design.

Congruent with this central purpose, the College seeks to instill in students a spirit of reasoned inquiry and those habits of intellectual discipline which are required for the critical thinking expected of free men and women. The College further seeks to acquaint students with their intellectual, cultural, and aesthetic heritage, and to provide them the skills necessary to cope with the com\u00ad plex human, societal, and technological problems of modern society. Finally, the College seeks to prepare students for entry into rewarding careers in a variety of fields and for advanced study that may be prerequisite to other opportunities. These objectives of a liberal education are achieved through the courses of instruction which form the undergraduate curricula of the College. Through satisfaction of the general and distributive requirements, students acquaint themselves with the diversity of approaches whereby people have come to understand themselves and their environment. As well, through satisfaction of the major and minor requirements, students can attain baccalaureate level mastery of a particular discipline or interdisciplinary area and significant depth of study in a second discipline or interdisciplinary area. The offices of the Dean of the College are located in Waterman Building.

Participation in these programs is limit\u00ad ed to those students who are specifically recommended by their department and who take a comprehensive examina\u00ad tion. A student who successfully completes this compre\u00ad hensive examination is granted a degree with Departmen\u00ad tal Honors. These programs are administered directly by the sponsoring department and information concerning them may be obtained from faculty advisors. REGULATIONS GOVERNING TRANSFER INTO THE COLLEGE A student who wishes to transfer to the College of Arts and Sciences from another college or school at the University ordi\u00ad narily must have a cumulative grade-point average of 2.50 or better, must have completed two semesters as a degree candi\u00ad date at the University, and must have taken the secondary school course work or subsequent college-level courses in those subjects required for admission to the University (see page 7). Consideration will also be given to those candidates for internal transfer whose cumulative grade-point averages fall within the range of 2.25 to 2.50. In these latter circumstances, a student must have a pre-college record which satisfies the current admission standards for the College of Arts and Sciences, must have demonstrated satisfactory performance in Arts and Sciences courses taken at the University, and must have established a pattern of improving overall academic per\u00ad formance. Applications for internal transfer may be submitted to the Office of the Dean at any time, but they will be reviewed only at the end of each semester. REGULATIONS GOVERNING ACADEMIC STANDARDS The following criteria for academic trial and dismissal, while making allowances for the student in the first semester, are designed to encourage academic work of quality at least equal to the minimum which is required for graduation. A. A student who earns a semester grade-point average higher than that which merits dismissal but below 2.00 (1.67 for first semester freshmen) are placed on trial. In order to avoid dismissal from the University, a student who has been placed on trial must earn a 2.00 semester average, enroll in all courses for a letter grade, and maintain a pro\u00ad gram of 12 or more credit hours during the following THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES | 55 semester. A student who is on trial may not enroll in a Uni\u00ad versity sanctioned study abroad program. B. A student who does not satisfy the conditions of trial, or who earns a semester grade-point average of 1.00 or lower, or who earns failing grades in one-half of the semester credit hours attempted (excluding courses in physical edu\u00ad cation and military studies) will be dismissed for low schol\u00ad arship. A student who is so dismissed may not enroll for any University course during the period of dismissal. MAJORS: DEPARTMENTAL REQUIREMENTS ANTHROPOLOGY Thirty hours in Anthropology including 21, 24, 26, and 28 (these provide an introduction to the disci\u00ad pline's four major fields); 225 and 228 (recommended for the junior year) and four additional advanced (100- or 200-level) courses of which only one may be an independent study and at least one must be at the 200 level. AREA AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES Entering students are invited to consider the option of concentrating in Area and International Studies. Courses in several academic disciplines can be combined so as to focus on a particular area of the world, thus providing an opportunity to test generalizations against the particular reality of a geographical area and its people. Undergraduates who major in Area Studies usually accumulate sufficient credit to enable them also to fulfill department re\u00ad quirements in one of the social sciences, humanities, or foreign languages. The four areas presently available for concentration are; CAN\u00ad ADA, LATIN AMERICA, RUSSIA/EAST EUROPE, EUROPE (Western, Northern, Mediterranean). ASIAN concentration is currently available only for those students who can fulfill the language requirement in their special field (see below). Minor programs are also available in these areas, as well as in a con\u00ad centration in Africa. For specific minor requirements, see page 62. The approach to undergraduate education combines exposure to the traditional disciplines with integrative knowledge and appreciation of a foreign culture and thus combines the broad liberal arts education with a more specific area competence. During their freshman and sophomore years, students who plan to major in Area Studies should take the required foreign language courses as well as beginning courses in the humani\u00ad ties and social sciences which are prerequisites for subsequent required courses and also meet the general distribution re\u00ad quirements. Students interested in concentrating in Area Studies are urged to contact the Director, Area and International Studies, 219 Old Mill, 656-1096. Specific requirements of the individual programs follow: Asian Studies A. In selecting courses from the Asian Studies listing, students must consult with an appropriate Asian Studies advisor and demonstrate in their choices thematic and/or geographic coherence. Such courses must also accord with the follow\u00ad ing requirements: B. The requirements for the major are 36 credit hours of courses including: 1. Two courses (one at/above 100 level) in each of the following three academic areas (six courses, 18 credit hours in all): a. History | THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES b. Social Analysis (i.e. Political Science, Economics, Anthropology, Sociology, Geography) c. Philosophy/Art/Religion Twelve credit hours (four three-credit courses or three four-credit courses) of a language of the geographical sub-area of concentration, or otherwise important for the focus of concentration. Note: Offerings of Asian language are limited at the University and majors may have to fulfill this requirement through study elsewhere. Determination of credit equivalents for language competence not acquired through formal course work will be. made by appropriate faculty members. One advanced course (three credits) in either: a. A disciplinary theory or method course at the 200 level (such as Anthropology 210 or Religion 201), or b. Readings and Research 197, 198 in which a research paper is produced.

PREPROFESSIONAL PREPARATION Students who plan to enter professional colleges requiring previous collegiate preparation will find the variety of courses offered in the College of Arts and Sciences and the freedom of election in that College is such that all the requirements for any professional school may be met. Many students will desire to direct their four-year undergraduate courses to provide, in ad\u00ad dition to a sound general education, appropriate preprofes- sional training for later work in the medical sciences, law, or theology. Special advising is available in the College for students prepar\u00ad ing for careers in education, journalism, law, and medical sciences. BIOLOGY A major in Biology is offered to students enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences. It has been designed for the student who wishes to concentrate in Biology while pursuing a liberal arts education. It will also serve as a basis for programs leading to graduate study in biological fields and as an appro\u00ad priate major for students in premedicai and predental pro\u00ad grams. Majors may pursue either the B.A. or the B.S. degree. For specific requirements for these degrees, please see page 53- 54. JOURNALISM Admission to schools of journalism is general\u00ad ly open to academically-qualified students who hold the Bache\u00ad lor of Arts degree with concentration in any discipline. Interest\u00ad ed students should take a broad program in the liberal arts, in\u00ad cluding work in the social sciences and in English. LAW American law schools, as a rule, require graduation from a four-year college with a Bachelor's degree prior to ad\u00ad mission. There is no prescribed curriculum for admission to law school, and candidates pursue their undergraduate studies in a wide range of majors. A Pre-Law Advisory Committee aids students in planning their academic programs and in making application to law schools. Members of the committee include: Professor Holland, Department of Political Science; Professor Stanfield, Department of Sociology; Professor Haltom, Depart\u00ad ment of Political Science; Professor Ashman, Department of Merchandising, Consumer Studies, and Design; Professor Warhol, Department of English; Larry Simmons, Center for Career Development. THEOLOGY Graduation from a four-year college is prerequi\u00ad site for admission to most theological seminaries. Although no prescribed curriculum is demanded as preparation for such professional schools, the student is advised to elect substantial\u00ad ly from the departments of languages (particularly classics), history, philosophy, religion, psychology, and sociology. OPTOMETRY The requirements for admission to schools of optometry vary, but typically they include courses in English, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and zoology with a mini\u00ad mum of two years of college work. PHARMACY Under the Regional Plan (page 9) Vermont residents may prepare for pharmacy school at Connecticut or Rhode Island. This is a five-year undergraduate program con\u00ad centrating in pharmacy, which includes two years of preprofes-sional work in English, mathematics, botany, chemistry, zoology, physics, social science, and fine arts. MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY The prevailing requirements for admission to an accredited medical college include a minimum of three years of undergraduate work but most insti\u00ad tutions recommend four years. It is strongly urged that stu\u00ad dents desiring to enter medical college should during their sophomore year consult catalogues of colleges to which they expect to apply, and arrange to include in their program courses required by those schools. They should also keep in\u00ad formed of events and deadlines relating to the application pro\u00ad cess by contacting the Office of Career Development. Each student, in consultation with his/her advisor, plans a four-year program of courses which will fulfill the require\u00ad ments for a Bachelor's degree. To meet the minimum require\u00ad ments of most medical colleges, the program should include the following: Mathematics, one of the following options: (a) Math. 21,22 (recommended for able students) (b) Math. 19,20 (adequate) (c) Math. 9, 2; 21 or 19, 20 (suggested for students not immediately prepared to enter calculus) Chemistry, two years minimum, with laboratory Chemistry 1,2, or 11, 12, 13,14 (recommended for potential Chemistry majors) Chemistry 141,142 (required) Physics, one year minimum, with laboratory (a) Physics 21,31 and 22, 42 (recommended for students with calculus background) (b) Physics 21, 31 and 125 (recommended for students concentrating in the physical sciences or engineering) (c) Physics 11,21 and 12, 22 (acceptable for students without calculus background, or taking calculus concurrently) Biology, one year minimum, with laboratory Biology 1,2 Students who enter an accredited medical college after three years (90 hours) of undergraduate work may, on application and after completing one year of medical study, qualify as can\u00ad didates for a Bachelor of Science degree. The requirements for admission to colleges of dentistry vary, but in all cases include at least three years of college work. (The majority of applicants will have completed four years.) In general, the minimum requirements given above should be used in planning a program leading to entrance into a dental school. Students should consult catalogues of the dental col\u00ad leges to which they expect to apply in order to make certain all requirements are met. In general, students should avoid taking courses at the under\u00ad graduate level in those areas taught at the professional level: i.e. human anatomy, human physiology, microbiology. Many medical colleges now strongly recommend or require that students enroll in courses in the humanities and social sciences. SECONDARY TEACHING Students in the College of Arts and Sciences may, upon application to the Dean of Education and Social Services, be accepted into the teacher training pro\u00ad gram for secondary education. Application should be made before the end of the sophomore year. The prescribed courses in education, up to 24 credit hours, can count as electives towards the Bachelor of Arts. Students completing this pro\u00ad gram are eligible for Secondary Teacher's Certification. The College of Education and Social Services The College of Education and Social Services offers under\u00ad graduate programs in: Art Education \u2014 Grades K-12 Elementary Education \u2014 Grades K-6 Music Education \u2014 Grades K-12 Early Childhood Health Education Physical Education \u2014 Grades K-12 Secondary Education \u2014 Grades 7-12 Social Work Human Development and Family Studies These curricula are designed to prepare graduates for early childhood and human development positions, social work, kindergarten-elementary schools, junior high schools, and assignments calling for subject specialties in elementary, secondary, and twelve-grade situations. Programs are compos\u00ad ed of general education, professional education, and profes\u00ad sional laboratory experiences. The College has developed course clusters in the area of reading-language arts and special education. The Responsive Teacher Program prepares elementary and secondary regular classroom teachers with special competencies for enhancing the social, personal, and academic growth of handicapped learners. The Reading Concentration Program provides classroom and special area teachers with an extensive background of skills and understandings in the area of reading and language arts and the relationship of the communications skills to the total school curriculum.

Students are responsible for obtaining specific information regarding degree requirements and teacher certification from the appropriate College of Education and Social Services office. FIFTH-YEAR CERTIFICATE IN EDUCATION A special fifth-year program culminating in a certificate of advanced study is offered for students who wish to work beyond the THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION AND SOCIAL SERVICES | 73 Bachelor's degree but who need or desire more flexibility than is possible in any of the standard programs for Master's degrees. The certificate program is especially designed to meet the needs of teachers who are developing new teaching fields, for advanced students who are meeting requirements for state cer\u00ad tification, and for experienced teachers who desire flexibility in choice of courses at both graduate and undergraduate levels. Each certificate program is individualized to fit the qualifica\u00ad tions and the professional objectives of the candidate. Under\u00ad graduate courses may be approved for the program when such courses appropriately support the candidate's professional ob\u00ad jectives. The program for the Fifth-Year Certificate is governed by the following regulations: 1. Candidates must hold a Bachelor's degree. 2. Candidates must make written application on forms obtained from the Office of the Dean of the College of Education and Social Services. 3. Candidates are admitted to the program by action of a faculty committee. 4. A maximum of 12 credits may be applied to the program at the time of admission. 5. A maximum of nine credits may be transferred from other institutions. 6. Credits for the program may be earned in the regular academic year, the Summer Session, and the Evening Division. 7. The program for each candidate must include a minimum of 30 credits approved by a faculty advisor. 8. A minimum mark of C must be made in any course which is to be included in the program. 9. No comprehensive examination or formal thesis is required for completion of the program, but the candidate will submit a culminating paper under the direction of his/her faculty advisor. 10. The program must be completed within seven years after the time of admission. Requests for further information about fifth-year programs should be directed to the Office for Student and Field Services, Waterman Building. CERTIFICATE OF ADVANCED STUDY A certificate of Ad\u00ad vanced Study (C.A.S. \u2014 sixth-year certificate), a 30-36 graduate credit hour program beyond the Master's degree, is offered by the College of Education and Social Services in the field of Ad\u00ad ministration and Planning, Counseling, and Integrated Studies. The C.A.S. has become a professional requirement in the hiring and advancement of administrative, supervisory, and other personnel in many school districts throughout the United States. The program requires a nine credit on-campus residen\u00ad cy unit. Residency may be fulfilled during any academic semester or summer and is part of the total 30-36 program credits. Further information may be obtained from the Office for Student and Field Services, Waterman Building. 40W' ^p^-4- m \u00bb j*/* - \u00b0 * * * *, s i \"4. \u00ab* < v ,:,/.* < rw$h; i The Division of Engineering, Mathematics, and Business Administration The Division of Engineering, Mathematics, and Business Administration includes the College of Engineering and Mathematics and the School of Business Administration. The Division offers professional undergraduate programs for either professional practice or further study. Because graduates of professional schools are expected to be able to plan and direct in many work situations, as well as to effect and manage change, the primary objective of professional education is to develop skills in problem solving. Professional graduates must have the ability, confidence, and self-discipline to identify and define a problem; break it down into operable components; gather the necessary resources from the natural and social sciences, mathematics, and the humanities; and employ these resources to solve the problem. The Division promotes these qualities in students by empha\u00ad sizing a balance between concept and skill in all curricula. The Division is also committed to learning as a life-long endea\u00ad vor and, therefore, provides a base for students to buiid on as their careers and personal interests broaden. The offices of the Dean of the Division are located in the Votey Building. DEGREE PROGRAMS The Bachelor of Science degree is awarded for the following majors: Business Administration Civil Engineering Computer Science Electrical Engineering Management Engineering Mathematics Mechanical Engineering HONORS PROGRAMS FOR EMBA STUDENTS INDIVIDUALLY DESIGNED MAJOR A student matriculating in the Division who, at the time of ap\u00ad plication, has completed at least three semesters of full-time study with a cumulative grade-point average of 3.0 or above may propose an individually designed major which builds on an appropriate core program of the Division. The program is designed for the superior student with exceptional initiative and must contain a breadth and depth of courses consistent with regular professional programs or options. The program must be sponsored by a faculty member who will serve as the student's advisor. The program requires prior approval by the appropriate Studies Committee. HONORS THESIS PROGRAM The undergraduate thesis program \u2014 designed for the superior student with unusual initiative and intellectual curiosity \u2014 provides an opportunity to pursue a special program without the restrictions of classroom routine. The student must be matriculated in the Division at the time of application and have a cumulative grade-point average of at least 3.0 for sophomore and junior work. The honors thesis program is a program of reading, research, design, or creation under the direction of the school, department, or program of the student's choice (not necessarily within the Division). For example, a student might do a special honors thesis in Physics. The unit establishes the mechanism for thesis review, and the proposal must be ap\u00ad proved by the Division Dean's Office no later than the end of the junior year. The thesis, in the form of a written report, must be approved by the participating unit. The student may also be required to pass an oral or written examination at the discre\u00ad tion of the unit as part of the mechanism for review. At the time of graduation, the student's transcript and the graduation program will appropriately be denoted with \"Honors Thesis\" and the title of the thesis. Some programs within the Division require senior projects as part of the prescribed curriculum. For the superior student, these projects may offer opportunities similar to the honors thesis program. COOPERATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAM The Division offers a cooperative education (CO-OP) program to students with cumulative grade-point averages placing them in the upper half of their class. Before acceptance, each candi\u00ad date must be interviewed and approved by the program coordi\u00ad nator and the prospective employer. The program lets students apply their learning to a full-time, paid position in a business, industrial, or government setting. It is designed to fit into a nor\u00ad mal four-year academic program. In each curriculum area, there is a faculty member responsible for CO-OP students, ser\u00ad ving also as the students' academic advisor and coordinating on-site visits to work assignments. Participants must submit learning objectives and an end-of-work report at the end of each assignment. Although the Division attempts to place all qualified students admitted to the program, it cannot guarantee the availability of positions. The CO-OP office is located in the Center for Career Develop\u00ad ment in E Building of the Living/Learning Center. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS AND ACADEMIC REGULATIONS ACADEMIC STANDARDS Students who receive a cumulative or semester grade-point average of less than 2.0 will be placed on trial. Students who have failed half their course credits for any semester, or who have had two successive semester averages below 2.0, or three successive semesters in which their cumulative grade-point average falls below 2,0, are eligible for dismissal. To receive a degree in a major, stude nts must have a minimum cumulative average of 2.0. Students must complete 30 of the last 45 hours of credit in residence at the University of Vermont as matriculated students in the Division of Engineering, Mathe\u00ad matics, and Business Administration. Additional degree re\u00ad quirements are specified for each major. CREDIT FOR MILITARY SERVICE The Division does not, in general, grant credit for military ser\u00ad vice. Credit for specific courses or other academic experience acquired during military service may be available through peti\u00ad tion to the appropriate Studies Committee. CREDIT FOR CALCULUS Credit will be given for Math. 21, or Math. 21 and 22, to those students who have not taken the advanced placement test in mathematics and who successfully complete Math. 121 with a B or better, when those students apply for it. 76 | THE DIVISION OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS, AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION PHYSICAL EDUCATION In addition to the course requirements listed for each curricu\u00ad lum, all students must satisfactorily complete two credits of physical education activities. RESEARCH AND SPECIAL PROJECTS Opportunities for undergraduate research and work on special projects are offered by the School, departments, and programs of the Division. Credit may be arranged, with a maximum of four hours per semester. No more than 12 hours of courses in these categories may be used to satisfy the requirements for the B.S. degree. It is understood that credit for such courses is con\u00ad tingent upon submission of a final report or other acceptable evidence of project completion. TRANSFER CREDIT Transfer credits from other institutions are not used in the cal\u00ad culation of the University of Vermont grade-point average. Stu\u00ad dents who wish transfer credit must obtain approval from their department or School. School of Business Administration The School of Business Administration offers a challenging and rigorous education to prepare its students for promising careers in industry, government, and non-profit organizations. The graduates from this program will be equipped with the broad knowledge and analytical tools needed to operate effec\u00ad tively as line and staff managers in the rapidly changing man\u00ad agement environment. The program is designed to cultivate the student's capacity to recognize, define, and solve problems in the most efficient manner possible. To this end, we require that the student be exposed to a wide range of courses in the arts, humanities, and the social and physical sciences. The first two years establish the broad intellectual base upon which the art and science of management are built and are devoted to partial completion of distribution requirements and to acquisition of the technical skills on which upper level management courses rely. The junior year completes the business core. Eight required courses develop the framework for organizing information and structuring analysis in the context of an operating enterprise. Course work is offered in finance, human resource manage\u00ad ment in a global environment, information systems, market\u00ad ing, and production, in addition to the accounting courses taken in the sophomore year. We believe that a broad but demanding program is in the best interest of the student's career opportunities. The final year is devoted to senior business electives, the re\u00ad quired business policy course, and free electives. The School of Business Administration also cooperates with the College of Engineering and Mathematics in offering a B.S. in Management Engineering. The course offerings are de\u00ad scribed on page 83. The offices of the School of Business Administration are located in Mansfield House. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS A minimum of 122 approved semester hours is required for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in\u00ad cluding two required hours in physical education and a mini\u00ad mum of 55 hours in areas other than business administration and upper-level economics. Physical education courses in excess of the required two credits will not count toward the 122 credits required for grad\u00ad uation. The 55 hours must be completed within the following guide\u00ad lines: A. Language and Literature: 1. English 1 (three hours) 2. Any two of the following: English 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, or 50 (six hours) 3.

Computer science courses cannot be used to fulfill this requirement. D. The remainder of the 55 hours must be selected from one or more of areas A, B, or C above. ADMISSION TO UPPER LEVEL BUSINESS PROGRAM In order to be admitted to the Upper Level program of the School and therefore to continue as a major in the School, an undergraduate must: A. Have completed at least 54 credits with an average of 2.0 or better. B. Have obtained a minimum GPA in the Freshman/ Sophomore Core of: 1. 2.25 with the Math. 19-20 sequence or 2. 2.10 with the Math. 21-22 sequence AREAS OF STUDY A business student will normally take the following schedule: FRESHMAN YEAR *Math. 19 or21 English 1 Psychology 1 or Sociology 1 Computer Science 11 THE DIVISION OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS, AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION | 77 8SAD 191, Business Policy 1st 2nd SEMESTER 3 or 4 3 3 3 Economics 11,12 3 3 Distribution Elective 3 or 4 Math. 20 or 22 - 3 or 4 History 7 or 8, or Political Science 21 - 3 One of English 21-26 3 15-16 15-17 1st 2nd SOPHOMORE YEAR SEMESTER BSAD 60, 61 4 4 English 50 (or 21-26) 3 Distribution Electives 6 or 7 9 or 10 Statistics 141 3 Technology 80 - 3 16-17 16d7 Denotes Freshman/Sophomore Core During the junior year, the student will take courses in all of the functional areas of management and will do additional work in economics, quantitative methods, and the socio-politi\u00ad cal environment in which business functions. The junior core courses are: BSAD 120 Principles of Management and Organizational Behavior 3 BSAD 132 Legal and Political Environment of Business 3 BSAD 141 Management Information Systems 3 BSAD 154 Marketing Management 3 BSAD 172 Managerial Economics 3 BSAD 173 Production and Operations Analysis I 3 BSAD 180 Managerial Finance 3 Quantitative Methods* 3 The three hours required in quantitative methods may be satisfied by selecting a course from among Statistics 151,201,221,225,229,231, or Business Administration 170,177, or 179. JUNIOR YEAR Junior Business Core Elective 1st 2nd SEMESTER 12 12 3 ' 3 15 15 In the senior year, the student must complete at least 12 addi\u00ad tional hours in upper level elective business courses beyond those required in the Junior/Senior Core. These courses must be selected in such a way that they build upon prior work and upon each other and point toward the analysis of a coherent subset of managerial problems. An acceptable approach is to concentrate these courses in one of the areas of Accounting, Finance, Human Resource Management, Management Infor\u00ad mation Systems, Marketing, International Management, or Pro\u00ad duction and Operations Management. However, the student may also complete a cross-functional program. In either case, the specific set of upper level business electives must be ap\u00ad proved by the student's advisor. See page 76 for a detailed list\u00ad ing and description of courses in the various functional areas. SENIOR YEAR Senior Business Elective Electives 1st 2nd SEMESTER 6 6 9 6 15 3 TiT Additional course work needed to meet the 122 hour require\u00ad ment for graduation are free electives and may be satisfied by any UVM course subject to two restrictions: 1. No more than two hours in physical education may be counted toward the 122; 2. No credit will be granted for a course if credit has been received previously in a more advanced course in the same general discipline. Beginning with the Class of 1987, students are required to achieve a cumulative average of 2.0 in the junior/senior busi\u00ad ness course work. PROFESSIONAL ACCOUNTING PROGRAM Students planning to sit for the CPA examination should com\u00ad plete the Professional Accounting Program outlined below. Completion of the Professional Accounting Program satisfies the upper level elective business course requirement. BSAD17 Business Law 3 BSAD 161,162 Intermediate Accounting 6 BSAD 164 Introduction to Federal Taxation 3 BSAD 168 Cost Accounting 3 BSAD 166 Advanced Accounting 3 BSAD 167 Auditing 3 Additionally, a second Business Law course (BSAD 18) and a second Finance course (beyond BSAD 180) are recommended. These two additional courses are required for students who plan to sit for the CPA examination in New York. INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT The program in international management is open to all Busi\u00ad ness Administration majors and includes up to a full academic year in an overseas business program. The University has formal arrangements with both the Univer\u00ad sity of Nice and the University of Grenoble. In the Nice pro\u00ad gram, students will spend one year abroad completing a total of 10 courses. Four of these will substitute for Junior Core courses and three or four will constitute international management electives. The remaining courses will be European culture/ society and will substitute for distribution requirements. ALL INSTRUCTION IS IN FRENCH. Students are required to demonstrate proficiency in French which is well beyond the intermediate level. The Grenoble program gives the student the opportunity to spend the spring semester at the University of Grenoble. The program consists of 14 credit hours in international business, French culture and society, and the French language. All courses are taught in English; however, students are advised that some background in French is desirable. It is also possible for students to spend a year at other Euro\u00ad pean and Canadian universities under the international man\u00ad agement program. These individually designed programs may be arranged in consultation with the program advisor. For further information on these programs, contact Professor Cats-Baril at 656-4015. The College of Engineering and Mathematics The College of Engineering and Mathematics offers undergrad\u00ad uate curricula in Civil Engineering, Computer Science, Electri\u00ad78 I THE DIVISION OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS, AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION cal Engineering, Management Engineering, Mathematics, and Mechanical Engineering, leading to the Bachelor of Science degree. The offices of the Dean of the College are located in the Votey Building.

Political Science Psychology Sociology A. Social Science to include: Anthropology Economics Geography History B. Humanities, Fine Arts, and Philosophy to include: Language Music Literature Speech Art Philosophy Drama Religion Courses used to fill the other requirements may not be used to fill the distribution requirement. A typical program in Computer Science is as follows: ACADEMIC STANDARDS In order to continue as a major in the College of Engineering and Mathematics, a student must achieve a 2.0 cumulative grade-point average at the completion of the semester in which 60 cumulative credit hours have been attempted. No more than three repeated course enrollments are allowed during this 60-credit period. In the case of transfer students, applicable transfer credits will be included in determining the 60 credit hours, but grades in these courses will not be included in the grade-point average. Credit will not be given for more than three courses in the junior and senior curricula for which a grade of D or D- is earned. This does not apply to the distribution requirements associated with the Humanities and Social Sciences. AREAS OF STUDY COMPUTER SCIENCE CURRICULUM Computer Science is one of the mathematical sciences, although there are strong ties to electrical engineering. It is the study of the theoretical basis, design, and application of elec\u00ad tronic computing machines. The Computer Science curriculum provides a broad basic training in Computer Science with required courses in the theory of computing, hardware design, and software tech\u00ad niques. A minor specialization in an allied field is required so that students develop an appreciation for the applicability of their knowledge of computer science. Requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Com\u00ad puter Science are as follows: Computer Science: 11, 12, 101, 102, 103,104, plus four 200- level courses. One of these must be 224 or 243. Two are to be chosen from 201,203,222. Mathematics: 21,22,104,121,124,173 Electrical 151 Other: English 1, Speech 11 Minor Field: Six semester courses for a minimum of 18 credits in an allied area. Suggested areas are: business administration, social science, physical science, biological science, or engi\u00ad neering. Students who wish to minor in mathematics or statis\u00ad tics may do so and are required to take only four courses numbered 200 or above in the area of their choice. In order to assure that the courses chosen to constitute the minor specialization form a cohesive unit, all minor programs must be approved by a Computer Science faculty advisor. Distribution Requirements: A student must complete at least two semester courses for a minimum of six credits in each of the two areas: 1st 2nd SEMESTER 3 4 3 4-3 6 3 3 4 3 Iff\" FM6 1st 2nd SEMESTER 3 4 3 4 3 3 3 3 4-3 3 TT 16-15 1st 2nd JUNIOR YEAR SEMESTER CS 103, Prog.

UNDECIDED - NATURAL RESOURCES High school seniors who do not wish to decide among the vari\u00ad ous programs in (he School are admitted as \"Undecided- NR\" majors and may remain in this category a maximum of two years. These students and their advisors develop a one- or two- year curriculum which enables them to explore several fields of natural resources before committing to a specific major. *v Courses of Instruction The University reserves the right to change course offerings at any time. The departments and areas of instruction are arranged alpha\u00ad betically, and the college/school in which each is located is in\u00ad dicated. A student who lacks the stated prerequisites for a course may be permitted to enroll by the instructor. Such students must in\u00ad form the instructor that they lack the prerequisites, and the in\u00ad structor will make appropriate efforts to ascertain that they are properly qualified. Courses are divided into three levels: introductory, intermedi\u00ad ate, and advanced. Where appropriate, a department may limit enrollment in a particular course. Such limitations, other than class size, must be explicitly stated. Courses numbered from 1-99 are introductory courses. Intro\u00ad ductory courses emphasize basic concepts of the discipline. In general, they presuppose no previous college work in the sub\u00ad ject. The only exceptions to this rule are those cases in which there is a two-semester introductory sequence. In such cases, the second semester course may have the first semester course as a prerequisite. Courses numbered from 100-199 are intermediate courses. An intermediate course covers more advanced material than that treated in introductory courses. Students will be expected to be familiar with the basic concepts of the subject and the course will present more difficult ideas. Intermediate courses will generally be more specialized than introductory courses. An intermediate course will always have a minimum prerequisite of three hours prior study in the discipline or in another speci\u00ad fied discipline. Courses numbered from 200-299 are advanced courses. An ad\u00ad vanced course presents concepts, results, or arguments which are only accessible to students who have taken courses in the discipline (or, occasionally, in a related discipline) at the intro\u00ad ductory and intermediate levels. Prior acquaintance with the basic concepts of the subject and with some special areas of the subject will be assumed. Ah advanced course will always have a minimum prerequisite of three hours prior study at the inter\u00ad mediate level in the discipline, or in a related discipline, or some specified equivalent preparation. Some, but not all, 200-Ievel courses carry graduate credit. Graduate students must refer to the UVM Graduate Catalogue which lists all courses carrying graduate credit. Seniors who wish to take a course for graduate credit must receive permis\u00ad sion through the office of their dean (see page 33) prior to enrolling in the course. Some departments make further subdivisions of courses at some levels. Where this applies, an explanation can be found at the beginning of the department's list of courses. Two numerals separated by a comma (as in 17, 18) indicate that the separate semester courses may be taken independent\u00ad ly for credit. Two numerals separated by a hyphen (as in 17-18) indicate that the semester courses may not be taken in\u00ad dependently for credit, and, unless otherwise stated, they must be taken in the sequence indicated. In cases where two numerals are separated either by a comma or by a hyphen, the odd-numbered course will be taught in the fall and the even- numbered course in the spring. The number of credit hours per semester is stated in each course description. For some courses, the course title is followed by a pair of numerals connected by a hyphen and en\u00ad closed in parentheses (as in (2-3)); this form indicates the number of class hours respectively of lecture and laboratory.

For placement in advanced language courses (100 or above), first- year students should consult with this department. Students may not take a language course lower than the level most recently attained except with the permission of the department. This stricture does not apply to literature or civilization courses.

LITERATURE COURSES IN FRENCH AND SPANISH As the language courses offer a continuum for the learning of the four skills, the literature courses provide a sequential study of the development of French and Spanish literatures from the Middle Ages to the present. In addition, they offer both practice and continued training in the four language skills. While the lit\u00ad erature courses are divided into centuries, with subcategories of genres, themes, and individual authors, it is not essential to adhere strictly to chronological order. In general, a 100- level literature course or its equivalent is the prereq\u00ad uisite for all other literature courses: exceptions are regularly made with the approval of the department. Unless otherwise stated, all courses above the intermediate level will be conducted in the foreign language in question. Questions about the precise content of any literature course should be referred to the instructor listed for the course or to the department chairperson.
