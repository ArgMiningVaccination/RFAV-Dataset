After all, we are mammals, so it makes sense for animal-based ingredients to be most biologically compatible to us! Many of our customers find moisturizing relief from dry, sensitive or allergy-prone skin with our 100% Grassfed (and finished) Tallow. Because our unique Tallow is homegrown and minimally processed it is some of the highest quality available. Our animals are never given antibiotics, hormones, GMOs, nor mRNA vaccines. They graze on pastures free of pesticides. Benefits of using our Tallow include - Traditional - Tallow has been used as an effective skincare ingredient for centuries! Our ancestors wisely used animal fats along with plant concoctions for a variety of skin and healthcare needs. As a skin moisturizer tallow has stood the test of time because of its luxurious emollient properties. It has been recently rediscovered for the important role it plays in nutritional bioavailability. Safe - We often say, \"If you wouldn't eat it, don't put it on your skin!\" Tallow is as healthy to use on your skin as it is to eat. Effective - Although most evidence for Tallow's effectiveness is anecdotal, there are countless reports and rave reviews on how well it helps skin issues! Nutritious - We had our buffalo tallow tested for its fatty acid profile and vitamin content. The sample came from suet that was frozen for 7 months and may have been slightly diluted. Still, we discovered it contains notable levels of: - CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid), an Omega-3 isomer of linolenic acid. Topically, it fortifies the skin barrier and helps skin retain moisture by boosting ceramide synthesis in the cells. Ours contains 495 mg/100g. - Vitamins A, D, E and K. It's worth noting that all beta carotene in water buffalo tallow is already converted into retinol, the most bioavailable form of Vitamin A. It contains 205 IU/100g. Vitamin K1 is .16 ug/g and A. E) are Alpha Linolenic Acid at .52%, stearic acid at 36.42%, and other fatty acids that promote skin health in its naturally balanced state. - Trace amounts of selenium, manganese, zinc, and glutathione. See the Nutritional Analysis for our water buffalo tallow below! Additionally, ours is: Home Grown - Most of the tallow we use is from livestock raised on our farms in Monroe, Madison, and Covington, Georgia. Our ruminant animals eat a variety of cool season grasses, warm season grasses, legumes, and forbs growing in holistically managed soil. Our tallow tends to be stiffer than commercial tallow thanks to its high content of naturally occurring stearic acid. Home Rendered - Our Tallow is dry rendered using stainless steel equipment and stored in glass containers or BPA-free food grade plastic tubs. Additionally, we never refine or \"purify\" our tallow with the salt water boiling method that's popular these days. Suet is a very pure fat by nature, which is what makes it an ideal fat for skincare. It only needs to be properly trimmed, gently warmed to separate it from the protein tissues that encapsulate it (cracklings) and lightly filtered to remove any remaining bits. This minimal processing preserves the precious vitamins found in tallow and prevents the growth of pathogens such as bacteria, yeast, and mold that water exposure can lead to.

Hypoallergenic and Non-comedogenic - Our Tallow is rendered only from Suet (cavity fat surrounding the kidneys). Rendered subcutaneous fats are often confused with or mixed with suet and called \"tallow\". But fat drained off of meat may be contaminated with blood and other tissue. It's not harmful, but not what we consider the purest or the best quality for skincare. Additionally, pure, unrefined tallow will not clog pores! Expect These Additional Benefits When Using Our Tallow Skincare Products Long Lasting Moisture - The emollient properties of our balms and body butters last all day, without the need to reapply. Easy and Fun to Use - Our balms fit the definition of a Balm, although we find it unnecessary to include a wax in most products. We do not call them \"creams\" because they are anhydrous (contain no water). Lovely essential oil scents in some products are intended to positively affect mood and promote well-being. We offer plenty of unscented versions for our customers with sensitivities, too! Skincare is one of the best forms of self-care, so relax and enjoy the benefits of real nourishment for your skin! Overall Improvement in Skin Health - Give your skin time to reap the benefits of the continued use of our products. Many people report relief from dryness, itching, redness, eczema, acne, and uneven "}
