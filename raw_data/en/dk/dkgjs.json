Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2023 Color: Note : to Ensure Proper Assembly, Please Follow All Steps Provided in the Installation Manual (Provided in Pdf Below)Size: SofaPattern Name: Sofa [Verified Purchase](/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_avp?nodeId=G75XTB7MBMBTXP6W) Bought this couch to put in my living room. It was super easy to put together and fits nicely in the small area of my apartment living room. In my opinion this couch is a little firm if you're going to be laying on it. Not necessarily a bad thing if you're maybe a bit heavier set or if you have more than one person sitting on it. The back cushions are comfy when sitting but terrible when laying down, I had to take them off so I could fit on the couch without the risk of rolling off. Otherwise this is a great value for someone living in a small apartment. Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2023 Other than that, I'm thrilled to pieces with it. The seat is firm and the cushions are not removable which is perfect for me. I am 5'2\" tall so I can lounge on this comfortably with the back cushions removed. It makes my tiny living room look twice the size. I can sit on it with my feet touching the floor, which is truly a joy. :) I've only had it for a day, so I have no idea how well it will wear. Overall, I am very happy with it.

We had to snip off several. The seats (bottom) are a bit hard, so hopefully they will soften up after use.

However, I'd previously purchased two bed frames from this vendor/brand and they've been excellent quality, super sturdy and well priced. The sofa was easy to assemble but it is small (the seat back is a bit low). Works perfectly for me as I'm only 5'4\" but I don't see this working for anyone taller than 5'8\" bc it is rather \"miniature.\" On the plus side, I have put it in my bedroom and have created a mini living room inside my bedroom with this loveseat and an accent chair I also bought on Amazon.

The back cushions, as shown by another reviewer, are a little small. If you pull them all the way to the ends of the couch, there's a gap in the middle. The color is what I expected. ASSEMBLY: This was very easy to assemble. I did it myself in less than 15 minutes (if you include the unpacking process)... maybe 5-7 minutes for actual assembly. It would have been easier with a second person though since all the parts slide into each other and the seat part is heavy... gets a little awkward wrangling everything yourself. Find a friend to help you assemble. No tools needed. Can easily be taken apart for moving/transporting. Not sure what that means in terms of durability/stability though. Overall, it's an okay couch. I wish I had paid closer to $250 for it instead of the $350 I paid. I don't know that I would buy it again, personally. I could see some people loving this couch more than me if they are smaller than me or have a smaller living space. My dog seems to like it (see photos). For scale, my dog is 45lbs (mixed breed).

Its almost a light light greyish beige depending on the lighting but still deffinetly just a nice beige color. The assembly was super easy. I did most of it by myself within 30/45 minutes. Two people would take like 15 minutes. Overall exactly what you would want from an online amazon couch.... but its not the most comfortable. The bottom seats are built in, you cant take them off at all and they have very little plush. the back coushions are more comfortable than the bottom seat. I do feel like overtime the bottom coushions will get more comfortable but as of now they are firm. IT is small.. like short both in length and seat depth. im 5'2 and when i lay down on it my feet go over the side so its not really for lounging or napping :( the height of the back is good not to low and i can sit criss cross on the seat comfortably. Overall everything BUT the loveseat being super comfortable is holding it back from 5 stars. but for the price and convience of everything else definetly makes it worth it. SIDE NOTE* I bought my bed frame and mattress from the same brand ZINUS and i find their stuff to be very nice (similar to ikea) with assembly and the quailty is good too.
