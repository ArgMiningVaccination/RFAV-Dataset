The Teen Healthy Eating and Active Living (HEAL) Internship Program, co-sponsored by Chinatown YMCA, is designed to empower youths to improve their nutritional and physical well-being, as well as fostering leadership skills. The Teen HEAL Internship Program is funded through the Chinese Community Health Care Association (CCHCA) grant, which strives to improve the health of those within the Chinese community. Applicants were recruited through various high schools, Chinese clubs, and the Community Improvement Service. The most qualified applicants were selected to become Teen HEAL interns. The program was started in 2019 and this is the third year of the Teen HEAL internship program which ran from July 2021 to June 2022. During the internship, interns were taught 8 nutrition skills: building a healthy plate, shopping smart, making healthy snacks, eating out right, manag - ing your weight, staying active, exploring the benefits of organic food and vegetarianism, managing stress, and healthy cooking. They also learned various leadership skills, such as program planning, goal setting, public speaking, communication strategies, and social awareness. Interns utilized their nutrition and leadership training to serve their peers by leading a HEAL club at their schools to promote healthy cooking, healthy eating habits and active lifestyles. They also serve the community by teaching monthly Zoom club classes and to children at Chinatown YMCA, summer camps at the Asian Woman Resource Center and the seniors at Self Help for the Elderly and other senior housing units. Congratulations to the following 21 interns: 2Foreword byCatherine Wong M.P .H., R.D. Dear HEAL interns, Congratulations on graduating from our 2021-2022 Teen HEAL program amidst this pandemic year! Your diligence, eagerness to learn, and passion to share healthy eating and active living knowl - edge to your classmates, friends, family, and the community have truly impressed me! During the last year, you were trained on 8 nutrition skills, 6 leadership skills, and served the community via conducting 4 Zoom club meetings, 10 community workshops, and 2 media interviews! And through the 6 HEAL clubs in Galileo, Lick Wilmerding, Lowell, Mission, St. Ignatius, and Washington High School, you conducted a total of 54 trainings and 670 encounters! That is an amazing number of students that you all outreached to together during this pandemic year! I am so proud of all your accomplishments! I have seen you blos - som into more confident individuals\u2014all equipped with the power to improve your healthy lifestyle habits, impact others in the HEAL community, and in your OWN school community! I am impressed by your creativity and perseverance during these unprecedented times. Despite moving to virtual trainings, we still met and exceed - ed the objectives of the internship. When I read your testimonials, I was touched and encouraged by all the changes you made to live a healthier lifestyle and how you impacted your friends and family. You've learned to shop in a healthy manner, read nutrition labels, and substitute healthy ingre - dients when cooking. I am happy to know that you have learned the correct principles for weight management and dining out right, while also increasing your exercise levels by trying different forms of physical activity. I am glad that you are able to get to know your - self more, and that our program has inspired you to continue pur - suing your interests and putting your best effort to achieve your life goals. I am impressed by the dedication many of you have put into the program, from participating in the production of KTSF Public Service Announcements, to teaching at Chinatown YMCA, Asian Women Resource Center, and the senior housing center! I want to thank my leadership team and especially Juliana Chen, my lead intern. They are my left and right hands when it comes to handling a lot of the administration and the creation of many Powerpoints, exams, and the Kahoot questions for evaluation for each of the nutrition skills! I am indebted to Denise Hung, Teen director at Chinatown YMCA, who helped me teach all the leadership trainings throughout the year, and Vivian Wong R.D. who helped me teach most of the nutrition trainings, as well as Sunny Pak M.D., my TCM faculty, Stephanie Le M.D., my acting Medical Director, Priti Rane M.S., R.D., my Director of Nutrition Services and Hali Hammer M.D., my Director of Ambulatory Care, who have supported and encour - aged me during the pandemic months. Lastly, I am so proud of each of you for sharing your champion stories and creating your own healthy recipes for this booklet. I strongly believe you will be able to continue to live a healthy lifestyle by practicing what you have learned in the Teen HEAL program. You will always hold a special place in my heart, and remember that you can always contact me with any questions. Re - member your 3 Rs! Make wise decisions in life! Stay connected in our HEAL community. With lots of love, Catherine Wong, M.P .H., R.D.

I love this amazing program, and I look forward to learning about the work each of you has done in service to your peers and your community as Teen HEAL interns. These last two and a half years, since San Francisco and the whole world were hit with the COVID-19 global pandemic, have changed so many things about our day-to-day lives. Those of you who participated in Teen HEAL this past year are an embodi - ment of resilience and commitment to the health of the community, regardless of the challenges we all are facing. I also value this program and Catherine Wong's vision because it spotlights nutrition and the importance of healthy eating in the overall health of a community. Moreover, through its focus on youth, this program shifts power and agency to young people who can be positive agents of change when it comes to a family or community's healthy habits. Teen HEAL is an innovative program where young people gain knowledge, experience, and leadership skills to be applied during their internship to help address the problems of obesity, diabetes, and limited physical activity among teens in our community. Thank you for participating as an intern in this innovative and impactful program, and thank you to Catherine for bringing your vision to fruition. I also love the connection of this youth-focused program to Chinatown Public Health Center. China - town has been a leader in community-responsive health care for decades, and has hosted many programs which are aimed at promotion of healthy living habits and prevention of common health problems. Teen HEAL fits right into that public health tradition, and I hope that one by-product of the program is that interns get a little exposure to the work we do in public health. As someone who's now worked in public health for almost three decades, I am inspired each day by the commitment of the doctors, nurses, nutritionists, pharmacists, and medical assistants who serve San Franciscans each day. We would welcome any of you to join us in this work whose mission is to improve the lives and well-being of all San Franciscans. Congratulations again on your graduation, and best of luck in your future endeavors. I wish you all the best of luck and good health. Hali Hammer Hali Hammer, M.D. Director of Ambulatory Care San Francisco Health Network SF Department of Public Health6Inspiring words by Sunny Pak M.D., M.P .H. Dear Teen HEAL Interns, Congratulations on completing the Teen HEAL program, graduating interns! I am so proud to see how far you have come in applying the new skills and knowledge to your everyday life - from improving personal habits to creating healthier versions of your favorite recipes. Being able to modify recipes yourselves with a purpose is a great achievement! Throughout this past year, you have brought better health to your friends by establishing Teen HEAL clubs in your schools, conducting Zoom club meetings, and reaching out to children and seniors in the community. That is simply phenomenal! Despite COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, Catherine and her assistants have continued to do an amazing job in developing this program to be both educational and interactive for teens and youth. Conducting the internship through Zoom meetings and promoting the program through KTSF have allowed teens and young adults from anywhere in the world to learn more about creating a healthy lifestyle. Inviting different guest speakers to teach in the program has broadened the curriculum beyond western nutrition. I hope the lectures in cardiology and cancer from an integrative medical perspective, looking through western and traditional Chinese medical lenses, instilled in us the importance of maintaining homeostasis and balance in health. The nutritional knowledge and cooking skills learned from this program will undoubtedly help to achieve that balance. I look forward to seeing how the Teen HEAL program will evolve in the future, and how the interns in the program will continue to inspire others in their community to lead healthier lives. Best Wishes, Sunny Pak Sunny Pak, M.D., M.P .H. Associate Medical Director On Lok 7Inspiring words by Kristin Wong M.D. & Esther Situ R.D.N., M.B.A., C.D.E. Congratulations to the Teen HEAL interns and mentors of 2022! Thank you to Catherine Wong, R.D. for creating and directing this program. Her dedication and efforts are unwavering. I commend the students for completing the program and everyone for making this project even more successful than last year. Teen HEAL comes at an opportune time when we've emerged from the pandemic, and aside from a multitude of setbacks, we've also seen an increase in the rates of obesity in both adolescents and adults. From a medical perspective, I observe these changes on a daily basis as patients have returned to the office 10-20 lbs heavier than the last years. It is concerning as Asians tend to have complications from ex - cess weight, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and fatty liver at an earlier stage in their weight gain compared to their Caucasian counterparts. So it's especially important that Asians main - tain healthy habits to prevent these medical conditions. The good news about the increased rate of obesity is that the tools learned throughout the program can reverse those changes. Learning and implementing these healthy habits are daily decisions we make that may seem mundane or restricting. Choices such as skipping out on that boba, avoiding that extra serving of noodles, or choosing to shut off the computer and get outside to exercise are small, daily choices that have a long-lasting positive impact on our health when viewed over decades. It's fantastic to hear that not only are interns learning about nutrition but are also implementing daily changes, experimenting with foods, and sharing knowledge within the community. It's tremendous that in - terns are returning year after year to build on their knowledge, mentor new interns, and pursue careers in nutrition.In a time during the pandemic where social distancing translated to social isolation, this program has helped interns establish connections across the city and blossom into leaders. It is outstanding to have clubs at 6 high schools, college students mentoring interns, and Zoom meetings impacting hundreds of people in the community. This program has given you a great foundation in nutrition, hopefully a new network of friends and colleagues, and many tools to guide you in the right direction on the path of health. I encourage you to continue to make healthy choices, grow and share your knowledge of nutrition, and implement healthy choices with your family. In this way, we can all contribute to our family and communities living long and healthy lives. Again, congratulations on graduating from this wonderful program. On behalf of the doctors and staff at CCHCA, I wish you all great success in your future endeavors. Kristin Wong Kristin Wong, M.D. CCHCA Grant Chair AAMG & CCHCA Physician Esther Situ Esther Situ, R.D.N., M.B.A., C.D.E. Health Education ManagerGrant Manager, CCHCA8Dear Teen HEAL Interns, We wanted to take the time to acknowledge all your hard work and commitment you have put into the Teen HEAL Program. Tak - ing the initiative to further your learning and enrichment journey speaks volumes to the kinds of amazing things you can accom - plish. With the mix of hard work, grit, and conviction you have learned along the way, I hope you come to understand that you are unstoppable. How I know you can be unstoppable is through your unwaver - ing commitment to this program. We've met in the virtual setting, monthly on Saturdays to review aspects of leadership and self-improvement. Not to mention the over 40 hours you've logged in virtually throughout the week for the rigor of school. You must recognize that this dedication is special, and to take that charac - teristic wherever you go. Throughout the endurance of the global pandemic, your lives have continued to change. You've developed new routines; you tread slower from precautions and the emotional toll was im - mense at times; you missed friends, felt anger from parental mis - communications, and even felt lonely at times. You pushed on. Afterall, you are unstoppable. When the vaccine was available to you, you got it, and the relief that came with it. You began to emerge again. Slowly, carefully, and cautiously felt free. Did you emerge with more insight? More compassion as the threat of life became upfront and present? More willing to share who you are and how to care?I believe you did. I see hope because the promise of a better future is evident in the allyship you have formed in your Teen HEAL community, in the way you are surrounded by caring adults, in the grit you have shown to prepare yourself for the uncertainty of tomorrow, and in the way you are kind to one another. This is the community you have created and through this community, please realize that you also hold the ability to mold and shape others because you are unstoppable. Good luck and be kind, Your Friends at the Chinatown YMCA Denise Hung Denise Hung Camp and Teen Director Andy Chu Andy Chu Associate Executive Director Inspiring words by Denise Hung & Andy Chu 9 Inspiring words by Vivian Wong R.D. Dear Teen HEAL Interns, You have all done a tremendous job the past year in the Teen HEAL internship program to improve your eating habits and inspire others to make healthier lifestyle choices. Throughout the internship, we have covered many nutrition topics, specifically focusing on eight major nutrition skills. Starting from the basics, we learned about building a healthy plate and choosing healthier options from each food group. From there we learned about reading food labels in order to make smarter shopping choices. I was specifically amazed during our food label reading activity when you found foods from home to identify healthy choices. I hope that you continue to use this skill in your daily lives and also teach your friends and families. As we progressed through the internship, we began talking more about weight management, which is a very important topic these days, especially since most of us continue to stay at home for a pro - longed time with the pandemic. This makes it harder for us to exercise and to stay away from unnecessary snacking. Just remember the three R's that we talked about for healthy snacking\u2014 reduce (size and frequency of snacking), replace (unhealthy snacks with healthier alternatives) and refuse (to snack out of boredom), which we have ex - plored with recipes that we prepared through the internship. I love the healthy snack recipes that you shared during our training because not only did you choose healthy ingredients, but you also picked creative ingredient combinations that inspired me! We have also talked about making healthy dining options when eat - ing out, focusing on the 80-20 rule by only eating 80% of your meal whenever you dine out. We explored nutrition topics beyond the ba - sics: organic food, vegetarianism, stress and nutrition. You may find yourself more easily stressed during the pandemic, which is why it is important to maintain good sleeping and eating habits. Talking with friends and meditating can also help you relax your mind and body. Besides healthy eating, we talked about the importance of staying active with different types of exercise. With the rapidly changing pan - demic of COVID-19, I hope that you can find creative ways to achieve 60 minutes of physical activity every day. You can follow online exer - cise videos, or try having a video conference with friends where you meet virtually to exercise at home to make it more fun. I am impressed by all the healthy recipes you have created for this yearbook and hope you have been taking the pandemic as an oppor - tunity to cook more at home and experiment with new recipes. I am happy to see that the program has helped many of you become better health advocates and build a closer bond with your family and friends. I hope that you will keep these skills in mind in your future endeavors. Best wishes, Vivian Wong Vivian Wong, R.D. Out-patient Nutritionist In-patient Clinical DietitianSan Francisco Department of Public Health 10HEAL Leadership Team 2021-2022 With a much larger incoming class of new interns, the Teen HEAL Leadership Team of 2021-2022 welcomed six more members (Amanda Hu, April Ng, Kassandra Yeung, Cathy Yixi Ou, Celine Fong, Megan Chen) in addition to the returning team (Erika Tam, Tiffany Tse, Meiyan Huang, Nicole Read, Juliana Chen). In doing so, we've also man - aged to increase diversity by including high school and college students together in the process of planning and implementing the HEAL trainings. The main differences between 2021-2022 and the last two years were the events the HEAL Leadership team coor - dinated. To start off the new school year, four college in - terns from the leadership team hosted the HEAL College Applications Workshop, part one of the two-part college 101 series, which was directed to the high school senior interns and open to the general public. With experiences ranging from current college freshmen who had just gone through the college application process and a college se - nior preparing for graduation, the workshop was able to successfully impart to attendees the knowledge of the general breakdown of the different components and final tips the panelists wished they knew beforehand. To end off the school year, the leadership team also hosted the HEAL Transition to College Workshop, the following part to the college 101 series, where three of our college interns discussed ways to better adjust to college life. Compared to previous years, where Catherine would invite professionals from various career fields to present their life journeys, we sought speakers who had more applicable stories to share. Though our selection of speakers came from our very own leadership team members (both high school and college interns), we were nonetheless able to learn more about one another and realize our shared struggles in finding our identities and thriving in school. Besides such learning opportunities, the leadership team most notably encouraged more bonding between interns. Throughout the year, the HEAL Leadership Team has been dedicated to allothing time at the start of every training for playing fun games to get to know each other, such as \"Never Have I Ever\" and \"Two Truths One Lie.\" In particu - lar, the leadership team hosted the most competitive game yet\u2014Nutrition Jeopardy, HEAL version. Despite COVID-19 cases pushing the HEAL internship to be virtual, we were, fortunately, able to meet together for a HEAL Christmas party celebration at the Chinatown Public Health Center. With many fun events planned out, ranging from wrapping dumplings to a few rounds of the game \"Taboo,\" many in - terns were finally able to see each other in person for the very first time, and a few intern alumni were also able to join the group too! Moving onwards, the HEAL Leadership Team hopes to cor - dially celebrate our graduating interns and welcome new ones who will be joining in the behind the scenes planning of the HEAL Internship Program. With an expected smaller class size, we also hope to enhance our current mentor system to facilitate stronger bonds between mentors and mentees with common interests and more individualized support to help interns get the most out of the program. Though many of our interns will be leaving to pursue their own life journeys, we hope that the past year has been memorable and informative for everyone and that they will continue to spread their new-found nutrition knowledge to wherever they are headed towards!

Sunday morning breakfast!\" Every Sunday morning, I would wake up to the sound of my father calling me from downstairs to get his renowned Sunday morning breakfast, accompanied by the sound of clanking plates and utensils. My father had done some dietary research and was now trying a new recipe. This re - search produced a dish with white rice, half of it covered with tilapia and the other half covered with corn, all topped with some salt. I always took it for granted. I assumed that it would be provided for me every Sun - day morning, and I never thanked him for it. I didn't understand how he managed to create a perfectly balanced dish, which he would present to me every Sunday morning with a beaming smile on his face. I was ungrateful, and I regret it tremendously. I managed to be selfish and blind at the same time. This series of seemingly nonchalant encoun - ters with my father and lessons presented to me through Teen HEAL has taught me a valuable lesson in gratitude and humility. I have come to be more grateful for every little thing, including a Sunday morning meal. Teen HEAL has taught me the importance of a balanced diet and the difficulty of creating one. I was blind to the amount of effort my father had put into this dish, only realizing it years later. Now, due to the efforts of Teen HEAL, I can proudly recreate this dish and many other dishes as well. I have made great strides in my culinary knowledge, which I apply to my everyday life, not only in cooking, but also in meditation, exercise, and stretching. I have adopted a healthier lifestyle and created worthwhile habits that will stick with me for the rest of my life.

However, I was fortunate to have continued my third year as a HEAL intern, which gave me a familiar community to fall back on every time I was feeling lost and homesick. Throughout this past year, I mainly served as a member of the leadership team, with an additional role as the leader of the evaluation team. Though still an unfamiliar task to me, I've learned to designate tasks to other evaluation team members and compile each intern's reflection into succinct slides for further re-evaluation by the whole team. Contrary to what those who knew me in high school would expect, myself included, I fell out of my passion for running. Joining the Cornell Running Club every afternoon after classes just didn't seem appealing, especially when I was already struggling to survive in my dorm room with two fans on simultaneously in the humid 80-degree weather. My main form of exercise was from my Ashtanga Yoga class every Friday, and the 17,000 steps from walking to classes around campus, or the occasional at-home bodyweight YouTube workout video, which was significantly less compared to my average week as a high schooler. As a result, the dreaded freshman weight gain was inevitable. Though Cornell Dining is ranked relatively high for best campus food in the country, my food choice options were very different from my typical dinners, a home-cooked meal by my mom using the skills I've learned in HEAL to make it healthier. My general preference for food has always been the Chinese cuisine, but every college meal I had felt like I was eating takeout from the amount of oil used in cooking that left vegetables gleaming under the lights. There wasn't much that could be done in this situation, so I typically aimed to make oatmeal in the dorms given my limited resources. Instead of adding the typical brown sugar topping, I used Juliana Chen Cornell Universitya banana or other fresh fruits as my natural sweetener; sometimes I even used plain yogurt. It has also been much easier to imple - ment the MyPlate guidelines with an actual plate instead of a bowl. I always choose to include more vegetables from a variety of colors and alternate between meat and a plant-based protein source. Like - wise, I always end meals with my favorite yogurt and fruit combina - tions with the occasional coconut shreds, which I've come to learn is a Whoa food from Skill 5! Through trial and error, I have also been able to find new habits that suit my current college student lifestyle. Since I am more sedentary now in comparison to high school, I've also found that snacks were not as necessary anymore. As we've learned from Skill 3, \"Reduce, Replace, Refuse,\" it has aided me in noticing my general eating and hunger patterns. I've in turn focused on meeting my daily nutritional needs through three meals a day, which are typically breakfast, a relatively early lunch, and dinner. When eating with friends, I also aimed to remind them to include more variety of vegetables on their plates. And, if the weather isn't too crazy in Ithaca, I'll also drag my friends along to walk to and from classes instead of taking the bus, which usually earns me a few unwilling glares! In addition to eating a healthy plate, I have recently been making more of an ef - fort to workout, which can range from a 10-minute ab workout to a spontaneous 4-mile run, to regain some of my lost muscle strength and take time out of my day to focus on myself, while giving my eyes a break from screens. I still have ways to go in improving my current lifestyle, but with each day, I hope to reintegrate ex - ercise and continue fueling my body with nourishing foods as an indispensable part of my daily routine and inspire my peers to do the same as well! 15 Shakshuka INGREDIENTS 1 Tbsp olive oil \u00bd medium 1 tsp paprika \u00bd tsp cumin\u00bd of a 28 oz tomatoes3 eggsSalt and pepper (to taste)Rosemary (optional)Basil and thyme (optional) INSTRUCTIONS 1.

Juliana Chen Avocado Pesto Pasta \u00bc cup nutritional yeast \u00bc cup chopped walnuts Juice of 1 lemon Salt and pepper (to taste)17My name is Kaitlyn Chen. I am a junior at Galileo High School. I used to not pay attention to my diet, but since being a Teen HEAL intern, I've real - ized the long-term importance of eating healthy and incorporating nutrient dense foods in my meals. During my time at Teen HEAL, I have learned many nutrition skills: building a healthy plate, managing weight, shopping smart, making healthy snacks, and many more. I am incorporating these new skills into my diet by paying more attention to the nutrition facts and ingredients when I am shopping for groceries, following the MyPlate Guidelines by including fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy in every one of my meals, and looking for healthy alternatives of food instead of empty calorie foods. In Teen HEAL, I also learned many other skills like communication, public speaking, and stress management, which has helped me build my con - fidence. In addition, I got to learn about different types of diets, Chinese medicine, Yijin, and the life journeys of different people, which I found very interesting. The parts I enjoyed most about Teen HEAL were the food demos and the college workshop because I got to learn how to make bento, turnip cake, popovers, tofu mochi balls, and many more foods. The food demos showed me how to make the food, step-by-step. The college workshop was very helpful because it began to prepare me for applying to college. It has been a joy being a Teen HEAL intern and learning how to live a healthier lifestyle and promote it to my community.

I learned about public speaking, communication, and creating a safe space from Denise. Those are very important everyday skills that I have improved. Additionally, hearing about the life journeys of others gave me the confidence to pursue my passions and not give up when I encounter a mishap. The food demonstrations also gave me inspiration on what simple healthy foods I could make. My favorite is the tofu mochi balls that Amanda showed us because it's simple and unique. This program has taught me many ways to live healthily and active - ly. Even though most of the program was conducted over Zoom, I got the chance to meet many new people. I am happy to have gotten this experience and will continue educating myself and others on Healthy Eating Active Living. My name is Makayleh Chen, and I will be a senior at Encinal Jr & Sr High School in the fall 2022-2023 school year. What I learned about most during HEAL was the importance of having a healthy and balanced diet. I applied the skills, \"Build - ing a Healthy Plate,\" \"Shopping Smart,\" and \"Making a Healthy Snack\" when I shop for food and cook. When cooking, I try to decrease the amount of sugar or saturated/trans fats in my in - gredients and replace them with healthier alternatives so that the meal is healthier overall. I shared the skills that I have learned in this program with my family and friends in hopes that they will also try to live a healthier lifestyle. As a result, my friends have started bringing healthier snacks for lunch. Instead of the usual chips and cookies, they began to bring fruits and whole wheat crackers. The skill \"Managing Your Weight\" was the most impactful for me. In today's society, weight is often a harmful or controversial topic. Most social media platforms portray the ideal body type as be - ing very skinny, which can lead to eating disorders. For most of my life, I have been underweight, and only recently have I finally reached and maintained a healthy weight. This skill has been very helpful for me because I learned that weight has many fac - tors that contribute to its increase and decrease. Fad diets are another topic I learned about that could be harmful to the body. New dieting methods are always circling the internet, but rarely do people research enough about them before trying it out. Learning this skill has helped me recognize and avoid unhealthy diets and habits, as well as manage my own weight better.

I used to be someone who didn't worry about their health much, but during quarantine, I realized that I have un - healthy eating habits and a relatively inactive lifestyle. I want - ed to do something to change and improve my eating habits. That's when I learned about Teen HEAL through a friend and KTSF. I believed that Teen HEAL was a good place to start. In the Teen HEAL program, I learned several nutritional skills: building a healthy plate, shopping smart, managing weight, making healthy snacks, and many more. I incorporated the MyPlate guidelines consisting of fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy into every one of my meals. Additionally, I would pay more attention to the nutrition facts and the ingre - dients in the products I'm buying by looking at the grams of fats, sugars, calories, minerals, fibers, the daily value percent - age, and also the ingredients. I would also manage my weight by limiting the number of junk foods and sugary foods in my diet. Instead, I would look for more healthy alter - natives, such as replacing regular chips with fruit chips. As I learned about these skills, I would slowly try to incorporate them into my life.Megan Chen Galileo High SchoolIn addition, I learned about other skills: public speak - ing, stress management, communication, and leadership. These skills helped me become more confident. Learning these skills also helped me understand that many people often feel stressed and scared to open up just as I did. By understanding this, I was able to be more confident and create a safer space for others to open up. I also learned how to cope with stress. With these new skills, I hope to continue building my confidence. Furthermore, I also learned Yijin, Chinese medicine, differ - ent types of diets, and the life journeys of different people along with healthy recipes like bento, turnip cake, popovers, tofu mochi balls, and many more foods. Lastly, since the research topic for my partner and me was the health risk of processed foods, I also learned about what processed foods are and how they are a health risk to us, which I found to be very interesting. Through Teen HEAL I learned a lot about how to eat healthy and what being healthy looks like. The things I learned in Teen HEAL are very informative and useful, but also very different because I wouldn't be able to learn about these skills specifically at school. I think it is a great community and it allowed me to get to know the other Teen HEAL in - terns better. Teen HEAL was definitely a good place to start learning about health. 22 INGREDIENTS 1 egg A pinch of salt1 tsp oil 1 cup cooked brown rice1 Tbsp rice vinegar 1 sheet nori seaweed \u00bd cup cucumber, matchstick\u00bc cup carrot, shredded\u00bc of an avocado INSTRUCTIONS 1.

Egg Sushi Roll Megan mins Servings: 323When I first heard of Teen HEAL through my brother, it seemed so complicated and confusing. I was given access to one of the training sessions before I joined, which made me really curious to learn more about the program, but I was still unfamiliar with the concept of healthy eating. However, throughout the past year,I've actually found the train - ings to be really easy to understand. Healthy eating is pretty simple. I use the chart about the proportions of what I should eat every day as well as the limits of what's recommended when making my meals. I even shared the \"building a healthy plate\" guidelines with some of my friends. They were open-minded and willingly adopted the guidelines, especially after hearing about how healthier meals could improve sleep and decrease stress. When I first tried to adopt a healthier and more active lifestyle, I was slow to act on it. Over time, I was more motivated to change when I learned about the risks of unhealthy eating such as cancer, long-term stress, and lower sleep quality. I recall one time when I asked myself if reaching for the fruit popsicle after dinner was worth it. It was too much sugar, and I had a better replacement for it anyways. I would have eaten the popsicle and thought nothing of it earlier on in this goal of eating healthier, but now I know that I shouldn't. I could combine some fruit, yogurt, and granola to make a yogurt parfait which I love. It is such a simple recipe and could be altered and changed easily. Gradually, that mindset of eating healthier slowly changed my hab - its. I still occasionally will choose a popsicle over an Victorin Chen Lowell High School apple, but I'm trying to eliminate that. Exercising is still a prob - lem though, but I have made some efforts to try to increase my daily movement. I started small with only running a few laps around my house every day, but I stepped it up over time with the energy I was getting from eating healthier. I've been trying out new exercises while still keeping my goals in mind. I learned that it doesn't have to be a routine set in stone and that it's ok to try out new exercises or new activities. It could be martial arts or just taking a hike. It depends on what you want. I've been enjoying my time as a Teen HEAL intern. Everyone is nice, supportive, and inclusive. I remember when I was at the Christmas party, I was still a bit confused about how Teen HEAL worked at the time, but Catherine and the other interns were very welcoming. Learning to make new food as well as getting to try new food was very fun. The welcoming event for all interns was also fun too. I got to see Martin Yan cook in person and was introduced to everyone in the program. I've been having a really good time at Teen HEAL, and I hope that I can continue to keep improving my eat - ing and exercising habits to achieve a lifestyle I'm proud of. 24 Trout with Smoked Garlic SauceINGREDIENTS 1 lb rainbow trout, gutted and scaled 3 cloves smoked garlic1 tsp olive oil \u00bd tsp salt\u00bd tsp ground black 1 tsp white wine vinegar INSTRUCTIONS Trout: 1.

I began by checking the nutrition facts when I visited grocery stores. Understanding the ingredients within the foods I consumed helped me make healthier choices. Before join - ing HEAL, I often bought groceries without checking the nutrition facts, which was an issue because it could result in a poor diet. I made sure to share this with my family. Checking the nutrition facts is now a necessity for my family when we go grocery shopping. For instance, we choose to eat healthier snacks such as dried fruits, nuts, sweet potatoes, and whole-grain crackers. We also con - sume low-fat dairy products like low-fat milk and low-fat yogurt. In our daily meals, we utilize MyPlate to portion the amount of food we consume. An - other skill that I applied to my life and my family is the \"go slow whoa\" foods. I suggested to my family that we incorporate more go foods into our meals. That includes foods like fruits and vegetables without preservatives or added sugars. My family loves to consume red meat, but we became more aware of our consumption amounts after recognizing that red meat falls below the slow category. My favorite food demo recipe that I have tried is the popovers by Catherine. It was simple, yet delicious. I added straw - berries and honeycomb inside, which made a fabulous dessert. Thank you Catherine for introducing this recipe to us! 27 Prep Time: 10 mins Servings: 1 INGREDIENTS 1 1 egg 1 Tbsp cilantro 1 Tbsp green onion2 Tbsps onion 1 clove garlicINSTRUCTIONS 1.

Bibimbap Kristin Chiu Prep Time: 15 mins Cook Time: 15 mins Servings: 129 My name is Samantha Chiu. I am currently a sophomore at San Francisco State University majoring in Diet and Nutritional Science. I am interested in this major because I want to become a registered dietician in the future. During my free time, I like to cook and test out different recipes. A recipe I made recently was japchae. It's colorful, nutritious, and tasty too. As an intern at HEAL, I learned about different skills to maintain a healthier lifestyle. The skill Building a Healthy Plate gave me a better idea about the proportions of food I should be consuming from each category. Besides having a healthy diet, I learned the importance of incorporating at least an hour of exercise per day to maintain a healthy weight and body. I further developed my passion for cooking and trying many new foods through HEAL this year. When I go to the grocery store to shop for food, I read the nutrition labels carefully to see if it contains anything that might be high in fat, salt, and sugar. In my recipes, I try to replace ingredients that contain high amounts of fat, salt, and sug - ar with healthier alternatives. By replacing ingredients with healthier alternatives, I can still consume delicious food that is healthier and more nutrient-dense. Samantha Chiu San Francisco State University With the skills I learned from attending this program, I got the chance to serve the community by hosting a Zoom meeting to educate my friends and family members about nutrition. In my Zoom meeting, participants get to engage in fun games like Ka - hoots where they get the chance to be more engaged in learning about nutrition. Starting this year, I also had the opportunity to build up my leadership skills by joining the Nutrition Club at my school where I participated in team activities like helping out at the school greenhouse. This was a way to encourage people to adapt to a healthier lifestyle and also create a happier, healthier community. A takeaway I learned from life journey speaker Timothy Lam is to never give up when life gets difficult. Also, don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it. I found that it is fine to not know everything. By asking for help, it creates a learning opportunity for me. 30 INGREDIENTS Korean Glass Noodles Prep Time: 3 dried shiitake mushrooms, soaked in hot water until soft, cut into thin strips 2 Tbsps mushroom water 2 bunches glass noodles 2 carrots, shredded1/3 zucchini, peeled, cut into \u00bc inch wide strips 1/3 white onion, sliced 1/2 jalape\u00f1o, cut into \u00bc inch rings1 tsp honey 1 tsp brown sugar 2 tsps reduced sodium soy sauce1 tsp sesame oil 1 tsp hot pepper paste A pinch of salt & white pepper3 cloves garlic Spinach Ingredients:2 bunches spinach 1 clove garlic, mincedA pinch of white pepper 1 tsp sesame oil 1 tsp reduced sodium soy sauce Egg Ingredients:2 eggs, beaten 1 tsp Japanese cooking wine A pinch of pepper 1 tsp reduced sodium soy sauce INSTRUCTIONS Shiitake Mushrooms: Rinse and soak the dried shiitake mushrooms for 20-30 mins or until softened in hot boiling water.

Serve. 31 My name is Celine Fong, and I will be graduating from George Washington High School this year. I will be majoring in Biochemistry this fall, and I aspire to utilize my education as a stepping stone to incorporate nutrition and metabolism in my future work. In my leisure time, I enjoy cooking, doing pilates, watching Korean dramas, calling my sister via Face - time, and taking walks with my parents. HEAL has truly taught me to step out of my comfort zone. From the start of the program, Catherine, our internship di - rector, and returning interns repeatedly encouraged me to take the initiative to restart HEAL Club at Washington, invite friends and relatives to attend Zoom community workshops, and serve as the HEAL secretary this year. As a school club lead, I learned to actively promote HEAL through Instagram and flyers. Furthermore, I learned to stand unafraid as I con - ducted food demonstrations and taught my peers various nu - tritional skills, such as how to Build a Healthy Plate. Although there were times when barely anyone attended my club meetings at school, my mentors in the internship motivated me to persevere to make HEAL known at Washington. While the HEAL Club at Washington has not been as successful as I envisioned it would be, this internship has shed light on other ways I can be a more outspoken advocate for healthy eating. For instance, I have learned to teach my parents and friends to make healthy eating a part of their lives. Through my continuous efforts, I have noticed my mom exhibit grad - ual changes in her lifestyle habits; she has come to enjoy kale, use nutritional yeast in her cooking for an extra boost of Vitamin B-12, fuel her body with more protein, reduce her intake of refined carbohydrates and red meat, and engage in strength-training exercises. Celine Fong George Washington High School As this year's Class Secretary, I am responsible for sending out training emails, taking attendance at training sessions, and cor - responding with individuals who attend our public Zoom sympo - siums. While being punctual and time-efficient worked to my ad - vantage, the position of Class Secretary allowed me to discover my tendency to make careless mistakes. Thus, HEAL has also taught me to complete every task thoroughly. Aside from the nutrition knowledge I have acquired from partici - pating in HEAL, I really enjoyed listening to Life Journey Speak - ers share their own struggles and triumphs, especially from fel - low interns who are in a similar stage of life as I am. I particularly related to Erika and Kassandra, who mentioned the pressure of living up to the expectations of others, the difficulty of maintain - ing a proper balance between school and extracurricular activi - ties, and the mindset of seeing the college process as simply a means of growth and not something to be bottled down by. I also loved watching Amanda's food demon - strations and trying new recipes on my own (Meiyan's Oatmeal Cookies were perfectly chewy and delicious)! While it would have been nice to attend trainings in person and to meet other interns face to face, I definitely appreciate the time we spent together at HEAL and am grateful that I was given the opportunity to share methods of healthy eat - ing and active living with those around me. 32INGREDIENTS Stir-Fry Kale: 1 large bunch curly kale \u00bc cup nutritional yeast\u00bd tsp salt Olive oil 8 oz. dry matcha or regular soba noodles (4 bundles or 1 pack) \u00bd pack frozen edamame beans1 block extra firm tofu Olive oil 5-7 radishes, sliced Black sesame seeds and chopped green onions for garnish Sesame Soba Noodles (Vegan) INSTRUCTIONS 1.

High Protein Chocolate Mousse Prep Time: 10-15 mins Servings : 3 Celine Fong34My name is Amanda Hu. I am currently a freshman majoring in Food Science at UC Davis and an alum of Lowell High School, class of 2021. As implied by my major, I love food, including cook - ing, baking, and eating. I usually cook on the weekends and love to make cakes for my friends and family on special occasions or whenever I crave it. I am also very interested in Japanese culture, originating from my hobbies of reading manga, listening to j-pop, and playing Japanese rhythm games. Reading manga about cooking also strengthened my interest in food. I joined HEAL to learn more about the nutrition side of food and to build my leadership skills. Coming into the program, I had a general idea of what is healthy and what isn't: we should eat more fruits and vegetables and avoid added sugar and too much sodium. I usually had balanced meals, but I struggled with getting enough dairy into my diet be - cause I am lactose intolerant and don't really like the taste of Amanda Hu UC Davismilk. After attending the monthly trainings, I now have ad - opted the advice to eat yogurt for dairy. I also drink oat milk that is fortified with calcium and vitamin D as an alternative to dairy milk. I live a very sedentary lifestyle as a college student, but with the encouragement and exposure to new exercise types during Zoom trainings, I have been walking more and even tried Yijin and the patting exercise. As a part of the leadership team and evaluation team, I de - veloped my leadership skills over the course of this program. I attended the weekly leadership team meetings where I helped make decisions and plan activities, served as a men - tor for a high school HEAL club lead, and helped organize the evaluations of the program's activities. An experience that developed my organizational and public speaking skills was the food demonstrations I presented during trainings. I had to plan my presentations ahead of time, which consisted of deciding on a dish to make, preparing the ingredients, and thinking about how I would use my laptop and phone to properly capture what I am doing. So far, I made tofu mochi balls, an apple cake, and a character bento (Japanese boxed lunch) to share some healthy recipes that the HEAL com - munity can try. As the end of my first year in this internship approaches, I gained a wealth of important knowledge and leadership skills that I want to continue sharing with my community. 35Prep Time: 10 mins Cook Time: 15 mins Servings: 4 pieces of toast INGREDIENTS 4 slices whole wheat bread \u00bd cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt 1 large egg 2 tsps honey, a little more to drizzle if desiredToppings: Sliced fruit, cocoa nibs, sliced almonds, etc INSTRUCTIONS 1.

Enjoy! 38 My name is Meiyan, and I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a major in Nutritional Sci - ence - Physiology and Metabolism. In the summer, I will be taking EMT training courses in order to obtain an EMT certification. I enjoy spending time alone, playing video games, as well as meeting and learning from people. This is my second year in the internship. In addition to attending bi-monthly training with other interns, I was given more leadership tasks and responsibilities. I was on the leadership team and mentored four other high school interns. On the leadership team, I engaged in weekly meetings and participated in discussions that structured future training. We brainstormed various new projects to add to this year's internship program, such as the research project, which allowed interns to interact with interns from other high schools and practice their public speaking skills taught by Denise. Another leadership responsibility that I was given was being a mentor of Mission High School and Galileo High School HEAL clubs. As a mentor, I actively checked in with my mentees monthly on their internship and school club status and provided helpful insight when needed. I was also deeply involved with community engagement and outreach. In this internship, I have given six presentations, impacting different age groups and communities: Self Help for the Elderly, Asian Women Resource Center, Chinatown YMCA, and Mei Lun Yuen. This year, I taught Build My Plate and Limit Added Sugar presentations to children at YMCA, recognizing the need for children to be mindful of hid - den sugars and nutritious meals. I also gave a presentation on Healthy Eating to over 50 seniors in Mei Lun Yuen Apartments, a senior housing facility, emphasizing the importance of certain nutrients that boost our immune system during COVID-19. Besides giving presentations to different groups, I also went on KTSF and Skylink TV programs to promote basic nutrition knowledge to the general audience alongside Catherine, our nutrition manager. Another wonderful opportunity I had was to represent the HEAL program and report our progress to the program funder, the Chinese Community Health Care Association. This year's experience as a second-year intern was extremely valuable and definitely a highlight of my four-year college experience. Although I learned more nutritional information in school, I was not given an opportunity to apply my knowledge in real life. Next year, I will continue as a third-year intern and hope to bring more interesting projects to enrich our internship experience.

Whether it is learning how to build a healthy plate or how to manage my weight, each of the skills that we learned together in trainings helped expand my knowledge about healthy eating and active living. For example, we learned how much of the different food groups would be considered healthy per day, based on the MyPlate guidelines; half of the plate is recommended to be fruits and vegetables, a fourth of the plate is lean proteins, and the other fourth of the plate is grains. I used this knowledge to start building healthier plates for myself and my family by suggesting more or less of each food group to buy for the next meal. I found the weight management skill to be the most informative and interest - ing because I have been underweight all my life. We learned what causes weight loss and weight gain, that weight loss occurs when more energy is put out than in, and that weight gain occurs when more energy is put in rather than out. We learned the impact of calo - ries on our diets and different alternatives we can choose to con - sume to control the energy we are putting in. For example, drinking Kyle Lieu SOTA (Ruth Asawa San Francisco School of the Arts) water instead of soda or using smaller plates or bowls to reduce por - tion sizes (though not very applicable to me since I am trying to gain weight). These skills that I have learned not only played a role in my own well-being but also in those around me as I have become more conscious of the flaws in my family and my previous eating habits, physical activity, and flaws. We have had more balanced meals and have made stronger efforts to get some physical activity in each day since joining HEAL. Although the whole internship was done on Zoom, I found the experience to be very positive and educational. The food demos were a very fun learning experience; they sparked motivation in me to go to the kitchen and try out those recipes or even new ones. I also enjoyed the bonding we were able to have with other interns as we were able to learn a lot from each other. As this internship comes to a close, I hope to retain all the information learned so that I can pass it on to those around me and inspire them to live a healthier and therefore, happier life just like how this internship impacted mine. 41 INGREDIENTS 1 cup pistachios \u00bd cup ground almonds 1 cup oats \u00bc cup avocado oil\u00bc cup honey1 egg INSTRUCTIONS 1.

As a leader, I try to be a good listener and to be welcoming to others so that they feel com - fortable speaking their thoughts. As a teammate, I try to ensure that everyone participates and contributes their part to the group. These are lifelong leadership and communication skills that I will carry with me through the rest of university and onwards. Furthermore, HEAL allowed me to learn more healthy recipes and cooking techniques. My favorite food demo was when Amanda made the tofu mochi balls. I thought it was a really easy, yet delicious food that could be added to multiple different types of meals. Overall, I en - joyed all the food demos by Martin Yan, Amanda, Catherine, etc. They were the best part of the train - ings. Lastly, my most memorable experience at HEAL was the Christmas party. Be - ing across the country at Penn, I know I've missed out on many opportunities to meet and work with the rest of the interns. The Christmas party was the first time I was able to meet some of you guys, and it was so fun! Over Zoom trainings and lead - ership meetings, it's definitely much harder to make friends or talk to everyone. Being able to see some of you in person and to wrap dumplings, eat, and get to know each other will remain a special memory in my heart. I'm glad that I was able to get that experience from HEAL. Overall, HEAL was a won - derful internship that allowed me to meet more people, im - prove my leadership skills, and to make myself and those around me healthier. My name is April Ng, and I am a sophomore at the University of Penn - sylvania. During my time at HEAL, I learned what it truly meant to eat healthier and live healthier. Before the pandemic hit, my family and I would eat out quite often at our favorite restaurants. Through HEAL, I learned more about the importance of cooking at home. I enjoy the process of cooking and seeing what ingredients I am putting into my body. My family and I rarely eat out nowadays as we prefer to try new recipes and make our own meals at home. I'm grateful that HEAL changed this aspect of our lives because we are working harder to become the healthiest versions of ourselves. Some skills I found exceptionally valuable include building a healthy plate and reading nu - trition labels. I realized that most of my meals usually lacked whole grains and dairy. After learning about what a healthy plate consists of, I began to incorporate more grains and dairy into my meals. I also passed this lesson on to my family, convincing them to build healthier plates at home. Similarly, after learning how to understand the nutrition label better, my family and I became more aware of the added sugars, sodium levels, and saturated fats present in the food we buy. These are essential nutritional skills that I will continue to use daily and will also share with those around me. Furthermore, HEAL has inspired my family and me to exercise more. At college, I've always found it really difficult to start going to the gym because I didn't want to appear as if I've never been to the gym be - fore (which I haven't). Luckily, I had some friends who knew their way around the gym and would go with me until I felt comfortable enough to workout on my own. I began to go to the gym whenever I could outside of studying and classes. This summer, I plan to go to the gym every day after work. Overall, my family and I were able to change our diets to healthier home-cooked meals and exercise more. Besides improving my physical health, being a part of the leadership and evaluation team in HEAL also taught me many leadership and communication skills. I loved whenever Denise, Catherine, Vivian, or Dr. Sunny Pak would share their knowledge and experiences with us.

Because of my parents, I know how to play more than 5 different kinds of sports including table tennis, badminton, basketball, swimming, and volleyball. I especially enjoy volleyball. I played volleyball for the first time when I was 13 years old. It quickly became one of my favorite hobbies, which led me to join the high school volleyball team. Besides sports, I also like to draw, read, and test out different recipes. There are rarely any foods I dislike, but some foods I do not like include avocados and fizzy drinks. Although I don't like Coke, I am a big fan of milk tea. My cooking journey began in elementary school when my parents weren't home during summer vacations. I quickly discovered that cooking and baking were really fun, and they became additions to my hobbies. Watching the cake puff up in the oven makes me feel relaxed. After my first year in the Teen HEAL program, I decided to stay an - other year because I think the Teen HEAL program really taught me a lot and gave me many memorable experiences. I was pleased to be invited by Catherine to join the Leadership team. We meet every Monday to discuss the specific agenda and icebreakers to prepare for Saturday's training. The members of the Leadership team are very thoughtful, and I have learned a lot by listening to their opinions. Dur - ing the leadership meetings, I improved my communication skills and developed a deeper connection to the Teen HEAL program. With Catherine's mentorship, we were encouraged to set up our own high school HEAL clubs to share what we learned about healthy eating and exercising. It further gave me a chance to build my leadership. My club has been running for 2 years ever since. I am happy that HEAL gave me the opportunity to impact others in a way that allowed them to have a healthier lifestyle. One example is when one of my club members replaced milk Cathy Yixi Ou Mission High Schoolwith soy milk because she is lactose intolerant, and she started to pay attention to the sugar content of the drinks when she bought them. My family also started a healthier eating diet. We would match our dinners to a healthy plate and make sure we were getting enough vegetables and fruits. One of my favorite food demos was the ginger milk pudding. It's easier than I thought, and the one I made tasted familiar, exactly like the ones I ate in restaurants when I was a kid. The Teen HEAL program has given me a deeper understanding of nutrition, and the two years of experience and lessons I gained as a Teen HEAL intern will without a doubt, remain an important part of my life. I started making more conscious choices about food and cooking methods that helped my family and I become healthier overall. In ad - dition to acquiring more nutritional knowledge, I was also able to make new friends through this program. Furthermore, I found it very useful as a high school student when we had individuals from different fields share their life experiences and the life lessons they learned along the way. I am very glad that I chose to join this big family two years ago. I have experienced many things for the first time through this program, such as becoming an MC and establishing a high school club. I was able to practice my public speaking skills, and teamwork skills, and these experiences have overall made me a better person. I look forward to having more people join the Teen HEAL program to learn more about nutrition and to improve their lifestyles. 47 INGREDIENTS 2 bananas 1 \u00bc cups instant oats\u00bd cup 1% milk\u00be cup eggs tsps sugar Blueberry Oatmeal Egg Tart Cathy Yixi Ou INSTRUCTIONS 1.

Through this program, I have learned a range of skills, from how to choose snacks to how to manage stress. I am eternally grateful for this opportunity; these skills are something I hope to carry with me for the rest of my life. A skill I appreci - ate getting to learn about is breaking foods into three categories: slow, go, and whoa. A lot of diets and health advice given online include avoiding this, buying this, eating this, don't eat this, and throw this away immediately. Oh, wait! Never mind, this actually has health benefits! The slow, go, and whoa method has been extremely helpful. It has helped my family choose foods, and helped assist the decision-making process. During this decision-making process, foods are divided into three categories, separated by their nutritional value and how much we can eat before it harms us. This approach allows someone like me, who is easily flustered when it comes to decisions, to make a healthier decision by following a guideline. If a food ends up in the whoa category, it is not blacklisted. It is given a tiny yellow sign with an exclamation mark. Food that ends up in the slow category is okay to eat at some point but would prefer you choose a healthier option. This approach is good because it helps people develop a healthy relationship with food. It teaches us that food is your friend. It has its quirks and benefits. While I have learned many nutrition-based skills from HEAL, I have also learned im - portant skills regarding self-care. A presentation I take inspiration from is De - nise's \"How to Manage Stress.\" As a constantly stressed person, I appreciate the opportunity to understand the causes of stress better and how to manage it. After all, if you treat your body well, it will treat you well in return.

For most of my life, I wasn't concerned with eating a healthy diet and didn't necessarily have a form of exercise that I enjoyed. As I transitioned from high school to college, it was even more difficult to find the time and motivation to prioritize my physical health. However, through exploring different recipes and forms of exercise, largely inspired by everything I have learned in the Teen HEAL internship, I have made many lifestyle changes to prioritize my health and well-being. From the Teen HEAL program, I learned how to build a healthy plate, read food labels, and make healthy snacks, among many other nutrition skills. Through these lessons, I have learned to plan my meals to ensure that I am meeting the proper portion guidelines, care - fully read nutrition labels before purchasing food products, and substitute unhealthy snacks for more nutritious alternatives. Since joining the program, my diet has primarily consisted of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and vegetarian protein sources such as tofu and tempeh. Additionally, the program has imparted to me the importance of physical activity as I now regularly practice yoga and go on daily walks. Since this is my third year as a Teen HEAL intern and I am a college student, I was given the opportunity to take on more of a leadership role. Specifically, I was able to lead presentations and communicate about upcoming assignments; additionally, I was able to be a mentor to a group of other interns. Through these responsibilities and presentations from Denise Hung and other life journey speakers, I have been able to strengthen my leadership skills. For example, I have developed my public speaking skills and am now much more comfortable speaking up in class. Additionally, developing my communication skills has enabled me to have a greater impact on the health of my family and friends because I have been able to teach them the importance of a well-balanced diet and an active lifestyle. I am very grateful for the knowledge and skills I have gained through my years as a Teen HEAL intern, and I know that I will carry the impacts of this program and its supportive community with me throughout my life.

Add the couscous, crushed bouillon cube, and boiling water to a large bowl. Mix and cover with saran wrap or cloth. 2. Chop the veggies, olives and feta into bite-sized pieces. Add minced herbs (basil, mint, parsley) if desired. 3. Remove the saran wrap or cloth from the large bowl and use a fork to fluff the couscous. 4. Add and mix in the veggies, feta, herbs, lentils and pesto to the large bowl with couscous. 53Despite being a second-year HEAL intern this year, I still learned a lot. What I enjoy about HEAL is that not only do we highlight useful nutrition skills with helpful acronyms, like \"Whoa, Slow, and Go\" foods, but we also focus on managing mental health. For example, some of my favorite training sessions include the monthly visits by Denise from the Chinatown YMCA. Covering topics such as creat - ing safe spaces and handling stress taught me valuable lessons that I can also apply to my life beyond the kitchen. I was also a leader at Lick Wilmerding's HEAL club for the first time. This was a new and challenging experience to balance with my other extracurriculars, but I enjoyed it. We met alongside the APIDA-Students-in Alliance (ASIA) group at Lick. This was great to see the community come together, bond over food, and see different food interests. For example, we had a meeting where we taught about MSG and its history and racial implications. We had fruitful discussions about our family's experiences with MSG and the different connotations that may have been skewed from West - ern diet interpretations. It was nice to see the conjunction of both social and cultural impacts of food, which was inspired by HEAL. Erika Tam Lick Wilmerding High School The skills that I have used and implemented the most are the Clean Fifteen and Dirty Dozen list for produce. Although it is a bit hard to remember all of them, I always pull out the list before purchasing fruit or vegetables to make sure if I need to buy them organic or not. At a recent family dim sum gathering, the topic of organic produce arose. This provided a perfect opportunity for me to talk about this list and my family and relatives engaged enthusi - astically. I believe such conversations made them reconsider their past grocery purchases and will affect their future grocery shop - ping as well. All in all, HEAL has given me the gift of community connection. With a whole new class of interns this year, I was able to meet many fellow students who shared a common interest in healthy food. Also, we were able to work through our busy schedules and still remain so supportive and engaged with each other during the trainings. HEAL was a consistent growing opportunity for me this year, es - pecially as a senior with my high school years coming to an end. It was nice to have so many fond memories of new projects, working through challenges, and new discoveries. 54 INGREDIENTS For the salad: 1 small head of raw cauliflower / 3 cups 12 Brussels sprouts 1 small head broccoli / 2 cups 2 cups radicchio 2 cups green cabbage 2 cups kale\u00bc cup sunflower seeds\u00bc cup dried mango, chopped\u00bc cup crispy toasted quinoa or \"crunch\" factor of choice (can re place with al - monds, crushed toasted bread, seeds, etc) 1 small bunch cilantro2-3 stalks green onions (scallions) Cruciferous Salad with Zesty size Erika TamThis salad combines a fun cruciferous base with just a hint of spice and a touch of sweetness to round out the flavor.

I spend much of my free time watching both Korean and Chinese dramas. One of my personal favorites would be The Untamed. I also enjoy reading novels and listening to music. I joined Teen HEAL because I was interested in learning how to lead a better lifestyle. During the internship, I met many people and learned a lot of new skills. Some skills I learned during my internship include managing stress, how to read food labels, and how much nutrition our body needs. I've always had trouble trying to get stress not to affect me that much. Ever since Denise taught us about managing our stress, I tried ad - justing my mentality to think the way Denise taught us. I would try to find the root of the stress and work it out from there. Before, I often coped with stress by trying to find the best way to get things done the quickest, which of course, didn't always work out. After adjusting my mentality, I was seeing results within a week already. I could feel myself becoming happier and less tired at school. I had a lot less trouble sleeping as well. Reading food labels and understanding the amount of nutrition my body needed really helped me when I was shopping for groceries. I developed the habit of always reading the food labels and checking if it had too much salt, sugar, or saturated fat. Groceries with a really high amount of the daily recommended value were seldomly bought. Instead, I chose or now choose healthier options like Greek yogurt in - stead of sour cream. My mom, being an immigrant from China, didn't understand how food labels worked. I taught her how to read them and influenced her to make a habit of reading food labels as well. Since then, our groceries have always been healthier.Jenny Tse Lowell High School We also learned about the pros and cons of many diets. One of the really well-known ones, the Carnivore diet, consists of eating a lot of meat which would mean taking in a lot of saturated fats. This could result in high cholesterol. Another well-known diet would be the Keto diet. This diet is high in fat and protein, but very low in carbs. This raised my awareness and knowledge of the diets that everyone claims to be beneficial. Throughout my experience as a Teen HEAL intern, I enjoyed the bond - ing activities the most. Although our training sessions were all through Zoom, every intern made it enjoyable. There were fun bonding ac - tivities such as continuing each other's sentences with fortunately or unfortunately. Another one I really enjoyed was when we played Never Have I Ever. Everyone was nonjudgmental and inclusive toward each other. I especially enjoyed school club meetings because it was in per - son. We were able to talk face to face, which made it more fun and engaging. Although we were often learning various nutritional topics, the atmosphere was always light-hearted and filled with laughter. Teen HEAL was able to teach me skills that allowed me to have a healthier lifestyle. Teen HEAL made me cook healthier, and make bet - ter food choices. It was very educational, but also fun. I learned a lot of new skills and a lot about myself. I am very grateful that I was given a chance to become an intern here be - cause without it, I wouldn't know where the current me would be. 57 INGREDIENTS (for 14 dumplings): \u00bd cup minced ground pork \u00be cup cabbage, shredded10 shrimps (optional and can add more depending on prefer - ence) \u00bd tsp salt 14 dumpling wrapsScallions (optional)Fat free reduced sodium chicken broth (or other broths) INSTRUCTIONS 1.

Whether it is trying out new recipes or new ways of presenting information, she has taught me to never be afraid of the unknown because only when there is the unknown, will there be the excitement of discovery. From every single person that has contrib - uted to Teen HEAL in any way, shape, or form, I have learned love. It is because of the love and compassion of every single person that has made Teen HEAL into what is today that I'm standing here today. All the guest speakers, doctors, parents, and friends that have supported me over the many years have made me the person that I am today and I couldn't have been more thankful for all of them. \" \" Last year, I also included a quote in my champion story, \" \" and now, I will end my Teen HEAL journey with another quote. The quote that I wrote in my first year as a Teen HEAL intern translates to \"a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step\" which I find to be quite fit - ting because I started my journey as a Teen HEAL intern on a complete whim. Through - out my Teen HEAL internship, I've learned to express courage, leadership, initiative, com - radery, and self-discovery among many other things. As I leave the Teen HEAL community, I want to leave this quote, \" \" It takes ten years to cultivate wood, and a hundred years to cultivate a man. As a Teen HEAL intern, I've learned many things, but as life will teach you when it comes to learning things, the sky's the limit. Even after I graduate, I will con - tinue to be curious and I will continue to strive because if anything, Teen HEAL has taught me to keep learning. My time at Teen HEAL has been a crazy journey that I'm so glad to have embarked on. Two years have passed since I first applied to be a Teen HEAL intern, and I couldn't be more proud of the person I have become and the things that I have accom - plished. I have spoken as a life journey speaker, been a guest teacher at the YMCA, and a co-host of our very own Teen HEAL graduation among many other things. The relationships I have built with my fellow interns and my mentors will be something that I treasure no matter how far down the road I travel. Along my Teen HEAL journey, I have made many friends, acquired many memories, and learned many lessons. When I first became the Lowell HEAL club president, I was ex - cited but also a bit nervous to meet and interact with the new in - terns. It turns out that I was worried for nothing. Over the course of a year, Lowell HEAL interns and club members built strong friendships with each other, whether it was fighting over who wants to give the next meeting's presentation or what game to play. I am extremely grateful and proud to have seen how much Lowell HEAL has grown in the span of a year and it couldn't have been done without the help of all the interns at Teen HEAL and for that, I will always be grateful. I'm grateful to have had the op - portunity to teach and guide all the new Lowell HEAL interns, but I'm even more thankful for everything they have taught me: lead - ership, friendship, and creativity. To all the Teen HEAL interns, it has been an honor to serve you all on the leadership team and as one of your life journey speakers. I'm so grateful to have seen everyone grow as a leader in the community, and I look forward to seeing how you will make your mark in the world. Not only have I seen others grow and change throughout this internship program, but I have also grown and changed. The les - sons I have learned from different mentors will always be deeply ingrained into my personality and future. First, I have learned to lead. Since Denise is always pushing and motivating us interns to take charge amongst our peers, I have successfully mentored and led the class of 2022 Teen HEAL interns.

Some examples would be learning how to read nutrition la - bels, shop wisely, pick a healthy snack, and lose weight in a healthy way. Nutrition labels allowed me to know how much nutritional contents are in the foods that I eat. It is something that I used to disregard when grocery shopping. I used to con - sistently drink milk tea and eat red meat, especially beef, but after I learned that too much sugar and saturated fat in our diet (even though it is non-sugar milk tea) can contribute to chronic diseases, I have changed to a healthier diet. I try to substitute beef with seafood or chicken breast to meet the protein require - ments for my health. My favorite food recipe from the appetite book is poached chicken. My father and grandparents used to cook chicken like this, making me nostalgic. It is a healthier option for protein compared to red meats, and it can be served in many different ways like in a salad or in a wrap. Likewise, substituting snacks like cookies for whole wheat crackers is a better choice. Staying active is also a skill that I found useful in this internship. Balancing energy in and out over time is the key to managing our weight, so exercise is essential. Not exercising enough can also contribute to chronic diseases like diabetes and even mental health problems. All these skills that I learned from this internship are linked together, which makes it even more important for us to live a healthy lifestyle overall. It is also never too late to start eating healthier. Serena Wu Mission High SchoolThroughout the internship, I was able to teach and share these healthy eating skills with people around me at school and at home. Teaching these skills offered me opportunities to practice my public speaking and communication skills. It feels good to make a positive impact on those around me, which is also a reason why I like this internship. By teaching peers and contributing to the community, I have learned that I need to listen to others' feedback and comments. This also taught me to be a more patient teacher. Overall, some leadership skills that I learned from this internship are pub - lic speaking, how to manage time, making a plan for studying (very useful in college), how to manage mental health, and more. I tend to be an introverted person and don't particularly like asking questions when I face challenges, but after I attended the HEAL workshops, I know that I need to voice my thoughts and speak up. It is the only way to get help whenever I need it, which is something that I changed and I think it is very important for my future college life. My favorite part of this internship is the life journey speakers throughout the year. They consist of athletes, old interns, and many interesting people. I love hearing people with different backgrounds and different professional fields share their stories and advice for applying to colleges or even hearing about their lifestyles while they are in college. I can resonate with some of them when we have the same experience, hobbies, or even just a sub - ject that we like in common. Overall, Teen HEAL has taught me so much and I have made so many good memories here. It has really improved my diet and made me become a more extro - verted person. I am thankful to all the people who have helped me in this internship. 62 INGREDIENTS 1 lb shrimp 1 tsp spiced salt1 Tbsp cooking wine Spiced Salt Shrimp Serena Wu INSTRUCTIONS 1.

Prep name is Kassandra, and I am going to be a rising senior this year at St. Ignatius College Preparatory. I am a second-year HEAL intern and I am also on the leadership team! Dur - ing my two years at Teen HEAL, I have learned important nutritional information that I apply to my daily life and habits. In my free time, I enjoy baking, crocheting, and gardening. As an intern in Teen HEAL, I participate in the weekly leader - ship meetings as well as the Zoom trainings on Saturdays. A skill that I found extremely beneficial was the go, slow, and woah food groups where different foods are placed in one of those groups based on how often we should eat them. Go foods are foods that we should eat more, while woah foods should be reduced. I also enjoyed learning about reading food labels again as it was important to have a refresher. I am able to apply this skill while buying breakfast and snack items at the grocery store. This way, I can choose the health - iest options that have less sugar, sodium, and saturated fats. My favorite parts of Teen HEAL were the food demos as well as the cooking assignments that we did this year. I was mes - merized by Amanda's bento box as well as her other healthy baked goods because they looked so tasty! When I bake nowadays, I utilize the skills I've learned from HEAL to make my desserts healthier, yet still delicious, for my family's health. I also loved making the turnip cake during Chinese New Year. One of my favorite dishes during that holi - day is turnip cake, and I was glad to be able to learn how to make it more nutritious. In my HEAL school club at St. Ignatius called SI HEAL, we have taught and made many healthier Kassandra Yeung St. Ignatius College Prep dishes and desserts such as cereal bars, brownies, and spring rolls. Another part of Teen HEAL that has influenced me were the life journey speakers. I enjoyed listening to professionals from different career fields and my peers about their experiences and advice. My favorite life journey speaker this year was Michelle because I felt like she was able to connect with us and her jour - ney was so interesting! I especially enjoyed hearing about her study abroad experiences in Thailand, and it made me look forward to possibly doing a study abroad program in college. It was also difficult being the first intern to become a life journey speaker. However, I ended up enjoying sharing my life experiences, struggles and dreams with my fel - low interns. Being a life journey speaker was defi - nitely a highlight of my time at Teen HEAL. I have learned many life and nutrition lessons at Teen HEAL, which will undoubtedly help me navigate through life. In addition, I have made many friends from different schools this year through HEAL. Overall, I am thankful for how Teen HEAL has impacted my life. 65 INGREDIENTS 1 red apple \u00bd cup rolled oats 1 Tbsp vegetable oil1 Tbsp honey\u00bc tsp cinnamon INSTRUCTIONS 1.

In our club we have about 13 mem - bers including president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer. We had clubs every other Thursday which is about 2 meetings per month at lunch, so to - talling up to about 16 meetings. Within these meet - ings the skills: building a healthy plate, shopping smart, managing weight, making a healthy snack, sports nutrition and stress & nutrition were taught in this club. There were two food demos which were making parfaits and making rice paper rolls. Some challenges were starting this club because I have never started a club before so the process of start - ing a club was unknown to me. But eventually with some guidance from my friends I was able to suc - cessfully start my club. In addition, finding a spon - sor teacher for my clubs was also very challenging because many of the teachers didn't have their own classrooms or were sponsoring a club already. De - spite the challenges in the beginning the club was successful. Teen HEAL clubs in 6 HIGH Schools: Interns Megan Chen - Lead Kaitlyn Chen 97 Lick Wilmerding HEAL was founded this past school year, in the second semester. Despite the late start, we were able to meet as a group 4 times. During winter break, Theresa and I met over Zoom to discuss our plans, goals, and hopes for the meetings. We also got help from fellow HEAL Club leads in our internships, such as Celine and Cathy. Our first meeting covered Skills 1 and 2 and introduced members to our club and internship. Our Lunar New Year celebration was the biggest success, as we passed out packaged treats to celebrate the holiday. Everyone in our school could come and grab whichever treats they wanted. I also thoroughly enjoyed our All about MSG and \"unhealthy\" Chinese cuisine meeting, which we did in conjunction with our APIDA Students in Alliance Club (ASIA) at Lick. We last - ly ended our year with a reflective gratitude meeting sharing takeaways of the year. Our biggest challenge was actually coordinating our meet - ings and when to meet. Since our school has a designated club time and very strict rules on what our club could do while meeting there were lots of restrictions and barriers we had to deal with. However, overall it was a learning experience for Theresa and me to lead a club, coordinate meetings, and think about what attracts an audience. Lick Wilmerding HEAL Interns Erika Tam - Lead Theresa Pham98 Lowell HEAL has been through so many challenges in the past year. Everyone has been in the process of recovering from the pandemic when we were thrown back into the chaos of high school. However, I am so proud of how far Lowell HEAL has come since the beginning of the year and incredibly proud of the resilience that each and every member of Lowell HEAL has shown. We've established and grown our Lowell HEAL Instagram account, made a Linktree, and attracted Lowellites to attend our college workshop among so many other ac - complishments. The members of Lowell HEAL have grown so much over the past year. After many bonding games and presentations, everyone has become so much more confident in themselves and the relationships in which they have built with each other. They went from quietly listening to presentations to fighting with each other to give presentations. Playing bonding games with Lowell HEAL has become so enjoyable, and I am so glad that I got to know each and every one of you. Lessons we have taught over the year include Why Do We Care About Healthy Eating?, Eating Disorders, Go, Slow, Whoa, Staying Active, Managing Your Weight, Building A Healthy Plate, and Shopping Smart. We've reached so many members of our community through our healthy eating habits, and especially because of our college workshop that so many Lowellites have signed up for. We've had over 100 encounters, and we are nowhere near done. Thank you to each and every one of you who has supported Lowell HEAL because it's thanks to the efforts of everyone that our club has reached so many people of all different ages. Lowell HEAL Interns Tiffany Tse - Lead Amanda Chang (Sept-Dec 2021)Laura Chen (Sept-Dec 2021)Victorin ChenJenny Lead; Serena Ng After Mission High School's HEAL club ran for one year on Zoom, we were finally able to hold in-person meetings this year. However, a struggle we quickly encountered was recruiting new members in-person since our HEAL club meetings Occured during lunch time, but people were often busy then. In order to overcome this challenge, we decided to promote the HEAL club during the school club fair. We dedicated hours everyday to design school flyers, then posted them to social media and in the hallways. After lots of communication and efforts on our end, we began to see new faces join our meetings. In this school year, we held a total of 13 meetings, taught healthy plate skill, manage weight skill, shop smart skill and other skills. We also took care of the mental health of our members, and chose to play movies to help them relax during meetings around mid-term and final exams. In the teaching demonstration of healthy snacks skill, we asked members to share their favorite snacks and assigned home - work to check the daily nutrition recommendation table for snacks. Before each Monday's club meeting, HEAL club officers would get together to plan the agenda and main topics that will be taught. Each meeting followed this schedule: teaching and presenting a new nutri - tional skill, hosting a Kahoot quiz on the new knowledge, and some - times even food demonstrations. For instance, to end the semester strong, we organized a fruit yogurt food demonstration. The club members enjoyed the experience and the sponsoring teacher also expressed her appreciation towards our work. I'm glad that our club members learned essential nutritional skills from our club this year. Furthermore, through leading this group of wonderful club officers and club members, I was able to build up my own leadership skills. The experience of creating a club allowed me to practice my public speaking skills and my ability to develop deeper connections with others, connecting through our love for food and cooking. All in all, our goal is to spread nutritional knowledge, exercise techniques, and life advice that we learned from the HEAL club to our classmates and teachers. I hope that Mission High School's HEAL club will continue to gain more members throughout the years so we can keep spread - ing our message of healthy eating and active living. 100 SI HEAL was founded this year and in the beginning, we had to learn how to start a new club at Saint Ignatius College Prep. Michael and I started planning in August over Zoom and we spent countless hours brainstorming and getting to know each other to start our club. We struggled immensely, whether that was getting a moderator or figuring out a space to hold our club meetings, however, in the end, we managed to make it work. SI HEAL allowed me to develop more lead - ership skills because I dealt with talking to teachers and staff as well as leading the meetings. The first SI HEAL meeting went smoothly and it was a great start to the year. During our club fair, many people signed up to join our email list, however, roughly fifteen people showed up. This was a bit disappointing, but, it allowed us to figure out how we could lead meetings and delegate tasks. We made cereal bars to bond for our first meeting and it was difficult to find a recipe to do as many people had allergies. In the end, we figured out how to have smooth and engaging meetings. In the end, SI HEAL only had three official club meetings due to the busyness of my schedule. However, in those meet - ings, I was able to learn how to communicate with big groups and keep people on track. We were also able to teach class - mates about nutrition which is the main focus of SI HEAL. We taught about reading nutrition labels, building a healthy plate, and the go, slow , woah food groups. In total, about twenty people came to each of our meetings. St. Ignatius HEAL Interns Kassandra Yeung - Lead Michael Allen101 With the departure of Washington's previous HEAL school lead, I had to reestablish the HEAL Club at my school. As the only HEAL intern attending Washington High School this year, it was also difficult to recruit new members and gather interest for a club that few people seemed to know of. Even while promoting HEAL with Instagram posts and flyers on the school walls, only 1-2 members attended our meetings every month. As a result, we had only 23 encounters throughout the course of 8 meetings. Despite being few in number, the meetings we held at Washing - ton were fruitful as the small groups we had allowed for conver - sations to take place comfortably. During our club meetings, we learned about building a balanced plate and reading nutrition labels as well as explored the molecular science behind brain health and the Vegetarian Diet. Washington HEAL additionally held interactive cooking demonstrations, and members were able to make and take home their own food such as Oatmeal Cookies and Chia Pudding. Amongst all the practical lessons I took away from leading Washington HEAL, I discovered that the heart, thought, and intention behind each meeting mattered more than how many people attended in any given week. The members who were truly passionate about healthy eating and active living attended every meeting that they could, and that in itself demonstrated to me that every effort I made to impact those around me was worth it.

This team was created as an extension of the leadership team's responsibilities from 2020-2021 (Midpoint Evaluations, Year in Review) in addition to the new form of evaluation of HEAL Zoom clubs and trainings. After each meeting, the Evaluation Team posted the corresponding post-training or post-club evaluation form on google classroom, which were all collect - ed after a week. These forms gave the Evaluation Team an estimate of the interest level and helpfulness of the topics of our trainings, from the standard nutrition skills to food demos to leadership skills and many more. Finally, the Evaluation Team compiled all the data and created concise summaries of the interns' responses, which was further discussed with Catherine to make improvements to the program. To briefly summarize HEAL 2021-2022, we have included in the reflection yearbook select summaries of the midpoint evaluation, nutrition skills, leadership skills, food demos, life journey speakers, and Zoom clubs. One noticeable change that was made as a result of the feedback from the intern midpoint evaluation was including breaks in the middle of our three-hour trainings on Zoom. Not only were we able to make the meetings more engaging to the interns, but we also uti - lized the knowledge we've learned about the long-term dan - gers of being sedentary to promote small, quick fixes to bal - ance out the long periods of time spent in front of a screen. On January 8, we covered Skill 3: Building a Healthy Snack which scored an 8.4 out of 10 on an enjoyability and help - fulness scale. After this training, interns were familiar with the 3R's: Reduce, Replace, Refuse, and were also equipped with the tools needed to identify healthy snack options in the pantry. Additionally, the breakout room activity led by Amanda Hu gave the interns the chance to practice com - ing up with creative snack ideas and created a more relax - ing and comfortable environment for sharing with the small group size. At the end of January, HEAL held the Chinese New Year Symposium, which featured Martin Yan's \"Healthy Cooking Skills & Life Skills\" \"Patting Ex - ercise\" routine. For this Zoom club, there was an exceptional turnout, with 100+ attendees from a range of ages. Martin Yan was a favorite, and many attendees also appreciated that HEAL was keeping multicultural Asian traditions through our integration of Zoom clubs with personal diet preferences. In the following month on February 26, Denise Hung gave the interns a lesson on creating safe spaces, which scored an 8.8 out of 10 on an enjoyability and helpfulness scale. In this training, interns were able to reflect on factors that were important to themselves in creating a safe space, which was a place where one can feel both physically and emotionally comfortable. In particular, many interns found mentorship, balance, and support from friends and family to be essen - tial. To follow, we started with the first life journey speaker for 2022, Kassandra Yeung, which was a great start to the following series of speakers to follow from the HEAL Leader - ship Team. As a junior at St. Ignatius College Preparatory, a competitive high school, she shared many similar struggles of high school students of our generation, especially from parental and societal pressures. To conclude this training, Amanda Hu also did a food demo on the apple cake from the Healthy Appetite book, which was popular among the interns and averaged a 9.1 on the enjoyability and helpfulness scale. Throughout this first year of the evaluation team, we've ex - perimented with different ways in delegating work and ex - ecution in order to accomplish our final goals, which leaves us with much room to grow and improve. As HEAL 2021-2022 comes to an end, the HEAL Evaluation Team hopes to take the time to self-evaluate and present an even more organized team during HEAL 2022-2023, in order to make healthy eating and active living enjoyable for everyone our message reaches.
