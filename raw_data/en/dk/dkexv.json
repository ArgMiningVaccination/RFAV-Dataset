These treatments may help individuals avoid severe illness, hospitalization, and death. In March 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration launched a nationwide Test to Treat initiative, which aims to help people quickly access lifesaving treatments for COVID-19 at little to no cost. The Test to Treat initiative is available at thousands of locations nationwide, including pharmacy-based clinics, federally-funded health centers, long-term care facilities, and community-based sites. In May 2022, the program was expanded to include federally-supported [Test to Treat sites](/TestToTreat/Pages/fact-sheet-t2t-fed.aspx), which reach vulnerable communities. Test to Treat partners include some of the nation's largest pharmacy chains. To find a participating Test to Treat site near you: Call the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 hotline, which can provide information on the Test to Treat initiative.

The call center is open from 8AM to 8PM ET Monday through Friday and 8AM to 5PM ET Saturday and Sunday. Individuals can be tested, treated, and prescribed treatment for COVID-19 by their own health care providers (including telehealth) and other sites of care. First, patients are either tested on site or can bring in a positive test result from another testing site or an at-home test. Then, COVID-positive patients will meet with a qualified health care provider (either on site or through telehealth) who will determine whether the individual is eligible for the COVID treatment pills ( [Paxlovid](/COVID-19/Therapeutics/Products/Paxlovid/Pages/default.aspx) or [Lagevrio](/COVID-19/Therapeutics/Products/Lagevrio/Pages/default.aspx)). If an individual is eligible, they will receive a prescription and can have that prescription filled on site.
