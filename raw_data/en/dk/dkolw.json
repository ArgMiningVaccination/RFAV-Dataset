[time]as an [excipient]in [mRNA vaccines]against [SARS-CoV]- 2 containing PEG 2000, highlighting it as a potential cause of [anaphylaxis]. We aim to [report]clinical cases of severe [allergy]to PEG and furthermore to assess the usefulness of [skin tests](ST) performed with the commercial extract PEG 1500 for the [allergy] [work]-up of [patients]with suspected [allergy]to [SARS-CoV]- 2 [risk]of [allergy]to [SARS-CoV]- 2 [vaccination]referred to our [Allergy]Department from March to December 2021. ST were performed with extract PEG 1500 (Roxall), using the following methodology:prick tests with 0.1%, 1% and 10% concentrations, with readings at 30 minutes (according to manufacturer's instructions);if negative, [intradermal tests](IDT) were performed with the in cases of [anaphylaxis], where dilutions 1/1000 and 1/100 were used (adapted from previous [publication]using PEG 20000). Immediate IDT readings were made at 30 minutes and delayed readings at 24 hours. The same protocol was applied to 5 healthy controls [who]received PEGylated [vaccines]. Result(s) We present 2000 (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna). All [patients]had positive immediate IDT using PEG 1500 allowing the [diagnosis]and the selection of [vaccine]without PEG. All of them were negative to [polysorbate 80]. One [patient]developed [anaphylaxis]following IDT 0.01%. In the remaining 120 [patients], the ST using PEG 1500 were negative in immediate and delayed [reading]of IDT. Seven [patients]were positive to [polysorbate 80]. All healthy controls had negative ST using PEG 1500. Conclusion(s) To our [knowledge]this is the first case series describing the [allergy] [work]-up testing with commercial extract PEG 1500 in the scope of [SARS-CoV]- 2 [vaccination]. ST using extract PEG 1500 revealed to be a useful tool for the [diagnosis]of PEG [allergy], since it allowed confirming six cases of severe PEG [allergy], contraindicating the further [administration]of PEGylated [vaccines]. It also allowed [allergy]exclusion in one hundred cases that took afterwards [SARS-CoV]- 2 [vaccines]containing PEG 2000. Moreover, healthy controls had negative IDT demonstrating the reliability of the proposed [procedure]. Investigation should only be conducted in a specialized [drug ... LILACS LIS "}
