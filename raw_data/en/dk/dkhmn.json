Version 1.1 - January 1 3, 2022 (Revision History Log)Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 i Preface Within the past decade , Texas has experienced a signi ficant increase in population. This increase has led to more services being needed to meet the challenges of the expanding population, which in turn has led to the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC) engaging in more procurements and contracting opportunities. So, it follows, that proper procedures, policies, and guidelines must be in place to provide efficie ncy and proper oversight to the procurement and contracting process, while simultaneously protecting the taxpayer's dollar; therefore, it is imperative that the HHSC Procurement and Contracting Services division (PCS) create a handbook to address various issues in the procurement and contracting process. This HHS Procurement and Contract Management Handbook (Handbook) is designed to be a dynamic document; one that will evolve with legislative changes, best practices, and with feedback from program areas. As you read the Handbook and you find that minor changes need to be made, for example, typographical errors, please email PCS_DEC@hhsc.state.tx.us with those suggested changes. Minor, non-substantive changes will be made to the Handbook upon receipt. If any division wants PCS to consider an amendment to any provision of the Handbook, such recommendations should be submitted to PCS at PCS_D EC@hhsc.state.tx.us . All recommendations will be considered; however, the final content of the Handbook is subject to the approval of the Deputy Executive Commissioner of PCS and/or the Chief Operating Officer or HHS Executive Commissioner, if escalation is necessary. Further, in considering substantive amendments and/or recommendations to the Handbook that could affect process and/or procedural changes to HHS divisions other than PCS, PCS will seek stakeholder input prior to approving and implementing such amendments and will provide messaging of proposed changes throughout the process and at resolution, allowing sufficient time to plan for such change. More specifically, when substantive amendments and/or recommendations are submitted, within one week of receiving the proposed change, a member of PCS will contact the person who submitted the recommended change to gather more information. If, based on the information gathered, PCS determines that the proposed amendment or recommendation would benefit the Handbook, a member of the PCS team will arrange a meeting with identified stakeholders to review the proposed amendment or recommendation and review a draft of the proposed change. The identified stakeholders will then provide written feedback on the proposed change. The PCS member assigned to the change will review the written feedback and incorporate what is necessary to achieve the goal of the proposed recommendation. If necessary and pending the complexity and outcome of the proposed changes, PCS will also complete any research necessary with third -party agencies, consult with the Compliance and Quality Control division, the Office of Chief Counsel, HHS executive management, and complete any other due diligence necessary to support the recommendation. Thereafter, PCS will meet with the stakeholders one more time to ensure that the proposed change accurately reflects the goal and intended purpose of the amendment or recommendation. Once the amendment or recommendation is approved by the stakeholders, the amendment/recommendation will be submitted to the Deputy Executive Commissioner of PCS and/or the Chief Operating Officer or HHS Executive Commissioner for final approval. Once approved and properly messaged, the changes will be made to the Handbook and documented on the Revision History Log. PCS will complete a review of the entire Handbook biennially to reflect substantive amendments not previously made and to conform with laws enacted by the Texas State Legislature. It is the goal of PCS to make appropriate changes to the Handbook in a timely fashion so that the Handbook remains useful and relevant. Any questions concerning the Handbook should be sent to PCS_DEC@hhsc.state.tx.us .

PURPOSE The purpose of the Procurement and Contract Management Handbook (Handbook) is to establish consistent procurement and contract management policies and procedures that must be followed by the Health and Human Services (HHS ) System agencies : the Health and Human Services Commission (HHSC)1 and the Department of State Health Services (DSHS) .2 Additionally, HHSC provides procurement services to the Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS)3 and the Texas Civil Commitment Office (TCCO) .4 The Handbook aligns with the vision and governing principals defined in the Health and Human Services Procurement and Contracti ng System Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2020 -2023 . Additionally, this Handbook includes best practices to provide guidance for solicitations and managing HHS contracts. 1.1 The Three Lines of Defense Model Relating to Risk Each HHS agency shall have an internal structure to identify and mitigate procurement and contracting risks that align with the Three Lines of Defense Model (TLDM). TLDM is designed to provide clarity and coordination to specific roles and responsibilities for risk management. HHS agency Executive Management and the Procurement and Contracting Improvement Plan Executive Steering Committe e are responsible for setting objectives to manage risks and defining strategies to achieve them , as well as establishing governance structures and processes. Under the TLDM, staff will shar e information and coordinat e efforts across related customer organizations. 1.1.1 First Line of Defense The first line of defense is the day-to-day ownership of identifying risks and developing , implementing , and managing controls and risk management processes . These include , but are not limited to: a. Procurement Planning: Program, HHS Procurement and Contracting Services (PCS); b. Procurement Processing: Program, PCS; c. Evaluation: PCS; Program, PCS; f. Contract Management: Program , Contract Manager ; and g. Contract Close -out/Termination: Program, Contract Manager . 1.1.2 Second Line of Defense The second line of defense is to facilitate and monitor the implementation of effective risk management practices and to ensure they are operating as intended. It also provide s for a 1 Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 2155.144(j), Tex. Gov't and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 8 compliance function to monitor risks associated with applicable policies, procedures, regulations , and statutes. The second line of defense includes the following, grouped by HHS procurement and contracting phase : a. Procurement Planning: Program, PCS management, Budget ; b. Procurement Processing: Program, PCS management, CQC, System Contracting in the Office of Chief Counsel ; c. Evaluation: CQC, Program, PCS management ; d. Negotiation: Program, System Contracting ; e. Contract Formation: Program, PCS management, PCS Contract Management Support (CMS ), Budget , System Contracting ; f. Contract Management: Program, CMS ; and g. Contract Close -out/Termination: Program, CMS , Budget, System Contracting . 1.1.3 Third Line of Defense The third line of defense is performed by Internal Audit. Internal Audit provides review of processes to assess governance, risk management, and internal controls with an objective and disciplined approach. 1.2 Standards and Authority This Handbook provides a baseline for policies and procedures that support: a. Ethics and standards of conduct; b. Vendor interaction; c. Procurement methods; d. Procurement process; e. Solicitation advertisement; f. Respondent evaluation; g. Negotiations; h. Contract award and notice; i. Contracting activities through the contract lifecycle; j. Contract management; k. Grant performance oversight; escalation and reporting of contract performance issues; l. Contract termination and closeout; and m. HHS contract reporting requirements . HHS agencies can develop additional, consistent, contract management policies and procedures to best meet their organizational structure, program requirements, and business needs. HHS agencies must ensure their Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 9 respective rules, policies, and procedures do not conflict with the requirements in this Handbook . As a result of the Procurement and Contract Improvement Plan (PCIP) , HHS consolidated the HHS Procurement Manual and the HHS Contract Management Handbook into this Handbook to provide the HHS System standard procurement and contracting procedures, as did the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts with the State of Texas Procurement and Contract Management Guide , published by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts5 (Comptroller's Guide ). This Handbook has been established through the authority of the HHS Executive Commissioner and the Deputy Executive Commissioner of PCS. PCS administers the policies and develops processes and guidelines for implementing them . PCS will regularly update the Handbook as needed , to address changes in procurement and/or contracting laws, regulations, and policies. Additionally, PCS may incorporate changes due to audits, recommendations of state oversight agencies , and to incorporate evolving best practices. To receive notice of updates to the Handbook , subscribe to the GovDelivery Topic: \"HHS Contract Management Handbook Updates .\" Submit questions or recommendations about the materials or requirements in the Handbook to PCS at PCS_DEC@hhsc .state.tx.us . See Preface at the front of this Handbook for more information . This Handbook is intended to be used as HHS internal policies and procedures only. It does not create any rights or responsibilities for vendors or contractors, nor does it alter any HHS contract. If a rule, statute , or other legal authority conflicts with any portion of this Handbook , the rule, statute , or legal authority prevails to the extent of the conflict. In addition, although every attempt has been made to use the words and terms in the same context as they are used in the underlying statutory authority or rule, a word or term may have different meanings depending on the statutory context. This Handbook is intended to follow the rules, statutes , or other legal authorities that govern state procurement and contracting . In the event of a conflict, applicable law controls. 1.3 Applicability HHS C has express statutory authority to create and administer policies and rules related to the procurement and contracting duties of HHS and the administrative procurement functions provided to DFPS and TCCO. The Handbook has been developed as a resource for HHS agency staff on procurement and contracting processes. HHS PCS performs purchasing functions for multiple entities, including : a. HHSC ;6 b. DSHS ;7 c. DFPS ;8 and d. TCCO .9 2. INTRODUCTION The HHS System delivers services to Texans through a vast number of contracts expending a significant amount of public funds. HHS agencies must have authority to make desired purchases and, in many cases, must have delegated authority to make those purchases independently. Certain state agencies are vested with legislative authority to purchase 5 Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 2262.051 . 6 Safety Code \u00a7 12.0001 . 8 Tex. Hum. Res. Tex. Gov't and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 10 for the state (e.g., Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, Department of Information Resources, and Texas Facilities Commission). Such agencies sometimes delegate purchasing authority and other times delegation is provided by statute. Under Section 2155. 144 of the Texas Government Code , authority is delegated for purchases of certain goods or services acquired for the benefit or on behalf of clients for programs operated by the agency .10 In addition, HHS has delegated authority for certain construction procurements .11 State agencies have authority to contract only to the extent provided by law. Prior to initiating a procurement, staff must ensure that the agency has authority to procure the goods or services sought. All applicable state purchasing requirements must be followed. The purchasing process is driven by customer needs . The mechanics of the purchasing trans action are performed by the HHS PCS division. It is incumbent upon both program staff and PCS staff to be informed and mindful of the legal requirements of a purchasing transactio n. To the extent possible, HHS has adopted for its statutory purchasing delegation the same legal requirements and best practices that apply to any other state agency purchasing transaction. In addition, many HHS contracts present significant areas of business and service delivery risk to the HHS System and Texas. Effective procurement and contract management is a critical part of quality contracting. This helps to ensure that the state receives the best value . The CPA Statewide Procurement Division (SPD) is the central authority for state agency procurement guidance, education, and statewide contract development services. SPD established and published the Comptroller's Guide to provide state agencies guidance and a framework for the continued development of public procurement processes and best practices. State agencies are required by statute to comply with the Comptroller's Guide .12 SPD is also responsible for state -funded grant management and serves as the contact for state -administered, local government grant management related issues . SPD is responsible for uniform grant and contract management pursuant to Chapter 783 of the Texas Government Code. Each state agency is required to publish a contract management handbook13 that establish es contracting policies and practices that must be consistent with the Comptroller's Guide. This Handbook fulfills this requirement as well as HHSC's specific requirements to publish a contract management handbook and to coordinate the procurement practices of all HHS agencies .14 2.1 Procurement and Contracting Authority 2.1.1 Overview The Legislature delegates authority to state agencies. In some instances, the Legislature has directly delegated authority to HHSC. In other instances, authority is held by other agencies and may be further delegated to HHSC. 2.1.2 CPA Delegation by Rule15 SPD has delegated its purchasing authority to agencies for the following types of procurements (Appendix E - CPA Delegated Purchases Table ): a. One-time purchases of goods that do not exceed $50,000; b. Purchases of services that do not exceed $100,000; 10 Tex. Gov't Code 15 Comptroller's Guide, SPD Delegation by Rule. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 11 c. Direct publications; d. Purchases of perishable goods; e. Distributor purchases; f. Fuel , oil, and grease purchases; g. Internal repair purchases; and h. Emergency purchases. 2.1.3 CPA Delegation by Review For the non-delegated purchase of goods with an estima ted contract value of more than $50,000, the agency must submit its delegation request as an Open Market Request (OMR) to SPD. The purchaser is responsible for downloading the most current OMR form posted on the CPA website. The OMR with all applicable attachments must be submitted to open.ma rket@cpa.texas.gov . If the delegation request is denied, SPD will procure the goods on behalf of the agency. For procurements conducted under the CPA's procurement authority , purchasers request delegation of procurement authority for services procurements valued at $100,000 or greater. Delegation must be obtained before posting the solicitation and after the solicitation draft is complete and ready to post. The solicitation is uploaded to the CPA's Procurement Oversight and Delegation portal accessible through the Texas SmartBuy platform. CPA reviews the solicitation and provides recommendations through the portal. This is typically completed within 30 calendar days. After receiving notification that the recommendations are complete, the purchaser must accept or reject each recommendation within the portal based on information received from the procurement's internal stakeholders. Rejected recommendations must have a justification documented in the portal. Finally, stakeholders will work to incorporate accepted recommendations into the solicitation prior to posting to the Electronic State Business Daily ESBD ). 2.2 Ethics and Professional Standards All state employees are required to act in an ethical, impartial, transparent, and professional manner. HHS employees must uphold ethical values when carrying out their official duties and mus t adhere to the HHS Standards of Ethical Conduct as provided in the HHS Ethics Policy . It is the policy of the State of Texas that a state officer or state employee may not have a direct or indirect interest, including financial and other interests, or engage in a business transaction or professional activity, or incur an obligation of any nature that is in conflict with the proper discharge of the officer or employee's duties in the public interest.16 2.2.1 Statutory Prohibitions All HHS staff should be aware of statutory prohibitions related to ethics and standards of conduct , including , but not limited to, the following : a. Section 36.08 of the Texas Penal Code prohibits state employees from soliciting, accepting , or agreeing to accept any benefit from a person the employee knows is interested in or likely to become interested in any contract, purchase, payment, claim , or transaction involving the exercise of his discretion. 16 Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 572.001 . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 12 b. Section 572.069 of the Texas Government Code prohibits former state employees from accepting employment from a person or entity involved in a procurement or contract negotiation (even if the entity is not selected for the resulting contract) until at least two years after the contract was signed or the procurement terminated, if the employee participated on behalf of a state agency in a procurement or contract negotiation involving that person or entity. c. Section 2252.901 of the Texas Government Code prohibits state agencies from entering into an employment, professional services, or consulting services contract with a former or retired employee before the first anniversary of the last date on which the individual was employed by the agency if appropriated money will be used to make payments under the contract. d. Section 2155.004 of the Texas Government Code prohibits a state agency from accepting a bid or award ing a contract that includes proposed financial participation by a person who received compensation from the agency to participate in preparing the specifications or request for proposals on which the bid or contract is based. For example , a vendor who is compensated by the agency to participate in drafting the specifications or statement of work for a particular solicitation is not eligible to bid on the resulting solicitation and potential contract. 2.2.2 Employee Conflict of Interest and Standards of Conduct Additional information regarding employee conflict of interest and standards of conduct may be found in the Comptroller's Guide, the HHS Human Resources Policy Manual , the Human Resources Guidance Handbook , and the HHS Ethics Policy . All contract and procurement personnel must disclose any actual or potential conflict of interest and any situation that could create an appearance of impropriety. Such disclosure must be timely, complete and in compliance with agency procedures for notifying management of circumstances that could compromise the impartiality of the cont ract management and procurement process. See PCS Form 117, Health and Human Services Procurement -Specific Non -Disclosure and Conflict of Interest Certification and PCS Form 130 Health and Human Services Employee Non -Disclosure and Conflict of Interest Certification addressed further in Section 2.3. If a conflict of interest is identified at any point in the procurement or contract management process, HHS management with oversight over that point must take immediate action to ensure that management of any particular matter or contract does not benefit or create an appearance of a benefit to any employee or employee's family member.17 In accordance with the HHS Ethics Policy , all HHS agency staff have a duty to report any potential ethics or standard of conduct violations . Any HHS employee or contractor who has reasonable cause to believe that fraud, waste, or abuse has occurred must report the questioned activity to the HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG). See Circular 027. 2.2.3 Ethics and Conduct: HHS Procurement and Contracting Staff Public procurement professionals are gatekeepers for the proper expenditure of the government's limited financial resources. They are entrusted to uphold the highest ethical standards and be good stewards of public funds with every purchasing decision they make. Any erosion of public trust or hint of impropriety is detrimental to the integrity of the procurement and contracting process. All HHS staff involved in procurement and contracting must act in the best interest of the state and avoid any activity that could potentially impair their ability to carry out duties with independence and objectivity , or even give the appearance of impropriety. Failing to abide by these rules or to disclose a potential conflict of interest may result in dismissal and/or referral to law enforcement. 17 HHS Ethics Policy , page 20. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 13 a. HHS Staff Responsibilities All HHS staff must: a. Adhere to ethics requirements adopted in rule, ethics policies, and any code of ethics approved by the Executive Commissioner; and b. Disclose, in writing, any potential or actual conflict of interest concerning any contract or procurement in which they are or may become engaged.18 c. HHS Staff Prohibitions To avoid conflicts of interest, HHS staff must not: a. Participate in any work on a contract knowing that they, or a member of their immediate family, have an actual or potential financial interest in the contract, including, but not limited to, prospective employment; b. Solicit or accept a benefit from a vendor; c. Be employed by, or agree to work for a vendor; d. Disclose confidential information; or e. Be employed at a pay classification of B9, or higher, as determined by HHSC, if the employee's spouse is an officer, manager, or paid consultant of a Texas trade association or business that contracts with the HHS System.19 2.2.3.1 Vendor References and Endorsements To ensure fair dealings with all HHS vendors, HHS personnel may not endorse or provide a reference for any HHS individual vendor or a vendor's products or services. In response to such requests, HHS personnel who have been authorized by their supervisor to communicate publicly about the contract or procurement at issue may only provide factual information, such as that a vendor worked for the agency and the type of work that was performed . 2.3 Nondisclosure , Conflict of Interest, Nepotism Certification All HHS staff must disclose, in writing, any potential or actual conflict of interest concerning any contract or procurement in which they are or may become engaged. HHS PCS ensures compliance with legal requirements for procurement and contracting -related nondisclosure , conflict of interest,20 and nepotism21 certification s. The PCS Purchaser assigned to the procurement must ensure all purchasing personnel who participate in the procurement, including attorneys , complete the State Auditor's Office (SAO ) nepotism disclosure form before the agency may award a major contract (a contract that has a value of at least $1 million) for the purchase of goods or services to a business entity.22 Pursuant to Section 2262.004 of the Texas Government Code, \"'Purchasing personnel' means an employee of a state agency who makes decisions on behalf of the state agency or recommendations regarding: (A) contract terms or conditions on a major contract; (B) who is to be 18 1 TAC \u00a7 391.503(a), (b) . 19 1 and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 14 awarded a major contract; (C) preparation of a solicitation for a major contract; or (D) evaluation of a bid or proposal.\"23 2.3.1 Purchasing Personnel PCS Policy 403 In accordance with PCS Policy 403, Nondisclosure , Conflict of Interest, and Nepotism Certification, agency \"purchasing personnel\" that meet the statutory definition may include, but are not limited to, the following positions: a. Purchasers; b. Contract approvers; c. Evaluation committee members; d. CQC solicitation reviewers and financial analysts; e. Attorneys (SAO nepotism disclosure form only) ; f. Technical advisors; and g. Contract negotiators . 2.3.2 Required Documentation Procurement staff and other individuals involved in the procurement and contracting process may be required to complete the following forms: a. Health and Human Services Employee Non -Disclosure and Conflict of Interest Certification (PCS Form 130 ): HHS employees and HHS contract employees, as applicable, must complete PCS Form 130 no later than 30 days from their start date and at least once every fiscal year. A completed PCS Fo rm 130 is required before a person can participate in an HHS procurement, or in a procurement that HHS administers , or prior to accessing HHS's System of Contract Operation and Reporting (SCOR ). The only exception s are attorneys, evaluation committee members , and technical advisors who do not work for HHS PCS, HHS CQC, DFPS , or TCCO and do not access SCOR. b. Health and Human Services Procurement - Specific Non -Disclosure and Conflict of Interest Certification (PCS Form 117) : Evaluation committee members and technical advisors must complete PCS Form 117 for each procurement. c. State Auditor's Office Disclosure Statement for Purchasing Personnel (SAO Nepotism Disclosure Form ): Purchasing personnel must complete the SAO's Disclosure Statement for Purchasing Personnel for major contracts (with a value of at least $1 million ) for the purchase of goods or services from a business entity . A new SAO Nepotism Disclosure Form must be completed for each applicable procurement . 2.3.3 Disclosure of Actual or Potential Conflict a. If an evaluation committee member or technical advisor , purchasing personnel , or any person required to sign a PCS Form 130, PCS Form 117, or SAO Nepotism Form discloses an actual or potential conflict of interest or relationship with a business entity , or if one arises, they must immediately: 23 Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 2262.004(b) . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 15 i. Notify the PCS Purchaser assigned to the procurement ; and ii. If they are an HHS employee or contract ed staff , notify their manager. b. When notified of an actual or potential conflict of interest or relationship with a business entity, the PCS Purchaser assigned to the procurement must immediately notify their manager and deputy associate commissioner. The deputy associate commissioner must: i. Direct the purchaser or the purchaser's manager to request a determination from the HHS Ethics Office in writing; or ii. Direct an alternative to requesting a determination from the HHS Ethics Office in writing, such as assigning a different HHS employee or contracted employee to minimize disruption to the procurement schedule. 2.3.4 Completed Documentation The PCS Purchaser must place all required documentation for each evaluation commit tee member or technical advisor, purchasing personnel or any person required to sign a PCS Form 130, PCS Form 117, or Nepotism Disclosure Form in the official procurement file. The PCS Purchaser must also save in the official procurement file written documentation about any reported actual or potential conflict of interest and how it was resolved. HHS staff may get copies of completed PCS Form 130, PCS Form 117 and SAO Nepotism Forms by: a. Emailing PCS_Records_Ma nagement @hhsc.state.tx.us to request a copy ; or b. Finding the form in the completed forms library on the PCS SharePoint site. 3. VENDOR COMMUNICATIONS Communication between public procurement professionals and vendors is imperative and encouraged. If used effectively, communication with industry representatives is a vital resource for public procurement professionals. Steps must be taken, however, to maintain a fair opportunity to compete for all vendors and to avoid any appearance of favoritism. Agency personnel must be mindful that one-on-one communications with vendors occurring prior to contract award are subject to enhanced scrutiny due to the importance of maintaining a \"level playing field\" among all eligible vendors during competitive procurements. The HHS Vendor Interaction Policy must be followed, including requirements to consult with PCS, supervisor s, or the HHS Chief Ethics Officer for guidance . Contact personnel identified in the HHS Vendor Interaction Policy and, if and when necessary, consult with System Contracting .24 Each employee is expected to use their best judgment when interacting with vendor representatives. Employees should be familiar with their agency's Ethics Policy and the specific Ethics Policy for Contracting and Procurement Personnel to ensure that all training and disclo sure requirements related to ethics issues are up to date prior to meeting with any vendor representative. If at any point an employee is faced with an ethical dilemma that is not addressed in their agency 's ethics policies , the employee should immediately cease all communications with the vendor representative and consult with the agency's procurement office, their supervisor, or the HHS Chief Ethics Officer for guidance. For more information, review the HHS Vendor Interaction Policy . For any questions and/or assistance with vendor communications or facilitating a vendor meeting, please contact the Deputy Executive Commissioner of PCS at PCS_DEC@hhsc.state.tx.us . 24 HHS Vendor Interaction Policy; see also, Comptroller's Guide, Vendor Communication. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 16 4.

The term does not include the development of solicitations and contract awards that must be posted to the Electronic State Business Daily (ESBD)26 (found on the Texas SmartBuy website ) or in the Texas Register .27 Contract development applies to actions taken prior to contract execution, including the receipt and processing of requisitions, assessment of need, development and review of specifications, development and review of scopes of work, identification and selection of procurement methods, identification and preparation of evaluation criteria, preparation and advertising of solicitation documents, tabulation of respondent bids, evaluation of respondent proposals, negotiation of proposals, and the preparation and completion of contract award documents. The term does not include invoice or audit functions.28 4.1 Certified Texas Contract Developer (CTCD) An HHSC employee who is not already a Certified Texas Contract Developer (CTCD) or Certified Texas Procurement Manager (CTPM) through the CPA must be certified as a CTCD (formerly CTPM) to engage in contract development functions on behalf of HHSC if the employee develops, evaluates, negotiates, or awards a contract posted to the ESBD or in the Texas Register on behalf of a state agency.29 To become certified, the employee must take the Certified Texas Contract Developer Course through the CPA, achieve an 80 percent or higher on the Certified Texas Contract Developer exam, have completed payment for the course and examination, and apply for certification.30 New HHS C staff or staff that transfer to a position requiring a CTCD must obtain the required certification within the timeframe established by the hiring authority. 4.2 Certified Texas Contract Manager (CTCM) An HHS employee must be certified as a Certified Texas Contract Manager (CTCM) to engage in contract management functions on behalf of HHS if the employee has the job title of \"contract manager ,\" \"contract administration manager ,\" or \"contract technician ;\" performs contract management activities as 50% or more of their job activities; or manages any contract in excess of $10,000 ,000.31 HHS agencies must comply with the CPA requirement; however, an HHS employee must be certified as a CTCM if they manage any contract in excess of $1,000,000.

Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 17 4.3 Licensed Attorney A licensed attorney employed by an agency is not required to be certified CTCD or CTCM to perform the functions described above.32 4.4 Continuing Education and Certification Renewal Continuing education is required by the CPA to maintain certification , and all certifications are subject to mandatory renewal. For more information regarding these requirements, consult the Continuing Education and Certification Renewal page of the CPA's website. 4.5 Required Cybersecurity Training for HHS and Contracted Staff HHS information and information resources (IR) are valuable assets that must be protected from unauthorized disclosure, modification, use, or destruction. HHS must ensure information and resources are maintain ed with integrity and confiden tiality and that their availability is not compromised. Texas law imposes mandatory cybersecurity training requirements.33 HHS employees and contracted staff must complete the HHS Information Security/Cybersecurity Training within 30 days of hire or prior to accessing HHS IR, whichever is earliest.34 HHS employees and contracted staff must also complete the HHS Information Security/Cybersecurity Training as an annual requirement. HHS Employees and contracted staff must access HHS's System Training Solutions/iLEARN to complete the training.35 If an HHS employee or contracted staff is in a role that handles regulated or confidential data types with additional requirements (e.g. , employees who use federal tax information) or in an information technology (IT) role (e.g. , information owner or custodian) with a security requirement, additional role-based annual training (e.g., Safeguarding Internal Revenue Service Federal Tax Information) may be required. When an HHS employee or contracted staff leaves the agency, their supervisor is required to immediately terminate access to all HHS IR, in accordance with agency procedures. Failure to properly separate an employee or contracted staff from HHS IR, could result in the agency receiving costly fines or penalties for allowing unauthorized access to confidential data or systems. 5. PROCUREMENT AND CONTRACTING SERVICES DIVISION (PCS) PCS is the centralized office that handles procurement and contracting services for the HHS System. PCS partners with HHS staff, especially program staff and contract managers , and System Contracting , to provide procurement advice and forms, determine procurement methods, plan procurements, develop solicitation documents, manage procurement timelines, conduct vendor conferences, evaluate proposals, assist with negotiations when requested , and assist with award ing and execut ing contracts. Visit the Contracting with HHS web page for more information and resources. HHS staff should also refer to the PCS SharePoint site. The PCS vision is to ensure that stakeholders can successfully carry out their mission, maximize operational performance, and minimize risk through a collaborative and transparent procurement and contracting system that provides high quality, timely, and value -added services.36 The HHS procurement and contracting operating model is complex and composed of many customers, stakeholders, decision -making processes, activities, tools, and information systems interact ing with each other to improve the health, safety, and well-being of Texans while being good stewards of public resources. 32 34 TAC \u00a7 20.133(c) (5). 33 Tex.

Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 18 5.1 PCS Procurement Teams PCS Purchasers and PCS Managers are responsible for facilitating the solicitation process for Invitation s for Bids (IFB), Request s for Application s (RFA), Request s for Offer s (RFO ), Request s for Proposal s (RFP), and Request s for Qualification s (RFQ) . Once a program area submits a requisition initiating a procurement in HHS's Centralized Accounting and Payroll/Personnel System (CAPPS ) Financials , a purchaser is assigned to the procurement. The purchaser contact s the program area, review s the requisition for compliance, coordinates with appropriate representatives from CQC, PCS Historically Underutilized Business (HUB ) program office , and System Contracting , when applicable, and schedule s a kick-off meeting to plan the procurement and develop timelines. It is important to remember that the purchaser cannot commit to reduced timelines on behalf of other divisions. Expedited timelines will need to be discussed with and agreed to with all parties involved. 5.1.1 The Goods Team The Goods Team processes commodities and finished products procurements utilizing : a. Texas Correctional Industries ; b. The Texas Purchasing from People with Disabilities program (managed by the Texas Workforce Commission and, by contract, administered by WorkQu est; c. CPA Term Contracts ; d. The federal government ; and e. Texas Multiple Award Schedule Contracts (TXMAS) , as required . When the Goods Team utilizes competitive procurement methods for goods, the most common is the IFB process . The Goods Team is structured in three major teams to better serve the HHS System : Administrative Goods , IT Goods, and Client Goods . 5.1.1.1 Administrative Goods This team purchases items needed to support administrative staff for all HHS agencies . The team purchases furniture, equipment, appliances, sit-stands, employee awards, retirement gifts, vehicles, golf carts, tools, construction supplies, books, promotional items, clothing , and a high volume of office supplies and paper. 5.1.1.2 Client Goods a. Food: The team purchases food to support the clients living in the State Supported Living Centers (SSLC s) and state hospitals . The team also purchases food, drinks , and snacks for the HHSC canteens, such as produce, dairy, ice cream, bread, dry goods and frozen food. In addition, t he team purchases kitchen equipment, kitchen supplies, linen, utensils , and paper goods. The team pur chases a high volume of frozen food, which is distributed to various facilites as needed. The team also purchases truckloads of water for distribution during declared emergencies. b. Medical: The team purchases medical supplies to support all HHS C agencies, including clients living in the SSLC s and state hospitals. Items purchased include medical and dental equipment, mobility equipment, medical and dental goods, hospital beds, supplements, clothing, medications, and vaccines. The team also purchase s items for DFPS, including car seats, drug kits and other supplies. c. Laboratory: The team purchases items to support multiple tests performed by DSHS and HHSC laboratories. The team purchases laboratory equipment and instruments, chemicals, consumables, labware, plasticware, gloves and other supplies. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 19 d. Material Inventory Management System (MIMS ): The team purchases goods stocked in warehouses at SSLC s and state hospitals . These items are stocked to support patients at the state hospitals , residents at SSLCs , and administrative staff. HHSC has 19 warehouses supplying 24 facilities that stock almost 12,000 inventory items. 5.1.1.3 IT Goods This team purchases information technology goods in compliance with statutory guidelines and dollar t hresholds. IT Goods are generally found on Texas Department of Information Resources (DIR) Cooperative Contracts. These contracts cover a wide variety of information technology products including laptops, desktops, peripherals, video equipment, telecommuni cation equipment, and other technology equipment with an AIS designated NIGP code. State agencies are required to purchase IT goods through the DIR Cooperative Contracts program unless DIR grants a one -time exemption or the IT goods fall under a DIR blanke t exemption. Once an exemption is granted, the IT Goods team may follow other procurement methods including G roup Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) , informal, and formal Invitations for Bid. 5.1.2 The Services Team The Services Team processes administrative, client, and information technology services structured into two major teams to better serve the HHS S ystem. 5.1.2.1 Administrative and Client Services This team procures administrative and client -related services . The team purchases a variety of administrative services , which can include conference registrations, janitorial, electrical, plumbing , and HVAC. Client purchases include services to support the clients living in the SSLCs and state hospitals , services for DFPS Child Protective Services (CPS) and Adult Protective Services (APS) clients and health -related services for DSHS clients, and state disaster -related services . The team uses SPD Term Contracts, Set Aside Programs, which includes Texas Correctional Industries (TCI) and WorkQuest, and TXMAS contracts prior to completing a competitive procurement for services. The competitive procurement is completed through the Invitation for Bid (IFB) method; this process is most appropriate when services are standardized or uniform, with price and meeting specifications being the principal considerations. Administrative Service s Purchase Examples a. Courier Services: The team purchases courier services as an open market. b. Grounds Maintenance : The team purchases lawncare services for the HHS regional offices, state hospitals , and SSLCs through an open market purchase. c. Modular Furniture Installation: If Texas Correctional Industries grants a waiver for the purchase , the team purchases modular furniture installations through open market. Client Services Purchase Examples a. State Operated Facilities: The team purchases services to support the clients residing in the state hospitals and SSLCs , including mental and dental services. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 20 b. DFPS Services: DFPS provides services for APS and CPS. The services may include medical and mental assessments, psychological and counseling services , and substance use disorder services. c. DSHS Services: The team procures services necessary for DSHS clients . These services can include items needed to address health crises, campaigns for public service announcements, and preventative care to ensure the health of clients. d. Disaster Related Services: The team also supports clients through the distribution of truckloads of water and ice during declared emergencies. 5.1.2.2 IT Services Team The team purchases information technology services from DIR contracts and in compliance with statutory guidelines and dollar thresholds. These contracts cover a wide variety of information technology products including: a. Cooperative Contracts: Software, staffing services, maintenance, managed services, technolo gy training, Deliverable -Based Information Technology Services (DBITS), and other services with high customer demand. b. Data Center Services: Mainframe, server, network, data center, and print/mail services. c. Information Security: Services to assure the integ rity, availability, and confidentiality of information assets. d. Telecom: TEX -AN voice and data services, plus wireless, conferencing, and managed services. e. Texas.gov: Payment processing, custom app development, technology and operations, customer service, m arketing and more. f. Services that fall under DIR Blanket and One -Time Exemptions within certain threshold requirements. 5.1.3 The Complex Team Complex procurement is the procurement of services with a high degree of difficulty in developing specifications or statements of work due to the nature of the products or services; a limited or specialty market; delivery to at-risk or vulnerable populations; or the addition of federal regulations and mandates . These procurements are typically high -risk, publicly scrutinized, and subject to multiple oversight entities. The Complex Team is comprised of th e four teams below. 5.1.3.1 Complex Services Tier I This tier of Complex Services procurement professionals process HHS's most complex procurements. Dollar values for these procurements typically range from the hundred - millions to the tens -of-billions. Most often , this team solicits via the Request for Proposals (RFP) or Request for Offers (RFO) method; however, the team also processes a very small number of large -cale professional services procurements using the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) method. Services procured by this group encompas s a broad range of IT and health services, from large pharmaceutical delivery services to our state's managed care organization and supporting IT systems for Medicaid. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 21 5.1.3.2 Complex Services Tier II Like Complex Services Tier I, Tier II most often solicits via the RFP and RFQ method ; however, the team may occasionally process professional services through the RFQ method. Dollar values for these procurements are quite large, but typically do not exceed $100 million . Contract value alone does not dete rmine the tier of a health services procurement , as resource allocation and complexity play a role in assignments. 5.1.3.3 Complex Services Tier III This team primarily processes smaller, routine RFPs, RFOs and RF Qs for providers of professional services, usually less than $1 million in value. For HHSC, the most commonly procured professional services include doctors, nurses, and optometrists; however, professional services can include any of the following: certified public accountants, architects, landscap e architects, land surveyors, physicians (including surgeons), optometrists, professional engineers, real estate appraisers, registered nurses, or interior designers. These services as well as smaller software services and health services procurements will be processed by this team. It is important to remember that professional, consulting, and legal services have very specific requirements outlined in statute . PCS can guide customer organizations through those steps. This team may also process smaller, routine RFPs , if needed , due to workload constraints in the other Health Services teams. 5.1.3.4 Complex Construction The Complex Construction team procures major construction projects for HHSC Maintenance and Construction. The team solicits primarily via the RFP method to procure services aimed at building new state hospitals, renovating old, outdated buildings, and occasionally may assist with the procurement of extensive deferred maintenance. 5.1.4 The Grants Team The Grants Team supports those who improve the health, safety, and well -being of Texans by delivering strategic and collaborative grant services to the HHS System. Grants are used to advance a public purpose through the creation or support of an activity. Grants are strategic investments in the state and its future. Through careful design and planning, the proper solicitation of grant applications is key to transforming grants from a piece of financial assistance into a powerful tool that educates and drives public policy while improving outcomes for Texans. In contrast to the procurement of goods or services, grants use the RFA method to solicit applications and must follow the federal Uniform Grant Guidance (UGG) , state Texas Grant Management Standards (TxGMS) or its successor, published by the SPD, as applicable, as well as other applicable state and federal law. The Grants Team provides strategic and collaborative grant services to the HHS System. The team's chief function is to serve as experts in facilitating the solicitation and selection of qualified applicants to implement grant -funded projects. This is done while navigating and correctly implementing the unique rules, regulations, and procedures associated with the use of state and federal grant funds. 5.1.5 The Business Operations Team The Business Operations Team helps PCS operate with transpar ency and accountability , providing the support need ed to be successful. The team analyze s and report s data to help manage performance ; publish es policies, processes, and procedures ; and equip s staff with information, Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 22 training, and other resources required to work effectively . The Business Operations team includes training , both internal to PCS and agency -wide ; procurement support, including CAPPS and SCOR technical assistance ; and business integrity . In addition, the Business Operations team handles reporting HHS contract information in accordance with the Texas Government Code and the General Appropriations Act (GAA) , Article IX. This includes uploads into the Legislative Budget Board Contracts Database, filing the monthly Texas Purchasing from People with Disabilities Exceptions Report with the CPA, and entering vendor performance data into the CPA Vendor Performance Tracking System (VPTS). 5.1.5.1 Procurement Support Services PCS Customer Service and Level 1 Support staff provide service to PCS staff, potential contractors, public , and agency programs.

Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 24 5.1.6 Historically Underutilized Business (HUB) Program Office HHS is committed to implementing an effective and successful HUB Program. The HUB Program Office provides customer service to the agency's procurement and contracting staff, respondents, HUB businesses , and prime contractors. It develops and implements policies to ensure strict compliance with the state statutes and administrative rules that govern the program. Tasks include , but are not limited to, educating the agency's internal and external customers on HUB requirements; facilitating the inclusion of HUB contract requirements on solicitations valued at $100 ,000 or more through the entire lifecycle of a contract; marketing the agency's HUB Program and procurement opportunities to encourage HUB utilization; administrating the Mentor -Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Program; and tracking and preparing HUB data for reporting and analytical analysis. The HUB Program Office can be contacted at HHSCHUB@hhs.texas.gov . 5.1.7 Contract Management Support Team PCS created the Contract Management Support (CMS) Team in May 2020 as a result of Procurement and Contracting Improvement Plan (PCIP) project team recommendation 17PM : Standardize Contract Management and Monitoring Processes Across HHSC . This team provides contract management support assistance and oversight for HHS staff, leaders and business units with contract management related responsibilities. PCS CMS focuses on strengthening contract management practices by developing policies and procedures, creating tools and templates, monitoring and analyzing key success indicators and working to support program contract management areas when needed. The PCS CMS Unit can be contacted at PCS_CMSupport@hhsc.state.tx.us . 5.1.8 Other In addition to the teams listed in this section, other staff report directly to PCS executive management who are dedicated to overseeing communications for the division ; managing PCS policies, procedures , and forms ; and perform ing other support functions for the division . 5.2 PCS Stakeholder Partner s PCS works closely with other departments and divisions independent from PCS that perform certain functions to help support customer organizations in the procurement and contracting process. Compliance and Quality Control, System Contracting, and Contract Finance Support each have a role in the procurement and contract management lifecycle . (Reference Section 6.5 regarding Management Pillars of Operations ). 5.2.1 Compliance and Quality Control (CQC) CQC was created in April 2018 as an independent division that reported directly to the HHSC Chief Operating Officer (COO). CQC provides compliance and oversight review of PCS and other agency functions to ensure organizational resources and processes align with and satisfy all purchasing and contracting requirements. In March 2020, oversight of the CQC division changed from the COO to the HHSC Chief Policy and Regulatory Officer (CPRO) to strengthen CQC's integrity as a procurement and contract management oversight body by establishing greater operational independence from PCS. As part of its duties, the CQC solicitation review unit (SRU) : a. Reviews and approves all complex solicitations prior to submission for review by the Contract Advisory Team, prior to posting public notice of the solicitation, and prior to the posting of all addenda; Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 25 b. Reviews and validates the evaluation tool; facilitates the complex solicitation evaluation and scoring process in conjunction with PCS Purchaser s; c. Conducts audits concerning the procurement and contracting process including required documentation of procurement files and contract files; and d. Manages the CAPPS template library. In addition to the standard reviews required for complex solicitation s, CQC has an insurance specialist on staff to review these solicitations and make recommendations for required insurance coverages. The CQC insurance review is mandatory for all complex, construction solicitations at the direction of the Deputy Executive Commissioner for HHSC's Health and Specialty Care System and is available as a resource for all complex solicitations. CQC may review, revise, or create, as directed, procurement -related policies, processes, procedures, and rules to ensure compliance with state law and the Comptroller's Guide. CQC also includes the fiscal monitoring unit (FMU) and the single audit unit (SAU) , which monitor recipient and subrecipient grantees to ensure compliance with applicable fiscal requirements of federal and state regulations, HHSC policies, procedures and rules, and contract provisions. 5.2.2 System Contracting System Contracting is a department in the Office of Chief Counsel. System Contracting provides legal assistance and guidance related to procurement and contracting activities. One of System Contracting's primary roles in procurement and contract management is working with PCS and program personnel on solicitations assigned to PCS's complex procurement and grants team s, and with contract managers for contract actions or amendments. PCS and program personnel should work with their management and/or contract managers prior to seeking a System Contracting attorney assignment , as indicated below . 5.2.2.1 System Contracting Intake Request - Attorney Assignment: a. When PCS is involved in a procurement, PCS personnel are responsible for requesting an assigned attorney. b. When PCS is not involved, program personnel are responsible for requesting an assigned attorney . To request a System Contracting attorney assignment, all required information must be provided , including drafts of documents for which review is requested. System Contracting attorney assignment requests should be submitted through the OCC System Contracting Intake Portal . 5.2.2.2 Program Policy Issues For policy issues of a programmatic nature, such as applicable program law or requirements , Program should contact their designated policy attorney or, if they do not have one, the Policy Department in the Office of Chief Counsel at: HHSLegalPolicy@hhsc.state.tx.us . The Policy Department provides general legal advice and support to all HHS agencies and programs in their daily operations, rulemaking efforts, and legislative matters. With significant day-to-day interaction with programs, the Policy Department can help connect programs to resources in other Office of Chief Counsel departments when there is a need for specialized support. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 26 5.2.2.3 Data Governance For assistance with Data Use Agreement s (DUAs) and other matters of confidentiality , Program should contact the Data Governance section within the Office of Chief Counsel's Personnel Department at: OCC_Data_Governance@hhsc.state.tx.us . 5.2.3 Contract Finance Support Contract Finance Support (CFS) is a division of HHSC reporting to the Chief Financial Officer. CFS may provide : a. Financial risk assessment of proposed procurements and assistance identifying the need for a review of financial capacity of any respondents; b. Subject matter expert(s) to evaluate financial capacity submitted with responses; c. Assistance developing cost workbooks and financial provisions and requirements ; d. Subject matter expert(s) to review price component for high -risk, high -value, or other applicable procurements ; and e. Assistance negotiating pricing and developing financial payment structure . Requests for assistance from the CFS division should be emailed to: FSDMajorProcurementsFinancialAnalysis@hhsc.state.tx.us . 6. OVERVIEW OF HHS AGENCY ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES HHS agency staff serve critical roles in different phases of the procurement and contract lifecycle and may assume more than one role during different lifecycle phases. Clearly delineated roles and responsibilities for agency staff reinforce accountability and awareness of decision -making authorities and responsibilities. Key roles with expected responsibilities are expressed in categories of Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed (RACI) . See definitions for categories in the RACI Definitions table below. The RACI matrices consist of key functions of the procurement and contracting system, which are generally listed in chronological order. The primary function of the matrices is not to show process or workflow , but rather to articulate expectations of various roles and responsibilities for key functions . Responsible Accountable Consulted Informed The role assigned to perform the function. The single authority/owner to make decisions; accountable that the function is performed. The accountable role is the role that follows through on required consultation and informing to ensure that required stakeholders are consulted and/or informed. The role that is consulted on the function and consulted on outputs of the function. Consultation is not optional. * The accountable and responsible are expected to take input from the consultation into account, with the expectation of two-way communication . The role is informed due to a dependency on the function. Informing is not optional. * Not informing impacts the dependability of the system. Expectation of one-way communication . * Unless otherwise specified. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 27 6.1 Customer Organizations Roles Customer organizations are the agencies, offices, divisions, departments, sections, and units that receive procurement and contracting information, guidance, and services from PCS, including departmental groups within PCS. These customer organizations are components of the following agencies or areas: HHSC, DSHS, DFPS, Office of the Inspector General (OIG), TCCO, and other governmental entities that PCS supports. Customer organizations who initiate a procurement will assign staff to serve in certain roles. These include: a. Customer Organization Program/Contract Management role: a coordinating area within the customer organization pursuing a procurement or contract. Program staff will have subject matter expertise related to the goods or services sought , while contract managers facilitate the procurement process on behalf of the program area. Program areas may also have financial, IT, and data related subject matter experts (SMEs) that participate in a procurement at the program level. Many areas in the organization may have either a representative from the program area and/ or a representative from the contract management area leading the procurement on behalf of the customer organization. b. Customer Organization Evaluators : staff from the customer organization area assigned to score proposals /applications or participate in oral presentations. c. Customer Organization Contract Attorney or other attorneys : the assigned contract attorney, or other attorneys, that support the corresponding customer organization program. d. Customer Organization Information Technology role: the relevant information technology department within the customer organization that supports programs on information technology (IT) matters. When the departments within HHSC IT initiate a procurement, those departmental areas serve in a customer organization capacity. e. Customer Organization Finance/Budget role: the relevant agency financial and budgetary departments within the customer organization that supports programs on financial and budgetary matters. 6.2 PCS Roles PCS has key roles that support customer organizations in the procurement and contracting process. These are: a. PCS Purchaser : a qualified purchaser with a CTCD certification that is assigned to process a procurement. b. PCS Liaison : a liaison with a CTCD certification providing support to customer organizations on specific procurements, as requested . c. PCS Manage r: the manager of the PCS Purchaser responsible for overseeing the quality of work and adherence to procurement regulations. d.

CQC Financial Analyst: a financial analyst assigned to a complex procurement or grant solicitation to review and validate the evaluation tool. b. CQC Insurance Specialist: an insurance specialist assigned to review or provide insurance recommendations for a complex procurement or grant solicitation . c. CQC Solicitation Reviewer: a contract administration manager assigned to review and approve a complex procurement or grant solicitation .The Procurement Lifecycle Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 28 6.4 PCS Operating Model The image below depicts the PCS Operating Model , including the HHS Procurement and Contract Management Lifecycle. The Procurement and Contract Management Lifecycle is a continuous process with common characteristics that exist between all public procurements. Following each of the processes outlined belo w helps to ensure that the procurement is conducted in a transparent and efficient manner. The Procurement and Contracting Management Lifecycle identifies the five phases performed for every procurement. While the Comptroller's Guide distinguishes grants as separate from the procur ement of goods and services, the solicitation, evaluation, selectio n and management of grants largely follows this same lifecycle. In addition, PCS has developed a detailed framework for the procurement end to end process37 located on the PCS SharePoint site. Phase 1: Procurement Planning Define the business need and establish the procurement objectives; Phase 2: Procurement Method Determination Identify the appropriate Procurement Method and, if applicable, issue a solicitation; Phase 3: Vendor Selection Fairly and objectively select the vendor that provides best value to the state; 37 Procurement and Contract Improvement Plan (PCIP ) (22PP) Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 29 Phase 4: Contract Formation and Award Ensure that the awarded contract complies with applicable procurement law and contains provisions that achieve the procurement objectives; and Phase 5: Contract Management Administer and enforce the terms of the contract, including termination and closeout. 6.5 Management Pillars of Operations The PCS Operating Model is supported by the four management pillars of operations, illustrated in the image above as Quality Management, Risk Management, Communications, and Training . The pillars span the entire procurement and contra ct management lifecycle and apply to the staff stakeholders that support the processes, including PCS, System Contracting , Contract Finance Support , CQC , and customer organizations (Refer ence Section 5.2 regarding PCS Stakeholder Partners ). 6.5.1 Quality Management Ensures quality work products and services throughout the procurement and contracting processes, which translates, either directly or indirectly, to quality services for clients. 6.5.2 Risk Management Management and monitoring of risks are critical aspects of procurement and contracting operations for proactive decision -making, ensuring compliance, and optimizing resources. 6.5.3 Communications An effective and efficient procurement and contracting system requires timely, relevant, and clear communication between participants that supports the procurement and contracti ng system. 6.5.4 Training Training expands the knowledge base and skillset of employees, so they can perform their jobs well. For procurement and contracting functions, training provides benefits such as improved employee performance and satisfaction, consistency in services, and compliance with state statutes. 30 Diagram outlining the procurement process. Step 1 Procurement Planning Step 2 Procurement Method and Solicitation Step 3 Vendor Selection Step 4 Contract Formation and Award Step 5 Contract Management Fundamental guidelines are quality management, risk management, communication, and training. Procurement Planning Procurement and Contract Management Handbook v. 1.0 31 7. PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT Procurement planning is the process of deciding what to buy, when to buy, and from what source, based on an identified need. Identifying and defining a need begins the procurement and contract management lifecycle and provides the basis for the contract. As a resource for state agenc ies regarding allowable expenditures , the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts created the eXpendit website to provide information to state agencies and institutions of higher education on how to properly carry out purchase transactions while complying with certain provisions of the constitution, statutes and rules of Texas related to expenditures. Planning activities, at a minimum, include developing a needs assessment, a cost estimate , and an acquisition plan. For relatively simple and routine procurements, like purchases using the set aside programs (State Use program and TCI program), Texas SmartBuy, or informal bidding, the planning may be as simple as development of an accurate requisition . For complex procurements, the timeline for the planning and development phase could range from several months to a year or more , depending on the complexity of the requirements and the number of coordinating departmental areas involved in the procurement. Factors to consider in planning for any procurement include: a. Procurement lead times; b. Needs assessment; c. Specifications and requirements gathering; d. Risk management; e. Contract value or cost estimate ; and f. Contractor or subrecipient determination. 7.1 Procurement Lead Times Procurement lead time is the interval between a decision to purchase a product or service to when the contract is awarded .38 Generally, the PCS Purchaser, in coordination with program area staff and contract manager, will develop a procurement timeline. The timeline should include all key milestones for completing the procurement within required deadlines. However, it is the program area 's responsibility to conduct appropriate planning and development activities prior to being assigned a PCS Purchaser considering the overall procurement lead time. PCS Liaisons are available to assist program areas in planning and development activities prior to a PCS Purchaser assignment (Reference Section 5.1.5.2 regarding PCS Liaison) . PCS has developed estimated procurement timelines for HHS customers to serve as a resource for procurement planning. The Procurement Action Lead Time Schedule (PALTS) contains estimated procurement timelines for the different methods of procurements. Considerations when determining a procur ement timeline include: a. Complexity of the procurement; b. Internal approvals; c. External reviews; 38 Comptroller's Guide, Solicitation Process. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 32 d. Waiver and exemption requests , including those from TCI and WorkQuest indicating that the product or service may be otherwise procured ; e. Exemption requests (Data Center Services and Cooperative Contracts) from the DIR indicating that the product or service may be otherwise procured ; f. Internal proprietary purchase justification approval; g. Emergency purchases; h. Internal budget approval; i. Procurement specific delegation request to CPA for goods exceeding $50,000 via email open.market@cpa.texas.gov or for services with an estimated contract value of more than $100,000 via POD web portal found on the Texas SmartBuy website , as applicable ; j. Contract Advisory Team (CAT) review for procurements with a value of at least $5 million ;39 k. Quality Assurance Team (QAT) review for major information resources projects (MIRP) with a value of at least $10 million ; 40 l. Finding of Fact from the Governor 's Office for major consulting procurements ; and m. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)/Food & Nutrition Service (FNS) reviews (120 days or more ). (Reference Section 14.10.3 , for more information ). 7.2 Needs Assessment The needs assessment must contain sufficient detail to identify the key business requirements. By clearly defining the need at the beginning of the procurement and contract management lifecycle during the procurement planning phase, the following outcomes should be achieved : a. Facilitates effective prioritizatio n of the required funding to make the purchase; b. Establishes if the service can be provided by internal resources; c. Determines how these proposed goods/services fit with existing programs, systems, etc.; d. Identifies the type and level of service required to meet the need; e. Establishes the procurement objective; f. Provide s framework to develop the statement of work, solicitation, evaluation, and contract documents; g. Establishes whether confidential information will be exchanged under the contract, identify the Information Owner and Designee, and assess the information security risk level; h. Determine s level of insurance necessary to provide protection and mitigate risk to the HHS agency or the HHS System; and i. Provide s necessary information to determine how performance and quality of goods or service delivery will be measured, documented and tracked, as well as specific remedies, sanctions, and/or damages if requirements, specific performance measures , and/or milestones are not met. 7.3 Factors for Assessing Need The following factors must be considered when assessing need for a procurement : a. State or federal laws, rules, or regulations; 39 Tex. Gov't Code and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 33 b. HHS agency or system -wide policy; c. Executive Commissioner or another applicable official directive; d. The costs and benefits of the proposed contract; e. Potential ethical or conflict of interest issues that may arise; f. Potential risks to the HHS agency or the HHS System that may result if the need is not met; g. Level of priority or importance of the need; h. Availability of funding, staff, expertise, and other resources to meet the need; i. Cost -effectiveness of the goods and services; j. Cost savings and efficiencies in use of contracted goods and services; k. Availability of funds; l. Any legal concerns or potential issues; m. Availability of other sources, including internal resources, to meet the need; and n. Existing opportunities to reduce cost or resources. PCS created online training modules to assist program staff and requesters with needs assessment , including a specific module on the CAPPS Financials Wizard. HHS staff can access CAPPS training on the PCS Training Site. 7.4 Risk Management Risk management is critical to procurement and contracting operations and should be carefully reviewed and monitored as a continuous process. HHSC is required to develop and comply with a purchasing accountability and risk analysis procedure, as stated in Section 2261.256(a) of the Texas Government Code . Stakeholders must incorporate risk management practices at each procurement phase and strive to mitigate risks at the earliest possible moment by utilizing risk assessment tools and implementing necessary controls. One risk management tool is the Procurement Risk Assessment (PCS Form 148). Program staff must complete the form and attach to the requisition.41 For RFx (i.e., RFP, RFO, RFA, RFQ) procurements, the form is reviewed and approved with all attendees at the kick-off meeting. For other procurements, program staff and PCS Purchaser must discuss and approve the form. Once approved, PCS Purchaser must incorporate the form into the procurement file. If the completed form results in a high-risk score, a risk-based review of the procur ement must be conducted with the procurement team via teleconference or an in-person meeting to discuss risk mitigation and communication strategies for identified risk factors. Any changes to risk levels during the procurement process must be noted in the Updates section of the form. 7.5 Contract Value Estimate During the procurement planning phase, program must determine a cost estimate that will be used for the procurement . The Max Potential Contract Value42 must be entered into CAPPS Financials Wizard . The cost estimate must be developed in good faith , as it will be used not only in the selection of the appropriate procurement method and determining appropriate approvals , but also for compliance with statutory requirements that may be applicable to the purchase , based on contract value, funding source , or 41 Procurement Risk Assessment Instructions . 42 The estimated dollar amount that an agency may be obligated to pay pursuant to the contract and all executed and proposed amendments, extensions and renewals of the contract. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 34 expenditure restrictions and prohibitions ,43 as well as required internal agency approvals. The cost estimate should be documented and included in the procurement file. In accordance with the Comptroller's Guide and CPA administrative rule,44 for SPD reporting, review, and delegation requirements, contract value is defined as \"the estimated dollar amount that an agency may be obligated to pay pursuant to the contract and all executed and proposed amendment s, extensions and renewals of the contract .\" In other words, the contract value is the total maximum potential value of the contract since all potential renewals and extensions are included. It is imperative that a reasonable estimate of the contract value is established at the beginning of the procurement process because it drives the approval path and determines applicable statutory requirements. Staff must not under -estimate the contract value in order to circumvent required review submissions, such as to CAT. The payment method and source of funds are not necessary to be considered in determining the maximum potential contract value. PCS procurement staff must be notified before any changes to the maximum potential contract value is approved. A contract value estimate is typically developed by using one or more of the following methods: a. Market research , which may include methods such as: online research, review of industry periodicals and information obtained from professional organizations, attendance at trade shows, discussions with other customers, informal budget quote by contacting several vendors to obtain pricing information, using a vendor's advertised price list, and consultations with industry representatives ; b. Historical cost estimate is developed through a historical spend analysis of the agency's similar contracts and/or other agency purchasing data ; c. Estimate developed in collaboration with subject matter experts within the agency; d. Issuing a Request for Information (RFI) , which gathers information directly from the industry about a particular type of product or service; e. Set amount driven by the funding source, such as a grant for a specified dollar amount; and f. Benchmarking, the comparison of a particular item, service, or process with other entities or an established industry standard. 7.6 Request for Information (RFI) A Request for Information (RFI) is a formal research method used by an agency to gather information directly from the industry about a particular type of product or service. One of the benefits of the RFI process is that information, pertinent to an agency's business need, is obtained in real -time directly from the vendor community regarding applicable industry standards, best practices, potential performance measures, cost structures or pricing methodogies, and feedback on innovative items. A common practice is to publish the RFI on the ESBD or submit the RFI to an appropriate professional or trade organization. This practice has the benefit of not only utilizing a venue that optimizes access by the vendor community, but also serves to control vendor communications so that they only occur with designated agency contacts. By establishing a pres cribed communication protocol at the beginning of the RFI process, the agency is ensuring that a \"level playing field\" is maintained within the vendor community if there is a subsequent procurement initiative. It is important to note that an RFI is not a p rocurement opportunity; a contract cannot be developed from a response to an RFI. Responses to an RFI are strictly voluntary and there is no downside for vendors who 43 Comptroller's Guide, Procurement P lanning. 44 34 TAC \u00a7 20.25(b)(13) . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 35 choose not to participate; consequently, an RFI cannot be used to establish a pre -qualifie d vendor list as voluntary participation in the RFI process cannot disadvantage vendors that choose not to participate. Vendors may choose not to participate in RFIs for a variety of reasons. For instance, a vendor may have a company policy of not respondi ng to RFIs. Vendors may also decide, on a case -by-case basis, not to respond to RFIs seeking information readily available on the internet. The number of responses to an RFI, therefore, should not be used to gauge industry interest in any subsequent procur ement initiative. An agency may choose to use information received from RFI responses to develop specifications for a solicitation. Responses to RFIs, therefore, are public information. Public procurement professionals must be mindful not to provide any in formation during the RFI process that would give a vendor an advantage in a later procurement or could be construed as preliminary negotiations. If RFI respondents are requested to deliver oral presentations, the same agency staff should attend all present ations and the respondents should be offered the same amount of time to conduct their presentations. It is best practice for RFI activities to conclude prior commencement of specifications drafting. Steps for posting a n RFI: a. Draft th e RFI using the same SM Es that will be involved in drafting your SOW. Make sure all relevant users and any program area attorneys that might have an interest in the outcome of the procurement get a chance to review the RFI. b. Submit a requisition with the final RFI document attach ed and inform PCS know of the closing date and if any groups should be notified regarding the posting. c. PCS will post the RFI and return the responses to program after closing. The RFI responses may be used to inform your SOW development. 7.7 Procurement Planning Results and Outputs A sound procurement plan helps program areas define their procurement requirements and to decide where , when , and how to procure. Key results and outputs to the planning process include solicitation and evaluation documents, source selection criteria, the statement of work, specific insurance requirements , and the CAPPS requisition. 7.8 Procurement Forecast and Action Plan (PFAP) PCS Policy 357 The Procurement Forecast and Action Plan (PFAP) establishes additional procurement planning requirements for agencies/divisions to ensure timely contract execution. Each agency/division that the PCS procurement department supports must complete and submit a Procurement Forecast and Action Plan (PFAP) to PCS by November 1st on an annual basis. The Procurement Forecast and Action Plan (PFAP) must include information for the following types of procurements: a. Request for Proposals (RFP) b. Request for Application ( RFA) c. Request for Qualifications (RFQ) d. Information Technology Request for Offers (RFO) e. Invitation for Bids (IFB) over $25,000 f. DIR procurements that include a Statement of Work over $50,000. Procurement Forecast and Action Plans are meant to serve as a bench mark for each agency/division to track and report on procurement goals including reporting to executive leadership. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 36 7.8.1 IT Procurement Forecast and Action Plan (PFAP) Effective September 1, 2021, the HHSC Information Technology (IT) division transitioned from the IT Purchasing Plan (ITPP) to the IT Procurement Forecast and Action Plan (IT PFAP) as the method for requesting purchasing authority. Purchasing au thority means approval from the chief information officer to procure an IT -related good or service with a value of $50,000 or more. Before an HHSC division or DSHS may enter a requisition for a procurement of an IT -related good or service with a value of $ 50,000 or more, the procurement must be on the approved IT PFAP and assigned a purchasing authority reference number. The purchasing authority reference number must be included on the requisition or it will be denied by the PCS division. The HHSC IT divisi on completes the IT PFAP annually and updates it quarterly. HHSC IT division staff coordinate with each HHSC division and DSHS to identify procurements that must be included on the IT PFAP. A procurement that is on the IT PFAP does not need to be included on the PFAP for the respective HHSC division or DSHS. HHSC divisions and DSHS must still report RFx and IFB procurements for IT - related goods and services with a value of more than $25,000 but less than $50,000 on their PFAP. The Department of Family and P rotective Services (DFPS) and the Texas Civil Commitment Office (TCCO) must include all procurements for IT -related goods or services with a value more than $25,000 on their PFAP. 7.9 The Statement of Work (SOW) The SOW is the detailed description of the scope of work, product or services the agency is purchasing and what the contractor is required to provide to be considered for an award and to satisfactorily perform the work. From a procurement process perspective, the SOW must be completed and attached to the requisition for complex procurements, IT services procurements , or informal and formal IFB for services in order for the procurement process to begin. It is important that the SOW : a. Be clearly defined; b. Be logically organized and tailored to the business need; c. Be contractually sound; d. Be unbiased and non-prejudiced toward respondents; e. Encourage innovative solutions to the requirements described, if appropriate; and f. Allow for free and open competition to the maximum extent reasonably possible. 7.9.1 SOW Types A statement of work can be performance -based, a design specification, or a mixture of both :45 a. Performance -based specifications focus on outcomes or results rather than processes, and on the required goods and services rather than how the goods and services are provided. b. Design specifications outline exactly how the contractor must perform the service or how the goods perform. 7.9.2 Drafting Specifications 45 Comptroller's Guide, Scope of Work. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 37 All specifications should: a. Permit competition between products of equal quality; b. Include a statement regarding the qualitative nature of the purchase; and c. Identify the minimum essential characteristics and standards to which the purchase must conform if it is to satisfy the intended use. 7.9.3 SOW Development Tips to keep in mind when writing a statement of work: a. Identify SMART objectives: specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely. b. Consider appropriate project development or design methodology . Waterfall methodology works well with projects that have assured predictability , like construction projects. Agile methodology is intended for projects that may benefit from incremental development and successes, like software development. c. Use simple descriptions: Write so a person unfamiliar with the good or service can easily understand what the agency is buying. d. Avoid acronyms and definitions: Avoid acronyms and references to definitions contained in other sections of the solicitation, including a glossary. e. State requirements once: The statement of work shou ld not duplicate terms and conditions or other provisions in the solicitation, contract, or terms and conditions. f. Use non-proprietary terminology: Requiring the use of proprietary goods or services limits competition and increases the risk of a bid challenge or allegation that the requirements are slanted to a particular contractor. g. Write with the evaluation criteria in mind: The statement of work must include all of the requirements that will be used to evaluate and choose a contractor. A well-written statement of work will allow the agency to differentiate between competing proposals. 7.9.4 SOW Best Practices An SOW brings together work details, schedules, terms, and expected outcomes to define exactly what should be done on a project and how it should be procured, as well as to protect against scope creep , where features, additions, and nice-to-haves can balloon beyond what was initially planned. A good SOW involves team collaboration to collectively build a solid business requirement document that describes how requirements will be executed, analyzed, and managed . Moreover, a contract manager should participate in the development of the statement of work and be part of the team early in the process . 7.9.4.1 Primary Sources While a SOW is unique for each project, best practices in writing an SOW share basic elements that are generally consistent across projects . Primary sources for developing the SOW are: a. Needs assessment; b. Previous procurement for the service; c. Any current or prior contracts for the service and how those contracts did or did not result in the desired outcomes; and Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 38 d. Description of the service maintained by the agency (e.g., in the TAC or agency program handbook). 7.9.4.2 Key Elements When developing an SOW, the drafter should not only consider the elements of proper specification drafting, but also other elements such as key performance measures (desired outcomes , such as a 99% answer rate in a call center), deliverables (such as reports), project milest ones, and other aspects to ensure the outcome of the contractor's work meets the outcomes intended by the program. When PCS reviews an SOW submitted by a program area, they assess the following key elements : a. Sufficient detail : The SOW must contain sufficiently detailed description of what is required of the contractor to satisfactorily perform the work. The program must ensure that all requested goods and/or services are clearly stated. b. Clear deliverables and deadlines: The SOW should outline the deliverables and associated deadlines clearly and completely. It must also identify the responsible party for each deliverable. Clarity in responsible party for each task is imperative in holding the contractor accountable. c. Acceptance criteria: Specify how the agency will determine if the product or service is acceptable. d. Contractor performance and financial capacity : The SOW must clearly specify the contractor qualifications, experience, and financial capability being requested in the proposal. e. Consider the dollar amount: Program areas should consider the dollar amount when requesting evidence of financial capability. High estimated value of contracts may need more evidence from a respondent of financial viability. Examples of proof of financial viability include contacting bidder's current customers, written descriptions of size and scope of operations, prior contracting experience with the State, balance sheets, D&B reports, or an audited statement by a CPA. f. Eligible population: Define and describe the population eligible to receive services under the resulting contract and ensure it is consistent with the eligibility information in existing program documentation, such as the program handbook, as applicable. Identify who will determine eligibility. g. Characteristics of the service population: Define the characteristics of the individuals to be served under the resulting contract. The intent is to give the contractor information on the population it will be serving. For example, will individuals served be court -ordered into services, receiving services voluntarily, have open abuse and neglect cases. h. Service authorization and referral process: Identify how individuals will be referred for services provided by the contractor (e.g., agency, self-referral, contractor outreach) and describe the process, including any forms, through which individuals will be referred or approved for services. i. Location of work or service areas: Describe where the work is to be performed (e.g., region, counties, cities, zip codes) and where people will meet to do the work. j. Period of performance: Specify the allowable dates for projects, such as start and finish time, number of hours that can be billed per week or month, and anything else that relates to scheduling. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 39 k. Deliverables schedule: List and describe what is due and when, including any reports the contractor is required to submit. l. Minimum qualifications: List the minimum acceptable qualifications for the service provider's staff and organization. m. Professional licenses and certifications: Describe the applicable license and certification standard s required for completing the work . n. Record keeping: Describe in detail all records the contractor and service providers are required to keep , such as: referral records, individuals' records, case files, reports, notifications, performance measure supporting documentation, billing records, personnel records, subcontractor files and agreements, licenses, certifications, qualifications, background check results, health records, or investigation records. Specify the format for these records. o. Established standards: Describe any regulatory, agency, or industry specific standards that need to be followed in fulfilling the contract. p. Type of contract and payment schedule: Define the payment methodology, basis for payment, and invoicing process. q. Liquidated damages and other remedies: Determine whether liquidated damages are appropriate (e.g., for failure to meet specific performance measures or milestones ), as well as stating other remedies (such as, corrective action plan s, escalated monitoring, payment holds) that may be applied if contract requirements (e.g., specific performance measures and/or reporting requirements ) are not met. All remedies that may be utilized must be stated in the solicitation. Some remedies, one common example being contract termination, are included in HHS's Uniform Terms and Conditions (UTCs ). In drafting the SOW, care should be taken to ensure consistency regarding damages and remedies throughout the entire solicitation package. r. Monitoring activities: Describe the strategy to be used to monitor and assess contractor performance. s. Transition and turnover planning: Identify any transition activities the new contractor will be required to perform in order to be ready to effectively provide services on the contract effective date. Identify any transition activities the new contractor will be required to perform at the end of their contract in order to effectively transition individuals and services to a subsequent contractor, as well as the anticipated time period for transition activities. 7.9.5 Contract Performance Standards and Key Measures Including perform ance measures in the SOW sets the expectation of performance. Contracts must include specific performance measures that set clear expectations for the contractor and hold contractors accountable for those expectations. Performance measures encourage routine improvement, effectiveness, and efficiency. Strong performance measures allow the HHS System to: a. Establish performance measures with clearly defined indicators; b. Develop processes for collecting performance data and information; c. Develop processes for analyzing and reporting data and information; d. Conduct quality improvement planning, implementation, and evaluation; e. Ensure contract goals, objectives, and strategies align with outcomes; Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 40 f. Operate efficiently and effectively; g. Maximize resources; and h. Provide data to determine whether contractors are meeting their objectives. Contracts must specify remedies for noncompliance (e.g., contract termination) and may include any incentives for exceeding standards. Performance standards will vary based on the contract and additional standards may be necessary. 7.9.6 Characteristics of Good Key Performance Measures The SOW must contain minimum objective performance standards that are clearly stated , so that contractor's performance under any resulting contract can be monitored and measured. For services, PCS will look for program's method, procedure, or test condition to verify each stated performance standard. For commodity elements, PCS will look for means for program to verify quantity and whether specifications are met. The characteristics of good key performance measures include the following: a. Simple: Can our stakeholders understand it? b. Relevant: Does it matter to key stakeholders? c. Stable: Is it usable during business cycles over time? d. Timely: Is it taken when and where results appear? e. Accurate: Does it consistently measure what it purports to? f. Used: Does it change what the agency is doing? g. Informative: Does it tell us about what we are doing, or should be doing? h. Specific: Does it allow for, or factor out, other measures? i. Unique: Is it measuring something already measured? j. Cost -effective: Is measuring worth it, and how good is good enough? k. Non -disruptive: Does it create ethical, legal , or other types of conflicts? KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES Types and Definitions Examples Outcome and Effectiveness: Measurable indicator of the agency's effectiveness in serving its customers and in reaching the mission, goals, and objectives. a. Percentage of provider enrollment applications processed in 30 days . b. Percentage of licensed providers inspected annually. c. Percentage of providers with no violations. Output: Measurable indicator of the number or volume of services an agency produces. Used to assess workload and the agency's efforts to address those demands. a. Number of substance abuse beneficiaries in the program. b. Number of inspections conducted. c. Number of provider applications processed. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 41 KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES Efficiency: Measurable indicator of productivity expressed in unit costs, units of time, or other ratio -based units. Used to assess the cost-efficiency, productivity, and timeliness of agency operations, outcomes, and outputs. a. Average cost per case. b. Average cost per inspection. c. Average time for complaint resolution. Explanatory/Input: Indicator of factors, agency resources, or requests received that can impact an agency's performance. a. Percentage of medical school graduates entering a primary care residency. b. Number of business facilities registered. c. Number of cases received. 7.10 Contractor Compensation The method of payment has a direct impact on how the SOW is written and how the contract is managed. HHS agencies must measure or verify that the work is complete and how much and how often the agency will pay the contractor, if more specific than stated in the Uniform Terms and Conditions. Program should be mindful of, and consistent with, applicable law (e.g., the Texas Prompt Payment Act) Payments should be: a. Consistent with the type of product or service delivered; b. Structured to fairly compensate the contractor and encourage timely and complet e performance of work; c. Approximately equal to the value of the completed work; and d. The solicitation should specify the payment type (fees, costs, and price) that is consistent with the type and value of work performed and as defined in the solicitation. Retainage may be considered under payment provisions, as well. 7.11 Determination of Payment Type Determination of the appropriate compensation method to make payment to the contractor helps ensure the State receives the best value. 7.11.1 Compensation Method/Primary Payment Type HHS agency staff must determine the most effective compensation method or primary payment type during the procurement planning stages. The payment type selected will be one that best ensures: a. Delivery of services; b. Efficiencies and effectiveness of those service; and c. The best value to the program and individuals served. 7.11.2 Multiple Payment Types In some cases, the best structure may include multiple payment types for different services within the same contract. Examples of payment types include : a. Cost Plus Incentive ; Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 42 b. Fee-for-Service ; c. Fixed Price ; d. Performance Based ; e. Rate Based ; and f. Time and Material . 7.12 Selection Methodology \u2014Evaluation Team Selection & Scoring 7.12.1 Method of Vendor Selection The most common selection method is evaluation of the written proposal through individual aggregate scoring. The written proposal is scored by individual evaluation team members, to come up with an average score for each respondent in each evaluation criteria. The evaluat ion criteria are then totaled according to advertised weights in the solicitation, and the highest scoring respondent is awarded the resulting contract. However, other methods and variations exist, such as consensus scoring and the addition of secondary ev aluations, such as interviews or oral presentations. In a consensus scoring approach, individual evaluators read the proposals prior to evaluation work sessions and note their observations of strengths, weaknesses, and questions regarding the respondent's proposal. There are specialized procedures to follow for consensus scoring and evaluators must undergo significantly more training to participate than evaluators participating in individual aggregate scoring. Once all proposals have been reviewed individua lly, the evaluation team will meet to develop consensus scores for each respondent. In either individual aggregate scoring or consensus scoring, secondary evaluations may be utilized to further separate the respondents. Use of consensus scoring and seconda ry evaluation methods must be reviewed and approved by PCS. Alternatively, PCS may recommend the use of these methods if it is believed to be beneficial to the overall procurement. The most common mistakes made when developing the selection methodology inv olving secondary evaluations are: a. Not clearly identifying how respondents are selected for secondary evaluations; b. Not including a justifiable scoring methodology for secondary evaluations; and c. Not detailing the process for selection from written evaluation , to competitive range, tosecondary evaluations, to final selection. Clearly stating the methodology at each step, including secondary evaluations , will help avoid issues resulting from solicitation ambiguity, such as vendor protests or perceptions of impr opriety. Additionally, ensuring that the evaluation team is knowledgeable enough to make justifiable judgment calls is equally important. Program area staff and PCS purchasers can use PCS Form 542, Evaluation Team Template t o collect information on evaluators and determine if the selected team is appropriate for the procurement in question. For procurements valued at $20 million dollars or more, the PCS Form 542 is required by statute46 and the State of Texas Procurement and Contract Management Guide.47 If the procurement is large -scale and technically complex in several areas, consensus scoring may improve overall outcomes. (Reference Section 13.2.3 regarding Respondent Evaluation, for more information on vendor selection and evaluation scoring ). 46 Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 2262.051(i)(3) . 47 Comptroller's Guide, Evaluation Committee. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 43 7.12.2 Determining Whether to Use Secondary Evaluation Methods PCS Op erating Procedure 543 Procurements that are late or otherwise short on time should not have secondary evaluations included. Furthermore, they are utilized only for highly complex, high -value procurements where written proposals are unlikely to sufficien tly identify the respondent(s) providing best value and risk of project failure is high in the event of poor contractor selection. If expressly permitted by the solicitation, secondary evaluations may take place for those respondents that pass all initial and minimum qualifications screening and meet the advancement criteria specified in the solicitation after the evaluation of the written responses. If secondary evaluations are to be conducted, all associated advancement criteria must be explicitly stated in the solicitation's selection methodology. Advancement criteria is the criteria criteria for a respondent to advance to the next phase of evaluation if secondary evaluation methods are utilized. A solicitation's selection methodology may include one of t he following secondary evaluations, when applicable: a. Interviews are used to clarify written responses by addressing gaps in expectations and uncovering assumptions made by both agency/program and respondents. Solicitations for novel, or highly complex, ser vices or products tend to be prone to these issues and can benefit from the use of interviews. When agency/program expectations significantly vary from market offerings, interviews can address these variations and verify a respondent's ability to meet agen cy/program needs, as specified by the solicitation. Of all the secondary evaluation methods, interviews tend to be the least resource intensive. However, they are still more time and resource intensive than procurements that are evaluated on the basis of t he written responses alone. b. Oral presentations are used to provide an opportunity for respondents to highlight the strengths and unique aspects of their solicitation responses. They are suitable for use when the potential respondents are reasonably anticip ated due to a niche market or historical knowledge. This secondary evaluation method is particularly useful under the following circumstances: i. more than one respondent is expected to meet the needs of a procurement based on agency/program area's historical or industry knowledge or ii. actual contractor performance is anticipated to be highly variable regardless of the submission of high -quality proposals. In the first circumstance, the goal is to separate a pool of Respondents expected to score closely by focus ing scenarios that represent the agency/program's ultimate objective and allow the respondents to be innovative and exceed expectations. In the second circumstance, the goal is to speak with representatives of a company and explore actual scenarios to dete rmine if their ability to quickly strategize and convey information in real time is in alignment with the submitted written response. The first and second circumstances, and their associated goals, are not mutually exclusive. c. Site visits are used to assess or evaluate a proposed site. agency/program may wish to use this method as an opportunity to view the location, verify the surroundings, and analyze the site to ensure it meets the solicitation requirements. d. Demonstrations are most often used for the proc urement of information technology or solution -based offerings, via the Request for Offers (RFOs). The method may also apply to Requests for Proposals (RFPs) where software is a smaller component of the overall procurement. Demonstrations allow agency/progr am to verify proposed product functionality and to ensure the product meets the agency/program needs. Demonstrations also may be Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 44 used to confirm the functionality or configuration of highly customized scientific or medical equipment. Despite the specific m ethod used, any secondary evaluation must be fair to all respondents. All respondents must be allowed the same amount of time to prepare; review questions, scenarios or use cases; and present. See also, PCS Operating Procedure 543, Secondary Evaluations . 7.12.3 Consensus Scoring PCS Operating Procedure 544 In a consensus scoring approach, the evaluation team meets to develop consensus scores for each respondent. This process may take a few hours or a few days, depending on the number and length of proposals and the availability of the Evaluation Team members . Oral Presentations, Demonstrations, and Site Visits must be scored using consensus scoring, regardless of the scoring method used for the written responses. Interviews will utilize the same method as the written responss evaluation. See PCS Operating Procedure 544, Consensus Scoring . During consensus scoring sessions, the evaluation team facilitator directs the team's attention to each item in the evaluation criteria. The evaluation team considers one proposal at a time, compar ing the respondent's proposed offering against the specifications in the underlying RFx. Consensus scoring sessions encourage open discussions and questions among members of the evaluation team. Evaluators discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of a respondent's proposal in each area. Open debate about a respondent's statement or response is encouraged to help ensure nothing proposed by a respondent in response to a requirement is overlooked. This discussion may provide additional insight into the re spondent's offering and/or correct misperceptions held by individual evaluators. For these reasons, a consensus rating arrived at by the evaluation team after consideration and discussion of all information provided by a respondent can represent a more acc urate assessment of the respondent's offering than a mathematical averaging of individual evaluator's scores. It is important to remember that, even with these benefits, it may not be a fit for all procurements. Some procurements that are smaller -scale and have plenty of individual subject matter experts may be better suited to individual evaluations with averaging, especially if there is difficulty blocking schedules and the evaluators are not experienced with participating in procurements. The consensus process can take days, or even weeks, depending on the size of the proposals, complexity of the procurement, and availability of the evaluation team. The general process for conducting consensus scoring includes: 7.12.3.1 Step 1: Evaluation Team Formation The evaluation team must be selected in advance of the commencement of evaluation training, ideally in the early stages of solicitation drafting. The members must be subject matter experts in some or all the RFx's topic. Evaluation teams should be kept to a manageable size -not less than five and not more than eight total evaluators. 7.12.3.2 Step 2: Minimum Qualifications Review Some RFPs may include minimum qualifications which, upon review, may disqualify a respondent. These items are not scored and represent requirem ents respondents must demonstrate to be considered for award. Many of these can be handled in PCS's initial screening of these responses. However, some may require the program to conduct a Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 45 minimum qualification review due to the expertise required to scree n, and these will be accounted for in the consensus meetings using the Consensus Scoring Rubric. Proposals that fail to meet any of the minimum qualifications in an RFP are to be rejected. Documentation supporting this decision should be placed on the Resp ondent's Consensus Scoring form in the \"Minimum Qualifications\" section. Copies of proposals rejected by PCS are not distributed to the evaluation team members for evaluation. Proposals that have remaining minimum qualification screening requirements that must be evaluated by program SMEs will be submitted to the evaluation team members (provided PCS's initial review does not result in a disqualification). Minimum qualification determinations will be made by the program area SMEs prior to commencement of th e consensus scoring sessions. 7.12.3.3 Step 3: Individual Review ( Not Scoring) Prior to receiving proposals, evaluation team members should familiarize themselves with the released RFP and all issued amendments and addendums (this includes the Q&A addenda). After p roposals have been received, and with ample time prior to the first meeting of the evaluation team, team members should be given one copy of each proposal to be reviewed. The evaluation members must read and review each proposal. Individual notes should hi ghlight significant points in the proposals (for example, strengths/weaknesses) and note any questions they would like to discuss in the evaluation team meeting(s). The evaluators are not to score the proposals in their individual notes, as the scoring is done by consensus in the group setting. 7.12.3.4 Step 4: Team Evaluation The use of a consensus approach to evaluate the proposals means that evaluation team members will not assign any scores during their individual reviews of the proposals. Instead, the entire ev aluation team will arrive at a consensus as to assignment of points on each evaluation criterion of each proposal during the evaluation team meeting(s). A facilitation team consisting of a facilitator, a scribe, and a CQC analyst will be assigned by PCS an d CQC joint decision. A facilitator must assist the team in developing consensus. The facilitator must not exercise decision -making in the determination of the assignment of points to proposals. Evaluation teams may decide to review proposals by alphabetic al order, random selection or another appropriate method. It is recommended, however, that the evaluation team review and assign points to only one proposal at a time. This approach works best when proposals are reviewed and scored by proceeding through ea ch of the RFP's evaluation criteria in numerical order. After completing the review and assigning points to an entire proposal, the team then moves on to the next proposal, and so forth. Proposals must be evaluated against the criteria of the RFP. The eval uation team must not evaluate or compare proposals to each other except when evaluating for cost. The scribe will keep the only document for recording the team consensus comments and assigned points for each proposal. The document to be used is the Consens us Scoring Rubric. The evaluation team must not assign points for the same factor in more than one evaluation criterion. For example, if the team believes that \"quality assurance\" should be taken under consideration and evaluated under the \"Past Performanc e\" criterion, they should not also evaluate \"quality assurance\" under the \"Demonstrated Approach\" criterion. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 46 7.12.3.5 Step 5: Awarding Points In determining how well a proposal scored, all proposals start off with zero points and are awarded points based on how we ll they responded to the criteria of the RFP. Proposals that exceed the minimum requirements receive higher scores. This approach not only allows for a clear indication of which proposals met the minimum requirements, it also allows for a natural separatio n between outstanding, adequate, and substandard proposals. 7.12.3.5.1 Replacement Scoring Method for Interviews The replacement method uses the interviews consensus scores to replace the written evaluation consensus scores. Interview questions center around clarifyi ng the respondent's written proposal, asking questions to ensure the score for each criterion are addressed. Each respondent must have the same opportunity to address questions related to the solicitation criteria as the other respondents, which means ques tions must be prepared in advance of the interviews. This does not preclude asking follow -up questions to clarify a respondent's answer, or other questions that will not impact the score. Following each oral interview, the evaluation team meets to adjust a nd finalize the Consensus Scoring Rubric . See also, PCS Operating Procedure 543, Secondary Evaluations and PCS Form 544 , Secondary Evaluation Interview Template. 7.12.3.5.2 Combined Scoring Method for all other Secondary Evaluations The combined scoring method adds points to the initial points held by a respondent from the written proposal or the revised interview scores. Secondary evaluation criteria must be developed and identified in the solicitation. Ea ch respondent must have the same amount of time for secondary evaluations. Following each secondary evaluation, the evaluation team meets to score and finalize the Consensus Scoring Rubric . Secondary evaluations will be scored according to the criteria in the solicitation. Options for scoring secondary evaluations are found in PCS Form 550, RFP/RFO Template , PCS Operating Procedure 543, Secondary Evaluations and PCS Form 543, Secondary Evaluation Oral Presentation Site Visit & Demo Template . 7.12.3.6 Step 6: Price Scoring Scoring of the cost proposal information should be in accordance with the RFP. Certain RFPs may require advanced price eva luation, which must be done by the program area. However, most will be done by a CQC financial analyst in the following manner: a. The lowest price proposal will receive the maximum cost points. b. If two or more proposals have the exact same lowest price, then they all receive the maximum cost points. c. Proposals that do not have the lowest price will be assigned points based on the following formula: i. (Lowest submitted cost proposal / Cost of proposal being scored) x (Total cost points available) = Pro -Rated Score Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 47 ii. Example: If 30 points was the maximum to be awarded for price, and the lowest price proposal is $10,000 and the proposal being scored is $14,000, the $14,000 proposal would receive 21.4 points based on the following calculation: iii. ($10,000/$14,000) x 3 0 points = 21.4 points. 7.13 Evaluation Criteria Evaluation criteria are the factors the agency uses to determine which of several competing proposals submitted in response to a solicitation offers the best value for the state and would best meet the agency's needs. 7.13.1 Effective Evaluation Criteria Effective evaluation criteria should result in the following outcomes : a. Provide evaluators with a clear and concise method of identifying the competent offerors; b. Allow the agency to rank the proposals and ultimately select the best value; c. Offer all potential offerors a fair and equitable method of having their proposal reviewed and considered in a consistent and similar manner as their competitors . 7.13.2 Minimum Requirements Screening While evaluation criteria must be published with the solicitation, it is recommended that program staff establish evaluation criteria that clearly identif y factors relevant to the selection of a contractor before drafting the RFx. This ensures that the program is requesting and communicating the most important items - those that lead to vendor selection. The SOW must clearly identify evaluation criteria relevant to the selection of a contractor and must prioritize or weight the criteria according to importance . Evaluation tool criteria and sub-criteria should not contain \"yes\" or \"no\" questions . Yes/no questions are instead exclusively utilized for minimum requirement screening , which is conducted on a pass/fail basis . Minimum requirements are screened by PCS prior to the evaluation , to determine the proposal's eligibility to advance to the evaluation stage . As needed, minimum requirements will also be reviewed by SME s to determine the proposal's eligibility to advance to the evaluation stage ; these requirements may include : a. Financial capacity screening of the respondents' latest financial statements, balance sheets, and/or Dunn and Bradstreet reports, which is conducted by the Financial Services Division; b. Where specialized licenses, certifications, and/or experience are required; and/or various accreditation alternatives are acceptable (e.g., if the minimum requirement states the respondent must be accredited by a CMS -approved accreditation program, the SME will determine whether the respondent's accreditation is by a CMS -approved program); c. In IT procurements where a determination of type of solution or DIR's Texas Data Center Services (DCS) is needed prior to moving on to the written proposal evaluation (e.g., if the solicitation required a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, SME(s) determine whether the respondent's proposed solution is indeed a SaaS or a custom solution); d. Number of years of relevant experience must be reviewed by SMEs that possess knowledge of the specific profession, business, or industry that is required by any minimum qualifications. Purchasers must not conduct this review as they are not familiar with the myriad factors that may make the respondent -provided experience qualify or be acceptable to the program area. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 48 7.13.3 Developing Evaluation Criteria Developing the evaluation criteria should be an extension of the solicitation objective and should align directly with the end user's desired results and expectations. The weight assigned to each evaluation criterion must correlate to its importance. When developing the evaluati on criteria, consider the overall objectives of the procurement and the expected results. Apply relative importance and weight to the criteria accordingly. Generally, cost weights should fall somewhere between 30-40%, and other criteria should not fall below 5% or exceed 30%. The evaluation tool must measure items described in the solicitation, and the evaluation tool must contain a column that contains a reference to the area in the solicitation from which each criterion and subcriterion comes. The chart below illustrates how weights effect numeric scores : Line Item Score using Scoring Guide Line Item Weight and Final 2.00 2.50 1.00 6.00 8.00 12.00 14.00 3 0.30 0.60 0.90 1.20 1.50 3.00 4.50 7.50 9.00 Marginal 15.00 20.00 25% (green columns) are the safer, recommended weights for all criteria and sub- criteria, except for Cost . 7.13.3.2 Not Recommended. Below 5% or exceeding 30% (red columns) are weights that result in too small or too large score variances and are not recommended. These scores are harder to defend, pose a higher risk, and significantly increase the potential for unsuccessful protests. 7.13.3.3 Proceed with Caution. 5% and 30% (yellow columns) m ay be appropriate in certain circumstances with further consideration. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 49 7.13.4 Characteristics of Effective Evaluation Criteria PCS will return ineffective evaluation criteria to the program . For criteria to be effective, they should have the following characteristics: a. Clear : not subject to multiple interpretations, not ambiguous ; b. Relational : all key elements of the project requirements must relate to the requirement definition and be covered by evaluation criteria ; c. Discriminating : separate best, average and weaker proposals ; d. Non -discriminatory : fair and reasonable ; e. Realistic : given the nature or value of the contract ; f. Measurable : must have distinguishing importance ; g. Economical : use of the criteria should not consume an unreasonable amount of time or resources ; and h. Justifiable : makes sense and can be justified on common sense, technical and legal basis; mandatory and heavily weighted criteria must be justified . 7.13.5 Evaluation Criteria Purchase price and evidence that goods and services meet specifications are the principal considerations when goods and services are procured through a competitive process. It is common for there to be three to five evaluation criteria which broadly address the following : a. Respondent's relevant qualifications, experience and past performance (15%) . b. Proposed approach and work plan to meet solicitation requirements (30%) . c. Adequate staffing, organization structure, s ubs, and key personnel to meet solicitation requirements (15% ). d. Proposed Key Personnel's relevant qualifications, experience, and past performance (10%);and e. Cost/Price (30%). Examples of additional and more detailed evaluation criteria may be found in the best value standards found in statute. Best value standards include, but are not limited to, the following: Sections 2155.074, 2155,144, 2156.007, 2157.003, 2254.003, and 2254.027 of the Texas Government Code. 7.13.6 Adherence to Published Evaluation Criteria Failure to adhere to the published evaluation criteria during the evaluation process may result in a protest. Evaluation criteria that were not included in the solicitation will not be used to rank or select responses. For example, if respondents are to receive additional points for possessing a national accreditation, this criterion must be stated in the solicitation so that all the respondents are notified there is an opportunity to achieve a higher score by submitting the appropriate documentation in its response. Likewise, if the national accreditation information was not requested in the solicitation, respondents who fail to demonstrate this accreditation cannot be penalized. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 50 7.13.7 Cost Evaluation Methodology The scoring method used for the cost criterion must be reviewed for each solicitation to ensure it is appropriate for the products and services to be procured. The method for evaluating cost must be determined prior to posting the solicitation. And must provide respondents a fair and equitable method of having their proposal reviewed and considered in a consistent and similar manner as their competitors. Failure to adequately account for the method of evaluating cost prior to posting and failure to do so in a manner supported by law may result in the cancellation of a solicitation. For example , Chapter 2254 of the Texas Government Code requires that qualifications for certain professional services, not price, be considered in selecting a respondent for negotiations. In general, an RFP and an RFO should have approximately 30-40% of its evaluation criteria devoted to cost. Limited exceptions may be made when funding is fixed and the goal is to spend the entirety of the allotted money at the highest possib le benefit (e.g., services are procured to fulfill the terms of grant funding). Exceptions may also be made for indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity ( ID/IQ ) procurements where the solicitation will establish master agreements, and the specific scope is defined in subsequent work orders. For this type of solicitation, a lower weight (possibly 10-20%) is assigned to cost criteria for review of the general rates proposed in the solicitation and a higher (30- 40%) weight to cost criteria when the work orders are reviewed. 7.13.7.1 Cost Evaluation Methods Cost evaluation may be objective, subjective, or a combination of both. All types of cost evaluation are tied to an evaluation criterion that factors into the Respondent's overall score. It is not a pass/fail criterion, but rather tied to a specific percentage of points. The scoring method used to assess the cost criterion must be carefully considered. An objective cost evaluation relies on a quantifiable mathematical formula, rather than independent judgement, to calculate the score. In contrast , a subjective cost evaluation consider s factors such as the appropriateness of the cost metric chosen by the respondent and the impact of any identified assumptions or constraints on the proposed cost. 7.13.7.2 Objective Cost Evaluations Objective cost evaluations allocate the cost criterion points based on the respondents' total proposed cost. It does not involve an examination of the individual cost elements or components that collectively compri se the respondent's proposed total cost. 7.13.7.2.1 When to Use Objective Cost Evaluations Objective cost evaluation methods must be utilized, without exception , when the solicitation does not require respondent's breakdown the individual costs elements or components that collectively comprise the proposed total cost . For example , when the solicitation only requires respondents provide : a. Total cost(s) with no other breakdown; b. All-inclusive unit prices (e.g., durable medical equipment (DME), certificate paper, and/or other commodities); or Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 51 c. All-inclusive hourly rates (e.g., onsite maintenance or repair services) . 7.13.7.2.2 Conducting Objective Cost Evaluations Objective cost evaluations are conducted by the Financial Analysts in the CQC division using the then current CQC formula. The image below illustrates respondents' cost scores assuming 30 maximum available cost points and the following CQC formula: Quantitative Evaluation Score = [ 1 - ((Proposer Price - Lowest Price) / Highest Price)] x Maximum Available Cost Points: Respondent Respondent's Proposed Total Cost Total Cost Scores (assuming 30 max. available cost points) Notes A $65 (lowest) = [1-(($65 -$65)/$100)]x30 = 30 points The respondent with the lowest proposed total cost receives the Maximum Total Cost Points available per the Solicitation. B $100 (highest = [1-(($100 -$65)/$100)]x30 = 19.5 points The respondent with the highest total cost receives the lowest Total Cost score. C $75 = [1-(($75 -$65)/$100)]x30 = 27 points Other respondents receive scores proportional to where their total cost falls between the lowest and highest proposals. For solicitations requesting all-inclusive unit prices and/or all -inclusive hourly rates , use PCS Form 512, Unit Pricing Cost Proposal Template to calculate a total cost for each respondent to provide services using the agency's historical utilization quantities advertised in the solicitation and the respondents' proposed unit prices. Then, allocate available cost points using the calculated total cost for the initial contract term and the applicable CQC formula. Since the optional year extensions may or not be executed, they are not taken into consideration for the allocation of cost points. 7.13.7.2.3 Mitigating the Risk of Unreasonable Priced Proposals In an open competitive procurement process where total cost is one of the evaluation factors and several acceptable and qualified proposals are received, it can be safely assumed that the prices are reasonable as determined by the market conditions, but only if the discrepancy between the proposed prices is not statistically relevant as explained below. In solicitations where there is no breakdown of cost elements that collectively comprise the respondents' proposed total cost, one of the most widely used statistical analysis tool for determining if a particular total cost deviates from Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 52 other responses is to calculate the standard deviation of the respective series of costs. For example, consider a solicitation requiring respondents propose a total cost without breakdown of the cost elements that collectively comprise their proposed total cost; and six respondents who offered the following prices: Respondent Proposed Total Cost Notes A $18M B $19M Highest price C $17M D $16M E $15M F $14M Lowest price, but there are concerns regarding the reasonability of its proposed price (too low) Without any other cost breakdown available, the following is how statistical methods can be used for price reasonableness analysis purposes using the proposed total cost: Calculate the mean (average) of the cost proposals. In this example the average is $16.5 M. Then calculate the standard deviation from this value (using the STDEV function in MS Excel). In our example , the standard deviation is $1.87 M. One method for determining reasonableness objectively provides that all values that fall below one standard deviation from the mean (i.e., $16.5 M - $1.87 M = $14.63M) can be considered as unreasonably low. Consequently, the proposed price of $14 M should be further investigated to determine its reasonableness. Similarly, all values above one standard deviation from the mean (i.e., $16.5 M + $1.87 M = $18.37 M) can be considered unreasonably high. If, for example , Respondent B had been considered for award, then its price of $19 M should be further investigated. Mathematical or statistical calculations alone should not be used as the sole basis for the rejection of a response, but rather as a starting point for further investigating the price reasonableness. If there are significant discrepancies between the prices of bids, propo sals, offers or quotations, the agency should investigate potential causes of such discrepancies (e.g., ensure that the description of the procurement was not vague that could have been misinterpreted by some respondents, and that there were no calculation errors , etc.). When most proposals are grouped within a close price range (e.g., within one standard deviation from the mean) and there are a few outliers (either significantly higher or lower price than one standard deviation), then the offered prices within the close price range may be Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 53 assumed to be reasonable and the outliers may be assumed to be unreasonable. 7.13.7.3 Subjective Cost Evaluations 7.13.7.3.1 Subjective cost evaluations is the element -by-element assessment of the respondents cost proposal to allocate the cost point specified in the solicitation. Subjective cost evaluations examine the individual cost elements and the proposed profit that compri se the respondent's total proposed cost. Depending on the procurement, these elements may vary but generally include labor rates, material costs, overhead or indirect rates, general and administrative expenses (G&A), and profit. For solicitations requestin g detailed cost proposals, use PCS Form 513 , PCS Form 514 , Retrospective Cost Settlement or Prospective Price Determination Template , or customized spreadsheets showing various elements and th e proposed profit that comprise the respondents total proposed cost with sufficient details to permit evaluation. The respondents must include all fixed price fees in the respondents ' cost proposal. Total fees are required by the agency for evaluation and budget purposes, while additional details of rates and costs are required for agencies understanding of the proposed price. Pricing must be based on the requirements of the solicitation and not the respondent's assumptions or exceptions to the solicitation . Assumptions that conflict with the requirements of the solicitation may be cause for the respondent's proposal to be disqualified. 7.13.7.3.2 When to Use Subjective Cost Evaluations Subjective cost evaluation methods must be utilized, without exception, when the so licitation require s respondents break down the individual costs elements or components that collectively comprise the proposed total cost. For example, when: a. Funding is otherwise fixed, and the goal is to spend the entirety of the allotted money at the highest possible benefit . (e.g. Services are procured to fulfill the terms of grant funding and IT projects.) b. The agency requires Respondent s submit a detailed budget rather than true cost points; c. Procurement for professional engineering, architecture, or surveying services under Chapter 2254 of the Government Code where no competing price proposals are submitted in the initial responses and a cost proposal is only solicited from the highest -ranking firm; d. The agency must determine the proposed costs are appropriately aligned with the scope; e. Research and development; f. Sole -source procurements where no competing vendors respondend to the request for proposals or offers; g. One-of-a-kind items for which there is no basis of comparison; or Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 54 h. When change orders are issued to contracts requiring the contractor to do work whose cost can only be evaluated by examining the various cost elements, such as labor, materials, travel ; The use of evaluation criteria, and in particular subjective cost evaluation criteria, must never be used to apply evaluator discretion in a way that unfairly alters final scores of respondents. If an evaluation is not providing for the program area needs because the solicitation was unclear or incomplete, the only option is to cancel and resolicit. Additionally, subjective cost criteria must not be used to provide discretion where the utilization of objective cost criteria is clearly the most appropriate a pproach. The use of subjective criteria may not be allowed, at PCS' discretion, based on the guidelines set forth in th is section. PCS may require cancellation of the solicitation and will reject requests to \"re -calculate\" objective scoring in order to pro vide a different result. Evaluation criteria should provide respondents a fair and equitable method of having their proposal reviewed and considered in a consistent and similar manner as their competitors. 7.13.7.3.3 Conducting Subjective Cost Evaluations Subjective cost evaluations require the selection committee to review and evaluate separate cost elements and proposed profit of: 1. Respondents' costs or pricing data; and 2. Factors necessary to form an opinion as to the degree to which the proposed costs represent what the contract should cost, assuming reasonable economy and efficiency. The committee reviews specific elements of cost, the necessity for certain costs, the reasonableness of the amounts estimated for the necessary costs, the reasonableness of allowances for contingencies, the basis used for allocation of indirect costs, the appropriateness of allocations of particular indirect costs to the proposed contract, and the reasonableness of the total cost or price. Items typically reviewed during the subjective cost evaluation include, but are not limited to: a. General Evaluation: i. To what extent do the respondents proposed pricing schedules, narrative, and cost allocations are complete, accurate, thorough, meet all requirements outlined in the solicitation; and, clearly map the proposed costs to the respondent's work plan and deliverables; ii. Allowability, allocations, and reasonableness of the respondent's proposed costs; iii. Whether proposed costs are in line what reasonably economical and efficient performance should cost; iv. Restraints and requirements imposed by sound business practices, laws and regulations, and terms and conditions of the federal award if outside funding is included; v. The basis and rationale for all respondent proposed costs should be provided as part of its proposal so that the agency can place reliance on the information as current, accurate, and complete; Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 55 vi. Market prices for comparable goods or services for the geographic area. vii. Whet her the proposed costs deviate from established practices and policies regarding the incurrence of costs; viii. To what extent do the respondent's proposed pricing schedules, narrative, and cost allocations demonstrate understanding of federal and state financial requirements; and, clearly demonstrate how the respondent will comply with applicable requirements; ix. Identification of areas requiring further consideration in determining the best value for the State; x. Formulas and math work check. b. Evaluating Labor: i. To what extent does the respondent's cost proposal demonstrate adequate staffing, organization structure, and key personnel to meet the requirements of the solicitation; ii. A time -phased (e.g., monthly, quarterly, etc.) breakdown of labor hours, rates, and cost by appropriate category; iii. The basis of proposed labor rates and classifications including any escalation factors; iv. Type of labor as well as the skill level of the workers (e.g., entry - level, mid-level, senior, etc.) are appropria te for and correspond with the work being accomplished; v. Fringe benefits. E.g. FICA, TUCA, bonuses, retirement, and paid leave. vi. Differences in accounting for uncompensated overtime. (e.g. competitive advantage enjoyed by companies that propose hourly rates based on uncompensated overtime ). c. Evaluating Other Costs: i. Consolidated priced summary of individual material quantities included in the various tasks, orders, or contract line items; ii. The basis for materials pricing (e.g., vendor quotes, invoice prices, or competitive bids); iii. Breakout of all subcontracts and other costs. Complete, properly itemized and supported by sufficient substantiating data to permit evaluation; iv. Upfront and recurring costs are clearly defined andeparate; v. Is the respondent proposing the appropriate kind and quantities of materials, and if the materials are necessary and reasonable; vi. Identify any proposed direct cost that should be classified as an indirect cost; Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 56 vii. Identify any proposed cost(s) that merit special attention because it is uniquely critical to contract performance, of high value, or other reasons; viii. Whether the respondent's proposed travel expenses follow instructions provided in the solicitation and are compliant with applicable state policies; ix. To what extent is profit/fee reasonable and not redundant; whether respondent's proposed contingencies are allowable and reasonable, and respondent provided adequate supporting data; x. Initial costs and recurring fees (e.g., license fees and recurring maintenance fees. To what extent respondent's proposal includes lower initial costs but higher recurring software maintenance fees, resulting in a higher total cost to the agency over the life of the system). 7.13.7.4 Hybrid Objective and Subjective Cost Evaluations Exclusive reliance on objective cost criteria may not be suitable for highly complex procurements. Conversely, exclusive reliance on subjective criteria to allocate costpoints can be difficult to defend. A hybrid using both objective and subjective criteria is a third cost evaluation method available for consideration by the procurement team. Subjective and objective cost weights should be equivalent or no more than 5 points higher for the objective co st. This mitigat es the risk of respond ents underestimating the proposed total cost shown in their response and trying to make it up in amendments during project implementation. Cost (30%) Weight (%) Comments Total Proposed Cost 15 Objective Criteria Scored by CQC Financial Analyst using CQC formula Comprehensiveness of Pricing Schedules. To what extent do the Respondent's proposed pricing schedules, narrative, and cost allocations are complete, accurate, thorough, meet all requirements outlined in the solicitation; and, clearly map the proposed costs to the Respondent's work plan and deliverables. 15 Subjective Criteria Scored by Evaluation Panel with input from Financial and Program SMEs 7.14 Direct Contract Award Method PCS Oper ating Procedure 436 A direct award may be requested using PCS Form 436 , Direct Award Determination when no responsive bids or proposals are received following the posting of a competitive solicitation and completion of initial screening of responses, or a direct award for the professional services of physicians, optometrists and registered nurses Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 57 (see also, PCS Operating Procedure 436, Direct Award Determination ). This may occur under the following circumstances: 7.14.1 Office of Inspector General (OIG) . For OIG only, if HHSC does not receive any responsive bids on a competitive solicitation for the services of a qualified expert to review investigati ve findings as required by Sections 531.102(l) or 531.102(m) of the Texas Government Code, and the number of contracts is not otherwise limited, HHSC may negotiate with and award a contract to a qualified expert on the basis of the contractor's agreement t o set a fee (range or lump -sum), and the contractor's affirmation and the OIG's verification that the contractor has the necessary occupational licenses and experience.48 7.14.2 State Hospitals (SH) and State Supported Living Centers (SSLC ). For SH/SSLC only, if HHSC does not receive any responsive bids on a competitive solicitation for goods or services for a state hospital or state supported living center HHSC must make a determination that competition is not available, and then may negotiate with and award a co ntract to any qualified vendor that meets the requirements of the original solicitation. The contract must be at current market value price and the term may not exceed 5 years.49 7.14.3 Physicians, Optometrists and Registered Nurses. For contracting with physicia ns, optometrists and registered nurses, HHSC may do so without being subject to competitive advertising and proposal evaluation requirements. If the number of contracts is not otherwise limited, HHSC may award a contract to a provider on the basis of the p rovider's agreement to set a fee (range or lump -sum), and the provider's affirmation and agency's verification that the provider has the necessary occupational licenses and experience.50 OIG and SH/SSLC direct awards require a competitive solicitation to f irst be posted, and documentation that no responsive bids were received before the direct award process may be used. Physicians, optometrists and registered nurses ' contracts may be direct awarded immediately without a competitive solicitation posting, fol lowing receipt of an approved PCS Form 436. When requesting a direct award determination approval for physicians, optometrists, and registered nurses, the program area must specify the qualifications and requirements the contractor must meet in the PCS Form 436. The p rogram area must also understand that contracts must be awarded to any interested party that meets these qualifications, including the ability to perform the described services for a set price established in any resulting contract. The following template language is sometimes helpful for program areas when completing the PCS Form 436 : Must be a [ licensed by _ ]. Must have [ x] number of years of experience. Must be able to provide [description of services ]. Contract(s) will be awarded to any interested party that meets these qualifications, including the ability to perform the described services for a set price established in any resulting contract. If the italicized sentence above is not true for the program area, the procurem ent is not eligible for direct award. 7.15 Historically Underutilized Business (HUB) Determination 7.15.1 HUB Goals 48 Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 531.102(m -2). Tex. and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 58 The intent of the HUB Program is to promote full and equal business opportunities for all certified HUBs to remedy disparity in state procurement and contracting . State agencies shall make a good faith effort to utilize HUBs in contracts for construction, services (including professional and consulting services) , and commodity purchases. The HUB program is administered under the legal authority of Chapter 2161 of the Texas Government Code and Texas Administrative Code Title 34, Part 1, Chapter 20, Subchapter D, Division 1. Each state agency shall make a good faith effort to assist HUBs in receiving a portion of the total contract value of all contracts that the agency expects to award in a fiscal year in accordance with the following Texas Statewide HUB Goals: a. 11.2% for heavy construction other than building contracts; b. 21.1% for all building construction, including general contractors and operative builders contracts; c. 32.9% for all special trade construction contracts; d. 23.7% for professional services contracts; e. 26.0% for all other services contracts; and f. 21.1% for commodities contracts. HHS agencies shall make a good faith effort to meet or exceed these goals by contracting directly with HUBs or indirectly though subcontracting opportunities. 7.15.2 HUB Requirements \u2014Solicitation Value of $100,000 or More The agency shall evaluate the solicitation documents , including the SOW , before the agency solicits bids, proposals, offers, or other applicable expressions of interest of contracts with a value of $100,000 or more over the life of the contract , to comply with the agency's good faith effort requirements as stated , Chapter 2161, Subchapter F, of the Texas Government Code regarding subcontracting , and CPA administrative rule (34 TAC \u00a7 20.284 ), which include : a. Prepare and distribute information on procurement procedures in a manner that encourages participation in all state contracts by all businesses; b. Divide proposed requisitions into reasonable lots keeping with industry standards and competitive bid requirements; c. Where feasible, assess bond and insurance and design requirements that reasonably permit more than one business to perform the work; d. Specify reasonable, realistic delivery schedules consistent with the agency's actual requirements; e. Ensure that the specifications, terms, and conditions reflect a state agency' s actual requirements, are clearly stated, and do not impose unreasonable or unnecessary contract requirements; and f. Provide potential bidders with a list of HUBs or instructions on how to effectively locate HUBs on the Centralized Master Bidders List (CMBL) for solicitations . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 59 7.15.3 Determination of Subcontracting Opportunities In addition, for contracting opportunities with a value of $100,000 or more, the agency shall determine whether subcontracting opportunities are probable under the contract. Utilizing the following criteria for determinin g probable subcontracting opportunities: a. Examin e the scope of work to be performed under the proposed contract and determining if it is probable; b. Research the CMBL and other directories identified by the CPA to identify the availability of HUBs to participate in the contract; and c. Review the previous history of similar purchasing transactions within the agency, other state agencies, including institutions of higher education. 7.15.4 HUB Subcontracting Plan (HSP) Requirements If the agency determines subcontracting is probable, the agency will state the probability in each agency's IFBs, RFPs, or other purchase solicitation document with an expected value of $100,000 or more and will requi re a completed HUB Subcontracting Plan (HSP). To initiate this process , the PCS purchaser obtains the required documentation from the program area and submits a copy of the SOW , a copy of the requisition, and a list of probable subcontracting opportunities to include the NIGP codes to the HHSCHUB@hhs.texas.gov mailbox. This request will be assigned a HUB coordinator to assist with the solicitation and ensure the agency complies with HUB requirements as well as the agency's initiatives. Upon review of the submitted documentation, the HUB coordinator works with the purchaser and program area to determine subcontracting probability and completes the PCS Form 406. The completed PCS Form 406 and the correlating HUB solicitation language is provided to the purchaser to incorporate into the solicitation documents. The purchaser will review PCS Form 406 to confirm and verify the NIGP codes for accuracy. If the purchaser concurs, they will execute the PCS Form 406 and save the document in the procurement file. If any changes are made to the solicitation documents that impacts the HUB program (i.e., scope of work, procurement timetable, etc.), the purchaser will notify the HUB coordinator of the change for input or to revise the PCS Form 406. When the solicitation is posted on the ESBD, the purchaser will notify the HUB Coordinator that it is posted, so that the HUB Program Office may facilitate additional marketing efforts to engage the HUB vendor community. 7.16 Determination of Subrecipient, Recipient, or Contractor Relationship To determine appropriate solicitation method and compliance regulations, the determination of a subrecipient, recipient, or contractor relationship is generally made during the planning phase for an RFA, RFP, and RFQ . The determination process involves various stakeholders that may include program staff, legal , and PCS, with the final determination made by the PCS Grants Division . The final determination shall remain consistent throughout the procurement and contract lifecycle. PCS Form 438 , where applicable, must be completed in order to complete the determination process . This is required if you are one of the program areas designated by PCS that requests both procurements and grants. PCS Policy 438, Contractor or Subrecipient Determination must be followed when requesting a determination. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 60 7.17 Planning Exception \u2014Emergency Procurements51 Under SPD's delegated authority, an emergency purchase occurs when the agency must make the procurement quickl y to prevent a hazard to life, health, safety, welfare, or property , or to avoid undue additional cost to the state. Proper procurement planning for anticipated business need is expected. Emergencies occur as the result of unforeseeable circumstances and may require an immediate response to avert an actual or potential public threat or to avoid undue additional cost to the state. Pending expiration of funds does not constitute an emergency. Emergency purchases discussed in this section are different from agency purchases conducted under a Declaration of Disaster by the Governor .52 SPD authority does not extend to purchases made under the Texas Disaster Act of 1975. For procurements under SPD's authority, SPD has delegated to all agencies the authority to make emergency purchases. Notwithstanding this delegation, emergency purchases are subject to SPD's rules and procedures. Upon request, SPD will assist in advising agencies on the proper procedures for emergency purchases, but SPD will not certify the existence of an emergency. The decision to declare an emergency purchase is the sole responsibility of the agency. If an emergency exists, a written determination of the basis for the emergency and for the selection of a particular vendor must be made and approved, using PCS Form 01, and included in the procurement file. Once the PCS Form 01 is completed , the program requester will follow PCS procurement process by completing a requisition and attaching the approved PCS Form 01, the SOW used to obtain a budgetary quote, the budgetary quote, and any other supporting documentation needed for PCS to complete the purchase. Reference Section 9.7 regarding Emergency Procurements , for more detailed HHS procedures regarding emergency purchases. For an emergency purchase of goods or services exceeding $25,000, an agency must send to SPD a full written explanation of the emergency along with other documentation required by SPD. The notification to SPD must be provided via email to spd.policy@cpa.texas.gov as soon as reasonably practical given the nature of the emergency. Notwithstanding the immediate nature of an emergency, all procurements conducted as emergencies should be made as competitive as possible under the circumstances. For situations where a solicitation is not posted to the ESBD, the agency should make a reasonable attempt to obtain at least three informal bids. Emergency purchases greater than $25,000 must be posted to the ESBD; however, the minimum time for posting of the solicitation does not apply to the extent necessary to address the emergency. In addition, emergency purchases are subject to CAT and QAT reviews; expedited reviews are available upon request to these oversight teams. Emergency purchases of goods or services should not exceed the scope or duration of the emergency. 7.18 The Requisition The last step in the procurement planning phase involves the submission of the requisition to initiate a procurement in CAPPS Financial s. At this stage, the customer organization has secured documentation of any program -specific external reviews and approvals and appropriate internal approvals. These program -specific reviews and approvals may be needed from the SAO , Office of Attorney General, DIR, Governor's Office, or other office. One example of a program specific review is when HHSC is required to request participation for review of major health care procurements from the Office of Attorney General .53 Because this activity is 51 See Comptroller's Guide, Emergency Purchases. 52 Tex. Gov't Code 53 Tex. and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 61 specific to the program and doesn't apply to all procurements, the responsibility to obtain and document the reviews and approvals is the responsibility of the customer organization. Once program has submitted the requisition to initiate the solicitation and has been assigned a PCS Purchaser, the customer organization must promptly provide any approval and review documentation to the PCS Purchaser , to ensure the purchaser has the required documentation for a complete procurement file. All HHS procurements are initiated through the submission of a requisition into CAPPS Financials .54 Responses to Wizard55 questions assist determination of the procurement method and requirements. Before PCS can start procurement processing, program management must approve the request in CAPPS and budget check the requisition. At a minimum, all requisitions must include : a. Complete contact information of the requester including full name, email address, and phone number ; and b. A clearly stated \"need by date\" in accordance with Section 7.1 regarding Procurement Lead Times . Other requirements for common procurements are included in the following table. For assistance in submitting a requisition, please contact PCS Customer Service at: PCS_CST_HHSC@hhsc.state.tx.us . Important Note: Requisitions that fail to include completed documents as detailed in the table below are subject to denial by PCS. The procurement process will not begin, and timelines will not be developed without the completion of this documentation. PCS will notify the customer organization of rejections due to incomplete information or documents.

Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 67 Procurement Methods: Solicitations and GrantsProcurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 68 8. PROCUREMENT METHODS Texas law requires that contract awards may only be made to responsive vendors providing best value to the state. The best value standard may vary depending on the procurement method ;56 therefore, public procurement personnel must ensure that the appropriate best value standard is used as the basis for contract award.57 Process es for selecting the appropriate procurement method is illustrated below. 8.1 Texas Disaster Act of 1975 Under Chapter 418 of the Texas Government Code, the Governor may by executive order or proclamation declare a state of disaster if the governor finds a disaster has occurred or that the occurrence or threat of disaster is imminent. The Governor may suspend the provisions of any regulatory statute58 prescribing the 56 Best value standards include, but are not limited to, the following: Guide, Procurement Method Determination.

The requisition must contain a copy of the disaster declaration. 8.2 State and Federal Surplus Property Program The Texas Facilities Commission (TFC) is charged with administering the State and Federal Surplus Property Programs. There are two methods to acquire State Surplus Property : via transfer directly from the surplus agency or from public sales at the Austin storefront . Examples of items commonly available for transfer include office furniture and equipment, vehicles, heavy equipment, trailers, and computer equipment. For information on property available for direct agency transfer, visit the State Surplus Property website for property listings and the Certificate of Acquisition Form. 8.3 Texas Correctional Industries (TCI) Purchases PCS Operating Procedure 410 TCI is a division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) that manufactures goods and services for the purchase by Texas governmental entities, including HHS agencies. Chapter 497 of the Texas Government Code requires that agencies purchase goods made by and services offered by TCI. TCI provides a variety of items which can be viewed at: https://tci.tdcj.texas.gov/ . Most goods offered by TCI are available for purchase through the SPD Texas SmartBuy online ordering system. PCS will process an internal purchase order and send directly to TCI for services and goods that are not available through the SPD online ordering system. 8.3.1 TCI Goods and Services a. Graphics: signs, awards, plastics, laser engraved awards, custom printing, cardboard boxes, folders; b.

Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 70 8.3.2 Exceptions An agency must procure good s and service s from TCI unless : a. TCI grants a waiver ; b. SPD determines that the good or service produced by TCI does not meet the requirements of the agency ; or c. SPD certifies that the good or service can be purchased elsewhere at a lower price after the agency gives TCI final opportunity to negotiate on price.60 8.4 State Use Program The Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) oversees the Purchasing from People with Disabilities Program, commonly referred to as the State Use Program. TWC contracts with a Central Nonprofit Agency, currently WorkQuest (formerly TIBH Industries), to administer the day-to-day operations of the program. WorkQuest partners with Community Rehabilitation Programs (CRP), which employ disabled workers to develop products or provide services for the State Use Program. WorkQuest is the management link between the CRP work centers (e.g., Lighthouse for the Blind), agencies, and TWC. Only products and services approved by TWC qualify as a State Use Program purchase available for agencies to purchase on Texas SmartBuy. In accordance with Human Resources Code, Section 122.008 (see also, Section 2155.138 of the Texas Government Code ), state agencies are required to purchase products and services offered through WorkQuest that meet the requirements and specifications of the agency and that are available within the time specified. Purchases of goods and services from WorkQuest do not require competitive bidding. Purchases of goods from WorkQuest must be purchased through Texas SmartBuy online ordering system . Purchases of services are made through internal purchase orders. Any time the quality of a WorkQuest product or service is deemed unacceptable or failed to meet agency specifications, this information should be reported to WorkQuest and a vendor performance report must be filed with SPD.61 8.4.1 WorkQuest Commodities (Goods) Agencies must purchase commodities (goods) offered by WorkQuest that meet the requirements and specifications of the agency and that are available within the time specified. The purchases for commodities (goods) are required to be entered through the CPA Texas SmartBuy online ordering system by PCS personnel. Purchases for commodities (goods) are not allowed to be processed through the online product catalog available on the WorkQuest website. 8.4.2 WorkQuest Services Agencies must purchase services offered by WorkQuest that meet the requirements and specifications of the agency and that are available within the time specified . The categories of services offered are Outdoor; Indoor; Freight and Logistics; and Office Assistance. 8.4.3 WorkQuest Temporary Staffing Services CPA has an established managed term contract with WorkQuest for purchasing temporary staffing services. WorkQuest contra cts with Peak Performers and Goodwill (at the time of initial publication 60 See Comptroller's Guide, Texas Correctional Industries Purchases. 61 See Comptroller's Guide, The State Use Program. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 71 of this Handbook ) to provide multiple job classifications across the state with negotiated hourly rates. WorkQuest provides Regional Representatives for assistance in obtaining temporary staff. The procedures for obtaining temporary staff is stated on the CPA Managed Contract No. 962-S3 which may be accessed at: http://www.txsmartbuy.com/contracts/view/225 . If no WorkQuest provider can fill the position, the request will be waived, and the positions must be processed through the appropriate solicitation method applicable to the estimated value. 8.4.4 Moving Service Purchases Moving services are provided by WorkQuest. To procure moving services, the HHS agency/program requesting the moving services must submit a requisition for the estimated dollar amount of the move. The assigned purchaser will reach out to WorkQuest to see if they are able to provide the services for this job and request a quote. A site visit may be requested by WorkQuest prior to providing a quote. If WorkQuest is unable to provide services, they will email a waiver. With a waiver from WorkQuest, moving services may be purchased through an informal or formal procurement process and are also available through TXMAS . 8.5 CPA Statewide Contracts 8.5.1 Texas Multiple Award Schedule (TXMAS) Contracts Pursuant to Government Code, Subchapter I, SPD has established Texas Multiple Award Schedule (TXMAS ) contracts. The TXMAS Program adapts existing competitively awarded government contracts to service the procurement needs of state agencies and Texas SmartBuy members. Agencies are not required to use these contracts. Neither consulting services nor professional services (such as engineering and architecture) are offered as part of the TXMAS program in accordance with Chapter 2254 of the Texas Government Code .62 TXMAS contracts are available at http://www.txsmartbuy.com/ . Agencies may utilize TXMAS contrac ts without obtaining delegated authority from SPD to make purchases that exceed $50,000 for goods and $100,000 for services. Prior to purchasing from a TXMAS contract, however, the purchaser must follow applicable procedures to purchase first from TCI, the State Use Program, and the SPD Statewide Term Contracts. For purchases that exceed $25,000, the agency must post the award notice on the ESBD.63 8.5.1.1 Best Value Determination Prior to utilizing a TXMAS contract, the purchaser must conduct a best value determination before issuing a purchase order (PO). a. For purchases with a value of no more than $50,000, the agency may directly award a PO to an SPD TXMAS contractor without submitting a price request to other contractors in the same category. b. SPD recommends that for contracts that exceed $50,000 the purchaser submit a pricing request to at least three TXMAS vendors included in the TXMAS category to 62 Tex. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2155.001(2) , . 63 See Comptroller's Procurement Method - SPD Texas Multiple Award Schedule (TXMAS) Contracts. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 72 which the contract relates or all TXMAS vendors included in the applicable TXMAS category if the category has fewer than three vendors. 8.5.1.2 Negotiations Purchasers may negotiate lower prices when purchasing from a TXMAS contract; however, the TXMAS vendor may not charge a price higher than the price published in the TXMAS contract . A TXMAS vendor may provide a lower price than the price listed in its Texas SmartBuy catalog. For orders above the TXMAS contract maximum PO dollar limit and for offers through a promotional program, the purchaser may negotiate lower prices than those listed in the Texas Sma rtBuy catalog. Lower prices must be noted in the file by the agency , along with the vendor representative's name. The agency must document the description of the good(s) or service(s) for TXMAS purchases and include pricing documentation in the agency's procurement file. 8.5.1.3 Orders Entered on Texas SmartBuy PCS Operating Procedure 410 Purchase orders for TXMAS contracts must be entered through the Texas SmartBuy online ordering system. Only products or services listed in the underlying contract may be purchased from the TXMAS contract, with one exception: incidental , off-schedule items may be purchased as \"best value, open market\" items , provided that they are necessary for product integration or product completeness. The purchasing entity is responsible for ensuring that the quoted price for such incidental items is fair and reasonable. These incidental items may be added to the TXMAS purchase order if they are clearly labeled as \"open market (OM), best value\" items. Incidental items may not exceed $5,000 or 50 percent of the purchase order total, whichever is less. If the pending order includes incidental items that exceed the stated limits, a request may be submitted to SPD for review and consideration of an exception. Exception requests shall be submitted to txmasquote@cpa.texas.gov . The request must include a copy of the complete vendor quote listing all core items and a detailed incidental charge breakdown.64 8.5.2 SPD Statewide Term Contract Purchases SPD establishes Term Contracts (TxSmartBuy Term and Managed) , categorized by commodity/service codes (NIGP Class/Item codes), as a supply source for all state agencies . The term of each contract is determined by SPD. Competitive bidding by state agencies is not required for items purchased from SPD term Contracts. All agencies are encouraged to use Term Contract s whenever possible.65 Contracts are based on historical estimated quantities, specified by SPD, and may be ordered as needed. 8.5.2.1 Required Use of Term Contracts SPD term contracts are required unless: a. The item on contract does not meet the agency's needs; or b. The quantity to be purchased is less than the item or contract minimum order amount; or c. The term contract does not represent best value; or 64 Comptroller's Guide, Procurement Method - SPD Texas Multiple Award Schedule (TXMAS) Contracts. 65 Comptroller's Guide, Term Contracts; 34 TAC \u00a720.220 . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 73 d. The delivery time on the term contract does not meet the delivery need. 8.5.2.2 Justification for Term Contract Not Used If the SPD contract is not used, the requesting agency must include the reason why the item does not meet the need in the procurement file. Agencies are required to utilize term contracts except as set forth above . In such a case, the justification should be documented in the procurement file. 8.5.2.3 PCS Purchaser Responsibilities a. When a requisition is received , the PCS purchaser is responsible for reviewing the specifications to determine if the item is available from a SPD Term Contract http://www.txsmartbuy.com /.If the purchaser finds an item or items on contract that are similar to the items ordered and appear to meet the agency's need, they will ask the requester to consider the contract item(s). b. If the item(s) will meet the agency's need, the purchaser will use the CPA online purchasing system or Texas SmartBuy to complete the purchase order. c. If the item(s) will not meet the agency's need, the purchaser will ask for justification from the end-user and purchase the item(s) under another procurement method. 8.5.3 Managed Term Contracts A \"Managed\" Term Contract requires manual processing of a purchase order (not entered into SmartBuy online ordering system) , and they typically have different pricing structures or may require a quote that is based on a discount percentage due to the need or for regular scheduled deliveries or flexible delivery dates . PCS will process an internal purchase order directly with the SPD Contractor. 8.6 Spot Purchases (Non -DIR) PCS Operating Procedure 442 Procurements for goods and services must, whenever possible, be accomplished through competitive bidding. With the exception of printing services,66 if the total value of the purchase is $10,000 or less, competitive bidding is not required. Dividing purchases to avoid the competitive bidding requirement is expressly prohibited.67 The PCS Purchaser will review all purchasing methods to determine which is applicable to the procurement. Historically Underutilized Business (HUB) vendors will be used to the fullest extent possible and may be provided an opportunity to quote on small purchases. Pursuant to HHS policy, procurements with a total value of $5,000 to $10,000 (including those with a total value of $10,000) require at least one HUB be given the opportunity to respond. Purchases may not be divided into smaller transactions to avoid competition. 66 Tex. Const. art. XVI, \u00a721; purchases for printing must comply with the procedures set forth in the Comptroller's Guide, Printing Services and In -House Copy Centers. 67 Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 2155.132(g) . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 74 9. COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT A competitive bidding procurement method is used when the requirements are clearly defined and described by detailed specifications. For a purchase made through competitive bidding, the solicitation must include the factors other than price that will be considered in determining which bid offers the best value for the state. The purchase price and whether the goods or services meet all specifications are the most important best value considerations. With the exception of printing services, competitive bidding is not required if the total contract value is $10,000 or less. COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT METHODS Method Use When Advantages Disadvantages Invitation for Bids (IFB) Products or services are standardized or uniform . Simple award process . In determining best value , price and whether the goods or services meet specifications are the most important considerations. Defined specifications may be difficult to develop . Does not encourage innovati ve solutions. Negotiations are not allowed if there is more than one qualified bidder.68 Request for Proposal s (RFP)/Request for Offers (RFO) Negotiation s are preferred . Vendor is expected to provide innovative ideas or solutions . Allows customized proposals to meet the same business need . Allows for negotiation s Considerations in addition to price are used to determine best value Procurement lead time is much greater More complex evaluations Request for Qualification s (RFQ) Vendor selection is dependent on the vendor's skills and qualifications . Procuring a professional service in a non- competitive market , typically a medical professional. Price is not a factor until after vendor is selected. Emphasizes the competency and experience of the vendors Vendor selection occurs before price is negotiated Two -step process 68 Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 2155.088 ; 34 \u00a7 20.206(d)(5) . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 75 9.1 Informal Bidding (Non -DIR) PCS Operating Procedure 444 Informal bidding is used when the value of a contract is over $10,000 , but not more than $25,000 , for the life of the contract (i.e., total value of the contract) . The PCS purchaser will provide bid opportunities to vendors active on the CMBL within the National Institute of Governmental Purchasing (NIGP ) class/item designated in the solicitation. The PCS purchaser must solicit bids from a minimum of three (3) active vendors on the CMBL, two (2) of which must be current as a Texas -certified HUB. Purchasers will complete purchases using a consistent and standardized process that allows for the greatest possible competition without posting to the ESBD . HUB vendors will be used to the fullest extent possible and will be provided an opportunity to bid on all purchases. Purchases may not be divided into smaller transactions to avoid competition. Negotiations are not permitted using this competitive bidding procurement method. However, if there is only one qualified bidder then the PCS Purchaser may negotiate with the sole bidder, including price, provided the negotiation does not result in a material change to the advertised specifications.69 Proprietary procurements must also follow all required procedures for proprietary purchases.70 9.2 Formal Bidding (Non -DIR) PCS Operating Procedure 446 An Open Market IFB is a formal written competitive sealed bid method (>$25,000) used to obtain bids from all eligible and active vendors listed on the CMBL within the NIGP class/item for the service or good. If the total value of a solicitation is greater than $25,000, an IFB must be posted on the ESBD. PCS purchasers will complete purchases using a consistent and standardized process that allows for the greatest possible competition. Purchases may not be divided into smaller transactions to avoid competition. Negotiations are not permitted using this competitive bidding procurement method. However, if there is only one qualified bidder , then the PCS purchaser may negotiate with the sole bidder, including price, provided the negotiation does not result in a material change to the advertised specifications. 9.3 Work Order Process PCS Operating Procedure 650 The work order procedure is used when an HHS or DFPS program has identified a need for a specialized service that may fall under awarded work order master contracts. In certain circumstances, work order master contracts may be established after a competiti ve procurement ; these procurements are typically conducted as an RFP or RFQ . After the work order master contracts are established and a specific need has been identified that falls within the awarded master contract scope of work, the work order process w ill be followed to solicit among the pool of contractors who were awarded a master contract. The HHS or DFPS program begins the process by completing a Work Order Request . The work order request describes the services to be provided and the deliverables re quested. Once it is finalized and approved, it is sent to the master contract eligible pool of contractors for a response. The responses received from the eligible pool of contractors are evaluated in accordance with PCS Operating Procedure 650. Responses can be negotiated (i.e., deliverables) , except for p ricing because the master contract has established the pricing related to the services requested. Once all responses are evaluated, the HHS or DFPS program develops a work order agreement, complete s the PCS Form 09 , Work Order Selection Justification , and work order package then routes for approval in 69 Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 2155.088 ; 34 TAC \u00a7 20.206(d)(5) . 70 See Comptroller's Guide, Competitive Bidding (IFBs, Informal Bidding). Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 76 accordance with PCS OP 650 . The HHS or DFPS program works with PCS to execute the work order agreement and enter a requisition for the funding o f the work order p urchase order. For additional information related to the work order procedure and use of the master contracts , send an email to the PCS Services Team Management . 9.4 Information Technology Purchases The Texas Department of Information Resources (DIR) is the state's Information Technology (IT) and telecommunications provider. DIR also oversees the Data Center Services (DCS) program. PCS Purchasers are required to use c ontracts established by DIR to obtain automated information systems (AIS) unless the procurement is subject to an exclusion or exemption. AIS type products and services are associated with computers (automation) or telecommunications systems. Classificatio n codes with an AIS component are noted with an asterisk (*) on the NIGP Commodity Book . Under DIR's statewide procurement authority, DIR establishes and manages master contracts for use by eligible customers. 9.4.1 DIR Statement of Work Review Process State age ncies are required to submit SOWs to DIR for review prior to the submission to a vendor for technology services. SOWs must meet threshold requirements for commodity purchases. DIR has established contracts that prequalify vendors to respond to SOWs across a variety of technology categories, including: a. Deliverables -Based Information Technology Services (DBITS); b. End-User IT Outsourcing Services; c. IT Security Services; d. Cloud Services; e. Comprehensive Web Development; f. Digital Imaging Services; and g. Complex services such as software or hardware customizations, integration, or overall project solutions. The SOW review process has four phases: draft review, preliminary submission, final review, and execution. DIR SOW REVIEW PHASES Participants Phase Steps Agency & DIR DRAFT Review Agencies will submit draft SOWs to DIR for review before offering SOWs to vendor(s). DIR will review the SOWs and consult with the agency as necessary to ensure the scope of the SOW aligns with the master contract being solicited. Comments, findings, and determination (approval/rejection) will be by email for record purposes. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 77 DIR SOW REVIEW PHASES Participants Phase Steps Agency PRELIMINARY Submission The agency will submit the approved draft SOW to appropriate DIR vendors (following procurement thresholds), evaluate responses, and negotiate the final version of the SOW. The agency and vendor will execute their portions of the final SOW. The agency will send the signed version of the SOW to DIR for review. DIR FINAL REVIEW DIR will review the fin al negotiated SOW to ensure it is still within the original scope and, when so, will execute the SOW and return to the agency. Agency EXECUTED Once executed, the agency may issue a purchase order to the vendor. The agency must post the SOW on its website. DIR offers SOW templates on the Statement of Work webpage for the following: 1. End-User IT Sourcing SOW Template 2. IT Staffing SOW Template 3. Cloud Services SOW Template 4. SOW Template for DBITS 9.4.2 Cooperative Contracts DIR manages over 700 master IT goods and services contracts awarded based on state procurement rules using the request for offer method of procurement. Particular types of DIR cooperative contracts (DBITS, IT Staffing Services, Other Telecom Services, and Information Security) and purch asing requirements are set forth below. Agencies are required to purchase IT commodities using DIR's cooperative contracts or must request an exemption. Agencie s may negotiate lower prices when purchasing from a DIR cooperative contract; however, the DIR vendor may not charge a price higher than the price published in the DIR contract. An agency may not enter into a contract to purchase a commodity item through the DIR Cooperative Contracts Program if the value of the contract 's initial term exceeds $10 million unless it is a DIR coordinated bulk purchase. 9.4.3 Bulk Purchasing Initiatives The Department of Information Resources (DIR) offers bulk purchase initiatives for IT hardware, software, and technology services. In accordance with Texas Government Code Section 2157.068, state agencies making purchases under DIR Bulk Purchase Agreements are not bound by competitive requirements or dollar thresholds otherwise required when making IT commodity purchases for hardware, software, and technology services. 9.4.4 Texas.gov Contracts Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 78 Texas.gov is the official website of the State of Texas . It provides portal and payment services for Texas state agencies and local governmental organizations. Services provided through Texas.gov enable citizens to conduct government business in a variety of easy, secure ways. Application services feature proactive reminders and alerts, customized dashboard, and stored transaction and payment history to the online conveni ence of renewing a driver license, vehicle registration, or professional license (along with 1,000+ other services). Texas.gov's payment services solution offers complete transaction management that specifically meet the unique needs of Texas. These services require an interagency or, as applicable, interlocal agreement signed with DIR. 9.4.5 Shared Technology Services Contracts (STS) STS provides full-service access to diverse managed technology. STS utilizes a multi -sourcing service integrator (MSI) to provide a single point of contact for service delivery. 9.4.6 Telecommunication Services Contracts DIR manages telecommunication contracts that facilitate the purchase of voice, data, wireless, video, or Internet services. Agencies are required to procure telecommunication services through these contracts or must request an exemption . DIR's Telecom unit serves state agencies in three ways: a. Capitol complex telephone system (CCTS) - telephone service within the capitol complex ; b. Texas Agency Network (TEX -AN) contracts - a contract portfolio of voice and data services; and c. Other telecom services contracts (one category of DIR cooperative contracts) - multiple contracts offering wireless, conferencing, and managed telecommunication services. 9.4.7 IT Staff Augmentation Contract (ITSAC) IT Staffing Services contracts are one category of DIR Cooperative Contract s that provide for temporary IT staffing augmentation services. Contracted staff render services and are paid on an hourly basis. The DIR ITSAC competitive process is managed through DIR's ITSAC portal. The ITSAC Portal solicits responses from all eligible ITSAC vendors for the selected labor category. This ensures that state agencies will have met all pricing request threshold requirements The customer ITSAC Portal will be used to post solicitation requests, review details related to submitted solicitations, cancel/withdraw solicitation s, review candidates submitted by vendors, award the solicitation , and mark which candidates were interviewed and/or hired. For more information visit DIR's IT Staffing webpage . State agencies are not required to obtain DIR's signature on a resulting purchase order s when using an IT staffing services contract. 9.4.8 Deliverables -Based IT Services Contracts (DBITS) Deliverables -Based IT Services (DBITS) contracts are one category of DIR Cooperative Contract s that provide project -based IT services. These contracts are not used for hourly rate services . DBITS requires acceptance of a Statement of Work (SOW) and authorization for payment of milestone tasks. Agencies must solicit DIR vendors whose contracts meet the required scope written and approved by DIR. For more information, visit DIR's DBITS webpage. DIR DBITS contract categories include: a. Application development; b. Application maintenance and support ; c. Business intelligence and data warehouse; Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 79 d. Enterprise resource planning (ERP); e. Independent verification and validation (IV&V); f. IT assessments and planning; g. Project management; h. IT procurement assistance; and i. Technology migration and upgrade. 9.4.9 DIR Threshold Requirements State agencies are required through Texas Government Code Chapter 2157 to meet bid threshold requirements for IT commodity purchases for hardware, software, and technology services. Thresholds apply to all cooperative contracts including DBITS and ITSAC. DIR THRESHOLDS Procurement Value (Initial Contract Term) Number of DIR Vendors $50,000 or less May award directly to DIR Cooperative Contracts vendor (s) or reseller(s) of choice More than $50,000 but not more than $1 million 3 (or all vendors in a category with less than 3 vendors) More than $1 million but not more than $5 million 6 (or all vendors in a category with less than 6 vendors ) More than $5 million but not more than $10 million State agencies have the option to enter a contract through the DIR Cooperative Contracts program. If using DIR contracts, state age ncies must submit a request for pricing to at least 6 DIR vendors or resellers (or all vendors in a category with less than 6 vendors) Over $10 million May not enter into a contract through the DIR Cooperative Contracts program to purchase a commodity item 9.4.10 DIR Threshold Exemptions DIR threshold requirements do not apply to: a. Contracts procured through the Data Center Services program signed by the contracted vendors (e.g. , Atos, Capgemini and Xerox Corporation) ; b. Agency customer agreements with the Texas.gov program, pursuant to its enabling statute ; and c. Contracts for telecommunications services, such as TEX-AN Services and Managed Services for Telecommunications. All Statements of Work that are being administered through the Data Center Services program as a pass-through expense will be subject to state procurement rules. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 80 9.4.11 DIR Procurement Exemption s If a government entity wants to procure an item through an avenue outside a DIR contract or service (i.e., any Cooperative Contracts, TEX-AN, CCTS, Other Telecom Services, or other program areas such as Texas.gov), the agency must first obtain an exemption from DIR. For more information regarding DIR exemptions, see the DIR website. The site provides information regarding exemptions, including: a. Cooperative Contracts - Blanket Exemptions ; b. Cooperative Contracts - One -Time Exemption ; c. Certification for Purchase through Local Cooperatives ; d. Data Center Services Exemption ; e. Telecom Exemption; and f. Texas.gov Exemption. 9.4.12 HSPs and DIR Cooperative Contracts DIR facilitates the HSP process for the plan and procurement phase of the HUB Contract Management Cycle. It is the responsibility of the procuring agency to comply with the contract formation and contract oversight of the contract cycle. The agency must determine whether the existing HSP posted on the DIR website is sufficient for implementing the scope of work. To facilitate this process, upon issuing the purchase order, the purchaser will notify the HUB Program Office via email to the HHSCHUB@hhsc.state.tx.us mailbox and request a HUB Coordinator to be assigned. The email should contain a copy of the issued purchase order and a copy of the SOW. The HUB Program Office will contact the DIR vendor and request a clarification to verify the subcontracting needs are being met by the contract's HSP. Once the clarification response is received, if any changes will need to occur, the agency must facilitate the HSP amendment request process through DIR and ensure the prime contractor maintains compliance throughout the life of the agency's purchase order/contract. The HUB Program Office will notify the purchaser and program area once the HSP has been established for the contract, so the DIR vendor may proceed with the contract. NOTE : the agency obtains 100% HUB credit for any HUB direct and subcontracting payments from these contracts. 9.5 Printing Services Agencies must utilize SPD approved State Print Shops to competitively procure print services for printing procurements estimated to be $2,500 or more . State Print Shops provide services through interagency contracts with SPD. Examples of what the State Print Shops can provide include design, digital and traditional offset printing, binding, fulfillment, mailing, and other print -related services to agencies. 9.5.1 HHS Print Shop When an HHS program has identified a printing need, all print requests, including newsletters, forms, brochures, business cards, and letterhead, will be sent to the HHS Print Shop first, prior to entering a CAPPS requisition, using the online print order form , Form D-8. The HHS Print Shop will determine if the print job can be completed in-house ; a requisition will not be required. HHS Printing Services functions on a cost-recovery basis, much like a commercial print shop. When the print job is complete, costs are calculated, and a Cost Report is forwarded to the requester 's agency fiscal department. A summary of charges is sent to the fiscal department each month with a request for payment using an Interagency Transaction Voucher (ITV). Payment is due within 30 days of the invoice date. For further information, see Billing . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 81 If the request cannot be completed by the HHS Print Shop, the HHS Print Shop will submit the request using the CPA SPD Print Shop Job Request Form , which sends the request to all contracted State Print Shops for printing jobs that exceed $2,500. The HHS Print Shop will enter a CAPPS requisition on your behalf and will include the Print Shop Portal request, all responses, the bid tabulation and notification to CPA, and the print shops award to be included for the procurement file. PCS will process the requisition and submit the order to one of the State Print Shops. If one of the State Print Shops cannot fulfill the order , see Section 9.5.2 regarding Print and Print -related Requests Not Available Through State Print Shop (Exceeding $2,500). If the printing request is under $2,500, requests can be sourced directly from any of the contracted State Print Shops. HHS Programs may submit the print request by completing the CPA SPD Print Shop Job Request Form , only if the HHS Print Shop is not able to provide in-house services. To submit specifications to the State Print Shops for bid, HHS personnel must complete the Print Shop Job Request Form. Once completed, click on the submit button on the bottom of the form and the form will be routed to the contacts at each of the State Print Shops. Once the Print Job Request is submitted, the agency must print or save a copy of the results page for the procurement file. The Print Shop Job Request Form provides the HHS personnel with an opportunity to enter the \"Project Due Date,\" the \"Estimate Needed by,\" and the \"Time Needed by\" fields for their job. State Print Shops that can perform the work and respond to the request will reply by the date and time provided on the form. For print purchases, TCI must be given the final opportunity to meet or beat the lowest price. This process must be followed by whomever \u2014 either HHS Print Shop or HHS Program \u2014 submitted the portal request through CPA SPD Print Shop Job Request form. If TCI submitted a bid and TCI is not the lowest bid, the HHS personnel are required to request a final bid from TCI. Do not disclose the other bids to TCI during this stage of the competitive bid process. Upon award, the completed bid tabulation noting the successful bidder should be sent to all State Print Shops and SPD with the email subject line: \"Print Bid Tabulation for Requisition No XXX.\" This will notify all State Print Shops. It is a violation to intentionally divide job request to avoid these proce dures. 9.5.2 Print and Print -related Requests Not Available Through State Print Shop (Exceeding $2,500) 9.5.2.1 Specifications and Estimated Price If the above process is completed and all State Print Shops submit a no bid or no response, HHS Print Shop will enter a requisition , or if HHS program entered the CPA SPD portal request, HHS program will enter a requisition and attach documentation to show that the State Print Shop request was made and was unsuccessful. HHS program should determine their print job specifications and estimated purchase price for their print job. The initiating HHS personnel should provide details of their needs, including: a. Department name and department identification number; b. Description of the needed printing, including quantities, type stock, special assembly instructions, and other relevant information; and c. Required delivery date. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 82 9.5.2.2 Purchases less than $5,000 A quote will be obtained from commercial vendors and a purchase order will be issued. 9.5.2.3 Purchases between $5,000 and $10,000 The purchaser will locate at least one HUB vendor on the CMBL and a suggested vendor, if requested. A purchase order will be issued to the vendor with the best value to the stat. 9.5.2.4 Purchases over $10,000 A solicitation will be completed (traditionally an invitation for bid). Please allow time for processing according to dollar threshold and procurement method. ESBD posting requirements apply to printing services contracts that will exceed $25,000. For more information, see State Print Services and HHS Templates . 9.6 Conference and Meeting Room Space 9.6.1 Prohibitions and Requirements Acco rding to Section 2113.106 of the Texas Government Code , state agencies must use state -owned or state -occupied facilities for meetings, conferences, and administration of group examinations and may not use appropriated money to lease private facilities for these purposes unless state facilities are: a. Not available when needed; b. Not adequate to accommodate the meeting, conference, or examination; or c. Not an economically favorable alternative to other facilities. 9.6.2 Process for Obtaining Conf erence or Meeting Room Space The HHS agency or program requesting the purchase of conference or meeting space determines space rental needs, general location, and the potential cost for the purchase. If HHS agency staff contact vendors for estimated costs of their conference or meeting space needs , agency staff must clearly explain to all contacted vendors that the price estimate is sought for informational purposes only and that the agency's request for an estimate is not a formal solicitation . When obtaining price estimates from vendors, care must be taken to avoid giving any vendor any competitive advantage in a future procurement initiative.71 HHS agency staff must not reserve space or sign contracts with hotels or private facilities for conferences or meeting space. Only PCS staff are authorized to enter into space rental contracts or agreements that are obtained through the PCS procurement process. HHS agency staff must check for availability of state -owned or state -leased space in the general location in which the meeting space is needed. HHS agency staff must use the Texas Facilities Commission Conference Room Reservation Portal to determine if state space is available that will meet the agency's need. If space and availability do not meet the agency's needs, a copy of the reservation portal calendar search must be saved and attached to the requisition. Additionally, the requesting agency must document at least one of the criteria in Section 9.6.1 when filling out the Hotel Conference Space requisition section of the CAPPS Financials Wizard when entering a CAPPS Financials requisition. If competitive bidding is required, bids are obtained, and the requester is consulted to confirm the winning bid meets the requester's needs. If a formal procurement is required, appropriate formal procurement process will be used. 71 Comptroller's Guide, Informal Budget Quotes. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 83 If a hotel or conference facility requires an HHS agency to agree to certain terms or conditions for use of their space and negotiations are permitted under the procurement method used , the conditions will be reviewed and approved by PCS and, if required, System Contracting. If approved, PCS attaches the approved terms and conditions provided by System Contracting to the purchase order. PCS issues a purchase order and provides a copy to the hotel/facility and the requesting entity. 9.7 Emergency Procurements PCS Operating Procedure 400 An emergency purchase occurs when the agency must make a procurement quickly to prevent a hazard to life, health, safety, welfare, or property or to avoid undue additional cost to the state . An emergency purchase is not a tool for avoiding proper procurement planning. The pending expiration of funds does not constitute an emergency. An emergency occurs as the result of unforeseeable circumstances and may require an immediate response to avert an actual or potential public threat or to avoid undue additional cost to the state . A written determination of the basis for the emergency and for the selection of a particular vendor must be included in the procurement file. Excerpt from the Comptroller's Guide:72 Note: Emergency purchases discussed in this section are different from agency purchases conducted under a Declaration of Disaster by the Governor. SPD authority does not extend to purchases made under the Texas Disaster Act of 1975. Refer to Procurement Method - Texas Disaster Act of 1975. For procurements under SPD's authority, SPD has delegated to all agencies the authority to make emergency purchases . Notwithstanding this delegation, emergency purchases are subject to SPD's rules and proce dures. Upon request, SPD will assist in advising agencies on the proper procedures for emergency purchases, but SPD will not certify the existence of an emergency . The decision to declare an emergency purchase is the sole responsibility of the agency. If an emergency exists, a written determination of the basis for the emergency and for the selection of a particular vendor shall be included in the procurement file. For an emergency purchase of goods or services exceeding $25,000, an agency must send to SPD a full written explanation of the emergency along with other document ation required by SPD. The notification to SPD must be provided via email to spd.policy@cpa.texas.gov as soon as reasonably practical given the nature of the emergency. Notwithstanding the immediate nature of an emergency, all procurements conducted as emergencies shoul d be made as competitive as possible under the circumstances. For situations where a solicitation is not posted to the ESBD, the agency should make a reasonable attempt to obta in at least three informal bids. Emergency purchases greater than $25,000 must be posted to the ESBD; however, the minimum time for posting of the solicitation does not apply to the extent necessary to address the emergency. In addition, emergency purchases are subject to CAT and QAT reviews; expedited reviews are available upon request to these oversight teams . Emergency purchases of goods or services should not exceed the scop e or duration of the emergency. 9.7.1 Emergency Purchase Justification If the purchase is over $10,000 , the requesting agency must document and justify the emergency purchase by completing PCS Form 01, Justification for Emergency Purchase s. Approval must be provided by either the requesting agency's commissioner or commissioner designee by signing PCS Form 01. 72 Comptroller's Guide, Emergency Purchases. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 84 9.7.2 HUB Requirements for Emergency Procurements In accordance with Section 2155.137(b) of the Texas Government Code , emergency procurements are required to contain all the same HUB requirements as all other procurements. It is important to have the HUB program involved as soon as the procurement is identified as an emergency, so that HUB can work with the program area and purchaser to ensure the agency complies with statute and rules in submission of the HUB Subcontracting Plan (HSP) , when subcontracting is probable . Generally, the respondent is required to provide HUBs and trade organizations or development centers seven working days to respond to the required subcontracting notice.73 In emergency procurements, the agency has the flexibility to determine a different time period, as required by the circumstances . The procurement file must be documented, and the pre-determined reduced timeframe must be clearly stated in the solicitation documents.74 Respondents may also utilize any of the other four available good faith effort methods to submit a responsive HSP other than the solicitation method mentioned above. 9.8 Proprietary Purchases PCS Operating Procedure 401 A proprietary purchase is one where the specifications or conditions of the proposed purchase are proprietary to one vendor and do not permit an equivalent product or service to be supplied.75 The term \"proprietary\" refers to a product or service that has a distinctive feature or characteristic which is not shared or provided by competing or similar products or services. Because Texas procurement law promotes the use of competitive bidding for purchases, proprietary purchases are subject to enhanced scrutiny. 9.8.1 Competitive or Sole Source Proprietary purchases may be either sole source or competitive: a. Sole Source: The specified product or service is only available for purchase through a single vendor (e.g., manufacturer, publisher, service provider ). Examples of sole source proprietary purchases include a back issue of a magazine available from only the publisher and an educational conference available from only the conference sponsor. b. Competitive: The specified product or service is available for purchase through more than one vendor (e.g., dealers, distributors, resellers, authorized service providers ). Examples of competitive proprietary purchases include brand -specific replacement parts for equipment available through multiple OEM -authorized dealers and software that a software publisher makes available to the public through several resellers.76 9.8.2 Proprietary Purchase Justification Proprietary purchases require a completed PCS Form 02, Proprietary Purchase Justification , in the procurement file. The Proprietary Purchase Justification form must include the following information in order to document best value to the state: a. Describe the product or service the agency proposes to purchase, and provide a statement regarding the agency's business need and planned use; b. Explain why the agency specifications for the product or service are written as they are, and why those specifications are necessary to accomplish the agency's goal for the procurement; 73 34 TAC \u00a7 20.285(d) 74 \u00a7 2155.067(a) . Guide, Proprietary Purchases. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 85 c. State the reason that no other competing products or services will satisfy the need of the agency and provide examples of the technical, practical, or operational risks that would occur if competing products or services are selected; and d. Specify whether the purchase is sole source or competitive. The PCS Form 02 mus t be signed by the agency head or a person to whom such signature authority has been properly delegated in the Agency Procurement Plan. 9.8.3 General Procurement Requirements Proprietary purchases, regardless of whether they are sole source or competitive, are subject to ESBD posting requirements , as well as requirements applicable to SPD delegation, CAT reviews, and QAT reviews. 9.8.4 HUB Requirements for Proprietary Procurements State agencies are required to make a good faith effort to assist historically underutilized businesses (HUB) to receive a portion of the total contract value that an agency expects to award in a fiscal year in accordance with statewide HUB goals4. Proprietary purchases, administrative or clien t related, are not exempt from this requirement. Any procurement with an expected contract value of $100,000 or more must be reviewed by a HUB coordinator to determine whether there will be subcontracting opportunities under the contract. If the HUB coordi nator determines there are subcontracting opportunities, a HUB subcontracting plan (HSP) is required. If an HSP is required, the solicitation response must contain a plan to be considered responsive. 9.9 Consulting Services Contracts PCS Operating Procedure 576 Agencies are permitted to contract for consulting services pursuant to Chapter 2254, Subchapter B of the Texas Government Code . a. \"Consulting service\" means the service of studying or advising a state agency under a contract that does not involve the traditional relationship of employer and employee.77 b. \"Major consulting services contract\" means a consulting services contract for which it is reasonably foreseeable that the value of the contract will exceed $15,000 , or $25,000 for an institution of higher education other than a public junior college .78 9.9.1 Major Consulting Services Special Procedural Requirements Chapter 2254 of the Texas Government Code, includes strict procedural requirements for major consulting contracts that if not followed will render such a contract void.79 A major consulting services contract requires a finding of fact issued by the Governor that the services are necessary .80 Unless an emergency waiver is obtained from the Governor ,81 a major consulting services contract requires a finding of fact issued by the Governor that the services are necessary and cannot be performed by the agency with its own staff . Additional procedural requirements include conflict of interest provisions and restrictions on contracting with former employees. 77 Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 2254.021(1) . and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 86 A state agency may contract with a consultant only if there is a substantial need for the consulting services; and the agency cannot adequately perform the services with its own personnel or obtain the consulting services through a contract with a state governmental entity.82 In selecting a consultant, a state agency must base its choice on demonstrated competence, knowledge, and qualifications and on the reasonableness of the proposed fee for the services; and if other considerations are equal, give preference to a consultant whose principal place of business is in the state or who will manage the consulting contract wholly from an office in the state.83 9.9.2 Notice of Intent and Finding of Fact Notice of Intent to enter into a major consulting services contract must be given by the agency to the LBB and the Governor's Budget and Planning Office before entering into such a contract . A contract may not be entered into prior to the issuance of a finding of fact by the Governor, or, in the event of an unforeseen emergency, a limited waiver has been issued by the Governor. An \"unforeseen emergency\" is a situation that suddenly and unexpectedly causes a state agency to need the services of a private consultant including the issuance of a court order, an actual or imminent natural disaster, and new state and federal regulations. 9.9.3 Solicitation Advertis ement Not later than the 30th day before the date it enters into a major consulting services contract, a state agency must post in the electronic state business daily (ESBD) under Section 2155.083 of the Texas Government Code : a. an invitation for consultants to provide offers of consulting services; b. the name of the individual who should be contacted by a consultant that intends to make an offer; c. the closing date for the receipt of offers; and d. the procedure by which the state agency will award the contract .84 If the services relate to services previously provided by a consultant, the agency must disclose that fact in the invitation for offer. If an agency intends to award the contract to a consultant that previously provided the services, unless a better offer is received, the agency must disclose the intention in the invitation for offer (The invitation for offer will be procured using the RFP procurement method.) 85 9.9.4 Post Award Requirements a. Not later than the 30th day after entering into a consulting services contract if the amount of the contract, including an amendment, modification, renewal, or extension , exceeds $50,000 , written notice of award shall be provided to the Legislative Budget Board on a form prescribed by the LBB.86 b. After the contract is awarded, a notification of award must be posted to the ESBD if the contract is expected to exceed $25,000.87 82 Tex. Gov't Code and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 87 c. Pursuant to Section 2254.036(b) of the Texas Government Code, copies of all documents, films, recordings, or reports compiled by the consultant shall be filed with the Texas State Library . Pursuant to HHS Policy, the HHSC Records Management Division files the applicable documents with the Texas State Library . d. Pursuant to Texas Government Code, Section 2254.036(a), on request, a state agency shall, after the agency's contract with a consultant has ended, supply the LBB and the Governor's Budget and Planning Office with copies of all documents, films, recordings, or reports compiled by the consultant under the contract. 9.9.5 Renewal , Amendment, and Extension A state agency that intends to renew, amend, or extend a major consulting services contract shall comply with Sections 2254.028 (notice of intent and finding of fact) and 2254.029 of the Texas Government Code (ESBD under Section 2155.083 of the Texas Government Code) , if the contract after the renewal, amendment, or extension is a major consulting services contract .88 A state agency that intends to renew a contract that is not a major consulting services contract shall comply with Sections 2254.028 and 2254.029 of the Texas Government Code , if the original contract and the renewal contract have a reasonably foreseeable value totaling more than $15,000.89 A state agency that intends to amend or extend a contract that is not a major consulting services contract shall comply with Sections 2254.028 and 2254.029 of the Texas Government Code , if the original contract and the amendment or extension have a reasonably foreseeable value totaling more than $15,000.90 9.9.6 Emergency Waiver The Governor, after receipt of a request complying with Section 2254.025 of the Texas Government Code , may grant a limited waiver of the provisions of Chapter 2254, Subchapter B, of the Texas Government Code, for an agency that requires consulting services before compliance with Subchapter B can be completed because of an unforeseen emergency. As soon as possible after the Governor grants a limited waiver , a state agency shall comply with Subchapter B to the extent that the requirements are not superfluous or ineffective because of the waiver. The agency shall include with information filed with the secretary of state for publication in the Texas Register a detailed description of the emergency on which the request for waiver was predicated. In Section 2254.025 of the Texas Government Code , \"unforeseen emergency\" means a situation that suddenly and unexpectedly causes a state agency to need the services of a consultant. The term incudes the issuance of a court order, an actual or imminent natural disaster, and new state or federal legislation. An emergency is not unforeseen if a state agency was negligent in foreseeing the occurrence of the emergency. 9.9.7 Mixed Contracts Chapter 2254, Subchapter B, of the Texas Government Code, applies to a contract that involves both consulting and other types of services if the primary objective of the contract is the acquisition of consulting services.91 9.9.8 Distribution of Consultant Reports 88 Tex. Gov't . and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 88 A consulting services contract must include provisions that allow distribution of the consultant report or to post the report on the HHS website or the website of a standing committee of the legislature. 9.10 Request for Proposal (RFP) PCS Operating Procedure 571 State agencies are required to purchase goods and services that provide the best value for the state. For a purchase made by RFP, the agency must specify in the solicitation the known factors other than price that the agency will consider in determining which proposal offers the best value for the state. The agency must award the contract to the respondent whose proposal offers the best value for the state, considering price, past vendor performance, vendor experience or demonstrated capability, and any other evaluation factors in the RFP. PCS Purchasers and managers are responsible for facilitating the procurement process for RFPs. In order to certify the procurement and award process, PCS purchasers should function as the primary contact for each step of the process, from solicitation development through contract award. All agencies, including HHSC and those agencies that HHSC supports regarding purchasing \u2014 DSHS, DFPS, and TCCO \u2014 must obtain delegation of purchasing authority from the CPA SPD, Procurement Oversight & Delegation (POD) team (for services) or the Open Market Review process (for goods), except for the following procurements: a. Consulting services; b. Professional services; c. Health care services; d. Information resources technology; e. Goods or services acquired for the benefit of or on behalf of clients of programs operated by HHSC, DSHS, or DFPS; f. Procurements specifically HHSC, DSHS, or DFPS by statute; g. Contracting out agency purchasing functions or other administrative/program functions; h. Goods and services related to construction projects for state hospitals and state supported living centers; i. Deferred maintenance projects for state hospitals and state supported living center ; and j. Any other procurements for which the contracting agency has been granted procurement auth ority by statute. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 89 9.11 RFP Construction PCS Operating Procedure 571C RFPs for construction procurements made under the authority of Chapters 2156 and 2269 of the Texas Government Code utilize an independent RFP template developed specifically for construction procurements. 9.11.1 HHSC Maintenance and Construction (M&C) Division Construction procurements support the HHSC M&C Division, and can be advertised under both Chapter 2156 and Chapter 2269 of the Texas Government Code: a. Chapter 2156 of the Texas Government Code does not include the State of Texas Uniform General Conditions and is generally used for procurements under $100,000.00. b. Chapter 2269 of the Texas Government Code includes the State of Texas Uniform General Conditions and is generally for procurements over $100,000.00 . 9.11.2 Types of Construction Projects Construction procurements made under the authority of Chapter 2156 and Chapter 2269 of the Texas Government Code include: a. New building and site construction; b. Renovation of existing structures and site conditions; c. Deferred maintenance; d. Repairs to faciliti es and equipment; and e. Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple award contracts in various disciplines. 9.12 Request for Qualifications (RFQ) PCS Operating Procedure 570 PCS purchasers and managers are responsible for facilitating the procurement process for RFQs. In order to certify the procurement and award process, PCS purchasers should function as the primary contact for each step of the process, from identification of the need(s) to contract award and ensure the requested procurement meets the definition of professional services as set out in statute. 9.12.1 Professional Services The RFQ is the commonly used procurement method to procure professional services . Professional services refer to services that are: a. Within the scope of the practice, as defined by state law, of accounting, architecture, landscape architecture, land surveying, medicine, optometry, professional engineering, real estate appraising, or professional nursing; b. Provided in connection with the professional employment or practice of a person who is licensed or registered as one of the following: a certified public accountant, an architect, a landscape architect, a land surveyor, a physician, including a surgeon, an optometrist, a professional engineer, a state certified or state licensed real estate appraiser, or a registered nurse; or Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 90 c. Provided by a person lawfully engaged in interior design, regardless of whether the person is registered as an interior designer under Chapter 1053 of the Occupations Code.92 The RFQ method may also be utilized to procure legal or consulting services , although utilization of an RFP is far more common . Reference Section 9.9 regarding Consult ing Services Contracts , and contingent fee legal services.93 9.12.2 Audit Services (Requires SAO Delegation) Section 321.020 of the Texas Government Code specifies that a state agency , or corporation that is dedicated to the benefit of a state agency , may enter into a contract for audit services only if: a. The agency or corporation is authorized to contract with a private auditor through a delegation of authority from SAO; b. The scope of the proposed audit has been submitted to SAO for review and comment; and c. The services of the private auditor are procured through a competitive selection process in a manner allowed by law. The Compliance Division within the HHS Office of Audit and Compliance is the designated central point of contact, with the SAO, for obtaining authority to procure audit services. Program area s must coordinate with the Compliance Division to obtain a delegation of authority to procure audit services prior to contracting for the audit services. The RFP method may also be used to procure audit services, although utilization of an RFQ is the preferred method. 9.13 Drafting the Solicitation A solicitation will be required for a competitive procurement . Drafting of the solicitation begins with program development of specifications or scope of work. The process involves collaboration between the program area, PCS, Budget, IT, System Contracting , CQC and other key stakeholders. It is imperative the solicitation is written in a manner that attracts responses that meet the program area's business need. Examples of solicitation templates are available in the CAPPS template library. 9.14 Specification Drafting Clear, concise, detailed specification drafting is very important for all solicitations. Lack of clarity can lead to non-responsive results as well as other issues . All participants involved in the procurement process must ensure that specifications provide all potential respondents an equal and fair opportunity to submit a proposal for evaluation and are not intended to favor any particular respondent. A specification is a description of a product or service the agency seeks to procure and is also what the vendor must offer to be considered for contract award. The most common types of specifications used in government procurements are: a. Performance -based; b. Design -based; or c. Mixed (i.e., a comingling of both performance - and design -based specifications). 92 Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 2254.002(2) ; see also, Comptroller's Guide, Procurement Method - Professional Services. 93 Tex. Gov't Code ch. 2254, subch. C . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 91 9.14.1 Performance -based Specifications Performance -based specifications focus on outcomes or results rather than the process by which the products and services are produced. Respondents bear the burden of choosing the approach that will be utilized to accomplish the agency requirement. Performance -based specifications allow respondents to bring their own expertise, creativity, and resources to satisfy the agency requirement. Program staff must ensure that performance -based specifications are reasonable and measurable. 9.14.2 Design -based Specifications Design -based specifications focus on how the vendor must perform the service or how the product is made rather than what the product or service does. Respondents have very little discretion as to the methods or detailed processes to be used. Program staff must ensure that processes are in place to properly inspect and test for compliance with the specifications. 9.14.3 Descriptive Specifications \u2014 Referenced Brand or Equivalent Descriptive specifications (referenced brand or equivalent) for products must provide those principal physical, functional or other characteristics that are essential to the minimum business needs while providing open and competitive bidding. The specifications should not include minimum or maximum restrictive dimensions, weights, materials , or other characteristics that are unique to one brand name or would eliminate competition of other products. As a best practice, a minimum of two known acceptable manufacturer/brand names and model numbers that are currently being manufactured should be referenced as \"or equal.\" The solicitation should include a clause citing the purpose for the references as \"or equal\" and the submittal requirements for evaluation. For example, a solicitation clause for a referenced brand is as follows: \"Catalogs, brand names, or manufacturer's references are descriptive only and indicate type and quality desired. Bids on brands of like nature and quality will be considered. If proposing other than the referenced brands/model number, Bidder must provide the manufacturer, brand, or trade name, product number, and provide complete descriptive information of product offered and include it with the bid.\" The evaluation of \"or equal\" offers shall be given full consideration and offers meeting the specification shall not be rejected for minor differences in design, construction, or features from the reference models that do not affect the suitability of the product for its intended use. 9.14.4 Restrictive Specifications Restrictive specifications have the potential to limit competition. Program staff must be careful not to inadvertently customize a product or service when drafting specifications. As an example, consider an agency purchase of 4-inch resealable bags when the agency's business need could be satisfied with the industry standard of a 5-inch resealable bag. In this scenario, the agency requirement of a non-standard bag size will reduce the eligible vendor pool to only those vendors capable of providing the customization , as well as result in increased cost to the state due to the customization. Regardless of whether the specification is performance -based, design -based, or mixed, restrictive specifications that result in proprietary procurements are not permitted unless the procedures for Proprietary Purchases are followed. See PCS Operating Procedure 401. Again, restrictive descriptive characteristics that are essential to the intended use may be included only if all the manufacturer/brands referenced in the solicitation can qualify. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 92 9.15 Entering a Requisition for an RFx or IFB Procurement In order to submit a requisition for an RFx or IFB procurement, the following documents must be attached to the requisition . Requisitions entered that fail to include completed documents as detailed below are subject to being denied by PCS, and customer organization leadership being notified. The procurement process will not begin, and timelines will not be developed, without the completion of this documentation. 9.15.1 Completed Scope /Statement of Work Program areas can fulfill this requirement by submitting a draft RFx or IFB in the current template with the SOW section completed. The requisition may be denied if the SOW does not contain all the required components as detailed in the applicable RFx or IFB template. 9.15.2 Accurate Request Document Answers to the CAPPS Financials Request Document Wizard are utilized to automatically complete the request document , which accompanies the requisition. If answer s are incorrect or incomplete, the requisition must be completely denied, and it must re-route through the approval process. 9.15.3 Contract Value Contract value is the most common mistake on the request document , and always requires re- routing for approvals because approvals vary at different contract values. Remember, the value of the contract is the value of the initial term plus all renewals. (Example: If the initial contract term is one-year at $100,000, plus three (3) one-year renewals , the contract value is $400,000.) 9.15.4 Determination for RFx PCS Form 438, where applicable, must be completed in order to determine whether the resulting award will operate under a subrecipient or contractor relationship. This is required if you are one of the customer organizations designated by PCS that requests both procurements and grants . Reference Section 11.2 regarding Determination of Subrecipient, Recipient, or Contractor Relationship Process. 9.15.5 Procurement Risk Assessment The Procurement Risk Assessment ( PCS Form 14 8) must be completed and attached to the requisiti on. For RFx (i.e., RFP, RFO, RFA, RFQ) procurements, the form is reviewed and approved with all attendees at the kick -off meeting . For IFBs, program staff and PCS Purchaser must discuss and approve the form . Once approved, the PCS Purchaser must incorporate the form into the procurement file. 10. NON-COMPETITIVE CONTRACTS, AGREEMENTS , AND OPEN ENROLLMENTS 10.1 Non -Competitive Contracts and Agreements 10.1.1 Interagency Contracts \u2014the Interagency Cooperation Act The Interagency Cooperation Act, Chapter 771 of the Texas Government Codeprovides that a state agency may agree to contract with another state agency for the provision of necessary and authorized services and resources. An interagency contract (IAC) entered into pursuant to Chapter 771 must specify: a. The kind and amount of services or resources to be provided; b. The basis for computing reimbursable costs; and Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 93 c. The maxi mum cost during the term of the contract. All IACs must be approved by the administrator of each agency that is a party to the contract . HHS agencies contract with many other state agencies to carry out the duties of the HHS programs. In addition, HHSC itself relies on a number of other state agencies to procure services either as required by statute, such as telephone and certain information technology services, or because in many cases it results in significant cost savings. IACs are based on reimbursable costs and do not include additional costs or mark -ups for profit. IACs may include memorandums of agreement, memorandums of understanding, and letter agreements. There are special prohibitions related to IACs with institutions of higher education . Pursuant to Section 51.955 of the Texas Education Code, a state agency that expends appropriated funds may not enter into a research contract with an institution of higher education if the contract includes a provision precluding public disclosure of any final data generated or produced in the course of executing the contract unless the agency reasonably determines that the premature disclosure of such data would adversely affect public safety, the protection of intellectual property rights of the institution of higher education , publication rights in professional scientific publication , or valuable confidential information of the institution of higher education or a third party. 10.1.2 Interlocal Contracts \u2014 the Interlocal Cooperation Act Interlocal cooperation contracts are agreements between a state agency and a local government al entity or between two or more local government al entities , such as cities or counties. Such contracts are authorized and regulated by the Interlocal Cooperation Act, Chapter 791 of the Texas Government Code , and generally relate to the provision of governmental functions and services. The statute should always be consulted for specific authority and requirements. However, generally, an interlocal contract must: a. Be authorized by the governing body of each party to the contract unless a party to the contract is a municipally owned electric utility, in which event the governing body may establish procedures for entering into interlocal contracts that do not exceed $100,000 without requiring the approval of the governing body ; b. State the purpose, terms, rights , and duties of the contracting parties; and c. Specify that each party paying for the performance of governmental functions or services must make those payments from current revenues available to the paying party . In addition, an interlocal contractual payment must be in an amount that fairly compensates the performing party for the services or functions performed under the contract.94 10.1.3 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) and Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) A written document that represents the agreement of the parties regarding the subject matter of the document; it does not usually involve the transfer of funds in exchange for services but may document the transfer of funds required by statute. MOUs and MOAs are sometimes directed by statute. 10.1.4 Processing a Non-Competitive Contract or Agreement a. Once the program identifies a need using one of the non-competitive methods listed above , the contract manager will download the applicable contract template and uniform term s and conditions from the CAPPS Financials Contract Template Library . 94 Tex. Gov't Code 791.011(d), (e) . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 94 b. The contract manager will contact System Contracting for an attorney assignment. c. The assigned attorney and contract manager will work on the applicable contract/ agreement. d. The contract manager will create a procurement number in CAPPS Financials and create the contract record. i. If the contract has funds associated, the contract manager will enter a CAPPS Financials requisition with the total contract value in the request document and the funds associated with the fiscal year on the requisition line. ii. If the contract does not have funds associated, no requisition is required. a. The contract manager will create the contract packet that includes the signature page, any attachments (if applicable ), the required term s and conditions and any supplemental or special conditions (if applicable ), PCS Form 515, and the requisition and request document, if funds are associated. b. The contract manager will enter the contract elements into the contract record and create a document. i. If the agreement has funds associated, the contract packet must be routed for CAPPS approvals. The contract manager will load the applicable approvers into the approval path in CAPPS and submit. ii. If the agreement does not have funds associated, the document will auto approve. c. Once the documents are approved or auto approved, the contract manager will send the contract packet to HHSC PCS Procurement QA to route in DocuSign for execution. d. Once executed, the contract manager will finalize the contract record in CAPPS, complete any necessary contract elements, put the contract in approved status , and save. (This process will automatically send the record to SCOR ). e. The contract manager will load the executed contract and any contract documents in SCOR. 10.2 Open Enrollment Contracts An open enrollment is a non-competitive method used for the acquisition of services when the eligibility of potential providers includes a common set of qualifying criteria and fixed terms and conditions (including fixed compensation rates) . Open enrollments are not procurement s, so there are no restrictions on discussions with applicants prior or during the posting perio d. However , there must be consistency in responses provided . All eligible applicants \u2014 anyone who meets all the eligibility requirements and accepts all terms and conditions (including pricing/rates) \u2014 that can provide the required services in the requested locations will receive a contract . 10.2.1 How to Determine the Use of Open Enrollment Contracts In determining whether to use open enrollment as a contr acting method, the following conditions must exist: a. Services are readily available and may be needed throughout the state or in a specified HHS region; b. Services are those for which providers can be required to meet defined, accepted standards (including state licensure , accreditation, and/or certification) or specific eligibility criteria; and c. A standard payment rate will be established for all providers for the same services. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 95 10.2.2 Developing the Enrollment Document/Scope of Work The contract manager is responsible for taking the lead in developing the open enrollment document/scope of work and ensuring that the following criteria are included in the open enrollment document: a. HHS agency /program are the sole point of contact for the open enrollment while it is posted , as well as receive and screen all applications for completeness and ability to contract . b. Provider/Entity Eligibility Requirements are criteria the applicant must meet to qualify to receive a contract. This will include vendor screening checks as well as applicable experience, license, accreditation, certification and other key requirements to provide the service requested . c. The fixed rates stated in the enrollment for the services provided can be statewide or by region. The rate can be linked to a program site or linked to Medicaid/Medicare rates . d. A service locati on is where the applicant provides services throughout the state or a specific region. If an open enrollment seeks service providers at multiple locations , and applicants are permitted to select what locations they wish to service, and if an applicant applies to a specific location , that is the only location at which the applicant can provide services . e. An allocation method for multiple contractors in one area. The enrollment must state how service determination will be made if an area has multiple providers. 10.2.3 Processing an Open Enrollment a. The contract manager or HHS agency program contact will work with the System Contract ing attorney when drafting the open enrollment document s, using the Open Enrollment template approved by System Contracting as well as System Contracting approved contract templates . Once the open enrollment document s are approved by the assigned attorney and program, the contract manger will create an open enrollment procurement number in CAPPS Financials. b. The contract manager will post the open enrollment to the HHS website , Open Enrollment Opportunities page, and may post the enrollment on their program website linking to the HHS Open Enrollment Opportunities website page , if necessary. Amendments to the posted open enrollment, as determined by the contract manager or HHS agency program staff, must be submitted to System Contracting for attorney assignment. Typically, amendments will require posting a new open enrollment. Depending on the circumstances, some amendments may be made to posted open enrollments . However, if there is an amendment, it must be incorporated into all existing contracts that were issued under the open enrollment that is being amended. The contract manager or HHS agency program staff must ensure that the same qualification, requirements, rates, terms and conditions apply to all contractors. Individual consideration must be given to each amendment to determine the course of action to be taken (e.g., amending or reposting) and System Contracting must be consulted . To post or modify an approved posting on the HHS Open Enrollment Opportunities website page , program personnel should complete the Web Services Request form. The contract manager will enter the required information including the program director who approved the posting. Web Services will need 2-3 business days to complete the posting request. Enrollments for DFPS will be posted to the ESBD as well as the HHS Open Enrollment Opportunities website page by a purchaser. Requests for this action should be submitted to O365 -pcs-servicesteammanagement@txhhs.onmicrosoft.com . c. Once the enrollment is posted and applications are received by the contract manager or HHS agency program , submitted documentation will be reviewed for completeness by the contract manager or HHS agenc y program . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 96 d. Applications will be screened , and a determination of the applicant's capacity to perform will be made by the contract manager or HHS agency program . The screening of the document should include: i. Forms, attachments or documentation of eligibility requested; and ii. Procurement checks as listed in the enrollment document. e. If the application is missing required documentation requested in the enrollment, the HHS agency program may contact the applicant to complete the application . f. Once the enrollment contact has screened the application and determined the applicant is eligible, the contract will be drafted. g. To receive a contract number and for the contract to be entered in CAPPS, the program contract manager will: i. Locate the procurement number entered in CAPPS Financials and click the create contract button ; ii. Populate the contract data in the contract entry page and create a document ; and iii. The document will automatically approve. h. The contract manager submit s the contract packet which includes the signature page, any attachments, if applicable, the term and conditions and any special conditions, if applicable, PCS Form 515 to HHSC Procurement QA for routing in DocuSign; or the contract can be submitted electronically to the applicant in accordance with the signature authority thresholds set out in C-046. i. Once executed, the contract manager finalize s the contract record in CAPPS, complete s any necessary contract elements, puts the contract in approved status and save s. (This will automatically send the record to SCOR ). j. The contract manager load s the executed contract and any contract documents into SCOR . 11. GRANTS In contrast to the procurement methods, a Request for Applications (RFA ) is not a sanctioned method for procuring goods and services from a vendor. An agency issues an RFA when it, as the grantor, is responsible for awarding grant funds to other entities , such as other state agencies, local governments, nonprofit organizations , or private entities.95 There may be instances where state or federal grant funding can be used to fund multiple programs that provide different services for varying target populations or service areas. Although several programs can be supported via available grant funding, RFA documents are intended to solicit applications for singular programs. An RFA can encompass multiple eligible activities or costs under the same program that allow for variances in the applicant's project approach or methodology. Although multiple program RFAs may have the same funding source or authority, encouraging applicants to submit one application for each program under separate RFAs provides evaluators and final decision -makers alike the opportunity to review the merits and cost-effectiveness of that project alone against the program requirements. This eliminates potential confusion in determining an applicant's proposed cost and approach to multiple programs that could be contained within the same RFA. NOTE: PCS will make the final determination as to whet her applications for multiple programs may be solicited under a single RFA. Until such a determination has been requested and provided by the PCS Grants Director in writing, when developing documents prior to PCS involvement HHS program staff should operate under the assumption that RFAs will be utilized to solicit applications for singular programs. 95 Comptroller's Guide, Request for Applications. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 97 Grant solicitation s and announcements are posted on the PCS Grants Request for Applications (RFA) web page , which may be accessed at https://apps.hhs.texas.gov/pcs/rfa.cfm and on the State of Texas Department of Information Resources' Texas.gov eGrants web site which may be accessed at https://txapps.texas.gov/tolapp/egrants/search.htm . 11.1 Request for Applications (RFA) PCS Operating Procedure 572 RFAs are a type of solicitation method by which an HHS agency awards grant funds to other entities such as other state agencies, local governments, nonprofit organizations or private entities. An RFA announces that grant funding is available and allows organizations to present applications. 11.1.1 Outline An RFA must include the grant objective, guidelines, any limitations on spending or eligibility, performance measures, remedies for failure to meet performance measures and reporting requirements, the evaluation criteria, and other information needed to submit an application. The RFA will typically outline: a. What type of applicants are eligible; b. Requirements in accordance with the grant or notice of award; c. What the expectation s are; and d. How applications are submitted and reviewed. PCS Form 562 , RFA Development Tool, is intended for use as an optional planning tool to provide program areas with the prerequisite information needed to complete a draft RFA . Article numbers, section numbers and titles correspond with the RFA template. PCS Form 562 onl y includes information program areas need to provide to PCS to begin RFA development. The RFA template also contains narrative prompts and may be developed without the use of PCS Form 562. 11.1.2 Remedies Remedies may include: a. Costs disallowance ; b. Increased monito ring; c. Corrective action plans ; d. Placing special conditions on awards or precluding the recipient from obtaining future awards for a specified period ; or e. Gran t termination . 11.1.3 Uniform Grant Guidance (UGG) and Texas Grant Management Standards (TxGMS) When issuing an RFA, Title 2, Part 200 of the Code of Federal Regulations (2 CFR Part 200) , the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards , also known as the UGG and the Texas Com ptroller of Public Accounts ' Texas Grant Management Standards (TxGMS) must be considered to the extent applicable. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 98 11.2 Determination of Subrecipient, Recipient, or Contractor Relationship Process PCS Poli cy 438 The determination of a subrecipient, recipient, or contractor relationship is made during the planning phase for an RFA, RFP, or RFQ . 11.2.1 Stakeholders The determination process involves various stakeholders that may include: a. Customer organization contract staff ; b. Customer organization program staff ; c. OCC Legal Policy ; and d. PCS, with the final determination made by the PCS Grants Division. 11.2.2 Compliance HHS agencies must comply with UGG and TxGMS (or its successor) , as applicable, when determining the correct solicitation method and implementation. PCS Form 438 must be completed to help stakeholders in their assessment of the standards, principles, and requirements that will govern the relationship. PCS Form 438 serves as a tool to assist in the final determination of the relationship. For DFPS procurements, the DFPS 438 form will be used in place of PCS Form 438. The approved PCS Form 438 is uploaded into the SCOR Contract module, Documents sub-module. Requests for 438 determinations should be sent to PCS_Grants@hhsc.state.tx.us .

If the funding is state, type the citation of funding such as Appropriations Act Rider or authorizing statute in the Comments field . d. PCS Grants staff will coordinate with the requester to obtain additional clarifications or requests for more information to make a final determination if needed. PCS Grants has 10 business days to make a determination once receiving a complete determination packet. e. Afte r the PCS Grants team designates the final determination and returns the completed PCS Form 438 to the program area , the program contract manager upload s it into the SCOR Contract module, Documents sub-module, within 10 business days from the contract begin date. f. If the program requests a re-determination, they may resubmit PCS Form 438 with additional supporting documentation for reconsideration within five business days from the date of the decision. PCS will process the request for a re-evaluation within three business days and consult with PCS and OCC Legal Policy , as necessary. The final determination shall remain consistent throughout the procurement and contract lifecycle. 11.3 Non -Competitive Direct Grant Award PCS Operating Procedure 437 It is HHSC pol icy to maximize competition for grants to the greatest extent practicable. As such, HHS PCS promotes the use of the RFA process to solicit the widest eligible applicant pool possible to compete openly and fairly for available grant funding. PCS Form 437 , Non -Competitive Direct Grant Award Justification , must be completed by program, when requesting to award discretionary grant funding to an eligible grantee(s) or subrecipient(s) without using a competitive process. Program mu st demonstrate that at least one of the following criteria is met: a. State agencies and units of local governments ; b. Legislative/ regulatory directive ; c. Emergency award ; and/ or d. Sole provider . As soon as practicable after determining a non-competitive direct grant award may be appropriate, HHSC program staff shall complete the PCS Form 437 and route to their respective Chief for signature; for DSHS and DFPS, the form must be signed by individual s identified as designees authorized to approve special purchases found in the HHS Special Purchases Autho rized Designees document. Once signed by program, the completed Form PCS Form 437 will be reviewed by the PCS Associate Commissioner to determine whether a non- competitive direct grant award is authorized. 12. SOLICITATION REVIEW 12.1 System Contracting System Contracting attorneys are involved primarily, but not exclusively, in solicitations assigned to PCS's complex purchasing team. When an attorney is assigned to a solicitation, the attorney is involved throughout the solicitation and contract developm ent processes. (Reference Section 5.2.2 regarding System Contracting ). To request a System Contracting attorney assignment , all required information must be provided, including drafts of documents for which review is requested. System Contracting attorney assignment requests should be submitted through the OCC System Contracting Intake Portal . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 102 12.2 Compliance and Quality Control Review (CQC) All solicitations and addendums for RFPs, RFAs, RFOs, and RFQs must be submitted to HHS CQC for review and approval prior to submission to the CAT, if CAT review is applicable, and prior to posting. Evaluation tools, scored criteria and subcriteria , and score sheets will be reviewed for accuracy, relevance, reasonableness , as well as other factors that ensure an effective solicitation. IFBs may be subject to review by HHS CQC prior to posting if specifically requested by the Deputy Executive Commissioner of PCS, Associate Commissioner of PCS, Deputy Executive Commissioner of CQC, or Associate Commissioner of CQC. Bids are subject to spot checks prior to award at the discretion of the Deputy Executive Commissioner of PCS, Associate Commissioner of PCS, Deputy Associate Commissioner of CQC, or Associate Commissioner of CQC. 12.3 Contract Advisory Team (CAT) Review CAT assists state agencies in improving contract management practices by reviewing and making recommendations on solicitation and contract documents that have an expected value of at least $5 million dollars during the full term of the contract, including renewal periods. RFPs, RFAs, RFOs, and RFQs must be reviewed and approved by CQC prior to submission to CAT. (Reference Section 12.5 regarding CQC Review of Solicitations and Evaluations ). By statute, state agencies must comply with CAT recommendations or submit to CAT a writt en explanation why the recommendation is not applicable . See Section 2262.101 of the Texas Government Code; Comptroller's Guide, CAT - Review of Solicitations With a Value of $5 Million or More ; and applicable CPA administrative rules. Generally, grant agreements are not subject to a CAT review whe n the recipients eligible for award are governmental entities or nonprofit business entities . However, upon request, CAT will review grant agreements where the recipients eligible for award are for-profit business entities. Sole federally funded grants do not require review by CAT. a. PCS is the point of contact for the CAT review process and will work with the HHS agency to consult with CAT. b. PCS will work with the HHS agency to comply with CAT recommendations or provide CAT a written explanation as to why a recommendation is not applicable to the procurement under review. CQC and System Contracting review agency responses to CAT recommendations. Written explanations as to why a recommendation is not applicable to the procurement under review must be reviewed and approved by CQC prior to submission back to CAT. c. If substantial changes are made to the initial solicitation documents submitted for CAT review, PCS must resubmit the solicitation documents for CAT review . d. PCS will post the solicitation after receipt of CAT approval notification and all other necessary internal and external approvals . e. PCS will maintain the HHS agency's response s to the CAT recommendation s within the procurement file. 12.4 Quality Assurance Team (QAT) Review \u2014 Major Information Resources Projects (MIRP) The Quality Assurance Team is an interagency working group comprised of members from the LBB, DIR, and CPA, with SAO participating as an advisory member. The QAT is legislatively tasked with the review, approval, and oversight of MIRPs. All state agencies are subject to QAT oversight, except for institutions of higher education and self-directed, semi -independent state agencies. Submission of required documents and notices to QAT are handled by the Federal and State Reporting Coordination department within the HHS Information Technology Business Operations Division . Program staff, contract managers, and purchasers should work closely with the Federal State Coordination team to ensure all requirements are met and appropriately documented in the contract and procurement file. The Federal and State Reporting Coordination department may be contacted by email: IT_FederalStateCoordination@hhsc.state.tx.us . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 103 12.4.1 General Requirements Procurements for MIRPs must be reviewed and approved by QAT at various stages of the procurement and contracting cycle. Som e of the steps required to be followed for a MIRP include: a. Texas Project Delivery Framework documents are required to be filed with QAT for each MIRP before the project can be initiated.96 b. A project plan must be developed and filed with QAT before HHS spends more than ten percent (10%) of allocated funds for the project.97 c. An acquisition plan is required to be filed with QAT for MIRPs that involve a procurement with a value of at least $10 million.98 d. Before issuing a solicitation for a MIRP with a contract value of at least $10 million, HHS must develop a procurement plan, consistent with any acquisition plan provided in the Comptroller's Guide with anticipated service levels and performance standards for each contractor and a method to monitor changes to the scope of each contract.99 e. HHS is required to notify QAT when it advertises a procurement for a MIRP. The notification is required to include the requisition number of the solicitation.100 f. Prior to negotiating a MIRP contract with a value of at least $10 million, HHS must submit the draft contract containing proposed terms to QAT.101 g. After the final negotiated terms of a MIRP contract with a value of at least $10 million are developed, HHS must submit the final negotiated, unsigned contract to QAT. QAT will review and provide recommendations. HHS is required to comply with the recommendations or submit a written explanation to QAT why the recommendation is not applicable to the contract at issue.102 h. Within 10 business days of contract award of a MIRP with a value of at least $10 million, HHS must provide notice of the completed contract to QAT.103 12.4.2 Amending or Canceling MIRP Contract s Additional notifications are required before amending a contract for MIRPs including notifications to the governor, lieutenant governor, speaker of the house of representatives, presiding officer of the standing committee of each house of the legislature with primary jurisdiction over appropriations, and the QAT if: (i) the total value of the amended contract exceeds or will exceed the initial contract value by 10% or more; or (ii) the amendment requires the contractor to provide consultative services, technical expertise, or other assistance in defining project scope or deliverables. In addition, if such amendments are being made, HHS must provide a justification for the amendment to the QAT as well as a copy of the final version of the amendment, including all appendices and attachments .104 96 Tex.

The QAT must approve the cost-benefit analysis for the project to continue.106 The QAT may waive certain review requirements.107 Any waiver received from the QAT should be saved in the contract file. 12.4.3 Definition of a MIRP108 A MIRP is defined as: a. Any information resources technology project identified in a state agency's biennial operating plan whose development costs exceed $5 million and that: i. Requires one year or longer to reach operations status; ii. Involves more than one state agency; or iii. Substantially alters work methods of state agency personnel or the delivery of services to clients; and b. Any information resources technology project designated by the legislature in the GAA as a MIRP.109 12.5 CQC Review of Solicitations and Evaluations PCS Operating Procedure 753 It is the policy of PCS that all RFPs, RFAs, RFOs, and RFQs be submitted to CQC for review and approval prior to submission to the Contract Advisory Team (CAT) and prior to posting the solicitation or addenda related to the solicitation; that all solicitations with scored evaluations be submitted to CQC Financial Analysts for review and validation of the proposed scored criteria, evaluator score sheets, and final evaluation tool; and that the compilation and final scoring for solicitations with scored evaluations be completed by CQC Financial Analysts. 12.6 Solicitation Advertisement PCS Operating Procedure 537 Solicitations for procurements with a contract that have a maximum potential contract value of more than $25,000 (includ ing renewal periods) are posted to the ESBD for 14 calendar days or more , in accordance with Texas Government Code, Section 2155.083 . A contract or procurement award made by a state agency that violates the applicable minimum time for posting required by Section 2155.083, Subsections (h) and (i) is void. Major consulting services contracts must also be posted to the ESBD. RFAs are announced on Texas.gov's eGrants webpage and posted to HHS's Grants RFA webpage, generally for no less than 30 calendar days and no more than 60 calendar days. TxGMS discourages the use of ESBD for announcing grant opportunities .Program may also submit PCS Form 127, Potential Applicant Notification List, to PCS identifying potential applicants to be notified of the RFA posting. Potential applicants may include 105 GAA , S.B. 1, 87th Leg., R.S., art. IX, 106 GAA , S.B. 1, Leg., R.S., 107 GAA , S.B. 1, 87th Leg., R.S., art.

Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 105 current grantees, previous applicants, or other interested parties including associations and related programmatic mailing lists. 12.7 Vendor Conference PCS Operating Procedure 574 A vendor conference is a structured, face -to-face meeting with potential respondents to clarify what is being purchased, to further explain PCS's procur ement process, and to answer ques tions related to the requirements in the solicitation packet. The purpose of the conference is to provide respondents with additional information or clarifications that may be helpful in formulating their responses. A vendor conference is strongly recommended if the solicitation requires a HUB Subcontracting Plan, is high dollar, or complex. Otherwise , a vendor conference is optional and the decision to hold one is at the discretion of the program/division and PCS Purchaser/contract administrator. The timeframe to obtain the service should be a consideration when deciding whether to include a vendor conferen ce in the procurement process. A vendor conference should be scheduled in the middle of the open solicitation period , to allow respondents time to review the questions and answers posted on the ESBD and develop their proposal accordingly. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 106 Vendor Selection Procurement and Contract Management Handbook v. 1.0 107 13. VENDOR SELECTION 13.1 Bid Room PCS Operating Procedure 210 PCS coordinates the handling of informal and formal solicitations. Upon receipt by PCS, sealed response s must be marked with a date and time stamp directly on the package. Response s remain sealed and kept in a secure place until the solicitation opening date. Responses received by email are treated as sealed response documents and kept secure until the response due date and time. Electronic submissions are submitted to the PCS Bid mailbox or the online bid room system. A copy of the email received with the response documents attached must reflect the date and time of receipt. All responses received are tracked by logging receipt information into the Response Log. 13.1.1 Bid Room Roles and Responsibilities a. Bid Room Coordinator receives notification of posted event from purchaser , ensures responses are received on or before the due date and time designed in the solicitation , time stamps the packages , and indicates how many packages were received from the vendor. Electronic submissions are submitted to the PCS Bid mailbox or via the online bid room system. The network email server time stamp is the official timepiece that determines receipt of responses. Response information is entered in the Response Log. The coordinator keeps responses secured until the solicitation due date and time. At the due date and time, the coordinator provides original responses and a copy of the Response Log to the purchaser. b. PCS Purchase r, upon posti ng of solicitation, notifies Bid Room Coordinator of the bid opening. Notification includes an event number, due date and time of event , as well as the specified format for responses. Purchasers may not have bids submitted to their own email address. The purchaser receives responses provide d by the bid room coordinator , keeps a copy of the Response Log in the procurement file, and notifies the bid room coordinator of any canceled solicitations. c. Vendor submits responses via hand delivery, the PCS bid room mail box, or the Online Bid Room System. 13.1.2 Online Bid Room System The HHS Online Bid Room is a bid room database for vendors to submit responses to formal and informal solicitations. The HHS Online Bid Room can be used for formal IFB, RFA, RFO, - online -bid-room for more information . 13.2 Screening Responses \u2014 Bids , Proposals , and Applications 13.2.1 Adminis trative Review Each response is examined to determine whether it is responsive to the solicitation. Only responses responsive to the solicitation may be evaluated. 13.2.2 HSP Evaluation When an HSP is required, all respondents (HUBs and Non -HUBs) must include a completed HSP with their solicitation response. An HSP is required regardless if the respondent intends to self-perform or subcontract for services, equipment, materials and/or supplies to fulfill the contract. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 108 The PCS purchaser will provide the HUB coordinator with the HSP, and a copy of the proposal, for review and approval, prior to forwarding a response for further evaluation. Responses with non- responsive HSPs will be disqualified. The respondent shall utilize one of the following good faith effort (GFE) methods in preparing the initial HSP for submission with the proposal, or to amend an existing HSP post contract award. The GFE methods are as follows: a. Solicitation Method: The respondent must notify at least three currently Texas -certified HUB s per subcontracting opportunity providing the certified HUB at least seven working days to respond . The date the notification is sent is day zero and does not count in the required seven working days (excluding the day the notice was sent, weekends, federal and state holidays and any other day the executive director has closed the agency (i.e., cold weather days)) . The notice must provide the scope of work for HUB to determine if they are interested in pursuing , provide a location where the specifications are located (i.e., link to the posting on ESBD or a physical location, etc.), and information regarding insurance and bonding requirements (if applicable) . In addition, the respondent must notify a minimum of two minority, women, trade organizations and/or business development centers providing the same information above as well as the same time frame for response. b. Mentor -Prot\u00e9g\u00e9: A mentor may utilize a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 from a state agency sponsored Mentor -Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (M-P) agreement for subcontracting the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 is able to provide. The M-P relationship may be utilized in lieu of additional soliciting to HUBs. c. Utilizing 100% HUBs for all subcontracting: The respondent indicates that all subcontracting will be done utilizing HUB vendors. d. Meeting or exceeding the contract's HUB goal: The respondent will meet or exceed the contract HUB goal (whichever is the highest, statewide or agency -specific) with HUB subcontractors . The respondent canno t utilize a HUB subcontractor used in a previous continuous contract for a period of five years or more. e. Self-Performing: The respondent is required to document how they are able to provide all services, equipment, materials and/or supplies needed to perform the contract without subcontracting. The agency must review the proposal to ensure that this is a true statement and pay careful attention to the list of key personnel, to ensure that all personnel listed are employees . Statements within the proposal that include \"partners ,\" \"affiliates ,\" \"team member ,\" and/or \"consultants\" indicate subcontracting activities. When in doubt, ask the respondent for a clarification. Sometimes, respondents don't think of these examples as subcontractors, but they are according to the state definition. Regardless of the above GFE method chosen, respondents are required to provide supporting documentation to substantiate compliance. The supporting documentation must be included in the procure ment file. If the solicitation response does not contain a completed HSP or contains a HSP that the agency determines was not developed in good faith, the response shall be rejected as a material failure to comply with advertised specifications. The HSP evaluation is performed by the agency's HUB program (PCS Form 415) and is on a pass or fail bases. Responses that do not contain a responsive HSP cannot be considered for a contract award. 13.2.3 Respondent Evaluation To select the respondent that provides best value to the state, HHS agency staff conduct an evaluation of the response in accordance with the evaluation procedure published in the solicitation. Evaluations of applications received under RFAs must also be performed to select an applicant that best meets the needs of the grant program objectives. Complex procurements may have a standard evaluation process that utilizes an evaluation tool or may be conducted through a cons ensus scoring Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 109 method (Reference Section 7.12.3 regarding Conse nsus Scoring Method ). The standard evaluation process may be conducted in CAPPS Financials or outside CAPPS Financials. Most RFA evaluations are conducted outside CAPPS Financial s due to complexity factors that impact the use of the evaluation tool. At a minimum, an RFx evaluation team should consist of three to five scoring members who represent different subject matter areas related to the final product or service. The program should ensure appropriate subject matter representation on the team, including program, contract management, finance, IT, and others as needed. The PCS Purchaser or grant specialist serves as the evaluation team facilitator and is a non-scoring member. Scoring and non-scoring members of the evaluation team must be noted in the procurement file. If the evaluation is to be conducted within CAPPS Financials, the evaluation team will be required to have employee IDs to log into the system and to request access to CAPPS Financial s as an evaluation team member. The PCS Purchaser or grant specialis t will ensure all evaluation team members complete any required ethics, confidentiality, and non-disclosure forms prior to reviewing or discussing any proposals. For contract procurements with an expected value of $1 million or more, the SAO Nepotism Disclosure Statement for Purchasing Personnel is required. The evaluation team cannot commence any discussions until each member has signed a non-disclosure statement and a preliminary assessment regarding actual or potential conflicts of interest have been conducted. Each member of the evaluation team is provided: a. The entire solicitation to include any addenda and Q&A documents; b. A list of responses submitted ; and c. A copy of each response determined to be responsive to the solicitation following the Administrative Review . Each response is evaluated independently against the evaluation criteria published in the solicitation. Evaluators will record their scores for each response on the evaluation tool's scoring matrix provided to them by the Purchaser or grant specialist if the evaluation is being conducted outside of CAPPS Financials , or by logging into CAPPS Financial s and recording the scores in the CAPPS Financials evaluation tool. Unless prohibited by statute or agency policy, evaluators should review and score the entire response to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of the response. In limited circumstances at PCS and CQC discretion, program areas may have dedicated evaluators for certain criteria to best align evaluator knowledge and skillset to the review process. In these scenarios, program areas must identify the specific criteria evaluators are assigned with a clear breakdown of what each group will be assigned to score specific to their area of expertise. The use of technical advisors may be permissible during the evaluation phase if approved and as directed by PCS and CQC. The evaluation team only review s the price component if the team is evaluating the price. The price component may be evaluated by SME s, evaluation team, or if solely objective the CQC -FA. Evaluators must not communicate with a respondent. All questions related to the response or the evaluation process must be directed to the PCS purchaser or grant specialist facilitating the evaluation . The PCS Purchaser or grant speci alist may follow up with the respondent to obtain clarification or seek assistance from a technical advisor. 13.2.3.1 Oral Presentations After the response evaluation phase , if permitted by the solicitation, the HHS agency may provide respondents the opportunity to provide an oral presentation. Oral presentations and demonstrations must be fair to all respondents. To ensure the integrity of the oral presentation process, evaluator information and informational document for the respondents must be kept separate and secure. HHSC PCS utilizes a Red and Blue folder Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 110 system for oral presentations. Both folders are clearly labeled : one folder for evaluator materials and one folder for respondent materials. 13.2.3.2 Best and Final Offer (BAFO) After oral presentations or demonstrations are completed, HHS agencies may work with PCS to request a BAFO from the respondents. BAFO s may be requested prior to negotiation and may be used to narrow the field of competition. BAFOs are only used in the evaluation of RFx procurements . 13.2.3.3 Preferences Preferences are established by statute.110 A vendor must claim the applicable preference(s) in its response by marking the appropriate preference on the preference form included in the solicitation. If the appropriate box is not marked on the preference form, a preference will not be granted unless other documents included in the response sufficiently demonstrate that the vendor may receive the preference and is requesting the preference. Upon the agency's request, the vendor must provide adequate documentation to support a claimed preference below .111 a.

Foods of higher nutritional value s. Commercial production company or advertising agency located in Texas 13.2.3.4 Tie Bids PCS Operating Procedure 755 A tie bid occurs when two or more bids or responses to a competitive solicitation receive the same score. If after final evaluatio n scores are calculated the winning bidder or respondent cannot be determined because two or more bids or responses received the same score, the tie will be resolved in accordance with PCS Operating Procedure 755. 13.2.3.5 Certification of Vendor Assessment Process PCS Form 08 is used to document certification of the vendor assessment process. PCS Form 08 -G is used for RFAs. Pursuant to Section 2261.0525 of the Texas Government Code Section , before a state agency may award a contract to a vendor, the agency's procurement director must review the process and all documents used by the agency to assess each vendor who responded to the solicitation. The procurement director or designee (a person whose position in the agency's procurement office is at least equal to the position of contract manager) must certify in writing that each response to the solicitation was assessed using the written criteria in the solicitation or, if applicable, the written evaluation criteria established by the agency , and that the final calculation of scoring responses was accurate. Any scoring changes following initial assessment and scoring of responses must be justified in writing. The written justification must be reviewed by the agency's procurement director and the procurement director must certify in writing that the change in scoring was appropriate. Pursuant to Section 2261.054 of the Texas Government Code Section , if a state agency awards a contract to a vendor who did not receive the highest score in an assessment process certified under Section 2261.0525 of the Texas Government Code , the agency must state in writing in the contract file the reasons for making the award . PCS Form 08 is used to document the required justification and certification . PCS Form 08 -G is used to document the required justification and certification for RFAs. See also, Section 14.14.6 regardin g Other Certifications. The completed PCS Form 08, or PCS Form 08 -G, must be included with supporting documentation attached to PCS Form 515 used for contract review, approval, and execution. The approved PCS Form 08, or PCS Form 08 -G, must be maintained in the procurement file, and is uploaded into the SCOR, Procurement module. 13.2.3.6 Documentation Once the procurement is complete and the first contract awarded and executed through CAPPS, the event will be available in SCOR for PCS to upload the procurement file documentation. PCS will upload the solicitation package as one file within 10 days and the rest of the procurement file within 30 days. 13.3 Litigation History Review If required, the purchaser will submit a request to the attorney assigned to the solicitation. If respondents are required to provide litigation histories, the assigned System Contracting attorney will coordinate with : Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 112 a. Policy to check if there are any statutory or regulatory prohibitions by program against the agency's contracting with potential vendors that have been subjec t to administrative enforcement and/or disciplinary action ; and b. Litigation to check if the respondent has any active lawsuit s pending against the state. The information may be considered as an indicator of probable vendor performance under the contract such as past vendor performance, the vendor's financial resources and ability to perform, the vendor's experience and responsibility, and the vendor's ability to provide reliable maintenance agreements. 13.4 Financial Capacity Review Contract Finance Support may provide financial risk assessment of proposed procurements and assistance identifying the need for a review of financial capacity of any respondents; subject matter expert(s) to evaluate financial capacity submitted with responses; assistance developing cost workbooks and financial provisions and requirements; subject matter expert(s) to review price component for high -risk, high -value, or other applicable procurements; and assistance negotiating pricing and developing financial payment structure . 13.5 Reference Checks If applicable, purchasers may check vendor references by completing PCS Form 145, Vendor Reference Survey Form . 13.6 Notice of Disqualification and Intent to Award (aka Tentative Award Procedure) PCS Operating Procedure 538 In order to provide respondents with timely notice and information, and to ensure transparency and public confidence in HHSC procurement processes, it is the policy of PCS that a respondent should be notified as soon as reasonably practicable following the determination that the respondent's solicitation response is nonresponsive or has been disqualified from further review, including disqualification for failure to submit a compliant HUB Subcontracting Plan. In addition, unless it is determined to be contrary to the best interests of the agency, it is the intention of PCS to provide notice to all respondents of the intent to award at the time the agency has successfully negotiated a contract. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook v. 1.0 113 Contract Formation and Award Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 114 14. CONTRACT FORMATION AND AWARD 14.1 Contract Negotiations Negotiations may not begin until program staff have informed the purchaser of their selection to proceed to negotiations. Program staff must do this by initiating and sending the partially completed PCS Form 08 (Vendor Selection Justification and Procurement Certification ) or PCS Form 08 -G for RFAs (Applicant Selection Justification and Solicitation Certification Form), signed by the program, to the purchaser. For RFA, Section 1 of PCS Form 08-G is completed and is signed by the program under Progr am Approval to Proceed. As the PCS Form 08, or PCS Form 08 -G must also include the outcome of the negotiations, the final PCS Form 08, or PCS Form 08 -G, cannot be delivered to the purchaser until after negotiations. Once the purchaser informs the program in writing that they may begin negotiations, the program staff may begin scheduling the negotiation meetings. PCS is not required to be involved in negotiations. However, program staff must have their assigned attorney present during negotiations and included on all related correspondence. If program areas need guidance on conducting negotiations, or need assistance scheduling the negotiations, PCS will be available to assist. The outcome of contract negotiation will depend on the proc urement method and the items being negotiated but will always be guided by obtaining the best value for the state. Negotiation is permitted for RFPs (includes consulting), RFOs , RFAs and RFQs for professional services . However , negotiation s must not materially alter the requirements , scope of services, or specifications of the published solicitation. Negotiation s are not permitted under an IFB. However, if there is only one qualified bidder, then the contract developer may negotiate with the sole bidder, including price, provided the negotiation does not result in a material change to the advertised specifications. Negotiations may include obtaining clarifications and discuss ing any ambiguities or deficiencies in the business proposal, the cost proposal, service delivery strategies, and any other items. Appropriate HHS agency staff involved in negotiations may include program staff ; System Contracting ; contract manager s; and purchaser , if requested. There are a few ground rules for negotiating state contracts: a. All changes or revisions to the offer must be documented in writing. Negotiations must not materially alter requirements of the published solicitation. Care must be taken by the agency to avoid inadvertently changing the advertised procurement objectives. b. Any information related to a negotiation must be provided to all potential contractors who are being considered; however, clarifications may be unique. No contractor being considered for award should receive information that would give them a competitive edge over others. Information about an offer is not shared with any other potential contractors. c. HHS agencies must comply with the Texas Public Information Act ( Chapter 552 of the Texas Government Code). HHS a gencies do not have authority to agree that public information will not be subject to disclosure. Rather, disclosure is governed by the Texas Public Information Act and by rulings of the Office of the Texas Attorney General. Also, HHS agencies must follow public posting requirements for state contracts under Section 2261.253 of the Texas Government Code. Questions about the Texas Public Information Act or Section 2261.253 of the Texas Government Code should be referred to the Office of Chief Counsel. If a contractor claims a contract contains confidential or proprietary information, the individual receiving the claim should contact OCC Open Records (OpenRecordsRequest@hhsc.state.tx.us) and PCS SCOR ( PSC_SCOR@hhsc.state.tx.us ) and notify the Contract Manager. d. Before HHS awards a contract for goods or services, the Director of Procurement, or designee, must certify that the procurement file and procurement checklist are consistent with the model procurement file checklist created by the CPA. The certified checklist must be uploaded into SCOR procurement module with the procurement file. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 115 Program staff should begin the negotiation process by develop ing a prioritized list of issues, including the agency's requirements on risk mitigation items such as insurance, limitation of liability, indemnification, liquidated damages, data use agreements (including protections for breach of confidential data), escalation vehicles, corrective action plans, etc. It is crucial that program staff enter negotiations knowing what is most important and having a list of items to draw from during the give-and-take process of negotiations. If using liquidated damages, prior to negotiations program staff should also develop a liquidated damages schedule that protects what is most important, keeps the contractor on track, and reflects as justifiably as possible the value of deliverables for which a value is difficult or impossible to assess. In addition, almost every contract negotiation will cover the following negotiation topics: order of precedence, limitations of liability, indemnification, and data security and ownership. 14.2 Purchase Order s and Contract s When the solicitation is closed, evaluations are finalized, and contract negotiations are complete, if applicable, the terms and conditions of the agreement are documented to prevent misunderstanding or conflict and to create a legal, binding, and enforceable obligation. Purchase orders and contracts are documents processed by HHS agencies to purchase goods or services. The main difference between the two documents is their duration. While purchase orders represent single, short - term transactions, contracts are used to register the long -term agreement between the involved parties and may also include renewal options. Although terms and conditions are typically listed in both purchase orders and contracts, terms and conditions are more specific in contracts and are used when there are more complex terms associated with the purchase. For HHS procurement operations, additional guidance is provided below to help distinguish the characteristics associated with the following HHS contract documents. 14.2.1 Trans actional Purchase Order (TPO) A TPO is a type of purchase order . It is a legally enforceable agreement to purchase a good or service, established for a single procurement term not to exceed 12 months or one fiscal year. A TPO has no stated renewals and may cross fiscal years if a capital service or good or if the total expenditure is completed during the fiscal year but services last longer than one fiscal year (i.e., software maintenance) . Typically, a TPO is a point -in-time purchase (not attached to an existing contract) which begins and ends with the delivery or completion of the purchased good or service within one fiscal year . Once accepted by the contractor, a TPO is a legal ly binding contract and includes contract monitoring/management activity. 14.2.2 Contract A contract is a legally enforceable agreement between two or more parties . 14.2.3 Purchase Order (PO) A PO \u2014 or a TPO \u2014 when issued against a contract is an encumbering mechanism for payment purposes. 14.2.4 Signature Requirements A PO and contract signature document should contain at a minimum the following: a. Agency name and address ; b. Agency contract or PO number ; Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 116 c. Date of the order ; d. Term of contract (delivery period after receipt of order or beginning and ending dates of service) ; e. Contractor's name, payee/vendo r identification number, and address, including Zip Code; f. NIGP Class/Item code for each item ; g. Purchase Category Code ; and h. List of contract documents and their order of precedence: i. The \"four -corner\" contract or PO with listing of awarded items ; ii. The original solicitation documents, as modified by addenda ; iii. The proposal submitted by the contractor as modified by any best and final offer, if applicable ; iv. The assumptions and exceptions as agreed upon by the agency and the contractor, if applicable ; v. Listing of awarded items with quantity, unit of measure, and unit price with extended totals ; and vi. Signature of authorized/certified purchasing representative . 14.3 Procurement Card (State Issued Credit Card) The state issued credit card, also referred to as a procurement card (Procard) , is used for purchases within HHS programs. The goal of the program is to increase efficiencies within programs by providing a cost- effective method of purchasing and paying for goods and services while maintaining strict compliance with state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and HHS policies relating to purchasing, accounting and asset management functions. Compliance with the HHS Procurement Card Policy is MANDATORY. The Procard is only a method of payment (not a procurement method ) and does not exempt the cardholder from following state purchasing laws, CPA procurement rules and regulations , or HHS purchasing policies . PCS Purchasers are exempt from HHS Procard policy restrictions and may use the Procard for agency CAPPS requisitioned goods or services following state and federal laws, rules, regulations, and HHS policies relating to purchasing, accounting , and asset management functions. 14.4 Contract Terms 14.4.1 Essential Elements (See Comptroller's Guide, Legal Elements of a Contract ) As set out in the Comptroller's Guide, the essential elements necessary to form a binding contract are usually described as follows : a. Offer b. Acceptance c. Legal purpose d. Consideration e. Certainty of subject matter f. Competent parties Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 117 14.4.2 Essential Provisions (See Comptroller's Guide, Contract Terms ) Essential provisions that must be included in every contract are: a. Terms Necessary for the Formation of a Legally Binding Contract. The necessary elements of a contract are offer, acceptance, legal purpose, consideration, certainty of subject matter, and competent parties. Accordingly, each contract must include terms which address the following: i. Scope of work ; ii. Financial provisions (e.g., price and payment terms); iii. Contract term and termination provis ions; and iv. Identification of the contracting parties. By their nature, these terms are transaction -specifi c; therefore, the text may vary for each contract. b. Texas Required Contract Clauses. The most common statutorily required contract clauses are compiled on the list of Texas Required Contract Clauses located in the Comptroller's Guide . The Texas Required Contract Clauses are required to be included in both solicitations and contracts unless an exception is noted . c. Recommended contract clauses are included in the Comptroller's Guide and are typically included in most contract s. Recommended clauses include , but are not limited to the following: i. Administrative provisions; ii. Provisions that allocate risk and specify remedies; iii. Provisions relating to the identification and safeguarding of confidential information; and iv. Provisions relating to rights and ownership of work product and intellectual property. 14.4.3 Minimum Required Terms and Conditions At a minimum, an HHS contract must contain the following terms and conditions: a. Begin and end date; b. Description of the goods and services to be provided. c. Specific requirements such as performance measures , and/or milestones , specific remedies , and any liquidated damages. d. Data Use Agreement and Security and Privacy requirements, as applicable; e. Payment and invoicing information. f. Renewal periods , if any, available to the HHS agency including extension language: \"Following the base term and any allowable extensions, System Agency may extend any resulting Contract for not more than one additional option period to address immediate operational or service delivery needs. If the resulting Contract does not include a defined option period, the extension is limited to one year.\" This does not apply to a TPO. Best practice for TPO is to define the extension period in the contract. g. Any service level standards or agreements. h. Points of contacts and notice provisions. i. The process to change or amend the contract. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 118 j. All required and applicable affirmations and terms and conditions , both in the Comptroller's Guide and in other governing authority. k. As applicable, specific insurance requirements; l. Termination provisions; and m. Clause that states continuation is contingent on the availability of state or federal funding . In addition, contracts subject to Chapter 2261 of the Texas Government Code must include a remedies schedule, a graduated sanctions schedule, or both, for breach of the contract or substandard perfor mance under the contract;112 and when feasible, include provisions that require the contractor to carry director or officer liability insurance coverage in an amount not less than the value of the contract that is sufficient to protect the interests of the state in the event an actionable act or omission by a director or officer of the contractor damages the state's interests.113 System Contracting develops affirmation and uniform terms and conditions documents for use in contracts . 14.4.4 Contract File Documentation Note Regarding Section 2261.204 of the Texas Government Code Contracts, including grants as set forth in the statute, that are subject to Section 2261.2 04 of the Texas Government Code , are subject to specific contract file requirements : \"(a) Each state agency shall include in the contract file for each of its contracts for goods or services subject to Chapter 2261 of the Texas Government Code a written explanation of the agency's decision to include or not include in the contract a provision for liquidated damages or another form of liability for damages caused by the contractor. (b) A contract file must also include, if applicable, a written justification for any provision in the contract that limits the liability of a contractor for damages. (3) If an extension of a state agency's contract described in Subsection (a) modifies a provision for liquidated damages or another provision relating to a contractor's liability for damages, the agency must amend the written explanation or justification required by this section to include a justification for the modification. 14.4.5 Cybersecurity Training and Required Verification of Completion For contracts where the contractor will require access to a HHS computer system or database, the contractor shall comply with the requirements of Section 2054.5192 of the Texas Government Code relating to cybersecurity training and required verification of completion of the training program. Section 2054.5192 requires all applicable contractors to complete a DIR-certified cybersecurity training program during the contract term and any renewal period. Contractors may elect to complete the HHS Information Security/Cybersecurity Training program, which is a DIR-certified cybersecurity training program. HHS Information Security/Cybersecurity Training , provided as a PDF, is a duplicate of the training slide deck approved by the DIR for HHS staff. As such, reference is made to a quiz required to be completed at the end of the presentation to receive credit for the course. Contractors who elect to direct staff to complete the HHS Information Security/Cybersecurity Training should inform staff to disregard reference to the quiz, which is only applicable and accessible to HHS staff. The HHS Information Security/Cybersecurity Training program is posted at https://hhs.texas.gov/doing -business -hhs/contracting -hhs/vendor -resources (See Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 2261.101 ; State agencies shall design fair and feasible standards that will hold contractors accountable for breach of contract or substandard performance under a contract without diminishing the number of able providers who are willing to contract with the state. 113 Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 2261.102 . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 119 Except for state agencies and local governments, contractors verify completion of the requisite training by submitting Form 3834, Contractor Written Acknowledgement of Completion of Cybersecurity Training Program , to the HHS contra ct manager for upload into the SCOR Contract module, Documents submodule (see link above). State agencies and and local governments submit verification of completion of the training program to the Department of Information Resources (DIR). 14.5 Insurance When applicable, contractors should carry insurance in the types and amounts set forth in the contract or procurement document. No contract or should commence work until it has obtained the required insurance and until evidence of such insurance has been reviewed and approved by the contract manager . Insurance should be evidenced by delivery of certificates of insurance executed by the insurer or its authorized agent stating coverages, limits, expiration dates, and compliance with all applicable required provisions. The delivery timing and location should be in accordance with the procurement or contract . Additionally, it is recommended to specify in the insurance requirements of the procurement or the contract that, upon request, the contractor is required to provide, without expense, copies of the policies and all endors ements. Insurance should be written by a company licensed to do business in the State of Texas at the time the policy is issued and should be written by a company with an A.M. Best rating of A- or better. Contractor should be responsible for deductibles and self-insured retention, if any, stated in policies. All deductibles or self-insured retention should be disclosed on the certificate of insurance required above. If coverage is underwritten on a claims -made basis, the retroactive date should be coincident with the date of the contract , and the certificate of insurance should state that the coverage is claims made and include the retroactive date.114 Insurance coverage should be maintain ed for the time period set forth in the contract. Coverage, including any renewals, should have the same retroactive date as the original policy applicable to a project. Contractor s should be required \u2014 on at least an annual basis , upon any policy expiration/renewal, or upon any substantive change \u2014 to provide the contract manager with a certificate of insurance as eviden ce of insurance coverage. Insurance is the responsibility of the program area. Upon receipt of each updated certificate provided by a contractor, the certificate should be reviewed and uploaded to the official contract file in SCOR . 14.6 Bond s Pursuant to contract purchasing procedures under Section 2156.011 of the Texas Government Code , a performance bond may be required in the amount reasonable and necessary to protect the state's interest before executing the contract. Recoveries under the bond may continue until the bond is exhausted. Upon receipt, the contract manager or appropriate program staff should verify the total contract amount and the effective date of the contract to ensure that the bond is for the same amount and date. If there are any discre pancies in the value or date of a bond , it will require a revision. A review of the bond documents should include verification of the following: a. Upper left corner show s the proper county . b. Principal and insurance fields are completed . c. Contract amount is completed. d. Course of work, project number, etc. are completed. 114 Certain contracts may have projects or work orders that continue past the contract end date. Program should work closely with their contract attorney to in clude requirements concerning insurance coverage after termination of the base contract as needed for the specific contract and work at issue. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 120 e. Bond is dated and signe d by the principal and surety. f. Bond has the corporate emboss ed seal (per carrier indicated). g. Bond has a current power of attorney and has the corporate embossed seal (per carrier indicated). h. Bond has the claim notice (per carrier indicated). i. Eligibility and bonding capacity of surety companies : i. Verify certification with the U.S. Department of Treasury (DOT) : A. http://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/ref/suretyBnd/c570_a -z.htm . B. Verify that the company is listed on the DOT's list of certified surety companies and that the company is permitted to do business in Texas. C. Print the bonding company's information for the official contract file. ii. Verify eligibility with National Association Insurance Commissioners https://naic.org/cis_consumer_information.htm . iii. Enter the first surety company's name into the search field. iv. Verify that the surety company is licensed in the State of Texas. If it is, the company will be marked as \"Active\" or \"Eligible.\" v. Click on the company's name. This will take you to a detailed information page that includes contact information, financial status, complaint history, etc. vi. Print all pages and attach to the official contrac t file. vii. Verify the underwriting limitation does not exceed the bonding capacity by the \"Required 10% .\" j. The total dollar amount on the bonds must be less than the \"Required 10%.\" If not, then the bonds and insurance are rejected and shall be escalated to the CQC Insurance Analyst with supporting documentation, including the contract. k. Once reviewed and verified, the original bond package , due diligence paperwork, and any correspondence should be placed in the official contract file. 14.6.1 Bid Bonds A bid bond is a form of security deposit that is held by the agency until the awarded vendor provides the minimum required insurance and executes the contract. A bid or security bond is the financial guarantee by the respondent that the: a. Response is financially sound; b. Response was submitted in good faith ; and c. Respondent accepts the solicitation requirements and is prepared to accept the contract award. The amount of the bid bond is typically 5 percent of the total bid/proposal amount. Technically, bid bonds submitted by unsuccessful respondents expire upon award of the project to a successful respondent. Bid bonds that are submitted by respondents that are in the form of a surety or blanket bond do not require return to respondents. Bid bonds that are submitted by respondents that are in the form of a cashier's or certified check or irrevocable letter of credit do require return via certified mail with required receipt of acceptance. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 121 14.6.1.1 Acceptable Bid Bond Submission Acceptable methods for submitting a bid bond are: a. Cashier's check; b. Certified check or irrevocable letter of credit from a financial institution subject to the laws of Texas ; or c. Surety or blanket bond issued from a surety company chartered or authorized to do business in the State of Texas and acceptable to the agency . 14.6.1.2 Bid Bond Forfeiture Forfeiture of bid bonds is a policy decision and should never occur without DEC approval. Forfeiture of bid bonds occur when the successful/awarded respondent either: a. Refuses to execute the contract as presented in the solicitatio n; or b. Withdraws for no reason other than for personal benefit. This does not include unsuccessful negotiation or value engineering outcomes, or allowance by the purchaser for a respondent's request for withdrawal. 14.6.2 Construction Performance and Payment Bonds Chapter 2253 of the Texas Government Code governs performance and payment bonds in public works projects. Section 2253.001(4) of the Texas Government Code defines a \"public work contract\" to mean \"a contract for const ructing, altering, or repairing a public building or carrying out or completing any public work.\" Section 2253.002 of the Texas Government Code expressly exempts from the requirements of this chapter the following public works contracts: those associated with actions relatin g to (i) cleanup of certain hazardous waste facilities, Health and Safety Code Chapter 361, Subch apter F; (ii) enforcement of orders under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, Health and Safety Code Chapter 361, Subch apter I; and (iii) underground and aboveground storage tanks, Water Code Chapter 26, Subchapter I. 14.6.2.1 General Requirements Section 2253.021(a) of the Texas Government Code, mandates that a governmental entity, including a state agency, that enters into a public works contract with a prime contractor must require execution of a performance bond when the contract exceeds $100,000.00 and of a payment bond when the contract exceeds $25,000.00. This requirement must be satisfied prior to commencement of work under the contract. Section 2253.021 (b)-(c) of the Texas Government Code expressly delineate the purpose and terms of performance and payment bonds, respectively. Performance bonds are exclusively for the protection of the state agency that awards the public work contract and are conditioned upon good -faith performance of the work according to project plans, specifications, and contract documents. In contrast, payment bonds protect and may be used by entities that have a \"direct contractual relationship with the prime contractor or a subcontractor\" to supply labor or material for a public works project , Section 2253.021(c)(1) of the Texas Government Code Both types of bonds must be written to provi de coverage for the full amount of the contract , Section 2253.021(b)(2), (c)(2) of the Texas Government Code . 14.6.2.2 Additional Requirements Section 2253.021 of the Texas Government Code requires bonds to be executed by a corporate surety in accordance with Chapter 3503, Subchapter A of the Texas Insurance Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 122 Code, made paya ble to the state, and written on a form that the Attorney General has approved , Section 2253.021(d),115 (e) of the Texas Government Code . Section 2253.021 of the Texas Government Code also specifies the contents that must be displayed on the face of the bond or in an attachment, such as: \"(1) the name, mailing address, physical address, and telephone number, including the area code, of the surety company to which any notice of claim should be sent; or (2) the toll-free telephone number maintained by the Texas Department of Insurance under Subchapter B, Chapter 521, Insurance Code, and a statement that the address of the surety company to which any notice of claim should be sent may be obtained from the Texas Department of Insurance by calling the toll-free telephone number ,\" Section 2253 .021(f) of the Texas Government Code . Finally, Section 2253.021(g) of the Texas Government Code prohibits a governmental entity from requiring that a contractor obtain the required surety bond from a particular insurance or surety company, agent, or broker. Moreover, Section 2253.022 of the Texas Government Code extends these bond requirements to an insurance company that is fulfilling its obligation by arranging for loss replacement, rather than by a cash payment directly to the governmental entity; these requirements, however, do not extend to a surety company who is complying with an obligation under a bond that had been issued for the benefit of the governmental entity. In the event a state agency does not obtain a payment bond as required by the chapter, the agency essentially takes on the liability of a surety. Section 2253.027(a)(1) of the Texas Government Code expressly provides that the state agency assumes the same liability that a surety would have if the payment bond had been issued and presented to the entity. Also, Section 2253.027(a)(2) of the Texas Government Code permits a payment bond beneficiary to assert a lien on money due to the prime contractor in the same manner and to the same extent as liens asserted under Chapter 53 of the Texas Property Code governing mechanic's, contractor's, or materialman's lien. 14.6.2.3 Third Party Right to Copy of Payment Bond and Contract Chapter 2253 of the Texas Government Code also addresses a contract party's right to bond information and creates a corresponding obligation on the governmental entity to furnish such information , Section 2253.026 of the Texas Government Code . Subchapter C establishes various notice requirements among the contracting parties, and Subchapter D provides for claims against the required performance and payment bonds. In particular, Section 2253.071 of the Texas Government Code authorizes withholding final payment to a contractor until final completion if the contractor abandons the contract or the contractor's default results in termination of the contract. According to Section 2253.072 of the Texas Government Code , the state has no liability for costs or expenses of litigation arising from a payment bond. Section 2253.073 permits suits on payment bonds by a beneficiary seeking the unpaid balance due; and Sections 2253.073 and 2253.074 of the Texas Government Code provide a basis for the recovery of attorney's fees. Subchapter D further addresses assignment of claims against a payment bond, restricts the maximum recovery to the amount of the subcontract, and establishes venue as any county in which work was located . Section 2253.078 of the Texas Government Code imposes a 1-year statute of limitations for suits on a payment bond from the date notice for a claim is mailed in accordanc e with Chapter 2253 , and a 1-year statute of limitations for suits on a performance bond from the date of final completion, abandonment, or termination of 115 Article 7.19 -1, Vernon's Texas Insurance Code was repealed in 2005 and codified as Subchapter A of Chapter 3503 , Texas Insurance Code. Acts 2005, 79th Leg., ch. 727, \u00a7 3 (adding ch. 3503), 18(a)(5) 2005 Tex. Gen. Laws 1752, 2156 - 57, 2187. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 123 the public work contract. Finally, Section 2253.079 of the Texas Government Code makes it a criminal offense to file a false and fraudulent claim against a bond required under Chapter 2253 . 14.7 Prevailing Wage Rates Chapter 2258 of the Texas Government Code , construction of a public work , including a building, highway, road, excavation, and repair work or other project development or improvement, paid for in whole or in part from public funds, without regard to whether the work is done under public supervision or direction. The chapter does not apply to work done directly by a public utility under an order of a public authority. Subchapter B of Chapter 2258 addresses the payment of prevailing wage rates, including workers ' rights, determinations of prevailing wage rates depending on the geographic location of the work site, payment of prevailing wage rates by subcontractors, and recordkeeping. An agency contracting for the construction of a public work \u2014 including a building, highway, road, excavation, and repair work or other project development or improvement paid for in whole or in part from public funds \u2014 must determine the general prevailing rate of per diem wages in the locality in which the public work is to be performed for each craft or type of worker needed to execute the contract (including the prevailing rate for legal holiday and overtime work). An agency may make its prevailing wage rate determination by conducting a survey of the wages received by classes of workers employed on projects of a character similar to the contract work in the political subdivision of the state in which the public work is to be performed , or by using the prevailing wage rate as determined by the United States Department of Labor in accordance with the Davis -Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. Section 276a et seq.) and its subsequent amendments. Chapter 2258 includes specific requirements for determining prevailing wage rates for a public work located in a county bordering the United Mexican States or in a county adjacent to a county bordering the United Mexican States . Any solicitation related to a contract for construction of a public work project and the contract itself must include the appropriate wage rate determination for the project. The bidder to whom the contract is awarded , and all of its subcontractors are required to pay wages of at least the rates contained within the wage rate determination for the project. Subchapter C of Chapter 2258 provides for enforcement and civil and criminal penalties related wage rate complaints : \"(a) On receipt of information, including a complaint by a worker, concerning an alleged violation of Section 2258.023 by a contractor or subcontractor, a public body shall make an initial determination as to whether good cause exists to believe that the violation occurred ; (b) A public body must make its determination under subsection (a) before the 31st day after the date the public body receives the information ; (c) A public body shall notify in writing the contractor or subcontractor and any affected worker of its initial determination ; (d) A public body shall retain any amount due under the contract pending a final determination of the violation. \" Subchapter C also includes arbitration, payment, and withholding provisions. 14.8 Uniform General Conditions for Constr uction The State of Texas Uniform General Conditions for Construction Contracts (UGC) is a document adopted by the Texas Facilities Commission that, with certain exceptions, is to be incorporated into all building construction contracts made by the state. The UGCs may currently be accessed on the TFC Forms Index web page. 14.8.1 Texas Facilities Commission The UGC is published by the Texas Facilities Commission (TFC) pursuant to Section 2166.302 of the Texas Government Code . TFC is required to review the UGCs at least once every five (5) years. As defined by Article 16, Miscellaneous, par. 16.1 Supplementary General and Special Conditions, in between official review of the UGC by TFC, the agency may issue supplementary general conditions to the UGC and special conditions to address specific and provisionary conditions pertaining to the site and/or project . The review of the UGCs by TFC includes participation of a committee appointed by TFC. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 124 14.8.2 HHSC Construction Documents For HHSC construction projects solicited under the authority of Chapter 2269 of the Texas Government Code , HHSC incorporates the UGC into a contract document titled \"Texas Uniform Conditions for Construction Projects with HHSC Supplementary Condit ions.\" This contract document not only incorporates the State of Texas UGCs , but also includes a required section for specifying liquidated damages and/or any other agency -required or agency -specific supplementary conditions. 14.9 Grant Awards A grant is a financial award provided by the state or federal government to an eligible grantee (subrecipient or recipient). When HHS has applied for and/or received federal funds, it awards those funds as a pass -through entity to subrecipients. In some instances, the Texas Legislature appropriates state general revenue to an agency to award in grants. In those instances, the organization receiving grant funds from HHS as the awarding agency is the recipient. It is the policy of HHS that the HHSC Federal Funds Manager review and approve all federal funding plans for HHS services in Texas. HHSC is responsible for establishing business processes to coordinate and monitor the use of federal funds received by HHS agencies. This includes ensuring that HHS agencies have access to federal funds information for their programs . Recipient and subrecipient grantees are responsible for the administration and financial management of all funds and resources received from HHS. Grantees are to comply with and follow all applicable federal and state laws, rules, and regulations in the administration of grant awards from federal or state sources. Grantees must also comply with HHS rules, policies, and procedures, including any specified terms in the grant agreement . The executed grant agreement between HHS and a grantee, including all attachments, exhibits, and resources referenced in the contract, govern s the relationship between the parties. 14.9.1 Required Information Pursuant to UGG, grant awards that awar d federal funds are required to include the following information in the executed grant agreement . Grant agreements awarding state funds should generall y include the same information, with the exception of non-applicable federal information. a. Grantee Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number or Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) b. Federal Award Identification Number (FAIN) c. Federal Award Date d. State award period of performance start and end date e. State award budget period start and end date f. Amount of federal funds obligated to subrecipient by HHS g. Total amount of the federal award committed to the subrecipient by HHS h. Federal award project description i. i. Name of Federal Awarding Agency j. State Awarding Official Contact Information k. Assistance Listing Number and Program Title (list all that apply) l. Identification of whether the award is for research and development m.

Requirements of the federal award passed down by HHS to subrecipient in order for HHS to meet its responsibility to federal awarding agency o. Terms and conditions related to closeout of the state award 14.9.2 Federal Uniform Grant Guidance (UGG) In December 2013, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) published Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards , 2 CFR Part 200. This Uniform Grant Guidance (UGG) consolidated grant -related guidance and implemented efficiency and effective grant reforms. The reforms are the result of several executive orders to reduce administrative burdens and increase flexibility, while targeting improper payments and improving program performance. Effective December 2014, UGG applies to HHS federal grants as grant terms expire and new grants are issued. The UGG has implications for all aspects of HHS agency operations including accounting, budgeting, information technology, and grant monitoring and oversight. The UGG covers administrative requirements, cost principles, and audit requirements, among others. Key elements of UGG include: a. Integrating and streamlining eight OMB circulars into one set; b. Providing a set of uniform definitions for federal assistance; c. Creating exceptions for innovative programs; d. Replacing \"vendor\" with , \"contractor ;\" e. Requiring pre-award consideration of merit and risk; f. Providing consistency on negotiated indirect cost rates; g. Streamlining and clarifyin g guidance on subrecipient monitoring; h. Strengthening internal controls while providing administrative flexibility; i. Using a risk-based approach towards single audits and raising audit threshold to $750K; j. Strengthening audit follow -up by requiring greater accountability; and k. Simplifying reporting requirements while strengthening internal controls. 14.9.3 State Uniform Grant Management Standards State funded grants must be administered according to the State's Uniform Grant Management Standards (TxGMS ) or its successor, published by CPA. TxGMS was established to promote efficient use of public funds through a standardized set of financial management procedures and definitions. The CPA develops and maintains TxGMS . 14.10 Coordination and Preparation of Contract Documents The contract manager is responsible for the coordination and preparation of the appropriate contract agreement and related documents. HHS staff must not adopt terms and conditions from another contract, even a boilerplate, without a thor ough and independent review of how those terms and conditions relate to the specific procurement and contract at issue . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 126 14.10.1 Contract Manager Responsibilities PCS Operating Procedure 211 The contract manager will: a. Coordinate with System Contracting to ensure the mandatory terms and conditions are incorporated into the contract , coordinating as necessary with agency SMEs and appropriate OCC attorneys . b. Coordinate with the OCC Data Governance Legal to determine whether the contractor will access confidential information if uncertain and ensure the Data Use Agreement (DUA) or OCC Data Governance attorney approved language has been incorporated into the contract . c. Coordinate with PCS to ensure: i. Necessary procurement documents like responses, negotiations, SOW , performance measures, and any other pertinent documents, are included in the contract; ii. For major information technology projects with a maximum potential contract value of at least $10 milli on, that the proposed terms of the contract before starting negotiations and the final negotiated unsigned contract are provided to QAT for review ; and iii. OAG review for contracts equal to or greater than $250 million (see PCS Operating Procedure 211, Request for Office of the Attorney General \"880\" Review ). d. Upon award of the contract (applicable to contracts that mandated the inclusion of a HUB Subcontracting Plan (HSP) with the solicitation response), the HUB Program Office will contact the contract manager to accomplish the following prior to the contract manager initiating or providing the Notice -to-Proceed to the contractor . e. Schedule a HUB -Post -Contract -Award Meeting with the contractor within 10 days of the contract award notification. f. Provide a copy of the 34 TAC \u00a7 20.285 outlining HUB compliance requirements throughout the duration of the contract and require the contractor to implement the HSP in good faith. g. Ensure the contractor notifies all of the HSP subcontractors (both HUB and Non -HUB) within 10 days of the contract award and provides supporting documentation of the notifications for the contract file. h. Ensure any needed updates to the HSP are done in accordance with 34 TAC \u00a7 20.285 and are reflected on the PCS Form 510. i. Provide guidance to the contractor for any future changes to the HSP that requires compliance with the good faith effort requirements and must obtain prior approval from the agency (HUB Program and program area) prior to engaging a new subcontractor. Note, engaging a contractor without prior approval may be considered a breach of contract. j. Provide guidance to the contractor on the submission of the Progress Assessment Report (PAR) with the invoice as required as condition of payment. This includes submitting a copy to the HUB_PAR@hhsc.state.tx.us mailbox for tracking and reporting. k. Solidify the HSP Contract Provision on the PCS Form 510, HUB Post Contract Award Form and require the contractor's signature. Obtain HHS signatures: The HUB Coordinator signs the PCS Form 510 and submits to the contract manager for signature. l. Upload the documents in SCOR: The HUB Coordinator forwards all the HUB Post Contract Award documents to the contractor manager to upload in SCOR under the \"HUB Subcontracting Plan\" document type. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 127 m. Upload all the contract documents as an attachment for the contract. (If the file sizes are large, compress the documents into a zip file). Then upload the requisition, request document, and Form PCS 515 as separate files. Within the zip folder, the files should still adhere to the file naming convention. The file order in CAPPS should be as follows: i. Contract Signature Document ii. Contract attachments iii. Completed PCS Form 515 iv. Request Document v. Requisition vi. Other supporting documentation (such as legal approval email) n. Ensure the contract addresses concerns or issues raised during review. 14.10.2 Review of Draft Contract The contract manager must review the draft contract for content and accuracy to include: a. Contractor name: The contractor name on the contract and all required forms is the complete and correct legal name of the entity; b. Signature authority : The individual designated to sign the contract on behalf of the contractor and the HHS agency are authorized to bind the party in contracting decisions; c. Contract attachments/ forms: All required attachments/ forms are included with the contract, as applicable: i. The appropriate affirmations and contract terms and conditions ii. The solicitation document iii. The contractor's response iv. Any negotiated changes v. Required budget documents vi. A Data Use Agreement (DUA) and complete Security and Privacy Inquiry vii. Other required forms (e.g., the Certification Regarding Lobbying form required for contracts, grants, loans, and cooperative agreements that utilize federal funds.) viii. Contractor Written Acknowledgement of Completion of Cybersecurity Training Program, Form 3834. d. Payment and invoicing information : If there is a total dollar amount it must be correct, and budgets must be calculated accurately and include invoicing information approved by the HHSC Account s Payable ; and e. Effective dates: The effective begin and end dates are specified and correct. 14.10.3 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)/Food & Nutrition Services (FNS) Reviews In determining the procurement timeline, special consideration must be given to CMS/FNS reviews as they could add 120 days or more to the procurement process. CMS/FNS reviews are a series of a two -part federal review and approval pro cess that is required for certain procurements when they receive federal funding. The program area works directly with their Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 128 respective Fed/State coordinators to develop an Advanced Planning Document (APD). The APD goes through several layers of internal a pprovals prior to being sent to CMS/FNS. The first initial 60 -day review must occur prior to posting. This review contains a draft of the RFO with an estimate of costs and gives CMS an overview of what is being procured and the mechanism used to do so. If approved, CMS/FNS will issue an approval letter to program that must be received prior to the solicitation being posted on the ESBD. The initial review can occur simultaneously with CAT review and other PALTS milestones. The second and final 60 -day review is after vendor selection and prior to award. CMS must review and approve the final contract prior to it being routed through DocuSign for signature. Please note this review cannot run simultaneously with other PALTS milestones. Occasionally, CMS may issue a Request for Additional Information (RAI) if they feel there are items missing from the APD, or if they need additional clarification. RAIs restart the 60 -day review period once the program area provides the information to CMS. It is the p rogram area 's responsibility to initiate the review and approval process and to notify PCS of this requirement during the kick -off meeting. Reference Section 7.1 regarding Procurem ent Lead Times , for more information . 14.11 Certification Regarding Lobbying The Certification Regarding Lobbying form is required for contracts, grants, loans, and cooperative agreements that utilize federal funds (available in the CAPPS template library ). The Certification Regarding Lobbying is required once during the life of the contract. If any federal lobbying reporting becomes necessary, a Disclosure of Lobbying Activities Form (SF-LLL) should be provided by the contractor. Any forms received should be uploaded into the SCOR Documents submodule or mainta ined within a contract management file. 14.12 Required Screening for Potential Contractors 14.12.1 Vendor Checks HHS agencies must demonstrate due diligence to ensure vendors and grantees (Including both subrecipient and recipient relationships) are eligible to do business with the State of Texas before contract award. Vendor check activities must be documented at the time they are performed, and records maintained in SCOR. This policy applies to all contracts except governmental entities and governmental institutio ns of higher education. Consult with assigned attorney or System Contracting if further clarification is needed regarding applicability of vendor checks. When a PCS purchaser is involved in the procurement, the assigned PCS purchaser performs all required vendor checks , except for program -specific vendor checks , and maintain supporting documentation. If, for any reason, vendor checks are delegated to another individual to conduct, the purchaser or contract manager, as applicable, must ensure the checks have been completed and required documentation uploaded. Vendor checks are completed before any contract award, extension, renewal, and in conjunction with contractor organizational changes , see 16.18.7 Ownership or Name Change for reference, when the Texas Id entification Number (TIN) changes. Program areas may elect to establish policies to conduct checks at other key contract activities, such as monitoring. Procedural information is available on the Vendor Checks Job Aid. The Vendor Checks Job Aid, which includes a check list, provides the necessary steps for staff to perform each vendor check. The Vendor Checks Job Aid was developed to aid divisions that procure and manage contracts in complying with general HHS vendor check and documentation Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 129 requirements. However, the Ve ndor Checks Job Aid does not address program, solicitation, or contract specific vendor checks that may be required pursuant to applicable law or other governing source and programs must ensure all checks are properly and timely completed and documented. Divisions that procure and manage contracts must utilize the Vendor Checks Job Aid and checklist tools or, if using different tools must ensure alignment with the established requirements (steps and applicability), compiled and outlined in the Vendor Checks Job Aid and checklist. Also , the contract manager must complete and document any additional vendor checks not included on this tool/job aid, but required pursuant to HHS or program policy, program rule or other applicable law, or contract requirement. Before contract execution, the purchaser or program area, whichever is applicable, must access and search various databases to screen a vendor's eligibility to conduct business with the State of Texas to include: a. Texas Identification Number (TIN) - Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts ; b. Warrant/Payment Hold - Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts ; c. Franchise Tax Account Status - Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts ; d. Texas Debarred Vendor List - Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts ; e. System for Award Management (SAM) - Federal Exclusion s; f. OFAC Sanctions Lists including the SDN List - Federal Exclusions; g. Federal HHS OIG List of Excluded Individuals and Entities - Federal Exclusions ; h. Texas Office of Inspector General Exclusions Database - Texas Exclusion s; i. Texas Legislative Prohibitions : Divestment Statute Lists - Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts ; and j. Vendor Performance Tracking System (VPTS) . The warrant/payment hold check and the System for Award Management (SAM) Check (Federal Exclusions Search) must be performed not earlier than the seventh day before the date of contract or purchase order execution and not later than the date of contract or purchase order execution. NOTE: For competitive procurements processed by PCS, an initial warrant hold and SAM checks are conducted by PCS Purchaser prior to contract negotiations. An additional warrant hold and SAM check must be performed within seven (7) days prior to award. If contract execution takes longer than seven (7) days, an additional warran t hold and SAM check must be performed. If an issue is identified staff may refer to the Vendor Checks Job Aid and Section 15.21 regarding Escalation of Contract Issues , to determine the appropriate course of action. HHS staff must maintain documentation to support the outcome of all vendor checks and any escalation communication in SCOR. See also, Section 14.12.2 regarding Additi onal Vendor Checks, Section 15.9 regarding Contractor and Grantee Screening Post -Award Checks, Section 15.19.7 regarding Ownership or Name Change, and Section 15.21 regarding Escalation of Contract Issues. 14.12.2 Additio nal Vendor Checks Staff are required to complete vendor checks in accordance with federal, state, and agency requirements. Any additional vendor checks required by applicable law, program policy, program rule, contract requirement, or other governing autho rity must be completed and documented. Below are some examples of additional vendor checks that may be required, although this may not be an all-inclusive list. Consult with program management and, if necessary, OCC Legal Policy for questions Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 130 on required a dditional checks or OCC System Contracting for issues with the potential vendor's eligibility. a. Criminal History Check: If applicable, verify the owners and related parties associated with a legal entity do not have a criminal conviction that would prohibit the HHS agency from contracting with the legal entity ; b. Employability Status Check: If licensed by HHSC Regulatory Services, verify each owner or partner/board member/managing employee/controlling person is not identified in the Nurse Aide Registry as revoked or the Employee Misconduct Registry. The check can be conducted at the Department of Aging and Disability Services Employability Status Check Search ; and c. Licensure/Certification: If the legal entity is required to be licensed or certified, verify the license/facility identification number, and license/certification expiration date 14.13 Disclosure of Interested Parties In accordance with Section 2252.908 of the Texas Government Code , disclosure of interested parties applies to a contract with a value of $1 million or more , a contract that requires an action or vote by the governing body or a contract that is for services that would require a person to register as a lobbyist under Texas Government Code Chapter 305.116 Exemptions to the requirement are: a. A sponsored research contract of an institution of higher education; b. An interagency contract of a state agency or an institution of higher education; c. A contract related to health and human services if: i. The value of the contract cannot be determined at the time the contract is executed; and ii. Any qualified vendor is eligible for the contract; d. Contracts with publicly -traded business entity, including a wholly owned subsidiary of the business entity; and e. Contracts with electric utility or gas utilit y, as those terms are defined in the statute . The Texas Ethics Commission (TEC) is the state agency with the administrative duty over this requirement. TEC rules governing this requirement are located in Title 1, Chapter 46 of the TAC. Additional information, Form 1295 , Certificate of Interested Parties , and an online filing application (Form 1295 Electronic Filing Application ) are located on the TEC's website at www.ethics.state.tx.us . If vendors are required to complete Form 1295 , Certificate of Interested Parties, it must be filed with the TEC and acknowledged by the contracting agency before the agency may sign the contract. The information reported by a contracting entity on the Certificate of Interested Parties form submitted in support of an HHS contract may require revision during the term of the HHS contract. If a change to the disclosure of interested parties should occur or if an amendment or extension of a contract would require disclosure , the contractor must complete Form 1295 , Certificate of Interested Parties to reflect the updated information. The new Form 1295 is submitted to the HHS contract manager, who must acknowledge receipt of the form using the TEC online acknowledgement within 30 calendar days from HHS receipt of the filed 1295, and upload it into the SCOR Contract module, Document submodule . 116 Texas Government Code Section 2252.908(b) was amended during the 86th Legislative Session to apply disclosure of interested parties to a contract for services that would require a person to register as a lobbyist under Chapter 305 of the Texas Government Code. The amendment was effective June 14, 2019 . (The section was amended by both House Bill 1495 and Senate Bill 65. House Bill 1495 was effective June 14, 2019 and Senate Bill 65 was effective September 1, 2019.) Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 131 TEC posts the completed Form 1295 to its website within seven business days after receiving the HHS agency's acknowledgement and sends confirmation to PCS. Additional information may be found on the TEC website. 14.14 Contract Award 14.14.1 Notification of Contract Award In the following cases, HHS must provide notice of contract awards (each notice is in addition to other applicable notices listed) : a. ESBD : If the maximum potential contract value exceeds $25,000.00, the notice of award is posted to the ESBD. Proof of the ESBD posting is maintained in the procurement file. b. QAT : If an award of a major information resources project, notice is provided to the QAT within 10 business days of award. c. LBB:117 Contracts which meet a certain threshold, unless exempt, are reported through the LBB Contracts Database , subject to specific timelines : i. Maximum potential contract value greater than $50,000.00 for construction, professional services or consulting services contracts; ii. Maximum potential contract value greater than $50,000.00 for all other contract types; iii. Maximum potential contract value greater than $100,000.00 for major information systems; iv.

For contracts not posted to the LBB contracts database, HHS System Agencies must post each DIR SOW118 entered into by HHS and contracts for the purchase of goods or services from a private vendor with a maximum potential contract value greater than $0. iii. State law requires Texas state agencies to publish the purpose of each grant exceeding $25,000 awarded from state appropr iations on their websites. The CPA's office must post a list of links to the grant information displayed on the agencies' websites . e. Respondents : HHS may choose to send written notice of non-selection. NOTE: Different oversight agencies may not use the same standard for determining contract value. For example, the contract value for SPD reporting, review, and delegation requirements (see Section 7.5 regarding Contract Value Estimate ) is defined differently than for LBB reporting purposes, or IT commodity purchases under DIR contracts. 117 Additional information is available on the LBB Website . 118 Tex.

Without issuing a request for proposal, request for bid, or other similar process common to participation in the competitive bidding processes required by statute, rule, or ordinary and commonly recognized state policies and procedures. Enrollments under $10 million are excluded from the attestation requirement. Contract documents include the solicitation, contract, amendments and for major consulting contracts, a finding of fact memo from the Governor's Office (Reference Section 9.9.2 regarding Notice of Intent and Finding of Fact ). Notification is provided by uploading all the required information into the LBB Contracts Database. 14.14.2.2 LBB Attestation Letter Procedure As applicable, HHS program staff must complete the appropriate PCS Form 805, PCS Form 806, DSHS Form 807, or DSHS Form 808 (LBB Attestation Letter ) and initiate routing it when the contract or amendment is routed for signature. A new contract may not move forward to execution if the LBB Attestation Letter form routing has not been initiated. Form s PCS 805, PCS 806, DSHS 807 and DSHS 808 are power form s accessed and routed from the HHS Connection intranet site. Each provides: a. A description of the contract; b. Certification concerning the process used to award the contract; and c. Certification concerning management controls. Separate certifications are required for contract award and contract management when separate HHS divisions and agencies are responsible for procurement, contracting functions , and contract management . However, when a single HHS division is responsible for procurement, contracting functions and contract management, one certification is 119 GAA , S.B. 1, 87th Leg., R.S., art. IX, sec. 7.11(a). Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 133 required to satisfy the requirements of Article IX, Section 7.11 of the GAA.

Notice is provided by uploading the action memo approved by the HHS Executive Commissioner , and the same documentation required for an attestation letter in the LBB Contracts Database. Some bridge extensions may not have an attestation letter. (Reference Section 14.14.2.1 regarding LBB Contracts Database , and Section 15.19.1 regarding Bridge Extensions ). See PCS Operating Procedure 7 54, Bridge Extension s. 14.14.4 Contract Award Certification 14.14.4.1 PCS Procurement Process The DEC for PCS will review the procurement process used to award the contract and, if appropriate, certify that the process used was consistent with: a. The Comptroller's Guide; and b. All applicable statutes, rules, policies and procedures related to procurement and contracting of goods and services, including compliance with conflict of interest disclosure requirements. 14.14.4.2 Non -PCS Procurement If PCS did not manage the procurement, the DEC for the program area responsible for the procurement shall complete the attestation for contract award. Contract award activity for which program area is regularly responsible includes: a. Provider enrollments; b. Affiliation agreements; c. Interagency agreements; and d. MOAs /MOUs . 14.14.5 Contract Management Certification The DEC for the program area or DSHS or DFPS Commissioner or their designee for the area responsible for contract monitoring, management, and oversight will certify the program has an effective process and adequate management controls to: a. Verify vendor performance and deliverables for the contract; b. Only pay for goods and services that are within the scope of the contract or procurement; and c. Calculate and collect any liquidated damages associated with vendor performance. If the responsible DEC or Commissioner is unable to make certification, they must work with System Contracting to determine if the requirements of Article IX, Section 7.11 of the GAA are inapplicable 120 GAA , S.B. 1, 87th Leg., R.S., art. IX, sec. 17.09(e)(2), (3). Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 134 or if a legal justification exists for the alternative process. If a legal justification is identified, the DEC will certify the alternative process used, identify the individual(s) directing the use of that alternative process , and document this in the attachment to the attestation letter. The DEC for PCS and the program area or agency commissioner responsible for the contract will work together to provide any other information requested by the LBB. It is the responsibility of PCS to upload the solicitation, contract , and the required attestation letter (Reference Section 14.14.2 regarding LBB Notification \u2014Attestation Letters ) into the LBB Portal before the first payment under a contract will be made, but no later than 30 calendar days after the date the contract is awarded . For an emergency procurement, the solicitation, contract , and Form PCS 805 must be uploaded within 48 hours of making a payment. At least 30 calendar days prior to extending an existing contract beyond the base term and optional extensions provided for in the contract, PCS provides notice of the extension by uploading the approved extension memo and documents specified in Article IX, Section 7.11(d) of the GAA to the LBB contracts database , regardless of whether the documents are otherwise required to be uploaded to that database. Failure to satisfy the notification requirements of Article IX, Section 7.11 of the GAA could result in enhanced monitoring by the LBB, auditing by the State Auditor's Office, required agency consultation with the QAT and/or CAT, or contract cancellation. 14.14.6 Other Certifications PCS Form 08, or PCS Form O8 -G for grants, is used to document certification of the following by the procurement director, or designee: a. Contracts with a Value Exceeding $5 Million : Pursuant to Texas Government Code Section 2261.255(1) , the solicitation and purchasing methods and contractor selection process complied with state law and agency policy. b.

See also, Section 13.2.3.5 regarding Certification of Vendor Assessment Process . The completed PCS 08, or PCS 08_G for grants, must be included with supportin g documentation attached to PCS Form 515 used for contract review, approval, and execution. The approved PCS Form 08, or PCS Form 08 -G, must be maintained in the procurement file, and is uploaded into the SCOR, Procurement module. 14.14.7 Delegated Signature Authority Pursuant to Chapter 531 of the Texas Government Code, and Chapter 1001 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, the HHSC Executive Commissioner is responsible for all HHS agencies' purchasing and contracting. Both chapters 531 of the Texas Government Code and 1001 of the Texas Health and Safety Code authorize the Executive Commiss ioner to delegate specific powers and duties relating to contracts in order to facilitate HHS agency operations. This policy applies to all HHS agencies' binding and non-binding commitments reduced to writing, including but not limited to: a. Contracts , including when the HHS agency is the performing agency or recipient of funds (revenue generating); b. MOU s; c. MOA s; Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 135 d. IACs ; e. Grants and grant applications; f. Amendments (e.g., renewals, extensions, budget adjustments, etc.); g. POs not associated with a signed contract; and h. Binding and non-binding commitments that require the execution of an agreement, contract or amendment. HHS Circular C-046, Approval and Signature Authority for HHS Agency Contracts , defines and clarifies delegation of approval and signature authority and threshold limits for HHS agency contracts. PCS maintains a copy of the HHS agency delegated signature authority and related approval documentation and posts the HHS agency delegated signature authority matrices on the HHS Procurement and Contracting page of the HHS Connection . 14.14.8 Changes to Signature Authority It is important to maintain a current list of names of persons with signature authority at all times . When a staff change occurs in a specific job position that has signature authority, the management authority over the vacated position must email a notice of the change to PCS Level 1 at PCS_Level_1_Support@hhsc.state.tx.us . Notice of the change is sent as soon as possible, preferably at least five business days before the effective date of the proposed change, and must include the: a. Name and job title of the person who no longer has the job title/position . b. Name and job title of the person assuming the job title/position; and c. Effective date of the change. 14.14.9 PCS Form 515, Routing Request and Electronic Signature of Contracts It is the policy of the Health and Human Services Commission that HHS agencies may accept electronically signed records, including records transmitted electronically by fax or email, and scanned documents that are attached to emails, as valid signatures for contracts (HHS Circular C - 038, Guidelines for the Acceptance of Electronically Transmitted and Electronically Signed Contract Records ). DocuSign is a tool used by many program areas to obtain electronic signatures from the vendor and the HHS signature authority to execute a contract. Only individuals with signature authority will be given DocuSign accounts. Program staff must complete PCS Form 515.121 The purpose of PCS Form 515 is to direct HHS contracts, work orders, amendments, renewals, and extensions through approval routing of the proposed contract documents. This form is completed for any document requiring CAPPS Financials approval routing and for all DocuSign signature routing. The requester shall adhere to any HHS Circular -046 requirements (HHS Circular C-046, Approval and Signature Authority for HHS Agency Contracts ) in addition to consulting with program to complete the form prior to submission to Procurement and Contracting Services Quality Assurance (PCS QA). The information provided on the routing request form will be used by PCS QA to create the document routing approval path in CAPPS Financials as well as creating the DocuSign path for contractor signatory and HHS signatory execution. 121 Form PCS 515 meets the requirements of Tex. Gov't Code \u00a7 2261.254(c), (d). Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 136 To contact PCS regarding DocuSign, send an email to: PCS_DocuSign@hhsc.state.tx.us . 14.15 Vendor Debriefing PCS Operating Procedure 578 Debriefing is the act of informing vendors, applicants, contractors or service providers (respondent s) that participated in a particular procurement or grant of the strengths and weaknesses of their response - that is, a bid, proposal, offer, or application \u2014 relative to the advertised evaluation criteria as well as how the agency's decision complied with applicable procurement law and the published solicitation . It is not a forum to discuss the responses submitted by other respondents , or any information that may be confidential by law. Debrief meetings may not be held until after notification of contract award is publicly posted. Following the public posting of notice of contract award and upon the receipt by PCS purchaser of a request for a debrief by a respondent , a PCS team member will hold a debrief meeting with the respondents as soon as practical . 14.15.1 Grant Applicant Notifications PCS Operating Procedure 539 To ensure transparency and public confidence in HHSC's RFA process and to provide applicants with timely information on application status, it is the policy of PCS that applicants should be notified as soon as reasonably practicable following a decision made regarding their application. PCS Operating Procedure 539 includes information on roles, responsibilities, and procedures for the followin g: a. Notice of Ineligibility . b. Late applications . c. Intent to Award letters . d. Funding denial letters . e. Notice of Award; and f. Legislative inquiries. 14.15.2 Post -Award Grant Debriefing PCS Operating Procedure 580 Applicants not selected for funding after the evaluation and award process may request feedback on their application and non -selection. It is not a forum to discuss the applications submitted by other applicants or any information that may be confidential by law. Feedback is provided first through an informal discussion and then, if additional information is requested, a formal debrief meeting. Through the application feedback discussion, the applicant may obtain information as to why its application was unsuccessful so that it may apply \"lessons learned\" in future grant initiatives with the state. Similarly, the application feedback discussion provides an opportunity for the agency to obtain va luable insight, from the applicant's perspective, of the grant opportunity process. PCS Operating Procedure 580 outlines roles, responsibilities, and procedures for post -award grant debriefing. 14.16 Bid Protests Bid protests filed by a vendor who is allegedly aggrieved in connection with a solicitation, evaluation or award of a contract by HHSC shall follow the requirements set forth in Title 1, Part 15, Chapter 391 of the TAC. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook v. 1.0 137 Contract Management Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 138 15. CONTRACT MANAGEMENT Contract management begins with the creation of and execution of a contract. The objective of contract management is to ensure the responsibilities of the HHS System Agency and the contractor are properly discharged. Effective and efficient contracting requires adherence to contract management standards, and best pract ices, as well as statutes, regulations, and policies. 15.1 System of Contract Operation and Reporting (SCOR) On September 5, 2017, the HHS Contract Administration and Tracking System (HCATS) was replaced by the System of Contract Operation and Reporting (SCOR). Prior to September 5, 2017, HCATS or other contract management systems served as the official source of record for HHS agency contract information. As of September 5, 2017, SCOR is the database for all general administrative and client services procurement and contract documentation. SCOR is a single system of record for the management and reporting of contract information. SCOR is also the system of record for the final, electronic procurement file. (Procurement documents related to contracts with an effective date before May 1, 2019 remain in CAPPS or a separate file, including some paper files.) Actions related to contract establishment, contract amendments, and contract termination begin in CAPPS Financials with contract details merging into SCOR in \"real -time.\" SCOR serves as the official electronic repository for HHS System Agency procurements and contracts. Information pertaining to contracts with an end date before September 5, 2017 is available in agency -specific instances of HCATS. Procurement documents related to contracts with a begin date before May 1, 2019 remain in CAPPS or a separate file. Prior to gaining access to SCOR, HHS employees or contracted staff must complete PCS Form 130 and become familiar with the SCOR User Guide . HHS staff request access to SCOR through the HHS Portal. HHS staff should consult their supervisor to determine the appropriate SCOR security role before submitting a request to the HHS Enterprise Portal . For more information, refer to the SCOR User Guide. The SCOR Contract Manager Guide is a resource developed for contract managers to promote consistent use of SCOR and compliance to this Handbook. HHS contract managers are required to adhere to the SCOR Contract Manager Guide. HHS program areas are required to document business processes related to data entry and document upload to SCOR . Program areas should have additional business processes in place to not only verify information migrated from CAPPS to SCOR, but to make sure contract managers are complying with the requirements within SCOR in order to ensure integrity of the data. To contact the SCOR Administrator or SCOR Team, send an email to PCS_SCOR@hhsc.state.tx.us . 15.2 Contract Manager Responsibilities The contract manager is responsible for ensuring all contract requirements are satisfied, goods and services are delivered in accordance with the contract , and the financial interests of the HHS System Agency are protected. The contract manager must have a thorough understanding of the all components of the solicitation and contract to ensure the contract is performed satisfactorily and the responsibilities of the HHS System Agency and contractor are properly discharged. The primary responsibilities of a contract manager include: a. Being involved throughout each stage of the procurement and contract lifecycle; b. Serving as the primary point of contact for agency communication with the contractor regarding all matters pertaining to the contract; c. Being well versed in the contract terms, including its purpose, scope, requirements, deliverables, and milestones and ensur ing the contractor is held accountable for performance , including timeliness ; Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 139 d. Providing training and technical assistance, as needed; e. Promoting the use of best practices throughout the contract lifecycle; f. Establishing specific, time -bound performance measures and requirements to ensure contractor accountability; g. As needed, hosting a post award contractor conference to ensure all parties are aware of the performance requirements and administrative procedures agreed in the contract; h. Verifying completion of data entry into the SCOR Contract Detail sub-module and uploading contract documents into the SCOR Contract History or Documents sub-module within 10 days from the contract effective date; i.

Managing, approving , and documenting changes to the contract through the amendment process authorized by the terms of the contract; p. Identifying and resolving disputes with the contractor in a timely manner; q. Elevating to management in a timely manner dispute s or deficienc ies with the contractor's performance; r. Exercising remedies, as appropriate, when a contractor's performance is deficient ; s. Confirming service s and deliverables are complete prior to the expiration date of the contract or in accordance with the terms; t. Monitoring HUB Subcontracting Plan, if applicable ; u. Completing contract closeout processes to include, as applicable, submission of a vendor performance report (PCS Form 147) to PCS_VPTS@hhsc .state.tx.us ; and v. Complying with record retention requirements. 15.3 Contractor Training and Technical Assistance Contract managers must hold contractors accountable for ensuring compliance with state and federal regulations, contract terms and conditions, and protecting the state's financial interest. Communication is essential for a successful partnership; providing training and technical assistance to contractors may be necessary for overseeing compliance, supporting successful contract outcomes, and more transparent expectations. 15.3.1 Training for Contractors Contract managers and agency staff may provide training to contractors to address program requirements, HUB contract compliance, reporting requirements, changes in agency policies, or to meet state and federal requirements. Contract managers should coordinate with their agency leadership regarding curriculum, materials, presenters, training dates, and locations. The contract manager must ensure training is adequately documented to include the following items and uploaded into the SCOR Documents sub-module: Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 140 a. Date, time , and location of training; b. Sign-in sheet with the name and signature of each contractor in attendance; and c. A copy of the curriculum and/or materials. 15.3.2 Technical Assistance for Contractors Contract managers and agency staff may provide technical assistance, as needed, throughout the term of the contract. Technical assistance may be provided by phone, email, or during on-site visits, and can include circumstances such as: a. Turnover in key agency or contractor staff; b. Difficulty with following contract terms and conditions, policies and procedures, or reporting requirements; c. Clarification of HHS agency policies ; d. Clarification of monitoring and oversight requirements; e. Billing or payment issues; or f. Other identified needs. 15.3.2.1 Mitigating Minor Contractor Issues Contract managers may determine that specific contractors would benefit from technical assistance in instances when the contractor: a. Has minor noncompliance issues that do not warrant formal actions ; b. Has technical problems or issues with billings; or c. Has difficulty in determining an approach to correct a problem or issue. 15.3.2.2 Documentation The contract manager must ensure technical assistance is adequately documented to include the following items and are uploaded into the SCOR Documents sub-module: a. The name of the contractor b. The contract number c. Date of technical assistance d. Summary of technical assistance provided e. Action items, if any 15.3.2.3 Audits Technical assistance should not be provided to a contractor when an open or ongoing audit is taking place. 15.4 Contract Oversight Contract managers must conduct contract oversight activities to verify the contractor is performing all contract obligations, so the HHS System Agency is aware of and able to address any developing issues. Contract oversight includes planned, ongoing, periodic, or unscheduled activities that measure and ensure compliance with the terms, conditions, acquisition, service delivery, and related requirements of a contract. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 141 The objective of contract oversight is to promote accountability and ensure the state gets what it pays for by: a. Determining compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, including applicable state and federal regulations; b. Providing feedback and technical assistance to prevent noncompliance ; c. Evaluating system and process controls to ensure reliable validation of service deliverables; and d. Assessing and evaluating progress towards successful completion of performance requirements and outcomes. 15.5 Oversight of Grant Performance Contract managers who manage grant agreements must ensure grantees are responsible for the oversight of the operations of the state award -supported activities. Grantees must monitor their activities under state awards to assure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and the specific award requirements and ensure performance expectations are being achieved. Grant agreements should be managed in accordance with UGG, TxGMS (or its successor), and the same contract management requirements and best practices in this Handbook, as applicable. As always, federal and state requirements take precedence if any conflict exist s between the Handbook and federal or state requirements. 15.5.1 Grantee Accountability The contract manager is responsible for grantee accountability in meeting grant requirements and must ensure that the grantee has policies in place to oversee and monitor their subcontractors. The grantee must: a. Maintain effective control over, and accountability for all grant funds, property, and other assets; b. Safeguard all assets and assure that they are used solely for authorized purposes; c. Evaluate and monitor compliance with statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the awards; d. Take prompt and appropriate action when instances of noncompliance are identified; and e. Take reasonable measures to safeguard protected personally identifiable information and other information designated as or considered sensitive. 15.5.2 Overseeing Grant Performance In overseeing grant performance, program staff and contract managers must ensure grantees achieve goals and complete deliverables. HHS agenci es oversee grant performance by conducting programmatic and fiscal monitoring. Contract managers must strive to ensure fiscal and program compliance by reviewing the results of fiscal and programmatic monitoring. Fiscal monitoring may include reviewing internal controls, indirect costs and expenditures for allowability, reconciling expenditures with service delivery, and monitoring the overall fiscal compliance of the grantee. Programmatic monitoring may include monitoring performance s and accomplishments against program objectives and compliance with reporting requirements. By closely monitoring performance throughout the grant period, potential problems can be addressed to keep grantees on course. Monitoring can be done through formal methods such as reporting, on-site reviews, and desk reviews. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 142 Grant management includes: a. Effectively monitoring grantees through the use of management systems and site visits to provide timely and accessible information on performance and deliverables. b. Identifying, prioritizing, and managing potential at-risk grantees. Higher risk grantees may require more frequent and intensive monitoring and technical assistance to ensure overall success. c. Sharing monitoring results with grantees to assist with improving performance. d. Reviewing reports for timeliness, quality, and accuracy on an ongoing basis, including data entered into reporting systems. e. Measuring effectiveness to determine if reported results are satisfactor y. f. Reviewing data to determine if funding is over or under what is awarded . 15.6 Contract Risk Assessment A Contract Risk Assessment is a systematic evaluation of how the characteristics of a contract (such as dollar value, direct services contracts, etc.) increase the risk of harm to people or of the state facing losses (financial or otherwise) if the contractor performs poorly, does not fulfill the terms of a contract, or engages in fraud, waste, or abuse. In HHS, the purpose of the Contract Risk Assessmen t is to help ensure that the allocation of time, staff, and resources towards contract oversight is commensurate with each contract's risk level. For example, high risk contracts should undergo greater oversight and more frequent monitoring than low risk c ontracts. Contract managers (or other individuals designated by program areas) are required to complete the SCOR Baseline Risk Assessment and may complete other types of Contract Risk Assessments as directed by program areas. 15.6.1 SCOR Baseline Risk Assessment HHS requires completion of the SCOR Baseline Risk Assessment for all contracts not listed in Section 16.6.3 (Exceptions). The SCOR Baseline Risk Assessment is comprised of risk factors that assess characteristics about the contract and the contractor. Each completed SCOR Baseline Risk Assessment results in a contract risk level of low, medium, or high. The SCOR Baseline Risk Assessment must be completed no later than (60) calendar days after the beginning effective date as stated in the terms of the contrac t (reflected in SCOR as Begin Date within the Contract Detail sub -module) and must be used to create a Contract Monitoring Plan in accordance with Section 15.7 (Contract Monitoring Plan). A new SCOR Baseline Risk Assessment is required within sixty (60) calendar days from the contract amendment date to (i) increase the Current Contract Value or (ii) extend the contract Period as defined in this handbook . The contract amendment date is listed in SCOR as \"Begin Date\" for the respective amendment within the Contract History sub -module. The purpose of the updated SCOR Baseline Risk Assessment is to evaluate changes that may increase the contract's risk level . If the contract's risk level increases upon completion of the updated SCOR Baseline Risk Assessment, the Contract Monitoring Plan must be updated to include contract oversight activities that are commensurate with the increased risk level. See Section 12 (Risk Assessments) in the SCOR Contract Manager Guide for instructions on how to complete the SCOR Baseline Risk Assessment. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 143 15.6.2 SCOR Baseline Risk Assessment Compliance Program areas must have a review process in place that is performed by supervisors or th eir designees to help ensure their staff complete the SCOR Baseline Risk Assessment accurately and timely and take action to address potential noncompliance issues before they occur. This process must include steps that supervisors (or their designees) wil l take to resolve noncompliance, prevent it from reoccurring (such as implementing additional supervisory oversight and/or requirements for staff), and retain documentation to demonstrate their compliance with the program area's review process. The quality review process must (i) be initiated and completed by the supervisor (or their designees) before the end of the last business day of each month and (ii) result in actions to address contracts whose SCOR Baseline Risk Assessments are not compliant or are a t risk of being noncompliant. Program areas' review process may permit supervisors to forgo performing a quality review during periods in which the supervisor knows their staff have no outstanding SCOR Baseline Risk Assessments to complete (e.g., the compl etion of SCOR Baseline Risk Assessments is not necessary due to no new contract actions having taken place during the review month). Note: The supervisor (or designee) should use the SCOR Risk - Initial Baseline Assessment Due report to determine which new contracts are not compliant or are at risk of being noncompliant. See the SCOR Standard Reports Guide for instructions on how to use the rep ort. In addition, the \"Begin Date\" for contract amendments listed in the SCOR Contract History sub -module should be used to determine which contract amendments are not compliant or are at risk of being noncompliant. PCS also serves as a line of defense to help ensure the timely completion of SCOR Baseline Risk Assessments by conducting compliance reviews, typically within the first week of each month. When PCS identifies noncompliance with SCOR Baseline Risk Assessment requirements, PCS notifies the appropriate contract manager and their supervisor and requests that the noncompliance be resolved within two (2) weeks. If the noncompliance is not resolved within the two (2) weeks, PCS notifies the PCS Deputy Executive Commissioner for escalation to the contract manager's respective leadership for resolution (such as the contract manager's agency chief or equivalent, deputy executive commissioner or equivalent, and/or top procurement official in their respective organizational structure). 15.6.3 SCOR Baseline Ri sk Assessment Exceptions Program areas are not required to complete the SCOR Baseline Risk Assessment for the following types of contracts: a. Transactional purchase orders (TPOs). b. Revenue generating contracts. c. MOUs or MOAs that have no monetary value. d. Administrative contracts with a Current Contract Value of less than $25,000 (as stated in SCOR). e. Texas SmartBuy purchase orders through the CPA term contracts and TXMAS contracts that have the following Purchase Category Codes (PCC): i. PCC A: Purchases from CPA SPD term contracts using the Texas SmartBuy online ordering system. ii. PCC C: Purchase from CPA SPD Managed term contracts by issuing internal purchase orders directly to the contractor. iii. PCC G: Non -Delegated procurements processed by CPA SPD through compe titive IFB or RFP on behalf of the requesting agency. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 144 iv. PCC X: Purchase of items from CPA TXMAS contracts through the Texas SmartBuy online ordering system. 15.6.4 Other Contract Risk Assessment \"Other Contract Risk Assessment\" means any assessment of a contract's risk (e.g., evaluation of one or a group of risk factors) that a program area chooses or is required to complete that is not the SCOR Baseline Risk Assessment. Examples of other types of risk assessment include but are not limited to a financial risk asses sment or a program -specific risk assessment. In general, other types of Contract Risk Assessment are tailored to programs or contract types and include more evaluation criteria than the SCOR Baseline Risk Assessment. However, these other types of Contract Risk Assessment cannot replace the SCOR Baseline Risk Assessment. If a program area chooses or is required to complete another type of Contract Risk Assessment, they must do so as prescribed by their policies and procedures. However, the other type of Cont ract Risk Assessment must: (i) result in a risk level of low, medium, or high; (ii) be used to inform the Contract Monitoring Plan in accordance with Section 15.7 (Contract Monitoring Plan); and (iii) be uploaded to SCOR. See the Section 12 (Risk Assessment) in the SCOR Contract Manager Gu ide for instructions on how to upload other types of Contract Risk Assessment to SCOR. 15.7 Contract Monitoring Plan Contract managers must refer to the SCOR Baseline Risk Assessment and, if applicable, the program -specific risk assessment instrument (PRAI) in order to prioritize monitoring activities and establish a contract monitoring plan. A contract monitoring plan establishes the monitoring schedule and activities required for individual contracts. It also tracks the status and progress of monitoring requirements. Each program is expected to develop a contract monitoring plan based on risk that defines which contracts will be monitored within what timeframe (volume and frequency). If new or greater risks are identified for a contract, it may be added to the contract monitoring plan. The contract monitoring plan must: a. Identify the contracts that will be monitored during an established timeframe; b. Identify monitoring activities based on the complexity, value, and risk of the contract ; and c. Track the status and progress of monitoring requirements. Contracts identified on a contract monitoring plan are to be monitored as per the plan. Contract monitoring plans, to include adjustments, are reviewed and approved in accordance with the program area's internal operations and made available upon request. A fiscal monitoring plan may also be developed by the fiscal monitoring unit of an HHS agency, division or program , as applicable, for certain subrecipient or recipient contractors based on level of risk. Once a contract monitoring plan has been developed, it should be entered into the SCOR Monitoring sub- module. The SCOR Monitoring sub-module allows contract managers to document contract monitoring activities. See the SCOR Contract Manager Guide for more information. 15.8 Contract Monitoring Contract monitoring is the systematic review of a contractor's records, business processes, deliverables, and activities to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the contrac t. The goals of contract monitoring are to: a. Protect the health and safety of those that receive services ; Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 145 b. Ensure delivery of quality goods and services ; c. Ensure contractor performance meets the contract terms ; and d. Protect the financial interest of the state. Each HHS agency that contracts for goods or services is responsible for actively monitoring all contracts by documenting contractor compliance with contract terms and conditions. In addition, agencies must ensure that effective monitoring policies and protocols are in place, including the development of a monitoring plan. 15.9 Contractor and Grantee Screening Post -Award Checks HHS agencies must demonstrate due diligence to ensure every contractor and grantee with whom HHS contracts is and remains eligible to do business with the State of Texas. Vendor check activities must be documented at the time they are performed, and records maintained in SCOR. Vendor checks are completed prior to contract award, renewal, extension , and in conjunction with contractor/grantee organizational changes. ( See Section 15.19.7 regarding Ownership or Name Change, for more information when the Texas Identification Number (TIN) changes.) Program areas may elect to establish policies to conduct checks at any other key c ontract activities, such as monitoring. Vendor checks are completed by accessing and searching various databases and verifying and documenting results. Procedural information is available on the Vendor Checks Job Aid. The Vendor Checks Job Aid, which includes a checklist, provides the necessary steps for staff to perform eac h vendor check. The Vendor Checks Job Aid was developed to aid divisions that procure and manage contracts in complying with general HHS vendor check and documentation requirements. However, the Vendor Checks Job Aid does not address program, solicitation, or contract specific vendor checks that may be required pursuant to applicable law or other governing source and programs must ensure all checks are properly and timely completed and documented. Divisions that manage contracts are strongly encouraged to u tilize the Vendor Checks Job Aid and checklist tools. If using a different method for vendor checks, the division must ensure their vendor checks align with the requirements (steps and applicability) outlined in the Vendor Checks Job Aid. Contract managers must maintain documentation in the contract file to support the outcome of the required checks if an issue is identified staff may refer to the Vendor Checks Job Aid and Section 16.20 regarding Escalation of Contract Issues to determine the appropriate ac tion. All documentation and applicable escalation communication must be uploaded in the SCOR Documents sub-module . See also, Section 14.12.1 regarding Vendor Checks, Section 14.12.2 regarding Additional Vendor Checks, Section 15.19.7 regarding Ownership or Name Change, and Section 15.21 regarding Escalation of Contract Issues . 15.10 Contract Monitoring Activities Contract monitoring activities can be conducted in a variety of ways, as long as they are objective; address contract complexity, value, and risk; and are documented the SCOR Monitoring sub-module. There are standard items each agency may review across all contracts. However, monitoring activities, questions, methods, and tools should also target specific elements or issues of concern unique to each contract. In determining what monitoring activities to conduct for a given contract, consider the following: a. Type of purchase b. Contract requirements c. Changes in the contractor's operations, personnel, or environment (e.g., shifts in population demographics or staff turnover) d. Individual risk factor scores on the PRAI. Consider focusing on risk factors scored the highest to identify weaknesses and help develop solutions for improvement Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 146 e. Prior monitoring history and past performance (e.g., problems recently resolved, recurring issues) f. Contractor strengths in areas tested and proven to be continuously compliant, in which case it may be appropriate to omit or reduce monitoring of those areas g. Recent reviews from or collaboration with other HHS agencies or contract divisions to coordinate monitoring efforts, reduce duplication, and promote consistency 15.10.1 Examples of Monitoring Activities 15.10.1.1 Billing Validation Billing validation could include a review of invoices, documents that support service delivery , and expenditure requests to determine if the rates and services are the same as allowed by the contract and to validate claims. Determine if the supporting documents , such as cost reports, third party receipts for expenses, etc., adequately support the request for payment. If the contractor consistently provides incorrect invoices , or the supporting document is insufficient to support the request, additional monitoring, such as an on-site visit, may be necessary. 15.10.1.2 On-Site Visit On-site visits are conducted at the contractor's location or service delivery site to review information and documents, personnel, physical facilities, live operations, service delivery, records, or other observable characteristics to objectively validate compliance with contract requirements. A site monitoring checklist is used to identify contract compliance requirements from which to assess the contractor's performance. To assess compliance, it may be necessary to review invoices, service delivery docume nts, personnel files, policies and procedures, internal controls, system reports and data, and audit files. Face-to-face interviews may be an effective method to use during site visits. 15.10.1.3 Desk Review A desk review is conducted at an HHS agency office to review information and documents to objectively validate compliance with contract requirements. Reviewing reports submitted by the contractor or other documents such as invoices, files, internal controls, system reports and data, audit files, financial records, personnel files, or phone interviews may be effective methods to use during desk reviews. 15.10.1.4 Third Party Monitoring Third Party Monitoring is conducted by an independent party to validate and verify compliance with contract requirements. This monitoring may be conducted as either a site visit, desk review or both. 15.10.1.5 Process Improvement Monitoring Process improvement monitoring is an approach using statistical data and pool sampling methodology (e.g. , six sigma) that measures overall quality to help determine likelihood of compliance and applies root cause analysis to negative findings to support corrective measures. This approach is also used to conduct targeted monitoring for specific requirements to ensure complianc e with quality standards. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 147 15.10.1.6 Team Approach The team approach is where monitoring is conducted by multiple individuals either simultaneously or at different times with different scopes. A team approach may be most appropriate for extremely complex or large contracts. It may include implementation of a contract management governance framework or committee, which includes formal structures to oversee contractors' obligations and objectives and ongoing communication to promote positive performance and adherence to the contract. All representatives of the review team should be in agreement regarding any issues and corrections, sanctions, or remedies. 15.10.1.7 Inspection and Testing Inspection occurs at the contractor's place of business to determine whether the goods or services comply with the contract under which they were purchased. Tests may be performed on samples. When products tested fail to meet all applicable specifications, the costs of the sample used, and any testing performed shall be borne by the contractor. 15.10.2 Monitoring Types The scope of monitoring may be categorized into particular types or may include elements of multiple types as shown in the following chart . TYPES OF MONITORING Monitoring Type Description Possible Actions Fiscal Monitoring A review of a contractor's financial operations, which may include review of internal controls for program funds in accordance with state and federal requirements, an examination of principles, laws and regulations, and a determination of whether costs are reasonable and necessary to achieve program objectives. (This activity involves assessment of financial statements, records, and procedures. It is similar to an audit, but with a lesser degree of detail and depth, and usually a higher degree of frequency.) Review the terms of their contracts, accounting systems, billings to the funding agency appropriately, and submitted reports for compliance with state and federal laws, rules and regulations; Report on the grantee's compliance with HHS contract terms and provisions in regard to fiscal requirements; Review, accept, and verify Cost Allocation Plans; Review, reconcile, and accept Grantees' Property Inventory Reports. Verify that goods and services billed were actually delivered according to contract requirements . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 148 TYPES OF MONITORING Programmatic Monitoring A review of a contractor's service delivery system to determine if it is consistent with contract requirements including outputs, outcomes, quality and effectiveness of programs. In programmatic monitoring, service - related information is reviewed for compliance with process and outcome expectations as identified in standards, rules and contracts. This activity assesses the degree to which the identified need is being met and the quality of the service being provided. Review the provisions of the contract to determine desired outputs and outcomes . Review materials to determine if goods or services are being provided appropriately . Interview agency personnel, contract staff, individuals receiving services, or others to determine if the services are being performed according to the contract . Administrative Monitoring A review of a contractor's internal controls and operating processes. Review personnel files and records Verify required training and licensure Verifying background check requirements Verify contractor insurance coverage Review compliance with subcontractor requirements Validate internal control processes, such as adherence to contractor's written policies/processes or application of information security protections Review of complaints and resolution Goods Activities to determine whether the delivered goods comply with the contract under which they were purchased Inspection of goods Testing using standard industry testing methods Verify the invoice is correct Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 149 15.10.3 Sampling Depending upon the monitoring scope and the risk, complexity, value, and volume of goods or services being performed under the contract, it may be appropriate to select a representative sample of contractor information and documentation when conducting monitoring. The process of sampling is designed to statistically determine a subset of individuals from within a given population to estimate characteristics of the whole population. When planning to monitor, sampling can be used to determine what size and selection of information (e.g., the number of files, records and expenditure items to be tested) accura tely represents the contractor's overall performance for the item being reviewed. Use of a standard sampling methodology helps eliminate the appearance of bias during the sampling selection. This methodology gives each item in the population an equal chance of being reviewed and allow for random selection of individual items. However, it may be necessary to utilize an alternative sampling methodology when there is a small population, or it is needed to evaluate risk for fraud, waste, and abuse. 15.10.4 Grantee Single Audit Requirement Grantees who spend $750,000 or more in federal awards or $750,000 or more in state awards during that entity's fiscal year must have a single audit performed by an independent, third -party auditor. A copy of the single audit report is submitted to the CQC Single Audit Unit (SAU) and uploaded into the SCOR Contractor module, Single Audit sub-module. As established in HHS Circular C-041, Grantee Contractors Guidelines to Re-procure Single Audit Services , grantees required to obtain a single audit must re-procure single audit services every six years. The contract manag er must verify the recipient or subrecipient is compliant with this requirement through the use of a tracking system or attestation of compliance from the contractor. A grantee not meeting the $750,000 threshold is not required to undergo a single audit but must provide financial statements to the SAU and abide by UGG on cost principles and administration . 15.10.5 Single Audit Desk Reviews The SAU will conduct a desk review of the single audit report. Findings included in the single audit report that impact HHS programs should be addressed by the HHS division within the requested timeframe and should ensure the grantee takes appropriate and timely action on all single audit findings. The SAU reviews the single audit report via a desk review and forwards the report to the PCS SCOR administrator for upload to the single audit sub-module in SCOR. a. If the single audit report does not contain any findings that impact HHS, SAU notifies the grantee in writing of the results of the desk review. b. If the single audit report contains findings that impact HHS: v. SAU forwards the Funding Agency Notification Letter and relevant information to the HHS program's point of contact and Fiscal Monitoring Unit(s) for review and approval of any corrective action plan included in the report. vi. HHS program management response should be provided to SAU within 15 business days from the date SAU provided the notification letter to program and will be uploaded into the single audit sub-module in SCOR. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 150 vii. SAU reviews the mana gement response provided by the program and notifies the grantee in writing of the results of the desk review and whether the corrective action plan included in the single audit report is accepted or is subject to further evaluation . 15.11 Assessing Internal Controls Internal controls are necessary to promote efficiency, reduce risk, and help ensure the reliability of financial information. A well-planned and operational internal control system provides reasonable assurance that an entity can achieve goals and objectives as set in the contract terms and conditions. 15.11.1 Effective Internal Controls Effective internal controls include the following components: a. Control environment: Sets the tone of an organization, and includes factors such as integrity, ethical values, management's philosophy, and operating style. b. Risk assessment: The identification and analysis of relevant risks to achieving objectives and determining how the risks should be managed. c. Control activities: The policies and proced ures that help ensure management directives are adhered to. d. Information and communication: Pertinent information must be identified, captured and communicated in a form and timeframe that enable employees to carry out responsibilities. e. Monitoring: Internal control systems must be monitored to assess the quality of the system's performance over time. 15.11.2 Generally Accepted Control Activities If a program area requires submission of a contracted agency's internal controls , contract managers may coordinate with other agency staff as needed to assess the adequacy of the agency's internal controls by using the five generally accepted control activities shown below with examples: 15.11.2.1 Segregation of Duties Different individuals are assigned responsibility for different elements of related activities. For example, the same individual should not receive cash, deposit the cash, record the receipt of the cash, and be responsible for purchasing goods and services and subsequently disbursi ng funds through the accounts payable system. 15.11.2.2 Proper Authorization Transactions and activities should include the proper authorization that will help ensure that all company activities adhere to established guide lines unless responsible managers authorize another course of action. For example, a fixed rate sheet may serve as an official authorization of price for staff. A properly stated control should be in place for authorized deviations from this rate sheet. 15.11.2.3 Adequate Documents and Records Controls designed to ensure adequate recordkeeping include the creation of invoices and other documents that are easy to use and sufficiently informative; use of pre-numbered, consecutive documents; and timely preparation . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 151 15.11.2.4 Physical Control Over Assets and Records Helps protect the organization 's assets. These control activities may include electronic or mechanical controls, such as employee ID cards, fences, a safe, cash registers, fireproof files, and locks. They may include computer -related controls dealing with access privileges or established backup and recovery procedures. When evaluating controls for the safeguarding of assets it is important to consider the various types of assets that tend to be more vulnerable, such as cash at hand or easily accessible in the form of cash deposits, checks, loans, accounts receivable, and marketable securities (bonds, notes, shares, stocks) that an organization owns. 15.11.2.5 Independent Checks Independent checks are carried out by employees who did not perform the work being checked. For example, a supervisor verifies the accuracy of an employee's petty cash drawer at the end of the day. 15.12 HSP Monitoring and Progress Assessment Report (PAR) The contract manager should be aware that the contractor is required to submit, if applicable, a completed PAR monthly as a condition of payment. The completed PAR is required to include the subcontracting payments the prime contractor paid to each subcontractor for the reporting (month) period the report covers. The PAR is required to monitor the prime contractor's HSP to ensure the contractor is utilizing only the subcontractors stated on the approved HSP, and that new subcontractors are not being utilized without prior approval from the HUB Coordinator and in compliance with the good faith effort requirements for subcontracting (Reference Section 14.10 regarding Coordination and Preparation of Contract Documents ). NOTE: Utilizing an unapproved subcontractor may be considered breach of contract. HSP auditing is required to verify the subcontracting payments reflected on the PAR form by comparing the information to the subcontractors' invoices submitted with the request for payment by the contractors. Should a discrepancy in the PAR be discovered during the contract, the program area, and the HUB Program will work together to address and correct any potential HSP noncompliance. Any documented HSP noncompliance must be factored into the VPTS Score. At contract close -out, a complete review of the HSP must be conducted to determine whether the prime contractor implemented the HSP contract provision in good faith. If the prime contractor -maintained compliance with the good faith effort subcontracts requirements, then it may be deemed the HSP was implemented in good faith. 15.13 Monitoring DUA Compliance HHS Circular C-049, HHS System Office of the Chief Data Officer, established the Office of Chief Data Officer (OCDO) for managing data and creating a governance structure for data created, managed , or maintained with the HHS System. A contract manager may include an assessment of compliance with DUA requirements when monitoring contracts that contain confi dential information Appendix F - DUA Confidential Information Protection , provides an assessment that may be used in conjunction with exist ing monitoring processes. 15.14 Monitoring of Staff Augmentation Contractors Monitoring of staff augmentation contractors includes documentation of their tasks and attendance as a form of verification that the agency is receiving value from the acquisition. Documentation may include the following : Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 152 a. A Contract Employee File may include resumes, results of selection process, job description, time sheets, progress reports, feedback, and evaluation notes . b. Status Report of tasks performed, or deliverables completed at scheduled intervals (monthly, bi-weekly, weekly) . c. Timesheet or time tracking system should include a reconciliation of any approved leave or modified schedule approvals . When monitoring results in issues or findings , contract managers must also follow -up with additional action to ensure findings are resolved. 15.15 Contract Monitoring Documentation and Follow -Up Activities During the course of a contract monitoring, contract managers must ensure documentation of monitoring activities and results is complete, factual, thorough, and substantiates findings, such as performance deficiencies or instances of noncompliance . Once the monitoring review is concluded, a monitoring report is developed. The final monitoring report identifies, documents and communicates to the contractor the facts, findings, and conclusions resulting from the review. The report should be clear and concise. In addition, confidential sample or employee identifying information must not appear in the report. Monitoring documentation should include: a. HHS agency and associated program or division; b. Name of person conducting monitoring; c. Date of monitoring activities; d. Fiscal year being reviewed; e. Type of monitoring activity (site visit or desk review); f. The sampling methodology used and the selected sample; g. Monitoring tools and working papers; h. Substantiated findings, and if any dispute, the resolution; i. Copies of supporting documentation to substantiate findings; and j. Actions taken, such as escalat ion, liquidated damages, corrective action plans, or service or payment hold Monitoring information is entered in the SCOR Monitoring sub-module and the completed monitoring tool, or as applicable, final report, is uploaded into the SCOR Documents sub-module unless prohibited from view by state or federal rules or regulations. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 153 EXAMPLES OF MONITORING FOLLOW -UP Nature of the Finding Possible Action Response Other Optional Steps Contractor misunderstanding of requirements Communication with contractor Technical assistance Follow -up monitoring to verify compliance Corrective action plan Contractor noncompliance with requirements (Non -systemic) Formal corrective actions Escalate to program management and PCS Require a Corrective Action Plan Impose contract remedies as specified in the contract Recurring contractor non- compliance issues High Risk Examples: Significant harm or risk of harm to individuals Significant misuse of agency funds or resources Concerns of fraud, waste, or abuse Contract Remedies to resolve the problem and/or eliminate negative impact Escalate to program management and PCS Implement enhance monitoring Reduce services or dollars associated with the contract Collection of improper payments/ disallowances Impose adverse actions: o Suspension of referrals or services ; o Suspension of payments ; o Assess liquidated damages or penalties ; or o Terminate prior to contract end date Report the contractor to VPTS , as applicable, for unsatisfactory performance, to the appropriate licensing organization, the IG, or law enforcement 15.16 Enhanced Contract and Performance Monitoring Agencies are required to utilize an enhanced monitoring method for high -dollar and high -risk contracts. Enhanced monitoring is an increased level of monitoring, beyond the regular monitoring . Increased monitoring may include, but is not limited to, the following : frequency of site visits, contractor meetings, and documentation requirements deemed necessary by the agency to assess progress of the contractor toward meeting identified goals and outcomes established in response to an assessment s of unsatisfactory performance. HHS agencies consider a high -dollar contract to be a contract with a value of $10 million or more, regardless of the contract begin date. Enhanced monitoring is also applicable to $0 contract agreements with expenditures that reach the $10 million threshold in actual expenditures. MOUs, MOAs, interagency contracts and interlocal agreements are exempt from enhanced monitoring requirements. HHS agencies may expand the scope of contracts that require enhanced monitoring beyond the $10 million threshold as defined above for their respective agency based on legislative, federal, and state requirements. For example, GAA, Article IX, Section 17.10 was amended by the 86th Legislature (2019) to allow HHS to request to exempt managed care contracts in the Medicaid and CHIP program from the requirement to seek competitive bids before extending or renewing a contract that has been in effect for more than five fiscal years as of August 31, 2019. The request must be submitted to the LBB, outline the justification for the exemption, and state that HHS agrees to enhanced oversight of the contract upon LBB approval of the exemption and LBB-determined level of enhanced oversight , unless waived. If the LBB determines the requirements have not been met, corrective actions may apply. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 154 When a contract has a value or expenditure reach of $10 million , the contract manager must review the contract to assess the prescribed monitoring protocol to include, as applicable, the schedule of deliverables, to determine if the specified protocol is sufficient to assess ongoing performance. In addition, the contract must include a provision for enhanced monitoring in response to an assessment of unsatisfactory performance. 15.16.1 Implement Enhanced Monitoring To implement enhanced monitoring, the contract manager must: a. Develop an enhanced monitoring plan (i.e., monitoring frequency, key requirements, noted areas that will be monitored and monitoring activities). Enhanced monitoring activities may include, but are not limited to: i. Training and technical assistance (provider meetings); ii. Submission of contractor reports of status or progress toward meeting identified goals and outcomes established in response to assessments of unsatisfactory performance; or iii. Additional HHS reviews of the contract (desk or onsite) with documented follow -up requirements for any significant findings. b. Notify the contractor in writing (letter or e-mail) that enhanced monitoring protocols have been activated for the remaining contract period unless this provision was contained within the contract terms and conditions. The notice should include: i. Reference to Texas Government Code Section 2261.253(c) ; ii. Contract number; and iii. Components of the enhanced monitoring plan. c. The contract manager is required to complete enhanced monitoring activities as per the enha nced monitoring plan and upload the enhanced monitoring plan and monitoring documents into the SCOR Contract module, Documents sub-module. 15.16.2 Enhanced Monitoring Reporting and Compliance Contract managers must report any serious issues or risks identified with respect to contracts requiring enhanced monitoring to their management who should report such identified issues and risks to HHS executive staff. 15.17 Financial Management of Contracts Financial management of contracts means the actions contract managers take to effectively monitor contract funding and oversee contract budgets, contract expenditures, and payments to contractors. The following are financial management responsibilities and HHS -specific policies by which contract managers mu st abide. 15.17.1 Budget and Expenditure Oversight PCS Policy 352 PCS Policy 354 Contract managers are responsible for monitoring the contract budget to ensure sufficient funds are available throughout the term of the contract. HHS contract managers must obtain approval of contract amounts from the HHSC Chief Financial Officer (CFO) budget department for the contracts they manage, or will manage, each fiscal year, in accordance with PCS Policy 352, Budget Roster Approval. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 155 In addition, HHS contract managers must track and document contract expenditures, and act if necessary, to ensure the contractor is providing goods and services as agreed upon and to prevent contract expenditures from exceeding the approved contr act value, in accordance with PCS Policy 354, Ependiture Tracking. 15.17.2 Invoice Processing PCS Policy 353 Contract managers are responsible for verifying accuracy of invoices and authorizing payments consistent with the contract terms. HHS contract managers must follow HHS requirements for receiving, approving, processing, and tracking payment of invoices, in accordance with PCS Policy 353, Invoice Processing. Please send any questions about Financial Management of Contracts and referenced policies to the PCS CMS team at PCS_CMSupport@hhsc.state.tx.us . 15.18 Review for Amendment, Renewal or Re-procurement Contract managers must regularly review assigned contracts to determine which contracts expire soon . The contract manager should consult with their management to determine whether the contract will be renewed, extended, re-procured, or allowed to expire. If no more renewals remain available under a contract, contract managers should consult with program staff to determine whether the services are still needed, and a new solicitation must be issued. The contract manager's assessment should consider all required internal and external timeframes necessary for successful renewal or re-procurement. 15.19 Contract Amendments , Bridge Extension s and Renewals A contract amendment is a formal, written change to an existing contract. A contract modification can be identified by the contractor, agency program staff, or the contract manager . Procurement and contract documents serve as the primary guide in establishing whether or not contract modification s can be allowed. The contract must contain provisions that allow changes to services, deliverables , or other aspects of the contract agreement. Additionally, the contract manager must ensure contract modifications comply with applicable law, HHS agency policy, and do not violate procurement requirements. All amendments must be executed prior to the expiration date of the contract. If a change is needed to a contract, the change has to be within the original scope, or parameters of the solicitation. A significant difference in the scope of work would be a material or substantial change and would not be allowed because it was not originally subject to fair competition. To permit such a change would go against the ideas of competition and a fair playing field for all of the vendors. If a contract amendment is substantial, a new solicitation is needed to ensure compliance with the competitive bidding statutes. A request to amend a contract is required if there is a change to the contract terms and conditions, such as: a. The service description or the statement of work (SOW) ; b. Performance measures; c. Dollar amount; d. Geographic service area; e. Contract period outside of the contract period stated in the contract; or f. An extension to the contract with in the contrac t period stated in the contra ct. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 156 15.19.1 Bridge Extension s PCS Operating Procedure 754 A Bridge Extension is an extension to an existing contract beyond the period of performance (including any renewals or optional extensions provided in the contract), to address immediate operational or service delivery needs caused by a delay in awarding a new contract. HHS must not use appropriated funds to pay for an extension to an existing contract beyond the base term and optional extensions provided for in that contract unless certain conditions are met. The duration and cost of the extension is limited to not more than one additional option period as defined in the contract to address immediate operational or service delivery needs. If the contract does not contain a defined option period, the extension is limited to one year.122 The HHS Executive Commissioner must approve the use of a bridge extension through the agency's action memo process. To ensure compliance with Article IX, Sections 7.11(d) and 17.09(e)(2), (3) of the GAA , HHS agency staff must follow the process provided in the procedure . 15.19.2 Major Information Resource Project (MIRP ) Contract Amendments Before amending a contract related to a MIRP , HHS must notify the governor, lieutenant governor, speaker of the house , presiding officers of the house and senate standing committees with primary jurisdiction over appropriations, and the QAT if the total value of the amended contract exceeds or will exceed the initial contract value by 10 percent , or if the amendment requires the contractor to provide consultative, technical expertise, or other assistance defining project scope or deliverables. Notice to the QAT must include justification for the amendment. (Reference Section 12.4.2 regarding Amending or Canceling MIRP Contracts ). 15.19.3 Contract Renewals PCS Operating Procedure 645 A contract with expenditures exceeding $5 million cannot be amended to exercise a renewal option until a vendor performance report has been completed and entered into the CPA's Vendor Performance Tracking System.123 (Reference Section 18.1 regarding Vendor Performance Reporting ). To amend a contract, the contract manager should consult the procedure to follow the process for renewing the two different types of contract renewals listed below : 15.19.3.1 Bilateral Amendment All parties to the contract agree to the new contract term and any negotiated modifications (if allowed), or other provision of the contract that needs to be altered. This means that the contractor must agree to the renewal period by signing a bilateral contract amendment ; and 15.19.3.2 Tracking Contract A tracking contract is entered to track allowable renewals in a procurement . To exercise a renewal for this type of contract requires a CAPPS requisition for the PCS Purchaser to execute a signed PCS Form 135, POCN Contract Amendment . 122 GAA , S.B. 1, 87th Leg., R.S., sec. 17.09(e). 123 Tex. Gov't Code \u00a72155.089(b -1) Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 157 15.19.4 Revenue -Generating Contract Amendments To amend a revenue -generating contract, the contract manager must update the record in SCOR. A new procurement is required if the proposed change is outside of the scope of the executed contract. Consult System Contracting as needed to determine if a change requires an amendment to the contract or a new procurement. 15.19.5 Certificate of Interested Parties (Form 1295 ) - Contract Amendments The information reported by a contracting entity on the Certificate of Interested Parties form submitted in support of an HHS contract may require revision during the term of the HHS contract. In addition, a 1295 may be required for certain contract amendments. The contract manager must ensure the vendor completes a new 1295 for the following situations : 15.19.5.1 Form 1295 Required When Not Previously Submitted If a contract that is not subject to Form 1295 submission requirements under Texas Government Code, Section 2252.908, is later amended, changed, or extended in such a manner that the contract, as amended, changed or extended, is subject to Form 1295 submission requirements under Texas Government Code, Section 2252.908, Form 1295 must be submitted. 15.19.5.2 New Form 1295 Required When Previously Submitted Additionally, a Form 1295 must be submitted if there is a change (including an amendment, change order, or extension of a contract) made to an existing contract if a Form 1295 was previously submitted and: a. There is a change to the disclosure of interested parties; or b. The changed contract requires an action or vote by the governing body of the entity or agency; or c. The value of the changed contract is at least $1 million greater than the value of the existing contract. If vendors are required to complete Form 1295 , Certificate of Interested Parties, it must be filed with the TEC and acknowledged by the contracting agency before the agency may sign the amendment. If a change to the disclosure of interested parties should occur or if an amendment or extension of a contract would require disclosure, the contractor must complete Form 1295 , Certificate of Interested Parties to reflect the updated information. The new Form 1295 is submitted to the HHS contract manager, who must acknowledge receipt of the form using the TEC online acknowledgement within 30 calendar days from HHS receipt of the filed 1295, and upload it into the SCOR Contract module, Document submodule. Reference Sectio n 14.13 regarding Disclosure of Interested Parties. 15.19.6 HUB Program Office Notification The contract manager must notify the HUB Program Office of proposed amendments when the aggregate contract amount approaches $100,000 or more , or when the contract with an existing HSP needs to be amended to comply with 34 TAC \u00a7 20.285 . When the original statement of work expands beyond the subcontracting opportunities desig nated by the CPA class and item codes in the original solicitation, the contractor may be required to submit a revised HUB Subcontracting Plan. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 158 If the HUB Program Office determines additional HUB subcontracting opportunities exist, the assigned HUB coordinator and contract manager will work with the contractor to assist them with developing and revising an adequate HSP. Once evaluated, the HUB Program Office will submit the conclusion to the contract manager , who will ensure its inclusion in the contract file. Additional HUB information can be found on the Historically Underutilized Business Opportunities Program Page ; and Section 14.10.1 .d regarding Coordination and Preparation of Contract Documents , and Section 15.12 regarding HUB Subcontracting Plan Monitoring and Progress Assessment Report . 15.19.7 Ownership or Name Change Contractors sometimes undergo ownership changes, name changes, or other changes. Sometimes, contractors seek to assign contracts or to assign payments under contracts. Most organizational changes will result in a new CPA Texas Identification Number (TIN). Examples of circumstances that result in a new TIN include sales and mergers. Name changes do not typically result in a new TIN. All changes must be permitted under the terms of the contract and reported by the contractor to the contract manager. Some contracts may permit certain actions but require advance notice or notice and approval. Each contract must be independently reviewed. All contract changes require a contract amendment. Contract managers must process vendor checks again if, for any reason, the contractor/grantee's TIN changes (whether it is a change in TIN made by the original contractor/grantee or a TIN change that results f rom some type of organizational change or other action (e.g., assignment). In the event of any change, the contract manager should review applicable provisions of the Comptroller's Guide, review the terms of the contract , and consult program management and, if necessary, System Contracting to determine the appropriate action. Reference Section 14.12.1 Vendor Checks , for additional information. 15.19.7.1 Name Change A contractor name change requires a letter from the original contractor on the original contractor's letterhead stating the circumstance of the name change, stating the original name and the new name, as well as the effective date of the change. An authorized representative of the contractor must sign and date the required letter. Upon receipt of the required letter, the contract manager may request a copy of the assumed name certificate filed with the Texas Secretary of State or a sales tax permit as proof of the name change. Name changes do not typically involve any change in the contractor's TIN. Because the Legal Entity name in SCOR comes directly from CAPPS through a daily file from the CPA, a request to HHS Accounts Payable needs to be made to update the Legal Entity name in CAPPS, which will then update SCOR. To request a name change in the CAPPS supplier name field: a. DSHS: The contract manager will notify the Contract Management Section of the name change. b. HHSC: The contract manager will complete CPA Form PCR 74-157, Payee Change Request and send it to HHSC Vendor AP at: vendorap@hhsc.state.tx.us . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , 15.19.7.2 Payee Change 74-157 Payee Change Request Form PCR 74-157 can be found on the HHS External Webpage. To use this link, an FMX User ID is required. When completing Form PCR 74-157, please note the following additional instructions for completing Section 3: a. Item 9: Enter the 11-digit Texas Identification Number (TIN) . b. Item 10: Do not enter the mail code (leave blank). This is only needed when it is a location change. c. Item 11: indicate the incorrect name that is appearing . d. Item 12: Enter the correct name you want Vendor Maintenance to change to. 15.19.7.3 New TIN If a new TIN, the contract manager must conduct all vendor checks under the new TIN, whether the contractor's name changes. If the new TIN is eligible to do business with the State of Texas, due to the connectivity between CAPPS and SCOR, the contract awarded to the previous TIN is amended to change the end date to coincide with the begin date of the contract established through CAPPS with the new TIN. CAPPS Financials will not allow a TIN change on an existing contract as this will break the connection between CAPPS and SCOR. 15.19.7.4 Assignment Texas Government Code Section 2262.056 prohibits vendors from assigning the vendor's rights under a services contract to a third party without approval by the HHS System Agency. In addition, a proposal to transfer by assignment contract responsibilities if the contract is an MIRP as defined under Texas Government Code \u00a72054.003, that exceeds $10 million for services or involves storing, receiving, processing, transmitting, disposing of, or accessing sensitive personal information in a foreign country requires approval by the HHS Executive Commissioner or other similar agency administrator or designee. Assignment of such a contract is not valid and no appropriated funds can be used for contract payments, unless notice of the assignment has been provided to the LBB and QAT at least 14 days prior to the date of approval, including a contract signed by the assignor or proposed assignee but not signed by HHS. 15.20 Contractor Performance Issues and Contract Remedies The contract manager should communicate with the program area routinely and maintain a reasonable level of awareness of a contractor's performance throughout the duration of the contract. Regulatory and contract management activities should be used as appropriate to alert a cont ract manager to noncompliance issues. The contract manager is responsible for investigating and addressing unacceptable contractor performance as quickly as possible. Contract managers and program staff should be familiar with remedy provisions in the contract and should consult PCS CMS and System Contracting as needed to determine the correct response to a contractor's performance issues. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 160 15.21 Escalation of Contract Issues HHS agencies must develop an escalation process to communicate contract related issues to agency executive management, program leadership, System Contracting , and PCS as appropriate and depending on the severity of the issue. Examples of issues for escalation include: a. Loss or misuse of agency funds; b. Risk the contract will exceed budget limitations or timeframes; c. Harm or risk of serious harm to individuals; d. Repeated noncompliance ; e. Publicized or political concerns; f. Patterns of complaints or high -profile complaint; g. Appearance of impropriety or potential conflict of interest; h. Suspicion of fraud, waste, or abuse ; and i. Vendor/Contractor/Grantee check results that identify issues. Contract managers must ensure agency executive management, program leadership, System Contracting , and PCS and other applicable staff are notified immediately when they become aware of contract issues or risks. Although contractor noncompliance issues are often identified during routine contract management activities or monitoring, contract managers must maintain an awareness of a contractor's performance throughout the duration of the contract. Effective escalation helps ensure problems and issues are addressed quickly to prevent harm to individuals, gaps in goods or service coverage, or misuse or waste of taxpayer dollars. In cases where an HHS agency has a committee or other entity that is responsible for sanctioning contractors for nonperformance, the agency's escalation process takes precedence over committee timeframes and procedures. See also, Section 14.12.1 regarding Vendor Checks, Section 14.12.2 regarding Additional Vendor Checks, Section 15.9 regarding Contractor and Grantee Screening Post -Award Checks, and Section 15.19.7 regarding Ownership or Name Change. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 161 16. CONTRACT EXPIRATION, TERMINATION, CLOSEOUT, AND SETTLEMENT 16.1 Contract Expiration A contract expires pursuant to its term and both parties are relieved of any further performance obligations, except as provided for in the contract. The expiration includes contracts that have available renewal options that the agency does not exercise. Written notification is not required for expiration; however, closeout procedures must be followed . 16.2 Contract Termination Contract expiration or termination is an end to the contract between the HHS agency and the contractor. Termination occurs when: a. The contract expires pursuant to its terms; b. Both parties agree to terminate the contract; or c. Either party terminates the contract. Each HHS agency must develop and document procedures for processing contract terminations. The procedures must outline the process based on the type and value of the contract. 16.2.1 Termination Decision The contract manager must review the contract terms and conditions, agency policy, and applicable laws and regulations to ensure termination is allowed and to determine the basis for termination. The contract manager must consult with the HHS agency's management and System Contracting regardi ng an HHS determination to terminate. Executive approval for the termination must be obtained before taking any action to process an amendment or notification to the contractor. Improper termination may subject the HHS agency to damages and other legal liabilities. Termination must be coordinated with agency program staff at the earliest possible stage so alternate arrangements can be made for goods or services and to ensure a smooth transition before the contract termination date. 16.2.2 Written Notice of Termination A written notice of termination must be sent to a contractor prior to the contract termination date. When practical, the HHS agency should give the contractor at least a 30-calendar day notice prior to the expiration date of the contract for a termination for convenience . In any case, HHS must comply with contractual provisions regarding required notice. The HHS agency representative with authority to sign the contract may delegate in writing the signature of the termination notice to a member of the program area's management team. The contract manager should send notices of terminations for convenience or cause by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by courier with a signature receipt request \u2014 or as otherwise provided in the contract . The contract manager or designee must upload the notice and verification of receipt of the termination notice in the SCOR Documents sub-module. A notice for termination by mutual agreement may be sent by email or fax, as applicable \u2014 or as otherwise provided in the contract . Again, HHS must comply with contractual notice provisions. So, if there is a provision in the contract regarding method of notice, it must be followed. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 162 16.2.3 Types of Contract Terminations 16.2.3.1 Termination \u2014 Mutual Agreement The HHS agency and the contractor may mutually agree to terminate the contract, prior to the expiration date, relieving the parties of any further performance obligations, except as provided for in the contract. The parties must document the mutual agreement to terminate by exchange of a formal written correspondence or as a contract amendment. If the contractor wishes to terminate the relationship, the contract manager must require written request to terminate from the contractor. 16.2.3.2 Termination \u2014 For Convenience The Uniform Terms and Conditions include the clause for termination for convenience , which allows for termination when it is in the best interests of the State of Texas. This termination is also referenced to and considered \"without cause\" and is effective on the date specified in the HHS agency's notice of termination. This termination is not an automatic right and must be specifically provided for in the contract. 16.2.3.3 Termination for Non -Appropriations \u2014 Excess Obligations Prohibited The Uniform Terms and Conditions refer to this type of termination as \"Excess Obligations Prohibited .\" This termination provision is subject to availability of state funds and occurs without penalty to the HHS agency , either in whole or in part. This termination may occur if the HHS agency becomes subject to a legislative change, revocation of statutory authority, or lack of appropriated funds that would render either the HHS agency's or contractor's delivery or performance impossible or unnecessary. The HHS agency will not be liable to the contractor for any damages that are caused or associated with the termination , and the HHS agency is not required to give prior notice. 16.2.3.4 Termination for Cause Termination for cause, except as otherwise provided by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or any successor law, the HHS agency may terminate a contract, in whole or in part, upon material breach of the contract by the contractor . The HHS agency will have the right to terminate the contract in whole or in part if the agency determines, in its sole discretion, that the contractor has failed to perform or make progress, or in any way has materially breached the contract or has failed to adhere to any laws, ordinances, rules, regulations or orders of any public authority having jurisdiction and such violation prevents or substantially impairs performance of the contractor's duties under the contract. This type of termination requires a legitimate basis and involves a contract breach , such as: a. Contractor's misrepresentation in any aspect of Contractor's Solicitation Response, if any; b. Failure to deliver goods or services within the time specified in the contract; c. Failure to perform any significant provision of the contract; d. Failure of progress, which could jeopardize the carrying out of the contract; e. Failure to comply with HHS agency rules, policies or procedures; f. Submission of falsified documents, fraudulent billings, or making false statements; g. Failure to obtain or maintain required licensure or certification; h. Inappropriate use or mismanagement of state or federal funds; Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 163 i. Performance that results in threats to individual health or safety; j. Continued instances of unacceptable performance; and k. Contractor's inclusion on the System for Award Management (SAM) as a debarred entity will also constitute a material breach. 16.2.4 Notice of Termination for Convenience , Mutual Agreement , or Non -Appropriation The notice must contain the following, at a minimum : a. The effective date of the termination; b. The reason for the termination; c. Contract citation that allows the termination; d. Record retention requirements; and e. A description of the closeout procedure. 16.2.5 Notice of Termination for Cause The notice must be approved by the HHS agency's management and System Contracting and must contain the following at a minimum: a. The effective date of the termination; b. A statement of all contract provisions that the contractor failed to meet; c. Any related materials demonstrating contractor failures; d. Contract citations that allow the termination; e. Notice of the contractor's rights of recourse, if any; f. Record retention requirements; and g. A description of the closeout procedure. 16.3 Contract Closeout The contract manager should initiate closeout activities when there is a reasonable certainty that the terms and conditions of the cont ract have been met and the contract will not be renewed or extended. Unless otherwise stated in the contract, the closeout process must be completed and entered in the SCOR Close -Out sub-module within 90 days of the contract end date, unless extenuating circumstances exist. If contract closeout is delayed for extenuating circumstances, the contract manager should enter a brief explanation of the delay into the comment field in the SCOR Close -Out sub-module. If a contract is closed out in error, contact the SCOR Administrator at PCS_SCOR@hhsc.state.tx.us to change the status in SCOR. 16.3.1 End of the Contract Lifecycle Contract closeout is the final step and detailed process of the contract lifecycle. The complexity of each closeout can depend on factors such as: a. Whether the contract is a TPO; b. Whether the contract is competitively or noncompetitively procured; c. Whether it is a grant agreement with a contractor or subrecipient; d. Whether it is administrative, goods, or client services; and e. The status of the contract deliverables at the time of contract termination. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 164 16.3.2 Contract Closeout Process PCS Policy 358 The contract closeout process may include, as applicable to the contract: a. Completion of all administrative actions; b. Assignment of a status to each contract deliverable in in a tracking system or tool, in accordance with PCS Policy 358, Contract Deliverables Tracking ; c. Settlement of contract disputes, claims, and agreements; d. Protection of any HHS and HHS agency confidential information; e. Settlement of financial claims; f. Audit of any records or payments; g. Cancellation of any goods or services not yet received; h. Transferring of caseloads and files; i. Transferring of equipment, hardware, software and goods; j. Transferring access to any information or reporting systems; k. Disposition of equipment; l. Review of HSP and submitted PAR forms in coordination with HUB Program in accordance with Section 15.12 regarding HSP Monitoring and Progress Assessment Report (PAR) ; and m. Vendor performance (VPTS reporting). 16.4 Grant Closeout Contract managers will close out the grant award when it determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required work of the grant have been completed by the grantee. In addition to the activities identified above in Section 17.3 regarding Contract Closeout, a recipient or subrecipient grantee must submit all financial, performance, and other reports as required by the terms and conditions of the grant award. Unless otherwise directed by terms, conditions, or additional provisions, all reports should be submitted by the grantee not later than forty -five (45) calendar days following the end of the grant term. Reimbursement or payment requests received after deadlines may not be paid at the discretion of the agency. Final reports and invoicing requirements are subject to grant record retention and access requirements . 16.5 Contract Settlement When a contract is terminated, the contract manager assesses any remaining financial transactions, including any overpayments, underpayments, or unprocessed payments. 16.5.1 Contract Manager Responsibilities The cont ract manager must: a. Negotiate a fair and prompt settlement that accurately reconciles and finalizes the work and any payments in accordance with applicable law; b. Protect the interests of individ uals served by an HHS agency and the HHS System; c. Verify completion of contract terms, including performance measurements; d. Identify and document any performance issues or deficiencies, and take appropriate corrective actions; Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 165 e. Consult with HHS agency management; and f. Consult and obtain approval from System Contracting on reaching the settlements. 16.5.2 Settlement Procedures Each HHS agency must have documented settlement procedures that include required documentation and approval , taking into account the type , complexity and value of the agency's contracts. These procedures must include, at a minimum: a. Determining approval authority for the settlement agreement; b. Required routing of the settlement agreement within the HHS agency for approvals; c. Obtaining cont ractor and HHS agency signatures on the settlement agreement; and d. Reviewing the contractor's compliance with the settlement agreement. 16.5.3 Reimbursement of Allowable Expenses When applicable, the contractor must be reimbursed for all allowable expenses incurred or services provided under the contract up to the termination date. However, an HHS agency is only obligated to pay for goods and services that meet applicable contract standards. Under termination for cause, an HHS agency may not be liable for the contractor's costs on undelivered work and is entitled to repayment of any advance or progress payments. 16.5.4 Contractor Obligations The contractor is responsible for the prompt resolution of any claims for its subcontractors and vendors. A subcontractor may have no contractual rights against the HHS agency on termination. Each claim must be documented by the contractor or the contract manager . The contractor may submit bills, records, affidavits, audit reports, and other documents to support contract invoices within a reasonable period of time, up to 90 days after termination. Contract managers should inspect a subcontractor's records if needed for the contract closeout. 16.6 Provide Contractor with Settlement The contract manager sends the final settlement agreement to the contractor by certified mail with return receipt requested or by courier with a signature reception request. The letter must explain that the determination is the HHS agency's final decision and must adequately explain each major item. In addition, if the decision constitutes a contract remedy, the letter must meet the requirements of a notice of contract remedy as stated in the contract. If the negotiated or determined settlement offer indicates the contractor owes payment, the contract manager sends a letter to the contractor requiring payment. The contractor must respond to the settlement within 30 days of receiving the HHS agency's letter, subject to the limits on filing an appeal if applicable. The contractor's options for responding to the settlement offer include paying in lump sum, paying in installments, or requesting an appeal. If the contractor does not respond within the required timeframe, the HHS agency may begin involuntary collection procedures. Contractor notices are uploaded into the SCOR Documents sub-module. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 166 17. CONTRACT RECORDS Maintaining and documenting contract management activities is critical to effectively managing contracts, making informed decisions, settling claims or disputes, and accurately accounting for and reporting contract data. 17.1 System of Contract Operation and Reporting (SCOR) SCOR HHS contracts and agreement (including agreements such as MOUs and MOAs) must be uploaded into the SCOR Contract History submodule. Supporting documents are uploaded to the SCOR Contract Documents submodule. HHS staff must not upload documents with protected health information, such as copies of social security cards, copies of voided checks, etc. Staff should consult with the Chief Privacy Officer as needed to determine if contra ct documents require protection . If a contract document has been determined to require protection, prohibiting the document from being viewed, staff must request assistance from the SCOR Administrator through the SCOR Mailbox at PCS_SCOR@hhsc.state.tx.us . The request must include approval to protect the document. The SCOR Administrator will assign and manage passw ord protection for the document. Contract managers must ensure the contract information in SCOR is updated throughout the contract lifecycle and is accurate and complete. If corrections to information in SCOR are required, contract staff either make the necessary correction or submit a request to the SCOR Mailbox. Supplemental contract records, including automated systems, electronic files, and paper records, may also be maintained to complete the contract record. Examples of documents uploaded to SCOR include: a. Solicitation ; b. Executed contract ; c. Contract amendments ; d. Contract correspondence ; e. Disclosures and conflict of interest forms ; f. Risk assessments ; g. Deliverables ; h. Monitoring documents ; i. Performance outcomes and reports ; j. Single audits ; k. HUB subcontracting plan and progress assessment reports ; l. Data Use Agreement (DUA) and Security and Privacy Inquiry (SPI) forms ; m. Closeout documentation ; n. VPTS reports (PCS Form 147); and o. Legislative , statutory, or federal required documentation (i.e., Disclosure of Interested Parties, Attestations, federal Assurances and Certification Regarding Lobbying, etc.) . 17.2 Contract File Checklists PCS Policy 355 Effective September 1, 2019, Section 2262.053 of the Texas Government Code requires agencies to maintain contract file checklists that address each stage of the procurement and contracting lifecycle. As a result, the PCS Contract Management Support (CMS) unit created checklists and associated procedures that incorporate Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 167 requirements outlined in the Comptroller's Guide. This policy applies to any contract solicitation or management activity initiated or required on or after September 1, 2020. Purchasers and the SCOR -designated contract manager will complete and upload into SCOR the appropriate checklist for each phase of the procurement and contracting lifecycle. PCS Procurement will complete checklists for the procurement and award phases of contracts in which Procurement is involved. For contracts established without PCS procurement involvement, the contract manager is responsible for completing, certifying, and uploading into SCOR the PCS Form 150-N to document the solicitation phase. The contract manager is responsible for completing, certifying, and uploading a PCS Form 170-F and/or PCS Form 170-M into SCOR to document completeness of the contract file at the appropriate contract phase or at certain contract events (i.e., amendments, monitoring, closeout). Contracting divisions and supervisors are responsible for ensuring the contract files are complete, certified, and uploaded by the SCOR -designated contract manager per established requirements. 17.3 Disclosure or Audit of Contract Records All contract records and documents are subject to examination and audit by the CPA, SAO , HHS Internal Audit, the Inspector General, and other state and federal auditors. Additionally, most government contract documents are public and must be released upon request , unless disclosure is expressly prohibited or confidential under law. All requests for public information must be handled in a timely fashion, and specific, formal protocols apply to requests made under the Public Information Act, Texas Government Code Chapter 552. Other than routine communication with staff, external stakeholders, or members of the public, only HHS Open Records Division staff in the Office of Chief Counsel are permitted to respond to public information or other external requests for information. If staff receive an information request, refer the requester to Openrecordsrequest@hhsc.state.tx.us . The HHS Open Records Division will coordinate the development of the response and release the response to the requester . 17.4 Records Retention In accordance with Section 441.1855 of the Texas Government Code , all contracts and related documents , including solicitation documents, must be retained for a minimum of seven years after a contract is complete (expired, terminated, or otherwise closed) , or all issues that arise from any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit, open records request, administrative review, or other action involving the contract or documents are resolved , whichever is later. A contract solicitation document that is an electronic document must be retained in the document's electronic form. A state agency may print and retain the document in paper form only if the agency provides for the preservation, examination, and use of the electronic form of the document, including any formatting or formulas that are part of the electronic format of the document. Pursuant to Section 441.1855 of the Texas Government Code , \"contract solicitation document\" includes any document, whether in paper form or electronic form that is used by a state agency to evaluate responses to a competitive solicitation for a contract issued by the agency. HHS also requires contractors to adhere to the same retention provision. Consult with HHS agency records retention personnel for detailed retention requirements. 17.5 Absent Contract Records Requirements 17.5.1 Absent Records Definition For purposes of this section , \"abse nt records\" refers to a contractor's records that are: a. Lost; b. Destroyed by fire, natural disaster or other cause; Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 168 c. Damaged beyond access or use; or d. No longer in the contractor's possession for any other reason (e.g. , stolen) before the retention period has been met. 17.5.2 Absent Record Impact to the Contract Monitoring Plan The contract manager is responsible to assess the impact of absent records on the scheduled monitoring of the contractor's performance. The contract manager will determine the need for revisions to the contract monitoring plan. The original contract monitoring plan should proceed if no revisions are necessary. Necessary revisions to the contract monitoring plan require approval of the Deputy Associate Commissioner. Whether or not the monitoring plan is revised, the contract manager must fulfill the duties outlined below. 17.5.3 Contract Manager Duties upon Notification or Discovery of Absent Records If a contract manager is notified of, or otherwise discovers, absent records, the contract manager must take the following actions: a. Obtain the following information from the contractor regarding the absent records and the circumstances giving rise to the absence: i. A summary of the circumstances causing the absence of the records; ii. If deeme d necessary or reasonable under the circumstances, copies of relevant photographs or other documentation; iii. A listing (as specific as possible) of the absent records to include a description of the contents and the time period covered by the records; iv. A copy of all correspondence, including claims filed with the contractor's insurance company, if applicable; and v. Certification that the reported information is true, complete, and correct. The certification may be in any written form, including an email. The certification is not required to be notarized but should be completed by an individual with authority to provide the certification on behalf of the contractor. b. Confirm the contractor followed all records safeguarding, storage, and reporting requirements as set forth in the contract. To determine whether there is contractual storage or reporting requirements, the contract manager should review the contract and submit questions to System Contracting regarding contractual requirements that remain after contract review. If the contract manager determines the contractor has not complied with the requirements, they must consult with program management and PCS to determine if additional action will be taken (e.g. , notification to Privacy Office, adverse action review due to breach). c. Send the contractor written correspondence (letter or email) instructing the contractor to provide written notification within 48 hours to both the contract manager and the HHS Privacy Office of either of the following events: i. Discovery by the contractor that records previously reported as destroyed were not destroyed, but lost, stolen, or otherwise absent in such a form that the records may still exist; or ii. The contractor has obtained copies of the absent records. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 169 d. Upload all submitted documentation and correspondence to the SCOR Contract module, Documents sub-module , and notify the HHS Privacy Office that the information has been uploaded into SCOR. e. Provide a copy of the incident summary and listing of absent records to the HHS Records Management Office via email at records@hhsc.state.tx.us .The HHS Records Management Office will determine if any additional reporting to the Texas State Library and Archives Commission is required and will complete such reporting if necessary. 17.5.4 Contract Manager Duties upon Notification Records are No Longer Absent If a contract manager receives notification from the contractor that the contractor has either determined that records previously thought to be absent may still exist (e.g. , contractor initially thought records were destroyed, but later learned they were stolen) or that copies of the records have been located, the contract manager must: a. Consult with program management to determine what additional action, if any, will be taken including, but not limited to, whether a new monitoring event should be scheduled; and b. Confirm with the HHS Privacy Office that the contractor notified the HHS Privacy Office of the event. Questions regarding privacy, confidential information, or related issues should be directed to the HHS Privacy Office at Privacy@hhsc.state.tx.us . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 170 18. REQUIRED REPORTING 18.1 Vendor Performance Reporting Per section 20.115 of the Texas Administrative Code, when a state agency assigns a grade lower than a \"C\" and submits a vendor report to the Vendor Performance Tracking system, the comptroller provides a copy of the report to the vendor and allows them 30 days to respond. If the vendor responds within 30 days, the comptroller's office may review relevant information and may change the vendor's performance grade as they deem necessary to insure as accurate and responsible contract reporting as possible. Except for a grade that was revised in the vendor's favor under subsection (c) of TAC 20.115, the executive head of a state agency may, within 48 months of submission of a vendor performance report and grade, request to revise the report and grade for a particular purchase order or contract by submitting a written justification for the grade revision to the comptroller. For more information, see www.cpa.texas.gov . 18.1.1 Vendor Performance Tracking System (VPTS) Section 2262.055 of the Texas Government Code requires the CPA to track and evaluate vendor performance based on information reported by state agencies. State agencies must consider vendor performance information and ratings contained in the VPTS when determining whether to award a contract to a particular contractor. (Reference Section 14.12 regarding Required Screening for Potential Contractors ). HHS System Agencies are required to accurately report contractor performance to the VPTS to allow state agencies to share vendor information and facilitate better oversight of contracts. Pursuant to Section 2155.089 of the Texas Government Code , vendor performance reporting is required for all contracts , including TPOs (except for contracts listed in Section 18.1.2 regarding Exemptions from VPTS Reporting ): a. Within 90 calendar days from the completion of all contractual activities or within 30 calendar days from the TPO end date if the total contract value is $25,000 or more; b. At least once per year during the term of the contract and at each key milestone in the contract if the contract value is $5 million dollars or more ; and c. Before amending a contract to execute a renewal period if the contract value exceeds $5 million dollars. Vendor performance reporting is also required for all other nonexempt contracts and open enrollment contracts when there are significant performance issues during the term of the contract that were not resolved and resulted in termination of the contract prior to the end date stated in the contract. 18.1.2 Exemptions from VPTS Reporting a. Open enrollment contracts (exemption applies to reporting at close -out only) b. Intrasystem contracts c. Interagency contracts d. Interlocal agreements e. Interstate contracts f. MOUs g. MOAs Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 171 h. Sub-contracts issued by a company with which the state has a contract i. Grant s In assessing vendor performance, the contract manager should consider whether the contractor met the requirements in the contract and, if applicable, consult with other staff involved in the contract. This information is used to grade (A-F) the contractor's performance. 18.1.3 Vendor Performance Report Requirements Vendor performance reports must: a. Be documented on PCS Form 147; b. Be based on solid, well-documented contract management and monitoring activities; c. Include supporting documents for reports of negative vendor performance (Grade of D or F); d. Be reviewed and approved by the supervisor of the HHS staff completing PCS Form 147; and e. Be submitted with any necessary documentation to the VPTS Mailbox at PCS_VPTS@hhsc.state.tx.us . PCS is responsible for reviewing and submitting vendor performance information to the CPA VPTS on behalf of the HHS System. After the vendor performance report has been accepted by the CPA and published into the VPTS, the vendor performance report (PCS Form 147) is uploaded by PCS into the SCOR Contractor module. For more information about vendor performance reporting , see CPA VPTS web page . 18.2 Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA) Reporting FFATA requires federal grant prime recipients such as HHSC or DSHS to report subrecipient124 award obligations and subrecipients' executive compensations in order to be publicly searchable via a single website at www.USASpen ding.gov. In brief, FFATA requires the following: a. Subrecipient awards of $30,000 or more must be reported. b. Prime awardees must report certain information regarding those funds. c. If certain criteria apply, the compensation of the top five executives within a subrecipient's organization must also be reported. d. Grant information reported for American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) grants is not required to be reported in FFATA. 19.2.1 HHSC Subrecipient Reporting Effective October 1, 2021, the HHSC Federal Funds Office (FFO) issued a policy outlining a new process for HHSC Program areas to report their subrecipient award obligations and subrecipients' executive compensations. FFO will co llect and report the data to FFATA Subaward Reporting System (www.FSRS.gov ). Program areas must ensure the following: 124 Recipients of state grant awards from HHSC or DSHS are not applicable to FFATA reporting. Additionally, a subrecipient award funded with both federal and state funds is only reported if the federal portion exceeds $30,000 and then only the federal portion is reports. Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 172 a. All subrecipients must have an assigned DUNS number. Instructions for obtaining a DUNS number are currently outlined in the PCS Form 804-A. As a note, by April 2022, the federal government will stop using DUNS numbers to uniquely identify enti ties registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). Subrecipients will be required to go to www.SAM.gov to be assigned a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) number to be used to identify organizations doing business with the federal government . b. All subrecipients must complete the HHSC FFATA Certification Form ( Form 8040 Attachment B ) at least once per state fiscal year. Program areas will submit completed forms to HHSCFFATA@hhs.texas.gov . If a subrecipient meets the following criteria, the subrecipient's top five highest paid executives' compensation amounts must be reported using FFO's FFATA Reporting Template. i. The subrecipient received 80 percent or more of their annual gross revenue from federal procurement contracts, ii. The subrecipient's annual gross revenue was or exceeded $25 million, and iii. The subrecipient's compensation information is not publicly available. c. Program areas must submit the FFATA Reporting Template to the FFO team at HHSCFFATA@hhs.texas.gov for all applicable subrecipients by the 15th of every month. d. Program areas must designate a single person to be the primary FFATA point of contact to submit reporting templates to FFO and respond to FFO's communication. Questions regarding FFATA requirements or reporting are to be sent to the HHSC FFATA Administrator at HHSCFFATA@hhs.texas.gov . 19.2.2 DSHS Subrecipient Reporting Contract managers are required to enter information for all contracts to the applicable SharePoint site including legal name, contract number, execution date, type of agreement, relationship determination (contractor, recipient, subrecipient), and CAPPS Fin ancials requisition number for solicitation initiation. Questions regarding DSHS FFATA requirements or reporting are to be sent to DSHS CMS at tina.walker@dshs.texas.gov . 18.3 WorkQuest Exception Reporting \u2014 Monthly Report on Set Aside Exceptions If an HHS agency determines that a product/service offered by WorkQuest needs to be purchased from another source, an exception justification must be included in the file. Texas Human Resources Code Section 122.016 requires PCS to file a WorkQuest exception report to CPA. The report is due the fifteenth (15) working day of each month. The Texas Human Resources Code Section 122.016( b) requires the CPA to provide a monthly report to the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) listing all items/services purchased as exceptions to Texas Human Resources Code Section 122.016 (a) and Texas Government Code Section 2155.138(a). In order for CPA to provide this information to TWC, each state agency must provide to CPA all delegated purchases made as exceptions to the set-aside contracts . Procurement and Contract Management Handbook , v. 1.1 173 18.4 Reporting HHS Contracts125 There are many reports and notifications related to state contracting that are required by the Legislature, LBB, CPA administrative rules, and statutory requirements .
