Feeling lost, stuck, or overwhelmed by your health challenges? Tell me your whole story, and together we'll figure it out and turn it around. Does it feel like your health doesn't belong to you? - symptoms out of control - medicine you don't understand or feel good about - maintaining it takes far too much willpower I'd like to help you: - look better and feel better without strain, - confidently choose between prescriptions, natural therapies, or a combination, - feel like your body is working like it's supposed to. Owning your health doesn't mean that you're alone. It means you're in charge to choose the partners and supports that are right for you. Here's the plan I suggest to see if you'd like working together: - STEP ONE: [Download the Intake Form](RNC_Patient_Intake_Form.pdf)to get a sense of how in-depth your initial appointment will be. - STEP TWO: [Check out my About Page](about_raleigh_naturopathic_clinic.php)video and vet my credentials. - STEP THREE: [Click Here to Schedule an Appointment](https://bit.ly/13jSBOb) The new patient appointment is 60 minutes, I want time to listen to your whole story and have you leave with a treatment plan that you feel good about. Want to work together but you're not ready yet? Don't leave before you get on my insider email list: If you find the content useful, and above all if you laugh at my jokes, then you're in the right place. "}
