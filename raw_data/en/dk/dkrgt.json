The goal of integrative cancer support services is to reduce the physical and emotional burdens of illness through pain and symptom management, supportive counseling and the integration of complementary therapies, such as acupuncture or mind-body therapies. Acupuncture Bring the body back into balance. Acupuncture is proven to be a valuable treatment for a number of side effects associated with cancer treatment such as anxiety, depression, fatigue, insomnia, nausea, neuropathy or pain. Available weekly on Wednesdays in the Cancer Center. Advanced Care Planning Advance care planning is the process of coming to understand, reflect on, discuss and plan for a time when you cannot make your own medical decisions. This plan is called an advance directive. Advanced Directive is a process of shared decision making with you, your family and your healthcare providers to improve understanding, reflection and discussion about your future healthcare decisions. Make an appointment with the Clinical Navigator at the Cancer Center to begin your advance care planning process. Art Therapy Expressive art therapy groups are designed to allow individuals to experience thoughts, feelings and emotions through the art making process. Art therapy is offered 6 times per year as part of the on-going Cancer Support Circles. Bend, Stretch and Breath is offered weekly and is designed to meet the patient at his/her level of ability and helps to create a path back to wellness. Breath work and gentle postures are introduced to improve total body conditioning; increase mobility and range of motion, improve circulatory flow and relieve muscle tension. Circle of Support for Caregivers Helping someone go through a cancer diagnosis, treatment and recovery requires understanding, encouragement, patience and energy. If you let the stress of care giving progress to burnout, it can harm one's physical and emotional health. This group is designed to provide support, education and resource materials to caregivers. Join this important group on Mondays at 11:00am at the Cancer Center. Food of Love Food of Love is a complimentary food support program whereby nutrient dense, delicious meals are provided to Martin-O'Neil Cancer Center patients who live in Napa County.
