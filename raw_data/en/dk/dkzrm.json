In my experience, doctors have always tried to manage patients based on the best available evidence. David Sackett, credited with pop- ularizing evidence-based medicine defined it as the \"conscientious, ex-plicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients.\" Who could argue with that? One group that seeks to impose unproven top-down protocols on cli-nicians calls itself EvidenceNetwork .ca. They show how one can hijack a theoretically good concept and ma-nipulate the model to create what they believe are valid guidelines per - taining to clinical treatments in which they have little or no expertise. That particular group lists nonclinical self-proclaimed experts who offer \"expert guidance\" in those areas. I believe there are two kinds of experts: those who are biased and know it, and those who are biased and don't know it. Few are capable of dis-tinguishing between their own preju-diced beliefs and factual evidence. I subscribe to the view of theoretical physicist and quantum mechanics sci-entist, Richard Feynman, who wrote, \"Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.\" History tells us experts are often wrong but seldom in doubt. Experts at Decca Records rejected the Beatles in 1962, stating, \"We don't like their sound, and guitar music is on the way out.\" In 1927, Warner Brothers asked, \"Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?\" In 1974, Margaret Thatcher pronounced, \"It will be years\u2014not in my time\u2014before a woman will be - come prime minister.\" Some, naively, believe that their self-generated consensus opinions represent evidence and most, if not all, have inherent biases. The world literature cannot reassure us on the value of published expert evidence, even when peer reviewed. There are a number of research scientists that know and understand the limitations in their field. I have been involved in randomized, pro-spective, double-blind studies, and I support their application where ap-plicable. 1-2 I favor properly designed trials and objective studies when fea-sible, and I am lucky enough to have worked with some who exhibit sci-entific objectivity and understand the clinical role in analyzing research. 3 The BCMJ is a peer-reviewed journal. We do our best to be objec-tive, but it is vital that we recognize the deficiencies that exist in the pro-cess. In 1998, the editor of the British Medical Journal sent an article con- taining eight deliberate mistakes in design and analysis to over 200 peer reviewers. On average, the reviewers picked up less than two of the eight errors. If written descriptions outlining Columbus's experiences in the Amer - icas and Darwin's theory of evolu-tion had undergone peer review by experts, both accounts would likely have been rejected as fantasy. Sci-entists at Amgen, an American drug company, could replicate only 6 of 53 published studies considered land-marks in cancer science, and John Io-annidis from Stanford has declared that most published research findings are probably false. So what is the basis for our ac- ceptance of evidence? One widely used approach is the concept of \"null hypothesis.\" Data are collected and calculations made to determine sig-nificance. A P value below 0.05 (1 in 20), implies statistical significance. This is a commonly used and abused test in experimental studies and peer review. A famous example of harm, in a case involving thousands, oc - curred in the early 2000s when many Vioxx users died as a result of exces-sive faith in the so-called 5% rule of statistical significance. There is a strong case for decision making based on best practices and evidence-based decision making. But that evidence needs to be validated by clinical outcomes and not be depen-dent on self-appointed overseers who lack appropriate expertise and knowl-edge in terms of clinical outcomes. \u2014BD References 1.

To date, 64 local action teams and 11 working groups have focused on practical, sustainable solutions that address communication barriers, service-delivery gaps, and coordina-tion of care locally and system-wide. Much of the work of the Collabora-tive has focused on mitigating the impact of adverse childhood experi-ences (ACEs) and introducing trauma informed-practice and policy, more recently in collaboration with col - leagues in Alberta, who attended an ACEs Summit in Vancouver to share details of their program with 600 attendees. The BC Patient Safety and Qual- ity Council recently recognized the Collaborative for this outstanding work with a 2018 Quality Award in the Living with Illness category. I have written before about the GP Oncology Network at the BC Cancer Agency, an ongoing initiative sup-porting the multidisciplinary network of cancer care in the province. GPs with additional training in oncology help deliver care both at BCCA fa-cilities and at Community Oncology Network clinics. Recently nurse prac-titioners have been added to this mod-el. The successes of this approach are realized by providers working to the full scope of their professional abili-ties, team-based care models, re-spect for complementary skill sets, and good communication among the team. October saw the launch of the BC Emergency Medicine Network. This virtual network links emergency phy-sicians across the province with each other through a member's forum that allows for discussion and practice support. A variety of online clinical practice tools are available for mem-As we begin a new year it is an opportune time for us to focus on new approaches to working together and on the options for improving delivery of medical care in BC. For the gardeners among us, it is time to plant the seeds for the upcoming planting season. And just like them, it is time for us to start cul-tivating opportunities for working to-gether as a medical profession in the coming year. The Oxford English Diction- ary defines a network as \"a group or system of interconnected people or things.\" A community is defined as \"a group of people living in the same place or having a particular charac-teristic in common.\" Both concepts are integral to the work in BC around networks of care. Networks are de-veloping in different ways at many levels throughout our health care system. We strive to deliver comprehensive quality medical care to patients in BC with limited resources and capacity to accomplish this goal. However, this past year practitioners converged to tackle this challenge, and networks and communities of practice are one of the innovative solutions. One such network is the Child and Youth Mental Health and Substance Use (CYMHSU) Collaborative, sup-ported by the Shared Care Commit-tee, one of the Joint Collaborative Committees, representing a partner - ship of Doctors of BC and the BC government. The network of over 2600 includes hundreds of physicians joined by numerous community part-ners including police, school districts, Indigenous groups, community agen-cies, and those with lived experience, all who have been working toward the common goal of improving the lives of children, youth, and families with Planting, growing, and nurturing networks of care bers. Still in its infancy, the network has a long-term goal that includes real-time clin-ical peer-to-peer support through a digi-tal platform. Check out the possibilities on its website, www.bcemergencynetwork .ca, and consider joining if you prac-tise emergency medicine in BC. The Rural Surgical Obstetrical Network is a project supported by the Joint Standing Committee on Ru-ral Issues. It links rural practitioners with enhanced surgical, anesthetic, and obstetrical skills with specialists in larger centres for ongoing clinical and educational support. Strengthen-ing relationships and opportunities to work together are key factors in sta - bilizing low-volume surgical and ob-stetrical programs. Primary care networks are now on the horizon after several years of designing a specific approach for BC. With the implementation of com-munity of practice led and designed patient medical homes and primary care networks, we expect significant progress this year as we tackle prima - ry care access challenges across the province. Team-based care is a key element, but it starts with physicians supporting each other as we work to-gether to address community needs. All networks rely on specific com- munities of practice to efficiently and comprehensively address complex patient needs. Our challenge in all these networks is the need for infra-structure support to enable providers to actually do the job. We need to con-tinue to grow relationships between GPs, specialists, and other providers. 7 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgA 60-year journey If longevity is a sign of quality, then the BCMJ should be proud as we enter our 60th year of pub- lication. Our humble journal started its journey as the voice of the doc-tors of BC in 1959. Looking back at 1959, John Diefenbaker was prime minister of Canada, and Dwight Eisenhower was president of the United States. This was quite a monumental year for our southern neighbors as the states of Alaska and Hawaii joined the Union. At the same time the cold war and the space race were in full swing. Also, Fidel Castro had just come to power in Cuba, and the Da-lai Lama was forced to flee Tibet. Finally, the St. Lawrence Seaway joining the Great Lakes with the At-lantic Ocean was completed. Rawhide , Bonanza, and The Twi- light Zone were TV highlights in 1959, while Ben Hur and Some Like It Hot were taking the big screen by storm. Music died one day in Febru-ary as Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and the \"The Big Bopper\" perished in a plane crash. Also, for better or for worse, Mattel released Barbie in 1959, and she quickly established her longstanding doll monopoly. Not to be outdone, Mr Potato Head, Play Dough, and the Hula Hoop were still going strong. Toy-shopping parents could be seen in drainpipe jeans, pedal pushers, and white T-shirts. The scientific community had their own breakthroughs in 1959. A litter of rabbits was grown from an ovum that underwent in vitro fertil - ization, and for all of you lab geeks out there (you know who the two of you are) acrylamide was first used in gel electrophoresis. In medicine, mercury was discovered as the cause of Minamata disease, and the first allograft was performed. The first bone marrow transplants were done on five Yugoslavian men with radia-tion damage, but unfortunately all of them were rejected (the bone mar - row, not the men). Also in this year, the first known case of human HIV disease was identified in the Belgian Congo. In 1959 a new house would have set you back about $12 400, while you earned $5010 per year. You would have shelled out $2200 for your new car, and paid 25 cents per gallon to fill it with gas. A loaf of bread cost 20 cents, and a movie ticket was a dollar. editorials president's comment Editorials continued from page 5Health authorities need to include physician expertise in program de-sign to better serve the patient and improve relationships between phy-sicians and administration. Govern-ment ministries need to break down the walls between their portfolios to address the needs of patients and communities in a coordinated way. Above all we need to identify, sup - port, and grow the programs that will truly make a difference. We need all partners, including patients and communities, educators, admin-istrators, and providers working to-gether to wrap the care around the patient. These are the ingredients we'll need to grow the networks of care that will revitalize the health care system in British Columbia. \u2014Trina Larsen Soles, MD Doctors of BC President Certi ed Dragon\u00ae Medical Software Sales & TrainingThe KEY to SUCCESS with SPEECH RECOGNITION Solutions CONTACT US TODAY!One-on-one training sessions Customized to your workfl ow and speci c needs Complete initial, basic, and advanced instruction available Exclusive and professionally written training materials Follow up assistance and support speakeasysolutions.com 1-888-964-9109The BCMJ remains a valuable educational voice written primarily by BC physicians for BC physicians.

The current Edito-rial Board is committed to produc-ing a quality journal that honors the legacy handed down by those whose roles we now fill. To celebrate our 60th year, keep your eyes open for little reminders of the years that have passed sprinkled throughout our 10 issues of 2018. Here's to 60 more. \u2014DRR8 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgletters to the editor BC needs to prioritize health beyond health care By late summer, 2017 had seen the death of 1013 British Columbians due to the opioid crisis. 1 Though con- siderable progress has been made through distribution of naloxone kits, increased treatment programs, and the opening of supervised consump-tion and overdose prevention sites, BC seems on track this year to nearly double the number of deaths in 2016. High-risk substance use is often fueled by homelessness, child pov-erty, lack of meaningful employment, and colonial systems that disrupt In-digenous peoples' connections to land and community. These issues cannot be fixed solely through the health system; they require other ministries like Labour, Housing, and Educa-tion. In order to address the upstream determinants of health, government decision-makers need to consider how policies in other sectors can af - fect the public's health. Health in all policies (HiAP) is an approach supported by organizations like the World Health Organization and Canadian Medical Association. 2,3 Under HiAP, government policies that might affect population health undergo health impact assessments, no matter what ministry develops them. For example, if the Ministry of Education closed a school, it could be required to address health impacts like families' use of active transporta-tion (walking and biking to school), social services for at-risk families, and delivery of food security pro-grams. Within Canada, Quebec has already adopted HiAP.4 Farther from home, Scandinavian countries have seen success using this approach to coordinate agencies to combat health issues such as heart disease. 5 The Ministry of Health cannot stand alone in tackling the acute and chronic health issues. While the desig-nation of a Minister of Mental Health and Addictions signals interest in broadening health leadership beyond traditional siloes, there are still addi-tional opportunities for collaboration. By embracing a HiAP approach, the province could reduce the burden on the health care system and improve the health of British Columbians. \u2014Alex Choi, MD, MHSc, CCFP \u2014Alexis Crabtree, MD, PhD, MPH \u2014Geoff McKee, MD, MPH Vancouver References 1.

Speaking to patients about concussions: Does our terminology impact recovery outcomes? Perception is a subjective phenom- enon and, when it comes to medical conditions, it is clear that each person has their own perception of their ail - ment. Notably, the perception can be positive or negative and can have an immense impact on a patient's adher - ence to treatment, recovery, and asso-ciated outcomes. 1-3 The association of a patient's mindset with their clinical outcomes has been demonstrated in a number of conditions, including myo-cardial infarction, rheumatoid arth-ritis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, head and neck can - cer, and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). 1,2 Importantly, it has been suggested that perception may be shaped by the terminology clinicians employ to de-scribe the illness. 3 Whereas the terms concussion and mild traumatic brain injury are often used interchangeably in the medical community, the clini-cal appropriateness of the nomen-clature continues to be debated. 4 The terms may convey altered messages to patients, and it has been argued that only concussion communicates the transient nature of impaired neu-rological function. 4 A negative illness perception in mTBI patients results in increased risk for persistent symp-toms, and the term concussion, in Continued on page 109 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.org MD Financial Management provides financial products and services, the MD Family of Funds and investment counselling services through the MD Group of Companies.

Despite the lack of consensus, the potential influence of terminology on patient expectations and outcomes should not be underestimated. Reiter - ating these concepts to medical train-ees, in the context of mTBI and the conditions listed above, could be an important intervention to counteract negative illness perceptions and thus improve outcomes. \u2014Sarah Fraser, BSc MD Candidate, UBC Southern Medical Program, Class of 2019 \u2014Alexander D.

I sat at the heels of Sir Alexander Fleming in London and discussed cases with Sir Denis Burkitt in Uganda. Thankfully, I have not had to ex- perience the humiliation of Dr Chap-man's colleagues under the faceless bureaucrats who intimidate the doc-tors and nurses working our present-day institutions. Your readers will find this hard to believe, but I was once present at a medical staff meeting with a board of governors regarding a hospital ad-ministrator who, from evidence pre - sented by the doctors, was relieved of his position. I do urge Doctors of BC to sup- port, in every way, those members who have been unfairly dismissed and to slow down the inexorable theft of our profession by bureaucracy. \u2014Robert Holmes, MD Nicola Valley Re: Two-for-one health care: A Canadian compromise I would like to comment on the pro- posal for permitting private health care by a surcharge system in BC. The notion that users of a private health care channel for accessing services that are rationed in Canada should pay additional taxes deserves some com-ment and thought. Canadians have been burdened by increasing taxes based on the Lib-eral government's propensity to over - spend their revenue base and create unsustainable deficits. The increasing tax burden is, to a considerable extent, caused by a po-litical will to increase the number of individuals paid by government min-istries as a redistribution of wealth \"fairness notion.\" This tax burden, which we pay with little complain-ing, is about to get higher with little increase in government services. Citi - zens pay taxes so that medical servic-es can be provided, but because the revenue generated is not sufficient to pay for \"free services\" we must all ex-perience rationing. Now, Dr Andrew Kotaska [BCMJ 2017;59:526-527] tells us that we should pay for our ser - vices three times. Once by paying a high tax rate to cover basic medicare, the second time by making private ar - rangements to access nongovernmen-tal health care facilities, and then a third time by paying a tax penalty for getting timely care that the govern-ment has decided to ration. This might seem fair to Andrew, but it does not qualify as fair in my view. Government has been unwill-ing to add any user-pay features that would supplement health care fund-ing and moderate demand to the system, so we must ration care via a universal slow delivery model. This equation should not be fixed by application of Andrew's Band-Aid. \u2014Jack Pacey, MD, FRCSC Vancouver Development of an interdisciplinary student-run health care clinic There has been growing support for an interdisciplinary health care model, which has demonstrated better out-comes for patients, providers, and the overall health care system. Studies have shown that interprofessional col-laboration results in positive outcomes in chronic disease management, de-creased length of hospital stay, reduced admissions, and harm reduction. 1,2 To implement the interprofession - al care model effectively, early expo-sure for future health care providers is essential. At the University of Brit-ish Columbia, interprofessional edu-cational experiences are relatively limited for health care students. To address this gap in current health care education, the development of a new letters Continued from page 8 Continued on page 1211 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.org 12 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgstudent-run clinic began in 2014. While other student-run clinics in Canada focus on drop-in care deliv- ered by medical students with support from other professions, the Commu-nity Health Initiative by University Students (CHIUS) clinic places an emphasis on having an interdisciplin-ary team see complex patients for a comprehensive assessment with fol - low-up appointments. 3 The CHIUS Three Bridges Student Clinic has completed 2 successful years of op-eration from September 2015 to April 2017, with students from the Faculties of Medicine, Pharmacy, Social Work, Occupational Therapy, and Nursing, seeing patients as a team under the supervision of faculty and medical residents. With an emphasis placed on interdisciplinary collaboration, the teams were given time to collectively interview patients, devise care plans, and deliver interventions. The feedback from students par - ticipating in the clinic has been over - whelmingly positive. Preliminary results from student surveys dem-onstrate a significant increase in un-derstanding the scopes of practice of other health care professionals.

Thank you to Dr Verhulst of the Patterns of Practice Committee for alerting us to MSP's interpretation of overservicing a patient and how we might risk being found at fault in an audit [BCMJ 2017;59:40]. If I receive a request from my patient or a pharmacist for Special Author - ity from Pharmacare, would MSP deem it to be overservicing if I call my patient in to see me just for this and I bill a regular office visit? This service would include, of course, re-viewing the patient's condition, look-ing up the Special Authority criteria, discussing with the patient the need for the drug versus alternatives and their costs, filling in the Special Au-thority form, sending it to Pharma-care, documenting all this, receiving the response from Pharmacare, docu-menting that, and recalling the patient if coverage is declined. I note that we now have over 20 different Pharmacare Special Author - ity forms and 273 drugs that require them. This does not include the low-cost alternative and reference drug program medications. A while back the Society of General Practitioners of BC asked the Medical Services Commission (MSC) to approve a fee to pay doc - tors for submitting Special Authority forms. The MSC refused, stating that a Special Authority form is \"part of a visit.\" Surely this means that it is an MSC-insured service and, therefore, a legitimate reason for an office visit? Now we are getting third-party insurance companies demanding that Pharmacare Special Authority be ap-plied for and refused before they will cover certain drugs. Since this is a third-party request that would not oth-erwise be medically necessary, would we be permitted to charge the patient privately for this service? I am sure many of my colleagues would appreciate your advice on this. Thanks very much. \u2014Eugene Leduc, MD Victoria Re: Am I overservicing my patients? Author replies The Medical Services Commission (MSC), not the Patterns of Practice Committee, has regulatory authority over the MSC Payment Schedule. If changes to the Payment Schedule are sought (e.g., a new form fee), they must go through the Negotiations Committee. The Medicare Protec-tion Act, Section 17, Subsection 1(b) states: \"A person must not charge a beneficiary for materials, consulta-tions, procedures, use of an office, clinic or other place or for any other matters that relate to the rendering of a benefit.\" The MSC rationale is twofold: one, the drug prescription is medically necessary; two, completing the Special Authority form is a matter related to the rendering of the benefit. Also, section C. 5 of the Gen- eral Preamble to the MSC Payment Schedule states: If it is not medically necessary letters Continued from page 1013 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgfor a patient to be personally reassessed prior to prescrip-tion renewal, specialty re - ferral, release of laboratory results, etc., claims for these services must not be made to MSP regardless of whether or not a medical practitioner chooses to see his/her patients personally or speak with them via the telephone.So, your discretion is advised. Call the patient in if it is medically necessary. The request by the in-surer doesn't really change things. If the drug you prescribe is medi-cally required and would normally be available to the patient under the Pharmacare program, you must fol-low the above constraints. The insurer is making sure that Pharmacare is the insurer of first resort. \u2014Lorne Verhulst, MD, Chair, Patterns of Practice Committee Re: \"The smells of summer\" I very much enjoyed your \"ranting\" in your editorial, \"The smells of sum-mer,\" [BCMJ 2017;59:344-345] and of course I agree very strongly. You may recall my Premise piece, \"To-ward smoke-free multi-unit dwell - ings\" [BCMJ 2011;53:400-401]. Unfortunately our various lev- els of government have done little to move this issue forward over the last 6 years. Things are much better in the United States, with the Housing and Urban Development Department mandating that all public housing agencies nationwide have complete smoke-free policies by July 2018. 1 On a personal level, getting the 75% strata vote needed to adopt strict - er nonsmoking bylaws may not be as difficult as you think. Our condo im-plemented such a bylaw last winter, to my surprise getting 91% in favor of a complete indoor-outdoor ban, includ-ing balconies, with no grandfathering. My only cautionary comment would be to make sure that the policy applies to the interiors of individual units, not just to balconies, because if one starts getting exposure into one's unit through various connections (which happened to us in 2010 in an-other place, ultimately forcing us to move) the situation is much harder to mitigate than a balcony source. I do realize that you were joking about en-couraging smokers to increase their own exposure by smoking indoors with their doors and windows closed, but an even better idea is the com-pletely enclosed smoker's helmet that some advocates I know would like to see smokers forced to wear! \u2014Stuart H.

Understanding herbal medicine and liver toxicity I am concerned about a letter pub- lished in the Personal View section of the September 2017 issue [BCMJ 2017;59:348]. The letter reports on two patients who suffered from acute liver failure that was \"strongly felt\" to be caused by commercially ob-tained herbal remedies. The authors assert that \"Drug-induced liver injury from these products is not uncom-mon. In China, such injury from Chi-nese herbal medicine is estimated to be 25% of all reported cases (unpub-lished work from Dr Qi Xing-shun, General Hospital Shenyang Military District, 8 August 2017).\" That makes it sound like 25% of people who take Chinese herbs end up with liver damage. That's incor - rect. Assuming the 25% noted, but not published, by some doctor in China (not Canadian numbers) is correct, we still have no idea how many people that is. The statistic is meaningless.letters Continued on page 14 14 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgNext, the authors state that they \"strongly feel that regulation of these products, on either the federal or pro-vincial level, needs to be consistent with that applied to the pharmaceu-tical industry\" and that \"the public needs to be made aware of the poten-tial dangers of these products.\" Some people think that the world of natural health products is like the Wild West\u2014anyone can sell any-thing with any claim. This is fully false. According to the Government of Canada website, all natural health products are required to have a natu-ral product number (NPN), and in or - der to get that product licence, Health Canada needs to assess that the prod-uct is \"safe, effective, and of high quality.\" Where did those two liver patients get their herbal products? That's the question I would ask. Additionally, the warning is unnecessarily alarmist. If we look at the numbers, the risks are not greatest with natural remedies. Specifically, when it comes to liver damage, Dr Michael Rieder, a pediat - ric clinical pharmacologist at Western University states that acetaminophen is the \"most common cause of liver injury. Period. Full stop.\" 1 Every year there are about 4500 hospitalizations in Canada caused by acetaminophen overdose, with approximately 700 of those accidental, according to Health Canada. 2 Unfortunately, letters like this provoke physicians to close the door to natural remedies and proper dis-cussion. Then some patients don't tell their physicians about the supple-ments they are taking. My patients sometimes say that their doctors will shame them, scare them, and tell them they are wasting their money. Some patients have even told me they're afraid that their doctors won't even see them anymore. We would all be better served by opening the discussion with each oth-er and with our patients in a less pro-vocative manner. \u2014Melissa Carr, DrTCM, BSc Registered Doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine Vancouver References 1.

Understanding herbal medicine and liver toxicity. Authors reply Prior to January 2004, nontraditional herbal medications were classified as food under the Food and Drug Act, which exempts Health Canada from providing any safety or efficacy data. 1 The Natural Health Products (NHPs) Regulations were then created to ad-dress Canadians' concerns about the safety, efficacy, and manufacturing process of natural health products in Canada\u2014a work still in progress. 2 The fact that nontraditional medi - cations, including herbal and tradi-tional Chinese medicine preparations, are little regulated compared to tradi-tional pharmaceutical medications is not a matter of debate. Not only is efficacy undocumented by clinical evidence, potential harm is underre-ported. In addition, there is minimal quality assurance in terms of manu-facturing of these products, result-ing in variable potency and potential mislabeling of active ingredients. Dr Carr seems unaware of the differ - ence in the extent and rigor between Continued from page 14 Health Canada's approval processes for drugs versus NHPs. Prior to being approved for public consumption, a traditional medica - tion is studied extensively in preclini - cal and clinical trials and is subject to tight surveillance post-public con-sumption to detail those rare side effects that might not have been ap-parent in the trials. In fact, many drugs have been pulled off the market at this stage. Lack of such standards is obvious when it comes to nontradi-tional medications. Dr Carr also raises the point that traditional medications are hepato-toxic, citing acetaminophen as an example. We are not disputing that traditional medications are associated with hepatotoxicity, or the fact that ac-etaminophen is responsible for most cases of acute liver injury (ALI)\u2014al-though, invariably, most acetamino-phen-induced ALIs are due to acute or chronic overdoses, and, in fact, acetaminophen is one of the safest analgesic medications if used appro-priately. The point is missed that the hepatotoxic adverse effects of tradi-tional medications are known and well documented, which allows physicians and pharmacists to monitor patients closely for any early signs of harm. Finally, Dr Carr questions, \"Where did those two liver patients get their herbal products?\" to which we an-swer, commercial traditional herbal clinics in Greater Vancouver! Consumption of exogenous com pounds, whether traditional pharma ceu ticals or nontraditional medications, can induce acute liver injury.

Extra-articular distal radius fractures, which are typi-cally the result of a low-energy event, can be treated with conservative man-agement, while intra-articular frac-tures may require surgery. In younger patients, intra-articular distal radius fractures are usually a result of a high-energy event, while in older patients, these injuries can result from a low-energy event such as a fall on an out-stretched hand. Initial management of distal ra - dius fractures, whether intra-articular or not, involves neurovascular and soft-tissue assessment, reduction, and immobilization. Standard AP and lat - eral radiographs are sufficient in the majority of cases. Advanced imaging is used infrequently, most commonly where there is minimal intra-articular displacement and the clinician is contemplating the suitability of non- operative management. The Ameri - can Academy of Orthopaedic Sur - geons advises surgical reconstruction for fractures with post-reduction radi-al shortening > 3 mm, dorsal tilt > 10 degrees, or intra-articular displace-ment or step-off > 2 mm. 3 However, intra-articular step-off 1 mm has been shown to correlate with a lower Short Form 36 score and the devel - opment of arthritis. 4,5 As such, many surgeons may accept a 2 mm gap, but prefer < 1 mm articular incongruity. 6-8V olar distal radius plating, locking or nonlocking, is the most common surgical treatment of intra-articular distal radius fractures. These range from the more conventional single volar plate to fragment-specific plat-ing systems. In cases where the sur - geon feels internal fixation is not an option, such as extreme distal com - minution, external fixation with liga - mentotaxis may be used to achieve reduction. 8 This tends to be more sal- vage than internal fixation, but in a limited number of cases, may produce the best results for difficult fractures. Dorsal plating remains an option, but is infrequently used due to concerns of extensor tendon aggravation or rupture. As such, the indications are very limited and dorsal plating is usu-ally removed once the fracture has healed, while volar implants are usu-ally left in situ. Postoperative immobilization, varying from casting to removable splints, is typically for 2 to 8 weeks. Timing depends on fracture/construct stability, bone quality, patient factors, and surgeon preference. Patients may require physiotherapy for motion and strengthening. Full weight-bearing is usually started 3 months postopera-tively based on radiographic and clin - ical union; activity as tolerated may begin once full range of motion and fracture union have been achieved. If you have questions regarding an injured-worker patient with an intra-articular distal radius fracture, please call a medical advisor in your nearest WorkSafeBC office. \u2014Derek Smith, MD, FRCSC WorkSafeBC Orthopedic Specialist Advisor References 1.

An estimated 25 700 new cases were identified in Canada in 2016, and 3500 of these were in British Colum-bia. 1 Breast cancer remains big news. Articles on breast cancer are common in the popular press, and attention is heightened every time a celebrity fac-es this diagnosis. Pink ribbons can be found on just about any product, with portions of purchases directed toward breast cancer-related organizations. While this is the most common cancer in women, and certainly the one that receives that most media at-tention, many women either signifi-cantly overestimate or significantly underestimate their personal breast cancer risk. 2 Either can affect a wom- an's decision to pursue screening and seek medical attention for breast con-cerns and can also increase her anxi-ety regarding new breast symptoms. Although many breast complaints will not be the result of a malignancy, thorough assessment is still required to exclude malignancy. Primary care providers are faced with what can be the daunting task of helping patients navigate the pro-cess of investigating imaging abnor - malities. Multiple appointments for further imaging and biopsy can be required, and patients can become in-creasingly anxious as they await the results of these tests. This article has been peer reviewed.This first in a two-part theme issue dedicated to breast cancer focuses on issues in diagnosis. In the first article, Dr Colin Mar and colleagues provide an overview of the Screening Mam-mography Program of BC and de - scribe current breast cancer screening policies in the province. The authors include information on the benefits, limitations, and downsides of screen-ing, and encourage primary care pro-viders to discuss these with women at average risk for breast cancer to fa - cilitate informed decision making. In the second article, Dr Amie Padilla-Thornton and colleagues re-view the approaches to investigating breast health concerns in symptomat - ic patients and imaging abnormalities identified in asymptomatic patients. The authors stress the importance of assessment and describe some of the challenges primary care providers and surgeons in different centres may face in organizing investigations. In the third article, Dr Christine Wilson and colleagues review the Provincial Breast Health Strategy, a plan to facilitate coordinated care in the diagnostic workup for breast ab - normalities. The authors discuss the current state of diagnostic services in the province and demonstrate the effi-cacy of a coordinated system in terms of both timely investigation and cost savings.

ABSTRACT: Breast cancer contin- ues to affect the women of British Columbia and impose a significant health care burden. Population-based screening mammography remains the most accessible and scientifically validated test for de-tecting breast cancer and reducing breast cancer mortality. Screening is provided across the province by the Screening Mammography Program of BC. Downsides of screening in-clude exposure to ionizing radiation, false-positive results, and overdiag-nosis. Current screening policy in BC is based on age and other determi-nants of risk, including family histo-ry and genetic factors. For example, routine screening every 2 years is recommended for asymptomatic women age 50 to 74 of average risk, while routine screening every year is recommended for women age 40 to 74 with a first-degree relative with breast cancer. The Screening Mam-mography Program compiles data for calculating numerous outcomes, including participation and return rates, time to diagnosis measures, and sensitivity and specificity indi-cators. Breast density is an issue a woman and her primary care provid-er may need to consider, since nor - mal dense breast tissue may impede detection of cancer. Imaging tech-nologies undergoing investigation to address this and other challenges in-clude digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By discussing imag-ing options and screening benefits, limitations, and downsides with women, primary care providers can facilitate informed decision making. The potential impact of breast cancer on women in British Columbia means that primary care providers should be prepared to address the female patient's question, \"Should I get a mammogram?\" It can be helpful to begin with a brief review of some principles of screening from the classic World Health Organization report by Wilson and Jungner: The condition sought should be an important health problem. There should be an available treatment. There should be an acceptable test. 1 These principles have undergone multiple revisions over the years and additional criteria have been pro-posed, including: There should be scientific evidence Dr Mar is the medical director of the Screen- ing Mammography Program of BC and a clinical assistant professor in the Depart-ment of Radiology at UBC. Ms Sam is the operations director of the Screening Mam-mography Program of BC. Dr Wilson is the director of breast imaging at BC Cancer in Vancouver and a clinical associate profes-sor in the Department of Radiology at UBC. This article has been peer reviewed.21 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgBreast cancer screening in British Columbia: A guide to discussion with patients of screening program effectiveness. There should be quality assurance. The overall benefits of screening should outweigh the harm.2 Although breast cancer screening, treatment, and surveillance in BC have contributed to outcomes match - ing national and international stan-dards, 3 the disease remains the most common cancer in women in Canada, and the second leading cause of can-cer death as of 2015. 4 In 2010 the life - time risk for developing breast cancer was 1 in 9 and the lifetime mortality risk was 1 in 30. Since 1986 there has been a steady decline in the age- standardized breast cancer mortal-ity rate, which now stands at 16 per 100 000 in BC. The age-standardized 5-year relative survival ratio for 2006 to 2008 was 88% across the country. 4 Population screening for breast cancer in BC began in 1988 with the Screening Mammography Program (SMP). There are SMP centres locat-ed in all five health authorities, with 36 fixed sites across the province and three mobile units providing access for remote and underserviced regions. The program is completing a transi-tion to digital mammography, which facilitates the transfer of images be-tween centres, and has been shown to improve cancer detection in younger women and those with dense breast tissue. 5 Evidence for screening mammography The evidence for breast cancer screen- ing with mammography has en-gendered much discussion. Several randomized controlled trials were conducted prior to 2000 and meta-analyses of these demonstrated re-ductions in breast cancer mortality with screening of RR 0.80 to 0.82. 6-8 These studies may, however, under - estimate the current effectiveness of screening given their age and use of intention-to-treat analysis. Mammog-raphy technology has evolved since 2000, and quality assurance programs have been developed. Observational studies have yielded more recent data. These include the work of Coldman and colleagues, who considered over 2 million women age 40 to 79 in 7 of 12 Canadian screening programs during the period 1990 to 2009, 9 and observed a 40% mortality reduction, with little variation by age. The num-ber needed to participate in screening to prevent a single breast cancer death within 10 years decreased with age from 1247 for women first screened at age 40 to 49, to 498 for women first screened at age 70 to 79. The Canadian Task Force on Pre- ventive Health Care (CTFPHC) last issued guidelines for breast cancer screening in 2011. 7 These included a weak recommendation for mammog-raphy every 2 to 3 years for women age 50 to 69, and the same for women 70 to 74. Evidence of similar quality supporting a weak recommendation for mammography for women age 40 to 49 was reported, but a recom-mendation was not provided after the CTFPHC cited a less favorable bene-fit-to-harm ratio in this age group. A working group of the Interna- tional Agency for Research on Can-cer (IARC) subsequently published an evidence review in 2015. 10 They concurred with the CTFPHC in that they found sufficient evidence to rec-ommend screening for the 50 to 69 and 70 to 74 age groups. They were, however, unable to find sufficient evi-dence to make a recommendation for women 40 to 49, citing fewer studies for this age group. The American Cancer Society (ACS) released a guideline update in 2015 11 that included a strong rec- ommendation for regular screening mammography starting at age 45 and a qualified recommendation for annu-al screening for women 45 to 54. The ACS update also included qualified recommendations for biennial screen-ing beginning at age 55, and contin-ued screening at 70 to 74 to be based on life expectancy. Finally, the update included a qualified recommendation that women \"should have the oppor - tunity to begin annual screening be-tween the ages of 40 and 44 years.\" Since a qualified recommendation indicates \"there is clear evidence of benefit, but less certainty about either the balance of benefits and harms, or about patients' values and prefer - ences,\" 11 different patients offered this opportunity will make differ - ent decisions and discussion will be required. In these cases, the primary care provider has an important role to play in facilitating informed decision making. None of the three organizations has found sufficient evidence to sup-port a recommendation for routine clinical breast examination or breast self-exam. The American Cancer So-ciety has suggested that the time re - quired for clinical breast examination instead be used for discussion of the benefits, limitations, and downsides of mammography. Downsides of screening mammography As noted previously, a discussion of screening requires considering downsides. These include exposure to ionizing radiation, patient anxiety, false-positives, and overdiagnosis. The radiation risk posed by current standards in digital mammography is low. For a woman undergoing mam - mography at age 40, the estimated life-time attributable risk (LAR) of a fatal breast cancer is 1.3 cases per 100 000. Continuation with annual mammog-raphy to the age of 80 is associated with an LAR of 20 to 25 cases. 12 The IARC included a statement in its 2015 22 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.org Breast cancer screening in British Columbia: A guide to discussion with patients guidelines that the risk of radiation- induced malignancy is outweighed by the benefits of mammography. 10 False-positives in screening mam - mography are inherent to the practice. In 2015 the positive predictive value in the SMP for first screens was 5.2% and for subsequent screens was 7.0%, values that both met national targets. 13 Anxiety caused by false-positives is related to receiving notification of an abnormal result and undergoing consequent image-guided or surgi-cal biopsy. Such anxiety has been documented, 14 but has not been found to have a measurable health utility decrement. 15 There are also varying morbidity and risks associated with different biopsy procedures. Over - diagnosis involves the detection by mammography of a malignancy that would never have become clinically apparent before the patient's death. The issue then is one of results that precipitate overtreatment. The mea-surement of this is complicated, pri-marily by uncertainty regarding the true incidence of breast cancer, the subject of much discussion and de-bate. Recently published overdiagno-sis rates range from 2.3% in a Danish population-based cohort study 16 to 48.3% in a later Danish study that in-cluded findings for invasive cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). 17 A retrospective study of provincial SMP data estimated rates of 5.4% for invasive cancer and 17.3% when DCIS was included, with the risk of overdiagnosis being highest in older women. 18 In discussing this issue with patients it remains important to recog-nize that the lifetime risk for overdi-agnosis is low, in the order of 1.0%. 19 Moreover, it is not currently possible at the time of diagnosis to distinguish between tumors that will not progress from those that will. The decision will therefore be based on the patient's tol-erance of the relative risks.BC screening policy Population screening recommen-dations for breast cancer in BC are categorized by age and other deter - minants of risk, including family history and genetic factors ( Table ). Women eligible for screening are asymptomatic, without a personal history of breast cancer, and with-out breast implants. Women age 40 to 49 are encouraged to consider the benefits relative to the downsides and limitations in discussion with their primary care provider. A limitation for women in this age group, where the incidence of cancer is lower than in older age groups, is the greater prevalence of dense breast tissue that may impede cancer detection. 20 For women at high risk due to a genetic predisposition or a history of chest wall irradiation between the ages of 10 and 30 years, screening MRI is recommended in addition to annual mammography, although MRI is not provided through the SMP. Regarding clinical breast exami - nation, there is no recommendation for or against this practice in asymptom-atic women. Finally, the policy recom-mends against breast self-examination as an alternative to mammography. Table. Screening Mammography Program of BC guidelines for primary care providers.

The SMP compiles data for calculating numerous outcome measures that are then shared in a var - iety of ways. The program's annual report is the most comprehensive of these, and may be accessed at www.bc cancer.bc.ca/screening/Documents/SMP_Report-AnnualReport2016 .pdf. The report includes participa-tion and return rates, time to diagnosis measures, and sensitivity and speci - ficity indicators, and compares these indicators to national standards where available. The program also considers participation by region and by select - ed ethnic groups. In 2015 the provincial participa- tion rate for women age 50 to 69 was 52.4%, a rate that has remained both relatively stable and below the na - tional target of 70.0% since 2000. 13 Participation rates by women age 50 to 69 in the Northeast health service delivery area (40.0%) and Kootenay Boundary health service delivery area (44.0%) were below the provincial average. Data were compiled for cli - ents identified as First Nations, East/South East Asian, and South Asian. The participation of women within the same age range in all three groups rose over the previous 5 years, and lies above the provincial average. This interpretation may, however, be limited by underestimation of the eth-nic group populations. 13 More than 250 000 mammograms were performed by the SMP in 2015. Screening outcomes considered in - cluded normal and abnormal results, image-guided and surgical biopsies performed, and breast cancers de - tected ( Figure 1 ). The percentage of women referred for further test-ing because of an abnormal screen-ing mammogram (i.e., the abnormal call rate) was 9.1%.

The percentage of women with an abnormal mammo-gram who were diagnosed with breast cancer (i.e., the positive predictive value) was 6.1%. 13 In addition to the outcome mea- sures already noted, individualized data are compiled for each radiolo-gist screener in the program and for each provincial health authority. The SMP also promotes quality assurance through a client satisfaction survey sent to selected women attending pro-gram sites across the province. Each SMP site and radiologist maintains mammography-specific accredita-tion from the Canadian Association of Radiologists. This requires adher - ence to a nationally recognized set of guidelines that ensures the quality of the examination and the competence of the screener. Finally, specific poli-cies regulate the systematic review of randomly sampled abnormal findings and cancers diagnosed. This occurs at both the site level to facilitate direct feedback and at the program level to ensure overall effectiveness.Breast density Risk stratification in the current SMP screening policy is based primar - ily on age and family history, but another factor a woman and her pri-mary care provider should consider is breast density. This is a measurement of the proportion of the breast com-posed of dense (i.e., nonfatty) tissue, and the probability of masking a can-cer. Dense tissue is relatively radio-opaque and thus appears white on a mammogram. Although normal, such tissue may obscure cancer and thus impede its detection. 20 A set of mam- mograms ( Figure 2 ) illustrates the difference between dense and non-dense breasts, and how cancer may resemble dense tissue. Given this masking effect, any breast changes or symptoms should be followed up, re-gardless of a normal screening mam-mogram result. Breast density is also a risk fac- tor for incident cancer, particularly when the breast is extremely dense. A meta-analysis in 2006 considered over 14 000 breast cancer cases with 226 000 controls to determine a 4.64- fold risk when the proportion of dense to non-dense breast tissue was equal to or greater than 75%, 21 relative to a breast of less than 5%. Breast can-cer in the setting of dense breast tis-sue has not, however, been associated with an increased risk of death. 22 The reporting of breast density with mammogram results has been the focus of much recent discussion. As of early 2016, 24 American states have enacted legislation that man-date this reporting. 23 While there is no legislative requirement in Canada to report on breast density, the SMP pol-icy on reporting of breast density is currently under review. For now, the information is available upon patient request, with the understanding that this risk factor should not be consid-ered in isolation, but in combination with age, family history, and other risk factors. 24 At this time, there have been no guideline revisions regarding supplemental screening for women with dense breasts. Figure 2. Mammograms illustrating the challenge breast density may pose in their interpretation. A: Low opacity seen in non-dense breast with a high proportion of fat. B: Increased opacity seen in a dense breast. C: Opacity seen in both normal dense breast tissue (solid arrow) and adjacent cancer (dashed arrow). A B C25 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgBreast cancer screening in British Columbia: A guide to discussion with patients Emerging technologies Mammography remains the most ac- cessible and scientifically validated test for breast cancer screening, and the sole modality included in guide-lines for women of average risk. It is, however, helpful to have a basic understanding of some of the other breast imaging modalities that are the focus of ongoing research, and may arise in discussion with patients. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is commonly referred to as the 3-D mammogram. Indeed, this ex-amination utilizes the technology of mammography to produce a series of two-dimensional images of a single breast. These are acquired through an arc trajectory, and ultimately viewed as a three-dimensional image set. Multiple studies have demonstrated the ability of DBT to increase cancer detection while decreasing the rate of patient recall for further evalua - tion. 25 A prospective trial integrating 2-D and 3-D mammography to screen over 7000 women in 2013 found an additional 2.7 cancers were detected per 1000 screens, and false-positives were reduced by an estimated 17.2%. 26 Two sites within the SMP are currently participating in a large multicentre trial to evaluate the role of DBT in screening. Ultrasound is integral to breast imaging in the diagnostic setting, and its role in screening is evolving. It is of particular interest in the con-text of dense breast tissue. An earlier prospective multicentre trial followed women over three rounds of annual mammography with and without sup-plemental ultrasound. Inclusion cri-teria were a breast density of at least 50% and at least one other risk factor, such as a personal history of breast cancer. An additional 3.7 cancers per 1000 screens were detected, but with a false-positive rate of 16%. 27 SMP screening policy indicates the use of MRI for high-risk women with genetic or familial risks or prior mantle radiation exposure. MRI has demonstrated high sensitivity for de-tecting breast cancer, but the use of this modality is limited by examina - tion time and geographic availability. Recent evaluation of abbreviated im-aging protocols for this modality may, however, eventually allow its use for other risk categories by increasing ac-cess through shortened time required per visit. 28 Other imaging modalities such as thermography and nuclear medicine tests, including positron emission to-mography, have not been validated for population screening. Facilitating an informed decision By increasing awareness of risk factors for breast cancer, the SMP hopes to help women in BC age 40 and older make an informed deci - sion about screening mammography. When researchers analyzed provin - cial screening data for over 2 million women age 40 to 74 screened be-tween 2000 and 2009, they found de-creased false-positives and increased cancer detection with increasing age, and increased cancer detection with a positive family history. The main fac-tors associated with false-positives were time since last screening and a previous false-positive. 29 These and other findings were used to develop the online Breast Cancer Screening Decision Aid of BC Cancer (http://decisionaid.screeningbc.ca), which generates a response after a user an-swers six questions, including \"How old are you?,\" and \"When was your last screening?\" The response indi-cates the likelihood of three events: having a breast cancer found, hav - ing a false-positive mammogram, and having a false-positive biopsy. The user is then advised to print the re-sponse \"and discuss with your doctor to determine if screening is right for you.\" Research within the program is now underway to consider the roles of both breast density and ethnicity within BC and Canada, and this may further individualize the assessment of risk. Summary Both population-based screening and treatment advances have improved breast cancer outcomes. This dis-ease, however, continues to impose a significant burden on the health of women across Canada. 4 Mammog- raphy remains the most scientific-ally validated screening test to reduce breast cancer mortality. A woman's participation in a mammography screening program is best predicat - ed on an informed decision. This re-quires considering risk factors and understanding the limitations and downsides of screening. We encourage the public to use the Breast Cancer Screening Decision Aid discussed above and to access resources for general information on screening (www.screeningbc.ca). We also encourage primary care provid-ers to take advantage of the continuing professional development resources available (http://ubccpd.ca/course/bca-screening-update). Breast cancer screening policy in BC will continue to evolve through ongoing internal data analysis, ap-praisal of the medical literature and review of working group guidelines that address risk factors such as breast density, and the development of other breast imaging modalities .

ABSTRACT: The process leading to diagnosis of breast cancer has changed over the past 20 years with improvements in diagnostic imaging and a shift from surgical biopsy to image-guided core needle biopsy. History-taking and physical exami-nation, diagnostic breast imaging, and biopsy are essential when eval-uating breast concerns, as is the use of the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) when describing findings. Assessment of the concordance between physical examination findings, imaging, and biopsy pathology is also essential to diagnosis, and minimizes surgi-cal intervention. The roles of the primary care physician, radiologist, and surgeon have changed as well over the past 20 years, meaning that the optimal management of patients with breast concerns is now multi-disciplinary. Referring physicians have different roles in navigating pa-tients through the diagnostic system in different communities. The evaluation of breast health concerns and the diagnosis of breast cancer have changed significantly over the past 20 years due to advances in imaging technol-ogy and pathology techniques as well as increased interdisciplinary man-agement of breast problems. The referral pathways for diag- nostic breast imaging address both the evaluation of a presenting breast complaint in the symptomatic patient and the evaluation of an abnormality identified on screening mammogra-phy in an asymptomatic patient. The diagnostic imaging workup for each requires careful risk assessment, use of the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon, and concordance assessment of the physi-cal examination, imaging, and pathol-ogy results. If these components of the patient's workup are not concor - dant, further investigation is neces-sary to rule out malignancy. History and physical examination When patients present with breast concerns, a detailed clinical history should be obtained and a physical examination performed to clarify the symptoms and physical findings and determine the need for further investigation with diagnostic breast imaging. Palpable lumps or areas of thickening, nipple discharge, and breast pain are among the most com-mon presenting complaints. A lump or area of thickening should be assessed for any features of concern for breast cancer, such as hard or irregular texture and apparent Drs Padilla-Thornton, Farrell, and Gordon are radiologists in Vancouver.

Physiologic nipple discharge should be differentiated from patho-logic nipple discharge. Physiologic discharge is bilateral, involves mul-tiple ducts, is milky/yellow/green in color, and is nonspontaneous. This type of discharge does not require di-agnostic medical imaging. Pathologic discharge is unilateral, involves a sin-gle duct, is clear/bloody/serosangui-nous in color, and is spontaneous. A physical examination is the first step in the evaluation of breast pain. The location and characteristics of the pain help to differentiate breast pain from chest wall pain. Chest wall pain is commonly located at the cos-tochondral junctions and over the lateral chest wall rather than in the breast itself. Physiologic breast pain is characterized as cyclical, nonfo -cal, and bilateral, and is typically due to hormonal or age-related changes. Physiologic breast and chest wall pain do not require diagnostic breast imag-ing as pain of this nature has not been shown to correlate with the presence of breast cancer. 1 Breast pain that is persistent, noncyclical, unilateral, and, most importantly, focal, may in-dicate underlying breast pathology. Diagnostic breast imaging is indi- cated when a palpable breast lump or thickening, suspicious skin changes, pathologic nipple discharge, or focal breast pain are confirmed on physi-cal examination. In the absence of suspicious physical examination find-ings, screening mammography is recommended. If an abnormality is identified on screening mammography, a physical examination of the breast should be performed to determine if the finding is image-detected only or associated with findings on examination. Ideally, breast examination should occur prior to a core needle biopsy (CNB) to al-low for accurate clinical assessment of the abnormality in question. Diagnostic breast imaging There are several reasons a patient may be referred for diagnostic breast imaging. This specialized imaging is used to evaluate a physical examina-tion finding or to further characterize an abnormality identified on a screen-ing mammogram in an asymptomatic patient. In addition, diagnostic breast imaging should be scheduled on a routine surveillance basis for patients with breast prostheses and previous-ly treated breast cancers or high-risk lesions. Bilateral diagnostic mammogra- phy and targeted ultrasound focused on the area of clinical concern are used to evaluate the majority of breast health concerns. Digital breast tomo-synthesis, a form of 3-D or volumetric mammography, is becoming increas-ingly available for use in diagnostic breast imaging and permits better dif-ferentiation between normal and ab-normal tissue. 2 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used in limit - ed circumstances, such as for screen-ing patients with a known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation or a history of mantle radiation between age 10 and 30, for assessment of breast prosthe - ses that may have ruptured, for as-sessment of indeterminate lesions, for assessment of pathologic nipple discharge, and for staging of breast cancers, particularly if there is multi - focality or lobular histology. 3 Categories of risk The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System, 4 published by the Amer - ican College of Radiology (ACR) and summarized in Table 1 , provides standardized descriptions of findings that communicate the likelihood of breast cancer based on the imaging Category Management Likelihood of cancer 0 Needs additional imaging or prior examsRecall for additional imaging or obtain prior studiesn/a 1 Negative Routine screening Essentially 0% 2 Benign Routine screening Essentially 0% 3 Probably benign Short-interval follow-up (6 months)> 0% to 2% 4 Suspicious Tissue diagnosis 4A Low suspicion for malignancy (> 2% to 10%) 4B Moderate suspicion for malignancy (> 10% to 50%) 4C High suspicion for malignancy (> 50% to 95%) 5 Highly suggestive of malignancyTissue diagnosis > 95% 6 Known biopsy-proven malignancySurgical excision when clinically appropriaten/aTable 1. Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) final assessment categories.429 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgCurrent evaluation of breast health concerns and diagnosis of breast cancer workup. The BI-RADS assessment of risk ultimately determines the need for an image-guided needle biopsy. Patients with imaging studies cat - egorized as BI-RADS 1 (negative) or BI-RADS 2 (conclusively benign) do not require further imaging workup. Lesions assessed as BI-RADS 3 have an estimated malignancy risk of less than 2% and follow-up imaging is recommended at 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure stability. Lesions assessed as BI-RADS 4 have an estimated ma-lignancy risk of between 2% and 95% and biopsy is recommended. With this large range of risk, many radiolo-gists subdivide BI-RADS 4 into three categories based on positive predic-tive values: 4A (less than 2% to less than or equal to 10% risk), 4B (greater than 10% to less than or equal to 50% risk), and 4C (greater than 50% to less than or equal to 95% risk). Lesions assessed as BI-RADS 5 have an esti-mated risk of malignancy greater than 95%, require core needle biopsy, and should have surgical excision even if the pathology from the biopsy does not confirm malignancy. During the diagnostic breast im- aging appointment, the radiologist will integrate elements from this de-tailed assessment by correlating the findings on the different imaging modalities. The radiologist will then prepare a report providing a final BI-RADS assessment score and guid-ance. Typically, the report will make one of five recommendations:1. The imaging is incomplete and has not as yet permitted thorough as-sessment of the presenting clinical concern (BI-RADS 0). Additional imaging is required with final man-agement options to be detailed in a subsequent report. 2. The findings are negative (BI-RADS 1) or benign (BI-RADS 2) and the patient can be discharged from undergoing further diagnostic breast imaging. If the patient is old-er than 40, routine screening mam - mography will be recommended. 3. The findings are estimated to have a greater than 98% likelihood of being benign (BI-RADS 3) and follow-up imaging in 6, 12, and 24 months is required to demonstrate stability, at which point the find-ings will be considered definitively benign. 4. An abnormality identified is esti-mated to have a greater than 2% likelihood of being malignant (BI-RADS 4 or BI-RADS 5), and an image-guided biopsy is required for definitive pathologic diagnosis. 5. Depending on the presenting com-pliant, referral to a breast specialist or surgeon may be recommended. A very small subset of breast can- cers will not be detected on a mam - mogram or breast ultrasound, and negative findings on imaging should not be cause for a delay in diagno-sis of breast cancer. Any suspicious findings from a physical examination require further imaging and biopsy. In this situation, referral to a surgeon is advised. Image-detected breast abnormalities Nonpalpable breast lesions (mass- es, calcifications, asymmetries, and architectural distortion) can be iden-tified on screening mammograms as well as incidentally on diagnostic breast imaging done for other indica - tions. The evaluation of such abnor - malities focuses on assessing the risk for malignancy. Patients should have an examination to determine whether there is an associated physical finding; however, in cases where there are no associated physical findings to guide the treating clinician, the BI-RADS reporting system and radiology- pathology concordance statements are particularly useful in determining the need for further management and follow-up. Core needle biopsy Core needle biopsy (CNB) of breast lesions is the preferred initial invasive diagnostic procedure, 5-9 and image guidance by ultrasound, mammog - raphy, or MRI is recommended to increase the accuracy of targeting. 8,10 CNB is able to accurately diagnose Core needle biopsy of breast lesions is the preferred initial invasive diagnostic procedure, and image guidance is recommended to increase the accuracy of targeting.30 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgmost breast lesions and results in an improved cosmetic outcome for the pa-tient and cost savings to the health care system. As well, CNB can decrease the number of operations that a patient requires. 7,8 CNB is safe and does not cause dissemination of cancer.7 The guidance modality chosen de- pends on the conspicuity of the lesion. Most masses are seen clearly on ultra - sound, and can therefore be biopsied with ultrasound guidance. For lesions seen on mammography, but not vis-ible on ultrasound, biopsy with ste-reotactic or tomosynthesis guidance is used. Either way, the procedures are well tolerated under local anesthe-sia. CNB of breast lesions is now the standard of care and surgical biopsy should be performed only when core needle biopsy is not possible. 5-9,11 Ob- taining preoperative core needle biop-sy diagnoses of breast lesions in more than 90% to 95% of patients is a qual-ity indicator in breast surgery inter - nationally. 5,6,9 CNB pathology results are classified as benign, high-risk, or malignant. 8,12 Concordance assessment Concordance assessment is an in-tegral part of core needle biopsy. For an image-guided CNB, \"con-cordance refers to the agreement of imaging and histopathological find-ings such that the histopathology satisfactorily explains the imaging findings.\" 12,13 Discordance refers to occasions when a breast CNB dem-onstrates benign histology while the imaging findings indicate possible malignancy. Discordance indicates that further evaluation is required, with options including (1) repeating CNB, possibly with a larger gauge or vacuum-assisted device, (2) surgical excisional biopsy, or (3) clinical and imaging surveillance. 8,12 Failure to resolve discordance be- tween radiology and pathology results can lead to a delay in breast cancer di-agnosis. The specifics of radiologic- pathologic correlation should be pro-vided by the radiologist performing the biopsy, 12,13 and this is typically done by issuing a radiology-pathology addendum report that includes the histopathologic diagnosis and out-lines whether further investigation, follow-up, surgical excision, or multi - disciplinary review is recommended. For symptomatic patients, there should be correlation with the physi-cal examination findings, diagnostic breast imaging, and pathology 12 by the clinician who has ordered and reviewed the investigations. If the physical examination results remain suspicious for malignancy, but imag-ing and/or core needle biopsy results are benign, further investigations such as skin biopsy, surgical biopsy, repeat core needle biopsy, or further imaging are necessary to rule out malignancy. Borderline or high-risk lesions Concordance assessment also in-volves assessing the risk of undersam-pling, which refers to the possibility of missing a significant finding in the adjacent tissue that was not removed by the CNB. When there is a signifi-cant probability of undersampling, the lesion is regarded as a borderline or high-risk lesion. Surgical excision of the area is typically recommended for high-risk lesions found on CNB to rule out malignancy. The risk of undersampling varies by diagnosis and is affected by factors such as the number and size of CNB specimens taken, the size of the lesion, and the institution. 8,12 The high-risk lesions for which surgical excision is usually recommended are shown in Table 2 .

For image-detected abnormalities, speci - men imaging of fine-wire-guided ex-cisions is recommended and all breast surgical specimens should be oriented for the pathologist. In rare circum-stances, the lesion localized for sur - gery with palpation or wire placement is different from the lesion biopsied under imaging guidance, and this is suggested by discordance between preoperative CNB pathology and sur - gical pathology. The presence of the CNB scar in the tissue excised sug-gests accurate targeting, but scarring can also be present in adjacent tissue. Discordance between the surgical pathology and the preoperative diag-nosis indicates further investigations are required, usually further imaging, with possible repeat image-guided localization and surgical re-excision. Multidisciplinary review is recom-mended to guide management. Navigating the diagnostic system With the development of more op- tions for diagnostic breast imaging and the introduction of image-guided breast biopsy, patients may need to attend several appointments to com - plete their imaging workup. It is rec-ommended that patients have their mammograms, breast ultrasound, and image-guided core needle biop-sies performed by a single radiology group to facilitate comparison, limit duplication of examinations, and de -crease wait times. When more spe-cialized biopsy or imaging techniques are required, such as stereotactic core biopsy or MRI-guided biopsy, the patient may be referred to a differ - ent facility as access to these servi-ces is not universally available. All relevant imaging and reports, as well as any pathology reports, should be forwarded when a patient is referred to a new facility. The potential for fragmented care and extended wait times has been recognized. 15,16 The 2012 Provincial Breast Health Strategy Summary Re-port 16 recommended a target wait time of 21 days to diagnosis without biop-sy and a wait time of 28 days to di - agnosis when biopsy is required. The report also recommended facilitating necessary investigations and increas-ing navigation resources for patients to achieve the goal of a prompt diag-nosis. The Screening Mammography Program of BC introduced fast track booking for evaluation of screen-detected lesions in 2010, 17 and many breast diagnostic teams in the prov-ince have introduced care pathways and dedicated breast health clinics in an attempt to reduce wait times. 18,19 Currently, each community has a slightly different system for arrang-ing breast imaging and biopsies. Ad-ditional investigations are facilitated either by radiology or by the ordering physician, depending on the centre. With so many different approaches and pathways, problems can arise, particularly if patients have mam- mograms outside of their usual com-munity or health authority. Referring physicians should be aware of these differences and the role they are ex-pected to play in arranging investiga - tions and follow-up for their patients. Summary Methodical evaluation of breast health concerns is essential to ensure completion of a thorough imaging and pathology assessment in an ap-propriate time frame. This allows for malignancy to be excluded and the patient returned to the care of the re-ferring physician, or for malignancy to be confirmed and definitive treat-ment arranged. The BI-RADS lexicon is needed to communicate the likeli-hood of malignancy in a standardized way, while concordance assessments between the clinical presentation, imaging results, and final pathology are crucial and should be employed Methodical evaluation of breast health concerns is essential to ensure completion of a thorough imaging and pathology assessment in an appropriate time frame.Current evaluation of breast health concerns and diagnosis of breast cancer32 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgthroughout the evaluation. Finally, because of slight variations in local practice, referring physicians should be aware of the role they play in help-ing patients navigate the diagnostic system.

ABSTRACT: The diagnosis of breast cancer has grown increasingly com-plex and delays can occur at mul-tiple points in the clinical process. In 2010 the Provincial Breast Health Strategy was developed to optimize the clinical pathway for breast can-cer diagnosis using a hub-and-spoke model for imaging and assessment. Each full-service diagnostic facility (hub) would provide imaging, ana - tomical pathology, surgical, and on-cology services, while the Screening Mammography Program, family phy-sicians, community imaging clinics, and hospitals (spokes) would refer women directly to the facility as needed. Hubs in each health author - ity would be required to meet the standard of care: core biopsy per - formed by a radiologist using image guidance and Breast Imaging Report-ing and Data System (BI-RADS) clas-sification and radiologic-pathologic correlation. The criteria for hubs would require having an accredited imaging department able to provide diagnostic ultrasound, wire localiza-tion, stereotactic biopsy, and other services using digital mammography equipment and related information systems. Hubs would also be expect-ed to provide services according to available guidelines and protocols, and to collect information required to measure performance and audit practice. Another initiative to im-prove breast cancer diagnosis has been the development of coordinat-ed care programs at Mount Saint Jo-seph Hospital and other institutions. Although these have been found to reduce wait times and be cost- effective, the lack of substantive permanent funding to support these programs has resulted in the loss of services at some centres and in-creasing wait times. To optimize pa-tient experience and minimize wait times, we recommend province-wide acceptance and implementa-tion of the Provincial Breast Health Strategy so that women navigating the diagnostic and therapeutic pro-cess receive coordinated care and support from a team of health care providers. As breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, the need for more breast imaging, diagnostic, and treatment services will likely increase as the population grows and ages. There have been multiple attempts over the past 25 years to improve the diagnostic process for women in British Colum-bia who present with breast symptoms or have an abnormal screening mam-mogram and require further imaging, surgical consultation or care, and onc-ology services. Currently, the major initiative for improving breast cancer prevention, screening, and diagnosis in BC is the Provincial Breast Health Strategy (PBHS). 1 Dr Wilson is the director of breast imaging at BC Cancer in Vancouver and a clinical associate professor in the Department of Radiology at UBC. Drs Kuusk, Dingee, and McKevitt are surgeons at Mount Saint Jo-seph Hospital. In addition, Dr McKevitt is a clinical associate professor in the Depart-ment of Surgery at UBC, Dr Dingee is a clinical assistant professor, and Dr Kuusk is a clinical professor. This article has been peer reviewed.34 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgCoordination of radiological and clinical care for breast cancer diagnosis in BC Provincial Breast Health Strategy In 2009 the Ministry of Health asked the Provincial Health Services Au - thority to devise a breast health ac - tion plan. This plan was completed in May 2010 and led to implementation of the Provincial Breast Health Strat - egy. 1 Objectives of the PBHS include developing a provincial clinical path-way that streamlines the process for women passing through the health care system by linking various diag-nostic steps and centres, and using a hub-and-spoke model to improve the delivery of breast health services in the province. After a review of provincial breast cancer screening policy was complet - ed in 2011, a strategy to reduce the number of surgical biopsies and in-crease the number of image-guided biopsies was implemented with some success. 2 A business case was made for converting from analog to digital mammography, and a plan was de-veloped to replace aging equipment. Cost-savings were obtained by using a provincial request for proposal and a single vendor. Once the last ana-log units are replaced in the North-ern Health region, the province-wide conversion to digital mammography will be complete. Following other PBHS recom - mendations, a number of radiologists have passed through the radiol - ogy fellowship training programs in breast imaging offered jointly by BC Women's Hospital and BC Can-cer, and cross-training programs for mammography and breast ultrasound technologists have resulted in the placement of a number of success-ful candidates around the province. In addition, partnerships with organ-izations such as the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation and the Canadian Cancer Society have permitted online communication of evidence-based messages to women and physicians regarding prevention and screening. 3 Health authority reports have been developed to provide HAs with im - portant performance indicators, such as time from abnormal screen to diag-nosis, and these continue to be shared to guide the evaluation process and promote shared accountability (writ-ten communication with Janette Sam, operations director, Screening Mam-mography Program of BC, 19 June 2017). Before the years 2009 to 2012, when the provincial clinical pathway and hub-and-spoke model for breast diagnostic and surgical services were operative and had the most influence, some successful models of a breast centre existed. The most successful has been the Diagnostic Breast Pro-gram at Victoria General Hospital, which began in 1995. This centre has provided women with same-day diag-nostic and biopsy services for over 20 years (written communication with Tammy Clark, supervisor, Breast Im-aging, Victoria General Hospital, 20 June 2017), and has meant the South Island health service delivery area has the shortest time from screening to diagnosis in the province. 4 Other examples of successful programs in-clude the breast health clinic at the Jim Pattison Outpatient Unit in Sur - rey and the breast health clinic at the Abbotsford Regional Hospital and Cancer Centre. Historically, breast imaging, di- agnostic, and surgical services in the Vancouver area have been particular - ly fragmented. This has resulted from having a number of hospital-based fa-cilities and community imaging clin - ics (CICs) play important roles in the delivery of services. Each community has a unique combination of facilities for breast diagnosis with varying de-grees of integration between them. In Vancouver itself, breast imaging ser - vices are provided at BC Women's, Mount Saint Joseph Hospital (MSJ), and BC Cancer. In addition, two large CICs, Xray 505 (headed by Dr Linda Warren) and Greig Associates, also perform diagnostic breast imaging services and image-guided biopsy, and host large breast screening clin - ics for the Screening Mammography Program (SMP). BC Women's also has a smaller screening centre, as does MSJ. Other CICs provide diag-nostic services using mammography and breast ultrasound. Historically, breast imaging, diagnostic, and surgical services in the Vancouver area have been particularly fragmented.35 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgCoordination of radiological and clinical care for breast cancer diagnosis in BC MSJ, BC Women's, and BC Can- cer, as well as some of the CICs, carry out preoperative imaging for women requiring wire localizations prior to surgery. Breast cancer surgery is per - formed at MSJ and BC Cancer, as well as at Vancouver General Hospi-tal (VGH) and the University of Brit-ish Columbia Health Sciences Centre. Women may have a localization pro-cedure performed at one centre, such as BC Cancer, and then with the wire in situ have to transport themselves by driver or taxi to another centre, such as VGH, for their surgery. The chal-lenges when coordinating all of this diagnostic work, as well as the surgi-cal planning and treatment, are con-siderable. This fragmentation also leads to potential duplication of book-ings and services, which is inefficient and costly to the system. Northern Health has considerable challenges as well, although these are largely due to geography, small populations, and isolation. Women may have to travel long distances from home for their diagnostic tests and treatment and this often results in delays. 4 Provincial clinical pathway The provincial clinical pathway was developed to streamline the imaging, diagnostic, and surgical process, to prevent duplication, and to assist women and their family physicians as they progress through the system ( Figure 1 ). The pathway was de- veloped as part of the PBHS by a team of radiologists, surgeons, pathologists, medical and radiation oncologists, mammography technologists, admin-istrators, and representatives of the Ministry of Health, with input from family physicians and other medical and oncology specialists as needed. The pathway timelines and standards were based on international guidelines and a number of very successful pro-grams already operating in Europe. 5 Implementation of the clinical pathway was facilitated by the intro-duction of a fast track referral policy by the Screening Mammography Pro-gram in 2010. This requires facilities to perform and report on diagnostic imaging procedures within 14 days of receiving the referral. Such fast track referrals permit a timely diagnostic journey and do not require the refer - ring physician to orchestrate the pro-cess, although the physician is kept informed of the results and progress. The proposed time from abnormal screen or presentation with symp-toms to the diagnostic result was set at 21 days. 6 Women receiving a can - cer diagnosis are then to be seen by a multidisciplinary team of specialists, as needed, before beginning the thera-peutic journey.The hub-and-spoke model The clinical pathway developed by the PBHS is based on a hub-and-spoke model, with all the necessary diag-nostic services grouped or accessible so that further referrals and additional communication do not cause delays ( Figure 2 ). This means a full-service diagnostic facility (hub) provides anatomical pathology, surgical, and oncology services to women referred directly by the SMP, family physicians, community imaging clinics, and hos-pitals (spokes), that may have some, but not all, of the needed services (i.e., stereotactic core biopsies, breast MRI, and MRI-guided biopsies). It was anticipated that each HA would have three hubs. Some of these hubs would be virtual rather than physical entities, with different partners contributing services. Inter -Figure 1.

As well as satisfying these crite- ria and meeting the standard of care (image-guided core biopsy perform-ed by radiologists using BI-RADS classification and with radiologic- pathologic correlation), each hub was expected to have the ability to: Audit biopsy practice. Coordinate multidisciplinary rounds (in person or by videoconference). Coordinate scheduling, referrals, patient flow, database, etc. Provide patients using the pathway with navigation materials and an in-formation line for support. Communicate effectively with breast surgery, anatomical pathol-ogy, and BC Cancer or a hospital-based oncology program, and to do all this by direct link when not co-located with these services.

Collect information required to measure performance and audit practice. 7 Coordinated care benefits In 2009 the Rapid Access Breast Clinic (RABC) was opened at Mount Saint Joseph Hospital using Lower Mainland innovation funding and a pay-for-performance model. Pa-tients who presented with a breast abnormality or who had an abnormal screening mammogram at MSJ were referred to the clinic for diagnostic workup and surgery if appropriate. All investigations and appointments were coordinated by the clinic and no additional requisitions or referrals were necessary. Patients were exam-ined by the clinic physician after diag-nostic investigations and then seen to discuss correlation of the examina - tion, imaging, and biopsy results, and for referral to the surgeon if appro-priate. Clerical staff and nurse navi-gators helped to move patients along the clinical pathway under the super - vision of clinic physicians and radiol-ogists. In keeping with recommended guidelines, 80% of patients received a diagnosis within 21 calendar days of referral to the program. Reductions in wait times The effectiveness of a rapid access model of care on wait times was re-viewed by comparing patients seen at the MSJ clinic with patients in the traditional system, that is, patients who had breast investigations at other centres and were then seen in an MSJ surgeon's private office. Patients seen at the RABC at Mount Saint Joseph waited fewer days for surgical consultation compared with patients seen at other centres (33 vs 86 days, P < .0001), and this applied to both malignant diagnoses (36 vs 59 days, P = .007) and benign diagnoses (31 vs 95 days, P < .0001). 8 Furthermore, 13% of patients in the traditional system referred to a sur - geon with a benign or indeterminate diagnosis were diagnosed with breast cancer after a mean wait time of 84.2 days to see the surgeon. Of these pa-tients, 49% presenting with benign or indeterminate diagnoses would not have been referred on to the surgeon in the RABC. Of the patients seen at the RABC, 95% had their diagnostic studies at one centre (MSJ) and 5% had diagnos-tic studies at other centres. In contrast, only 61% of patients in the traditional system attended a single diagnostic centre, with 39% attending two to four diagnostic centers (P < .0001). Of the patients in the traditional system who had a diagnostic mammogram, ultra-sound, and ultrasound-guided core bi-opsy, 31.5% attended more than one diagnostic centre. In 2010 the Screening Mammog- raphy Program introduced fast track booking to expedite diagnostic test-ing following an abnormal screening mammogram. As well, many radiolo-gy facilities adopted a policy of com-pleting diagnostic workups without requiring new requisitions for each step. Following these advances, the effectiveness of the traditional sys-tem and the coordinated care model at MSJ were assessed again in 2012 and compared. A reduction was seen in overall wait times to surgical consul-Compared with patients seen at other centres, patients seen at the Rapid Access Breast Clinic waited fewer days for surgical consultation.Coordination of radiological and clinical care for breast cancer diagnosis in BC38 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgtation in the traditional system from 2009 (86 days) to 2012 (73 days), but the time for diagnosis for patients with cancer did not change signifi-cantly (59 vs 55 days). 9 The propor - tion of patients diagnosed with cancer following surgical consultation in the traditional system was reduced from 13% in 2009 to 8% in 2012. The coor - dinated care model at MSJ was robust over time, with a mean wait time to surgical consultation of 36 days, con- trasting with 73 days in the traditional system. The time from presentation to first diagnostic imaging test, from imaging to core biopsy, and from core biopsy to surgical consultation were all reduced in the coordinated care model. MSJ is not the only centre to have evaluated the impact of a coordinated care system. Baliski and colleagues 10 reviewed wait times to breast cancer diagnosis and surgery in 2011 in the Interior of BC. Previously, wait times in this region had exceeded targets. After the implementation of a nurse navigation program, wait times from first diagnostic imaging test to surgery were reduced from 59 to 48 days. The time from first diagnostic imaging to core biopsy and from pathological di-agnosis to surgery were also reduced with coordinated care. Cost savings Although the Rapid Access Breast Clinic was found to reduce diagnos-tic wait times, there were concerns about the costs of coordinated care, so these were reviewed and com-pared with costs in the traditional sys-tem. Constrained by a lack of privacy agreements to allow the data sharing necessary to determine actual care costs for patients in the traditional system, an approach to modeling the costs was developed. RABC costs were calculated by looking at clinic records for 2011 and identifying presenting complaints, the investigations conducted, and the number of visits to diagnostic imag - ing required to evaluate each breast problem. It was assumed that a visit to the patient's family physician had been needed to either start the diag-nostic workup or to refer the patient to the RABC. For traditional system costs, it was assumed that each investigation and diagnostic imaging visit had re-quired a return visit or call to the fam-ily physician to arrange the next step in the diagnostic workup or to ob-tain the results, as had been the case in 2009. The family physician costs were determined at the patient level using the age-appropriate MSP Gen-eral Practice in-office visit fees. Costs for RABC care were com- pared with the modeled costs for the traditional system, which were calcu - lated at the patient level for the first 42 weeks of 2011 and annualized. Findings from 2009 RABC patients were also modeled and further cost savings were calculated for reduced surgical consultations for benign dis-ease and reduced duplication of imag-ing costs (modeled using the cost of breast ultrasound, the least expensive investigation). The historical rate for open surgical biopsy in BC for pa-tients presenting with a breast lump at the time of the study was 27%, 2 with a cost of $1140 compared with $582 for an ultrasound-guided core biopsy, data that were used to determine cost savings related to the improved core biopsy rate. Costs for patient annualized physician visits were $49 554 for the RABC compared with $72 842 for the traditional system. RABC care per patient ranged from $29.79 to $44.67 compared with $29.79 to $238.32 for the traditional system. The annual cost savings in reduced surgical consults for these patients was $55 044, and the annual cost savings in decreased duplicate breast imaging was $42 037. The annual cost savings from in - creasing the rate of image-guided bi-opsy was $153 000 in MSP costs and $176 000 in hospital costs. The total annual cost savings from the coor - dinated care model for patients seen at the RABC in 2011 was $448 368, which translates to a saving of $205 per patient. Further improvements needed In the past 5 years we have seen some clinics using the hub criteria, but the adoption of the hub-and-spoke model has been hampered by the lack of sub-stantive permanent funding, which has resulted in the loss of services at Although the Rapid Access Breast Clinic was found to reduce diagnostic wait times, there were concerns about the costs of coordinated care, so these were reviewed and compared with costs in the traditional system.Coordination of radiological and clinical care for breast cancer diagnosis in BC39 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgsome centres when temporary fund- ing has dwindled or disappeared. For example, the pay-for-performance funding model that the MSJ breast clinic operated on was discontinued in 2013 11 and funding for nurse navi- gators in Kelowna was lost with budget cuts (written communication with Chris Baliski, surgical oncolo-gist, BC Cancer Southern Interior, 4 June 2017). Although some communication improvement has occurred between sites performing diagnostic proce-dures and those performing surgery, this is largely due to interest in best practice by the personnel at these sites. There has been no funding to improve data collection or communi-cation during what has been the very slow rollout of the new Clinical and Systems Transformation (CST) infor - mation system. While in Canada the goal has been to provide 90% of women with a de-finitive diagnosis based on tissue bi-opsy within 7 weeks, 1 this has not yet been achieved in BC. The most recent figures from the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer (CPAC) for breast di-agnostic wait times are from 2013 12 and show that 66% of BC women needing a core biopsy after an ab-normal screening mammogram had the procedure within 7 weeks, while an SMP annual report including data from 2015 13 shows that 58% of BC women had a tissue biopsy within 7 weeks of an abnormal screening mammogram. Over the past 5 years many Ca- nadian provinces have implemented care pathways and navigation pro-grams for breast diagnostics in order to meet more ambitious target wait times of 21 to 30 days from presen-tation to diagnosis. If there is no fur - ther improvement in BC, particularly regarding communication and navi-gation, our wait times for diagnostic biopsies and surgery will continue to rise well beyond what is acceptable to patients and beyond the requirements of national and international guide - lines. Coordination of radiological and clinical care is needed to optimize patient experience and minimize wait times for breast cancer diagnosis. We recommend province-wide acceptance and implementation of the PBHS so that women receive co-ordinated diagnostic and therapeutic care from a team of health care pro-viders that includes medical office assistants, nurses, mammography technologists, family physicians, ra-diologists, surgeons, and medical and radiation oncologists Acknowledgments The authors would like to acknowledge the work of teams contributing to the Provincial Breast Health Strategy, particularly the Clinical Pathway Team.

Blood, MD, PhD, Mary McCullum, RN, MSN, CON(C), Wilson, MD, FRCPC, Rona Cheifetz, MEd, FRCSC, FACS Hereditary breast cancer in British Columbia: Outcomes from BC Cancer's High-Risk Clinic Evidence-based management of women at increased risk for breast cancer has resulted in early diagnosis of tumors and preventive surgery rates comparable to those in the literature. ABSTRACT Background: The majority of breast cancers are thought to occur sporadi-cally, with approximately 5% thought to be due to inherited susceptibility to cancer. The most commonly mu-tated genes predisposing women to breast cancer are BRCA1 and BRCA2. The Hereditary High-Risk Clinic at BC Cancer organizes breast screening and provides assessment and management recommendations for women with hereditary breast cancer risk. A study was done to as-certain the effectiveness of the clin-ic and identify areas of need. Methods: A retrospective chart re - view was conducted using BC Can- cer data for all patients seen at the High-Risk Clinic from 1997 to 31 July 2015. Study subjects included women with confirmed gene muta-tions that predispose them to in-creased risk for breast cancer and women who were untested but had a first-degree relative with a con-firmed mutation. Patient data were anonymized prior to analysis.Results: The study population in- cluded 654 women first seen in the clinic at a mean age of 42 years. Of these, 151 patients had previous di-agnoses for cancer, including 142 breast cancers. During management of these women at the clinic, a total of 80 new breast tumors were iden-tified and 77 of these were found to be malignant. Diagnosis occurred at a mean age of 48 years. The major - ity of new cancers were identified by either MRI or mammographic screening. During the study period, 38% of patients underwent prophy-lactic mastectomy and over 80% of patients older than 40 completed bi-lateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The mean age of patients undergoing bilateral mastectomy was 45 (22 to 79) years, while the mean age of pa-tients undergoing bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy was 47 (26 to 77) years. Discussion: Women with genetic risk for breast cancer require enhanced screening that includes annual MRI and mammography. The High-Risk Clinic is providing hereditary high risk women in BC with diagnostic and prophylactic services, and achieving rates of risk-reducing surgery com-parable to those in the literature. However, 53% of women attending the clinic were older than 40 at their first visit and so may have missed the full benefit of risk reduction that might be achieved with earlier re-ferral. In future, the centralization of care in the High-Risk Clinic and ongoing data collection should pro-vide an opportunity to evaluate new imaging modalities, long-term out-comes of risk-reducing surgery, and new risk-reducing strategies.

The lifetime breast cancer risk for a BRCA1 mutation carrier is 47% to 66% and for a BRCA2 mutation carrier is 40% to 57%. 3 The ovarian cancer risk is also greatly increased in BRCA muta- tion carriers: 23% for BRCA2 carriers, 3 compared with a 1% to 2% lifetime risk for ovarian cancer in the general population. 1 The Hereditary Cancer Program (HCP) at BC Cancer accepts physi - cian or self-referrals for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer assessment. Referral criteria for the HCP are shown in the accompanying Figure .4 Through the Hereditary Cancer Program, women receive a genetic risk assessment for cancer with ex-tended counseling and options for genetic testing. These services have been shown to improve understand-ing of breast cancer risk, increase knowledge of breast cancer and ge - netics, and help reduce patient stress. 5 Women who have an increased risk of breast cancer due to inheri-tance of a mutation in a breast can - cer susceptibility gene or who have a first-degree relative with a confirmed mutation are eligible for referral to the High-Risk Clinic at the BC Cancer Vancouver Centre. The clinic is run by a nurse practitioner and a medical director who arrange regular breast screening and provide consistent and up-to-date recommendations on risk-reducing measures. Evidence-based recommendations for this population include yearly breast magnetic resonance imag-ing from age 25 to 65 and yearly mammography from age 30. Risk- reduction measures include bilat-eral mastectomy, bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy (BSO) by age 40, and the use of risk-reducing medications. 6 A review was done to evaluate the outcomes for women seen in consul-tation and followed at the High-Risk Clinic to ascertain the effectiveness of the clinic and identify areas of need. Methods Data were obtained from BC Cancer charts of patients first seen at the High-Figure. Hereditary Cancer Program referral criteria for hereditary breast* and/or ovarian cancer.

Risk Clinic from its opening in 1997 to 31 July 2015. The study popula - tion included patients with confirmed gene mutations that predispose them to increased risk for breast cancer and patients who were untested but had a first-degree relative with a confirmed mutation. Upon referral to the clinic these patients were not under the care of an oncologist, had not completed bilateral mastectomy, and were able to attend appointments in Vancouver. Data from incomplete charts were in-cluded in the study. Patient data were anonymized prior to analysis and the study was approved by the UBC BC Cancer Research Ethics Board.42 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgHereditary breast cancer in British Columbia: Outcomes from BC Cancer's High-Risk Clinic Results The study population consisted of 654 women who were first seen in the clin-ic at a mean age of 42 years (range 18 to 83 years). Almost half (47%) of the women were younger than age 40 at their first visit. Personal BRCA muta- tions or BRCA mutation in a first- degree relative accounted for 98% of the study population, with the remain-ing 2% having a personal risk or fam-ilial presence of other gene mutations (TP53, ATM , CDH1) that increase risk for breast cancer, as presented in Table 1 . To date, 358 women (55%) have been discharged from the clinic. Of the women discharged, 175 (49%) were discharged due to the comple-tion of risk-reducing surgeries, 86 (24%) due to a new cancer diagno-ses and transfer to oncologic care, and 16 (4%) due to negative genetic testing results for a familial mutation. The remainder were discharged from the clinic for other reasons (e.g., pa - tient older than 65 years, patient lost to follow-up, patient provided with prophylactic surgical plans, patient moved out of province). Previous cancer diagnoses The number and pathology of pre-vious cancers in BRCA patients are presented in Table 2 . Of the 627 con-firmed BRCA mutation carriers, 156 (24%) had a previous cancer diagno-sis. Of these, 129 patients had previ-ously been diagnosed with a single cancer, 18 with two cancers (includ-ing 16 women with bilateral breast cancer), and 4 with three cancers. Previous breast cancers occurred at a mean age of 45 (27 to 71) years. In addition to the cancers in BRCA patients, five previous cancers were identified in carriers of other gene mutations (TP53, ATM , and CDH1). These included diagnoses of gastric cancer, sarcoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. New cancer diagnoses While the 654 patients in the study were being followed by the High-Risk Clinic, 116 new tumors were identified in 106 patients (16%). A total of 80 new breast tumors (77 of them malignant) were identified, with the majority being detected by MRI or mammography. Breast cancers ac-counted for 68% of new cancers and ovarian or fallopian cancers for 16%. The remaining 16% of new cancers included two peritoneal cancers (after prophylactic BSO), three pancreatic cancers, and ten other cancers. The mean age of patients diagnosed with new breast tumors was 48 (25 to 74) years. The distribution of new breast tumors by mutation type is presented in Table 3 . A previous history of cancer was present in 30% of these patients, and of these 78% had a pre-vious diagnosis of breast cancer. The methods used to detect new tumors and the time since the last normal screening results (obtained by MRI, mammography, or clinical ex-amination) are presented in Table 4 . The method of tumor detection was defined as the means by which an abnormality was reported before fur - ther investigations led to a cancer diagnosis. Risk-reducing surgeries Bilateral mastectomies have been completed for 246 of 654 patients at-tending the High-Risk Clinic (38%). Of these, 157 bilateral mastectomies (64%) and 78 contralateral - mies (32%) were done for prophyl - actic purposes. The indications for these mastectomies are presented in Table 5 . The mean age of patients under - going bilateral mastectomy was 45 (22 to 79) years. More than 80% of patients older than 40 with BRCA mutations have had bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at a mean age of 47 (26 to 77) years.

Of 100 patients who were younger than 40 when first seen in the High-Risk Clinic, 50 (50%) had prophylactic BSO by age 40. At the time of this review, 204 active clinic patients are younger than 40, and 31 of these (15%) have already had pro-phylactic BSO. Bilateral salpingectomy alone has been completed in 13 of 643 pa-tients (2%) with a personal or familial BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, with a plan for completion of oophorectomy at a later date. The mean age for bi-lateral salpingectomy is 35 (29 to 42) years. Discussion Women with genetic risk for breast cancer require enhanced screening that includes annual MRI and mam - mography. Multiple international studies have investigated the addi-tional cancer detection yield when screening MRI and mammography are combined for women with an elevated breast cancer risk. 7-11 The sensitivity of MRI (77% to 93%) was found to be much higher than the sensitivity of mammography (33% to 50%), although with a slightly lower specificity (81% to 99% for MRI vs 93% to100% for mammography). At the High-Risk Clinic, annual MRI is available from age 25 with the addi-tion of mammography at age 30. Compared with strategies that initiate imaging at other ages, this screening strategy has been shown by computer modeling to increase life expectancy and decrease breast cancer mortal - ity. 12 Traditionally, the majority of women in the High-Risk Clinic were followed with alternating MRI and mammogram every 6 months because while the initial studies of breast MRI involved concurrent procedures, the Mutation Number of patientsMean age (range) in yearsNumber of tumorsInvasive cancer Ductal carcinoma in situ Other high-risk lesions* BRCA1 38 47 (28-74) 41 30 9 2 BRCA2 30 49 (35-68) 34 24 9 1 Other genes 5 40 (25-64) 5 3 2 0 Totals 73 48 (25-74) 80 57 20 3 *Atypical ductal hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ, intraductal papillomata Table 3.

Indications for 246 mastectomies.44 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgmore frequent imaging assessment was thought to reassure patients. How-ever, no scientific evidence has been found to support a diagnostic benefit for this schedule, and more recently the clinic has adopted concurrent annual imaging with MRI and mam-mogram, since mammograms are often required for investigation of abnormalities identified on MRI and because concurrent imaging sim-plifies scheduling for out-of-town patients. 9,13 Diagnoses We cannot directly compare the per - formance of MRI and mammography as the screens were not performed concurrently during the entire study period. Of the tumors found during regular screening with imaging, 28% were either interval cancers or inci-dental findings on prophylactic mas-tectomy, usually within 1 year of the last normal screen. This speaks to the rapid growth of breast cancers in these high-risk patients and the need to in-vestigate any new palpable abnormal - ities, regardless of normal findings on recent imaging. As well, high-risk pa-tients need to be counseled that new cancers can develop quickly. Considering both the 142 breast cancers diagnosed in BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers prior to beginning surveillance at the High-Risk Clinic and the 80 breast tumors diagnosed in the clinic, a total of 222 breast tu-mors were diagnosed in 181 women followed at the clinic during the study period. The mean age of breast cancer diagnosis in women with a hereditary risk is lower than in women without such risk. The mean age of these patients at diagnosis was 46 years and the major - ity (62%) were women age 30 to 49. By contrast, in the general population the majority of breast cancers (51%) occur in women age 50 to 69 and only 18% occur in women younger than 50. 1 Early referral of women at risk based on their personal or family his-tory is essential in order to provide them with appropriate care in a timely fashion. More than half of the women at the High-Risk Clinic (53%) were older than 40 at their first visit and may have missed the full potential benefit of early risk-reducing surgery. This suggests that further research is needed to identify barriers to early identification of patients at risk. Prophylaxis Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy reduces the risk of breast cancer in women with a BRCA gene mutation by 90% to 95%. 14-16 Despite the risk reduction possible with prophylac-tic mastectomy, many women opt instead for radiologic surveillance. 14 Women choosing surveillance rather than prophylactic mastectomy are influenced by many psychological, medical, and demographic factors. 17 In our study, 24% of patients opted for bilateral mastectomies for purely prophylactic purposes. This is com-parable to findings by Friebel and colleagues, 18 who report a 22% rate of risk-reducing mastectomy, although not as high as the findings of Chai and colleagues, 19 who report a 46% rate of risk-reducing mastectomy by age 70. The risk of developing a contra- lateral breast cancer is significantly increased for mutation carriers with a history of breast cancer. 20 This infor - mation has been shown to influence a woman's surgical decision regard-ing breast cancer treatment, with in-creased rates of bilateral mastectomy at the time of initial surgical treat - ment. 21 Given the high risk in this patient population, such treatment is appropriate. In our study, one-third of the bilateral mastectomies involved removal of one breast for cancer treat - ment and the other for prophylactic purposes. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is recommended for BRCA mutation carriers primarily for reducing ovar - ian cancer risk. The reported rate of risk reduction for ovarian, fallopian, and peritoneal cancers achieved by prophylactic BSO is 80% to 96%. 22-24 The effect of prophylactic BSO on reducing breast cancer risk when the procedure is performed before natu-ral menopause is still being investi-gated, but it may reduce the risk of breast cancer by up to 50%. In the lit - erature, the reported rate of uptake for risk-reducing BSO in BRCA carriers is higher than that for bilateral mas - tectomy, with rates of approximately 45% in women younger than age 40 and up to 86% for women older than 40. 18,19 In our clinic population, 50% of patients who were seen before age 40 had prophylactic BSO by age 40, with more than 80% older than 40 having had BSO. The fallopian tube epithelium is Women with genetic risk for breast cancer require enhanced screening that includes annual MRI and mammography.Hereditary breast cancer in British Columbia: Outcomes from BC Cancer's High-Risk Clinic45 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgbelieved to be the site of origin for most ovarian cancers.25 Data from studies of patients who had under - gone tubal ligations for fertility con-trol have shown a subsequent risk reduction in ovarian cancer occur - rence for both members of the general population and BRCA mutation carri-ers. 26 For these reasons, consultation with young premenopausal patients in the High-Risk Clinic includes discus-sion of bilateral salpingectomy and oophorectomy for ovarian cancer risk reduction, with delayed oophorecto - my as an option for those not yet pre-pared to proceed to oophorectomy. 27 There is no evidence that this proce-dure impacts breast cancer risk, and the efficacy of salpingectomy alone as a risk-reduction measure for ovarian cancer is still to be defined. Bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy remains our primary risk-reduction recommenda-tion for ovarian cancer. Risk reduction Our data indicate that we are achiev-ing risk-reduction surgery rates for both prophylactic mastectomy and prophylactic BSO that are compar - able to those in the literature. Given the complexity of factors influencing a woman's decision regarding pro-phylactic surgery, further research is needed to determine whether it is possible to increase the uptake of preventive breast surgery. As well, a more in-depth exploration of patient understanding of the risks and bene-fits of breast surveillance versus sur - gery is needed and research in this area is planned. To our knowledge this is the third published report on a screening pro - gram for high-risk women and the second to report on a clinic designed to meet the needs of women at high risk for breast cancer. In 2012, Chi - arelli and colleagues reported on the results from the first year of the On -tario high-risk breast screening pro-gram, 28 which provides annual MRI with digital mammography in 28 cen-tres around the province. Before this, a preliminary report was published by Chart and colleagues in 1997 on outcomes from the Familial Breast Cancer Clinic at Sunnybrook Region-al Cancer Centre in Toronto. 29 Study limitations This study is based on medical in-formation from BC Cancer charts and only considers data for patients seen at the High-Risk Clinic. There are patients in the Hereditary Cancer Program who have chosen not to be followed by the clinic, and we do not have data on their outcomes. The lo-cation of the clinic at the BC Cancer Vancouver Centre is a limiting fac - tor for assessment for some patients, and in the past year we have been developing an expanded model with teleconsultation options. Access to breast MRI throughout the province continues to pose a challenge for a distributed model of care. In future, the centralization of care in the High-Risk Clinic and ongo-ing data collection should provide an opportunity to evaluate imaging out-comes and new imaging modalities, long-term outcomes of risk-reducing surgery, and new risk-reducing strategies. Conclusion The Hereditary Cancer Program and the High-Risk Clinic at BC Can - cer provide important services for women with an inherited predispos-ition for and increased lifetime risk of breast cancer. This study shows that British Columbian women with an in-creased risk of breast cancer are able to receive evidence-based screening and management through the High-Risk Clinic. The clinic is achieving risk-reduction surgery rates for both prophylactic mastectomy and pro-phylactic bilateral salpingo-oophor - ectomy that are comparable to those in the literature. The clinic also pro - vides opportunities for future research that may enhance the uptake of risk-reducing surgery and identify barriers to early identification of patients at risk. More than 50% of women are older than 40 when first seen at the clinic and may not be receiving the full risk-reducing benefit of early re-ferral and intervention. Competing interests None declared.

Cadenhead, BKin, Brennan Eadie, MD, FRCSC Sport-related ocular trauma in Vancouver, British Columbia: Not the usual suspects A remarkably high rate of badminton-induced eye injury was found in a retrospective chart review. ABSTRACT Background: Vision loss due to eye injury has a significant effect on quality of life. In the US, trauma to the ocular structures is one of the most common causes of blindness, second only to cataracts, and 15% of these injuries occur during baseball, basketball, racquetball, football, and soccer activities. A study was pro - posed to establish the chief sport-ing causes of traumatic eye injury in Vancouver, BC, and to determine if individuals could be encouraged to use eye protection for high-risk sports. Methods: The study was conducted using data for patients with ocular trauma referred to the Vancouver General Hospital Eye Care Centre in 2013. Sport-related cases were identified in a retrospective chart review and follow-up visits were arranged. Patient characteristics, cause of injury, visual function, and ocular diagnosis were analyzed. A subgroup of patients was surveyed to assess their attitudes toward the use of eye protection.Results: Of 1301 charts reviewed, 58 were found to describe sport-re-lated traumatic eye injuries (4.45%) sustained in 23 activities. The most common sports leading to injury were soccer and badminton. The majority of patients with badminton-induced injuries felt that eye pro-tection would have prevented their injuries, yet only a minority agreed that the use of eye protection for the sport should be encouraged. Conclusions: Soccer and badmin- ton were the chief causes of sport- related injury seen at the Vancouver General Hospital Eye Care Centre in 2013. All badminton-induced inju-ries resulted in traumatic hyphema. Primary care physicians should be confident in managing minor ocu-lar trauma but be aware of potential complications and not hesitate to contact an ophthalmologist should they have concerns. Mandating eye protection for youth, normalizing the use of protective eyewear, and edu-cating those participating in high-risk sporting activities should be considered to reduce ocular trauma. Background Vision loss resulting from traumatic eye injury has a significant effect on quality of life in the developed world. 1 Trauma to the ocular structures is one of the most common causes of blind-ness in the US, second only to cata - racts, and 15% of these injuries occur during sporting activities. 1 The most common activities related to traumat - ic eye injury in the US are baseball, basketball, racquetball, football, and soccer. 1 Our clinical experience in Van- couver, BC, suggests that US sport-related injury findings do not apply to our patient population. A Canadian study found that the three most com-mon locations for ocular injuries were the home, the workplace, and sport-ing activity sites. 2 While Canada has Ms Cadenhead is a fourth-year medical student at the University of British Co-lumbia.

This article has been peer reviewed.48 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgSport-related ocular trauma in Vancouver, British Columbia: Not the usual suspects a similar proportion of sport-related eye injuries (8.6% of all traumatic eye injuries), it is unclear which sports are primarily responible. 2 Reports of pre- vious studies have not provided de-tails about type of sporting activity, presence of eye protection, type of eye protection used, if any, and atti - tudes toward eye protection. 2 Further research in this area could have im-portant implications for injury pre-vention in Canada. Moreover, this is of particular concern in British Co-lumbia, a province ranking in the top three for number of eye injury inci -dents based on recent survey results. 2 We hypothesized that the unique demographics of Vancouver would mean some sports not identified in US studies are the primary cause of trau-matic eye injuries. Our goal was to es-tablish the chief sport-related causes of traumatic eye injury at our hos-pital, and to determine which sports participants were amenable to using eye protection. Methods Charts were reviewed for patients vis-iting the Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) Eye Care Centre from 1 Janu-ary 2013 to 31 December 2013. All charts describing sport-related trau - matic eye injury were identified and patients were contacted for follow-up. Data collected and analyzed in- cluded patient age, sex, community of residence, ethnicity, and cause of in-jury (i.e., sport played). Visual func-tion was assessed at each patient's follow-up visit to determine second-ary complications related to hyphema, the accumulation of blood in the ante - rior chamber. Examination results for the affected eye versus the unaffected eye were compared for best corrected visual acuity (BCV A) and intraocular pressure (IOP) using paired sampled t tests. Significance was set at an alpha value of .05. Six binary questions were an- swered by patients with badminton injuries to assess their attitude toward eye protection. The principles of the Declaration of Helsinki were followed when de -signing and executing the study. Ethics approval was granted by the University of British Columbia's Clinical Research Ethics Board. Results Of 1301 charts reviewed, 58 described sport-related traumatic eye injuries (4.45%). The mean age of injured pa-tients was 29.8 (SD 14.8) years. The youngest patient was 5 years old and the oldest was 64 years old. The male to female ratio was 2.1 to 1.0. The ma-jority of injuries (35 of 58) occurred in the summer months. Twenty-three sporting activities were identified and three or more inju-ries occurred in seven activities: soc - cer, badminton, cycling, squash, ball hockey, baseball, and rugby ( Table 1 ). Soccer was the sport most commonly associated with eye trauma at the VGH Eye Care Centre in 2013, followed by badminton. Together these activities accounted for one-third of all ocular trauma seen at the centre. Traumatic hyphema was seen in all nine patients with badminton-induced injuries, and three of the nine patients had intraocu-lar pressure rise. One had commotio retinae and vitreous hemorrhage and one had cystoid macular edema. Of the nine patients with bad- minton-induced traumatic eye injury, most had evidence of angle recession on gonioscopy. Moreover, we ob-served a statistical impairment in both best corrected visual acuity (P = .027) and intraocular pressure (P = .011) in the affected eye compared with the unaffected eye ( Table 2 ).

The majority be-lieved eye protection could have prevented their injuries, yet only a minority agreed that the use of eye protection for the sport should be encouraged. Conclusions Results of this retrospective chart re-view suggest that the sports associated with ocular trauma in the Vancouver area differ from those reported in the US, 1 and that badminton is under - recognized as an activity associated with significant intraocular injury. In 2013 badminton caused 15% of all sport-related traumatic eye in-juries at the VGH Eye Care Centre and led to hyphema in 100% of cases. Other investigations have not iden-tified badminton as a cause of trau-matic eye injury, which may be due to the differences in sporting inter - ests seen in Vancouver's ethnically diverse population. 1 The 2011 cen- sus found that approximately 40.1% of the population in Vancouver spoke a nonofficial language (i.e., not Eng-lish or French) at home. 3 Badmin- ton is a popular sport in Vancouver's large Asian community and three of the five survey respondents were of Asian ethnicity. Unlike squash, a sim-ilar racquet sport, badminton does not require the use of eye protection. Understanding the risks posed by activities such as badminton and knowing more about the pathophys-iology of ocular trauma and how to prevent and manage eye inju-ries can reduce vision loss and other complications. Pathophysiology of ocular trauma Trauma to the eye can range from adnexal abrasions and lacerations to blunt and penetrating orbital injury. Ocular trauma from sport is often the result of a blunt force that results in hyphema. 4 Although hyphemas are most commonly caused by trauma, they can also be caused by postopera-tive complications, iris neovascular - ization, melanoma, leukemia, and juvenile xanthogranuloma. 4 Traumatic hyphemas occur when a blunt force indents and stretches the globe, resulting in architecture disruption and increased intraocular pressure. This intraocular pressure causes a posterior displacement of the lens-iris diaphragm and bleed-ing from disruption of the highly vascularized ciliary body and iris. 4 Although hyphema is usually a self-limiting condition, significant ocular trauma requires referral to an ophthal - mologist for management and follow-up of secondary complications such as chronic elevation of intraocular pressure, blood deposition in the cor - nea, peripheral anterior synechiae, posterior synechiae, cataracts, and optic nerve damage. 5,6 Other poste- rior segment injuries that may occur as a result of trauma to the globe are commotio retinae, traumatic macu-lar hole, choroidal rupture, vitreous hemorrhage, and traumatic retinal detachment or retinal dialysis. 7 These sequelae may ultimately result in re-duced visual acuity or, in severe cas-es, blindness. Injury prevention Eye protection in sport is widespread and has a long history. Around 1200 BC the first use of a protective face mask for fencing was documented by the Egyptians. 8 Since then, many forms of eye protection have de-veloped, including visors, goggles, and sunglasses. In many Olympic sports, eye protection is mandated to protect competitors from both exter - nal injuries such as corneal abrasion and internal injuries such as retinal detachment. 8 Some sporting organiz - ations have mandated eye protection; examples include baseball catcher's masks, hockey visors, football visors, and squash goggles. 8 On 1 January 2012, US Squash, the national gov - erning body for the sport, required protective eyewear to be worn during all events accredited by US Squash. 8,9 Squash is the first racquet sport to implement strict rules and regula - tions for eye protection. This was an instrumental move in the US and has reduced the number of sport-related ocular injuries. 1,2 Further, US Squash requires that eyewear meet the current In 2013 badminton caused 15% of all sport-related traumatic eye injuries at the VGH Eye Care Centre and led to hyphema in 100% of cases.50 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgSport-related ocular trauma in Vancouver, British Columbia: Not the usual suspects ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) standards, a significant step ahead of what Canada has done regarding eye protection regulations. 9 There is much room for improve - ment when it comes to eye protection for both soccer and badminton. Ac-tion needs to be taken on the interna-tional, national, and regional levels. At the international level, the Olym-pics can make eye protection manda-tory. At the national level, governing bodies can require anyone using pub-lic facilities to wear eye protection. At the regional level, school boards and clubs can require all children compet-ing in tournaments to wear eye pro - tection. Moreover, individual coaches and parents can educate youth about eye protection benefits, including im-proved sport performance and pre-vention of vision loss. With children, the short-term benefits should be em-phasized and the use of eye protection should be normalized to achieve high-er adherence rates. Reaching athletes at the beginning of their sporting ca-reers is likely to have the most long-term impact. Historically, prevention of injuries has been the key to reduc-ing ocular trauma in sport and much can still be done in this regard. Injury management In primary care it is important to identify those patients who can be managed by general practitioners and those who should be referred to a specialist. This is particularly dif-ficult if loss of vision is possible, as primary care physicians would rather err on the side of caution and make a referral. In cases of ocular trauma it is imperative to do a primary survey, obtain a thorough history, and com-plete a physical examination of the eye and surrounding ocular adnexa. History taking should focus on per - tinent details regarding the mechan-ism of the traumatic event (blunt vs penetrating, monocular vs binocular), any vision loss (central vs peripheral), pain, visual distortion, or diplopia, and past instances of poor vision or other significant disorders (e.g., co-agulopathies). The physical examina-tion should include an assessment of visual acuity, external adnexa, ocular motility, and pupillary reaction, as well as confrontational field testing and fundoscopy. Medications such as anesthetic eye drops (e.g., tetra-caine 0.5%) and cycloplegics (e.g., cyclopentolate 0.5%) for paralysis of the ciliary muscle may be needed for the physical examination, as patients with ocular trauma can be in signifi-cant pain and unable to cooperate. Fluorescein eye stain should be used to evaluate for corneal abrasions. My-driatics (e.g., tropicamide 0.5%) can be used to facilitate fundoscopy, but should be avoided if there is a shal - low anterior chamber or if the patient is under neurological observation. 10 Ocular trauma typically requires that therapy be instituted within a few hours. 10 Urgent referral (i.e., an oph- thalmologist should be seen at once) is required for penetrating injuries of the globe, embedded conjunctival or corneal foreign bodies, hyphema, and traumatic optic neuropathy (usually in the context of cranial or maxillo-facial trauma). 10 Semi-urgent referral (i.e., an ophthalmologist should be seen in 1 to 2 days) is indicated for orbital fractures and subconjunctival hemorrhage in the context of blunt trauma. 10 A thorough examination is required to ensure appropriate refer - ral. Primary care physicians should be confident in managing minor ocu-lar pathology but be aware of poten-tial complications and not hesitate to contact an ophthalmologist should they have concerns. Although there is limited evidence for managing uncomplicated traumat - ic hyphema, initial treatment should include conservative measures, rest, and eye protection. 11,12 Rest is the single most important step in the management of hyphema. Typically, patients with hyphema are prescribed bed rest for up to 10 days after ocu-lar trauma to prevent rebleeding and its serious consequences. 11,12 Medical management with steroids and a myd-riatic agent for analgesia is routinely recommended, although the evidence for this is not strong. 12 Retrospective studies suggest that 5% of patients with hyphema, on average, require surgery. Indications for surgical man-agement are secondary hemorrhage or pre-existing blood dyscrasia. 2 Typ- ically, patients return to their former visual acuity and function, but are at higher risk for several complications, namely glaucoma and early cataract formation. 13 In one study, at least 7% of those with anterior angle recession on examination developed chron-ic glaucoma after 1 year or more. 13 Thus, in cases of hyphema and other severe ocular sports injuries, yearly follow-up is imperative. The costs of these sequelae to the individual and the health care system are potentially preventable. Our data strongly sup-port conservative management and prevention of complications to reduce long-term ocular morbidity. Improving awareness of risk Our data and evidence from other case reports clearly demonstrate that bad-minton can be a dangerous sport, 14 yet there appears to be resistance to the use of protective eyewear. Only 40% of our survey respondents expressed willingness to use such equipment. Historically, participants in various sports have shown similar resist-ance. 15 However, once mandated in sports such as hockey and squash, eye protection has resulted in a significant reduction in injuries. 15 It is our belief that public health and sporting organ-51 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgSport-related ocular trauma in Vancouver, British Columbia: Not the usual suspects izations can work to reduce the num- ber of sport-related eye injuries and ultimately prevent the long-term se-quelae of eye trauma. Study limitations Our retrospective chart review iden-tified a relatively small number of subjects with ocular trauma. As well, the cases analyzed were from a subset of patients referred to the Eye Care Centre at VGH, a tertiary care facility, and thus do not rep-resent all the traumatic eye injury cases that occurred in Vancouver during the study period and were managed by emergency physicians at community hospitals or by pri-mary care physicians. Our study also failed to capture those patients with life- and vision-threatening injuries who required immediate surgical intervention and hospital admission for monitoring and resuscitation. As stated previously, Vancouver has a uniquely diverse population that may limit the generalizability of our find-ings. Moreover, the small number of eye injuries per sport limited our ability to obtain useful sport-specific survey data. Summary Trauma to the eye can range from adnexal abrasions and lacerations to blunt and penetrating orbital injury. Action regarding eye protection in sport needs to be taken on the inter - national, national, and regional levels. In cases of ocular trauma, it is im- perative for primary care physicians to do an initial survey, obtain a thor - ough history, and complete a physi-cal examination of the eye. Primary care physicians should be confident in managing minor ocular trauma but be aware of potential complications and not hesitate to contact an ophthalmol-ogist should they have concerns. The patients identified in our chart review experienced a remarkably high rate of badminton-induced traumatic eye injury, a finding that may be due to the unique demographics of Van-couver. 3 As several of these patients experienced severe complications, we recommend that protective eye-wear be worn by those participating in the sport. Strict rules and regulations for the use of protective eyewear in badminton would be in keeping with other racquet sports, such as squash. However, our results suggest that education will be needed since only a minority of injured badminton play-ers expressed any willingness to use protective eyewear. Mandating eye protection for youth, normalizing the use of pro-tective eyewear, and educating those participating in high-risk sports should be considered to reduce ocular trauma.

Along with predicted shortages of health care workers and fiscal constraints, meeting the qua-druple aim of health care (improved population health, better patient ex-perience, better provider experience, and reduced cost) for a growing se-nior population will necessarily rely increasingly on existing and emerging technologies. Technological advances in health care are abundant, ranging from ar - tificial intelligence, which will, for example, create patient-specific care plans based on multiple parameters, to virtual and augmented reality, which will allow trainees to learn procedures safely before having con-tact with patients. Tricorders for rapid bedside diagnostics and tailor-made drug regimens using gene sequencing to guide pharmacologic choices are other looming technologies. For improving elder care, technol - ogies can be broadly divided into four categories: managing patient data, disease self-management, monitoring patient-specific medical or risk fac-tors, and providing care to the patient. In the area of patient informa- tion, BC has one of the highest rates of electronic medical record (EMR) adoption in Canada, 1 and digital re - cords are improving clinical care and workflows as well as communication between doctor and patient/caregiver and among health care providers. The future holds improved communica-tions accessed from and stored with-in the EMR. EMRs may also be the repository of patients' health data as collected by various monitors. In terms of self-care, which for elders often means the \"circle of care,\" a growing number of apps are avail-able for smart phones and tablets that are user-friendly and provide useful information, as would a reference book. Apps can also monitor functions like sleep and heart rate and provide reminders to take medications. These apps are relatively passive and require a certain degree of patient (or care-giver) involvement. While seniors are increasingly computer savvy, 2 those with sensory, cognitive, or functional impairment may not themselves be able to use these technologies. Next is the realm of remote moni- toring, including electronic sensors and video surveillance. The so-called Internet of Things will offer a host of home-based sensors to track such things as activities and medication compliance. Seniors' homes may have device monitoring\u2014Is the fridge door being opened often enough? Are medications being popped out of blis-ter packs? Already available, Smart Blisters have an electrical current that is interrupted when the foil of a blis-ter is torn. To be effective, these sen-sors and video monitoring require that someone, either the patient or, more likely, an involved caregiver, is noti-fied when activities don't meet prede-termined thresholds. Since frail and demented elders are at high risk of falling and wandering, sensors in the floor and GPS trackers will be used to monitor seniors and notify caregivers of problematic events. These technol-ogies, in combination, may enhance the health and safety of seniors, but This article is the opinion of the Geriatrics and Palliative Care Committee, a sub-committee of Doctors of BC's Council on Health Promotion, and is not necessarily the opinion of Doctors of BC. This article has not been peer reviewed by the BCMJ Editorial Board.it will be at the cost of loss of privacy and autonomy. The ability for seniors to understand and consent to the use of such monitoring systems may also be questionable. Perhaps the most promising and, at the same time, ethically challeng-ing technologies involve patient care. So-called care robots are technologi-cal devices integrated into care prac-tices. They may offer indirect or direct care to patients and, in the latter, they may assist with physical care, like bathing, or be used more for psycho-social care such as companionship. It is argued that robots hold the promise of mitigating a shortage of health care workers and enhancing the autonomy of elders. 3 At the same time there are concerns that robots will diminish the moral quality and standard of care. 4 As assistive technology expands, so does the field of robo-ethics. Sharkey and Sharkey 5 highlight areas of con- cern in robotic elder care\u2014reduction in human contact, loss of privacy, loss of personal liberty, loss of control, deception, and objectification. This suggests that care benefits should be thoughtfully weighed against the ethical costs. \u2014Jay Slater, MD Geriatrics and Palliative Care Committee References 1. Collier R.

Compensation increase: Economic stability dividend Effective 1 February 2018, phys- icians will receive an across-the-board increase of 0.4% to all MSP fees, as well as to service, salary, and sessional contract ranges and rates within those ranges. This is in advance of the 0.5% annual gen-eral increase that will be applied on 1 April 2018, as negotiated in the 2014-2019 Physician Master Agree-ment (PMA). The Economic Stability Divi- dend shares the benefits of econom-ic growth between physicians and the province contingent on growth in BC's real gross domestic prod-uct (GDP). A Letter of Agreement in the PMA triggers additional in-creases for physicians when BC's real GDP exceeds the prediction of an independent panel of economists that advises the Ministry of Finance. Statistics Canada reported that the BC economy grew by 3.5% in 2016, exceeding the panel's forecast of 2.7%. There is one remaining op-portunity for the Economic Stabil-ity Dividend under the term of the 2014-2019 PMA.

Book review: Your Heart Is the Size of Your Fist By Martina Schol - tens, MD. Brindle & Glass Publish-ing, 2017. ISBN 978-1-927366-68-4. 224 pages. Your Heart Is the Size of Your Fist: A Doctor Re- flects on Ten Years at a Refugee Clinic is a captivating reflection of Dr Schol-tens' work at a Canadian refugee clin - ic, interwoven with stories from her personal life. The stories reflect her journey as a doctor caring for new-ly arrived refugees, their struggles with navigating the Canadian health care system, and the challenges faced when trying to practise cultural hu-mility in medicine. She also parallels her work as a physician to her person-al life as she talks about maintaining this delicate balance. Some of the highlights include following an Iraqi family as each member transitions to living in Cana-da, and how she plays a role in each of their medical journeys. When a young Congolese woman is diagnosed with HIV , the story provides insight into the blurring boundaries of medicine and spirituality. Several stories high-light what being a physician entails, including being a healer, advocate, and educator, and often going above and beyond for your patients. The writing is honest and power - ful, the details of each story recalled with care and understanding. Some stories make you laugh at times, while others call for reflection on what we take for granted, such as freedom, safety, and access to health care. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, especially from a primary-care point of view. I urge anyone interest-ed in primary care or refugee health, along with anyone who would like an honest view about providing cultur - ally sensitive health care, to give this book a read. \u2014Yvonne Sin, MD New tools to help achieve compliance with PIPA Creating a robust privacy manage- ment program can seem daunting, and putting such a program in place can sometimes take a back seat to providing patient care. Under current privacy legislation, physicians must maintain patient confidentiality, but must also be able to prove that they are doing so. Doctors of BC, in collaboration with the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner for BC and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of BC, has updated the BC Physician Privacy Toolkit: A guide for physi-cians in private practice, originally published in 2004 and subsequently updated in 2009 and now in 2017. Along with the updated guide, com - prehensive resources that physicians can rely on to meet their obligations under the Personal Information Pro-tection Act (PIPA) are now available in the online Privacy Toolkit. The Pri-vacy Toolkit includes: A PIPA fact sheet. A module devoted to each privacy principle and guideline. Numerous tips and checklists. Short videos (including one that guides users on navigation) that fo-cus on privacy principles and guide-lines, each 2 to 4 minutes long and accompanied by notes that include the points discussed. A consolidated video for employee orientation and annual refresher training. Searchable FAQs. Customizable forms and templates. The revised BC Physician Privacy Toolkit: A guide for physicians in pri-vate practice (concise and current). Privacy management programs can always be improved, so whether news a practice is well established or just starting, the Privacy Toolkit can help. The Toolkit is available on the Doc - tors of BC website at www.doctors ofbc.ca/resource-centre/physicians/managing-practice/privacy-toolkit.

Who would look after the kids? If you took time off to be with your spouse, could you manage with a lower income? How would your re-tirement plan hold up if you had to un-expectedly spend $200 000 to cover the costs of treatments, medications, travel, and home modifications? Critical illness insurance is a unique product that pays a lump sum if the insured is diagnosed with one of the covered illnesses. There are often 24 or 25 conditions covered in a critical illness policy. These condi-tions can include cancer, heart attack, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and benign brain tumors to name a few. Unlike disability insurance, you may apply for critical illness insurance whether or not you are actively working. For this reason, these policies can be a fantastic way to protect against the risk of a critical illness diagnosis for a spouse who is not actively work - ing outside the home. It is advisable to apply for these policies as early as possible since they can be difficult to qualify for, especially as people age. By insuring your spouse, you could answer some of the questions raised above\u2014you could hire a caregiver for your children, and afford to take time out of your practice to care for your spouse and take him or her to important appointments.

New resource for locums and physicians seeking locums: Locumunity One of the top reasons for physician burnout is the inability to find locum coverage. There is massive demand for locums, and although the percent - age of physicians who do locums has increased slightly, inefficient place-ment mechanisms make it difficult for physicians to connect with a broad base of locums. Dr Haneen Abu-Remaileh, a BC locum physician, created www .Locumunity.com to simplify the task of finding a locum position in Canada and eliminate the need to sift through multiple job-posting boards. Locumunity is a web-based plat- form that matches and connects clinics with locums using a unique matching algorithm to help stream-line the recruitment process, dissolve provincial barriers, and help efficient - ly redistribute locum coverage. It is the first centralized Canada-wide and specialty-wide search tool for locums and clinics.

Colon screening test for average-risk patients resumes in BC Fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), part of the early screening process for colon cancer, resumed on 15 De-cember 2017 following a temporary suspension. Eligible patients can pick up FIT kits from any public or private lab across the province with a referral from their health care provider. Testing was suspended in October 2017 after a manufacturer problem was identified with the reagent used to test the FIT samples. New batches of reagent have been approved for use following extensive testing and qual-ity assurance process. The Colon Screening Program, along with laboratory providers and health authority partners, has a coor - dinated plan to notify patients about the resumption of testing, first ad-dressing those patients for whom test-ing was delayed. Health care providers are advised that: Asymptomatic patients aged 50 to 74 can be referred for FIT using the Standard Outpatient Lab Requisi-tion every 2 years. Patients with existing FIT requisi-tions from their health care provider may bring their requisition to the laboratory to receive their FIT kit. Patients who could not pick up a FIT kit or those who completed FIT but did not receive a result due to the FIT suspension may be con-tacted by their laboratory provider. Each laboratory will determine the most appropriate approach for con-tacting their patients. Most labora - tories are considering giving notice with instructions to patients by mail or telephone. Every effort will be made to contact patients. FIT is a routine screening test rec- ommended for men and women be-tween the ages of 50 and 74. FIT is designed for people who do not have symptoms and are considered at av-erage risk of colon cancer. It detects blood in the stool, which can be an early sign of colon cancer. Those with abnormal test results are referred for a follow-up colonoscopy. Patients with a strong family his- tory of colon cancer or a personal his-tory of adenomas were not affected by the test suspension and continued to be referred directly to the Colon Screening Program for colonoscopy. Patients with symptoms that may in-dicate cancer were not affected by this test suspension. For more information regarding the Colon Screening Program, visit www.screeningbc.ca/colon. Universal, no-cost coverage for mifegymiso in BC Universal, no-cost coverage for the drug mifegymiso (also known as RU-486) commenced on 15 January 2018. Mifegymiso, an alternative to surgical abortion, is a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol. It can be used to terminate pregnancies at an early stage\u2014up to 9 weeks from the start of the last menstrual period. Since 11 July 2017, Pharmacare has covered mifegymiso subject to the rules of a person's Pharmacare plan. Patients under the Fair Pharmacare plan may face an out-of-pocket ex-pense. Currently, the out-of-pocket cost for mifegymiso for individuals without Pharmacare coverage is ap-proximately $300.

The guideline facilitates individual - ized assessment and provides a framework and tools to promote patient-centred strategies to manage frailty and prevent further functional decline. The primary focus of the guideline is the community-based primary care set-ting, although the tools and strategies included may be useful in other care contexts.Key recommendations Early identification and management of patients with frailty or who are vulnerable to frailty provides an op-portunity to suggest appropriate preventive and rehabil-itative actions (e.g., an exercise program, review of diet and nutrition, medication review) to be taken to slow, prevent, or even reverse decline associated with frailty. Use of a diligent case-finding approach to identify patients with frailty, particularly among older adults who regularly or increasingly require health and social services, is recommended. However, routine frailty screening of the general population of older adults is not recommended. Many patients with frailty can be assessed and man-aged in the primary care setting through a network of support, which may include family, caregivers, and community care providers. Coordinate care with other care providers and ensure patients and caregivers are referred to or connected with local health care and so-cial services. Polypharmacy is common in patients with frailty. Con-sider the benefits and harms of medications by con-ducting a medication review in all patients with frailty. Initiate advance care planning discussions for patients with frailty or vulnerable to frailty.

[Amended, 2017] Implement pharmacologic therapy in a stepwise ap-proach and use the lowest step that achieves optimal control based on the patient's severity of COPD. [New, 2017] Develop an exacerbation action plan with the patient for pharmacologic therapies including short-acting bronchodilators, oral corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Use routine follow-ups to evaluate the patient's inhaler technique and adherence regularly. Evaluating inhaler technique is particularly important in patients who are older, frail, or cognitively impaired.

Resources to prevent medical errors during transfer of care Medical errors can be costly for both patient and hospital. As defined by the Joint Commission (www.jointcom-mission.org/assets/1/18/Hot_Topics _Transitions_of_Care.pdf), in or - der to keep patients safe, clinicians should focus on the three key points along the patient's continuum of care. To help, free resources are available. Upon admission Patient admission is a critical time for risk assessment. Clinicians should employ screening tools to identify high-risk patients before procedures. For patients potentially receiving opi-oids, this can include the Risk Index for Serious Prescription Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression or Overdose (RIOSORD). Patient recovery As patients recover from procedures, it is common for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pumps to be em-ployed to manage pain. The Physician- Patient Alliance for Health & Safe-ty (PPAHS) PCA Safety Check-list is a free downloadable resource developed by a panel of experts to reduce the risk of opioid-related adverse events (www.ppahs.org/pca-safety-checklist-download). Patient discharge Clinicians should take steps to active - ly engage patients and their families as partners in their health. Patients are encouraged to ask the following five questions about their medications: 1. Have any medications been added, stopped, or changed, and why? 2. What medications do I need to keep taking, and why? 3. How do I take my medication, and for how long? 4. How will I know if my medication is working, and what side effects do I watch for? 5. Do I need any tests and when do I book my next visit? We encourage clinicians to down- load a PDF version of these five ques-tions and share it with their patients (www.ismp-canada.org/medrec/ 5questions.htm).

Medical student mistreatment ranges from verbal harassment and public humiliation to threats of lim-iting future career opportunities. In a national survey conducted by the As-sociation of Faculties of Medicine of Canada in 2017, 59.6% of medical students in their final year reported being personally mistreated. 2 In 2016 the rate was 53%; in 2015 it was 50.6%. 3 Of students reporting mis- treatment, 89.6% report mistreatment by faculty and 34.1% by residents. 3 As evidenced in the WMA's state - ment, mistreatment within the profes-sion is also an issue internationally. Among US medical students, 42% reported having experienced harass - ment and 84% experienced belittle-ment during medical school. 4 These students were significantly more like - ly to be stressed, depressed, and sui-cidal; to drink alcohol or binge drink; and were significantly less likely to be glad they trained to become a doctor. 4 Most Canadian medical students do not file a report when they experi-ence instances of mistreatment. More than 80% of students who experi-enced mistreatment stated they had not reported it to their medical school or a designated faculty member. 3 Only 35.9% of students were satisfied with the outcome of having reported instances of mistreatment. 3 Reasons cited by students for not reporting mistreatment included that \"the incident did not seem important enough to report\" (64.7%), \"I did not think anything would be done about it\" (47.1%), and \"fear of reprisal\" (35.3%). 3 References 1.

Cannabis-themed celebra-tions on this date, known as 4/20, have been held since the 1970s when the phenomenon emerged from Cali - fornia's cannabis subculture. 1 Vancouver hosts a large 4/20 event, most recently held at Sunset Beach on English Bay. Crowds have grown from around 10 000 people in 2012 to 40 000 in 2017. 2,3 After noticing a high volume of cannabis-related calls on 4/20 to the BC Drug and Poison Information Centre (DPIC), we sought to describe 4/20 cannabis-exposure callers and assess how they differ from callers on other days of the year. We hy-pothesized that 4/20, as a mainstream event, would attract first-time or oc-casional cannabis users. To explore this we conducted a case-only anal - ysis of poison centre call data from 2013-2016, a method that quantifies the degree to which individual and situational factors modify the risk of a particular outcome. We examined the characteristics of cannabis-exposure callers that might make them more likely to call on 4/20 compared with other days. If a characteristic increases this risk, we would expect a larger portion of 4/20 cannabis callers to have the condition. Characteristics considered included age, sex, cannabis formulation, caller location, and cannabis-use history. Data were extracted from mandato - ry coded fields and case histories in DPIC's call database. bc centre for disease control Calls to BC Poison Control on 4/20: A case-only analysis We defined event cases as call- ers to the poison centre on 4/20 or the day after reporting cannabis ex-posure. Comparison cases were ones reporting cannabis exposures on all other days of the year, excluding days when cannabis call volume exceeded the daily average 99th percentile. Cases reporting the use of illicit sub-stances other than cannabis use were excluded. We identified 19 event and 721 comparison cases from 2013-2016. Univariate regression produced in-teraction odds ratios for the odds of being a cannabis-exposure call on 4/20 among those with certain char - acteristics compared to those without (Table ). The 4/20 callers were more likely to have consumed edible canna-bis products than other formulations, and more often called from the Van-couver Coastal Health Authority re-gion than elsewhere in BC ( Figure ). Controlling for location, the odds of being a 4/20 cannabis caller were 3.7 times higher among consumers of edible marijuana products (95% CI, 1.39-11.82). It was not surprising that 4/20 cannabis users primarily call from Vancouver and consume edibles, con-sidering the large event in Vancouver at which edible products are promot - ed and sold. Ingesting cannabis pro-duces delayed symptoms, often more severe than those experienced from inhalation. Delayed effects and lack of dosage regulations contribute to a phenomenon observed in poison cen-tre calls in which novice users con-sume successive servings of edible cannabis product while waiting for the drug's psychoactive effects to begin. It was surprising that 4/20 calls from first-time users or from certain age groups were not more frequent. It is not mandatory for poison centre staff to ask callers about cannabis-use history, which may explain why first-time user status did not stand out.

This summarizes my daily experiences in the Peruvian Amazon for a rural family-medicine elective. Although on first sight the situations and approaches used seemed drastically different from what would be the norm in Can-ada, I quickly realized that they were just alternative paths to the same endpoint in most cases, and there were more similarities in play than differences. The Centro de Salud Santa Clo- tilde (CSSC) is located adjacent Parallel worlds: Reflections from Centro de Salud Santa Clotilde, Peru Daily experiences in the Peruvian Amazon during a rural family-medicine elective.

Mr Burton's interests include primary care and emergency medicine.bcmd2b the Rio Napo, 5 hours upriver by boat from Iquitos in northeastern Peru. The CSSC provides health care and support services to approximately 15 000 predominantly Indigenous people spread throughout roughly 100 villages. The Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of the Angels from Que-bec took on the tasks of education and health care in the region between 1951 and 1991 as nurse-nuns. Begin-ning in the mid-1980s the physician-priests, Padres Jack McCarthy, MD, and Maurice Schroeder, MD, began to provide medical services and trans-formed the facility into its current state. The centre now boasts a 30-bed inpatient ward, simple OR, birthing room, emergency-procedures room, laboratory, and pharmacy. Inpatient, outpatient, emergency, obstetrical, pediatric, psychological, and dent-istry services are offered. Although the infrastructure is basic, the hospi-tal staff and the services they provide are certainly not. During my time at the CSSC I came to appreciate the breadth of knowledge and amount of advocacy that permeated the daily work at the hospital. 1 Interdisciplinary teamwork Each day began at 6:00 a.m. with the town's public-radio tower crackling to life with the Peruvian national an-them, followed by town news. Hos-pital rounds started promptly at 7:00 a.m. and took the form of a group meeting where announcements were made and everyone had a chance to speak. Everyone, including at times our resident dogs and chickens, then In addition to the simple operating room shown here, the facility has a 30-bed inpatient ward, a birthing room, a lab, and a pharmacy.65 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgrounded on the inpatients, thus en- suring all team members were in-volved in each individual's care and informed of disposition plans. I found it to be an inclusive environment with time to learn and discuss all aspects of care as well as interact with all teams, something which is often lost in large centres in the first world due to high patient volumes. This casual com-munication continued throughout the day with various team members often dropping by to ask for clarification or to share important details. The casual, open environment continued in the outpatient clinic, which is where the majority of work-ing hours were spent. Whenever there was confusion about a case, an inter - esting teaching point to be made, or a second opinion was required, it was a simple exercise to walk to a nearby office and make inquiries. The phys-icians provided abundant information on diseases I had never encountered in the flesh, such as malaria, leish - maniasis, leptospirosis, and ascar - iasis. They were also an incredible resource on critiquing physical exam-ination skills, refining questions on history, and expanding my knowledge of common ailments such as arthritis, respiratory infections, and traumas. Although resources were scarce, there was access to current evidence-based medicine, and I consistent-ly saw the Peruvian doctors using evidence-based applications or quick-ly researching diagnostics or treat-ments via our intermittent satellite Internet connection. However, due to the demands of a low-resource hos-pital attempting to adequately ser - vice so many, there was little time for scholarly endeavors. The demands led to a number of stressful moments, but also added to the camaraderie that came as a result. During my first few dizzying days in this new environment I tried to get a handle on hospital protocols and vil-lage culture. It was comforting to see my old friend the SOAP note when I flipped open my first handwritten foolscap chart, but then I realized that I didn't know what a gota gruesa or a heces fecales was (later determined to be a malaria smear and fecal smear), nor did I understand the various short-hand notes and synonyms for Span-ish descriptions. These would soon become second nature and compar - able to vital signs to me. Although I had spent numerous years studying and practising Spanish in Canada and abroad, I found learning the Spanish medical terminology a steep transi-tion. To add to the confusion, during the first few afternoons I found my-self standing alone in the previously bustling clinic without electricity. This was later explained by the town's afternoon siesta and the public gener - ator, which was only operational for select hours in the morning and even-ing (exceptions to this rule, however, included village celebrations, where one was serenaded until the early hours of the morning with the latest Latin rhythms). As I adapted to the differences in protocol, paperwork, diagnostics, diseases, and lifestyle, I realized that the basic foundation of care and clinical reasoning remained the same, and I fell into a rhythm. Patient expectations Communication between doctors and patients was another learning curve. The relationship was more formal than in Canada. Although physicians would have likely happily included patients in the decision-making pro-cess\u2014something we strive for in Canada\u2014patients seemed more com-fortable simply taking direction. This may have had some roots in the pov-erty and lack of education that many patients struggled with, which be-came apparent to me when I learned that the government-assisted health insurance that the majority of patients accessed was reserved for the poorest in the nation. This scenario wasn't al-ways the case, however, as some pa-tients requested scarce medications and physicians had to navigate diffi-cult conversations, just as they do in Canada. Scarce resources Although the physicians possessed a wealth of knowledge and gave extra-ordinary care given the resources available, there were shortcomings with technology, medications, gener - al supplies, and access to specialists. Almost daily, the pharmacists would announce that the hospital had run out of paracetamol or ampicillin and that we would not be getting a shipment for a month or two. It was also a priv-ilege to have electricity at times when it was most needed, such as during bcmd2b View of the hospital courtyard with inpatient ward to the right and outpatient services to the left.Continued on page 6666 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgprocedures and deliveries, so you could turn your headlamp off for a mo-ment. As well, because we were not equipped to perform any type of im-aging other than simple ultrasounds, everyone played it safe with patients and had a low threshold to admit-and-watch or transfer if they worsened. To complicate matters further, dispos-ition was a unique challenge given the location and environment. Determin-ing where and when patients could safely go home became as important as their diagnosis. Transferring a patient to a spe- cialist had its challenges as well. The Peruvian doctors told me that Iquitos had its limitations and some phys-icians there were reluctant to accept certain transfers. Though this ap-peared to be specialist-dependent, it was disheartening when encountering patients adversely affected by cata-racts or pterygium, and showed that the people in the Napo region had to contend with more than poverty and a lack of resources. In addition, some patients were unable to afford the journey and thus were powerless to receive further treatment. Similarities rather than differences Canada and rural Peru contrast sig- nificantly in areas such as disease type, access to care and medicines, technology, and specialist services. However, I also spent time in Inuvik and Tuktoyaktuk, NWT, along with areas of rural BC, and noticed the same lack of opportunity, poverty, and diseases such as tuberculosis present. This is illustrated by Canada having one of the worst infant mor - tality rates according to the Organisa-tion for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2 During my time in Peru many of the tenets of the Canada Health Act came to mind, along with why they exist\u2014universality, access-ibility, and comprehensiveness. 3 The provisions of the Act ensure that all Canadians have access to timely ad-vanced care, which is not the case in rural Peru, and may be a reason why Peruvians struggle with diseases that are routinely managed in Canada, such as diabetes, hypertension, and their sequelae. And the comparisons are not lim - ited to rural populations; the people in the Napo region struggle with the same issues of alcohol and drug mis-use, domestic violence, and mental illness that plague our urban cores in Canada\u2014which I saw during my clerkship training at St. Paul's Hos-pital in Vancouver. I'm thankful for my time spent in both places. It has made me realize that poverty has the same face no matter what the climate or ethnicity. Patient education It would be naive to think that I could make recommendations on how to better deliver care to rural Peruvians having spent 1 month in a single lo-cation. However, given that many of the causes of inadequate care appear to find roots in poverty\u2014a theme that translates across many countries, and one I'm struggling to fully under - stand\u2014some simple reflections can be made. Although funds are limited in any country, a greater portion dedicated to health care is always helpful. Also, al-leviating the stressors on the determi-bcmd2b nants of health, such as poverty and a lack of formal education and employ-ment opportunities in underserved regions, would be of benefit. One area that doesn't carry a large price tag but has a potentially large impact is patient education. Although the physicians attempted to educate patients and their families on disease processes and medications daily, it of-ten seemed to fall on deaf ears. I en-countered daily conversations about the implications of sporadic use of antimalarials and antibiotics, reluc-tance to use the vaccinations that were available, and the importance of not sharing medications. It's possible that certain misconceptions are rooted in the lack of formalized education as well; however, educating patients on appropriate medication use, such as when presented with patients taking both ranitidine and omeprazole for osteoarthritis, seems correctable re-gardless of educational level. Again, these experiences echo similar con-versations occurring in clinics and hospitals throughout Canada. A privilege to learn I'm deeply grateful for the privilege to have worked with and been men-tored by the great physicians and staff at the CSSC. I encountered diseases that I wouldn't have seen in Canada, which is of great importance given our large immigrant population and Can- A child follows a wayward chicken through the inpatient ward.Continued from page 6567 bc medical journal vol. 60 no. 1, january /february 2018 bcmj.orgobituaries Dr Thomas Lachlan Calder 1927-2017 Dr Thomas Lachlan Calder passed away on 15 September 2017 at home after complications from a stroke that he suffered in May. Dr Calder was born and raised in New Westminster, and graduated from Duke of Connaught High School, where his father, Thomas Hanning Calder, was principal. He went on to study at UBC (BSc 1949) and McGill (MD CM 1953), where he met and wed a fellow medical stu-dent, Norma (\"Tommy\") England\u2014the love of his life for 45 years of marriage. After medical school the Calders moved to West Vancou-ver where they raised six children. Tom practised medicine for 47 years and Norma eventually enjoyed her own medical career and advocacy work. Tom's busy practice was old- fashioned, full-service medicine with house calls, deliveries, sur - gery, hospital rounds, and care of all ages, including a tender focus on the elderly. Tom loved and lived medi - cine and was a respected member of the medical staff at Lions Gate Hos-pital until his retirement in 2000. His other passion was music. Because his children played in a community band and he recognized other adults in his community had the same interest, he co-founded the West Vancouver Adult Band in 1969. He played his euphonium (and other instruments on demand) with several other groups\u2014more so after his retirement from medicine\u2014and he never walked anywhere without humming or whistling like a one-man marching band. His Doctors' Band, composed of retired physicians, played at nursing homes throughout the year. Some band members were older than the audience. Tom was a member of the Kins- men Club back when polio was the battle, as well as a mental health ad-vocate for schizophrenia and men-tal health services. Tom and Norma were strong partners in facing their challenges. In 1980 Norma had a hand in taking a support group of eight people to over 30 Friends of Schizophrenics groups throughout the province, which would later be-come the BC Schizophrenia Society. Norma was recognized for this in-credible volunteerism in 1988 with a Governor General's Silver Medal. Tom's contribution to the evolution of schizophrenia services was at the grassroots level\u2014supporting his sons, watching treatments, and advo-cating for best care. He was also the man behind the scenes for Norma's activities, and while he kept a low profile, he guided and funded mul - tiple initiatives. He also combined his musical talent into the advocacy work, and organized entertainment and music for annual parties and fundraising balls. His Pops Band played at the start of the annual Walk for Schizophrenia as they launched from Lawson Park. Tom also played a major fundraising role to establish a Psychiatry Research Chair at the University of British Columbia, in Norma's name. As he rests in peace, his head- stone reads, \"With music in your heart.\" \u2014Jill Calder, MD, FRCPC Kamloops adians' frequency of travel. I will be a better physician having learned to manage various exotic diseases and refined certain basic skills in a low-resource area. There were draw-backs\u2014dealing with frequent power outages, eating a daily diet of eggs, and being covered in ants and kept up at night by neighborhood dogs (that rested all day). But the experi-ence had benefits that I couldn't recreate, and there are many mo-ments that will be hard to forget\u2014interviewing and assessing patients by headlamp with donated equip - ment during rainstorms, or watching cockroaches scurry out of my under - wear while I searched my shelf for the reprieve of clean laundry. It was humbling to be immersed in a different culture, language, and health care system, and I leave Santa Clotilde with much empathy for the immigrants and travelers who are at-tempting to navigate the Canadian health care system. And I will most definitely take time to listen and un-derstand patients and their families, even when communication is chal-lenging and it's easy to give up, be-cause if you stay a moment longer you'll realize that most people are searching for the same things.
