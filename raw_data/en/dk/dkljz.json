Naturopathic doctors partner with the District of Columbia Department of Parks and Recreation in \"Funky Fitness First Fridays\", an event free to the public, at Wilson Pool 4552 Fort Dr. NW Washington, DC 20016 from 5-8:30pm. Participants in the pool will enjoy Zumba and other fun, aquatic workouts. Naturopathic doctors will be onsite to provide blood pressure checks, natural remedies for the upcoming flu season, and insights on holistic blood and body testing for better health. Naturopathic medicine is a form of medicine that: - Considers the whole person - Focuses on the causes of illness, not just the symptoms - Emphasizes prevention and ongoing wellness - Uses natural treatments that are less invasive and less expensive than conventional drugs and surgery. \"Given the rising costs of health care, the anticipated shortage of primary care physicians, and the ever expanding interest in holistic health and wellness, the public deserves to know more about naturopathic medicine,\" said Dr. Kai Parker President of District of Columbia Association of Naturopathic Physicians. Our members will be holding a range of free events and activities expressly for people who may be curious about natural medicine and how it works compared to conventional medicine.\" There are approximately 5,000 naturopathic doctors (NDs) in the US who are currently licensed, having graduated from an accredited 4-year naturopathic medical school. NDs are rigorously trained in approaches that facilitate the body's inherent self-healing ability. They treat a full range of illnesses and work closely with their patients, guiding and empowering them in education and self-care. \"Naturopathic Medicine Week is officially taking place all across the country in the second week of October, and here in Washington, DC were kicking off the celebration October 7th,\" said Dr. Kai Parker. \"From weight management and diabetes to allergies, digestion and bone health, patients of naturopathic physicians are able to realize improved health and optimal wellness through the principles and practices of naturopathic medicine.\" Resolutions passed by the US Senate have recognized the ability of naturopathic physicians to \"provide safe, effective, and affordable health care\" and to play and essential role in addressing the nation's pressing shortage of primary care physicians.
