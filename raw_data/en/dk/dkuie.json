[Levonorgestrel](https://www.medicinenet.com/levonorgestrel-oral/article.htm)-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), [Mirena](https://www.medicinenet.com/levonorgestrel-releasing_intrauterine-implant/article.htm): This is a small [plastic](https://www.medicinenet.com/plastic/article.htm)device that is placed in the uterus and it slowly releases progestin hormone. It prevents the uterine lining from growing quickly and it is also a type of [contraceptive](https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_methods/article.htm). It has been shown to reduce blood loss by 71 to 96 percent and it is the preferred first choice for treatment. It is usually used for a minimum of 12 months. [Tranexamic acid](https://www.medicinenet.com/tranexamic_acid_lysteda/article.htm): These tablets work by helping blood in the uterus to clot. They reduce blood loss by 29 to 58 percent. They are taken three or four times a day for a maximum of three to four days. The lower end of this dosing range will usually be recommended, for example, two tablets three times a day for a maximum of five days. Treatment should be stopped if symptoms have not improved within three months. - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory [drugs](https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm)( [NSAIDs](https://www.medicinenet.com/nonsteroidal_antiinflammatory_drugs/article.htm)): NSAIDs reduce blood loss by 20 to 49 percent. These tablets are taken from the start of the period (or just before) until the bleeding has stopped. [Combined oral contraceptive](https://www.medicinenet.com/menopause/article.htm)pills: These pills contain the hormones estrogen and progestin. These are taken beginning on the first day of a woman's period. One pill is taken every day for 21 days and then no pills are taken for seven days. - Oral norethisterone: This is a type of man-made progestin (one of the female sex hormones).

The first day of your period is counted as day 1. It works by preventing your uterine lining from growing too quickly. - Injected progestin: A type of progestin called [medroxyprogesterone](https://www.medicinenet.com/medroxyprogesterone/article.htm)acetate is also available as an injection and is sometimes used to treat heavy bleeding. It works by preventing the lining of the womb from growing too quickly and it is a form of [contraception](https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_control_methods/article.htm). It is injected once every 12 weeks for as long as treatment is required. - - Surgery - Uterine artery embolization (UAE): If excessive menstrual bleeding is due to small noncancerous growths called fibroids, then UAE may be done.

Heavy periods, medically known as [menorrhagia](https://www.medicinenet.com/menorrhagia/symptoms.htm), mean having to change your pad or tampon every hour for at least two successive hours. You may also experience [pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/pain_management/article.htm) that makes it difficult for you to carry out your routine activities. Your periods may be heavy due to the following reasons: - Hormonal problems. Having a normal menstrual cycle requires the balancing of two hormones, estrogen, and [progesterone](https://www.medicinenet.com/progesterone-oral/article.htm), which is what causes you to shed the lining of your uterus ( [endometrium](https://www.medicinenet.com/endometriosis/article.htm)) in your menses. When this balance is disturbed, there may be heavy shedding and bleeding. The common causes of hormone problems are [polycystic ovary syndrome](https://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/polycystic_ovary_syndrome_picture/picture.htm)( [PCOS](https://www.medicinenet.com/polycystic_ovary/article.htm)), thyroid problems, and [obesity](https://www.medicinenet.com/obesity_weight_loss/article.htm). - Growths in the uterus. Polyps are small, benign (noncancerous) growths on the lining of the uterus. Fibroids are small-to-large benign tumors that grow within the uterus. Both of these can result in heavy or prolonged periods. - Nonhormonal IUDs. Intrauterine devices or IUDs are devices that women use for birth control. They can be either hormonal or nonhormonal, with the latter potentially causing heavy periods as a side effect. - Complications of [pregnancy](https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm). Rarely, the embryo attaches itself to places outside of the uterus. This condition is called an [ectopic pregnancy](https://www.medicinenet.com/ectopic_pregnancy/article.htm), where the baby cannot grow normally. This results in heavier bleeding during periods. [Miscarriage](https://www.medicinenet.com/miscarriage_causes_and_symptoms/article.htm)can also cause heavy periods. [Cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer/article.htm)of the reproductive system. [Cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_101_pictures_slideshow/article.htm)of the uterus, cervix, or ovaries is another reason why some women may get heavy periods. However, this reason is rare compared to other causes. [Bleeding disorders](https://www.medicinenet.com/blood_and_bleeding_disorders_quiz/quiz.htm). Similar to [cancer](https://www.medicinenet.com/cancer_quiz/quiz.htm), this is also a rare cause of heavy periods. Bleeding disorders that are passed down in your family across generations may make you bleed heavier than usual during injuries as well as periods. - Certain medications. Blood thinners, such as [warfarin](https://www.medicinenet.com/warfarin/article.htm)or anti-inflammatory drugs, may cause excessive bleeding during periods. - Other medical conditions. Existing [kidney disease](https://www.medicinenet.com/kidney_disease_quiz/quiz.htm)or [liver disease](https://www.medicinenet.com/liver_disease/article.htm)may also be the cause of heavy periods. What tests help doctors know the cause of your heavy periods? After reviewing your medical history and asking about your menstrual cycles, your doctor may recommend one or more of the following tests or procedures: - Blood tests. These tests will look at the [hemoglobin](https://www.medicinenet.com/hemoglobin/article.htm)and iron levels (for iron-deficiency [anemia](https://www.medicinenet.com/anemia/article.htm)) and [thyroid hormone](https://www.medicinenet.com/hyperthyroidism_pictures_slideshow/article.htm)levels. [Ultrasound](https://www.medicinenet.com/ultrasound/article.htm). This is an imaging test that uses sound waves to produce images of your reproductive system. [Pap test](https://www.medicinenet.com/pap_smear/article.htm). This is a small procedure in which your doctor takes a small sample of your cervix and sends them to the laboratory for analysis. [Endometrial biopsy](https://www.medicinenet.com/endometrial_biopsy/article.htm). This involves taking a sample of tissue from the inside of the uterus and sending them to the laboratory to check for cancer. [Hysteroscopy](https://www.medicinenet.com/hysteroscopy/article.htm).
