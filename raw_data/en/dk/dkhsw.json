When we conduct an Ayurvedic mucus analysis, we learn a lot. What's the difference between phlegm and mucus? According to [Premier Health](https://www.premierhealth.com/your-health/articles/women-wisdom-wellness-/mucus-and-phlegm-barometers-of-your-health#:~:text=Though%20they're%20always%20at,by%20your%20throat%20and%20lungs), \"Mucus is a thinner secretion from your nose and sinuses.Phlegm is thicker and is made by your throat and lungs.\" Kapha dosha is governed by the elements of water and earth. Nourishing and reliable, Kapha provides structure and stability in our inner and outer worlds. Like the elements it represents, Kapha physical properties are moist, heavy, slow (or dullish), cool, stable, oily, and smooth. Balanced Kapha supports earthiness, endurance, strength, and dependability. It protects critical systems from our immune system and personal boundaries, down to our stomach lining and the fluid in our joints. Out of balance, Kapha manifests as physical and mental \"dullness.\" We may put on a few extra pounds, or feel weighed down, lethargic, foggy, or depressed, and we might have excess mucus. According to Ayurveda, the color and texture of your snot are indicators of our overall health. If our mucus is discolored, or too little or too much, this may indicate an imbalance in the doshas. When we understand how to analyze our mucus, we can proactively address health issues\u2014 as opposed to waiting until our symptoms become conditions and diseases. \"Ayurvedic snot or mucus diagnosis, is a non-invasive diagnostic tool that can see inside us.

We see it (and so does everyone else) in our noses as a nuisance and embarrassment, but let's step back and give mucus a chance to earn the respect it deserves. When we think of mucus, we tend to think only of our noses and maybe sinuses, but the truth is there is a mucosal lining in all of the moist areas of our body including our eyes, [mouth,](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/what-your-tongue-says-about-your-health-according-to-ayurvedic-wisdom) [nose](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/https-www-saumya-ayurveda-com-post-nasya-oil-benefits-how-to-use-nasya-oil-for-greater-wellbeing), [stomach,](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/pitta-dosha-the-5-sub-doshas-and-cooling-heated-digestion) [sinuses](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/8-ayurvedic-sinus-treatments-how-to-have-happy-sinuses-finally), and our thirty-foot-long [digestive ](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/i-don-t-give-a-poop-what-constipation-says-about-your-health-according-to-ayurveda)system. That's a lot of surface area. According to Ayurveda, mucus, (aka [Kapha dosha](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/what-is-ayurveda-anyways)) has two jobs: 1. Kapha protects as it serves as a first line of defense. According to the [National Institute of Health](https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2020/08/marvels-mucus-phlegm), we inhale thousands of microorganisms every hour. Think of snot like those sticky bug strips, bacteria lands on the mucus, and gets trapped. Now consider pollen, dust, and smoke added to the mix, and we're starting to respect mucus the role snot plays a whole lot more. Mucus serves as a filter (protector) against anything we inhale. It's part of our immune system in that it protects us from the world we inhale. Pretty cool, isn't it? 2. Kapha lubricates the tissues to prevent them from drying out. Dry tissue is not much of a bug trap, so when our moist tissues are dry, they no longer function optimally. Think of dry eyes, dry skin, dry lips, dry digestive tract--constipation\u2014and we quickly appreciate the importance of the moist quality of mucus. \" Think of mucus as a firewall between us and the world. Kapha's job of protecting and lubricating is important, and it plays a significant role in keeping us healthy.\" - Veena, Certified Ayurvedic Practitioner, Saumya Ayurveda How Does Healthy Mucus (Kapha) Work? We inhale thousands of microorganisms, dust, and [allergens](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/https-www-saumya-ayurveda-com-post-nasya-oil-benefits-how-to-use-nasya-oil-for-greater-wellbeing) hourly. These invaders land on our mucosal lining and get trapped like bugs on fly paper. The cilia (tiny hairs) have the job of pushing mucus up and out of the lungs, like microscopic janitor's broom sweeping away viruses, bacteria, allergens, smoke, and dust. From our eight sinus cavities, mucus flows like a gentle stream down the back of our throat and we never notice it when our doshas are balanced and healthy--it's just part of our swallowing routine that we perform unconsciously 18-400 times per hour, according to the [National Institute of Health. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8481724/) The mucus and all the crud in it is filtered out to protect us, it goes down stream to the stomach and well, out of our bodies and into the [ toilet.](https://www.saumya-ayurveda.com/post/poop-analysis-with-ayurveda-what-your-poop-says-about-your-health) Genius, right? Are you starting to respect Kapha in the form of mucus now? Our bodies produce about one liter (or more) of mucus daily and its mostly water, which is another reason to hydrate well. Mucus \"also contains special proteins, sugars, and molecules that help the body control harmful germs,\" according to the [National Institute of Health.](https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2020/08/marvels-mucus-phlegm) We don't think about mucus as a liter of fluid flows through us daily as it protects and lubricates. But, once we get sick, all we can do is think about snot! Too Much Mucus (Kapha)? Let's face it, we don't pay attention to snot unless it increases in quantity and/or changes qualities be that color or consistency. Color, consistency, and volume are some of the characteristics of Ayurvedic mucus analysis. When we experience postnasal drip, throat clearing, sore throat, a cough, a clogged or runny nose, or phlegm in the chest, we definitely take notice of our mucus factory then. What Causes Excess Mucus? Imbalanced Kapha dosha is the main culprit when we're flowing and blowing. Where does it all keep coming from?! Ama (toxins) Dust Cold (virus which makes thicker mucus) Pollen Dander Allergens Exhaustion Fire smoke Spicey foods (watery mucus) Incorrect diet Sinus infection (bacteria which makes thicker mucus) Microorganisms Imbalanced doshas Being in a cold climate Stress, fatigue, exhaustion Incorrect food combinations Compromised or imbalanced digestive fire (agni) Living in a climate that is not supportive of your doshic picture What Else Causes Excess Mucus? \"Allergies can also cause your body to make extra mucus. When we have an allergic response, our immune system overreacts to a harmless substance, like pollen, dust, or animal dander...Histamine can make us sneeze. It also causes the mucous membranes in the nose to swell and the glands to make more mucus, \" according to the [National Institute of Health.](https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2020/08/marvels-mucus-phlegm) It gets even more mind (and nose) blowing. \"An infection can make mucus thicker and stickier. Infections also may lead to inflammation in the mucous membranes that line the nose and the rest of your airway. This can cause certain airway glands to make more mucus. That mucus can get thick with bacteria and cells that arrive to fight the infection. That can stimulate even more mucus production.\" ( [National Institute of Health.](https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2020/08/marvels-mucus-phlegm) ) And around and around it goes. When our nose is running it's miserable, yet insufficient flow of mucus isn't healthy either.
