We aim for this document to be a living document capturing the insights of members across the HTAi Society, but also welcoming feedback from everyone. Negotiations between vaccine developers and countries' authorities, often represented by supranational bodies like the [European Commission](https://www.linkedin.com/company/european-commission/?originalSubdomain=nl) and the [World Health Organization](https://www.linkedin.com/company/world-health-organization/mycompany/), to secure procurement and distribute vaccines for COVID-19 have been ongoing throughout the pandemic. Globally, to ensure evidence-based decision making is at the forefront to ensure public health and safety, HTA needs to adapt to this newly emerging situation. The HTA community needs to secure capacities and expertise to adequately manage and overcome the COVID-19 pandemic emergency state as well as be prepared for new potentially (dis)similar emergencies. In order to ensure affordable, equitable and sustainable distribution globally, all aspects of a vaccines development, registration and regulation - inclusive HTA issues such as legal, environmental and socioeconomic impact evaluations - should be paid attention to, proactively. On the short term, in crises situations like the current one, the right balance between urgency and acceptable evidence from investigations into safety and efficacy has to be found. On the longer term, additional issues can be addressed, incl. inclusive cost-effectiveness and real-world data on effectiveness and safety. Vaccines' market access processes are characterised first by the development of recommendations, performed by National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs), i.e., committees like the Joint Committee Vaccination & Immunisation (JCVI), Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices (ACIP) and Japan Committee Vaccines (JCV), often as part of the country's HTA process, and are followed by the executive policy-decision, which includes reimbursement, funding and implementation, sometimes supported by other national HTA bodies and performed by respective Ministries of Health. However, mandates of NITAGs related to the role of HTA bodies as well as factors influencing final decisions on vaccination are not always straightforward. Decision-making around prevention, and vaccines in particular, is not only guided by technical aspects, but also relies on political and societal considerations, often introducing added complexity to inform decisions and the successful implementation thereof. The urgent need for a swift and effective holistic HTA of potential new COVID-19 vaccines is unprecedented. This implies that HTA institutions have to be prepared for very early HTA and to be prepared to support potential emergency use of vaccines. This would require expediting the whole chain in development, registration, financing, production, assessments, upscaling and logistics. [The full statement in detail can be read in the HTAi site.](https://htai.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/COVID-19-Position-Statement.pdf) Key Messages Early Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of COVID-19 vaccines is needed to allow timely upscaling of and access to promising vaccine candidates; Public-private as well as NITAGs-HTA-bodies co-operation is core in all stages of HTA, e.g., evidence generation of vaccination pre- and post-market entry; Registration of COVID-19 vaccines will likely follow abbreviated pathways, which emphasises the need for regular updates of COVID-19 HTA as new data emerges; Various types of COVID-19 vaccines will emerge, with differences in age-groups, number of doses, efficacy, duration of protection and the need for boosters; Prioritisation of vaccination will likely be given to the high-risk group of severe disease outcomes and people at highest occupational risks for transmission of infection, e.g. health staff; Trust in safety of COVID-19 will be crucial for uptake and achieving potential coverage required for herd immunity; HTA attention will shift from safety and effectiveness on the short term to cost-effectiveness issues covered in later stages; Cost-effectiveness analysis will potentially justify high prices for COVID-19 vaccines, however distributional, equity and other aspects concerning ethics and affordability should be considered; Real world data are core to strengthen safety profiles both in the first year and beyond, as well as monitor efficacy and effectiveness in averting disease and transmitting infection; In the longer term, country-specific HTAs, e.g. cost-effectiveness assessments, are still needed in order to prioritise the likely heterogenous array of COVID-19 vaccines. On behalf of the HTAi Public Health IG, Arnold Hagens, Cornelis Boersma, Jurjen van der Schans & Maarten Postma led the development of this position statement in consultation with the HTAi COVID-19 Response Team, an interdisciplinary collective of members of the HTAi Board, Secretariat staff, and others with leadership roles within the Society.
