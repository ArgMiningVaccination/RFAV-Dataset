They can wreak havoc on our endocrine system, reproductive system, as well as cause issues with our lungs, kidneys, and liver. We've talked about those chemicals in detail in a previous post. Today we are going to dive into two great options as you ditch those toxic products and move closer towards your holistic living goals! The first option that we LOVE is Branch Basics. They have created an amazing system that stems from one concentrated bottle of cleaner. It is plant and mineral based, fragrance free, no harmful preservatives, biodegradable, not tested on animals, and non-gmo. This product gets stains out of clothes, keeps your laundry fresh, keeps your kitchen clean, and deep cleans your bathroom. One bottle of concentrate makes 3 all purpose bottles, 3 bathroom bottles, 3 streak free bottles, 3 foaming hand wash bottles, and does 64 loads of laundry. We use it every single day! The second option is a good old, inexpensive (yet powerful) DIY cleaner made of white vinegar, baking soda, and essential oils. You'll need a spray bottle, white vinegar, baking soda, and essential oils of your choice. Put \u00bd cup of vinegar in the bottle and then add in 2 tablespoons of baking soda. Wait for the foaming to subside and add in your essential oils. We recommend a sanitizing blend that includes oils like lemon, clove bud, eucalyptus, tea tree, rosemary and cinnamon but a simple blend of lemon and peppermint is super nice too! Once you have added your EO's, top your bottle off with water, screw on the lid and you are good to go! An alternative recipe would be to take 5-6 organic citrus fruits (lemon, lime or orange) and peel them. Take the peels and put them into a quart sized glass jar and cover with white vinegar. Let this infuse for 6+ weeks in a dark, cool place. Once it's infused, strain out the liquid & save this as a concentrate. You can dilute this with one part vinegar to two parts water for a general all-purpose cleaner! Let us know in the comments what other non-toxic cleaning products "}
