This saying by St. Augustine truly captures the spirit of travel, and India as a vibrant country, provides scores of reasons for travelers from across the world to choose her as their destination. Natural beauty, historical monuments, heritage, vast diversity in terms of resplendent colors, culture, cuisine, pilgrimage all have immense tourism potential. In the recent past even education and medical tourism, adventure, rural and ecotourism have added newer dimensions to Indian travel industry. Not just international, domestic tourism has also grown in leaps and bounds. As per the latest data available, tourism in India has shown a phenomenal growth in the past decade contributing 6.8 per cent to India's GDP. Tourism worldwide, serves as an important employment generator, source of foreign exchange and economic growth. Richly endowed with unique culture, nature, heritage, lively markets, traditional hospitality, India has the tourism product in abundance. The need is to serve it in an attractive manner to the consumer. Tourism industry in any country flourishes on the basis of competitiveness of facilities like infrastructure, accommodation, transport and recreation and that is where the role of various stake holders' right from Central and State Governments to entrepreneurs and society as a whole comes into play. The Government policies provide a framework to promote the sector and facilitate growth. They help put in place a set of guidelines and strategies to boost inflow of tourists. They also provide access to resources and opportunities for employment. Vision of the current government is to achieve 1 per cent of ITA (international tourist arrivals) by the end of 2016-17. Recent introduction of Visa on arrival to visitors from 44 countries across the globe with the aim to extend it to another 106, launch of Mobile app for list of tour operators and classifieds hotels, e-management of tourism and hospitality institutes are some of the steps in the right direction. Schemes like SWADESH DARSHAN for development of theme based circuits, National Mission on Pilgrimage rejuvenation and Augmentation Derive, PRASAD for improvement and beautification of pilgrimage based sites of all faiths are focussed on ensuring 145 crore domestic visits by the end of 2016-17. This apart, programmes like Hunar Se Rozgar Tak and Hunar Zaika have been launched with the intention of generating employment. However it is the vision and talent of the entrepreneur to add economic value to these schemes and resources and exploit them for good of the society as well as their own financial progress. Tourism industry, with its allied sectors, offers widest range of commercial activities like transportation, accommodation and catering, tour packages, entertainment etc. for venturing into business and entrepreneurship. Identifying Innovative and unconventional tourist places, promotion of destinations yet unexplored, hold the key for successful entrepreneurship and sustenance of tourism in India. With India's ideology of Atithi Devo Bhav, a tourist holds the status of 'Guest' and society plays the role of a 'Host'. In the long run however, the Society serves both as a service provider and as the end beneficiary. Tourism becomes the perfect vehicle for inclusive growth of society and positively contributes to the development and poverty alleviation. Travel industry has the potential to change lives and way of approach to people. The industry however needs to grow carefully and in a sustainable manner without causing destruction to environment and society. Safety, security and positive mind-set of the tourists as well as the host communities' are significant players in giving a constructive direction to the phenomenon. The future of tourism in India is certainly bright but we do have a long road ahead. Philosopher Lao Tzu said a journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step, and with recent developments in the sector, that step has already been taken. qYOJANA Going places6 YOJANA May 2015Infrastructure and Tourism DevelopmentTOurISM PrODuCT ExPErIENCE SuPPly ChaIN Manoj Dixit T The Indian tourism industry did not have it so good since the early 1990s. Though the Indian economy has slowed, it is still growing faster than the rest of the world. With Indian economy growing at around 5 per cent per annum and rise in disposable incomes of Indians, an increasing number of people going on holiday trips within the country and abroad is resulting in the tourism industry growing wings. The potential for India to attract tourists is unlimited and tourism can play an increasingly beneficial role in the Indian economy in the years to comeOURISM PRODUCT is a co m p l e x c o n s u m p t i v e experience that results from a process where tourists use multiple of services (information, relative prices, transportation, accommodation, and attraction services (Gunn 1988). Tourist experiences are also shaped by economic and political conditions and structural features which contribute to the nature of the destination product. Murphy et al (2000) related this type of product to a supply and demand analysis and described how the various components of the destination interact with travelers during their trip. The pioneer in acknowledging the role of service infrastructure in creating a product experience was Smith (1994). He suggested that \"service infrastructure is housed within the larger macro-environment or physical plant of the destination\" (Smith, 1994). He also stressed the fact that the level, use, or lack of infrastructure and technology in a destination are also visible and determining features that can enhance the visitors' trip experience. Others who supported his views were Choy (1992); Buharis (2000); and Crouch and Ritchie (2000). They summarized that tourists' overall The author is the Director, Institute of Tourism Studies, University of Lucknow, Lucknow. He has written more than 10 books on tourism and has conducted training programs in capacity building in tourism and hospitality related areas. He is on the advisory/ research boards of several universities for tourism all across India. He had widely traveled and was Adjunct Professor in the University of Science & Technology of China, Chengdu, PR of China.impression develops their image of a destin ation after their visitation and that infrastructure may play an important role in that respect. The tourist destination product is also better understood in the context of comparative and competitive advantage. Crouch and Ritchie (1999), argued that factor conditions are important determinants of attractiveness as tourists travel to a destination to receive the destination experience. E v e r y e l e m e n t h a s b e e n categorised under core attraction and supporting element. The destination's general infrastructure services in this category in fact, represent one of the most important factors. The tourism phenomenon relies heavily on public utilities and infrastructural support. Tourism planning and development would not be possible without roads, airports, harbours, electricity, sewage, and potable water. The infrastructural dimension is thus, a necessary element for tourism development and the above factors are all basic elements for attracting visitors to a destination. Generally, infrastructure has not been included in empirical works because it is expected to be available at a destination and has not been promoted as an attraction YOJANA May 2015 7factor. Smith (1994), and Crouch and Ritchie (1999) provide a good theoretical treatment of the role of service infrastructure in creating a tourism product experience. Indian Infrastructure and Tourism Tourism infrastructure is the supply chain of transport, social and environmental infrastructure collaborating at a regional level to create a destination including: Transport infrastructure which provides the visitor access from international and domestic source markets to destinations; and includes airports, major roads and rail. Social infrastructure which is the stock of rooms to accommodate visitors and physical structures for exhibitions, events and services that attract visitors. This infrastructure includes hotels, convention centres, stadiums, galleries and tourist precincts in a destination. Environmental infrastructure which is the natural estate of national parks, marine parks and reserves, including visitor facilities. Collaborative infrastructure which is the network of regional, state and national tourism organizations that market destinations and distribute tourism products. The supply chain of tourism infrastructure and product is illustrated in Figure 1. This tourism infrastructure is primarily built on private capital, with the private sector contributing 78 per cent of total tourism investment. International airports and accommodation room stock is private infrastructure. Road, rail and seaports are typically public infrastructure. Infrastructure such as convention centres and national parks are public assets provided for social and environmental policy objectives. Conde Nast ranked India amongst the top 10 tourist destinations. India is probably the only country that offers various categories of tourism. These include mountains, forests, history, adventure tourism, medical tourism (including ayurveda and other forms of Indian medications), spiritual tourism, beach tourism (India has the longest coastline in the East), etc. It has been said that destinations in India are more diverse than the countries elsewhere. Each region of India has a unique culture, festivals/ dress, monumental heritage and edification. The Indian tourism industry did not have it so good since the early 1990s. Though the Indian economy has slowed, it is still growing faster than the rest of the world. With Indian economy growing at around 5 per cent per annum and rise in disposable incomes of Indians, an increasing number of people going on holiday trips within the country and abroad is resulting in the tourism industry growing wings. The potential for India to attract tourists is unlimited and tourism can play an increasingly beneficial role in the Indian economy in the years to come. Despite the numerous problems, tourism industry was the second-largest foreign exchange earner for India. Tourism contributed 6.6 per cent of India's GDP and created 39.5 million jobs in 2012. The total number of inbound tourists has grown at 16 per cent in the last five years and is expected to grow at 12 per cent in the next decade. During 2013, travel and tourism industry contributed Rs 63,160 crore to the economy. International tourists account for a little over 5 million visitors, while domestic market is seen at more than 500 million. The growth pattern suggests that Indian tourism growth is not solely based on foreign tourist arrivals alone as due to global reasons and disturbances, this phenomenon is always affected adversely. However, domestic tourism has been growing in a settled way. Fairs and festivals of India are continuous phenomena. Events like Kumbha in north and Onam and Mahamastakabhisheka in the south are events that fetch a lot of tourists almost every year. A look at the Figure-3 will denote explicitly that despite potential and abundance of natural beauty, many states have failed to attract tourism - like north-eastern states, Lakshadweep and Chhattisgarh - not because of any reason other than lack of tourism infrastructure. According to Deloitte Touche, the Indian tourism sector is likely to generate nearly $42.8 billion by 2017. Despite the challenges being faced in terms of a slowing economy, sluggish demand and security concerns, the country was fighting back and tourism developments were taking place. 'Despite the deepening world economic crisis, India's economy remains in decent shape and is still experiencing some of the strongest growth rates in the world', the Deloitte report said. It is fast turning into a volume game where, an ever-burgeoning number of participants are pushing up revenues of industry players (hotels, tour operators, airlines, shipping lines, etc). This will result in greater room occupancies and average room revenues (ARRs) in the country. ARRs have moved up and room occupancy rates have also shot up. Thus, the tourism sector is expected to perform well in future and the industry offers an interesting investment opportunity for long-term investors. Realizing the potential in India, international and domestic hotel Figure 1: Tourism Supply Chain8 YOJANA May 2015chains were rushing to cash in on it. Medical tourism was poised for rapid development in the future and India is busy developing first-class facilities to attract this multi-billion dollar niche market. The sudden boom in tourism in India took the tourism industry by storm forcing everyone to think how to sustain the growth. In fact, tourism is a trillion dollar industry making it one of the largest foreign exchange earners and generator of employment in India.

The competitiveness of these facilities at a national or international scale determines whether they become valuable assets for, or likely impediments to, attracting visitors to a destination. Plans for improving the overall attraction of a destination need to be based on detailed information highlighting the current state of such infrastructure. It is quite obvious that India does not possess good roads. Only 12 per cent meet world class criteria. This is far too less to attract international tourists. Entire Europe loves to travel by road for tourism purposes; but Indians have to think multiple times before trav elling on roads. Moreover, undisciplin ed driving makes it even more dangerous. India has one of the highest rankings in road accidents. About 28 per cent of the route kilometer, 39 per cent of running track kilometer and 41 per cent of total track kilometer is electrified. Inland water Transport India has about 14,500 km of navigable waterways which comprises rivers, canals, backwaters, creeks, etc. About 50 million tonnes of cargo corresponding to 2.82 billion tonne was transported in 2006-07 by Inland Water Transport (IWT). Its operations are currently r estricted to a few stretches in the Ganga-Bhagirathi-Hooghly Rivers, The Brahmaputra, the Barak Riv er, the rivers in Goa, the backwaters in Kerala, inland waters in Mumbai and the deltaic regions of the Godavari-Krishna rivers. Besides the organized operations by mechanized vessels, country boats of various capacities also operate in various rivers and canals. Data of cargo and passenger movement in unorganized sector (i.e. by country boats, etc.) has not been compiled but it is a fact that substantial quantum of cargo and passengers are transported in the unorganized sector as well. Airports in India India has 46 airports; however, there are not many which connect with the rest of the country. Due to this, the time taken for travelling by air is many times more than what is taken by train. For example, if one wishes to travel from Agra to Varanasi or Jaipur by air, he or she will have to go to Delhi before boarding any other flight. If India does not take advantage of this tourism revolution, it will have only herself to blame. With just a few initiatives, India can really take benefits of this sunrise sector. The lack of infrastructure is visible in all segments of tourism be it related to airports, railway, surface transport, accommodation trained manpower, shopping with ease, traveling in style, medical tourism, tourism education, sustainable development norms etc. The tourism industry can maximize on the infrastructure development part by providing priority to tourism tax incentives to private sector, specialized norms for single window clearance for foreign investments, creating land, bank financial assistance mainly long term loan on low rate of interest, free flow of foreign exchange in the country, involving professionals and less interference by bureaucrats or free from red-tape. This is the right approach and o nly way to boost infrastructure. Figure 4: Foreign Tourist Arrivals from Top 15 markets (2013) (Numbers in Million and Percentage share) S.

So a very selective approach is also needed. India's infrastructure problems arise not just from its inability to create facilities as has been seen in the National Highways Development programmes, railway, expensive programmes for airport developments. Equally frustrating is the failure of most images of these infrastructure projects to identify the last minute problems and fix them before they become unmanageable. Despite the high voltage official \"Incredible India campaign\" to sell the country as an alternative destination, the Tourist footfalls are rather modest for a continent sized country. The only way we can progress is \"Improve Infrastructure deficiency\" and till we become proactive, our tourist arrivals will stagnate at 5 or 6 million only. It is heartening that the Union Ministry of Tourism (MOT) has issued guidelines for tourism infrastructure so that all states can create world class tourism infrastructure. Some outlines of this guideline indicate that there is a move the right direction. 1. State/UT Administration should, as far as possible, employ architects, including conservation and landscape architects following codal formalities and these should be funded from their own resources. 2. Efforts should be made by the State/ UT Administration to have one window clearance for tourism related projects. 3. While formulating the schemes under Mega Destination Projects/circuits by the States/UTs, attempts should be made to bring convergence with the JNNURM. urban Civic Amenities 1. States should create all weather circulation networks and connectivity including creation of barrier free environment in and around tourist destinations for all users. 2. Proper attention would need to be given to the following: l Design Codes, Aesthetics and Anthropometrics, choice of materials, fabrication, durability, weathering and maintenance. l S i g n a g e : A d e q u a c y a n d Placement. l Litter/recycling bins. l Information/way finding. l Information and Tourist Facilitation/ Convenience Centre l Public toilets. l Parking units, including parking for two-wheelers and parking facilities for the physically challenged. 3. S t a t e s / U n i o n T e r r i t o r y Administrations should encourage free and frequent distribution of high quality tourist maps, guides, CDs, posters, tourism calendars, fold and take along maps; also very strong graphic display to promote India's vibrant and diverse culture. 4. Detailed project report must make clear that the land is available with the implementing agency. If a project sanctioned by the Ministry has not been started due to non- availability of land even after one year, the project will be dropped and the funds will be recovered or adjusted. 5. Wayside amenities should be located after about every 50kms on the way leading to the tourist destinations/ circuits. 6. Signages must conform to, as far as possible, international code (World Tourism Organisation websites for Signages). 7. States/UT Administrations should make effort to upgrade and strengthen existing tourist facilities as a part of the tourism policy from their own resources. 8. States should pu t in place, as far as possible, institutional mechanism for management through any Figure 6: No. of Hotels and Hotel Rooms in India (Govt of India recognized) Number of Approved Hotels and Availability of Hotel Rooms During 2013 Category of Hotels Number of Hotels Number of Rooms One Star 82 2086 Two Star 121 3154 Three Star 637 26617 Four Star 111 7738 Five Star 85 10128 Five Star Deluxe 106 21820 Apartment Hotels 3 249 Time Share Resorts 1 31 Heritage Hotels 46 1322 B & B Establishments 31 158 Guest House 4 61 Unclassified 30 1989 Source: Ministry of Tourism, Government of India, Market Research Division, Tourism Statistics 2013 Figure 7: Indian Roads National Highways/Expressways 65,590 km State Highways 1,28,000 km Major and other Disctric Roads 4,70,000 km Rural Roads 26,50,000 km http://www.ibef.org/industry/roads-india.aspxYOJANA May 2015 11Figure 8 : Railways in India Gauge Route in Km Running Track in Km Total Tack in Km Borad Guage mm) 3,198 Source: http://www.ibef.org/industry/roads-india.aspx appropriate agency, of public convenie nces after following codal formalities. Built Heritage & Signages 1. S t a t e s / U n i o n T e r r i t o r y Administrations should formulate, as far as possible, a Comprehensive Conservation Master Plan including research, documentation, value-significance, damage assessment, conservation, management, tourism infrastructure, risk assessment (carrying capacity), site interpretation, safety/first aid and security, universal access, waste management, community consultations and engagement implementation strategy, business plan etc. 2. S t a t e s / U n i o n T e r r i t o r y Administrations may follow international norms and guidelines/UNESCO Charters for World Heritage Sites in particular and for other heritage sites/monuments in general <http://whc.unesco.org/en/guideline s>. 3. For signages, UNWTO guidelines and NHAI guidelines (directional signages) are recommended to be followed. 4. The conservation and tourism development plans of the States/Union Territory Administrations should have sound financial and maintenance plans. 5. S t a t e s / U n i o n T e r r i t o r y Administrations should put in place some appropriate institutional mechanism for timely completion and post implementati on maintenance of the project/ destination.6. For operation and maintenance, public private partnership (PPP) mode should be encouraged. Climatically Responsive and Vernacular Architecture 1. Attempts should be made to design climatically responsive and location sensitive tourism architecture. 2. Emphasis should be given on available local material and technology, vernacular design principles. 3. Efforts should be made for capacity building of all tourism personnel regarding location, environment and contextual characteristics of tourist spots. This could be funded from the Ministry of Tourism's CBSP Scheme. urban Landscape 1. Local ambience should be reflected in landscape with the use of local materials. 2. Use of Indigenous species/ Native species should be encouraged in plantscape. 3. Use of traditional methodology in construction techniques if found appropriate, should be explored and encouraged. 4. States/Union Territories should try to ensure that: l Bare minimum earthwork should be resorted to by retaining existing land profile as far as possible. l Rainwater harvesting, ground water recharging and zero discharge should be adopted. l Appropriate designs for the boundary work should be evolved keeping in view the aesthetics, security and cost factor. The cost should not generally exceed 20 per cent of allocated budget of a particular scheme. l Solar lighting and use of renewable energy are encouraged. l Minimal use of Hardscape materials. 5. States/Union Territories should: l Discourage fountains and such water-based elements in areas with water paucity. l Discourage large scale illumination in areas with electricity shortage without compromising security. l Ensure that water source, required quantity of water and irrigation system are available before commencing the project. l Promote 'accessible' infrastructure. l Prepare and present maintenance Plan and maintenance budget to be presented for 5 years to ensure sustainability of projects. This should be funded through State Government/UT Administration or Public-private partnership. Food Craft Institutes and Hotel Management Institutes 1. Areas of future expansion should be undertaken but no auditorium should be constructed. 2. Master plan of the whole complex should be planned. 3. Landscape for project should be only to meet the essential requirements. India's tourism is at a threshold of a quantum jump. However, she has to realize that no country is going to wait 12 YOJANA May 2015for her. It is a cut throat competition among all developing nations as it is the backbone of their economy. Countries like China, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia are spending heavily on building tourism infrastructure so as to attract more and more; and they are successful in their efforts. India, on the other hand, is still setting its priorities right. To conclude, I must say that all attractions are meaningless if accessibility is not smooth. Indian planners will have to understand this. The sooner, the better. Roads and rails are not going to serve tourists alone; India's economy too will get a big boost if this is done. Readings 1.

The ETA list includes nations like US, Germany and UAE which cover 40 per cent of our inbound arrivals currently. Although, e-Tourist Visa cannot be the sole source for growth in foreign tourist arrivals, but will certainly act as a key input to accelerate foreign tourist arrivalsOUR ISM IS travel for recreation, leisure, religious, family or business purposes, usually for a limited duration. Tourism is generally associated with international travel, but may also refer to travel to another place within the same country. The World Tourism Organization defines tourists as people \"travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes\". Tourism has become a popular global leisure activity. Tourism can be either domestic or international, and international tourism can be classified as either inbound or outbound tourism. Today, inbound tourism is a major source of income for many countries, especially in terms of foreign exchange earned by the country as a whole. It also has a substantial impact on the local economy and employment of a place frequently visited by tourists. India is a country with a rich cultural heritage which has always fascinated travellers. It is a unique land of diversities where all kinds of natural beauty including desert, sea, forests, mountains, flowers, wildlife is present within a single geographical boundary of a country. Anybody visiting India will have experience of Nanu Bhasin is Director, Press Information Bureau, New Delhi. Navneet Kaur is Dy.

Thus, India has always been a destination for tourists who want to enjoy this combination of culture, tradition and rich heritage. Not only this, the foreign tourists act as \"Ambassadors of Indian culture\" and take the message further across the world. Indian government has made various efforts to take advantage of these unique possessions to promote tourism. One such big initiative is the scheme of e-Tourist Visa.This measure has been introduced to make travelling to India easier and simpler for foreign tourists. e-Tourist Visa : Background The entire scheme began with the demand by the Tourism industry to liberalise the visa regime for foreign tourists to give a boost to tourism in the country. In response, 'Visa -on- Arrival' was initiated by the Government in 2010 on a very limited scale. 'Visa-on-arrival' means that you need a visa to enter, but it is possible to apply for and receive the visa only when you show up in the country of visit itself. The Government of India introduced the concept of Visa on Arrival (VoA) in January 2010 for citizens of five countries ie Finland, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand YOJANA May 2015 15and Singapore visiting India for tourism purposes. The processing of Visa on Arrival was manual during this period. Visa on Arrival (V oA) was further extended to citizens of six more countries namely Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, Laos and Myanmar in January 2011 and South Korea in April, 2014. Till this stage, the V oA scheme remained operational on a very limited scale. However, the scheme was substantially scaled up by the new government when it was further extended to 43 countries w.e.f. 27th November, 2014 and to Guyana in January 2015 bringing the total number of countries under the Scheme to 44. The concept of Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) was also introduced at the same time. Electronic Travel Authorization: e-Tourist Visa To attract more foreign tourists, a very important step taken by the new Government is the introduction of Electronic Authorization (ETA) enabled Tourist Visa on Arrival, which is now re-named as e-Tourist Visa but with no change in the scheme guidelines of ETA enabled TV oA. The government proposes to take the tally to 106 countries within 2015-16 itself. The new scheme , e-Tourist Visa, has helped the prospective short duration traveller to apply for an Indian Visa from his/her home country online without visiting the Indian Mission and also pay the visa fee online. Once approved, the applicant receives an email authorising him/her to travel to India and he/she can travel with a print out of this authorization. On arrival, the visitor has to present the authorisation to the immigration authorities who would then stamp the entry into the country. Currently, the V oA is valid for one month, allows single entry only, and is non-extendable. e-Tourist Visa can be availed of by International Travellers whose sole objective of visiting India is recreation, sight see ing, casual visit to meet friends or relatives, short duration medical treatment or casual business visit. It is not applicable to holders of Diplomatic/official passports. The intention of e-Tourist Visa is to facilitate legitimate travellers by strengthening the security framework through a completely IT- enabled environment. Travel lers had faced issues with the VoA facility launched in 2010 because it was not IT integrated. The new system is fully digitised, simple and user-friendly, and therefore eliminates all the hurdles. Scope of e-Tourist Visa The Immigration Department has set up 72 dedicated counters at nine airports\u2014Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, and Goa - to facilitate and take care of e-Tourist Visa travellers. Table 1: Progress of TVoA/e-Tourist Visa scheme of Ministry of Tourism, Government of India\" Table 2: No. of 'e-Tourist Visa' vs 'Manual TVoA'* Year January Ministry of Tourism, Government of India *Percentage increase over same month of previous year. *No pre-authorization was required during the initial Manual TV oA scheme. 16 YOJANA May 2015Currently, e-Tourist visa facility is availa ble at only these nine airports. However, the foreigner can take exit from any of the authorized Immigration Check Posts (ICPs) in India. As on January 2015, e-Tourist Visa was available for following 44 countries: Australia, Brazil, Cambodia, Cook Islands, Djibouti, Fiji, Finland, Germany, Guyana, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Kiribati, Laos, Luxembourg, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Mexico, Micronesia, Myanmar, Nauru, New Zealand,Niue Island, Norway, Oman, Palau, Palestine, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Russia, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands,Thailand, Tonga, Tuvalu, UAE, Ukraine, USA, Vanuatu, Vietnam. After introduction of e-Tourist Visa, the manual Visa on arrival without requirement of a pre-authorization prior to travel was earlier available for 12 countries. Success of e-Tourist Visa The implementation of the scheme will send out a clear message that India is serious in making travel to the country easy and the scheme will contribute to taking India's share in International Tourist Arrivals to 1 per cent by the end of 12 th Five Year Plan as compared to the current share of 0.64 per cent. As the Table-2 shows, there has been a substantive growth in the number of tourists availing of e-Tourist Visa after the introduction of ETA. During the month of March 2015, a total of 25,851 tourists arrived by e-Tourist Visa as compared to 1,958 TV oA of previous scheme during the month of March 2014, registering a growth of 1220.3 per cent. Similarly, during the month of February 2015, a total of 24,985 tourists arrived by e-Tourist Visa as compared to 1,980 TV oA of previous scheme during the month of February 2014, registering a growth of 1161.9 per cent. During January- March 2015, a total of 75,859 tourist arrived by e-Tourist Visa as compared to 5,841 TVoA during January- March 2014, registering a growth of 1198.7 per cent. As per latest available data, as on 14th April, 2015 nearly one lakh ten thousand Visas have been issued by the Government under the scheme. This high growth may be attributed to introduction of e-Tourist Visa scheme currently running for more than 40 countries as against coverage of earlier TV oA scheme for 12 countries only. The percentage share of top 10 source countries for e-Tourist Visa, in India during March 2015, were as follows: USA (33.25 per cent), Germany (14.64 per cent), Russian Federation (13.13 per cent), Australia (8.37 per cent), Republic of Korea (6.39 per cent), Ukraine (4.21 per cent), Mexico (2.93 per cent), Japan (1.99 per cent), New Zealand (1.91 per cent) and Israel (1.68 per cent) . The percentage shares of different ports for e-Tourist Visa, in India during March 2015, were as follows: New Delhi (47.32 per cent), Mumbai (18.55 per cent), Goa (12.03 per cent), Bengaluru (6.27 per Chennai (5.60 per cent), Hyderabad (2.93 per cent), Kolkata (2.78 per cent), Kochi (2.68 per cent) and Trivandrum (1.84 per cent) Issues related to e-Tourist Visa Although e-Tourist Visa is now available to more than 40 countries , the scheme is yet to become operational for several countries like China , United Kingdom , Spain , Italy and Malaysia, which are important from the tourism perspective. Similarly, the facility needs to be extended to several other airports like Varanasi, Gaya, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Tiruchirapalli which are important hubs of foreign tourist arrivals in India. This will also help to disperse the burden of tourists at the current 9 airports where the facility is applicable. A demand is also being raised by the stakeholders and tourists that multiple entry should be allowed along with the visa on arrival facility, so that any tourist coming to India can visit neighbouring countries also. The multiple entry will promote the growth in the Foreign Tourist arrivals. Similarly, there are demands for increasing the visa period to two months to give a greater flexibility to the tourists. International Travellers are also facing the difficulty of Biometrics for which applicants have to travel long distances in their home country which negates the very purpose of online application. Since the discontinuation of manual VoA , foreign tourists are calling it a misnomer. They say that the new scheme is only an e-Visa and not a Visa on Arrival in the true sense since no pre-authorization is required in the latter. Conclusion:In a nutshell, the e-Tourist Visa has helped to meet the long standing demand of Tourism industry for a liberalised visa regime for the last 20 years. The ETA list includes nations like US, Germany and UAE which cover 40 per cent of our inbound arrivals currently. Although, e-Tourist Visa cannot be the sole source for growth in foreign tourist arrivals, but will certainly act as a key input to accelerate foreign tourist arrivals. E-Tourist Visa certainly makes destination India more attractive for tourists. Readings 1. Market Research & Statistics Division of Ministry of Tourism, Govt of India 2.

It is necessary to have a synergistic, multi- institution focussed approach towards identification, planning and development of tourism products and services, in collaboration with tourism ministry, ministry of culture and other related ministries, having heritage as the core driver of tourism industry in the countryHE UPTURN in India's economic scene and its fecund culture has created a world-wide veneration for India. Resident Indians with their slice of disposable income have also become aggrandized to pursue tourism passions, though pilgrimage had its presence in all strata of society. The World Economic Forum Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report 2013 ranks India's cultural heritage at 11 th in Asia Pacific region, ranked 9th in natural resources, 24th in cultural resources and 65thin overall among all economies. How to reap the optimal benefit of tourism potential? Integrative approach involving different realms of tourism along with an overhaul of the industry partners is in dire need. Tourism streaks off from societal edifice and so it must be in such a state to roll out service and in turn every strata of society must get the spin-off. The Economic Survey of India tabled in the year 2012-2013, mentioned the Tourism Satellite Account data of 2009 - 2010 which demonstrates that the tourism contributed 6.8 per cent to India's GDP out of which 3.7 per cent was direct and 3.1 per cent indirect. Tourism also contributed significantly towards generating employment. Directly, it contrib uted 4.4 per cent towards employment generation and The author is a freelance journalist in both print and electronic media.He has been writing and broadcasting on art, culture and travels in India and abroad.5.8 per cent indirectly. As per the Ministry of Tourism, 'In India, the travel and tourism sector is estimated to create 78 jobs per million rupees of investment' as compared to 45 jobs in the manufacturing sector for unskilled to the specialized and also a higher proportion of tourism benefits (jobs and petty trade opportunities) accrue to women. The number of Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTAs) in India during 2013 increased to 6.97 million as compared to 6.58 million in 2012. The growth rate in FTAs during 2013 over 2012 was 5.9 per cent as compared to 4.3 per cent during 2012 over 2011. The growth rate of 5.9 per cent in 2013 for India was better than growth rate of 5 per cent for the International Tourist Arrivals in 2013.About 91 per cent of the FTAs entered India through air routes followed by land routes and 0.5 per cent by sea-routes. Delhi and Mumbai airports accounted for about 52.8 per cent of the total FTAs in India.The top 15 source markets for FTAs in India in 2013 were USA, UK, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka,Russian Federation, Canada, Germany, France, Malaysia, Japan, Australia, China, Singapore, Thailand and Nepal. These 15 countries accounted for about 70.72 per cent of total FTAs in India in 2013. United Nations World Tourist Organisation conjecture Indian tourism growth by 8 per cent per annum till 2016. YOJANA May 2015 19Number of domestic tourist visits in India during 20 13 was 1145.28 million as compared to 1045.05 million in 2012 with a growth rate of 9.6 per cent. Tourism continues to play an important role as a foreign exchange earner for the country. In 2013, foreign exchange earnings (FEE) from tourism were US $ 18.45 billion as compared to US $17.74 billion in 2012, registering a growth of 4.0 per cent. In 2016, FTAs are projected to be 11.24 million, Domestic Tourist Visits (DTVs) to be 1451.46 million, FEEs to be US $ 30.3 billion and total employment contribution to be 24.5 million. Capacity Building and Skill Development Measures The tourism sector in the country has been experiencing a huge deficit in quality human resources. This scheme for capacity building envisages creating and upgrading adequate institutional infrastructure for training and certification of manpower resources. Emphasis is placed on opening of new institutes such as Institutes of Hotel Management and Food Craft Institute. By 31 st July 2011, 16 state IHMs and 13 FCIs were sanctioned. Skill testing and certification facilities at 15 state IHMs were instituted for the benefit of the existing service providers. As per Ministry of Tourism, during 2010-2011, 9869 service providers were certified under this scheme as against a target of 5500. GOI's flagship program, 'Hunar Se Rozgar' aims to train 8 th class pass- outs (up to 28 years of age) in Food Production and Food & Beverages Services. This program is conducted through the MoT sponsored Institute of Hotel Management's (IHMs) and Food Craft Institute's (FCIs) at select State Government Institutes and certain star category hotels. 6981 youth were trained under this program against a target of 5500, in 2010-2011. 100 per cent utilization of allocated fund of Rs 350 crores was achieved under these schemes during the first 4 years of 11 th Plan. During the 12th Plan, several religious circuits were given thrust. The 12th Five Year Plan redeems the need of pro-poor tourism to ensure increasing net benefits to the poor and poverty alleviation.

This is where the cooperative model can help bridge the divide. Rather than individual efforts being driven single-handedly, the cooperative model brings all aspects of a tourism product under the ambit of a cooperative structure, which not only controls the structure and volume of tourist activity, but also ensures that the entire destination is promoted rather than remain as fragmented independent entities. A project being funded from the Scottish Government's International Development Fund envisages the establishment of a co-operative tourism development project in rural India, aiming to deliver sustainable economic development in some of the most socially and economically disadvantaged districts of India by building the capacity of local communities to realize the potential value of their natural and cultural heritage to create tourism enterprise opportunities through a co-operative destination management organization (CDMO) model. The project has been completed in the states of Uttarakhand and West Bengal, and the way ahead involves laying out the roadmap for creating a network of such cooperatives across the country, and identifying how efficiently the skills that have set up the model in GOI's flagship program, 'Hunar Se Rozgar' aims to train 8th class pass- outs (up to 28 years of age) in Food Production and Food & Beverages Services. This program is conducted through the MoT sponsored Institute of Hotel Management's (IHMs) and Food Craft Institute's (FCIs) at select State Government Institutes and certain star category hotels. 20 YOJANA May 2015one region can be adaptively imparted across other regions. Infrastructure Initiatives Adequate infrastructure facilities are vital for the tourism industry. Thus, the Ministry of Tourism has been making efforts to develop quality infrastructure at tourist destinations and circuits. The Ministry has launched schemes for development of nationally and internationally important destinations and circuits through Mega Projects. It is also working along with other Central Government Ministries - Railways, Civil Aviation, Road Transport & Highways, and Food Processing and Urban Development and the concerned state governments to have a focused approach on development. So far, 53 mega projects have been identified, out of which, 35 projects have already been sanctioned. The mega projects are a judicious mix of culture, heritage, spiritual and eco-tourism in order to give tourists a holistic perspective. Heritage Tourism Heritage tourism holds up natural heritage, cultural heritage as well as historic heritage with permeated connotations and subtle imprints of India's legacy. The relevance and subtlety of heritage has to come up in all sections of Indian society. An imposing structure, a mammoth building, some religious facets of individual interest have been the pulling force for the larger populace. But now with evolving Indian perceptions, new aspirations are taking stock of heritage to get a real feel of monuments and culture in an encompassing ambit.In dia already has 28 world heritage sites. The concept of heritage trail can be a riveting experience. Son-et- lumi\u00e8re has proven its success. An ambience of the then society needs to be recreated. Diorama depictions are a potent tool. Such experience matters to tourists that includes a sizeable number of children as well. But all these require a lot of scholarly input as well as adaptive qualities. So a huge number of scholars and designers as well as science technocrats have to put in a well-concerted effort. Music and dance festivals and literary festivals are prudent ways to reach across. The ambit of these festivals has to be adjudged with the target tourist community.Over 300 fairs happen every year across the Indian mainland. The joie de vivre of these congregations do attract people from other places. Heritage sport events of horse polo in Manipur, animal or animal-cart or chariot races are bound to regale tourists. Regatta events have been a resounding tourist puller. A study done by the United Nations World Tourism Organization puts it - l E s t a b l i s h p r o j e c t s w i t h c o m m u n i t i e s , t h e h e r i t a g e management sector and educational institutions to document Intangible Cultural Heritage assets that are either disappearing or undergoing revitalization / change. l Promote performances of local culture that provide useful information and do not disrespect core cultural values. l Protect the intellectual property rights of communities with regards to Intangible Cultural Heritage products used in souvenirs and other items (such as traditional music CDs, food recipes, cosmetics and medicines) l Work with relevant stakeholders to devise strategies for the creation of new Tourism & Intangible Cultural Heritage products, improving links to existing products, and marketing products responsibly. Rural Tourism India's rural heritage is prolific and exotic e nough to elicit world interest including domestic Indians. The core areas of the interests of tourists need to be identified in areas such as art and craft, handloom and textiles among others. This is quite intricate and an elaborate procedure. Interaction between tourists and local population can be a mutually enriching experience. Intangible heritage has to be promoted and also safeguarded. Rural tourism in Kerala and certain parts of Himachal Pradesh have brandished its charisma. If Gujarat boasts of 16 types of gaudy embroideries, let the artisan community be trained through Village Level Council, government agency or some NGO. Let the hosts and artisans further know about their folklore. At times, they may be given limited tutelage of history so that what they share with tourists does not become a figment of folklore fantasy.In case of homestay tourism, the hosts need to eliminate their unhygienic ways if any, so as to be a congenial host. If the area has mosquito problem, then the health department has to carry out steps like fumigation. Similarly sanitation of such areas needs to be spruced up. There need to be medical centres with ambulances. In areas of thugs, stringent precautions need to be taken. The worst undersirable stock that tourism gets is when tourists get fleeced. Smarmy hosts and avaricious raconteurs will create aversion amongst tourists. Comprehensive India's rural heritage is prolific and exotic enough to elicit world interest including domestic Indians. The core areas of the interests of tourists need to be identified in areas such as art and craft, handloom and textiles among others. This is quite intricate and an elaborate procedure. Interaction between tourists and local population can be a mutually enriching experience. Intangible heritage has to be promoted and also safeguarded.YOJANA May 2015 21measures have to be made to ward off such behavio r. Also, the expectation of gratis from tourists by showcasing their plight turns off credulous tourists. A local nodal agency needs to be put up in the areas which might survey the tourists. Rural households offering homestay should inform the agency about their guests. The socio-economic benefits to rural community may stop the exodus from rural to urban areas. So far, 153 rural tourism projects in 28 states/Union Territories have been sanctioned by the Ministry of Tourism including 36 rural sites where UNDP has supported for capacity building.Organisations like Tribal Cooperative Marketing Development Federation of India Ltd (TRIFED) and Export Promotion Council of Handicrafts can play worthwhile roles. Adventure Tourism The boom in the adventure tourism sector can, to some extent, be attributed to the economic growth post 1992, especially around the new millennium based on the rapid rise of the IT sector, as economic growth implied that the travellers, especially the 'youth' segment who are more drawn to such activities and have a higher travel propensity, had more disposable income at hand, and could afford the relatively higher costs involved in adventure and nature based products. Government Initiatives The Ministry of Tourism also recognized the potential of the niche, especially since adventure tourism would take within its folds the emerging forms of sustainable and responsible tourism. By the very nature of the product, adventure tourism focuses upon minimizing impact upon the socio-cultural as well as the natural environment, involves a high ratio of local labour force thereby taking a community based approach, and fosters positive interaction between the tourist and his environment. As per the policy for the diversification of tour ism product of India, special attention is being given for the development of Adventure Tourism in the country. The Ministry of Tourism has also issued guidelines for approval of Adventure Tour Operators, which is a voluntary scheme, open to all bonafide adventure tour operators. Central Financial Assistance is being extended to various State Government / Union Territory Administration for development of Tourism infrastructure in destinations including Adventure Tourism destinations. The Ministry has also aligned its Sustainable Tourism Criteria for India (STCI) to the Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria (GSTC). On the marketing and promotion front, the Incredible India campaign has increased the use of the adventure and nature based products in its campaigns, and has facilitated road shows in target markets like Australia and New Zealand. From a policy perspective, the Ministry of Tourism has certification guidelines in place, which focus upon the service delivery with added emphasis on safety guidelines and environmental conservation issues. The application and approval mechanisms are easily accessible and the approved list of operators can be found in the public domain. The 'Hunar Se Rozgar' scheme of the Ministry of Tourism under the umb rella of Capacity Building for Service Providers (CBSP) scheme has also contemplated programs under various heads to consolidate human resource for the adventure tourism sector. In 2009, the Ministry of Defence gave permission for opening of 104 additional peaks in Leh area of Jammu & Kashmir for adventure tourism. Himachal Pradesh was awarded as the 'Best State for Adventure Tourism Destination' in 2012. The Government is currently implementing various tourism development projects with an assistance of INR 482.22 crore from Asian Development Bank, where developing adventure tourism to international standards with a focus to attract foreign tourists is a key component. The Great Himalayan National Park has also now been nominated for World Natural Heritage Site status. Film Tourism Film tourism includes both film production and shooting and film- induced tourism activities.Both the production and distribution processes involve extensive travel in terms of duration as well as the volume of people travelling and the necessary logistics. This is where the Film Promotion Boards as well as the Tourism Promotion Boards need to pitch their offers to the filmmakers. In most of the developed economies across America and Europe, Destination Management Organizations (DMOs) are increasingly playing a key role in facilitating film shooting and managing the spillover effects, which also ensures minimization of economic leakages. International film festivals showcase the natural wealth of the countries and also the management and governance of the social infrastructure of the place. These film festivals are utilized as important forums to showcase the natural wealth of the co untry.As per the policy for the diversification of tourism product of India, special attention is being given for the development of Adventure Tourism in the country. The Ministry of Tourism has also issued guidelines for approval of Adventure Tour Operators, which is a voluntary scheme, open to all bonafide adventure tour operators. Central Financial Assistance is being extended to various State Government / Union Territory Administration for development of Tourism infrastructure in destinations including Adventure Tourism destinations.22 YOJANA May 2015The Conduit of Co-Production Co-production between two countries is when the content is treated as a national property in both the nations and therefore is allowed to claim tax benefits or rebates. India has co-production agreements with Germany, Italy, UK, New Zealand, Brazil and France.Now it is possible to walk in with a script and return with a canned film.Permissions can be granted to overseas film producers in a short span of even three weeks. Owing to improved infrastructure and support system which also includes around 10 post production labs with latest technologies, India is also a preferred centre for post-production due to the abundance of English speaking technical manpower. It is already witnessed that in animation software, India is now recognized as a globally preferred outsourcing hub. Besides these comparative advantages, India clearly stands out as a cost-effective and one of the most economical countries for shooting and post-production activities. There are ready options for talented artists and technicians to execute the visions. From director of photography to set designers, all remain at the beck and call of the producer. India itself stands out a 1000-film a year industry. And the legal regime in India is supreme. Working is also possible through the government backed National Film Development Corporation or some local line company. Industrial bodies like PHD Chamber, ASSOCHAM or FICCI can compile a rating list of line companies in India as a reference guide to be made available in various High Commissions. Government Support and Policy Initiatives Taking account of the socio- economic as well as the cultural significance of films from the Indian diaspora, the Central Government has granted 'industry' status to the film sector, and many states have been offering tax rebates and other incentives to filmmakers. To give a fillip to the 'Incredible India' campaign and cinema as a sub-brand of Incredible India at various international film festivals and markets abroad, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and Ministry of Tourism signed a memorandum of Understanding in 2012 to provide support for film tourism. The Ministry of Tourism also extends financial support to State Governments and Union Territory Administrations for promoting Film Tourism under its Central Financial Assistance (CFA) scheme. There is also a focus on tapping International Film Festivals to promote the country, and events like International Film Festival of Kerala, Chennai International Film Festival, Kolkata International Film Festival & Mumbai Film Festival to promote film projects in their states. The North Eastern Region (NER) of India accounts 7.9 per cent of India's geographical area and 3.8 per cent of Indian population. Despite its fantabul ous bounty towards tourism, tourist movement remains largely neglected; Assam being an exception. T his lopsided public interest must be addressed with proper awareness campaigns and popularization initiatives. In 2016, Foreign Tourist Arrivals are projected to be 11.24 million, Domestic Tourist Visits to be 1451.46 million, Foreign Exchange Earning to be US $ 330.3 billion and total employment contribution to be 24.5 million. It is necessary to have a synergistic, multi-institution focussed approach towards identification, planning and development of tourism products and services, in collaboration with Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of culture and other related ministries, having heritage as the core driver of tourism industry in the country .

Whatever might be the supply and potential of resources, nothing happens until all those resources are judiciously put into use by an entrepreneur. Thus, it is appropriate to describe an entrepreneur as a agent of change and catalyst. Entrepreneurs are known for their vision, drive and talent, who are adept in identifying opportunities and exploiting them for the good of the society. Entrepreneurs endow economic value to the resources. To quote Peter Drucker (2009) \"every mineral is another rock and every plant is another weed, till someone finds a use\". They add to the material well being of nations through their relentless endeavours. To quote George Gilder, \"All of us are dependent for our livelihood and progress on the creativity and courage of the particular men/ women who accept the risks which generate our riches\". Entrepreneurship and Economic Development As Meier and Baldwin have put it, \"Developme nt does not The author is Senior Professor of Tourism in the School of Management of Pondicherry Central University.

In this context, it may be noted that tourism as an industry has taken off and is growing at an impressive rate all over the world. In the service industry, tourism proved to be a better bet, thanks to the various virtues like the need for low capital and easy to set up businesses. T h e r e f o r e , t h e s c o p e f o r entrepreneurship is relatively more in the tourism sector, given the wide range of services to be provided to the tourists. Tourism entrepreneurship, therefore, involves all commercial activities spread across the whole spectrum of tourism and allied sectors. These include transportation, hotels and catering, travel agencies, tour operators, entertainment, production and marketing of works of arts and crafts, conferences/events and exhibitions, management of parks and other recreation places. Innovative Tourism Products - Key to Future Growth The fact that innovative tourism products hold the key for the success and sustenance of Indian tourism needs no emphasis. In spite of the YOJANA May 2015 25widely acclaimed benefits of tourism, the initiatives of the government and develop mental agencies to take Indian tourism to the next level are far from satisfactory. Not many new tourism destinations worth mentioning have been developed in the last several decades. As a result, the pressure on the existing tourism destinations is increasing by the day with improvements in the road network, transport options, telecommunication facilities and a steep increase in the incomes of the tourism customers apart from the changes in the lifestyles and preferences. Therefore, it is high time that new product/ destination development is paid greater attention now than before. Following are some of the initiatives which may catapult Indian tourism into a new orbit. Promotion of unique/ Mystery Spots Unlike the west, where some unique spots which defy nature and logic are promoted vigorously, India is yet to identify its mystery spots and market them. For instance, Jatinga near Haflong in Assam where birds from far off counties arrive during September - November every year and hit a specified ridge there and commit suicide. It is a mystery indeed! Similarly, a water pond in Mahanandi in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh where the water level is constant throughout the year. The tank here is 1.5 m (5ft) deep. The mystery is that no one knows how the water enters the tank - and that it is always the same level and crystal clear. The fact that water is so pure and clear where even a small coin also is very clearly visible from the top further compounds the mystery. Another mystery spot worth mentioning could be the Bhangarh Fort near Alwar in Rajasthan, said to be one of the most haunted sites in the world. Yet another place is Shani Signapur in Maharashtra where the houses in the entire village are without doors, leave alone lock s. Legend goes that there is a strong belief among the people there that if anybody steals anything, he/ she is severely punished by the God. Too strange to believe in the contemporary society! All these exciting and strange destinations offer tremendous potential from the tourism perspective. Exploitation of these resources calls for entrepreneurship. Product design, strengthening accessibility, accommodation and other tourist friendly facilities need to be put in place. All these places which are known in the respective regions may be put on a larger canvas such that the curiosity, mystery surrounding these places and the folklore of these places offer Unique Selling Propositions (USP). Therefore, it is high time that appropriate emphasis may be laid on unconventional tourism products like these are included in the National/ State tourism policies. Promotion of Less Known Destinations Given the size of the nation and the diversities, there are many attractions with a huge potential which needs to be exploited and put across the National Tourism Map. For instance, the Pulicat lake and the Bird Sanctuary in Nellore district of And hra Pradesh (150 km from Chennai), the scenic beauty of Muppanae in Karnataka with good camping facilities, Parambikulam Eco tourism spot abutting the famous Top Slip, Meghamalai in Theni district in Tamilnadu - a haven for trekkers are just a few attractions which are second to none, though ironically are not known much in the tourism circles, barring a few Special interest Tourists . Similarly, Lambhasingi near Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh is one place which receives snowfall every year in the whole of South India needs a special mention. It is obvious that there are several places across the country awaiting this kind of attention. Accessible Tourism It is an irony that compared to the products of manufacturing sector, the service sector, more particularly, the tourism sector is yet to realize and appreciate the specific needs of the people with disabilities. While nations and the various productive sectors all over the world are harping on 'inclusive Growth' tirelessly, tourism sector seems to be lagging behind with respect to the concern for differently abled people. It may be noted that the urge to visit various places of interest, explore and experience the myriad variations of nature are basic human instincts. It is disheartening that the specific needs of a sizable section of disabled people, whose number is estimated to be more than 600 million around the world, are not taken cognizance of in an organised fashion. Apart from meeting the social objectives like equity and social justice, the size of the market truly provides enormous opportunities for new investment in terms of product design and development. According to European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), accessible tourism includes creation or modification of infrastructural facilities like: barrier free destination, hassle free transport, high quality services, participation in activities and exhibits, convenience in accessing and handling transactions with respect to booking systems and other service acquisition tasks. Product design, strengthening accessibility, accommodation and other tourist friendly facilities need to be put in place. All these places which are known in the respective regions may be put on a larger canvas such that the curiosity, mystery surrounding these places and the folklore of these places offer Unique Selling Propositions (USP). Therefore, it is high time that appropriate emphasis may be laid on unconventional tourism products like these are included in the National/ State tourism policies.26 YOJANA May 2015Thanks to the internet, online travel planning and booking have become more accessible to all the segments. However, the facilities at travel terminals and the destinations leave much to be desired. Pro- Poor Tourism Visiting places, meeting people, enjoying the scenic beauty and savouring different cuisines are natural human instincts, and are economic status, domicile, gender and age neutral. However, willingly or unwillingly, Indian tourism over the years evolved itself to focus on the urban rich and elite. If the trend continues, no wonder it may soon be described as, \"Tourism of the elite, by the elite and for the elite\"! Inspite of huge development in the tourism infrastructure with respect to transport, accommodation and other services, vast section of the Indian society from the rural and semi urban places are still outside the tourism experience. It is an irony that while products from manufacturing sector could effectively reach out to the rural markets even in remote places, tourism as a product is yet to be promoted in an all inclusive fashion ! Nothing could better capture the potential of rural and unexplored markets for tourism than C.K. Prahalad's popular theme, 'Fortune at the bottom of the pyramid'! Therefore, it is high time that rural markets are explored. Change in the attitude, tourism product development at affordable cost, a warm welcome approach for involvement and participation of the rural folks are some of the issues to be addressed. Excepting some popular pilgrim centers across the country, all other tourism products are comparatively missing out on this huge rural tourism market. Excursion/ Tour Packages for Students It is quite intriguing that no major tour operator/ travel portal has any product in their product mix designed to suit the specific need s of students of schools/ colleges. It is anybody's knowledge that now- a- days, almost all the education institutions organize short excursion trips/ study tours/ industry visits. Given the size of the nation, number of institutions and the growing enrollment of students, the size of the market is so huge and is waiting to be tapped in an organised fashion. This market is usually served by bit players in the industry, largely from the unorganized sector and in an unprofessional way, quite often at the cost of safety and security of the students in their trips. A case in point is the tragedy where 24 engineering college students from Hyderabad lost their lives due to sudden upsurge of water in the Beas river let out from Larji Hydro Electric Project downstream. Cases of cheating and exploitation are also not few and far between. The teachers who plan with the help of student representatives may not have the professional expertise to design the tour schedules in terms of fool proof itineraries, cost effectiveness and contingency plans to meet unexpected events. As a result, stranded groups of students at many bus and railway stations with dislocated schedules and stress ridden faces are a common sight. Man- Made Tourism Resources With thousands of kilometers of vast coastlines on both East and West, it is disheartening to note that not much is heard about beach tourism. Excepting Goa on the west coast and Puri beach on the east coast in the countr y, we cannot boast of beaches internationally known. Of course, there are several beaches of different hues all along the coast line, largely catering to the local/regional markets. There is ample space and scope for the promotion of at least half a dozen world class beach tourism destinations with less investment. Water sports are another tourism product which is crying for attention. Theme/Amusement parks Theme and Amusement parks are manmade tourism attractions, though involving larger capital outlays which cater to the tourists of all ages and orientations. At the present pace, it is anybody's wonder as to how many years the nation will take to have any theme park close to Disneyland, though not similar! When Universal Studios of USA could fully leverage its Hollywood moorings, equally renowned in terms of history and spread, Mumbai Bollywood studios and studios in Chennai and Hyderabad are yet to make significant strides. Any initiative in this regard will be an instant hit given the film crazy population. The role played by Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad deserves all the praise in this regard. Bombay and Chennai could also leverage their film studios and rich film heritage. Time to Act All these innovative business opportunities offer tremendous potential from the tourism perspective. Exploitation of these resources depends on the entrepreneurial spirit and a culture that accepts tourists with open arms, true to the Indian spirit of \" Atithi Devo Bhava \"! Product design, strengthening accessibility, accommodation and other tourist friendly facilities need to be streamlined/improved. Each place has its beauty and specialty which could be marketed .Identifying the Unique Selling Propositions (USP) is an art and is a function of entrepreneurial ingen uity. Therefore, ...innovative business opportunities offer tremendous potential from the tourism perspective. Exploitation of these resources depends on the entrepreneurial spirit and a culture that accepts tourists with open arms, true to the Indian spirit of \"Atithi Devo Bhava\"! YOJANA May 2015 27it is high time that ap propriate emphasis is laid on unconventional tourism products and are included in the National/ State tourism policies for promotion and development.

The portal https://ncvtmis.dget.i n developed by the Ministry's Directorate General of Employment & Training(DGE&T), will help to monitor delivery and performance of government schemes. In its first phase, the NCVT-MIS portal has provided an e-governance mechanism for key DGE&T schemes such as the Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS) and Apprentice Protsahan Yojana (APY). The portal provides information to the general public on details of various institutions in the country for Craftsman Trade Scheme, Apprenticeship scheme and Craftsman Instructor training scheme, their affiliation details, number of seats available and their utilization statistics. Details of 11000 + Industrial Training Institutes (ITI) along with their affiliation details are available for search in the public domain. Data of about 10 lakh CTS candidates, who took admission across these ITIs in the country during the session starting August 14, are now available in the portal. The trainees can now print hall ticket, mark sheet and e-certificates from the portal themselves which will eliminate harassment in issuance of these documents and also drastically reduce the turnaround time in availability of these documents. The employers will also be able to validate these e-certificates directly using the portal. Over 20 lakh certified trainees who were given paper based certificates can also be verified online. Similarly under APY , the portal digitizes the entire business process of the scheme and allows registration for establishments, submission and approval of claims, and payment to establishments and subsequently to apprentices being processed electronically through direct benefit transfer. A helpdesk has also been provisioned for handholding the ITI during the rollout of the portal across all the institutes along with user manuals, FAQ and training sessions. The portal is designed to provide visibility into the supply of training, employment, and apprenticeship services of the Ministry, help catalyse the demand for these services through better market information and advocacy, and also provide a self-service internet portal to help different stakeholders conduct several business functions online. With over 11000+ ITI spread across the country with 134 different trades of varying durations and size and 10 lakh students enrolling every year in these ITIs, it had become virtually impossible for DGET to ensure policy and affiliation compliance and timely result declaration without a MIS system. The portal is also expected to improve the governance of vocational training across the field institutions of DGE&T by providing high degree of transparency, better analytics for decision making, and improved access to citizen services. In its phase II currently under development, the platform will also provide modules for the Centrally funded institutes which conduct instructor training courses , apprenticeship services and to help the States in migrating the admission process for various vocational training courses online, provide a centralized database of instructors in the country for such courses, and also provide an integration with the National Career Service (NCS) portal of the DGE&T to integrate the training services with employment and Aadhaar. During the launch , e-certificates were awarded from the first set of e-certificates generated from portal for candidates who had successfully completed trainings from various Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) in the past, but were awaiting certification by the NCVT due to a huge backlog of data transmission from States to DGE&T. About 1.6 lakh pending e-certificates have been generated through the portal for already passed out trainees. PRAGATI: a multi-purpose, multi-modal platform for Pro-Active Governance And Timely Implementation The Prime Minister launched the ambitious multi-purpose and multi-modal platform PRAGATI (Pro-Active Governance And Timely Implementation) on 25th March, 2015. PRAGATI is a unique integrating and interactive platform. The platform is aimed at addressing common man's grievances, and simultaneously monitoring and reviewing important programmes and projects of the Government of India as well as projects flagged by State Governments. The PRAGATI platform uniquely bundles three latest technologies: Digital data management, video-conferencing and geo-spatial technology. It also offers a unique combination in the direction of cooperative federalism since it brings on one stage the Secretaries of Government of India and the Chief Secretaries of the States. With this, the Prime Minister is able to discuss the issues with the concerned Central and State officials with full information and latest visuals of Development Roadmap 30 YOJANA May 2015the ground level situation. Such an effort has never been made in India. It is also an innovative project in e-governance and good governance. Key features of the PRAGATI application are as follows: It is a three-tier system (PMO, Union Government Secretaries, and Chief Secretaries of the States); Prime Minister will hold a monthly programme where he will interact with the Government of India Secretaries, and Chief Secretaries through Video-conferencing enabled by data and geo-informatics visuals; The first such programme was launched on 25th March, 2015 (Wednesday) at 3.30 PM; It will be held once in every month on Fourth Wednesday at 3.30 PM-to be known as PRAGATI Day. Issues to be flagged before the PM are picked up from the available database regarding Public Grievances, on-going Programmes and pending Projects; The system will ride on, strengthen and re-engineer the data bases of the CPGRAMS for grievances, Project Monitoring Group (PMG) and the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. PRAGATI provides an interface and platform for all these three aspects. It will also take into consideration various correspondences to PM's office by the common people or from high dignitaries of States and/or developers of public projects; The issues flagged are uploaded seven days prior to the PRAGATI day (i.e. on third Wednesday of every month). These issues can be viewed by the Union Government Secretaries and Chief Secretaries after entering into the application; User ID and Password for each of the Union Government Secretaries and Chief Secretaries have been created and made available; Union Government Secretaries and Chief Secretaries will be able to see the issues pertaining to their Department /State; Union Government Secretaries and Chief Secretaries have to put their comments and updates about the flagged issues within three days (i.e. by next Monday); One day - Tuesday is available to the PMO team to review the data entered by the Union Government Secretaries and Chief Secretaries; The design is such, that when PM reviews the issue he should have on his screen the issue as well as the latest updates and visuals regarding the same; The system has been designed in-house by the PMO team with the help of National Informatics Center (NIC). As the name suggests, it is aimed at starting a culture of Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation. It is also a robust system for bringing e-transparency and e-accountability with real-time presence and exchange among the key stakeholders. YE-17/2015YOJANA May 2015 31Role of Tourism in Economic Development CrEaTING braND INDIa aNalySIS Prem Subramaniam I In the recent times, there has been a tendency to coin new themes without adequate background work on identifying source markets, the competitive environment, the cost of reaching the ultimate consumer and the ability to move them along the Communication Life Cycle. This is a core component of marketing and requires a well orchestrated strategy to generate awareness, create interest and desire, prompt action and provide an outstanding experience to encourage repeat visits and strongly recommend the destination. The Incredibly India campaign achieved the awareness creation remarkable well and it is about time that the rest of the CLC is delivered to get meaningful businessNDIA IS yet to realize realize its true potential of vitalizing its tourism a s s e t s t o m a k e a significant contribution to the country's economic development with inclusive growth. The 12 th Plan document represented a significant departure from a primary focus on international tourist arrivals and foreign exchange earnings being the principal objective and attempts to integrate the role of tourism in accordance with the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals conceptualized by the United Nations World Tourism Organization. According to the 12 th Plan document, \"Tourism has the potential to help achieve the objectives of the Twelfth Plan for faster, more inclusive, and sustainable growth. More importantly, it is a powerful antidote to poverty. It eliminates the disadvantage of market inaccessibility suffered by the poor in respect of their goods and services by bringing the consu mer to their doorstep. This reduces the need for intermediation thereby The author is presently consultant with Ernst & Young for evolving tourism inputs for assignment of Swarna Andhra 2029 for the State Government.

However, the potential can be fully realised only if the international competitiveness of the Indian tourism sector improves significantly by removing both the supply and demand constraints. India has a large domestic tourism market too, in addition to international travellers. A variety of products and price points required to realise the country's large domestic tourism potential must be developed. Standard, international products will not be able to open up this market. Indeed, even foreign tourists to India come for a variety of experiences, from luxurious to the simple and spiritual. This would require innovations in products. Therefore, on the supply side, it is necessary to identify new tourism products and create destinations and circuits around them by a comprehensive physical and financial plan through a community participatory process. This would have to be complemented by building the necessary human resource skills for servicing the tourist. Similarly, on the demand side, a multi-pronged effective tourism marketing strategy would need to be adopted to eliminate 32 YOJANA May 2015(India Tourism Statistics at a Glance - 2013) If we extrapolate this data, and match against the HVS FHRAI Annual Survey, it would appear that the organized hotel sector handles less than 20 per cent of the international traffic and barely 0.05 per cent of the domestic market. If this is true, then bringing the unorganized sector within the regulatory framework should be a critical component of our tourism process. If we look at the way other countries present their tourism statistics and the details included, we have a long way to go, though there has been a reasonable improvement with regard to international tourism data collection. We collect a lot of information at various stages of a tourist's visit, but these do not seem to be integrated to deliver a correct perspective of the status of the sector. We hide more than we reveal. Of the 120 odd monuments which are ticketed and under ASI jurisdiction, the visitation by international tourists is around 3 million and about 46 million by domestic tourists according to 2012 data. Of the top ten monuments visited by foreigners, seven are in Delhi and Agra and account for 65 per cent of tickets sold. It would be safe to assume that a first time visitor to Delhi and Agra woul d include at least five of these seven monuments and so if we use the figures for the Taj, the If one were to ask an average resident of a city in India when they visited a museum in their own city last, the chances are that the answer would be one of either, not after school, or only when they had to accompany a visitor.Yet the Akshardham Temple at Delhi demonstrates that it is possible to hold the attention of a resident of Delhi with a good visitor management programme.information asymmetry and create brand India. Since pricing is an important determinant in the choice of an international destination, the tourists cannot be excessively burdened with statutory levies and taxes. Therefore, taxation of tourism should be rationalized in conformity with the best international practices. The responsibilities for implementing the comprehensive plan for development of tourist circuits and building brand India is fragmented vertically across levels of governments and horizontally across the private and public sector. Hence, it is imperative to establish a transparent and effective policy and regulatory framework; create the appropriate incentive structure; and institute a coordination mechanism to synergise the activities of different stakeholders. The gross budgetary support for the Twelfth Five Year Plan (2012-17) for the Ministry of Tourism is `15,190 crores that excludes IEBR of 155 crore.\" While the credentials of our planning process have always been of acceptable global standards, we have rarely been able to deliver on the promise of tourism as their implementation is woefully poor. A universally accepted Mantra for good governance is to have a robust measurement and evaluation criteria and we have clearly not internalized \"What can not be measured,can not be managed\". Let us take the example of room nights at approved hotels and the correlation with tourist statistics revealed by the Ministry of Tourism. The number of approved hotel rooms in India was a mere 76,858 in 1,242 hotels at the end of 2013. So, at full occupancy, the available room nights works out to 76,858x365 translating to about 28 million. We are said to have received 7 million overseas tourists and handled 1147 million domestic travellers. The international tourists spent Rs.51,587 crores and this works out to a per tourist spend of Rs 73,700. conclusion would be that less than a milli on of the international traffic visits at least one monument and the number of leisure international tourists to Delhi and Agra is not greater than 0.4 million with another 0.3 million just doing a visit to Agra probably on a business trip. So if our USP is our built heritage, why is the visitation so poor? The resounding answer one is likely to receive is that the interpretation is pathetic, the facilities to spend additional money on eating, shopping, entertainment, enjoying participative activities at heritage sites is non- existent. We have some outstanding guides but the majority of them rely on shopping commissions specially in Delhi and Agra and as a result, deliver a very poor visitor experience. ASI acts as a regulator operating according to guidelines established over a hundred years ago and has a penchant for artificial green lawns barricaded, irrespective of site characteristics. Has the interpretation improved because of the advent of technology? The National Museum at Delhi and Mehrangarh Fort at Jodhpur are rare exceptions which have not served as inspiration to others. If one were to ask an average resident of a city in India that when they visited a museum in their own city last, the chances are that the answer would be one of either, not after school, or only when they had to accompany a visitor.Yet the Akshardham Temple at Delhi demonstrates that it is possible to hold the attention of a resident of Delhi with a good visitor management programme. A very large proportion of the budgetary allocation is spent on promotion and publicity including participation at international travel marts and maintaining offices at source markets. Do w e really have a measure of whether we are getting YOJANA May 2015 33the right bang for our bucks? The preparatory work prior to going for a travel mart is inadequate and there are no focused appointments resulting in broad PR . How many new tour operators in each source market offer a published itinerary on India? Number of scheduled departures? Group size? Increase in the number of itineraries featured? Who are we trying to target in our TV campaigns? Is it just an easy way to spend allocated budgets? How many increased enquiries resulted? How many of these translated into business? How good are our websites and is there a seamless link with book-ability? How active is our use of social media? Does our giving hospitality to media partners now embrace bloggers? Do we know enough about source markets and segments within these source markets and are our efforts targeted at these segments through partnerships with trade and non tourism partners? The difference between Kerala and Goa with regard to numbers,mode of travel,local employment and other critical components is stark evidence of the need to appeal to the Alert Independent Traveller rather than rely solely on charter traffic for beach tourism. The resentment of the local population in Goa to the development of capital intensive hotels was assuaged by allowing shacks during the peak season.This has, however, made Goa, a cheap charter destination and increased the negative impacts of tourism with an increase in crime, drugs and prostitution. Kerala's evolution from a two-day component of a larger India itinerary to an inclusive tour within the state with a dispersion of traffic is a shining example of how to overcome the issues of regional spread and seasonal spread.The Kerala Travel Mart is a good example of partnership for promotional activity aimed at influencing overseas trade partners. The \" Chasing the Monsoon\" initiative with the media to promote tourism during the lean monsoon months too, is a great initiative. If China is emerging as the number one source market, what specific steps have we taken to get a piece of this market? In fact, Sri Lanka had a clearly articulated plan to promote Ramayana trails which was announced during the visit of our PM recently. Our planning is product focused and not market lead. Perceptions about safety and security in India is reflected in the sharp fall of leisure tourists to the NCR region. There are concerns about sanitation, hygiene and cleanliness and the 12 th Plan document too raises the need to address these. An outstanding example of uplifting the standard of public toilets was initiated at Delhi thanks to the relentless efforts of Fuad Lokhandwala with the support of the municipal authorities of the city. While the use of Aamir Khan to create awareness of tourist behavior through a TV campaign has been effective , its impact on actual behavior has room for a tremendous surge and this can be done through linkages on social media. Our supply chain integration too has to be strengthened to clearly demonstrate the benefit of tourism to the farming sector. This has been attempted in Kerala through the Kudumbashree Initiative but the footprint needs to be more dispersed. The benefit of tourism is that it can create economic activity in fragile, remote areas with relatively poor infrastructure and generate local employment amongst a wide spectrum of people with varying skill sets. This too has been mentioned in the 12 th Plan document in detail with facilities for skill development at an institutional level. Grants have been made available under the 'Hunar Se Rozgar' scheme and a robust roll out of this would be a boon to add incremental value to farm incomes. The Ministry of Tourism carried out an initiative with UNDP at 39 rural sites but less than 15 per cent of these have proved to be resilient enough to continue after the grants were consumed. Tourism is a fiercely competitive business and perceptions about the value proposition are crucial to get the right tourists. Tourism being perceived as an island of luxury in a sea of poverty has lead to very high taxes at every level and in the short term, this has not got rationalized. As an example, the taxes and other levies on a meal in a Five Star hotel offering live entertainment is nearly 40 per cent without the attendant benefits of power, water and waste management being provided. Likewise, despite very high interstate taxes for tourist vehicles, the highway amenities are inadequate. Standards do require a paradigm change to meet the aspirations of the new emerging traveller and the fact that the outbound market is surging suggests that the urban Indian prefers the international destinations to traveling within India. Skill development, capacity building and quality assurance programmes are therefore, as critical as relevant infrastructure. Infrastructure needs to be viewed in th e context of delivering The benefit of tourism is that it can create economic activity in fragile, remote areas with relatively poor infrastructure and generate local employment amongst a wide spectrum of people with varying skill sets. This too has been mentioned in the 12th Plan document in detail with facilities for skill development at an institutional level. Grants have been made available under the 'Hunar Se Rozgar' scheme and a robust roll out of this would be a boon to add incremental value to farm incomes. 34 YOJANA May 2015an accepta ble standard rather than meeting some mythical \"world class\" criteria. The investment climate to attract both local and overseas entrepreneurs has room for improvement. Currently, there is interest only in business hotels at key cities with an IT bias. The land banks made available are dispersed. Most well planned cities try and integrate the confluence of culture, cuisine, crafts in a campus environment. Common services such as parking, waste management, power back up, and provision of potable water too can be provided to justify the taxes that are levied. It will also make the task of prefeasibility reports easier. The permissions for fulfilling the legal requirements could be carried out in advance. This will reduce the time taken to complete the projects by at least 25 per cent, improving the viability. Any strategy requires appropriate organizational structure for effective implementation. Unfortunately, this has not happened in India. While the relationship between the centre and the state is clearly defined, the need to have Tourism Councils at the district level has not been carried out with adequate transparency. India is one of the few countries where there is no functional structure with the induction of professionals on a contractual basis. Tourism requires a strong co-ordination at inter ministerial levels as the customer experience is dependent on visas, air passage, health regulations, import restrictions, which come under the jurisdiction of home, civil aviation, health, finance, environment and commerce ministries. The Visa on Arrival is a welcome demonstration of a coordinated effort. In recent times, there has been a tendency to coin new themes without adequate background work on identifying source markets, the competitive environment, the cost of reaching the ultimate consumer and the ability to move them along the Communication Life Cycle. This is a core component of marketing and requires a well orchestrated strategy to generate awareness, create interest and desire, prompt action and provide an outstanding experience to encourage repeat visits and strongly recommend the destination. The 'Incredible India' campaign achieved the awareness creation remarkably well and it is about time that the rest of the CLC is delivered to get meaningful business. Winning awards is laudable but getting relevant business is certainly more desirable. Like cricket and cinema, in tourism too, there are many self styled experts in India whose cacophony drowns the measured views of knowledgeable professionals. It would be apt if this platform provides the impetus to encourage a dialogue amongst a Diaspora of individuals with a diversity of backgrounds to weave an i mplementation strategy of the recomme ndations of the 12 th Plan document. q (E-mail:premsubramaniam@yahoo.com )Ph.: 011-45633700, Mob.: 9899154622,8130153699 Indian Heritage and Culture, History of the World Indian National Movement, Geography, Environment Bio-Diversity & Ecology (With Special Focus on Current Issues) ADMISSION Will also coverP BATCH STARTS 27th APRIL OPEN Paper III Topics1.

India's top- rated education system is not only churning out computer programmers and engineers, but an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 doctors and nurses each year. The current market growth-rate is around 30 per cent per year and the country is inching closer to major players like Singapore and Thailand. Medical tourism will help create 40 million new jobs over the next few yearsO U R I S M , CONV ENTIONALLY , is defined as visiting places other than where you live, for leisure, recreation and other reasons for a short duration. However over the years, the word \"Tourism\" has not been simply limited to leisure and recreation. In the last few decades with improving health awareness, infrastructure and ever growing expertise in the field of medicine has led to the development called, 'Medical Tourism'. A term coined by travel agencies and mass media to address the rapid growth of Health and Tourism industry, it is a phenomenon, where people from all around the world travel to a different country (in this case, India) to obtain medical, dental, and surgical care while at the same time touring and vacationing, enjoying the several attractions that the country has to offer. Medical tourism, especially in India has various fields of modern, traditional and alternative medicine. They are classified as follows: Modern/ Allopathy Medicine: In addition to oral medication, it includes surgeries like -joint replacements, organ transplants, diagn ostic tests, cosmetic surgeries, muti -specialty The author has been working as a medical professional for the past 34 years. Apart from practicing Family Physician, he has also contributed to field of public health as a consultant. His experiences include\u2014 setting up Sri Krishna Medical Centre, directing the Sehyog, a project on Juvenile de-addiction, and coordinating the \"Drinking and Driving Intervention Project\" in partnership with Delhi Legal Service Authority and corporate House Jindal Photos Limited. He was also the Chief Executive, Indian Alcohol Policy Alliance- a global partner of Global Alcohol Policy Alliance (GAPA), U.K. and affiliated with FORUT Norway. care and treatment of Infertility, Hematology or di seases related to blood and blood vessels. Furthermore, it also encompasses, dental implants and orthodontic care, laser hair removal, hair transplant and lastly, spa and beauty treatments. Ayurveda: Ayurveda has been a unique health care system indigenous to the country since 600 BC. Ayurveda is a branch of medicine, completely based on a \"naturalistic system\", depending on the diagnosis of the body's ailments to achieve the right balance. This natural method of rejuvenation and overcoming ailment has gained significant popularity in the recent times. Yoga: Yoga is derived from the Sanskrit word 'Yog' which means 'union,' presumably union with the divine being or God. It is a physiological and spiritual discipling, comprising of a secular and scientific methodology to experience the integration of the mind-body-spirit. India is known as the country where Yoga & Meditation are a way of life. Other Alternative Medicines includes Homeopathy, Naturopathy, Meditation and Music Therapy, Aroma Therapy, Pranic Healing and Reiki. 36 YOJANA May 2015Given the number of options and oppor tunities available in India, medical tourism is one of the quickest and largest growing industries in the country as well as the world. As the number of uninsured people and those with high deductibles continues to go up, many of them opt to be treated outside their native land, where they can manage to pay for the treatments. Medical Tourism in India offers low cost, or cost effective medical treatment with no waiting lists and accessibility of skilled and renowned medical experts, allowing medical tourists from all over the world an easy access. At present, the expectation is that Medical Tourism will continue to grow up at a rapid rate of speed and continue offering medical treatments to tourist at a fraction of the cost they can get at home. In addition to medical tourism, India is considered among the best in international tourist destinations. India with its present slogan \"Atithi Devo Bhava\" , which means that a guest is equivalent to a god, assures service providers to provide end-to end services. These include\u2014 specialty treatment, treatment-cum-leisure destination, low-cost consultation and treatment, no waiting period for treatment and availability of advanced equipments. Maximum tourists arrive from Africa, CIS countries, Middle East, Afghanistan, Iraq and Bangladesh. The inflow, however, is a lot less from developed nations in Europe and North America. Currently, a large number of patients primarily come for Angioplasty, Cardiac Surgeries, Joint replacement, Eye surgery including Cataract, Organ transplant including Liver and Kidney, IVF, Cancer treatment besides many other difficult to treat conditions. This quality health care comes with ultra modern fully equipped tertiary hospitals, growing insurance market, and strong presence of the pharmaceutical industries. Other key government players include\u2014 Ministry of Heath and Family Welfare and the Ministry of Tourism. According to Indian Medical/ Health Touris m Service Sector Network Report Sector Overview and SWOT Analysis, within the initiative, Sustainable Industrial Networks and its applications on Micro Regional Environmental Planning (SINET) India with advanced medical services, paired with exotic natural bounties has become a heaven for medical tourists. The Medical Tourism Industry in India is poised to be the next big success story after software. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and McKinsey have predicted that the industry will grow to earn additional revenue for up market tertiary hospitals and will account for 3-5 per cent of the total healthcare delivery market. The Indian medical tourism industry, growing at an annual rate of 30 per cent, caters to patients chiefly from the West Asia, Middle East Africa and to some extent from US and Europe. Although in its nascent stage, the industry is outsmarting similar industries of other countries such as Greece, South Africa, Jordan, Malaysia, Philippines and Singapore. India's National Health Policy declares that treatment of foreign patients is legally an \"export\" and deemed \"eligible for all fiscal incentives extended to export earnings.\" Government and private sector studies in India estimate that medical tourism could bring between 1 billion and 2 billion (1.25 billion Euros and 2.50 billion E uros) into the country. Fiscal reports from different sources estimate that medical tourism to India is growing by 30 per cent a year. It is expected that by the year 2015, India will receive an annual turnout of more than one and a half million dollars. India's top-rated education system is not only churning out computer programmers and engineers, but an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 doctors and nurses each year. The current market growth-rate is around 30 per cent per year and the country is inching closer to major players like Singapore and Thailand. Medical tourism will help create 40 million new jobs over the next few years. The areas that are likely to witness huge growth in the coming years include: 1. Marketing - T h e l e a d i n g hospitals offering medical tourism market their services through the Internet, healthcare facilitators and sometimes, personal visits to patients abroad for which efficient marketing personnel are required. 2. Linguistic services - For patients coming from the non-English speaking European, African and West Asian countries, translators are critical since the patient needs to understand the protocols around their medical treatment. 3. Back office operations - The back office functions in medical tourism are as demanding on talent as they are in the other service industries with good communications and interpersonal skills being the baseline requirements. 4. Hospitality Professionals - While high end clinical acumen is the foundation for good healthcare, there is immense demand for service and managerial talent too. The main reason for India's emergence as a preferred destination is the inherent advantage of its healthcare industry. Today, Indian healthcare is perceived to be at par According to Indian Medical/Health Tourism Service Sector Network Report Sector Overview and SWOT Analysis, within the initiative Sustainable Industrial Networks and its applications on Micro Regional Environmental Planning (SINET) India with advanced medical services, paired with exotic natural bounties has become a heaven for medical tourists.

Conclusion This newfound need to travel internationally for medical and recreational purposes, has come to be known as \"Medical/Health Tourism\". More and more people are traveling outside their home country to get treatment for the ailments / disease they are suffering from. Cosmetic/ Aesthetic surgery has also attained an important reason for people to travel. Thus, a condition, which is not under the gambit of ailment, or disease has also come under the umbrella of Medical/ Health touris m.More and more people are traveling outside their home country to get treatment for the ailments / disease they are suffering from. Cosmetic/ Aesthetic surgery has also attained an important reason for people to travel. Thus a condition, which is not under the gambit of ailment, or disease has also come under the umbrella of Medical/ Health tourism.38 YOJANA May 2015Medi cal tourism is a big source for generating dollars irrespective of varying cost of treatment in different countries as, besides treatment, the consumer of health services has to spend on stay outside hospital for many disease conditions thus helping hotel and food industry. While going back home, the patients and their attendants also like to shop thus they contribute greatly towards the economy. In short, Medical Tourism not only helps to generate foreign currency, but also is a grand vehicle to market the country to citizens of different countries. The overall satisfying experience provided to the patient and his/her attendants invites and motivates others to travel to the country. India has carved a strong niche in the field of Medical Tourism over the years for the reasons of offering Medical Services of international standards at the lowest possible cost. India has a large pool of healthcare facilities of global standard and medical professionals par excellence besides highly trained and empathetic support staff. The country offers the best of treatment at cost, which is in many cases, less than 25 per cent of what one would spend in Europe or USA. Today, on an average, corporate sector hospitals treat over 15 per cent foreign patients of total patients they treat every year. This number runs into tens of thousands bringing huge much needed foreign exchange that may run into billions of dollars. Hospital chains like Apollo, Fortis, Max, a few are doing a yeoman's service to the nation by attracting patients from across the world and offering medical services equal to best anywhere in world. Despite the Medical Tourism in India growing at a fast pace, it still remains a highly unorganized sector where lots of middlemen with little or no knowledge and training to manage patient are playing havoc. A vast majority of middle men are touts, fleecing patients and attendants on every single service required thus causing harm to the visitor both financially and psychologically and despite best of treatment offered by hospital, the visitors does not have overall health / positive experience or they leave in a bad taste. In summation, it is high time to declare the Medical Tourism an Industry in India with well-defined guidelines with the goal to provide \"Winning Experience\" to visitors. Otherwise, this \"Sun Rise Industry\" with the potential to become over 100 billion dollars may end up as \"A Lost Opportunity\" that not only yields direct and indirect financial resources but also provides employment and is an excellent tool to propagate the good will of our nation. q (E-mail:hariharandr56@gmail.com ) YE-10/2015YOJANA May 2015 39INTERVIEW SESSION-2015 Vajiram & Ravi with its 38 years of rich experience recommits itself to guide candidates to appear before the Interview Board, with adequate Knowledge, confidence and composure with classroom, mock and personal sittings. INTERVIEW PROGRAMME BEGINS FROM 13th April, 2015 ONWARDS. ADMISSION IS OPEN. VAJIRAM & RAVI Institute for IAS Examination 9-B, KNOW? VISA The term VISA stands for the Visitors International Stay Admission. The word VISA is derived from Latin word charta visa, meaning a paper that has been seen. It is the legal permission granted to a person on some conditions by the competent authority of the country to which the person wishes to visit for a purpose and to stay there for a limited time and of which ,the visiting person is not a citizen. This official document is usually stamped or glued inside the passport. Mere granting of VISA doesn't guarantee entry. The immigration officials of the country to which the person is travelling need to see your passport before issuing a visa.If the visitor doesn't comply with their rules and regulations, then immigration officials have the authority to revoke your VISA any time. Every country typically has its own conditions for their visas, like the territory covered by the visa, duration of stay, purpose of the stay , dates of validity, whether the visa is valid for more than one visit, etc. Some countries might even demand to produce the return tickets and the source of money to cover their purpose to stay. Recently ,the Government of India has made changes to the types of Indian visas that it offers, particularly, the new restrictions that have been introduced for Tourist visas and x (Entry) visas.There are many types of VISA that is offered by our government to the tourists: Tourist Visa Tourist visas are granted to people whose purpose of coming to India to visit friends and sightseeing. The tourist visas can be granted for more than six months, depending on the applicant's nationality. However, it is not possible to remain in India for longer than six months at a time on a tourist visa. A gap of two months was required between visits to India but this condition was removed in late November 2012. Also, if you apply for another tourist visa within a month of expiration of your old one, the processing formalities can take up to 45 days as approval needs to be obtained from the Ministry of Home Affairs. Employment Visa Employment visas are issued to foreign nationals that are working in India, for an organization that is registered in India. Those who are involved in volunteering or interning work in India are granted employment visa s. Employment visas are usually given for duration of one year, or the term of the contract. But their duration can be extended in India. For obtaining an Employment visa, you'll need proof of employment with a company/organization in India, such as a contract that states the terms and conditions and that the applicants must be earning an income of $25,000 a year or more, except for volunteers, ethnic cooks, translators, non-English language teachers, and members of Foreign High Commissions and Embassies in India. Student Visa Student visa is granted to people who wish to come to India to study at an officially recognized educational institution like Vedic culture, Indian system of dance and music and yoga. Most often, the term Yoga Visa is mentioned which is actually a student visa granted to study yoga. It is noteworthy that for this the tourist visa will not suffice and the noted and well known yoga centres would ask for it. Business Visa Business visas are granted to foreign nationals who wish to venture into the business in India. But it is different from an Employment visa because in this case, the applicant would be neither working for, nor earning an income from any organization in India. People seeking a Business visa need to get a letter from the organization with which they want to get into the business bearing the details like the exact nature of the business, their stay during the business, the places that they will be visiting and how they will fund their expenses during their stay here. This type of visa has a validity of six months or more, with multiple entries. But as mentioned earlier, they cannot be allowed to stay here for more than six months at a stretch. However, those who set up joint ventures in India can be granted Business visa for upto ten years. Conference Visa They are granted to those foreign delegates who have to attend a conference in India which has been offered by an Indian government organization. But if they have to apply for a Business visa if they are attending a conference with a private organization in India. Journalist Visa Journalist visa is issued if one is a professional journalist or a professional photographer, and who intends to shoot a film or a documentary in India. The major advantage of getting a Journalist visa is that one gets the access to go to a YOJANA May 2015 41particular region or to meet a person. It is usually granted for a period of thre e months. But Indian government is quite sensitive about granting this visa to foreign nationals as to how they may depict India in their work. So if one mentions his or her occupation as a journalist or a photographer on his visa application , then he will have to obtain a journalist Visa irrespective of what exactly he or she wants to do in India. Research Visa Research visas are usually granted to professors or the scholars who come to visit India for some research or study related purposes. Getting a Research visa is a long process as it has many restrictions and conditional requirements. First the applications are sent to the Department of Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development for approval, that can take up to three months to be approved by the Ministry. For this reason people seek a Tourist visa instead, if their research is to conducted informally and they are not going to be in India for a period of more than six months. Medical Visa Medical visas are granted to those who have to undergo some medical treatment in India at recognized and specialized hospitals, and treatment centres. But their should be prominent in nature like organ transplant, neurosurgery, heart surgery, joint replacement, gene therapy and plastic surgery. Medical Attendant visas for up to two people can be issued for people accompanying the patient. Transit Visa Transit visa is required when the visitor has to stay in India for less than 72 hours. For more than that time , he will have to apply for a Tourist visa. A confirmed airline booking for tickets and related things for the onward journey have to be shown while applying for this visa. X (Entry) Visa For people who do not exactly fall into any of the these categories of visa applications such as volunteers etc. an x visa is issued. However, an x visa is only available to a foreigner of Indian origin, Spouse and children of a foreigner of Indian origin or Indian citizen, spouse and dependent children of a foreigner coming to India on any other long term visa, such as an Employment visa or Business visa. x visas are not subject to gap of two months. Therefore, people of Indian origin should apply for one of these visas while they come to India. It's not possible to work in India on an x visa. But , x visas can be extended in India, eliminating the need to leave every six months. The most important document required is the student admission/registration paper from the concerned institution. Student visas are issued for up to five years, subject to the duration of the course. However, they can also be extended in India.

The developing countries, often endowed with natural resources, are now experiencing a dramatic increase in the number of visitors. As mass tourism often ends up with destruction of natural resources, ecotourism can reduce the negativities associated with mass tourism and thus brilliantly help in conservation. On the other hand, it will also stimulate growth through its positive impact on employment opportunities, income generation and education of the host communitiesOURISM IS a n important driver of growth,which raises the national income of many countries. Nevertheless, the critics consider that tourism development is self-destructive and in the long run, it contributes to environmental destruction. Increasing numbers of tourists often threaten the quality of life and environment. Concomitant with the rapid development of the tourism industry, there are increasing environmental problems like rising greenhouse gas emissions, increasing noise, declining air quality, increasing water pollution and biodiversity loss, draining of wetlands, destruction of coral reefs, etc., leading to depletion of nature. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 1992 lists tourism as the second major threat to protected areas. Owing to the increasing negativities of tourism, several authors reiterated that tourism industry should grow carefully and in a sustainable manner. The Rio+20 Outcome Document \"The Future We Want\" highlights the role of sustainable tourism so as to come out of the adverse effects of tourism. The United Nations defines sustainable tourism as \"Tourism that takes full account of its current and future economic, social an d environmental impacts, addressing the needs of Bani Chatterjee is a Professor, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. Madhumita Das is Research Scholar, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur visitors, the industry, the environment and host co mmunities1\". The most important aspects of sustainable tourism are that it ensures long-term economic operations, provision of fairly distributed socio-economic benefits to all,through income-earning opportunities and social services to host communities. Thus, it serves a dual purpose of conservation of natural resources and poverty alleviation. Ecotourism originated as a type of sustainable tourism, and the first formal definition of Ecotourism is credited to Hector Ceballos-Lascur\u00e1in in the early 1980s. His definition asserts that as \"ecotourism is environmentally responsible travel and visitation to relatively undisturbed natural areas in order to enjoy and appreciate nature that promotes conservation, has low negative visitor impact, and provides for beneficially active socio-economic involvement of the local populations\" 2. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (Now World Conservation Union) has officially adopted this definition during its 1st World Conservation Congress held in Montreal in October 1996. Today, ecotourism is one of the fastest growing markets, considered as one of the world's biggest industries. Starmer-Smith's study (2004) stated that the numbe r of eco-tourists is growing three times faster than the YOJANA May 2015 43conventional tourists. Their study also forecasts that by 2024, ecotourism is expected to represent 5 per cent of the global holiday market. The growth of this niche market is because of changing consumer patterns. Tourists are becoming environmentally conscious and thus are becoming \"greener\" (Sharpley, 2006:8).For example, in a 2012 poll undertaken by Blue and Green Tomorrow, 47 per cent of respondents answered that they would consider the ethical or environmental footprint of their main holiday in 2013. In India, in Bhitarkanika National Park, the number of tourists increased from 37,080 to 46,917 from 2008-09 to 2012-13 (Information Brochure, Mangrove Forest Division (WL), Rajnagar, Kendrapara, Odisha). International tourism arrivals are expanding at 6.5 per cent annually and within this, ecotourism is growing at an annual rate of 5 per cent representing the fastest growing market (Das, 2011). For developing countries like India, Ecotourism serves as an ideal industry for fostering economic growth and conservation. The developing countries, often endowed with natural resources, are now experiencing a dramatic increase in the number of visitors. As mass tourism often ends up with destruction of natural resources, ecotourism can reduce the negativities associated with mass tourism and thus brilliantly help in conservation. On the other hand, it will also stimulate growth through its positive impact on employment opportunities, income generation and education of the host communities. Ecotourism in India India has been recognized as the land of natural beauty. Max Muller had once pointed out that\"If we were to look over the whole world to find out the country most richly endowed with all the wealth, power and beauty which nature can bestow- in some parts a veritable paradise on earth- I should point to India\" 3. Based on Ecotourism Policy and Guidelines developed by the Indian Ministry of T ourism in 1998, the Ministry of Environment and Forest in June 2011 called on State governments to frame ecotourism policies to facilitate tourism programmes in protected areas of the country. In addition, 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17) targets to increase the net benefit of tourism activities for the poor, emphasizing that the revenue generated from tourism operations should be utilized for protected area management. At present, India has 661 protected areas with 100 national parks, 514 wildlife sanctuaries, 43 conservation reserves and four community reserves in different geographic zones, extending to nearly five per cent of the geographical area of the country 4. The ecotourism policy in India has tried to bring an interlinkage between livelihood activities and conservation. It has been trying to provide an alternative to the exploitative use of natural resources to the local communities. Employm ent opportunities are created for them. They are involved as stakeholders. In the process, they take pride about their natural resources and extend their hands in conservation.The case of Periyar Tiger Reserve, Kerela can be stated as a bright example. With the introduction of ecotourism in the reserve, several eco-development committees are formed. Host communities are given viable and innovative livelihood alternatives through opportunities like rafting, trekking, horse riding, nature camp etc. The project has so far benefited about 40,000 people of 5,540 families. With the help of such alternative livelihood, the poachers and smugglers have been converted as genuine promoters of conservation of forests 5. Even in case of Sunderban Tiger Reserve, West Bengal, ecotourism has been able to provide decent earning to the participants. The study of Guha and Ghosh (2007) has claimed that tourism participants spend 19 per cent more on food and 38 per cent more on non-food items compared to other villagers. Such increased spending by the tourism participants stimulates different production systems and thus leads to relative prosperity of the area. Ecotourism, through increase in standard of living of the local residents, also empowers them socio-politically and fosters respect for different cultures and human rights. Indirect incentives like improved infrastructure, health facilities, awareness and education from tourism development develops a positive attitude towards conservation. In Sunderban Project, it has been noted that a part of the increased income from ecotourism is used to finance the education of their children. The great Himalayan National Park is another bright example of ecotourism project in India. The Protected Area management initiated eco-development committees not only for the conservation process, but also for poverty alleviation in support of conservation, women empowerment, developing outreach to the remote villages and linking livelihoods to conservation. The women of poor households, dependent on natural resources of the PA are encouraged to form Women Saving and Credit Groups. These groups are now doing business with their own savings through different income generating activities. The empowerment of the weakest section of the hill society through strong local level institutions and livelihood based approach has resulted in genuine participation in micro-planning and decision making and thus, reduction in their forest dependencies. This has resulted in successful biodiversity conservation through economic and social empowerment which is a prerequisite for ecological sustainability (Mishra, Badola and Bharadwaj, 2009).As mass tourism often ends up with destruction of natural resources, ecotourism can reduce the negativities associated with mass tourism and thus brilliantly help in conservation. On the other hand, it will also stimulate growth through its positive impact on employment opportunities, income generationand education of the host communities.44 YOJANA May 2015However, many ecotourism projects are strongly c riticized for not being able to adhere to the objectives laid down for a successful conservation policy. Often the environmental objective outweighs the other objectives by overlooking the strong linkage between livelihood of the host communities and conservation. Even in many cases, the gun and guard approach is used and locals are kept away from all information. This leads to conflict between protected areas and local people. For example, in case of Keoladeo National Park, Rajasthan, ecotourism is able to provide employment opportunities to the few Jatt males. Thus, the majority of the community does not support conservation. Compulsory eviction for the creation of national parks, lack of access to the protected areas, insecure land tenure, damage to crop and livestock by wild animals worsen the problem (Das & Chatterjee, 2015). In case of Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve, a world heritage site in Indian Himalayas, Maikhuri, Nautiyal, Rao, &Saxena(2001)estimated mean annual loss per household as Rs 1285, Rs 1195 and Rs 156 due to damage caused by wildlife to food crops, fruit trees and beehives respectively, Rs 1587 due to ban on collection of wild medicinal plants for marketing and Rs 7904 due to ban on tourism in the core zone. Although Reserve authority granted compensation of livestock killed by wildlife, this was hardly 5 per cent of the market value of killed livestock as assessed by the people. People did not appreciate the present benefits from the reserve management in the form of wages for carrying out of forestation work, partial compensation of livestock damage and avail ability of solar power devices, wool, and spinning devices. All such actions finally inculcate a harmful attitude in the minds of the locals towards conservation. Bhitarkanika wildlife Sanctuary Case Study Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary (BKWS), famous for endangered salt water Crocodile (Crocodile porosus), is located in the Kendrapara District of Odisha in Eastern India. The park is mentioned in the Guinness World Records in 2008 with a 23-foot saltwater crocodile listed as the largest in the world. The national park (Bhitarkanika National Park) was created in September 1998 from the core area of the Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary, which was created in 1975.The sanctuary is the second largest mangrove ecosystem in India. The park encompasses an area of 672 sq. km of the Bhitarkanika Mangroves, a mangrove swamp which lies in the river delta of Brahmani, Baitarani, and Dhamra rivers. From the information brochure of Mangrove Forest Division (WL), Rajnagar, Kendrapara, Odisha, it is found that recently, the park witnessed an increase in the flow of visitors for its rich scenic beauty. The number of annual tourist flow in the park along with the revenue collected from them is presented in Table-1 below. With the increase in the number of tourists, different work prospects are created for the locals. Efforts are also taken to create opportunities for the local people to motivate them to participate in ecotourism so that the dependency of the locals on the natural resources gets reduced and ecotourism positively contributes to conservation. With the impetus of the forest department, villagers have formed a number of Eco-development Committees (EDC). Bhitarkanika Ecotourism and Eco-development Society (BEES) has been formed recently with local people along with members of the forest department and few conservationists. The society gives training to the unskilled, so that they can be engaged in different work activities in ecotourism. The varieties of work opportunities inside and outside park are given in the Table-2: One of the most important developments after the introduction of ecotourism as perceived by the locals is the development of transportation and communication facilities. A pucca road has been constructed under Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana connecting Rajanagar to the National Park. With such improved infrastructure, there has been an increase in the number of visitors and this has led the locals to take more pride on their rich natural resources. Interactions with the tourists have also been helpful to the villagers in terms of their outlook and exposure. The females of the villages have been able to come out of the periphery of four walls. A numbers have been of Self Help Groups are created by them. Although at present, the groups are not very much efficient in running small or micro enterprises, but these groups have been able to strengthen group cohesion and bonding. In case of health and education also, there has been a slight improvement. The state run 108 ambulances can reach quickly to the needy for the improved transport facilities. The children of the villagers can go to schools even in the rainy season which was a major problem Table 1: Visitor Flow and Revenue Collected Year Number of Tourists Revenue Collected (INR) Indian Foreigner 2015 45due to poor kuccha road facilities. However, the condition needs to be improved in th e villages that are far away from the National Park. With the socio-economic and cultural benefits, BKWS witnesses a reduction in the collection of fuelwood, mangrove leaves, honey etc. There has been also an increase in the number of wild animals. The number of endangered Crocodile Porosus has increased from 1308 in 2002-03 to 1610 in 2009-10 as per wildlife census. As per the views of the locals, they can now see cheetals, wild bear etc. regularly which were not there 10 years ago. They also perceive that there has been an increase in the forest covers due to ban on collection of fuelwood. Majority of the locals have gradually developed a positive attitude towards ecotourism. However, although ecotourism has undoubtedly contributed positively to the income earnings of the locals, a detailed discussion with the participants has revealed that the majority of the participants of ecotourism in BKWS are the wage labourers. While boat business comes in the second category, third is the restaurant and tiffin business. There are a few hotels inside the sanctuary, but the owners are not the residents of BKWS. A handful of eco-guides are at present, engaged in the peak tourist season. The reason for a high presence of wage labourers in ecotourism is due to book education or no education of the villagers. Women participants are even lower in ecotourism related jobs compared to male participants due to th e nature of the work available and lack of education. Mostly, the females work as contractual wage labourers in the park. There is also a wide s cale difference in the income among ecotourism participants. The tour operators enjoy the maximum profit followed by hotel owners, restaurant owners and boat men. The wage labourers in the park are mostly the contractual workers getting wages below the market wage rate. Many of them agree that their life standard has not improved significantly because of less wage rates. This is the reason for the dependency of the locals on natural resources like extraction of fuel wood, honey, fodder from forests, fishing from the rivers, and prawn culture at the river bank by taking river water. However, participation in ecotourism is preferred because of its relative stability of earning and opportunity to stay with family members.The worst sufferers are the eco-guides for the faulty management practice, and in some cases monopoly of the boat owners. In few cases, conversation with the tourists also revealed that mostly eco-guides are not very much efficient and thus, it makes no sense for them to bear the additional cost of guides. The most important problem is that as tourism is concentrated for four months mainly from October to February, locals fail to earn substantially and consistently from ecotourism. Indirect effect of ecotourism in BKWS is also less for mostly two reasons: (1) unavailability of local enterprises, (2) import of goods and services. Destruction of life, livestock, and crops by w ild animals, lack o f fuel depot etc. are some of the major problems that the locals face due to ecotourism. In man y cases, compensation is also not provided for the complexities of the process. As per the statement of the villagers, \"wild animals are more precious to the government than human lives\". There exists a structural limit to community participation because of lack of qualified human resources and bureaucratic nature of the forest department. Thus, a proper management of the three major stakeholders: (a) resources, (b) community, and (c) tourists, is highly required for the success of ecotourism in BKWS. More awareness campaigns for the locals as well as the tourists will help in conservation. Involvement of the local people through their awareness will develop their interest in such policies and they will consider themselves as stakeholders.Educating tourists about conservation will also help such conservation policies.Once the locals realize the worth of their natural resources, they will fully co-operate in the conservation . Instead of Gun and Guard approach, steps should be taken to inculcate a positive attitude in the minds of the locals about conservation.Government should take steps to come out of the institutional failure and corruptive practices. It should also take positive steps through proper monitoring, evaluation and management of the site at economic, social, and environment level, which is required for reinforcing conservation. Thus, one hopes to look for an ecotourism project that takes into care, the wholesome development of the locals in Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuar y.

Once there is a strong integration of conservation of natural resources and improvement in human well-being,ecotourism will undoubtedly be a successful policy. The policy drawbacks are thus to be addressed adequately by effective involvement of the local people, inculcating awareness about conservation, educating locals as well as tourists etc. to create a win-win scenario for both the local communities and natural resources.

These factors are present here in India too which gives a ray of hope for flourishing edu-tourism here. Even the annual report 2015 of Ministry of Tourism also says, \"India's contact with other civilisations is reflected in the rich cultural diversity of its people through its languages, cuisines, traditions, art and craftNDIA HAS remained an important centre of education for most of the South-Asian countries since the ancient period. Taxila University, Nalanda University and Vikramshila University were epitome of knowledge and most preferred destinations for not only domestic scholars, but also foreign travellers for knowledge sharing and learning purposes. In spite of inhering such glorious past of being a prominent centre of educational tourism, today India is struggling to project itself as an important educational destination. However, with tremendous growth of both tourism and education sector in India, it has a strong potential to become an admired educational destination for the world in general and for the neighbouring countries in particular. Before dwelling upon the issue further, first we must understand what education tourism is. The term education tourism or edu-tourism refers to any \"program in which participants travel to a location as a group with the primary purpose of engaging in a learning experience directly related to the location\" (Bodger, 1998, p.28). This notion of travelling for educational purposes is not new and according to some great thinkers, its popularity in the tourism Ms Archana Kumari, is Assistant Professor, Central University of Jammu. Divyanshu Kumar is Assistant Professor, IIMC.market is only e xpected to increase (Gibson, 1998; Holdnak & Holland, 1996). India too has acknowledged its prominent share in education sector both domestically and globally and is exploring opportunities to present itself as an attractive destination for students all over world. The favourable factors for India are - l India is one of the fastest growing economy of the world. l It is emerging as a major tourist destination . l Staying here is cheaper than many developed countries of the world. l There are many good academic institutions in India with all kinds of resources and facilities. l It is one of the major suppliers of skilled manpower to the developed nations. Before discussing further all the favourable factors for educational tourism in India, let us see which factors made India the most favourable educational destination in ancient times. Glorious Past Along with Taxila University and Nalanda University in ancient India, there were some other Universities too that existed. Some of them were - Odantapuri in Bihar (circa 550 - 1040) Somapura in Bangladesh (from the Gupta period to the Muslim YOJANA May 2015 49conquest), Jagaddala in Bengal (from the Pala period to the Kashmir, Valabhi in Gujarat (from the Maitrak period to the Arab raids), Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh (8th century to in Orissa, Sunethradevi Pirivenaa centre of Buddhist learning in Sri Lanka, founded in circa 1415 AD. [1] However the most popular and prestigious among all these universities were Taxila University (5 th century BC to 5th century AD) and Nalanda University (from 427 to 1197). Taxila University is well known for three great personalities of India, Chanakya, Chandragupta and Charak. The famous ancient book on economics and polity 'Arthashastra' is believed to be written here by Chanakya. The great emperor of India, Chandragupta Maurya also studied here and the Ayurvedic healer Charaka who wrote the famous 'Charak Samhita' studied at Taxila. Generally, a student entered Taxila at the age of sixteen. The Vedas and the Eighteen Arts, which included skills such as archery, hunting, and elephant lore, were taught, in addition to its law school, medical school, and school of military science. Taxila was not only the seat of Vedic learning, but also was very significant in Buddhist tradition since it is believed that the Mahyna sect of Buddhism took shape there. [2] This unique characteristic of this university to accommodate and impart multiple discourses under one roof seemed to be the most attractive feature which tempted knowledge seekers from the various parts of the world. In that period, India was a must visit country for people of neighbouring Buddhist countries both for pilgrimage and Buddhist studies. Apart from such religious studies, popular skills were also taught in this university, which further added educational value to the institution.In similar circumstances, Nalanda University also flourished. Magadh was prosper ous and intellectual empire which also believed in patronising centre of intellectualism. This university again endorsed both Buddhist and non- Buddhist learnings in its entirety, which provided breeding ground for holistic knowledge. According to historical sources, it was a residential university with over 2,000 teachers and 10,000 students. [3] The knowledge imparting system of this university and the profound knowledge of its teachers attracted students from China, Korea, Japan, Tibet, Mongolia, Turkey, Sri Lanka and some other countries of South East Asia. These scholars described about the ambience, way of teaching, unique architecture and unique lifestyle inside the university. Especially Chinese scholar xuan Zang wrote detail account about the university.[4] Analysing the above mentioned facts about the world famous universities situated in India, which attracted a good number of educational tourists and that too in an era when commutation and communication both were difficult, following important points of attraction emerge: l India being a multi-religious and multi-cultural society, had always been an attractive centre for religious and cultural studies. l Apart from religious and cultural studies, outsiders were also interested in learning indigenous skills.l The ability and knowledge possessed by profound teachers in these universities was one of the key elements for attracting scholars from various parts of the country and abroad. l Not only studies, but ambience, unique teaching-learning system, co-existence with nature also attracted both domestic as well as global educational tourists. l Since these universities existed over a long period of time under different rulers of India, its fame and expertise increased manifold. Opaque Present Tourism in India has emerged as a huge industry. According to the annual report of the Ministry of Tourism in India, its contribution to GDP of the country is 6.88 per cent in the year 2012-2013 while its contribution in the employment of the country is 12.36 per cent in 2012-2013. [5] The GDP of the tourism sector has expanded 229 per cent between 1990 and 2011 and the sector is predicted to grow at an average annual rate of 7.7 per cent in this decade. [6] In a 2011 forecast, the World Travel and Tourism Council predicted the annual growth to be 8.8 per cent between 2011 and 2021. [7] This gave India the fifth rank among countries with the fastest growing tourism industry. However, the question remains, what is the position of educational tourism in this fastest growing tourism sector in India! Before dwelling upon this question, let us ponder upon some of the facts which came into light with the report of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Education at a glance, 2014: l Students from Asia represent 53 per cent of foreign students enrolled worldwide. The largest numbers of foreign students from this continent are from China, India and Korea. l Europe is the top destination for students at the tertiary level of education enrolled outside their country of origin, hosting 48 per India is one of the fastest growing economy of the world. l It is emerging as a major tourist destination. l Staying here is cheaper than many developed countries of the world. l There are many good academic institutions in India with all kinds of resources and facilities. l It is one of the major suppliers of skilled manpower to the developed nations.50 YOJANA May 2015cent of these students, followed by North America, which hosts 21 per cent of all international students, and Asia with 18 per cent. l Over the past three decades, the number of students enrolled outside their country of citizenship has risen dramatically, from 0.8 million worldwide in 1975 to 4.5 million in 2012, a more than five fold increase. From the above mentioned facts, it is clear that Asia as a region and India as a country is an origin for edu-tourism rather than a destination. Analysing the reasons for Europe being the top destination for students, it was found - \"This remarkable expansion stems from an interest in promoting academic, cultural, social and political ties among countries, particularly as the European Union was taking shape, to a substantial increase in global access to tertiary education, and to reduced transportation costs. The internationalisation of labour markets for highly skilled people has also given students an incentive to gain international experience as part of their higher education.\" [8] There is one more observation regarding global student mobility: \"It follows inter- and intra-regional migration patterns to a great extent. The growth in the internationalisation of tertiary enrolment in OECD countries, as well as the high proportion of intra-regional student mobility shows the growing importance of regional mobility over global mobility\". Student flows in European countries and in Eastern Asia and Oceania tend to reflect the evolution of geopolitical areas, such as closer ties between Asia-Pacific countries and further co-operation among European countries beyond the European Union (UNESCO, 2009). The second-largest proportion of international students comes from India (5.8 per cent). Some 45 per cent of Indian students abroad are enrolled in the United States, 17 per cent are in the United Kingdom, 6 per cent in Canada and 5 per cent are in Australia. [9] Analysing the above mentioned facts about present scenario of edu-tourism in the world, in general and in India, in particular, following points have emerged: l In the present edu-tourism scenario, 5.8 per cent Indians go abroad for education rather than staying in their own country thus hampering domestic tourism. l Regional mobility among students is more preferred than global mobility. l Promoting academic, cultural, social and political ties among countries and lessening transportation cost as well as easier visa policies are most supporting factors for increasing edu-tourism in a country. This presents an opaque picture of out-bou nd edu-tourism in India; however domestic edu-tourism is very much in practice in India. According to the annual report 2015 of Ministry of Tourism, the number of domestic tourist visits during the year 2013 was 1145 million (approx.) showing a growth of 9.59 per cent over 2012. People of rural areas and small cities send their children to big cities for better educational facilities. That too depends upon the economic capabilities of people. However, when we talk about edu-tourism in India, we referred to developing India as a major tourist destination for educational purposes. This sector of tourism has not been given even the st atus of one of the niche areas of tourism by the Ministry of Tourism in India in its annual report of 2015, wh ich shows that Indian government has not evaluated the potential of growth in this particular area of Tourism. Promising Future Though the present scenario of educational tourism in India seems to be blurred, it has the potential to shine. There are many factors which have been highlighted by global reports for favouring educational tourism. These factors are present here in India too which gives a ray of hope for flourishing edu-tourism here. Even the annual report 2015 of Ministry of Tourism also says, \"India's contact with other civilisations is reflected in the rich cultural diversity of its people through its languages, cuisines, traditions, art and craft. Despite an impressive growth in foreign tourist arrivals (FTAs) witnessed in the recent years, it is felt that India still has a vast untapped potential in tourism.\" Resource base for Educational Tourism India has abundant tourism resources which can be used as a support for educational tourism here. Some of these are - Cultural or historical tourism, ecotourism or nature based tourism, rural tourism, medical tourism etc. With it there are many students' exchange as well as faculty exchange programmes in the universities which facilitate the foreign students and faculty to spend some time in India. Some of the examples of themes that may be used for education tourism are - Cultural and historical themes like: arts and crafts, architecture, language, archaeological sites, music, dance etc. Ecotourism like: studying 65,000 species of fauna including 350 of mammals, 408 of reptiles, 197 of amphibians, 1244 of birds, 2546 of fishes as well as 15000 species of flora. [10] There are 80 national parks and 441 sanctuaries in India, some of which are largest wildlife sanctuaries in Asia. There can be religious themes as well which would include studying the \"India's contact with other civilisations is reflected in the rich cultural diversity of its people through its languages, cuisines, traditions, art and craft. Despite an impressive growth in foreign tourist arrivals (FTAs) witnessed in the recent years, it is felt that India still has a vast untapped potential in tourism.\"YOJANA May 2015 51force. As a result, immigration considerations as well as tuition fees may also affect some students' decisions on where to study abroad (OECD, 2011). l Students also make decisions on where to study based on other factors such as: the academic reputation of particular institutions or programmes; the flexibility of programmes in counting time spent abroad towards degree requirements; recognition of foreign degrees; the limitations of tertiary education in the home country; restrictive university admission policies at home; geographical, trade or historical links between countries; future job opportunities; cultural aspirations; and government policies to facilitate the transfer of credits between home and host institutions. l On analysing minutely all the above mentioned factors, we find that in India, English is medium of instruction and it is widely read and spoken among people in all big cities. There is no dearth of quality education in India and that too on lower tuition fee which is evident from the number of India educated doctors and engineers who are serving abroad. Also, India does not have a very strict immigration policy which would deter the prospective international students from coming to India. But the degree provided here is not consid ered of international There is no dearth of quality education in India and that too on lower tuition fee which is evident from the number of India educated doctors and engineers who are serving abroad.

Market for Edu-Tourism in India Thought at present, there is not a big market for edu-tourism in India, but some of the factors indicate that a market is in the process of evolving. Let us pay heed to following factors mentioned in the annual report 2015 of Ministry of Tourism and OECD Education at a glance, 2015: l The year 2014 witnessed a growth of 10.6 per cent in FTAs in India, which is higher than the medium growth rate of 4.7 per cent witnessed in International Tourist Arrivals, globally. l The language spoken and used in instruction sometimes determines the country in which a student chooses to study. Countries whose language of instruction is widely spoken and read, such as English, are therefore leading destinations for foreign students, both in absolute and relative terms. l International students increasingly select their study destination based on the quality of education offered, as perceived from a wide array of information on and rankings of, higher education programmes now available, both in print and on line. l Tuition cost also plays an important role in selection of an educational destination. It however tuition costs do not necessarily discourage prospective international students, as long as the quality of education provided is high and its potential returns make the investment worthwhile. l In recent years, several OECD countries have eased their immigration policies to encourage the temporary or permanent immigration of international students (OECD, 2008). This makes these countrie s more attractive to students and strengthens their labour standards; neith er is there a proper uniform mechanism for transfer of credits between home and host institutions. If we can amend these shortcomings in our education system and provide all facilities to attract foreign students, it is certain that India would emerge as most favoured destination for both in- bound and out-bound educational tourism.

Tourism in India should be developed in such a way that it accommodates and entertains visitors in a way that is minimally intrusive or destructive to the environment The author is Assistant Professor, Department of Economics, Thiruvalluvar University, Serkkadu, Vellore,Tamil Nadu. and habitat. Revenue from park- entrance fees and similar sources can be allocated specifically to pay for the protection and management of environmentally sensitive areas. Special fees for park operations or conservation activities can be collected from tourists or tour operators. l The Indian government through the tourism department also collects money in more far-reaching and indirect ways that are not linked to specific parks or conservation areas. User fees, income taxes, taxes on sales or rental of recreation equipment, and license fees for activities such as rafting and fishing can provide governments with funds needed to manage natural resources. Such funds can be used for overall conservation programs and activities, such as park ranger salaries and park maintenance. Improvement of Environmental Management Sound environmental management of tourism facilities and especially hotels can increase the benefits to natural environment. By planning early for tourism development, damaging and expensive mistakes can be prevented, avoiding gradual deterioration of environmental assets significant to tourism. The development of tourism has moved the Indian government to wards this direction leading to improved environmental management.HE QUALITY of the environment, both natural and man-made, is essential to tourism. However, tourism's relationship with the environment is complex. It involves many activities that can have adverse environmental effects. The negative impact of tourism development can gradually destroy the environmental resources on which it depends. On the other hand, tourism has the potential to create beneficial effects on the environment by contributing to environmental protection and conservation. It is a way to raise awareness of environmental values and it can serve as a tool to finance protection of natural areas and increase their economic importance. Impact of Tourism Negative impact tourism occur when the level of visitor use is greater than the environment's ability to cope with this use within the acceptable limits of change. Uncontrolled conventional tourism poses potential threats to many natural areas around the world. It can put enormous pressure on an area and lead to impacts such as soil erosion, increased pollution, discharges into the sea, natural habitat loss, and increased pressure on endangered species. Positive Impact Direct Revenue to the Government l Tourism can contribute directly to the conservation of sensitive areas 54 YOJANA May 2015Environmental Awarenes s Tourism has the potential to increase public appreciation of the environment and to spread awareness of environmental problems when it brings people into closer contact with nature and the environment. This confrontation heightens awareness about the value of nature among the community and lead to environmentally conscious behavior and activities. Protection and Preservation of Environment l To u r i s m c a n s i g n i f i c a n t l y contribute to environmental protection, conservation and restoration of biological diversity and sustainable use of natural resources. Because of their attractiveness, pristine sites and natural areas are identified as valuable and the need to keep the attraction alive can lead to creation of national parks and wildlife parks. l In India, new laws and regulations have been enacted to preserve forest cover and to protect native species. The coral reefs around the coastal areas and the marine life that depend on them are also protected. Negative Impacts Depletion of Natural Resources Tourism development can put pressure on natural resources when it increases consumption in areas where resources are already scarce. water Resources Water, especially fresh water, is one of the most critical natural resources. The tourism industry generally overuses water resources for hotels, swimming pools, golf courses and personal use of water by tourists. This can result in water shortages and degradation of water supplies, as well as generating a greater volume of waste water. Local Resources Tourism can create great pressure on local resources like energy, food, and other raw materials that may already be in short supply. Greater extraction and transport of these resources exacerbates the physical impacts associated with their exploitation. Because of the seasonal character of the industry, many destinations have ten times more inhabitants in the high season. High demand is placed upon these resources to meet the high expectations tourists often have. Land degradation Important land resources include minerals, fossil fuels, fertile soil, forests, wetlands and wildlife. Increased construction of tourism and recreational facilities has increased the pressure on these resources and on scenic landsc apes. Forests often suffer negative impacts of tourism in the form of deforestation caused by fuel wood collection and land clearing e.g. trekking in the Himalayan region, Sikkim and Assam. Pollution Tourism can cause the same forms of pollution as any other industry: air emissions, noise, solid waste and littering, releases of sewage, oil and chemicals, even architectural and visual pollution. Air and Noise Pollution l Transport by air, road, and rail is continuously increasing in response to the rising number of tourist activities in India. Transport emissions and em issions from energy production and use are linked to acid rain, global warming and photochemical pollution. Air pollution from tourist transportation has impacts on the global level, especially from carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions related to transportation energy use and it can lead to severe local air pollution. l Noise pollution from airplanes, cars, and buses, as well as recreational vehicles is an ever-growing problem of modern life. In addition to causing annoyance, stress and even hearing loss for humans, it causes distress to wildlife, especially in sensitive areas. Solid waste and Littering l In areas with high concentrations of tourist activities and appealing natural attractions, waste disposal is a serious problem and improper disposal can be a major despoiler of the natural environment - rivers, scenic areas, and roadsides. l In mountain areas of the Himalayas and Darjeeling, trekking tourists generate a great deal of waste. Tourists on expedition leave behind their garbage, oxygen cylinders and even camping equipment. Such practices degrade the environment particularly in remote areas because they have few garbage collection or disposal facilities. Sewage Construction of hotels, recreation and other facilities often lead to i n c r e a s e d s e w a g e p o l l u t i o n . Wastewater has polluted seas and lakes surrounding tourist attractions, damaging the flora and fauna. Sewage runoff causes serious damage to coral reefs because it stimulates the growth of algae, which cover the filter-feeding corals, hindering their ability to survive. Changes in salinity and siltation can have wide-ranging impacts on coastal environments. The sewage pollution can threaten the health of humans and animals. Examples of such pollution can be seen in the coastal states of Goa, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu etc.Tourism has the potential to increase public appreciation of the environment and to spread awareness of environmental problems when it brings people into closer contact with nature and the environment. This confrontation heightens awareness of the value of nature among the community and lead to environmentally conscious behavior and activities to preserve the environment.YOJANA May 2015 55Destruction and Alteration of Ecosystem An ecosystem is a geographic area including all the living organisms, their physical surroundings and the natural cycles that sustain them. Attractive landscape sites, such as sandy beaches in Goa, Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu; lakes, riversides, and mountain tops and slopes, are often transitional zones, characterized by species-rich ecosystems. The threats to and pressures on these ecosystems are often severe because such places are very attractive to both tourists and developers. Examples may be cited from Kurusadai Island near Rameswaram. Aesthetic Pollution l Often tourism fails to integrate its structures with the natural features and indigenous architectural beauty of the destination. Large, dominating resorts of disparate design can look out of place in any natural environment and may clash with the indigenous structural design. l Lack of land-use planning and building regulations in many destinations has facilitated sprawling developments along coastlines, valleys and scenic routes. The sprawl includes tourism facilities themselves and supporting infrastructure such as roads, employee housing, parking, service areas and waste disposal. Physical Impacts l Attractive landscape sites, such as sandy beaches, lakes, riversides, and mountain tops and slopes, are often transitional zones, characterized by species-rich ecosystems. Typical physical impacts include the degradation of such ecosystems. l In industrial countries, mass tourism and recreation are now fast overtaking the extractive industries as the largest threat to mountain communities and environments. l Physical impacts are caused not only by tourism-related land clearing and construction, but by continuing tourist activities and long-term changes in local economies and ecologies. l Trampling Tourists using the same trail over and over again trample the vegetation and soil, eventually causing damage that can lead to loss of biodiversity and other impacts. Such damage can be even more extensive when visitors frequently stray off established trails. l Alteration of ecosystems by tourist activities: Habitat can be degraded by tourism leisure activities. For example, wildlife viewing can bring about stress to animals and alter their natural behavior when tourists come too close. In some cases, as in Kenya, it has led to animals becoming so disturbed that at times they neglect their young or fail to mate. The Effects of Loss of Biodiversity l It threatens our food supplies, opportunities for recreation and tourism and sources of wood, medicines and energy. l It interferes with essential ecological functions such as species balance, soil formation, and greenhouse gas absorption. l It reduces the productivity of ecosystems, thereby shrinking nature's basket of goods and services, from which we constantly draw.l It destabilizes ecosystems and weakens their ability to deal with natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and hurricanes, and with human-caused stresses, such as pollution and climate change. Depletion of Ozone Layer l The ozone layer, which is situated in the upper atmosphere at an altitude of 12-50 kilometers, protects life on earth by absorbing the harmful wavelengths of the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which in high doses is dangerous to humans and animals. For instance, one of the reasons scientists have put forward for the global decrease of amphibian populations is increased exposure to UV radiation. l Refrigerators, air conditioners and propellants in aerosol spray cans, amongst others, contain ODSs and are widely used in the hotel and tourism industry. Emissions from jet aircraft are also a significant source of ODSs. According to Tourism Concern, scientists predict that by 2015 half of the annual destruction of the ozone layer will be caused by air travel. Climate Change Tourism not only contributes to climate change, but is affected by it as well. Climate change is likely to increase the severity and frequency of storms and severe weather events, which can have disastrous effects on tourism in the affected regions. Some of the other impacts that the world risks as a result of global warming are drought, diseases and heat waves. Conclusion Tourism industry in India is growing and it has vast potential for generating employment and earning large amount of foreign exchange besides giving a fillip to the country's overall economic and social development. Eco-tourism needs to be promoted so that tourism in India helps in preserving and sustaining the diversity of the India's natural and cultural environments. Tourism in India should be developed in such a way that it accommodates and entertains visitors in a way that is minimally intrusive Trampling impacts on vegetation Trampling impacts on soil Breakage and bruising of stems Loss of organic matter Reduced plant vigor Reduction in soil macro porosity Reduced regeneration Decrease in air and water permeability Loss of ground cover Increase in run off Change in species composition Accelerated erosion Source: University of Idaho56 YOJANA May 2015or destructive to the environment.

According to the findings of the reports, the incremental human resource requirement across these 24 sectors is nearly 109.73* million whereby the top 10 sectors account for about 80 percent of requirements. The reports were commissioned by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and authored by consulting firm KPMG. The objective of these skill gap reports was to understand the sectorial and geographical spread of skill requirements that exist. The figures have been estimated on the basis of extensive stakeholder engagement including small, medium and large enterprises in every sector as well as Sector Skill Councils (SSCs), training providers in the skills space and academia. The skill gap studies provide a granular data on the skill gaps for two time periods- 2013-17 and 2017-22.

Various Camp Secretariats have already been held in Manipur, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram. According to this concept, during each given fortnight, at least eight Union Ministers from New Delhi will be visiting northeast which means that one Minister each will be available in each of the eight States every 15 days. It will not only help them to make an assessment of the development works related to their Ministries, but also allow them to gain first-hand inputs from the local communities from the region. q The Government of Manipur will set up a Comprehensive Power Loom Development Project under the North East Region Textile Promotion Scheme (NERTPS) of the Government of India to cater to the needs of weavers/entrepreneurs of Manipur to generate employment opportunities. All possible technical assistance to the 41 identified weavers/entrepreneurs, on a continuous basis, would be provided by the Centre for sustained development of the sector.For this purpose, land of 45 acres near the Trade & Permanent Exhibition Centre at Lamboikhongnangkhong has been identified by the State Government for setting up the project. q The Ministry of Textiles has given the approval for the implementation of the Phase-II of Manipur Sericulture Project under the North East Region Textile Promotion Scheme (NERTPS) for the Mulberry Sericulture development programmes starting from 2014-'15 to 2016-'17 with a total cost of Rs. 149.76 crores, out of which, Rs. 126.60 crores will be given by the Ministry. The project is expected to yield 638 MT of mulberry raw silk worth Rs. 159.38 crores during the project period. The project will facilitate production of 203 MT of mulberry raw silk per year with a value of Rs.50.62 crores at current prices. So far, the Department of Sericulture, Govt. of Manipur has brushed 11.69 lakh mulberry dfls (disease free layings) in the project area and has produced 615.45 MT of cocoons with a cocoon productivity of 52 kg/ 100 dfls with the existing acreage available, with around 2500 farmers. q The foundation stone for an Apparel & Garment Making Centre at Pasighat, Arunachal Pradesh was laid recently. The Centre is being set up as part of a landmark initiative announced by the Honourable Prime Minister in Nagaland, on 1st December, 2014. The Prime Minister had announced that an Apparel and Garment Making Centre shall be constructed in all North Eastern states. each of which would be expected to generate direct employment for 1,200 people. Each state would have one centre with three units, each having 100 machines. For local entrepreneurs with requisite background, required facilities to start a unit would be provided in 'plug and play' mode. Once such entrepreneurs get established, they can set up their own units, allowing the facility to be provided to new entrepreneurs. The initiative comes under the North East Region Textile Promotion Scheme (NERTPS) of the Ministry of Textiles. NERTPS is an umbrella scheme for the development of various segments of textiles, i.e. silk, handlooms, handicrafts and apparels & garments. The scheme has a total outlay of Rs. 1038.10 crore in the 12th Five Year Plan. q J&K WINDOW FIRST THERMAL POwER PROJECT IN JAMMu & KASHMIR The power-starved state of Jammu and Kashmir has decided to get into an agreement with the country's largest power producer National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) for construction of 660 MW coal-based super critical thermal power project. This thermal power project would be the first of its kind in the state and will be a joint venture between the Jammu and Kashmir State Power Development Corporation and the NTPC, with a capacity of 660 MW. Presently, the state faces severe power shortage during the winters as the discharge of the rivers is less. Hence, there was a great need for a coal-based thermal power station to cater to the base load requirement with sufficient reliability. The project was earlier planned to be set up in Kathua but now, the project shall be located at the pithead in Odisha. Jammu and Kashmir has already been allocated a coal mine at Kudnali Laburi in Odisha. The coal block has been allocated jointly to the JKSPDC and the NTPC with a reserve of 130 and 266 million tonnes, respectively. The project is expected to be completed in the coming eight years. q58 YOJANA May 2015Under Anoop Kumar Singh Under the Guidance of G. S. MAINS, G. S.

These cultural forms are necessary for identity of the society, for developing thought process in different segments of the society and for development of internal communication and understanding in the society. There is a direct relationship in between society's heritage, culture and traditional forms with tourism The author is Astt. Professor at SOTHSM, IGNOU, New Delhi. He has fourteen years of teaching experience at Post Graduate level. He has two titles and thirteen published research papers/articles to his credit. He is Managing Editor at Global Journal of Enterprise Information System (GJEIS). His areas of interest are Heritage Tourism Management, Sustainable Tourism Development, Integrated Planning and Tourism Impacts. belongings are going to be modified in the form of a \"product\" so that it can be showcased to the tourist. This modification is done by Travel Agents, Tour Operators, Guides, Escorts, Interpreters, Hoteliers, NGOs, Government, Private Agencies etc. Role of society is very important in travel and tourism industry as society will act as \"Host\" and tourist will act as \"Guest\" and in India guest is God \"Atithi devobhava \". So study of Guest- Host relationship is a very important aspect of tourism. Tourist motivation, perceptions and attitudes of the host (society) are important factors in determining and resolving conflicts between hosts and guest, authority and locals and land use planners and environmentalists. For any kind of tourism development, society's approval and sanction is required for determining tourist vacation practices and styles. There are certain dos and don'ts related to locality and tourist as guest should follow social norms. Different types of tourism give rise to different forms of interaction between guest and host. It's the responsibility of society as a host to provide all infrastructure and services needed by tourist. At the time o f interaction, diverse situations may arise in guest-host INCE TIME immemor i a l t h r e e f a c t o r s , h a v e charact erized travel and tourism phenomena, t h a t i s C u r i o s i t y, Anticipation and Graffiti (Hudman and Hawkins, 1989). Curiosity always led people to explore new geographical areas (environment), seek new places, discover the unknown and enjoy new experiences. Anticipation, always forced people to think of what one may \"find, see, able to do etc.\" through movement to new places. These factors increased the desire to travel and made travel most enjoyable. Through graffiti, universal desire of telling history of one's journey is fulfilled. In modern tourism, it has been converted into \"souvenirs\" and related business. Society and Tourism According to MacCannell(1992). \"Tourism is not just an aggregate of merely commercial activities; it is also an ideological framing of history, nature and tradition; a framing that has the power to reshape culture and nature to its own needs\". The related debate highlighted importance of society because whatever history, heritage, culture and tradition is going to be showcased to the tourist in the form of tourism products, ownership of the same lies with society. Society's 60 YOJANA May 2015relationship. F rom the host point of view, it may be \"Welcome with smile or be cool/aloof or extort money/ cheat or be very friendly\" ( Tourism Developme nt: Products, Operations and Case Studies, TS-2, IGNOU material). In fact, all these situations depend on nature of tourism, duration of interaction, impacts, type of development and profile of host and guest. Social distance, toleration level, educational level and mindset of host are also very important factors. With interaction and passage of time, host's attitude will be developed and governed by direct personal experience, image and perception of guest. These could be in relation to economic benefits and social and cultural exchange. 1) Economic and Socio-Cultural Aspects:- i) Integration of tourism with local economy is necessary for getting benefits. ii) Economic disparities, recession, inflation, political and diplomatic relation affects guest and host relations. iii) Movement of labour force towards Tourism may affect other economic activities like agriculture, fishing, poultry, food processing business etc. iv) Guest-host relationship will not be good if intellectual differences continue between native population and the visitor. v) Tourism sometimes creates rift between guest-host, when more mass produced goods affect the livelihood of traditional artisanship. vi) Cultural changes are observed at destinations where tourists are large in number. The impact of cultural changes in the guest- host relationship will impact as: i) Consumerism ii)Tourist mindset towards local norms. iii) The intensity and mindset of local youth to earn easy money. iv) The toleration level of local people to insensitive tourist behavior. v) The role of social network (like Facebook, Whats- App Twitter, You- Tube), mail, media and guide books. vi) Extent of penetration of tourist to local society. Tourism is a mixed blessing when it creates jobs and increases income with addition of physical and social burden. Healthy guest-host relationship can be maintained if destination uses forms of tourism to control the number of tourist visiting. As per Smith, there are 7 categories of tourist (Smith, 1978) visiting a destination with varied, local relationship like: i) Explorer Tourist :- Visit new places, in search of new experiences, involve with local people and accept local norms fully. ii) Elite Tourist: - Visit exotic places, tour is well managed and adopts local norms and culture fully. iii) Off Beat Tourist:- Desire to get away from crowds, uncommon but seen and adapts local norms and culture well. iv) Unusual Tourist:-Have special objective like adventure, danger, isolation. Visit is occasional and little adaptation of local norms and culture. v) Incipient Mass Tourist: -Move in small groups, tour is organized and use share services. They seek western amenities and not much interested in interaction with locals. vi) Mass Tourist:-Continuous flow of large number of tourist. Tour is well managed and organized. Generally on package tour. Expect western amenities and local interaction is not much. vii) Charter Tourist:-They are on pleasure trip and demand western amenities. Tour is package tour, well planned and managed. Least interaction with local society.The guest- host relationship is a very complex and sensitive area and needs to be researched at tourism planning stage as mindset and related expectations of guest and host varies. (TS-02), iGNOU). The host (local people) expects income, employment, regional development, consumer goods, social interaction, respect and dignity etc. from the guest (tourist). They are ready to showcase their culture and heritage but privacy must be respected. Guest (tourist) are stranger and from other geographical area. They are expecting consumable resources and infrastructure, local transport, safety, security, cultural interaction and value for money from the society (host). Every society has specific mindset and cultural forms. These cultural forms are necessary for identity of the society, for developing thought process in different segments of the society and for development of internal communication and understanding in the society. There is a direct relationship in between society's heritage, culture and traditional forms with tourism which can be understood by Fig.-1. \"A tradition is long-established custom or belief which is followed by past and present generations. As a part of heritage, it will also be passed on from one generation to another generation. The resultant of amalgamation is the society's resources to be converted into tourism product by travel and tourism industry. The society's resources can be categorized as:- i) Socio-Cultural Resources :- House-hold belongings, lifestyle, costumes, way of behaving, Museums, Historical and Epic Sites, etc. ii) Living Area and its Architectural Resources : Havelies, Forts, Palaces, old living cities etc. iii) Religious Practices at: Temples, Samadhi, Mosque, Tom bs, Dargah, 2015 61Ponds, Gram devata, Kuldevata etc. iv) E c o n o m i c a l A c t i v i t i e s : Agricultural attractions, Farms, Fishing, Water Reservoirs, Windmills, Potters, Wood Carvers, Glass makers, Brassware, Bangles, Carpets, Tea Gardens etc. v) Historical personality and related sites :- House of writers, painters, social workers, political figures, Freedom Fighters, Kings, Queens, Sports and Film personality. vi) Performing Arts Resources : Theatres, street based performers, Circus, Musical Groups, Dance, Drama, Quawallis etc. vii) Celebrations and related attractions : Fairs and festivals, Processions, Tajiya, Village level competitions, Celebration of Teej, Kajari, Patola, Fast etc. viii) Beliefs related attractions : Trees, shrubs, ponds, mountains, peaks etc. Ownership of these resources lies with society and if the same has been converted into tourism product, consequences (positive or negative) are going to be faced by the society. However, in Travel and Tourism, resources must be converted into Tourism Product .The process of conversion of tourism resources into tourism product should be understood. For converting resources into product, resources must be combined with accessibility, accommodation, transportation, shopping, visitor- interpretation, facilities and services, images, experiences, attitude of host, price and promotion. Chart describes the conversion of society's' resources into tourism product. Indian society has certain problems related to understanding of practices and forms of heritage, culture and tradition. These problems are due to: - Exposure to modern media and outside world which creates a factor of naturalization of practices and forms. Due to exposure, conviction has become very weak. - Parents (ancestors) are not able to explain what they are doing and why present generation should follow it. Finding meaning is very difficult. - There is a problem of \"root\", \"self esteem\" and \"value system\". - Commercial education system is another major problem. Child has a right to grow as a human being but there is no holistic approach. - T h e r e i s a p r o b l e m o f \"Validation\". - Indian society's' heritage, culture and traditions have well defined forms which are present and taught at homes. It may differ from home to home or from society to society. These prevalent forms cannot be understood by modern class room teaching but have to be inculcated in the minds of a person, at home. Heritage of Indian society is combination of all cultural and religious forms, expression, attitudes, mindset, spiritual wisdom and understanding. So, to understand the \"Heritage and Culture\" of Indian soci ety, one must see all aspects of day to day life. Promotion For planning, development and manage ment of travel and tourism sector, it is very much necessary to research typology of tourist who is interested or will be interested in visiting a particular tourism resource / product. Side-by-side, planners will have to find the tourism destination development phase and characteristics of visiting tourist for deciding the type of infrastructure to be developed and marketing strategy to be adopted. Travel and tourism industry is not a single industry but an amalgamation of different industries and mutual cooperation between different segments of travel and tourism industry is very much required. India is a country of young population and is represented as \"I Generation\" (Internet Generation). Technological speed has changed modern travel and tourism phenomena and activity. Now travelers are i) Browsing the web using mobile services for getting all information related to rule/regulations, destination, facility, activity and services, approach and mobility, boo king of transport and accommodation. Will be How society look upon things/happening / incidence etc. Decides Attitude As per understanding This is an attitude and mindset of society This gives forms of expression which has religious connotation Religious understanding is the most important and common Comes from understanding Decides Heritage, Culture Tradition and Forms Can be converted into Heritage Tourism Cultural Tourism Historical Tourism Educational Tourism Alternative Tourism Culinary Tour ism Ethnic Tourism Religious Tourism Village Tourism Social Tour Fig: 162 YOJANA May 2015 ii) They are uploading photos to social networks which give real-time image and status. iii) They are posting updates on social networks and initiate the mouth to mouth publicity. iv) They are finding local activities using mobile devices. Now travel planning and marking related to \"Awareness, Information, Desire, and Action\" is dominated by online resources. In this age \"Social Media\" and \"Peer-To-Peer marketing\" is very important. Travel and tourism sectors will have to be very sensitive towards \"Social Media Fever\" and accordingly change the marketing strategy. Readings 1. Hudman, L.E., D.E.

The portal is accessible at URL -http://efclearance.nic.in. The portal is a single window interface provided to the user agencies for the submission of proposals for Environment, Forest and Wildlife Clearances and facilitates management in effective monitoring. It automates the entire tracking of proposals, including online submission of a new proposal, editing/updating the details of proposals and displays the status of the proposals at each stage of the workflow. The main objectives of the system include enhancing efficiency, transparency and accountability, besides education in turnaround time for activity and enhancing ease and convenience of the citizens. The Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change had initiated an online system for submission and monitoring of Environmental and Forest Clearances under the provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. This had helped in bringing more transparency and accountability. Considering the efficiency of the system, the Ministry has now decided to widen the scope of online processing system to the wildlife clearance system as "}
