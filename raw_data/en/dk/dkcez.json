I'm quite disabled, and I have no idea how disabled I'll end up. That's what MS is like. It's unpredictable, and it's different for everyone. Ask 100 people with MS, and you'll get 100 different sets of symptoms. There are treatments: things that slow down progression, or even halt it in some cases. But the Holy Grail is something that will cure multiple sclerosis, repair the damage our incorrectly primed immune systems are causing to the myelin that coats our nerves, and restore us to full functioning. Faced with the uncertainty of a condition that can manifest itself in many different ways, progress at variable speeds, and have multiple unpredictable endpoints, it's not surprising that we are so prone to grasp at any suggestion of a cure, however improbable it may sound, and however scant the evidence. We still don't know for sure what causes MS, though many things have been suggested, some less likely than others. For instance aspartame, [heavy metals (including dental fillings)](http://www.sharecare.com/health/multiple-sclerosis-causes-risk-factors/fillings-cause-worsen-multiple-sclerosis), and [allergies](http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Living-Well-With-MS/Health-Wellness/Managing-MS-and-Another-Condition/Allergies) have all been debunked as causative agents. Going by current research, multiple factors are actually involved, including [genetics, viruses, environmental factors](http://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/guide/multiple-sclerosis-causes), and [vitamin D deficiency](http://www.mssociety.org.uk/ms-news-and-research/ms-research/potential-treatments/emerging-areas-of-research/vitamin-d). And what of cures? Individual stories, such as that of [Dermot O'Connor](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-393949/I-cured-MS.html) who claims to have cured his MS through diet, exercise, and acupuncture, sadly prove nothing. Multiple sclerosis has relapses and remissions. You get worse then better. So it's always hard to tell whether you're feeling better by chance or because of something you've done, unless it's part of a properly conducted clinical trial. One theory that's gained a lot of publicity over the last few years is [CCSVI](http://jrs.sagepub.com/content/99/11/589.long) - chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency. It's unusual in that it's received attention both from the media and the medical and scientific establishment. The idea runs that compromised flow of blood in the veins draining the central nervous system leads to [iron deposits around the pulmonary veins](http://jrs.sagepub.com/content/99/11/589.long), which triggers autoimmunity and degeneration of myelin. The study that first proposed the theory of CCSVI, [carried out in 2008 by Paolo Zamboni](http://jrs.sagepub.com/content/99/11/589.long), was interesting but had a number of methodological issues. It was inevitably small, it was non-randomised and non-blinded, participants remained on their usual treatments during the trial so it was impossible to identify the cause of any effect, and all participants were in relapse, so were likely to improve anyway. The study found venous abnormalities in every one of the participants, a result that automatically sets suspicious Spidey senses tingling in researchers. And when Dr Zamboni had the blockages cleared using angioplasty, his paper quoted outcome results at six months post-procedure, with most showing an improvement. At 18 months, on the other hand, his participants were doing the same or even worse than they had before the intervention. Moreover, there is a potential [conflict of interest](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.23560/abstract;jsessionid=0E65A923A076C79AA0F3A7BAE0669323.f01t02) in Zamboni owning the patent relating to the diagnostic equipment used for diagnosing CCSVI, or the support his research centre has received from its manufacturer in the form of equipment and technical assistance. But the work certainly merited further research, to see if CCSVI did indeed exist, if there was a link between it and MS, and if so, whether angioplasty to clear the blockage could help MS. News of the study soon reached the MS community, and many individuals with MS, impressed by the reported results, wanted angioplasty straight away. As there was insufficient evidence for health authorities to fund the treatment, people have been travelling to private clinics in Poland, Puerto Rico, or Thailand, often remortgaging their houses or undertaking months of fundraising to raise the thousands of pounds necessary. Results were reported back on social media, often on YouTube. But, of course, individual uncontrolled anecdotes do not equate to evidence. And even Zamboni himself was urging a go-slow approach, telling people with MS to [enrol on clinical trials](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/liberation-therapy-doctor-now-warning-ms-patients-to-wait/article1760040/) rather than have the treatment done privately. And was the treatment safe? In most cases, it seems to be. But there have been incidents of possible side effects, including [intercranial haemorrhage](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/180802.php), [thrombosis](http://jevtonline.org/doi/abs/10.1583/11-3440.1), [compression of cranial Canadian [Mahir Mostic](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/man-dies-after-controversial-ms-treatment-doctor-says/article1314585/). [Trials at Stanford University were halted](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/180802.php) after one participant died and another needed emergency surgery to remove a stent that had migrated into their heart. Meanwhile, research was being done. And it wasn't good news for the CCSVI advocates. So far, [no significant difference has been found in the presence of CCSVI in people with and without MS](http://www.mssociety.org.uk/ms-news-and-research/ms-research/potential-treatments/emerging-areas-of-research/ccsvi/research-and-next-steps). A controlled and blinded [sham surgery trial](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-03/uab-mpd031413.php) of the angioplasty procedure found no benefit from the intervention. Research continues, as indeed it should. But I'm not hopeful. Will there be a cure for multiple sclerosis? Eventually, yes I think there will. But I think it will come via [stem cell research](http://www.mssociety.org.uk/ms-research/new-and-potential-treatments/stem-cell-therapy). Prevention of MS, and many other diseases, will be achieved through [vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/10686624/Vitamin-D-could-it-stop-modern-diseases.html). And only after detailed clinical trials to show efficacy and safety. Naturally. Margo Milne "}
