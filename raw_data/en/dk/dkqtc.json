The central theme of this very important process is reflection \u2014a concept we understand instinctively at SLU. Indeed, reflection is one of the fundamental hallmarks of a Jesuit education. It also is at the heart of Ignati an Spirituality developed by St. Ignatius Loyola \u2014the founder of the Society of Jesus \u2014more than 450 years ago. Although the idea of reflection is not new for us, developing this accreditation report, Magis: Advancing Mission into Saint Louis University's Third Century , allowed us to see ourselves and our great institution in a new light. And, as its name suggests, this report is much more than a review of our past. It is a roadmap for our future. At Saint Louis University, we are guided by a mission tha t values and promotes academic excellence, student - centered learning, life -changing research, expert and compassionate health care, spiritual formation, and a strong commitment to service and social justice. As this report reveals, our mission is not onl y alive and well at SLU after nearly 200 years, it is thriving! I encourage you to read on. Learn more about how Saint Louis University is moving forward into its next century with an unwavering commitment to informing, forming and transforming future l eaders in the Catholic, Jesuit tradition.

Coupled with the sub -title, however, Magis captures both the historic roots of our institutional mission and our vision for the future. Indeed, the mission of Sai nt Louis University is rooted in a 450 year -old tradition of Jesuit education originating in the Renaissance and embodying the humanism in which Ignatius Loyola and the other founders of the Society of Jesus were themselves educated. Magis was a word Igna tius used often, as he drove himself and encouraged others to be more so they could do more. They did so in the service of others, and all for the greater glory of God (the motto of both the University and the Society of Jesus: ad majorem Dei gloriam). Saint Louis University's most recent HLC/NCA self -study, published in 2002, was titled A Decade of Renaissance . Appropriately, it was focused on SLU's successes channeling its Renaissance humanistic origins through a modern institutional renaissance in the 1990s. But as the Self -Study Planning Team contemplated themes for this 2012 Self -Study, they sought to accentuate the University's future in a manner that complemented the new accreditation criteria introduced by the HLC in 2005. Those criteria, gr ounded in institutional strategic planning and the full cycle of assessment, reflect key elements of traditional Ignatian pedagogy: context, experience, reflection, action and evaluation \u2014all of which, when engaged in with critical discipline, support our p ursuit of the Magis . Magis also connotes a striving toward the future, a refusal to be satisfied with the status quo . With an institutional eye on 2018, the year of SLU's bicentennial anniversary, we have begun reflecting on and planning for how SLU wil l advance its mission into and throughout its third century. More specifically, University leaders have embarked on new strategic planning efforts designed to both build upon the successes resulting from our 2001 Strategic Plan and ensure the institution al capacity to address contemporary and future global challenges. Within Jesuit tradition, the Magis is related to another distinctive Ignatian practice, discernment. As we pursue lives committed to the greater glory of God, Jesuit tradition calls us to discern what constitutes the greater good for humankind, making a considered judgment on what action will result in a more beneficial and righteous outcome. Discernment means weighing options in making decisions, looking to where there is greater nee d, and where efforts can be most constructive. This echoes at SLU a renewed emphasis on planning, prioritization, and prudent allocation of human and fiscal resources. Discernment in support of the Magis also means learning from each other's successes and failures, and the collection and analysis of evidence to demonstrate whether or not SLU remains true to its mission and is advancing toward its vision. In other words, the concepts of discernment for the sake of the Magis and outcomes assessment for t he sake of institutional integrity and advancement mean that efforts toward creating a culture of assessment throughout the University are fully in accord with our historic mission. Magis describes in a word what this Self -Study attempts to demonstrate in detail. It embodies the individual and institutional humility required to commit, for the next 100 years, Saint Louis University to the service of others for the greater glory of God. 8 Chapter I: Overview of Self -Study Document and Process Self-Study Process For Saint Louis University (SLU), thi s Self -Study process has been a four -year endeavor involving numerous faculty, staff, administrators, and students throughout the institution and in an array of capacities. One significant outcome of this process, beyond this Self -Study Report presented t o the Higher Learning Commission (HLC), is a more integrated perspective of our institution \u2014not only by the individuals who most directly contributed to the process as committee members, but also by those who participated in the process as discussants, con sultants, and readers. The new (2005) HLC Criteria for Accreditation addressed by Saint Louis University in this document necessitated thinking across traditional boundaries (real and perceived). The criteria challenged us to think about who we are and what we do \u2014and don't do \u2014not simply in terms of formal structures such as departments and operating functions, but in thematic ways that cut across the University. A second, and related, important outcome is the identification of the last decade's succe sses, as well as the challenges that impact and, in some cases, impede, our ability to achieve the Magis \u2014\"the more.\" We have been enriched by the discussions of the criteria and have a greater understanding of how the University does and might better fun ction in ways that are both consonant with the criteria and allow SLU to position itself for the future which, in just six years, will see SLU celebrate its 200th anniversary. Initial Planning In September 2008, the Vice President for Academic Affairs (VP AA) appointed a self -study Planning Team consisting of two associate vice presidents, one of whom was SLU's HLC liaison; the staff assistant in the vice president's office; representatives from the Divisions of Business and Finance, Facilities, and Stu dent Development; a representative from the Department of Campus Ministry the leaders of the Faculty Senate, Staff Advisory Committee (SAC), and Student Government Association (SGA); the dean who chaired our 2002 self -study; and a faculty member with ex perience as an HLC consultant -evaluator (hereafter referred to as \"SLU HLC consultant\"). The Planning Team met approximately every two weeks from September 2008 through February 2009. It determined the Self -Study theme, the general structure of the Self -Study Report and Self -Study Steering Committee, the characteristics desired in the criterion subcommittee chairpersons along with potential recommendations for personnel, and a preliminary timeline for completion of the Self -Study Report. The goals of the process were established as follows: Assess SLU's effectiveness in advancing its mission; Gather substantive evidence to tell the SLU story and demonstrate that the Criteria for Accreditation are met; Inform strategic planning by proposing institutional strategies to address identified challenges and to take advantage of opportunities for improvement; Engage in active organizational learning; Strengthen the SLU community by creating opportunities for widespread and in -depth engagement in the process and b y integrating the knowledge and expertise of stakeholders; and Achieve continued accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools 9 Chapter I: Overview of Self -Study Document and Process The language of the goals was chosen deliberately to underscore k ey aspects of the current institutional emphases (i.e., assessment, evidence, demonstration, strategic planning, and organizational engagement) and to reflect the Planning Team's cognizance of ways in which elements of this process had changed substantiall y since the previous self -study. Steering Committee and Self -Study Timeline The Planning Team recommended a steering committee of sixteen members: a chair, criterion co -chairs, a student representative, a coordinator (SLU's HLC Liaison), a writer, a web s upport person, and an administrative support person. Furthermore, the team proposed that a subcommittee be constituted for each criterion, and that the subcommittees be chaired by their respective criterion co -chairs. In addition, specific individuals w ere recommended for the positions of chair, student representative, and criterion co -chairs. The Planning Team developed a preliminary timeline consistent with the guidelines in the HLC Handbook of Accreditation (3rd ed.). See Appendix A for the final Se lf-Study timeline that establishes the beginning of our process in September 2008 and culminates with the HLC Consultant -Evaluator site team visit to St. Louis from April 23 to April 25, 2012. Moving Forward The Steering Committee chair and an associate v ice president who served on the Planning Team attended the PEAQ Workshop on Self Study held on April 18 -19 in conjunction with the 2009 Annual Conference of the Higher Learning Commission. The workshop sessions were valuable in providing an overview of th e self - study process as well as practical information and guidance about organizing a self -study and involving the campus community. The opportunities to discuss real experiences and aspects of their respective self -study reports with representatives of o ther institutions, especially at the resource fair, further contributed to a holistic understanding of the process that the attendees subsequently shared with and incorporated into the Steering Committee's work. By May 6, 2009, the date of the Steering Co mmittee's kickoff meeting with the VPAA, the composition of the committee had been modified as a result of additional consultation, discussion, and staffing changes in the Office of the Vice President. While the heart of the original structure had been re tained (i.e., chair, student representative, HLC liaison, and criterion co -chairs), the Steering Committee structure continued to evolve over the next several months. Although the individuals serving in several of the positions have changed due to departu res from the University or modifications of their regular University responsibilities, the structure of the Steering Committee has remained stable since mid -2010, i.e., Chair HLC liaison Student representative Criterion subcommittee co -chairs (ten) Madri d subcommittee chair SLU HLC consultants (two) Administrative support person who also serves as webmaster (i.e., the coordinator from the VPAA's office) It was determined early on that the Self -Study and the University would benefit greatly by having SLU' s Madrid campus directly represented on the Steering Committee through Madrid's academic dean. This dean, in turn, constituted a subcommittee of Madrid faculty and staff that reported to him and had, among its members, liaisons to each of the criterion su bcommittees. These changes ensured inclusion of the Madrid campus far beyond that experienced in the 2002 self -study. See Appendix A for a summary of finalized Self - Study roles and responsibilities. 10 Chapter I: Overview of Self -Study Document and Process Publicity for the current Self -Study also began on May 6, 2009, with an article in Newslink , SLU's official online source for University -wide news, published daily between Monday and Friday. Titled University Begins to Prepare for Self -Study and Reaccreditation , this article announced the theme, goals, HLC Criteria for Accreditation, and Steering Committee members. Conducting the Self -Study The work on SLU's Self -Study from this point can be described as having been accomplished in four phases. Each phase featured both distinctive activity and activity com mon to all phases. At various points throughout the process, the Steering Committee discussed core curricula issues and heard about and/or discussed proposed plans for and updates on new SLU strategic planning and institutional assessment initiatives. St eering Committee and subcommittee meeting agenda and minutes are available in the resource room. Phase I: Summer 2009 - Spring 2010 The main Self -Study related activities during the summer and early fall of 2009 were the constitution of the five criterion subcommittees and the Madrid subcommittee and the establishment of an institutional accreditation website . The Steering Committee chair and the associate vice president who served on the Planning Team and attended the PEAQ Workshop continued the identification of potential subcommittee members, consulting with these individuals' respective deans and vice presidents as well as the subcommittee chairs. Selections were based on representation of specific of fices and functions, prior accreditation experience at any level, length of SLU employment, and breadth of SLU experience. Subcommittee appointments were finalized through letters of invitation from the VPAA. The six subcommittees, as initially formed, h ad 80 members. In addition, members of the President's Executive Staff Committee were designated as liaisons to specific subcommittees. Two significant events related to SLU's Self -Study efforts occurred early in Phase I. The first was the departure f rom SLU of the University's HLC liaison and the appointment of a new HLC liaison, previously an assistant vice president in the Office of the VPAA. Like his predecessor, the new HLC liaison also has responsibility for institutional accreditation and the U niversity's Office of Institutional Research. His active participation in the current Self -Study process began immediately upon appointment. With the December 2009 return to the full -time faculty of the associate vice president, he teamed with the Steeri ng Committee chair to lead the Self -Study effort. The second event was the appointment, effective August 1, 2009, of a new (interim and eventually permanent) VPAA, following the July resignation of his predecessor. The Steering Committee chair and assoc iate vice president met with the new vice president to bring him up to date on the University's Self -Study activities, timelines, and support needs. SLU's institutional accreditation website was establishe d in fall 2009. Permanent website features include the SLU Self -Study theme, goals, and timeline; committee rosters, HLC Criteria for Accreditation; and an archive of documents related to the 2002 institutional self -study. During Phase I, the Steering Co mmittee met seven times. Fall 2009 meetings were devoted to discussion of roles and responsibilities, subcommittee direction and procedures (e.g., meeting minutes, calendaring), budget support, articulation with Madrid, the gathering and availability of n eeded documents, review of other institutions' self -study reports, and publicity. The HLC liaison developed a model for framing discussions based on the assessment cycle as well as a template for the subcommittees to use in organizing their recommendation s for content. The Steering Committee engaged in lengthy discussion about the Self -Study theme, Magis , and how it was emerging in the work of the subcommittees. The final meeting in May featured a review of the 2010 HLC PEAQ self-study workshop, atten ded by seven Steering Committee members. In addition to coming away with practical information, the attendees' consensus was that the workshop reinforced their sense that SLU is at an appropriate stage in its self-study process. 11 Chapter I: Overview of Self -Study Document and Process The five criterion subcommittees were charged with the eventual drafting of their respective chapters. Their initial work, begun in November 2009 and continuing throughout the academic year, involved translating their respective HLC criteria into terms that made sense for SL U and identifying needed documents or other information to aid the successful achievement of their charge. All subcommittee members received a binder of core materials, which were reviewed with them by their chairs at the outset of their work. Other institutions' self -study reports helped guide the subcommittees in their understanding of how the criteria might be interpreted. The subcommittees were reminded of the need to be evaluative in their presentations of information in the Self -Study Report. They were encouraged to think creatively about their respective criteria and formulate questions. The subcommittees' work culminated in late spring 2010 with their submission to the Steering Committee chair and HLC liaison of lists of potential topics for inc lusion in their chapters. SLU's HLC staff liaison, Dr. John Taylor, visited the St. Louis campus on October 7 -8, 2009. The purposes of Dr. Taylor's visit were to share information and engage the SLU community in dialogue about the institution, significan t higher education issues related to accreditation, the PEAQ self -study and peer review process, and the HLC's decision -making process. He accomplished this through meetings with the Steering Committee leadership, the President's Coordinating Council (PCC ) and Council of Academic Deans and Directors (CADD), the vice presidents with academic responsibilities, the Steering Committee, and a presentation to the SLU community at large. Publicity and general public discussion about the Self -Study and the Univ ersity's preparation took multiple forms (all campus units were informed, through the vice presidents and deans as well as general news outlets, of the Steering Committee's willingness to make presentations to their units): (a) Newslink articles: General S elf-Study Announcement (May 6, 2009) and Official Launch/Taylor Visit Announcement (September 30, 2009) (b) President's October 2009 message to the SLU community (c) Presentations by the Steering Committee chair and HLC liaison to Student Government Assoc iation (SGA) Academic Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees Faculty Senate President's Coordinating Council (PCC) Department/Division Chairs Library Faculty Assembly Staff Advisory Committee: SAC (d) St. Louis campus conversation sessions for faculty and staff about the HLC Criteria for Accreditation, led by the Steering Committee chair and HLC liaison (April 28 and May 5, 2010) (e) Conversation sessions with Student Government Association members (April 20, 26, and 30, 2010) Phase II: Summer 2010 - Spring 2011 During summer 2010, the Steering Committee chair, HLC liaison, and the coordinator met at length to review and provide feedback on the extensive lists of potential Self -Study report content submitted by the criterion and Madrid subcommittees. T his work encompassed consideration of the relevance of specific topics to the HLC Criteria, inclusion of related information from the Madrid campus (aided by the Madrid Steering Committee member's subsequent review of the subcommittee submissions), and ide ntification of likely information sources. Based on the subcommittees' input, and the HLC's list of documents the site visit team will expect to find in the resource room, the Steering Committee chair compiled checklists of documents needed for about 30 s pecific entities within SLU and consulted with the vice presidents and deans to identify individuals within each entity who would be responsible for gathering those documents and providing them to the Steering Committee coordinator. Next, the chair, HLC l iaison, and coordinator met with each of the designated persons to provide background and rationale, and answer questions. This task brought more than 20 additional people directly into SLU's HLC Self -Study process. As materials were 12 Chapter I: Overview of Self -Study Document and Process submitted, the coor dinator scanned into PDF any documents that were not already in electronic format, and organized all the incoming documents for subcommittee use in a virtual resource room on a shared server. The Executive Staff Committee also had access to these material s, as well as to the Steering Committee and subcommittee files. The Steering Committee met six times during Phase II. The fall 2010 meetings were devoted primarily to discussion of the subcommittee content drafts including further inclusion of Madrid inf ormation, resource room development, the process (including worksheets) and expectations going forward, publicity, and the September 2010 HLC retreat on the St. Louis campus. The spring 2011 meetings focused on planning for the criterion open fora and cl arifying needs for the late spring submission of the criterion chapter drafts. The September 10, 2010, half -day HLC retreat brought together all the Steering Committee and criterion subcommittee members to review the summer activity, provide structure and direction for the coming year's work, and kick off the subcommittee meetings for the year. On September 27, 2010, the Steering Committee chair and HLC liaison participated in a videoconference with the Madrid subcommittee to cover the retreat material. Throughout the fall, the criterion subcommittees worked to refine their potential chapter content and develop annotated outlines to serve as previews of the Self -Study content to the University community in spring 2011. The elements of each outline were a chapter introduction, thesis statement(s) for each of the criterion core components, recommendations, and a list of information sources consulted/needed. Two open fora for each criterion, one on each end of the local campus, were scheduled for the St . Louis SLU community during February and March 2011. A forum covering all the criteria was held on the Madrid campus on April 4, 2011. Newslink ran announcements and reminders of each session, as did the Weekly E - Note distributed by the Office of the VP AA, to vice presidents, deans, and directors. The pertinent annotated outline was posted on the SLU institutional accreditation website prior to each session with a link to an online feedback form; the outlines were archived on the website following the s eries. The sessions, conducted by the subcommittee chairs, were sparsely attended but the individuals who did participate engaged in lively conversation and contributed helpful feedback. The subcommittees continued the work of drafting their criterion cha pters through the remainder of spring 2011. Their chapter drafts were submitted to the Steering Committee chair and HLC liaison at the end of May. Publicity and general public discussion about the Self -Study and the University's preparation took multiple forms: (a) Creation of a graphic element to be used as branding on all HLC Self -Study documents and website (b) Newslink articles: Open fora dialogues general announcement with dates (January 31, 2010) and follow -up announcements for each forum (Criteri on 1 - February 18 and March 9; Criterion 2 - March 4 and March 25; Criterion 3 - February 16 and March 21; Criterion 4 - March 7; Criterion 5 - February 11 and March 28) (c) Weekly E -Note announcements of the open fora dialogues from the Office of the VPA A (February 11 and 18; March 4, 18, and 25) (d University News article Accreditation Team to Assess SLU's Status (February 24, 2011), based on interviews with Steering Committee chair and student representative (e) President's April 2011 message to the SL U community (f) Presentations by the Steering Committee chair and HLC liaison to President's Coordinating Council (PCC) Council of Academic Deans and Directors (CADD) Faculty Assembly of the College of Education and Public Service School of Nursing Facult y Assembly 13 Chapter I: Overview of Self -Study Document and Process Faculty Senate Facilities Services Administrative Staff School of Medicine Executive Committee of the Faculty Staff Advisory Committee (SAC) Student Government Association (SGA) (g) University News ad: May 5 (h) Open fora dialogues on the St. Lo uis campus on criterion annotated outlines, led by the subcommittee chairs (Criterion 1 - February 21 and March 10; Criterion 2 - March 7 and March 28; Criterion 3 - February 17 and March 22; Criterion 4 - March 8; Criterion 5 - February 15 and March 29) (i) SLU institutional accreditation website featured announcements of the open fora dialogues held in spring 2011 as well as links to the outlines (the outlines subsequently were archived on the website) and online feedback form Phase III: Summer 2011 - Fall 2011 During summer 2011, the Steering Committee chair and HLC liaison reviewed the initial criterion chapter drafts submitted by the subcommittees, and continued to add materials to the resource room. The Steering Committee chair and HLC liaison next m et with each team of subcommittee chairs to discuss the drafts in detail; the chairs subsequently revised and submitted second drafts in mid -fall. At this point, the Steering Committee chair and HLC liaison, who had initiated work on the other report chap ters, began editing/rewriting the criterion chapter drafts. They and the coordinator consulted with the publications director of the University's Department of Marketing and Communications who designed the report layout. In his November 21, 2011, message dedicated to the topic of the Self -Study, the President announced the forthcoming posting of the preliminary drafts of the criterion chapters and the dates of open fora focusing on them, encouraging all members of the University community to actively part icipate in this phase of the process. An ad was placed in the November 27, 2011, issue of The University News as a reminder. The preliminary criterion chapter drafts were posted for review on SLU's institutional accreditation website in early December 20 11, along with a link to an online feedback form. Four open fora were conducted by the Steering Committee chair and HLC liaison on the St. Louis campus; they held a videoconference with Madrid subcommittee members as well. Newslink ran announcements an d reminders of each session, as did the Weekly E -Note distributed by the Office of the VPAA, to vice presidents, deans, and directors. The subcommittee chairs invited feedback from their membership and the other Steering Committee members also were asked to provide feedback. To focus the refinement of the chapter drafts, readers were asked to specifically consider these questions: 1. Does this draft include any factual errors or false claims? 2. Does this draft include any glaring omissions or unnecessary inc lusions? 3. Do you have suggestions for additional initiatives SLU might consider to build upon the strengths outlined in this draft? 4. Do you have suggestions for additional initiatives SLU might consider to address the challenges outlined in this draft? Discussions at these fora \u2014which had much better attendance than those of spring 2011 \u2014and the comments submitted via the online feedback form were very constructive. The Steering Committee met once during Phase III, in December, to recap the prior months' acti vities, discuss feedback to the preliminary criterion chapter drafts and other aspects of the Self -Study Report, and project the related activities for Phase IV, in spring 2012. 14 Chapter I: Overview of Self -Study Document and Process Publicity and general public discussion about the Self -Study and the Universi ty's preparation took multiple forms: (a) Newslink articles: Criterion chapter drafts availability and open fora dialogues general announcement with dates(December 2, 2011) and follow -up announcements for each forum (December 5, 6, 7, 8, and 12) (b) Week ly E-Note announcements of the criterion chapter drafts availability and open fora dialogues from the Office of the VPAA (December 2 and 9) (c) University News article University Gears Up for Reaccreditation (October 13, 2011), based on interview with Steering Committee chair and HLC liaison (d) President's November 21, 2011, message to the SLU community (e) Presentations by the Steering Committee chair and HLC liaison to Executive Staff Committee School for Professional Studies Faculty and Staff Leaders (Student) of the Pack Retreat Academic Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees Council of Academic Deans and Directors (CADD) Student Government Association (SGA) Staff Advisory Committee (SAC) Department/Division Chairs Faculty Senate Academic Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees (f) University News ads: September 8 and November 27 (g) Open fora dialogues on the St. Louis campus on preliminary drafts of criterion chapters, led by the Steering Committee chair and HLC liaison (December 6, 7, 8, and 12) (h) Videoconference with Madrid subcommittee members, led by the Steering Committee chair and HLC liaison (December 15, 2011) (i) SLU institutional accreditation website featured announcements of the open fora dialogues held in fall 2011 as well as li nks to the preliminary drafts of the criterion chapters and online feedback form Phase IV: Spring 2012 The Steering Committee chair and HLC liaison reviewed the feedback received from the University community on the preliminary chapter drafts posted in De cember 2011 and incorporated it as appropriate. Upon completion, drafts of the revised criterion chapters as well as the other report chapters, including appendices, were provided to the Steering Committee, President's Coordinating Council (PCC), Council of Academic Deans and Directors (CADD), and Board of Trustees for review and feedback. Additional revisions were made accordingly and the Steering Committee chair, HLC liaison, and the coordinator prepared the final report document. A public notice invit ing third -party comment about SLU was published on SLU's institutional accreditation website, in the Sunday, January 22, 2012, edition of the St. Louis Post -Dispatch , the major metropolitan daily newspaper, in the January 26, 2012, edition of The Universit y News , SLU's weekly student newspaper, and on Newslink on January 31 and February 6, 2012. Announcements with links to the website notice were distributed via the Weekly E -Note on January 27 and in emails to the leaders of the Faculty Senate, Student Government Association, and Staff Advisory Committee who were asked to direct their respective constituents to the website. Additionally, e -newsletters distributed to the alumni of the University's colleges and schools contained an announcement linking to th e website.

The University seeks excellence in the fulfillment of its corporate purposes of teaching, research, health care and service to the community. It is dedicated to leadership in the continuing quest for understanding of God's creati on and for the discovery, dissemination and integration of the values, knowledge and skills required to transform society in the spirit of the Gospels. As a Catholic, Jesuit university, this pursuit is motivated by the inspiration and values of the Judeo -Christian tradition and is guided by the spiritual and intellectual ideals of the Society of Jesus. In support of its mission, the University: Encourages and supports innovative scholarship and effective teaching in all fields of the arts; the humanitie s; the natural, health and medical sciences; the social sciences; the law; business; aviation; and technology. Creates an academic environment that values and promotes free, active and original intellectual inquiry among its faculty and students. Fosters programs that link University resources to local, national and international communities in collaborative efforts to alleviate ignorance, poverty, injustice and hunger; extend compassionate care to the ill and needy; and maintain and improve the quality o f life for all persons. Strives continuously to seek means to build upon its Catholic, Jesuit identity and to promote activities that apply its intellectual and ethical heritage to work for the good of society as a whole. Welcomes students, faculty and s taff from all racial, ethnic and religious backgrounds and beliefs and creates a sense of community that facilitates their development as men and women for others. Nurtures within its community an understanding of and commitment to the promotion of faith and justice in the spirit of the Gospels. Wisely allocates its resources to maintain efficiency and effectiveness in attaining its mission and goals. Presidential Vision Saint Louis University's president, Fr. Lawrence Biondi, S.J., has authored the fol lowing vision for the University: My vision is to establish and maintain Saint Louis University as the finest Catholic university in the United States, wherein the entire University community is actively engaged in student formation. Challenged by outstan ding faculty and a modern, value -centered curriculum reflecting the Jesuit tradition, students are fully prepared to contribute to society and to be effective leaders of social change based on the ethical values and principles taught in the Saint Louis Uni versity tradition. 22 Chapter II: University Overview University Administration Rev.

Teasdale Marvin Wool Historical Context and Key Changes, 2002 -2012 Historical Context It was in 1818 \u2014just twelve years after Lewis and Clark reached the frontier city of St. Louis on the return leg of their historic western expedition \u2014that Bishop Louis William DuBourg established St. Louis as his diocesan seat a nd built St. Louis College there. Although the College didn't come under the control of the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) until 1826, Saint Louis University always has acknowledged 1818 as the date of its origin. SLU became just the second Jesuit -operat ed university in the United States, following Georgetown University (as Georgetown College) in 1789. When SLU received its formal charter from the State of Missouri in 1832, it officially became the oldest University west of the Mississippi River. Like other Jesuit educational institutions throughout the world, SLU's curriculum was based on a plan of studies developed around 1551 by St. Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, and formulated in the Ratio Studiorum (i.e., the Method and System of the St udies of the Society of Jesus), promulgated in 1599. From its earliest days, this value -centered approach to education has been a signature of SLU's efforts to teach students to be practical, socially responsible, humanistic, and spiritual individuals. The establishment of a medical department in 1842 and a law department in 1843 \u2014the latter recognized as the oldest law school west of the Mississippi \u2014reflected the Jesuit emphasis on practical and socially responsible education. A century later, in 1944, and fully consonant with the values grounding its educational programs, the University achieved the distinction of becoming the first historically white institution of higher learning in a former slave state to admit persons of color as students. Brown v. Board of Education was ten years down the road. SLU also broke barriers facing women in higher education. The School of Law first admitted women in 1908, the School of Commerce and Finance (now the John Cook School of Business) enrolled women from its own 1910 beginning, and women also were included when the Graduate School was formally established in 1924. And in 1925, SLU opened the School of Education featuring requirements and exams identical to those of the College of Arts and Sciences. This was d one to provide women with a strong liberal arts and sciences undergraduate education at a time when the Jesuit Father General in Rome directed that women not be enrolled in the College with men. It wasn't until 1949 that SLU's female students could offici ally enroll in the College of Arts and Sciences. Sixty -six years later, women constitute 58% of the Class of 2014. SLU's history well into the 20th century was characterized by the University's determination to be true to its founding principles while adapting \u2014and, indeed, leading \u2014in the face of external change. SLU's enrollments experienced a different kind of influence when WWII veterans returned home and attended college. To help meet the ensuing demand, quonset hut classrooms were erected in the q uad adjacent to DuBourg Hall. SLU's continued commitment to the provision of education to military veterans is reflected today in its being named for three consecutive years as one of G.I. Jobs' \"Military Friendly Schools.\" The University's attentions in the mid -1970s largely turned inward, as its leadership endeavored to address the significant financial challenges confronting the institution. As was noted in the Introduction and Overview to our 2002 HLC self -study report, those challenges were met and provided the foundation for the Decade of Renaissance that was the focus of that report. When SLU's current president, Lawrence Biondi, S.J., took office in 1987, he immediately began to build upon the University's newly established financial stabilit y. He 24 Chapter II: University Overview inherited an endowment of $141 million (up from $57 million ten years prior) and an institution that not only was ready to enhance its standing in teaching, research, and service, as well as its physical plant, but was newly committed to the improve ment of the neighboring midtown St. Louis area. The claim that SLU became and continues to be largely responsible for the revitalization of this part of the city is no overstatement. Key among the many notable accomplishments of the 1992 -2002 period were the Carnegie Foundation's classification of SLU as a Research -Extensive University; a shift from a primarily commuter to a residential campus; and the establishment of a national profile that attracted both more and higher -achieving students than ever bef ore. Considerable progress also was made in the areas of academics, facilities, and information technology. Many of the advances in these latter areas were outcomes of the strategic five -year, $100 million ($36 million from the endowment) initiative call ed Project SLU2000, begun in 1999, which focused on continued academic excellence, as well as an enhanced campus physical environment and technological infrastructure. While Project SLU2000 officially concluded in the early 2000s, its impact extends to th e present through both continued attention to the foci of its varied initiatives as well as the University's strategic planning process now underway. SLU's geographic roots have always been in the city of St. Louis, where its campus now encompasses 268 acres, but the University also has a long -established international focus that has provided the basis for its ongoing international interests and anticipated newly expanded global presence. From its beginnings as a small study abroad program in the 1960s, the University's operations in Madrid experienced growth that allowed Spanish and European students to complete their first two years of undergraduate studies at that location. Holding the distinction of being the American Jesuit university in Spain, the University decided to build a campus in Madrid and purchased its first buildings there in 1990. In 1996, SLU became the first U.S. university to receive official recognition from the Consejer\u00eda de Educaci\u00f3n y Cultura , Madrid's higher education authority. Since then, its study abroad programming has been complemented by offerings of accredited degree programs. In the last decade especially, the administrative and curricular bonds between the St. Louis and Madrid campuses have become ever closer, with Sain t Louis University being recognized as a center of international education in Spain. Key Changes and Events : 2002 -2012 In the ten years since the publication of our last self -study report, A Decade of Renaissance , Saint Louis University has continued to b uild upon its Catholic, Jesuit heritage and the values espoused by St. Ignatius Loyola and his fellow Jesuits over five hundred years ago. In what has been \u2014and continues to be \u2014a turbulent decade economically, SLU has emerged stronger in significant areas of its operations. The 2002 Consultant -Evaluator Report said that Project SLU 2000 is a bold, far reaching improvement program that allocated significant new monies to various aspects of the University. The initiative was somewhat of a risk, but has pai d off well to date. Project SLU2000 spending ended in FY 2004 as originally intended and the economic fallout of the September 11, 2001, tragedy and subsequent global events made the hoped -for increased endowment draw too risky. Even so, the University h as been successful in continuing many aspects of the Project SLU2000 initiative, which had academics at its heart. For example: Bolster student recruitment and increase student retention: in FY2011, SLU's student -faculty ratio was 12:1 and its average cl ass size was 23.6. Increase scholarship aid to both attract more qualified first -year students and retain existing students: SLU's institutional commitment to financial aid for all student categories was $132M in FY 2011, compared with $52M in FY 2002. Increase the number of graduate assistantships: The decentralization of graduate education, implemented in 2010, is helping to achieve this goal, as well as fund the students holding these positions at a higher level. Establish a designated research fund for seed grants and bridge funds for research: Annually since 2009, $1M is made available through a competitive process for these types of research; the initial 25 Chapter II: University Overview ROI has been $5:1. Further, the Division of Research Administration has been extensively reorganiz ed since 2005 to better meet the needs of faculty and students to effectively seek and manage externally sponsored projects. Project SLU2000 also included major investment in the University's facilities and informati on technology infrastructures. Faciliti es initiatives included upgrades in classrooms, laboratories, and residence halls; improved routine maintenance; and the implementation of energy conservation programs that also improve the University's internal environment. Project reports from the Divis ion of Facilities Services detail the continued and extensive attention given the St. Louis physical plant since 2002. The Division's sustainability efforts have taken major steps forward via with SLU's Center for Sustainability. Information technology initiatives have included enhancement of the campus network, the implementation of ongoing hardware and software renewal, and improved IT support. Additional changes noted in the following year -by-year list offer a glimpse of how Saint Louis University has progressed over the past decade. Chapters III -VII of this report, Magis: Advancing Mission into Saint Louis University's Third Century , offer both a more detailed perspective of these and other milestones and a view into how the University's renewed str ategic planning initiative positions it to remain true to its mission while achieving the more. 2002 The Saint Louis University Museum of Art (SLUMA) opened in the historic Beaux Arts style building that formerly housed the Graduate School and School of Public Health. Per its mission statement, SLU enriches the aesthetic component of a SLU education through the display of diverse cultural worlds and the sponsorship of educational programs related to the arts. SLU opened its hotel, the Water Tower Inn. 2003 Significant renovations totaling $22M to the Busch Student Center were completed. The SLU Employer Assisted Housing Program was established to encourage faculty and staff to live in neighborhoods close to SLU, spurring redevelopment in those areas. The Banner system was selected to replace the University's 25 -year old administrative information systems. The SLU Lay Center for Education and the Arts, a 350 -acre wooded property in Louisiana, MO, opened. SLU's Center for Vaccine Development received an NIH grant totaling $17.95M. 2004 The School for Professional Studies became part of the College of Public Service. Eleonore Stump, holder of the Robert J. Henle, S.J. Chair of Philosophy, was named recipient of Baylor University's Robert Foster Cherry Aw ard for Great Teaching, the nation's preeminent award given to an individual for teaching. 2005 The Schools of Nursing and Allied Health Professions merged to form the Doisy College of Health Sciences. The School of Social Work merged with the College of Public Service. Saint Louis University left Conference USA and joined the Atlantic 10 Conference. Dr. Robert Belshe, director of the Center for Vaccine Development at the School of Medicine, was named as one of Scientific American 's 50 for 2005: Leaders S haping the Future of Technology, for his research on flu vaccines. 26 Chapter II: University Overview 2006 The University's wireless network was extended campus -wide, including residence halls, and subsequently was upgraded to include outdoor access. The SLU women's soccer team claime d the University's first Atlantic -10 regular season and conference tournament titles, and became the first SLU women's sports team to play in an NCAA tournament. 2007 The Doisy Research Center opened; at $82M, it is the largest construction project in the University's history to date. The School for Professional Studies became a freestanding unit, splitting off from the College of Public Service which was renamed the College of Education and Public Service. Renovation of DuBourg Hall's fourth floor was com pleted, providing more office and meeting space. Significant campus safety and emergency preparedness initiatives were launched. 2008 Chaifetz Arena opened, providing a long -desired home -court advantage for SLU's competitive basketball and volleyball team s. This facility has received kudos not only from event attendees, but from industry publications such as Venues Today . An $8M student -driven expansion and renovation of the Simon Recreational Center was completed. The School of Nursing again became a fre estanding academic unit. The University -wide transition of e -mail and calendaring to Google Apps was completed, creating more effective and efficient communication among students, faculty and staff. SLUCare, began its transition from paper patient records to electronic health records. Leadership changes at SLU's Madrid Campus and the direct inclusion of Madrid's senior administrators in regular meetings of important governance and curriculum entities began to create a new synergy between the St. Louis and M adrid campuses. The Student Success Center opened, combining key functions including career services, academic support services, and disability services into a \"one-stop-shop\" for academic and personal success. The Mission Statement of the University was r evised primarily to codify SLU's longstanding commitment to health care as a primary University responsibility, as well as teaching, research, and service. The new undergraduate marketing campaign, Be a Billiken , was launched. 2009 An Emergency Scholarshi p Fund, administered by the Office of Student Financial Services, was created in 2009 to help returning students whose continuation at SLU was in jeopardy due to financial difficulty; this assistance is made in addition to regular financial aid awards. Fu rther, SLU increased the value of its financial award to full -time undergraduate siblings to $3000 from $1000. New undergraduate programs in civil engineering, environmental studies, and health management were added in response to nationally emerging needs . 2010 SLU opened Casa de Salud, a clinic designed to deliver high quality basic health and wellness services to uninsured and underinsured patients, primarily Latinos. The $300M goal of SLU's Campaign for Saint Louis University: Where Knowledge Touches Lives was achieved. The University's academic administrative structure was reorganized under three campus vice presidents (i.e., Frost, Health Sciences, and Madrid). 27 Chapter II: University Overview The Graduate School was dissolved as an administrative unit, and graduate education was significantly decentralized ; some centralized functions remain in the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs under a new associate vice president for graduate education . SLU received a $5 million grant from the Alberici Foundation to establish t he new Center for Sustainability, a first for the nation's 28 Jesuit colleges and universities. 2011 The University's renovation of a 100 -year-old building near campus into Hotel Ignacio makes Midtown St. Louis more conveniently accessible to out -of-town guests. The city of St. Louis named this project a Development of the Year and it was also recognized by the St. Louis Landmarks Association. The Health Sciences Education Union and Medical Center Recreation Complex were completed. The Un iversity's academic administrative structure was refined to reflect a chief academic officer model through a vice president for academic affairs. The new Center for Global Citizenship in renovated Des Peres Hall opened to bring together under one roof the University's academic and support units having international foci. 2012 It was announced that the School of Law will move downtown in 2013, giving SLU's students improved access to the courts and the area's most highly -regarded law firms, as well as contr ibuting to the housing and retail development of the area. SLU announced plans to build a state -of-the-art ambulatory care center to replace the aging Doctor's Office Building on the recently acquired site of the vacant Pevely Dairy complex. Coached by Ri ck Majerus, the SLU Billikens men's basketball team was selected to make its first NCAA tournament appearance since 2000. Unive rsity Responses to HLC Recommen dations/Requirements from the 2002 Self -Study In the comprehensive report of the HLC site visit team that visited Saint Louis University (SLU) in April 2002, team members began their rationale for recommending continued, 10 -year accreditat ion by noting that Saint Louis University has made remarkable progress in the last decade under dynamic, stable leadership. This is a transformed campus that could easily be the envy of any urban university seeking to create a distinctive identity. The c ampus community has embraced the mission. This mission is both understood and made known by all elements of the campus community. Moreover, this shared mission provides the primary link among students, faculty, and administrators across an impressive array of colleges, schools, and programs that collectively offer scores of strong undergraduate and graduate opportunities. Equally impressive, the mission of the University as it is being implemented connects the University with the Greater St. Louis community in ways that inspire enthusiasm and respect. A strong faculty and a commitment to academic quality support the University's vision for new stature as it evolves into a research university. Its mission and academic distinctiveness distinguishes Saint Louis University from other academic institutions in the St. Louis area. In 2012, the SLU community believes such praise is again warranted, as this Self -Study has helped multiple constituencies recognize how SLU has advanced its collective ability to more eff ectively live its mission since 2002. But in the spirit of the Magis , the SLU community also recognizes that we can more deeply and broadly understand our mission, and more effectively live it with even greater impact. The site visit team in 2002 28 Chapter II: University Overview echoed that spirit, as well, noting in their report that the success cited above carries with it new challenges and opportunities. Chief among those opportunities identified by the team in 2002 was the need to strengthen, University - wide, the assessment of student learning. Indeed, the team reported that, across all of five of the then -current HLC Criteria, a pattern of evidence [was] sufficiently demonstrated \u2014with only one qualifying concern, that being in the area of assessment. More specifically, the team noted that while implementation of assessment is generally consistent at the unit level...not all of the elements for a comprehensive and University -wide plan are in place. Of particular interest to the site visit team was assessment of the Universit y's core curricula, which the team described as not developed. Accordingly, HLC required that SLU strengthen its assessment efforts and detail results of those efforts in a Progress Report on Assessment to the HLC in summer 2005. SLU quickly began to respond. The University assigned the Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs the tasks of coordinating all institutional assessment activities an d creating a University -wide assessment committee. The committee was charged with: 1. sharing best practices and resources for outcomes and assessment methods; 2. promoting outcomes and assessment activities across the University; 3. identifying assessment expert s among faculty and staff to work with departments and programs; 4. assessing faculty and department developmental needs in outcomes assessment and making recommendations for activities and delivery to meet needs; and 5. serving as an advisory group to the Offic e of Institutional Research in the design of institutional -level assessment. These actions were consistent with best practices ( Walvoord, 2010 ) and signaled SLU's commitment not only to meeting HLC's requirements but to moving the institution forward toward a culture of evidence -based decision making. SLU then began to refine its University -level learning outcomes. At the time of the site visit, SL U had adopted 23 separate outcomes for undergraduates of the University. The site visit team helped SLU faculty and academic administrators understand that those outcomes were not a viable framework for assessment. In fall 2002, the University initiated a collegial process to distill the essential elements of the 23 original outcomes. This process resulted in a new framework for student learning outcomes and assessment titled The Five Dimensions of the Saint Louis University Experience . The Dimensions are: scholarship and knowledge intellectual inquiry and communication community building leadership and service spirituality and values The Five Dimensions were designed to avoid the flaws of the previous 23 outcomes, and to be the centerpiece of a comp rehensive outcomes and assessment effort that operationalize d SLU's mission at multiple levels. At the program level, meetings were held throughout the fall of 2002 involving deans, assessment coordinators, and department chairs to establish a process v ia which to align articulated learning outcomes for each program with The Five Dimensions, and to provide information on how these outcomes were assessed. All departments \u2014at the undergraduate, graduate, and professional levels \u2014articulated outcomes and rel ated assessment activities for each of their programs of study. An iterative process of drafting and revising core course outcomes in the context of The Five Dimensions continued throughout fall 2003. As reported in SLU's Progress Report in 2005, this pr ocess proved to be an important step in aligning core courses with program outcomes and in creating a feedback loop necessary to 29 Chapter II: University Overview carry out an effective system of outcomes assessment. Both outcomes and assessment plans were evaluated by the Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs to ensure that they advanced the University's goal to develop a culture of evidence -based decision making. Evaluation criteria were as follows: do the outcomes address The Five Dimensions ? are the outcomes manageable? are the outcomes meaningful? are the outcomes measurable? are assessment activities appropriate for the specified outcomes? do assessment activities measure the specified outcomes? do assessment activities occur regularly? are assessment activities summative f or the program? do assessment activities provide information for program improvement? At the college/school/center level, units have been asked to address the alignment of their expected learning outcomes and assessment processes with The Five Dimensions on annual reports to the Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA). Those reports specifically asked deans and directors to describe the programmatic or curricular changes made or planned based on student outcomes assessment results and provide a brief rationale for the changes and categorize each change under the appropriate dimension of The Five Dimensions of the SLU Experience . This request reinforced annually the need to contextualize learning outcomes throughout all SLU colleges/schools/centers within the framework of the University -wide Five Dimensions . At the institutional level, the development of The Five Dimensions necessarily led to the development of a number of assessments that have established the pervasive impact of The Five Dimensi ons throughout SLU. Surveys of and focus groups with students, conducted in multiple years throughout the past decade, attest to the value that both students and faculty have placed on the Dimensions and the individual learning outcomes established with t he Dimensions in mind. So successful was the collaborative process used to develop The Five Dimensions that it was the subject of a paper presented at the 2005 annual meeting of the North Central Association. The Five Dimensions in 2012 and Beyond As discussed elsewhere in this Self -Study Report, particularly in Chapter V (where we address HLC's Criterion Three), The Five Dimensions as currently articulated and employed are not without their limitations, both in terms of the development of well -aligne d student learning outcomes and related assessment activities. As the national assessment environment has matured \u2014and as HLC's current criteria for accreditation clearly reflect \u2014the need for a more mature assessment framework and associated goals for lear ning also is evident. While The Five Dimensions met both the institution's and HLC's needs for a time, it is clear that they need to be rearticulated and made more explicit, better enabling the development and revision of appropriate student learning outc omes and assessment activities across the institution for both graduate and undergraduate students. For some academic leaders and faculty, that realization has been in the making for several years; for others, their involvement in this Self-Study illumi nated the contemporary limitations of the Dimensions that are now in the early stages of being addressed. With changes in senior academic leadership came changes in academic planning and reporting processes. Throughout the 2011 -12 year, the VPAA has been working with deans and directors on the development of new academic plans as part of new, institution -wide strategic planning efforts. Discussion of SLU's multiple core curricula, the desire for a common, University -wide core educational experience, and strong support of new assessment and evaluation protocols all will impact discussions of the future of The Five Dimensions as the institution -wide framework for educational goal -setting and assessment. 30 Chapter II: University Overview Toward that end, in summer 2011, the VPAA made a significant commitment of key educational leaders' time and funding to the institution's involvement with the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U). Echoing a call by the President, the VPAA's expressed goal is to bring to bear the A AC&U's research, networking, and assessment resources on a University -wide effort to develop, articulate, and implement throughout all undergraduate programs a core educational experience grounded in and reflective of a shared understanding of SLU's distin ctive Jesuit educational character. The Five Dimensions \u2014as articulated in the 2005 Progress Report on Assessment to the HLC \u2014likely will need to be re -conceived and applied in new ways to direct the development and assessment of such an experience. Chapter II I Criterion One: Mission and Integrity The organization operates with integrity to ensure the fulfillment of its mission through structures and processes that involve the board, administration, faculty, staff, and students. 32 Chapter III: Criterion One Chapter III: Criterion One Core Component 1a The organization's mission documents are clear and articulate publicly the organization's commitments. The Mission Statement of the University, implemented after institution -wide consultation in 1991 , has been the cornerstone of SLU's existence ever since. The Mission Statement articulates and focuses the primary responsibilities of the University, and links its core values to the Jesuit educational tradition. The statement was revised in 2008 under the direction of the Vice President for Mission and Ministry, primarily to codify SLU's longstanding commitment to health care as a primary University responsibility, as well as teaching, research, and service. The University had dedicated substantial fi nancial and human resources to health care throughout its history, yet this had not been reflected in the Mission Statement . The modified Mission Statement was approved by the Board of Trustees in September 2008. The Mission Statement explicitly identifies SLU as a Catholic, Jesuit university, with pursuit of truth for the greater Glory of God and for the service of humanity as the mission. A clarification offered at the end of the statement is that this pursuit... is guided by the spiritual and intellectual ideals of the Society of Jesus (the Jesuit Order). The University thereby defines its pursuit of truth not as an abstract end itself, but as a means within a set of spiritual and intellectual ideals or iented for the greater Glory of God and for the service of humanity. This construction regarding the pursuit of knowledge is itself an allusion to a Jesuit document, the First Principle and Foundation found in the Spiritual Exercises written by Saint Ig natius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuits. This makes clear that the mission of Saint Louis University is also influenced by external documents that publicly articulate the commitments of a Catholic and Jesuit institution of higher learning. Article I of the University's Bylaws reiterate SLU's corporate purposes as expressed in its articles of incorporation: the encouragement of learning, and the extension of the means of education. The Bylaws also explicitly cite the four purposes and essential pri nciples of the University: (1) that it will be publicly identified as a Catholic university and as a Jesuit university, (2) that it will be motivated by the moral, spiritual, and religious values of the Judeo -Christian tradition, (3) that it will be g uided by the spiritual and intellectual ideals of the Society of Jesus, and (4) that through the fulfillment of its corporate purposes, by teaching, research, and community service, [SLU] is, and will be, dedicated to the education of men and women, to t he Greater Glory of God, and to the temporal and eternal well -being of all men and women. While the full Mission Statement itself is widely available (on the web, the Faculty Manual , Staff Handbook , etc.), several SLU mission -related pamphlets are made a vailable to faculty including In Perspective , and The Jesuit Mission of Saint Louis University , which was updated following the 2008 revision of the Mission Statement . These pamphlets help to inform, publicize, and interpret the mission to a variety of au diences, in a variety of contexts, ensuring familiarity with, and understanding of, the institution's commitments. SLU's Mission Statement truly is a University -wide statement, providing focus and governing all activities at all locations. It is shared a s well by SLU's Madrid campus, where the University's mission pamphlet is translated into Spanish. In his release of the pamphlet throughout the Madrid campus, the campus vice pres ident noted, I hope what you find here is not new to you, but an expression of what you know and live each day. ...But I also know that it is good for all of us, periodically, to step back and revisit the written expressions themselves, and to reflect on h ow we are living them in our relationship with others and in the decisions we make. 33 Chapter III: Criterion One Communicating the Mission and Mission -Related Commitments Current and Prospective Faculty and Staff To aid prospective faculty in their understanding of the Jesuit mis sion and Catholic identity of the University, a key document called In Perspective was developed and has been available in both printed and digital formats . In addition to providing a ba sic introduction to the humanistic values of Jesuit education, In Perspective addresses the role of academic freedom at a Catholic university \u2014a topic of great importance to faculty and one about which many individuals may be unclear. In Perspective has be en distributed to faculty and staff at both the St. Louis and Madrid campuses. Faculty candidates who read In Perspective prior to their interviews or even after having accepted a position at the University reported that this document was helpful to them in understanding the University mission, values, Catholic identity and the interplay with academic freedom. No formal assessment of In Perspective has taken place; however, in 2011 the Vice President for Mission and Ministry developed a new document, The Catholic and Jesuit Identity of Saint Louis University, which soon will be available University -wide and replace In Perspective. For many years, the mission component in the University's new employee orientation program consisted of veteran and new staff discussing the mission and then viewing a video titled Shared Vision , which amplified and clarified the mission for new employees. Although the message in the video is timeless, the video as a whole needs to be updated to reflect the contemporary work for ce, and is not currently used in its entirety. Also in 2011, the Division of Human Resources decided to separate the mission orientation component from the new employee orientation program to give our new staff the opportunity to participate more fully in learning about the mission and how they can apply it to their work and lives. Human Resources has now implemented a two -part, biannual mission orientation for new staff. Each of the two sequenced sessions is facilitated by faculty and staff, and addre sses the history of St. Ignatius, Ignatian spirituality, and the Jesuit mission of Saint Louis University. Several of the presenters address specifically how they have incorporated the mission into their work at the University. Although participation in mission programs is encouraged throughout the University, these new mission orientations are already required for all staff reporting to the Vice President for Human Resources and the Vice President for Mission and Ministry. The standard new employee o rientation \u2014required of all new employees at the University \u2014still retains a brief fifteen minute overview of the mission of the University, with information distributed about upcoming programs through the Division of Mission and Ministry, and training oppor tunities in human resources devoted to the mission (currently, most such training is targeted to managers). Additionally, the Divisions of Human Resources and Mission and Ministry collaborated to develop Our Way of Proceeding , a resource tailored for man agers that communicates fundamental and historical Jesuit principles presented in a contemporary University context. Current and Prospective Students Mission -related topics have been incorporated into SLU's Be A Billi ken campaign, begun in 2008 b y the Division of Enrollment and Retention Management to communicate the University's mission to prospective students and their parents. The Billiken has been SLU's distinctive masco t for a century, thus serving as a natural vehicle through which the University's mission is conveyed. This campaign, which widely features current students, introduces the Jesuit intellectual tradition and its guiding values through blogs, online quizzes , and a series of videos (e.g., What is a Jesuit Education? and Be Spiritual. Be a Billiken ). In addition to the online marketing, Be A Billiken is also used as a theme to convey the mission of the University in radio spots, outdoor billboards, and video trailers in movie theaters. The Be A Billiken website has experienced considerable traffic . FY2009 saw 21,000 visitors and in FY2010 there were 47,000 \u2014an increase of 124%. Applications from domestic freshmen have increased since the start of the Be A Billiken campaign and, while we have no hard evidence that the campaign is directly 34 Chapter III: Criterion One responsi ble for the increase in applications, prospective students do mention it favorably. Striving to build on this success, two additional videos were added; one features opportunities for community service at SLU and the other highlights our Welcome Week prog ram for new students. The Be A Billiken campaign also has been launched in Madrid, introducing the concept of the University's mascot \u2014and its significance \u2014to prospective international students. Prospective students also are introduced to the University 's mission and educational values through the Viewbook , a printed resource. The University publishes an annual Profile containing important data and statistics about enrollment, academic units, a nd research. The Mission Statement and a description of the Jesuit education tradition both are included in this University snapshot. The Profile is available in printed and online . Overall, Un iversity mission documents are clear and articulate publicly SLU's commitments and focus. Additionally, individual programs designed to orient students, faculty, and staff to the mission are periodically evaluated. However, the University has not engaged in any comprehensive evaluation of the collective impact of mission -related documents ( In Perspective , The Jesuit Mission of Saint Louis University, etc.), programs , or activities for the purpose of meeting University -wide mission -related goals such as mi ssion understanding, mission effectiveness, or hiring for mission. Nor has the University identified specific goals for which the mission -related documents, programs, and seminars would be used. Accordingly, we recognize the need to engage in assessment a ctivities that demonstrate how mission -related documents, programs, and seminars are contributing to a deeper understanding of the University's purposes and essential principles. Core Component 1b In its mission documents, the organization recogni zes the diversity of its learners, other constituencies, and the greater society it serves. At the heart of the University's Mission Statement is the value that education is enriched by a diverse group of learners. The hope and aim of gathering students , faculty, and staff from various backgrounds is to create community, one that fosters each individual's gifts and development, and then calls forth those gifts for the service of humanity and the greater glory of God. Among external documents that serve as a foundation for and explain SLU's Catholic and Jesuit identity are the Documents of the General Congregations (GC) of the Jesuit Order (General Congregations are gatherings of international representatives of the Jesuit order; only 35 such meetings h ave been held in the 500+ year history of the order) . According to Decree 15 of the GC 34, As disciples of the risen Lord, we believe that his paschal mystery radiates throughout the whole of human history, touching every religion, every culture, and ev ery person, including those who do not know him and those who, in conscience, cannot bring themselves to have faith in him. The document further explains in Section 18 that The work of God in the diversity of human history is seen in the long process of enlightened human growth -still incomplete! - as expressed in religious, social, moral, and cultural forms that bear the mark of the silent work of the Spirit. In Section 23, the document states that A genuine attempt to work from a shared experience of C hristians and unbelievers in a secular and critical culture, built upon respect and friendship, is the only successful starting point. Our ministry towards atheists and agnostics will either be a meeting of equal partners in dialogue, addressing common qu estions, or it will be hollow. This dialogue will be based upon a sharing of life, a shared commitment to action for human development and liberation, a sharing of values and a sharing of human experience. This formulation posits that God's work can be found in a vast diversity of religions, cultures, and peoples (including those who do not believe in God). Consequently, our educational mission must and does begin with mutual respect of and friendship for a diversity of equal partners addressing common questions with a commitment to action for human development. 35 Chapter III: Criterion One In the September 13, 2011, issue of a recurring feature called Mission Matters in Newslink , the University's daily e -newsletter, SLU's Vice President for Mission and Ministry addressed diver sity in the context of Jesuit spirituality in this way: [St. Ignatius'] concept of God as present in all parts of our world opens us to perceive diversity in a more positive, a more active, perspective. The differences we face are not threats, but invita tions to understand more deeply ourselves, the world and the immensity of God. Diversity becomes a gift that enhances our limited experiences, calling and enabling us to move beyond those mental walls into a better and more expansive experience and knowle dge of truth. The bothersome differences of people and cultures become the means for us to move beyond the edges of our boxes so we might have a real possibility of thinking - outside -the-box. Ignatius called us to seek and see God in all things, all peop le, all situations, in -and out of -the box. At SLU, we can not only celebrate diversity as inevitable, but also, and more, as a blessing, a gift given to us to understand and live our mission. The truth lies outside our own experiences and perspectives, an d so we need and depend on learning from others' viewpoints to advance our own and others' understanding. Creating a diverse and inclusive environment is, thus, a key component of the mission of the University, which is further enhanced by the University Diversity and Inclusion Vision Statement . The Vision Statement , written to serve as a companion piece to the Mission Statement , was developed by the President's Diversity Council (PDC) and adopted by the Presi dent's Coordinating Council (PCC) in February 2011. Designed to affirm the University's commitment to providing an inclusive environment for students, faculty, and staff and to help guide University -wide diversity and inclusion initiatives, the Vision Sta tement asserts that the University is committed to fostering an inclusive environment that welcomes and celebrates all expressions of diversity and identity that advance the Jesuit mission of forming women and men for and with others. The principles esp oused in SLU's Mission Statement , further explicated in GC 34, and the Diversity and Inclusion Vision Statement , are supported by the Affirmative Action Statement in the University Bylaws (Article IV), the Harassm ent Policy , the Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action Policy , and the Hate Crime and Bias -Related Incident Response Protocol . Central to each of these i nstitution -wide policies/protocols is the principle that all members of the University community are entitled to an environment that respects their fundamental human dignity, and the dignity of all human beings. In developing the Diversity and Inclusion V ision Statement , the PDC recognized the importance of providing the University community with transparent communication regarding all University efforts related to diversity and inclusion and developing ways to hold the institution accountable to its Visio n. Accordingly, in spring 2011 the University launched a website for diversity which presents an overview of the steps that the University is taking to increase diversity, including initiatives from the students , policies on diversity, statistics about the University's demographic diversity, and available resources for all members of the community. The website is easily accessible via the Diversity at SLU link on the University's home page . Details about the nature and scope of racial/ethnic diversity of SLU's faculty, staff and students is published annually in the SLU Fact Book . Students have also evidenced exemplary leadership in advancing the understanding and appreciation of diversity throughout campus. A prime example is the development of the Oath of Inclusion , a student - initiated creed developed in the 2010 -2011 school year in r esponse to several bias incidents on the St. Louis campus in previous years. The Oath \u2014provided in multiple languages \u2014is a document that sets up the 36 Chapter III: Criterion One expectation for all students, once admitted to Saint Louis University, to promote inclusion on our campus and use resources offered by SLU to aid them in that process. Student Oath of Inclusion We as students form a diverse and vibrant university community. We do not enter into this community by proximity, but by virtue of a shared Jesuit vision - to pursue higher truths, obtain greater knowledge, and strive for a better world. In this endeavor, we do not succeed by our individual ambitions, but by our discovery of each other. We find higher truths when we seek to understand the complexity of our neighb ors' identities, we obtain greater knowledge when we consider the perspectives of our fellow students, and we begin to strive for a better world when we build a stronger community. As a student and a member of the SLU community, I will live by this oath. I will embrace people for the diversity of their identities, creating a community inclusive of race, ethnicity, sex, age, ability, faith, orientation, gender, class, and ideology. I will challenge my worldview through education inside and outside the cla ssroom. I will show that I am proud to be a Billiken by enriching the culture of our University. I will foster a community that welcomes all by recognizing the inherent dignity of each person. I will work for social justice in the Saint Louis community and beyond. This is the SLU I believe in. This is the community I am building. This is our SLU. Additionally, the constitutions of all Chartered Student Organizations (CSOs) must outline the CSO's mission and purpose \u2014and, in doing so, include a Jesui t clause that defines specifically how the CSO both aligns with and advances the SLU mission. It is important to note that SLU is also attentive to the cultural distinctions inherent in its operations at the Madrid campus, which attracts a truly intern ational student body. For example, the kind of affinity for the Jesuit identity so strong in St. Louis does not manifest itself with the same intensity in Spain. Feedback from faculty and staff at the Madrid campus evidences that the Catholic, Jesuit mis sion is not the driver it is in the United States. Rather, that SLU Madrid is an American university is the more powerful draw. Institutionally, SLU is discussing the implications of that divide, and what it means for how and why it communicates with d iverse audiences about its mission and values. This point will be particularly important as SLU looks to extend programming and, perhaps, its international physical presence, beyond current locations. \"If you are not satisfied with what SLU is giving you in terms of education, service, and opportunities, it is your job as a student to make your voice heard, either by yourself, or through GSA. If you work with the institution to make these four years the best possible , you have appropriate student involvement.\" \u2014 Student Activity Leader 37 Chapter III: Criterion One Core Component 1c Understanding of and sup port for the mission pervade the organization People From its very first sentence, SLU's Mission Statement grounds the institution in the Ignatian perspective that both deeds, and the intentionality of those deeds, matter. While the mission, in whole or part, is routinely invoked by students, faculty, and staff alike, it is also manifested in their actions throughout varied institutional contexts. Students Undergraduate students are introduced to the University's mission from the moment they first inq uire about enrolling. Through the Viewbook and Be A Billiken campaign, prospective students are informed about the University's mission. In spring 2011, a committee of administrators and staff reviewed the prompts for admission essays to be written by stu dents. The overwhelming consensus was to include a question on the University's mission which would invite the applicants to consider how their values would contribute to the mission. The current admission essay questions now ask prospective students: Based on SLU's Jesuit mission, how do you see yourself living it out throughout your college experience or beyond? Interviews for Presidential Scholarships -conducted by faculty, staff and students -frequently center on ways in which prospective awardees e xpect to demonstrably contribute to the advancement of mission through their studies and their service at SLU. During the summer SLU 101 orientations for first year and transfer students, currently enrolled students reflect on how they have been influen ced by the University's mission and consequently try to live out the mandate to transform the world. Students who are studying at the Madrid campus are invited to reflect on how their study abroad experience might stretch them and assist them in addressin g the social justice challenges which the contemporary world presents. The earliest curricular vehicle through which undergraduates are introduced to the University's mission is University 101 , the freshmen success course first offered on the St. Louis ca mpus in 2002, and subsequently offered on the Madrid campus since 2006. The portion of the course that deals specifically with SLU's mission has been part of the curriculum since the course's inception. The desired learning outcome for the Jesuit missio n segment is the ability of students to identify key aspects of the Jesuit mission. Assessment results from 2006 -2009 show that, on average, 81% of students in the course either agreed or strongly agreed that Participation in University 101 helped me id entify key aspects of the Jesuit Mission. Understanding of and support for the University's mission is a fundamental goal of a foundational course across the University: THEO -100: T heological Foundations . Although not officially an institution -wide undergraduate requirement (SLU's core curricula will be addressed primarily in the chapters on Criteria Three and Four), THEO -100 is a de facto element of the curricular requirements of all SLU colleges and schools; in short, nearly every undergraduate on t he St. Louis and Madrid campuses takes this course, which is taught from a shared syllabus by the faculty of the Department of Theological Studies. Every student in this course is introduced to the University's Mission Statement (included on every sectio n's syllabus) and asked to reflect on how their own values do/do not resonate with it. Each semester, students from multiple sections intentionally scheduled to meet simultaneously gather for a joint presentation on Jesuit mission conducted by one of the Jesuit faculty members in the Department of Theological Studies or another faculty member who is well versed in the values of Jesuit education. The Manresa Program , SLU's Catholic Studies program, is another i mportant, mission -focused academic program. The Manresa Program provides students with a systematic way of studying the rich intellectual and social justice tradition that shapes SLU's Catholic and Jesuit identity. The impact of this program extends well beyond those students pursuing the certificate in that it also focuses attention on the Catholic, Jesuit 38 Chapter III: Criterion One foundations through co -curricular activities such as field trips to art museums, churches, social outings, and a film series. The wide appeal of the Manresa Program is partly reflected in the majors of students who have graduated with this certificate in the past decade: art history, biology, communication, criminal justice, economics, English, history, management information systems, occupational the rapy, philosophy, physical therapy, psychology, Spanish, and theology. Many of these students have gone on to graduate school, medical school, and law school; others have pursued positions in ministry, teaching, and business in both the profit and non -profit sectors. The holistic development of students is a fundamental value of Jesuit education, evidenced at Saint Louis University by a commitment to providing resources to help students develop in mind, body, and spirit. The Division of Student Developme nt provides students with services to encourage their social, moral, emotional, and physical development through student activities, a conduct process that is focused on learning from one's mistakes, counseling, and a robust recreation facility. Working c ollaboratively with staff from the Division of Student Development, the Department of Campus Ministry provides programs to help undergraduate and graduate students actively develop their spiritual lives. Activities ranging from mass, prayer services, smal l faith sharing groups, retreats, immersion trips, vigils, and advocacy training provide students with the integration of faith and justice. On Sundays, the Department of Campus Ministry sponsors both the 4:30 pm and 9:00 p.m. masses at St. Francis Xavier College Church on campus; together, those services are attended by more than 1000 students on average. The students are actively involved in the liturgical life of the University as choir members, lectors, servers, greeters, and extraordinary ministers o f the Eucharist. More than 200 students volunteer and are trained by Campus Ministry staff members to serve in these ministries. Christian Life Communities, commonly known as CLCs, are one means by which Campus Ministry introduces students to Ignatian spirituality. CLCs are a modern version of the historic sodalities of the Society of Jesus, small groups of students who meet for prayer and service. In their structure at SLU, each small group is led by a guide who has previously participated in CLC a nd who receives training in group facilitation. The groups meet weekly to reflect on their lives, to support one another in Christian living, and for shared prayer. The three pillars of CLCs are community, spirituality, and mission. In the course of a ye ar, each group reflects on each of these pillars. In 2010 -2011 there were 21 CLCs with 120 students participating, including graduate students. Students continuing to live and extend SLU's mission after graduation are the subject of a new Magis Informati onal Series, offered by the Department of Campus ministry in the 2011 -2012 academic year. Through the series, current students and recent alumni learn about post -graduation service opportunities offered via various sources, such as the St. Joseph Worker P rogram, Jesuit Volunteer Corps, Teach for America, and L'Arche Community. Recognizing the value of time away for quiet and reflection, Campus Ministry offers a variety of retreats designed to help students to grow and deepen their relationship with God. The Nature Retreat in the fall semester invites students to reflect on the presence of God in the created world. As a part of this retreat, students are given a three hour block of time to walk in the woods a lone. Students have shared that this is the first time in their lives that they felt completely alone with God, and are very moved by this opportunity. In Madrid, Campus Ministry organizes retreats each term to Loyola, the birthplace of St. Ignatius, t o develop an awareness and inspiration from the life and works from the founder of the Jesuits. Student evaluations of these retreats affirm them as life -changing, helping the University affirm its decision to locate a campus in Spain. Having approp riate space on campus for such reflection is also vitally important. Accordingly, to complement the many campus locales rooted in the University's Christian and Catholic religious heritage, in 39 Chapter III: Criterion One 2011-2012 SLU dedicated a significant amount of prime square footage in the centrally -located Des Peres building for a new Interfaith Sacred Space. The space is designed to foster spiritual growth in all students, and serve as a place for interfaith dialogue, as well. Indeed, the University recognizes the religio us diversity of the student body (see Figure 1 below). The Department of Campus Ministry works with ministers from many faith traditions to assist students in finding their faith homes. These ministers, known as affiliate ministers, have official reco gnition through the Campus Ministry. The affiliate ministers provide bible studies, retreats, service sites, immersion trips, and worship services in order to meet the diverse faith needs of SLU students. Several student organizations also provide studen ts from particular faiths the means to live out their beliefs and values. These include the Hindu Students' Community, Muslim Student Association, and Jew ish Student Association . The Interfaith Alliance is a student organization that is dedicated to enga ging students from different religious backgrounds in service and dialogue.

The Safe Zone program, via which stude nts, faculty and staff are trained as allies of LGBTQ students, and the growing Intergroup Dialogue Program are just two examples of the diversity of the Center's offerings. The Intergroup Dialogue Program, launched in fall 2009, provides structured, su stained, and facilitated face - to-face class meetings for people from different and often conflicted social -identity groups. These meetings are designed to offer an open and inclusive space in which participants can foster a deeper understanding of diversi ty and social justice issues through experiential activities, pedagogical interventions, and individual and small group reflections. 40 Chapter III: Criterion One Faculty and Staff Prospective employees learn about the University's mission and Catholic identity when they apply for a position . The following hiring for mission statement was added to the home page of the online application tool in the spring of 2011 after discussion by the Executive Staff Committee: Saint Louis University is a Catholic, Jesuit University ranked among the top higher education institutions in the nation. Our mission \u2014to pursue truth for the greater glory of God and the service of humanity \u2014inspires our eff orts to transform our society and our world through teaching, research, health care and service to the community. Seeking faculty and staff of all faiths who share a passion for our mission, we expect University personnel to continue our nearly 200 -year he ritage of excellence, leadership and innovation by committing themselves to a deepening understanding of the traditions, values and aspirations of contemporary Jesuit higher education. The purpose of the statement is to communicate to applicants the Unive rsity's desire to employ a diverse work force committed to furthering the University's mission. Human Resources has prepared interview questions that serve as best practices when departments are interviewing applicants on both the St. Louis and Madrid c ampuses. One topic of these best practice interview questions asks the applicant to articulate how they will contribute to the University's mission. As mentioned previously , new St. Louis campus staff employees have been required by the Vice Presidents for Human Resources and Mission and Ministry to participate in a separate orientation to the University's mission. These mission orientations are offered in the fall and spring semesters and are led by four to five presenters. Topics include the history of Ignatius, Ignatian Spirituality, and the Jesuit heritage of SLU. Two of the presenters are staff members who share how they have incorporated the mission into their work at the University. The format is designed to provide new staff with an in -depth o pportunity to learn about the University's mission and to help them apply it in their work. Distinguishing the mission element in the orientation provides new staff the opportunity to share and reflect on their own experiences and to understand how they ar e a part of a shared mission. Intergroup dialogues provide safe spaces for individuals to discuss difficult, controversial, and even taboo topics that many people think about daily but don't have a structure from which t o discuss in depth. Participants reflect on relevant issues, work with differences and conflicts, and identify socially just actions they can take individually and in alliance with others. 41 Chapter III: Criterion One In 2011 the Reinert Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE) began a new effort and presented a brief overview of Ignatian pedagogy at two New Faculty Orientation sessions focused on the University's mission and faculty's pro fessional formation. These 1.5 hour sessions were held in multiple locations on the St. Louis campus. Year -round work of the CTE is heavily influenced by Ignati an pedagogy. The Division of Mission and Ministry promotes the Catholic and Jesuit identity of the University and welcomes the contributions of students, faculty and staff of different faith backgrounds. Philosophically, the Department of Campus Ministry lives the following statement from the Pontifical Council for Inter - religious Dialogue: We re cognize that in the interrelated context of our contemporary lives, inter -religious cooperation is no longer an option but a necessity. One could say that to be religious today is to be inter -religious. Religion will prosper in this century only to the ext ent that we can maintain a sense of community among people of different religious beliefs who work together as a human family to achieve a world of peace. Accordingly, Campus Ministry supports campus student groups for multiple faiths (e.g., the Muslim Student Association and Interfaith Alliance ); and provides information to help non -Catholics worship and otherwise pursue their personal faith journeys (e.g., the St. Louis Hillel ). Working closely with students, faculty and staff, Campus Ministry also seeks to develop awareness and deepen their commitment to the University's distinctive Catho lic, Jesuit mission and identity. The Division of Mission and Ministry also provides spiritual formation opportunities that strengthen personal and communal growth, and Ignatian programs that form and inform the University community in its Jesuit tradition and Ignatian values. Although no systematic assessment of these programs nor their learning outcomes is in place, informally participants report that these programs are beneficial to understanding the Universi ty's mission and Jesuit educational tradition. Mission -related job interview questions: 1. Saint Louis University considers its Jesuit and Catholic identity as an essential component of its tradition, a component which distinguishes its educational endeavors and service pr ograms. How do you see yourself contributing to or being a part of this identity? 2. Saint Louis University describes itself as a Jesuit and Catholic institution. What role do you see for yourself in contributing to this identity? 3. Saint Louis University takes great pride in its Jesuit and Catholic identity. How do you see this applying to your work at the University, and how do you see yourself contributing to it? 42 Chapter III: Criterion One Trustees The work of SLU's Board of Trustees is regularly grounded in and tied to the institutional mission. More than any other University constituents, the Trustees are charged with ensuring fidelity to and sustainability of that mission. Perhaps the most critical way they do so is through their appointment of the president of the University. That appointment, and the ongoing evaluation of the president, is regularly informed by the Board's continually developing understanding of the mission and the institution's Jesuit heritage. For example, as the Board was deliberating a proposed change in institutional bylaws that would eliminate the requirement that SLU's president be a member of the Society of Jesus, the Board's Committee on Mission and Ministry prepared in 2006 a document titled Qualities Particularly Appropriate to the President of Saint Louis University as Leader of a Jesuit Institution . That document articulated the attributes desired in fu ture Saint Louis University presidents, specific to their ability to foster the Catholic, Jesuit mission of the institution. Only after the Board was satisfied that the character and mission of the institution could be both preserved and advanced under th e leadership of a non -Jesuit did it adopt the Bylaws change. Additionally, the Board's mission literacy is regularly enhanced via presentations by SLU's Vice President for Mission and Ministry and others. In 2008, Board members heard extended reflecti ons on the topic of Saint Louis University's Relationship with the Catholic Church and the Society of Jesus. Among the significant developments noted were the broadening of responsibility for the Catholic identity of the University from solely the Socie ty of Jesus to the University Board of Trustees, as well as a shift from the issue of control to that of fidelity to mission. And throughout 2009 -2010, the Board participated in a four -part series of mission -related presentations: September 2009: the history of Saint Louis University as rooted in the history of the Society of Jesus; December 2009: the key points of Ignatian spirituality that provide the foundational values and apostolic perspective of Saint Louis University; February 2010: develop ments in Jesuit higher education during the past 45 years; and September 2010: mission challenges particularly important to the Board as it moves the University into the future. Activities The University fulfills its mission through its corporate purpose s of teaching, research, service, and health care. While many other universities might have similar purposes, Saint Louis University strives to fulfill each of these purposes in ways that are in harmony with its Jesuit educational tradition and history. Teaching While faculty are experts in their particular academic disciplines, some faculty arrive at SLU with limited teaching experience. Even those who have had previous teaching experience may not have had any training in classroom management, sylla bus development, or instructional methods. The Reinert Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE) not only assists faculty and teaching assistants in developing teaching skills, but has a particular focus on helping faculty and graduate students find their own directions, meaning and pedagogical style in the context of Jesuit traditions of education. The CTE has sponsored an increasing number of programs related specifically to Ignatian pedagogy, or what some have called the Ignatian Pedagogy Paradigm. This p aradigm, derived from Ignatian spirituality and Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius, lays out a process , not a prescription, for teaching and learning. The five elements of Ignatian pedagogy -context, experience, reflection, action, and evaluation -provide a useful heuristic for shaping student learning experiences, at both the undergraduate and graduate level: Context: Who students are -their learning preferences, their cultural assumptions about learning -has a bearing on the teaching/learning situation. 43 Chapter III: Criterion One Experience: Students' previous life experiences, as well as what they already know about a subject, have a bearing on how they learn in a new context. Reflection: Only by reflecting on their previous and current experiences and learning can students internalize and deeply understand the material, as well as how to apply it. Action: Students only really understand concepts and theories when they can apply them, putting their learning into action (both in the classroom and beyond). Evaluation: Students' a ctions need to be evaluated so they can better determine how well they applied the learning and better reflect on how they might do things differently in another context; evaluation is eventually internalized, with self -evaluation the end result. These f ive elements of Ignatian pedagogy are deeply connected to one another in a dynamic process, not a static sequence. The CTE strives to introduce faculty to these elements and to sponsor interactive workshops in which faculty can learn ways to apply them mo re intentionally. Through CTE workshops, departmental consulting, and one -on-one consultations, faculty often realize they already do much of this, but they become more self -aware, more self -evaluative, and more strategic in their pedagogy. Full -time and adjunct faculty (including teaching assistants) are invited to participate in these activities, which are often co -sponsored by the Division of Mission and Ministry and the Center for Service and Community Engagement. Feedback from a spring 2011 full -day CTE workshop evidenced that while 100% of the participants rated the workshop as either excellent or good, the most appreciated aspect was an introduction to the Ignatian Spiritual Exercises and related practical techniques for pedagogy. Resear ch At SLU, research is a powerful manifestation of the search for truth at the heart of the institutional mission. Accordingly, faculty at SLU conduct a wide range of research, and they engage students at the graduate and undergraduate levels in their que st. Cognizant of the extensive literature documenting the relationship between student research and enhanced learning at the undergraduate level, the faculty strive to support undergraduate student research through the Honors Program, various major capsto ne courses, summer programs, etc. One limitation of such efforts is that the majority of student research opportunities are designed for the highest achieving students \u2014often those likely to go on to graduate or professional schools. University -wide recog nition of the ways in which all undergraduates could benefit from significant engagement with faculty in their research could open the door to curricular and pedagogical changes designed to impact the full spectrum of students. The McNair Scholars Program , part of the federal TRiO programs, is one example of a program that extends the impact of undergraduate research to a population of young scholars traditionally underrepresented in graduate schools. The faculty also recognize that their own teaching can be enhanced by maintaining a research agenda well - aligned with and supportive of the courses they teach, and are therefore attentive to ways in which they can manifest their research both directly and indirectly in their courses. Staff from the Center for Teaching Excellence, through one -on-one consultations and other faculty development workshops, stress the significance of tying faculty research to teaching, and involving students in that research whenever possible for their mutual benefit. The cre ation and advancement of knowledge itself is also an expression of the University mission to transform society in the spirit of the Gospels. In the context of living the institutional mission, what SLU faculty research is critically important. For exam ple, the SLU Center for World Health and Medicine is dedicated to the discovery and development of medicines to treat diseases that predominantly affect the world's poor and underserved patient populations. They directly support the University's mission to foster programs that link University resources to local, national and international communities in collaborative efforts to alleviate ignorance, poverty, injustice and hunger; extend compassionate care to the ill and needy; and maintain and improve the quality of life for all persons. 44 Chapter III: Criterion One Another example is the community research project, jointly conducted by faculty in SLU's departments of Psychology and Sociology & Criminal Justice, that compared health concern s and needs among Bosnian and Chinese immigrants with U.S. -born older adults in St. Louis. Funded by a grant from the SLU's President's Research Fund \u2014which is designed to seed, with institutional funds, mission -focused research that may, in turn, develop into externally -funded projects \u2014this project highlighted the struggles of immigrant communities for what native -born populations are often able to take for granted. In a nod of respect to those who participated in and were impacted by the study, presentat ions of research results were presented in English, Chinese, and Bosnian. Service Like research, service can be both a reflection of and means for enhancing quality teaching. Community service is one of the core purposes of SLU, and faculty, staff, a nd students actively participate in community organizations locally, nationally, and internationally. In 2009 -2010, faculty, staff, and students logged more than 1,001,500 hours of community service, earning SLU national recognition. The discussion abou t the relationship between volunteerism and service is active at SLU, often led by faculty and staff of the Center for Service and Community Engagement (CSCE), the Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE), the Division of Student Development, and the Divis ion of Mission and Ministry. All recognize that the engagement of students, faculty and staff in service should be aimed at ends supportive of advancing the institution's mission. There is less clarity about the relative value of various forms of service , in part because measuring the impact thereof is difficult, and because there are many who are and should be impacted by such service: the faculty/staff themselves, the students themselves, direct community beneficiaries, the St. Louis community as a whol e, and other professional and civic communities. There is, however, no shortage of service opportunities for everyone associated with SLU. The Community Partners Database of the CSCE evidence s the breadth of such opportunities. Mission or immersion trips that last from a week to several weeks are typical service activities for students, faculty, and staff alike. Trips are sponsored by faculty members from the School of Medicine, student organizations, the John Cook School of Business, and Campus Ministry. From medical brigades to building projects to advocacy for the needs of illegal immigrants, the disabled, and uneducated, students are immersed into the reality and suffering of margina lized peoples. Reflecting on these experiences, students repeatedly say that their experience helped them make connections among what they learn in the classroom, their understanding about social justice, and their faith. In many cases that reflection is a formal, directed activity (either by faculty, CSCE staff, or others) designed to deepen the learning experience for all involved. Employing this hallmark of Ignatian pedagogy, reflection leaders seek to enhance participants' understanding of and appr eciation for the institutional mission. The following sampling of student reflection responses to a Campus Ministry spring break mission trip serve to illustrate this point: [The trip] helped teach me that a lot of times, there aren't easy answers to solutions. A lot of the problems that face poverty stricken areas are systemic issues that go back generations, and just because you provide aid doesn't mean people will accept it. To me, social justice is about understanding an area and a culture to do mo re than just give a band -aid; [it's] about changing systems to help make a lasting change. My understanding of social justice will always evolve as I am exposed to more and more factors that affect our society and the way people live. I changed as a res ult of this trip because of the exposure I had to a population of people who others typically forget about when deciding who needs help in the world today. I also got a real life impression of the life of an illegal immigrant and a better understanding of why I should stand up for the rights of those people. 45 Chapter III: Criterion One The trip opened my eyes to give me a deeper understanding of social justice issues within the United States, especially the New Orleans area. I understand more about my duty as a Catholic to not perpe tuate oppressive systems and actions. Silence is a form of inaction and perpetuation of the systems of oppression. I was able to develop a better understanding of the lives of those affected by poverty issues: the welfare system, education, criminal justic e system, and housing. Mission trips are held throughout the year, and provide students with immersion experiences with people living on the margins of society. This helps students examine the social reality of poverty in our world, and its implications for Christian discipleship. Trips also frequently enable student to learning about immigration, racism, and the economic realities of globalization. Health Care A significant number of the University's colleges and schools are dedicated to training futu re healthcare providers. As we educate and train tomorrow's physicians, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and health care ethicists, the University also directly provides health care throughout the metropolitan St. Louis area. Living this aspect of the mission is a significant challenge. With changing federal laws, adjustments to Medicare and Medicaid, and health insurance companies driven to improve the bottom line, today's environment for providing health care is complex; health car e service options for those who are uninsured or underinsured are increasingly limited. But SLU has taken on this challenge as a matter of mission. The only recent revision to the University Mission Statement was to specifically add health care to the corporate mission of teaching, research and service. In some ways that change merely codified the true breadth of the mission; in other ways it provided appropriate emphasis to help direct future investments in, and plans for, the expansion of SLU's hea lth care programs. There is also a trend for medical students to choose residencies within a specialization, as specialization generally translates into a greater capacity for higher incomes. Accordingly, the Association of American Medical Colleges a nticipates that there will be a shortage of 21,000 primary care physicians by 2015 and that this shortage will double by 2020. Recognizing the detrimental impact of that trend \u2014in St. Louis and, particularly, in the less affluent communities SLU so directl y serves \u2014the School of Medicine has launched a new residency program. In developing this new program, SLU has chosen to partner with the Family Care Health Centers' Carondelet clinic, in south St. Louis, as the ambulatory site for the residency. Family C are is one of St Louis' federally qualified health centers. This clinic serves low income patients \u2014almost 40% of whom do not have health insurance. Through this residency, family practice residents deliver direct health care to a needy population, helpi ng SLU live its mission to serve by providing health care. Further, by evidencing the University's commitment to serving the disadvantaged, the faculty and staff of the School of Medicine aim to help students and residents appreciate and commit their prof essional lives to doing the same. SLU's Physician Assistant Program, housed in the Doisy College of Health Sciences, also trains medical professionals for work in high -need, family practice settings. A majority of program graduates \u201498 percent of whom pas s the national certification exam on the first administration \u2014 go on to work in primary care and family practice facilities. The study and practice of public health is a closely -related, mission -centered focus of the institution. SLU's School of Public H ealth is the only such school at a Jesuit university in the United States. The work of the School to create health equity and reduce health disparities is conducted around the faculty -defined pillars of collaboration, justice and practice. 46 Chapter III: Criterion One Core Component 1d The organization's governance and administrative structures promote effective leadership and support collaborative processes that enable the organization to fulfill its mission. The University is a complex organization comprised of both centralized and decentralized structures. Within the various areas of the University, administrative structures enable representation and active participation in governance by all populations of the University community. The organizations of the faculty, staff, and students, as well as the various colleges/schools/centers/libraries, the University Medical Group (UMG), and the Council of Academic Deans and Directors (CADD), all have governance structures. All existing administrative structures are intended to facilitate participation by the respective stakeholders and constituents, foster communication within the University community, and work to implement the overall mission of the University. Executive Governance At the highest levels of institutional de cision -making, SLU's administrative structure can be represented as follows: The Executive Staff Committee consists of the president, all University vice -presidents, as well as the assistant to the president and the dean/director of the Madrid Campus. Re-establishment of the position of Vice President for Mission and Ministry in 2005 has ensured that, in addition to the President's leadership for mission, the Executive Staff Committee regularly hears the voice of another senior executive charged with upholding and advancing the integrity and impact of the institutional mission. In his announcement regarding the creation of that position, the President noted that it addressed a need for an administrator at Board of Trustees President Executive Staff Committee Other Decision - and Policy - Making Bodies / People (CADD, FS, SAC, SGA / Individual Vice -Presidents) President's Coordinating Council (PCC) 47 Chapter III: Criterion One the executive level who can offer oversight an d marshal the resources needed to ensure that our mission remains in the forefront of everything we do. The President's Coordinating Council (PCC) consists of the membership of the Executive Staff Committee plus representatives from the following gover nance organizations: the Staff Advisory Committee (SAC), the Student Government Association (SGA), the Faculty Senate (FS), and a dean representing the Council of Academic Deans and Directors (CADD). Including representatives from these key leadership gro ups ensures a diversity of voices in truly institution -wide dialogues and deliberations. Representatives from SGA, SAC, and FS also sit on several committees of the University's Board of Trustees. It is generally understood throughout the institution tha t matters requiring the highest level of University - wide perspective and deliberation -particularly University -level policies and budgets \u2014are formally addressed by the PCC, which meets monthly. The Executive Staff Committee meets weekly, and feeds many of its recommendations to the PCC. Both groups clearly allow for constituent participation and facilitate decision - making. Shared Governance The importance of shared governance is widely held throughout the University community . The faculty, students, and staff have operational definition s of shared governance that are collaborative and consultative, but all constituents also understand that final operational decision -making authority rests with the president. Faculty participate in the governance of t he University at three levels: the University, the college/school/center/library, and finally, the various academic departments. At the University level, two structures allow for faculty governance: the Faculty Senate and University committees and task f orces. Documents, including constitution, bylaws, minutes, related to the governance and structure of the Faculty Senate are available on the Senate website . Through University committees, faculty addres s issues related to curriculum, instructional design, academic affairs, research, and rank and tenure. At the college/school/center/library level, a faculty assembly (or comparable body) is convened for the purpose of helping the members address significa nt issues, initiate proposals, and communicate their views to the Faculty Senate, administration of the college/school/center/library, or the administration of the University. At the department level, faculty members participate in meetings and committees that help to develop the goals of the respective department, courses, student advising, and research. The Faculty Manual outlines the general norms and responsibilitie s of the faculty with regard to teaching, research, student advising, governance, and service. The Faculty Senate is the governing body for the faculty and the means by which the faculty participate in the larger governance of the institution. Each college/school/center/library has its own procedures for faculty governance within the unit. The latest full revision of the Faculty Manual was approved by the Board of Trustees i n 2006; amendments were made in 2008. A Faculty Senate task force currently is engaged in addressing the need for additional amendments, including those related to the 2010 -2011 changes in the executive administrative leadership of the University. Shared governance is addressed in Article III. H.4. of the Faculty Manual . This provision articulates the complexity of governing the University and highlights the shared responsibility of Board of Trustees, the President, other members of the administration, f aculty members, students, and the University staff. This vision for shared governance acknowledges the importance of interdependent roles, communication, and joint planning. Primary roles of the faculty include: setting the academic requirements for the degrees offered by the University; determining the contents of University courses and the methods of instruction to be used; setting standards for admission of students to the University; recommending the specific individuals who will be granted earned degrees; and recommending faculty appointments, promotions, and tenure according to institutional norms 48 Chapter III: Criterion One In Spring 2007, 34% of SLU's faculty completed the Faculty Senate Governance Committee's Shared Governance Survey, which was developed to aid the Sen ate's understanding of the faculty perspective on shared Governance at SLU at all levels. Faculty Manual Section III.H. (i.e., Rights, Powers, Privileges, and Immunities of Faculty Members), was the basis for the survey instrument. Among the general findin gs of the Committee's Report on the Shared Governance Survey , available on the Senate's website, were that 90% of the respondents believe shared g overnance was important; 44% felt informed about the Senate's activities but less informed about the activities of the Vice President for Academic Affairs, President, and Board of Trustees; and 84% indicated familiarity with the faculty's authority and pow ers described in the Manual . At the c ollege/school/library levels, 78% characterized communication between administration and faculty as effective to some degree; 81% reported that academic freedom is very evident or evident; and 49% felt informed about their dean's activities. And at the department level, 70% felt informed about their chair's activities. Additional findings showed that evidence of faculty participation in the formal, ongoing evaluation of academic administrators was greater at the dep artment level than at the next higher level; the same was true of faculty input into budgets. Finally, while 56% felt informed about their respective faculty assemblies, only 28% felt their assembly was effective. To address the recommendations and speci fic topics that emerged from this survey, a Shared Governance Action Plan was developed with the organizing rubric of \"Communication \u2014Education \u2014Engagement\" and references to SLU's 2001 Strategic Plan. Its goals are (1) compliance with and enforcement of Faculty Manual provisions; and (2) transformation of SLU organizational culture. The survey and plan had the immediate impacts of increased participation of the academic deans in t he University budget process, the restructuring of Faculty Senate meetings to incorporate more opportunities for dialogue, Senate participation in chair and new faculty orientation programs, and greater outreach to college/school/library faculty assemblies . While the plan is understood to be a work in progress, renewed attention to its details at regular intervals would benefit all stakeholders by identifying successes, ongoing challenges, and the need for modifications. As a private university operating in Spain, the Madrid campus is required to follow Spanish labor laws which significantly impact hiring, promotion, the Madrid campus' academic schedule, and other areas that are articulated in the University Faculty Manual or regulated by United States fed eral or state laws. Accordingly, the faculty at the Madrid campus are not governed by the University Faculty Manual. Rather, along with administrative staff, they are bound to nationally -mandated employment agreements, the Estatuto de Los Trabajadores and the convenio for Spain's private university sector. In consultation with faculty and staff, Madrid leadership also developed an extensive faculty/staff website on which are published pol icies and procedures as well as rights, responsibilities, and privileges of Madrid campus faculty. However, throughout the past decade -and particularly in the past four years \u2014great strides have been made to ensure that, to as significant an extent as po ssible, faculty in Madrid and St. Louis work together to advance the institution's mission. A Madrid Faculty Academic Council was chartered in 2011; it will more formally establish the Madrid faculty's role in campus -level decision making and be the offic ial liaison with the St. Louis campus' Faculty Senate. Additionally, Madrid academic leadership is regularly represented on key University -wide committees, such as the Graduate Academic Affairs Committee (GAAC), the Undergraduate Academic Affairs Committe e (UAAC), CADD and the PCC. Phone and, increasingly, video - conferencing technologies have brought the two campuses much closer together, and have significantly facilitated shared governance and decision -making throughout the overall organization. The Staff Advisory Committee (SAC) represents the interests and concerns of the University staff to administration. Membership is open to any staff member who is not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Of ficers are elected annually. The president of SAC is a member of the President's Coordinating Council. Meetings of SAC are held monthly with the Vice President for Human Resources in attendance. SAC fulfills the following functions: 49 Chapter III: Criterion One to communicate the interests and concerns of a diverse University staff; to function in an advisory capacity in the development, review and implementation of University policies which affect staff; to provide a means of communication with the administration, faculty, and s tudents, and support them with the knowledge, skills, and abilities of the staff; and to create and nurture a spirit of unity among all employees at the University The Student Government Association (SGA) , chartered by th e University's Board of Trustees, is the governing body which oversees the governance and funding of student organizations and represents the students' perspective to administration. The SGA officers and senators are elected by the student body. The SGA charters all student organizations and nominates students to serve on University wide committees. Senators represent all colleges and schools, residents of every hall and apartment complex and commuters. In addition, there are senators representing the Bl ack Students Alliance (BSA), the International Student Federation (ISF), and first -year students. The Senate meets weekly to create and debate legislation concerning all aspects of student life. University officials are regular participants in SGA meeting s, communicating regarding institutional activities and proposals, and answering questions from student leaders. In May 2011, the President's Coordinating Council (PCC) approved the Student Government Association Statement of Shared Governance . Based on the shared governance provisions in the University's Faculty Manual , the SGA's statement recognizes that \"thorough and regular communication constitutes the basis for shared governance\" which it defines as follows: Shared governance is a representative p rocess that generally means that important areas of action will involve input from each of the institutional components in decision -making. These important areas of action typically include, but are not limited to, the budget of the University, tuition in creases, policy changes, academic restructuring, and plans for construction on, expansion of, or major renovations to any University campus. Regarding these matters, the student body shall customarily be represented through the presence of at least one st udent delegate who is either a member of Student Government Association or is appointed by Student Government Association. The delegate(s) will serve as a voice to promote the students' interests in accordance with the mission of the Student Government Association. The SGA statement also includes provisions specifying the Student Government Association as the official voice of the student body, the function and expectations of students in shared governance, and a corollary for the University administratio n. Core Component 1e The organization upholds and protects its integrity. The University's mission provides a bearing for the orienting of its activities, structures, and policies \u2014indeed, its institutional character. This is manifested in many wa ys: our graduation rates, treatment of student athletes, the ratio of full -time versus part -time faculty, our academic and operating policy development and review processes, our undergraduate and graduate curriculum proposal and assessment procedures, fac ulty and staff evaluation processes, layered rank and tenure process, and our Institutional Review Board (IRB) and grievance procedures. We continually seek transparency, consistency, and fairness in all that we do, and we acknowledge the internal and ext ernal obstacles to achieving that goal. The mission of Saint Louis University, grounded in Catholic -Judeo and Jesuit traditions, calls for the University and its constituents to aspire to ideals greater than those codified via government laws, rules, an d 50 Chapter III: Criterion One regulations. Therefore, the University has developed objectives and organizational structures to ensure its integrity in living the University values as well as full compliance local, state and federal laws. There are a variety of oversight bodies an d grievance procedures through which faculty, staff, students, and patients can bring to light any situations or actions that have or might compromise the integrity of the University. Of the 15 committees of the University's Board of Trustees, several \u2014including the Audit, Mission and Ministry, Human Resources, and Legal and Legislative committees -are charged with monitoring the effectiveness of the University in upholding laws and internal policies. Units such as University Audit Services and the Complianc e Department, as well committees and executives in the University, are dedicated to ensuring the policies and procedures are enforced and violations appropriately reported to the Board. Students The Student Handb ook outlines University policies and procedures that apply to students including the code of conduct, student organization policies, and residence life community living principles. The Student Code of Conduct , revised annually, outlines The Five Dimensions of the Saint Louis University Experience as the principal foundations of the Code. According to the Code, the Five Dimensions challenge all members of the University to strive for excellence, to become men an d women for others to integrate classroom and out -of classroom learning, to develop their talents through discovery and reflection, and to be concerned for each person ( cura personalis ). The Code of Conduct specifically outlines students' rights and respo nsibilities; conduct violations and procedures for hearing, reviewing and addressing those violations; as well as the penalties and outcomes which are dependent on the severity of the violations. The Behavioral Co ncerns Committee was formed to assess and respond to problematic student behavior that could lead to the harm of an individual or group. In doing so, the Committee takes a holistic and developmental approach. Because distinct national laws and cultura l norms shape any related laws and policies, SLU's Madrid campus has adopted its own Code of Conduct (Madrid) in order to address the specific needs and circumstances of the students who study in Madrid. Committees of the University Board of Trustees Academic Affairs Audit Buildings and Groun ds Clinical Affairs Development and Community Relations Executive Finance Human Resources Investment Legal and Legislature Marketing and Branding Mission and Ministry Nominating Research Student Development 51 Chapter III: Criterion One Student grievances related to academic matters are handled by the individual colleges and s chools. Each academic unit has developed its policies and processes for soliciting, documenting, deliberating and communicating about grievances (e.g., Athletic Training and Social Work ). Based on compelling national statistics about the prevalence of sexual misconduct occurring on college campuses, in 2010 a Sexual Assault Working Group (SAWG) was formed to examine the University's response to sexual misconduct. The SAWG is focused on responding to the mandates of the U.S. Department of Education's Dear Colleague Letter issued on April 4, 2011. SAWG's work is focusing on four distinct, but critical areas: prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery. The com mittee has researched best practices at other institutions and captured those practices in a reporting and response protocol. Another key outcome of the SAWG's work was the University's adoption of its Sexual A ssault Policy in August 2011 by the President's Coordinating Council (PCC). Historically, the University's Title IX coordinator has conducted sexual assault training with staff from Student Development, Campus Ministry, Athletics, Housing and Residence L ife, as well as University 101 instructors. Per the new policy, SLU students were required to complete a training program on the policy prior to registering for the spring 2012 semester. Similarly, all faculty and staff also will be required to complete this training. The purpose of the training is to inform the University community of the elements of the policy and its reporting mechanisms, and to outline behaviors that would reduce sexual assault. After the launch of the policy and accompanying training, the focus of the group will shift to developing a proposal for a violence prevention center, which will serve the entire campus community and focus on prevention, education, and outreach. The intention of the SAWG extends beyond wanting to model best practices and meet federal guidelines; at the heart of the policy is the intention to provide compassionate care for those impacted by sexual assault. Integrity is evidenced throughout the University's athletic programs , as well. SLU is a member of Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). SLU began the last decade in Conference USA, and joined the Atlantic 10 Conference beginning with the 2005 -2006 academic year. The University s 18 varsity intercollegiate athletic teams are listed in Figure 2 below: : Figure 2 : Varsity Athletic Teams by Gender Men's Sports Women's Sports Baseball Softball Basketball Basketball Cross -Country Cross -Country Soccer Soccer Swimming Swimming Tennis Tennis Track, Indoor Track, Indoor Track, Outdoor Track, Outdoor Field Hockey Volleyball 52 Chapter III: Criterion One The administration of the University's athletics program is conducted in accord with the governing rules of both the NCAA and Atlantic 10. The program's associate director responsible for complianc e and student services prepared a reference manual for compliance -related issues that brings together in one place all aspects of the compliance program, including policies, procedures, and applicable NCAA rules. Department of Athletics programs have had n o NCAA major infractions cases over the past decade. SLU participates in the NCAA's Athletics Certification program which requires a comprehensive self -study every ten years followed by a campus visit by a peer review team and subsequent review by the NCAA Committee on Athletics Certification. In September 2011, the Department of Athletics completed its most recent NCAA athletics certification self -study. As occurred with its last self -study and review in 2002 -2003, the NCAA Division I Committee on Athletics Certification certified SLU without conditions. While the Department of A thletics currently reports to SLU's president through the Vice President for Stu dent Development, the President has and demonstrates clear and direct oversight of the program in multiple ways , as detailed in th e recent self -study report . The NCAA's certifications of the program since 2002 evidence its ongoing integrity and ethical co nduct. The program's attention to gender equity and diversity issues is described in great detail in the recent self - study, and demonstrates its strong commitment to student -athletes and staff alike. For example: Over the most recent three years (2008 -2010) addressed in this report, the Department of Athletics' ongoing commitment to gender equity is reflected in the increased female athletic participation to 53% of total student -athlete participation. Retention data show that four key members of the D epartment's administration have been long -term contributors, averaging 20 years of service --and two of the last four athletic directors have been women, unusual in Division I. The University's commitment to recruiting diverse student -athletes is reflecte d in the upward trend in the percentages of black student -athletes, with a consistently growing percentage from 7% in 2008 to 10% in 2010. The number of underrepresented student -athletes on athletics aid (which increased 17.4% from 2008 to 2010) has kept pace with the increase in enrollment of underrepresented students in the overall undergraduate population. Both gender and other diversity issues are addressed through the University's Policy on Harassment, Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Policy (EEO Policy) , Hate Crimes and Bias Incident Protocol, as well extensive programming within the Department and at the University level . The Director of the Office of Diversity and Affirmative Action is designated as the University's Title IX Compliance Coo rdinator and reports to the President through the Office of the General Counsel. This individual also serves as co -chair of the President's Diversity Council (PDC). Faculty The rights of the University faculty are governed by the Faculty Manual , last r evised in its entirety and approved in 2006. The Faculty Manual outlines the rights, powers, privileges, and immunities of faculty members. Chief among the rights is academic freedom which is the free and unhampered pursuit and communication of knowledg e and truth. The Faculty Manual states that in a Catholic university the different ways that have been developed for searching for knowledge are recognized in their diversity. The path of scientific experimentation and discovery, the path of philosophi cal analysis, the path of experience and humanistic insight, and the path of Christian scripture and Judeo -Christian tradition are all taken together as yielding to men and women a knowledge of themselves and of the world. The Faculty Manual also sets forth the process through the Faculty Senate's Professional Relations Committee for adjudicating grievances and screening (1) appeals of non -renewals, (2) impositions of serious sanctions short of termination, and (3) appeals emerging from University process es related to violations of University policies on equal opportunity, harassment, or retaliation. Additional grievance procedures (i.e. formation/role of ad hoc judicial committees) 53 Chapter III: Criterion One pertaining to non -renewal of faculty contracts and procedures for termina tion also are clearly outlined in the Manual . Staff The Division of Human Resources maintains a website that includes policies relating to faculty and staff. All staff are evaluated on an annual basis. The e mployee performance evaluation process is founded on the University's employee code of conduct, Living the Mission . Specifically, Living the Mission articulates the Standards of Conduct for the Common Good and a set of Shared Values for the Common Good . Human Resources refers to these values as the 5 Cs: competence, conscience, compassion, commitment, and community. The staff performance communication program was revised in 2011 to ensure that individual and department goals are articulated and measured. The objective is to give employees the insight and skills required to analyze their own and others' behavior more effective ly, so they can then solve interpersonal and intergroup problems. Applications may include sensitivity training, team building, and survey research. Employees also can also report incidents they believe to violate University policies through their immedia te supervisor, the Office of Diversity and Affirmative Action, the Human Resources grievance process, and the University Whistleblower Hotline. The Division of Human Resources implements a full Staff Grievance Po licy. That policy begins by encouraging all employees to communicate their concerns with their colleagues and supervisors to facilitate fair, effective and efficient solutions for problems arising out of the employment relationship. Whenever a staff empl oyee feels that his or her concerns are not being adequately addressed through such communication, the Grievance Policy provides formal and progressive steps for working toward satisfactory resolution. In addition to the Staff Grievance Policy, the Univer sity has established a Staff Peer Review Policy , which includes a peer review hearing process to facilitate the fair and efficient resolution of those disputes that have a serious adverse impact on the employment relationship. Patients Saint Louis University understands that, as a health care provider, the institution must follow the privacy rules of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Beyond legal compliance with federal mand ates, SLU Care\u2014SLU's medical service practice \u2014has developed its own Patient's Rights Statement which evidences respect for the dignity of each person being treated in a SLU Care facility or by a SLUCare employee. 54 Chapter III: Criterion One Magis : Recommendations The mission of the University is a living and dynamic tradition grounded in the ideals of the Society of Jesus. The University must continuously examine how it adapt s, yet remain s faithful to, the huma nistic development of the whole person. In that spirit, each Self-Study chapter dedicated to the five HLC Criteria conclude s with recommendations for future action at SLU . Where applicable, recommendation s will be aligned with specific elements from the University Strategic Plan (strategic directions, critical success factors, and/ or operating principles), embed ding the work toward fulfillment of the recommendations in the ongoing strategic planning process. For Criterion One, the recommendations are presented in two groups. First is a set of recommendations focused on mission literacy, mission activities and related assessment efforts: Recommendation Strategic Plan Integration Establish specific goals for shared understanding of institutional missio n among University constituent s (undergraduate and post - baccalaureate students, faculty, staff, trustees, and alumni) and a corresponding assessment plan. Strategic Direction A: Improve Academic and Research Performance and Reputation Strategic Direction E: Develop Our People and Leadership Critical Success Factor 1: Academic and Research Index Critical Success Factor 5: Human Capital Index Enhance means to measure SLU's impact on internal and external constituents. Employ quantitative and qualitative methods to better understand how and to what extent mission - related activities transform SLU itself and the communities it serves. Strategic Direction A: Improve Academic and Research Performance and Reputation Strategic Direction E: Develop Our People an d Leadership Critical Success Factor 5: Human Capital Index Establish a process to contextualize our Catholic, Jesuit educational identity in the global communities we serve. Strategic Direction E: Develop Our People and Leadership Critical Success Fac tor 1: Academic and Research Index Critical Success Factor 5: Human Capital Index Because a transparent, well-understood governance structure facilitate s mission achievement , the following recommendations focus on codific ation of and communication regard ing existing governance structures : Recommendation Strategic Plan Integration Develop bylaws for all University governance committees/groups that do not currently have them; publish all such bylaws for regular University -wide access and review. Operati ng Principle 3: Accountability, Evaluation and Reward Systems Operating Principle 5: Communication Develop and publish University -wide a document that clearly articulates the relationships among University governance entities (e.g., Board of Trustees, P resident, Executive Staff Committee, President's Coordinating Council, Council of Academic Deans and Directors, Deans, Faculty Senate, etc.) Operating Principle 3: Accountability, Evaluation and Reward Systems Operating Principle 5: Communication Chapter IV Criterion Two: Preparing for the Future The organization's allocation of resources and its processes for evaluation and planning demonstrate its capacity to fulfill its mission, improve the quality of its education, and respond to future ch allenges and opportunities. 56 Chapter IV: Criterion Two Chapter IV: Criterion Two Core Component 2a The organization realistically prepares for a future shaped by multiple societal and economic trends. Strategic Planning In 2001, Saint Louis University undertook an e xtensive strategic planning process that provided four strategic directions : expanding research integrated with teaching, learning and service; advancing community with diversity; fostering technology dedica ted to student formation and generation of knowledge; and promoting continuous institutional learning and innovation. More specific, but still broadly -stated, goals were offered for each of the strategic dir ections. For example, under the strategic direction Expanding research integrated with teaching, leaning and service were the following: Goal 1: Build the infrastructure and refine the administrative systems that support research. Redesign and improve institutional systems that support high -quality research, including interdisciplinary efforts. Modernize the University's research facilities and equipment. Goal 2: Strengthen the culture that supports research integrated with teaching, learning, and ser vice. Attract and retain high -caliber faculty, other research/academic personnel, and students. Enhance the University's reward/accountability system to recognize excellence in research, teaching, outreach, grantsmanship, and administration. Increase fun ding that stimulates new research and outreach efforts and attracts more external support. Increase publicity about key University achievements in research, teaching, and outreach. Goal 3: Enhance the University's entrepreneurial environment . Expand part nerships with business and industry, government, and the not -for-profit sector, including community -based organizations and public institutions of higher education. Motivate, support, and reward entrepreneurial activity that facilitates research, pedagogi cal innovation, and outreach. These directions and goals provided a foundation of institutional focus on its mission and vision, while attending to multiple societal and economic trends. They also provided the directional basis on which many individual u nits developed and implement ed strategic plans or directions of their own (e.g., SLUCare , ITS, Facilities Services , Student Development ). University -wide strategic planni ng goals were intentionally defined broadly to encourage innovation within the plan; however, this resulted in difficulty in identifying standards against which to measure progress. Because of that design, while the strategic directions and goals certainl y were evident and referenced throughout the last decade, they did not always strongly defin e or direc t planning or assessment activities throughout the University in a cohesive, integrated way. 57 Chapter IV: Criterion Two In 2009, as Executive Staff Committee members discussed th e future of planning at SLU, a decision was made not to totally re-invent the existing University Strategic Plan, but to sustain what was working while bringing those aspects of the plan in line with current social, global, and economic necessities. Accordingly, the Vice President for Academic Affairs began the process of updating the Strategic Plan via a document titled Shaping the Strategy , which focused on refining the 2001 University Strategic Plan by integrating the core ideology of Catholic Jesuit education, the 2001 strategic directions, and opportunities for meeting global challenges as identified by the Millennium Project . These expanded directions are more inclusive of st udent enrollment and retention, and advancing academic excellence as well as health care and professional practice. For each direction, specific goals were proposed to provide consistent measurements and greater unity. Using Ignatian values, the shaping also defined these five focal points: sustainability; health care improvement, education, access and affordability; social justice; science and technology for humanity; and ethical decision making. The shaping document received a mixed reception, part icularly from faculty. The Vice President for Academic Affairs then met with academic units to review the issues raised by the document, including the process by which it was created. The result of these discussions was the fall 2010 appointment by the V ice President of a faculty \"think tank\" charged with drafting a framing document to provide context for a new institutional strategic planning initiative. The focus of this effort was academic strategic planning, which is understood to be the driver for s trategic planning throughout the University. The new process will be adapted by the operating units (e.g., business and finance , facilities, etc. ) to develop their own, complementary, strategic plans to support identified academic and research priorities. The think tank worked throughout the fall 2010 semester; its efforts were affirmed by the President's Coordinating Council (PCC) on December 16, 2010. The purpose of this Strategic Planning Framing Document is to provide a focused vision to the Academic Strategic Planning process. This document renews Saint Louis University's commitment, and adds context, to its institutional mission, reflects on the Universi ty's unique heritage, and guides the identification of key challenges and opportunities for distinctive contributions in the future. The Academic Strategic Planning Group will use this document to develop specific strategic goals, operational plans, and e valuation metrics that will guide future academic progress . With this guiding framework in place, in spring 2011 the Vice President for Academic affairs commenced discussion on the St. Louis campus regarding several key planning -related topics : the chara cteristics of Jesuit education , faculty evaluation (i.e., teaching effectiveness, research/scholarly productivity/impact, and service contributions/impact), and academic administrator evaluation. Similar conversations have been ongoing in Madrid, where th e faculty and administration turn to St. Louis counterparts for direction and adapt criteria to both the academic culture and employment conditions in Spain. Committees composed of faculty, staff/administrators, and students studied these topics and sough t out best practices throughout the year. The resulting committee reports were distributed University -wide in November 2011 and presented in an open forum on the St. Louis campus. Feedback received at the forum and via email provided guidance to the commi ttees in revising their reports and recommendations. Concurrent ly, the academic deans and vice presidents developed Process Enneagrams to both begin strategic planning for their units and to form the basis for institution -wide discussion and planning. The Process Enneagram is a tool that can be used to review an organization's current state, consider its desired state, and identify what needs to be done to move the organization from its current to desired state. It reflects an organization as a living system, with numerous, dynamic connections, the interplay of which is crucial to the organization's well being. 58 Chapter IV: Criterion Two In 2011, to further clarify the President's vision of making Saint Louis University the finest Catholic University in the nation, the Univers ity's Executive Staff Committee adopted the University's Strategic Intent to be recognized among the Top 50 universities in the U.S. In June 2011, the Executive Staff Committee and all academic deans participated in a planning retreat which resulted in th e development of draft versions of : (1) a revised set of Strategic Directions (echoing the 2001 Strategic Plan), ( 2) Strategic Planning Operating Principles , and ( 3) Performance Standards. Finally, a Strategic Planning Subcommittee of the Executive Staff Committee developed a list of Critical Success Factors that could be linked with the Strategic Directions . The first complete draft of the FY 2013 -2017 University -Level Strategic Plan was endorsed by the Executive Staff Committee in October 2011. There after, the Plan was reviewed by various stakeholder groups, edited , and approved by the President's Coordinating Council on November 15, 2011. Next, the President made some editorial changes and approved the Plan on December 6, 2011. The updated Plan approved by the University's Board of Trustees on December 10, 2011 , is presented in Figure 3 below: Figure 3: FY2013 -2017 University Strategic Plan University -Level Strategic Plan FY2013 -FY2017 Strategic Intention and Strategic Directions Saint Louis University (SLU) is ranked among the top 100 national universities, among the top Catholic universities in the United States, and among leading American universities with an autonomous foreign campus. As a multinational, Catholic, Jesuit University, SLU's strategic intention is to continue to prepare the next generation of global leaders through a distinctively Catholic, Jesuit educational experience and to continuously improve its quality across all academic and operational units. The university seeks to pursue its strategic intention along the following five strategic directions. A. Improve Academic and Research Performance and Reputation: Improve academic and research performance leading to increased reputation of excellence in student learning, research a nd health care (e.g., ranked among top 50 national universities) and globalization of the overall educational experience. B. Utilize Prudent Fiscal Management to Build on Financial Strength: Exercise strong financial management through prudent budgeting and j udicious strategic programmatic investment. C. Grow and Improve Clinical Care Business: Strive for continued growth, regional expansion and profitability and increasingly synergistic relationships with hospital partners D. Continue Campus and Community Developm ent: Provide an attractive and safe environment, as well as specific programs, that contribute to the recruitment and retention of students, patients, faculty and staff and engage in active community development through academic, co -curricular, and service projects. E. Develop our People and Leadership: Provide comprehensive leadership development aligned with strategic goals of the institution as well as support development of the individual person. Operating Principles and Performance Standards Saint Loui s University's leadership team will observe the following five operating principles and four performance standards in pursuing the above strategic directions and subsequent achievement of the strategic intention. 1. Benchmarking: Each academic and operationa l unit, managed by its vice president, will develop its own performance criteria and standards in accordance with the university -wide benchmarking guidelines and use the benchmarking approach to recommend performance 59 Chapter IV: Criterion Two improvements, best practice implementat ion, resource investment and reallocation, and discontinuance of ineffective/inefficient practices or policies. 2. Goal Setting : Each academic and operational unit, managed by its vice president, will develop its own measurable performance goals, align those goals with team -level, and individual -level performance goals, annually evaluate the progress, and make timely corrections to the implementation strategies/tactics. Budget models and investment decisions will be consistent with the set goals. A matrix of strategic direction versus unit goals will be maintained to track performance. 3. Accountability, Evaluation and Reward Systems: All personnel in supervisory capacity (e.g., managers, directors, department chairs, deans, vice presidents) will be accountable for their actions and inactions. Evaluation of individuals as well as programs will be conducted with respect to the pre -agreed goals, timelines, and resources available to achieve those goals. Reward systems will include base salary adjustments, variable pay, and non -financial recognition. Both individual and team rewards/recognition will be considered. Measurement of success will be based on objective criteria and performance standards. While staff and faculty performance criteria may be different, the ov erall expectation of commitment to the University's Catholic Jesuit mission, professionalism, and continuous improvement apply to all. Annual budget decisions will be consistent with the University -level strategic plan as well as unit -level strategic plan s and performance goals. 4. Innovation: Innovation will be encouraged across all academic, research, service, business, and technological aspects of the University. Inherent in such initiatives is a certain degree of risk; however, innovation is an essential element of institutional progress and therefore a select number of innovative projects will be supported. Appropriate approval channels must be utilized, risks and rewards must be clearly identified, performance metrics must be agreed upon, and an exit st rategy must be delineated prior to the formal approval of the proposal. 5. Communication: Each academic and operational unit, managed by its vice president, will develop communication and dissemination protocols that will keep all stakeholders informed and appropriate parties engaged, with timely, relevant, and clear messaging on key initiatives. Multiple and appropriate communication channels, including annual status reports on strategic initiatives, will be used. Performance Standards The structure of performance standards presented here is intended to develop a clear sense of how a particular individual's performance contributes toward the University's strategic intentions. 1. Individual: Each individual faculty, staff, or faculty -administrator, in cons ultation with his/her supervisor (department chair, manager, director, etc.), will develop performance goals prior to the beginning of the review period and will be held accountable to achieve the set goals. The supervisor will be expected to consider benc hmark performance characteristics, resources provided, and overall significance of the performance in achieving the unit's mission. 2. Team : In some cases, multiple individuals may be assessed as a team. The team assessment may be in addition to or in lieu of individual assessment. The appropriate supervisors will consult with each other as well as all the team members to develop the performance metrics. Teams may be formed within or across academic and/or operational units as well as between or across facul ty, staff and faculty -administrators. 3. Unit: Each academic and operational unit, in consultation with its vice president, will develop its own strategic plan and corresponding performance goals. These strategic plans and the respective performance goals w ill be tied to discipline -specific benchmarks as well as overall university -level strategic intentions. 60 Chapter IV: Criterion Two 4. University: The University's success will be measured along the following five Critical Success Factors: (1) Academic and Research Index, (2) Financia l Strength Index, (3) 5. Clinical Quality and Sustainability Index, (4) Campus Infrastructure and Environment Index, and (5) Human Capital Index Each vice president, in consultation with the President, will develop and maintain a current list of performance goals that will collectively advance the University's strategic intentions and demonstrate progress along the five Critical Success Factors. The executive team (all vice presidents and the President) will review progress along these goals and make appropr iate changes to strategies, policies, tactics, resource allocation, personnel assignments, or structures. Periodic Review This University -level Strategic Plan was endorsed by the President's Coordinating Council on November 15, 2011; the final version was approved by the President on December 6, 2011; and subsequently approved by the Board of Trustees on December 10, 2011. The first draft of unit -level strategic plans/initiatives and performance goals, consistent with the University - level Strategic Plan, will be developed by April 1, 2012. The University -level Strategic Plan and the Unit -level strategic plans will be reviewed collectively for coherence and consistency, appropriate changes will be made, and presented to the respective committees of t he Board at the May 2012 meeting. Thereafter, all the Unit - level plans/updates will be reviewed annually by the respective committees of the Board and the University - level Strategic Plan will be reviewed by the full Board of Trustees at its annual May mee ting until further notice. The iterative planning process is shown in Figure 4. Benchmarking, identified as Operating Principle #1 in the University Strategic Plan, is a significant facet of the new planning process and has begun in the academic and admi nistrative units in both St. Louis and Madrid. A benchmarking process framework, developed by the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs and approved by the Executive Staff Committee, was implemented in spring 2011 . Units are to determine perf ormance indicators to benchmark and then identify other institutions (competitor, peer, national aspirational, and global aspirational) against which they can benchmark themselves with those indicators in their pursuit of excellence. Units have the latitu de to determine their respective indicators as well as benchmark institutions. Hence, while the process is a standard one, it acknowledges disciplinary differences. Faculty and staff are encouraged and expected to communicate their observations, question s, and suggestions through their department administrators, governance bodies, and the committees formed to address specific aspects of the process. The Top 50 goal and benchmarking require the establishment of performance metrics, the assessment of progr ess, and the alignment of reward systems with performance . It is anticipated that budget priorities will emerge from the process, providing clear direction for resource allocation through the University's budget process. Regular and continuous assessment of priorities is built into the process. July 1, 2018 \u2014the year of the University's 200th anniversary \u2014is targeted as the date by which this goal will be achieved. The component steps and initial timeline of the process were summarized in presentation s made to the faculty by the Vice P resident of Academic Affairs, again in open fora, and subsequently distributed via e -mail. An Interdisciplinary Approach to Education Interdisciplinarity is needed more than ever in our increasingly interdependent and resour ce-challenged world. Based on strong disciplinary foundations, and through improved knowledge integration and the subsequent direction of resources toward shared interests and goals, we are more likely to optimize the outcomes of our efforts. Accordingly , Saint Louis University effec tively supports and encourages an interdisciplinary environment through its programming as well as innovative organizational structures. 61 Chapter IV: Criterion Two Figure 4: Iterative Strategic Planning Implementation Process An exceptional ex ample is SLU's Interprofessional Education (IPE) Program , whose faculty teach students how their own and other professions collaborate to provide holistic patient care. Begun in 2006 as part of the core curriculum embedde d in the curricula of the School of Nursing and the Doisy College of Health Sciences, and with undergraduates as its focus, the IPE program has expanded into the post -baccalaureate and professional curricula in medicine, accelerated nursing, physician assi stant education, and social work. SLU also supports the development of interdisciplinary academic centers , which are frequently more flexible and can facilitate collaboration in ways the University's traditional structures have not, resulting in more innovative research and teaching and the attraction of external funding. But while the curricular aspects of emergent interdisciplinary centers are addressed through the Undergraduate (UAAC) and Graduate (GAAC) Academic Affairs Committees (the University's standing curriculum committees at the undergraduate and graduate/professional levels), administrative infrastructure elements such as faculty appointment, hiring, governance, and tenure/advancement procedures remain concerns. Also of note is that in 2002, the HLC site visit team observed in its report that The number of colleges/schools is extensive for the size of the university. At the time, this was expressed only as a fiscal concern. Adding centers and related structures create additional fiscal, o perational, and governance considerations that strategic planning can help to clarify. 62 Chapter IV: Criterion Two Analogous to the benefits accrued from interdisciplinary efforts, partnerships with other entities that can enhance and augment the University's educational mission a re critical. Accordingly, SLU has committed fiscal and human resources to support collaborative initiatives locally, nationally, and internationally with a variety of organizations, communities, and other educational institutions. Examples: At a local l evel, SLU's Center for Service and Community Engagement (CSCE) , founded in 2009, links students, faculty, staff, and community partners through service, community -based learning, and research. In so doing, it he lps prepare University participants to be effective servant leaders and agents for social change while fostering the creation of a just and equitable society through its support of the partner entities. SLU's School of Public Health is leading the landmark National Children's Study , the largest U.S. study ever conducted to learn about children's health and development. Planned to continue for 21 years and involve more than 100,000 children, it is being p iloted in St. Louis and is expected to expand to 105 locations. Our Center for World Health & Medicine , a unique non -profit entity established in 2010 with a two - year $5 M commitment by the University to get it s tarted. Its staff of pharmaceutical scientists formerly worked at the St. Louis location of Pfizer, Inc., the world's largest research -based pharmaceutical company. When Pfizer announced the closing of that location, SLU jumped on the opportunity to invi te these scientists to join the University and apply their efforts toward the discovery and development of new drugs to treat diseases that primary affect poor and underserved patient populations globally. The Center's staff works in collaboration with co lleagues at the University of Missouri -St. Louis, and Canadian and Chinese universities. The University mission is supportive of meeting the changing needs of society and industry . These are just a few examples that reflect SLU's commitment to develop a culture incorporating not only traditional academic programming, but professional development and lifelong learning needs that reflect a living and vital SLU mission: New academic programs implemented within the last two years such as civil engineering and undergraduate programs in public health ; New partnerships with industry such as Quantum WeatherTM, a weather monitoring, forecasting, and response system for Ameren Missouri's service territory; Multiple methods for the delivery of education including Tegrity Lecture Capture and the Learning Studio , a state -of-the-art teaching space; Creation of a Center for Global Citizenship to bring together under one roof the University's academi c and support units having international foci (i.e., Office of International Services, International Studies Program, and English as a Second Language Program) ; Expansion of the Reinert Center for Tea ching Excellence to provide more instructional design support; and The 2010 establishment of the independent, degree -granting Center for Sustainability that incorporates course work from such divergent areas as public policy, business, engineering, social work, and biology to prepare students to take on the challenges of a world in environmental peril. Toward Leadership in Global Education Over the past 10 years, SLU has embraced the challenges and opportuniti es presented by increasing globalization . Starting in 2009, with the reshaping of the University's 2001 Strategic Plan, this has become a more intentional focus across academic units and initiatives (although some units have been very globally - focused for years; the Boeing Institute of International Business is celebrating its 20th anniversary in 2011 - 2012). According to the Millennium Project initiated by the United Nations Univer sity and its partners, there are 15 interdependent global challenges of the 21st Century that must be addressed to create a sustainable future. A cross -mapping of the principles of a Jesuit education and these global challenges yield the following six areas in which SLU can develop and exercise leadership in a global world: sustainability, 63 Chapter IV: Criterion Two poverty reduction, healthcare improvement, social justice, science and technology for humanity, and ethical decision making. Recent initiatives foreshadow significan t efforts by the University to expand global operations and impact . In spring 2012, the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs released an initial draft of a new Comprehensive Internationalization Plan, which includes a vision (developed by a 2 0+ member Vision Team) and plan for implementation (implementation teams across the University are being planned). The plan's vision is as follows: As a multinational, Catholic, Jesuit University, Saint Louis University's strategic intention is to contin ue to prepare the next generation of global leaders through distinctively Catholic, Jesuit educational experience s and to continuously improve its quality across all academic and operational units (Saint Louis University, Strategic Plan FY2013 -FY2017, Appe ndix A). As a Catholic, Jesuit institution we are compelled to ensure that the University and the next generation of graduates are equipped to deal with the global reconfiguration of economies, relations, research, and communication , as well as the impac t of global forces on local life , in an ethical and humane manner. While this is an ambitious project, with a renewed commitment to strengthen SLU's Madrid campus, the emerging Center for Global Citizenship on the St. Louis campus, a wide array of study -abroad programs, faculty/student exchange programs, joint/dual degree partnerships across the world, and growth in the number of trustees with multinational experience and interests, Father Biondi, S.J. has built a state of readiness for globalization. Further, SLU already has entr\u00e9es into international education, service, and research (see SLU-International Programs website http://www.slu.edu/x52286.xml ). As a Jesuit institution, globalization is a part of Saint Louis University's DNA. In recognition of the global network of the Society of Jesus, Superior General Adolfo Nicol\u00e1s, S.J. has put forth a call to actualize the potential our Jesuit network affords us. Saint Louis University's Catholic, Jesuit mission compels us to support the development of global citizens who can serve humanity in light of the growing complexities of our world. At Saint Louis University, global citizens are defined as people who are adept at understanding, valuing, and transitioning cultures and globalization issues; committed to improving socio -environmental conditions through ethical application of their knowledge and skills; and successful at garnering resources to accomplish their goals. The notion of global citizenship is a s tate of mind, and this mindset is created through a multitude of interactive experiences and learning opportunities that stimulate multi -cultural thinking ; involve cross -cultural exchange ; foster deep intellectual dialogue about values, customs and traditi ons, attitudes and opinions, and behaviors in different cultures ; expose students to globalization concepts and opportunities across a variety of disciplines ; and teach skills to build bridges across cultures based on humanistic values and mutual respect. To achieve comprehensive globalization, SLU will need to build upon its current international programming and Catholic, Jesuit commitment. It will need to develop a distinctive, integrated multinational experience that brings together community, academi a, research centers , and industry to ultimately establish an international network of committed individuals and pre -eminent institutions that are collectively dedicated to the preparation of global citizens. To fully realize the call of Superior General A dolfo Nicol\u00e1s, S.J. , their experiences must be intentionally integrated into the University's beliefs, values, structures , and practices. Saint Louis University must address both globalization and internationalization. 64 Chapter IV: Criterion Two Many of SLU's global education e fforts have their roots in the University's Madrid, Spain , campus. In the mid-1990s, Madrid f aculty and administration strategically responded to demographic changes in Spain and expanded their efforts to recruit new student populations from across Europe , North Africa, and Middle East. The result was a change in the identity of the Madrid campus, from a study abroad program/two -year program for Spanish students to an academic community hosting over 60 nationalities. International students attracted to S LU's Jesuit, liberal arts model of education as well as to the vibrant city of Madrid, however, were often choosing to transfer to universities other than SLU for a variety of reasons: the combined expense of travel and tuition; increasingly rigorous Depar tment of Homeland Security regulations; and the preference to complete their studies in Europe or in another region of the U.S. In response to this trend, the Madrid campus \u2014in collaboration with academic departments in St. Louis \u2014has developed full -degree programs in Madrid, including bachelor's programs in communication, economics, English, international business, nursing, political science , and Spanish as well as master's programs in English and Spanish. One result of this new programming is that s tudent s who would otherwise transfer from the Madrid campus to another university now complete their SLU degrees in Madrid, a number that has increased steadily since the campus' first commencement ceremony in 2005. The development and delivery of these new pro grams have also led to the better alignment of academic programs and increased communication between the Madrid campus and St. Louis departments and schools. In addition, the process has educated St. Louis faculty and administrators about the opportunitie s in Madrid and engaged their Madrid counterparts in conversations that lead to better academic coordination and a firmer foundation on which the University can distinguish itself as a leader in international education. Collaboration with Business and Ind ustry The University is highly supportive of efforts by individual colleges/schools to customize programming to fit the changing needs of business and industry. For example, the School for Professional Studies (SPS) offers onsite programs with The Boeing Company , the BJC Healthcare Center for Lifelong Learning , and St. Anthony's Medical Center that are developed to address the specific educational needs of each constituent. Responding to the Changing Economic Climate Prudent financial planning has been key to the University's very successful weathering of the most recent (and still current) national and international financi al crisis. Many institutions with substantial endowments rivaling SLU's ($500 M to $1 billion) rely more heavily on endowment revenues to support annual operating expenses and, as a result, were harder hit by the recession. While SLU did see its endowment peak at $960 M in 2007 and fall to $646 M in 2009, the campus -wide impact of that decline was less than experienced at other institutions. According to a report from the National Council of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO), i n the past fiv e years SLU has annually spent, on average, nearly 1% less of its endowment than its counterparts with si milarly -sized endowments (see Figure 5). That SLU' s endowment had climbed back to approximately $880 M at the close of FY2011 is impressive \u2014but, consid ering the institution's conservative spend rate, even that increase did not dramatically alter annual revenues as it would at other institutions . Figure 5: Endowment Value and Effective Spend Rates 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Endowment Value $960M $880M 65 Chapter IV: Criterion Two A second key to sustaining fiscal and operation al stability is the University's recognition of a shift to a focus on net tuition reve nue. By diversifying its student body across multiple sectors \u2014traditional -aged first -time, first year students; international students; non -traditional adult students; internet -based students \u2014and by emphasizing net tuition revenue across all those sectors , SLU has been able to achieve financial success without the same emphasis on traditional student enrollment numbers and corresponding tuition discount rate that had, in previous years, more narrowly defined financial planning. A snapshot of overall enrol lment is provided in Figure 6. Figure 6 : Enrollment Snapshot 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Undergraduate 10,936 11,424 11,977 12,225 Safety, Emergency Preparedness, and Business Continuity In the past decade, several events with national \u2014even international \u2014repercussions served as wake -up calls to many institutions, including Saint Louis Univer sity. Hurricane Katrina commanded the attention of colleges and universities that had no established plans for continuing institutional business in the wake of natural disasters or other large -scale crises. The tragic shootings at Virginia Tech in 2007 a nd at Northern Illinois University in 2008 raised campus awareness about student behavioral concerns, safety, and institutional intervention. SLU had begun to engage in a revision of its student conduct code prior to these campus shootings, but th ose events added another dimension to the conversation. Faculty and student development staff alike recognized the need to be able to distinguish between disruptive and distressed student behavior (the former manifesting in classroom civility issues and the lat ter in mental health and well -being issues), and the different approaches required to address and resolve them successfully. The Behavioral Concerns Committee was formed as the vehicle through which care of indi vidual students, balanced against the needs of the SLU community, would be coordinated among the University's health, counseling, and disabilities services personnel, the Office of Student Conduct, and the faculty. SLU's Department of Public Safety and Se curity Services (DPSSS) has made major strides in raising the University community's awareness of the need for improved safety and emergency preparedness and in developing and implementing related plans. As of 2008, DPSSS coordinates all of the University 's preparedness activities and maintains the St. Louis Campus Emergency Operations Plan (based on the National Incident Management System and Incident Command System). It also organized and oversees the Campus Em ergency Response Team (CERT) , a Student Government Association (SGA) -chartered organization begun in 2009 that brings students, faculty, and staff together to train to and respond to campus emergencies of all kinds. The University's Emergency Notificatio n System, also supported by DPSSS, is routinely tested and modified to take advantage of new technology and messaging formats. The Division of Information Technology Services (ITS) spent over a year developing its Business Continuity and Disaster Recover y Plan that includes business impact analyses for numerous units of the University, a risk 66 Chapter IV: Criterion Two analysis, the creation of contingency and continuity plans, and an outline of recovery priorities and recovery plans for all aspects of information technology. A se ries of tests and evaluations are incorporated into the plan. SLU's Backup and Business Continuity Policy was implemented in May 2010 \" to ensure al l confidential information is properly backed up (either fully or incrementally) and all associated systems remain functional, reliable and able to continue operations in the event of an emergency.\" This includes the Blackboard course management system (k nown as SLU Global). Every course recognized by the Banner system has a course shell in place on this system, facilitating the continued delivery of SLU curricula should there occur a serious disruption of service on campus. Sustainability Via a unique p artnership between an academic program \u2014SLU's Center for Sustainability \u2014and the Division of Facilities Services, SLU is advancing the operational dimensions of sustainability throughout campus. The partnership between faculty and leaders of the Center and staff of Facilities Services has helped the University embrace sustainability as an ongoing, holistic an d interdisciplinary venture. According to the SLUstainability website , Sustainability is not a destination but an ever evolving work in progress. Facilities Services is rigorously integrating sustainability into the University's vision to be recognized as the premier urban campus in the United States. Sustainability is addressed in a multi -faceted manner, a s evidenced by a ttention to buildings and grounds; recycling, composting and waste reduction; purchasing policies and procedures; utilities and energy management; transportation and fuel use. Core Component 2b The organization's resource base suppor ts its educational programs and its plan for maintaining and strengthening their quality in the future. Budget Saint Louis University is able to actively support its educational goals and mission because it is financially secure, even in a volatile fina ncial market. The University has established itself as fiscally responsible when making decisions on spending to protect the University endowment and prepare for the future, while contributing new spending annually in areas that align with the University mission, including significant contributions in the form of operating dollars, personnel, and facility resources. Figure 7 , an excerpt from SLU's most recent K PMG independent financial audit, demonstrate s the scope of SLU's overall annual financial operati ons and the health of those operations. SLU continues to operate in line with its budget forecasts, and maintains positive balances appropriate for an institution of its size and scope to both ensure annual financial viability and long -term sustainability . This is accomplished while, as the independent audit data show, awarding over $100 M annually in financial aid allowances. The Operating Budget Process Opportunities for strategic investment in people, programs , and infrastructure are evaluated conti nuously, and always in the context of a mature understanding of the general higher education environment as well as state, national, and international political environments. That understanding is manifested in the annual budgeting process , which begins i n September with a period of formal environmental scan. October and November in each budgeting cycle are filled with budget planning meetings for deans, the President's Coordinating Council (PCC), and the Executive Staff Committee . Unit budget recommenda tions are developed throughout those months, and are formally submitted through respective vice presidents as recommendations to the president in November. Ultimately, a complete proposed budget is developed and submitted to the University Board of Truste es for review and approval in December, for implementation the following July 1. As on the St. Louis campus, the budget process on the Madrid campus anticipates enrollment projections; tuition and financial aid awards are projected both to attract visi ting US students (roughly 30% discounted in 67 Chapter IV: Criterion Two comparison to SLU St. Louis tuition) and to compete with private institutions of higher education in Spain and Europe . The Bologna Process , implement ed in 2009, as well as the growing number of degree programs in Spain and Europe in which the language of instruction is English , increase the options available to Spanish and other international students. Discussions about new markets, developing new programs, and positioning the institution securely in the midst o f Spain's harsh economic climate remains a priority for the Vice President for Academic Affairs and faculty and administrators in Madrid. Figure 7 : Except from FY2011 KPMG Independent Annual Audit Report 68 Chapter IV: Criterion Two A New Vision and Financial Model for Graduate Education In 2009, the University administration decided to reorganize graduate education at Saint Louis University with the goals of sustaining the quality of graduate education, while enhancing the flexibility of individual colleges and schools to establish programming and manage resources. A transition team was formed to facilitate the reorganization which became effective on July 1, 2010. The Faculty Senate requested that the reorganization include a University -wide office and administrativ e position to provide quality assurance for all programs. A parallel committee to the Undergraduate Academic Affairs Committee (UAAC) \u2014the Graduate Academic Affairs Committee (GAAC) \u2014was created to replace the Graduate School's Board of Graduate Studies. Prior to the reorganization, the Graduate School housed all PhD, MA, and MS programs as well as some professional post -baccalaureate programs. Other professional post -baccalaureate programs were housed within their respective college s/school s/center s. Per the recommendations of the 35 -member Graduate Transition Team, all post -baccalaureate programs are now under the Graduate Education umbrella for purposes of assuring program quality. Program approval/review and policy formulation affecting all graduate programs are overseen by GAAC, which makes recommendations to the Vice President for Academic Affairs concerning programs and policies. Most financial resources were reallocated to the appropriate college/school/center when the Graduate School was dissolv ed. Each college/school/center submitted a report outlining the professional staffing needed to accommodate the shifting workload. This report also included a summary of current and desired assistantship funding levels and numbers. Because of its secure financial base, Saint Louis University was able to provide $4.5M in new funding to hire the needed staff, and increase both the number of assistantships and assistantship funding levels across the University. This shift better allows SLU to respond to the increasing interest in and need for post -baccalaureate education as reported by US News and Educational Testing Services. The key staff position resultant from the Transition Team's recommendations and independent input from the Faculty Senate was an A ssociate Vice President for Graduate Education, who came to the University in June 2011 with extensive experience in graduate education, both centralized and decentralized. This position reports to the Vice President for Academic Affairs (who also created a parallel position for undergraduate education). Beyond implementing the new structure, the new associate vice president has reached out to the faculty to explain how the new structure is meant to work, what its first initiatives have been, processes fo r ongoing review, and future planning. An early accomplishment is the move to electronic submission of all theses and dissertations and creation of an online application process. All graduate policies are being reviewed and changes have been made to prov ide quality assurance but allow for flexibility in implementation given the breadth of programs now under Graduate Education. Programs not previously under the old Graduate School structure have brought their policies and procedures in line with other gra duate programs and have their candidacy process es coordinated by staff in Graduate Education. Future tasks include workshops for faculty thesis/dissertation advisors; the development of a Preparing Future Faculty Program; submission of grant proposals fo r diversity recruitment, scholarly integrity, and thesis/dissertation awards; exploration of new joint/dual degree programs and adoption of professional science master's degrees; and the expansion of international opportunities for SLU graduate students. All of these and still other plans have been identified in the context of changing U.S. demographics, graduate degree completion rate trends, changing workforce needs, and internationalization. Planning and Budgeting to Support New Academic Programs Units proposing new academic programs must demonstrate the program's financial feasibility. Specifically, the unit must identify any new financial resources anticipated in their first five years of operation and adhere to a specific timeline in making their ne w program request so that deliberation of the proposal is coordinated with the University's planning and budget/process cycles. The resource needs may include new staffing for teaching or support functions within the unit. Additionally, reviews are requi red of library and information technology resources necessary for the successful conduct of the program; these reviews are conducted 69 Chapter IV: Criterion Two independently by subject liaison librarians and Information Technology Services (ITS) staff, respectively, and submitted th rough their vice presidents. Chairs of the home department are expected to meet with the Assistant Vice President of Academic Affairs for Finance to discuss the budget for the new program and develop a Pro-Forma 5 -Year Budget . The Assistant Vice President subsequently offers a formal recommendation regarding the proposed program's financial viability to the Vice President for Academic Affair s. Following a recommendation for approval by the appropriate University -level curriculum committee , every proposal also must be approved by the Vice President for Academic Affairs and the Board of Trustees. Supporting Education Outside the Classroom Beyond the evidenced support for curricular programs that sustain student learning, Saint Louis University is committed to the establishment and growth of co -curricular learning opportunities that aid in student academic success, and promote the connection fo r students of their in -class and out -of-class experiences. Research of best practices on the national level, thorough review of student feedback regarding their on - campus experiences, as well as review of faculty and staff experiences , provide support for the allocation of significant financial resources to co -curricular initiatives to support student learning and retention. These initiatives include, but are not limited to: The establishment of a Student Succes s Center as a one -stop-shop for academic and career success on the Frost Campus (2009) and later at the Medical Center (2010), tallying nearly 9,000 student visits in the past academic year. Services available include academic support (tutoring/supplemen tal instruction), writing services, academic accommodations for students with disabilities, career counseling and preparation, and academic advising. The shift to a campus -wide Integrated Academic Advising and Mentoring system assigns each undergraduate s tudent an academic advisor and faculty mentor aligned with the individual colleges/ schools, who collectively aid students in their decision - making through their academic career at SLU. The development of Learning Communities which engage undergraduate st udents living together in residential communities where their coursework, service, and social activities are all designed to promote a learning lifestyle, as are 21 related First -Year Interest Groups (FIGs) which are small groups of first -year students liv ing within each Learning Community who take one to three courses together. Support for Libraries SLUs libraries build and preserve their collections to inspire discovery and investigation into ideas and issues, past and present. The collections comprise an ever -growing archive of human intellectual life and imagination, and catalyze the innovative teaching and research that characterize the Jesuit tradition of free inquiry. Academic and library faculty collaborate to select materials (in any format) base d on curricular and faculty research needs. Unless limited by licensing, electronic resources are available anytime and anywhere to all current SLU students, faculty, and staff. Electronic resources represent an ever -increasing segment of the libraries' budget (75% in FY12). Even so, many needed resources are unavailable electronically or are out of reach financially in that format. Rapid technological and publishing changes exacerbate these common economic challenges. The elimination of journal subscr iptions has, in fact, been a necessity since mid -decade, and has been driven largely by usage data. The consequences of this action have been mitigated through prudent and effective use of consortia subscriptions, on demand agreements with publishers, and increased used of interlibrary loan. The challenges posed by escalating costs associated with increased employment of electronic resources will need to be met with similar creativity and commitment to academic and research excellence. Faculty Compens ation Faculty salaries is a topic about which both faculty and University administration need to identify a shared methodology for measuring progress toward a clearly articulated goal. Th e lack of a shared goal limits understanding of and shared progress toward meeting both faculty and institutional needs. Such a goal should emerge from the current strategic planning process in which compensation practices are competitively 70 Chapter IV: Criterion Two benchmarked against appropriate institutions , and appropriate cost -of-living adjus tments are applied to normalize the salary analysis . A cohesive, competitive, long -term faculty compensation plan grounded in productive faculty -administration dialogue will undergird the University's commitment to achieving a Top 50 ranking \u2014something tha t cannot be accomplished and sustained without the high quality faculty who support the institution's educational programs. Advancement Resources Donations to the University provide significant financial support in a number of areas, and come from a variety of donors (see Figure 8 ). While a relatively small portion of the University's general operating budget is funded by restricted gifts, there are hundreds of endowed and restricted funds that help support a myriad of initiatives and projects. Also, gro wing gift revenue helps relieve the need for funding from the general operating budget or debt service. Most major building projects on campus have fundraising expectations with them. Most recently, Advancement officers have been raising money for the He alth Sciences Education Union, the Center for Global Citizenship, and the Medical Center Stadium. Significant fundraising was conducted to support construction of the Doisy Research Center and Chaifetz arena. As the need for student aid has increased, s o too has the need for more gifts to support scholarships and assistantships. Since FY2007, the University has raised more than $31M for scholarships alone. More gift - funded scholarships help reduce the amount of tuition discounting required to recruit a nd retain students. Additionally, the deans and directors of SLU's colleges, schools , and academic centers have funding priorities that include endowed chairs and professorships, new centers and programs, and the need for unrestricted funds that help me et the most urgent funding needs. Advancement officers work with the deans and directors to create development plans to increase college and school fundraising. Figure 8 : Advancement Giving Summary Donor Category IV: Criterion Two Facilities Resources Saint Louis University continues to seize upon emergent opportunities for creating an infrastructure that supports and integrates its mission to support research, education, and commitment to the neighboring Saint Louis metropolitan community. As the following examples illustrate , the University has evidenced an ongoing commitment to the acquisition of property and development of physic al space in recognition of currently identified needs and to allow itself planning flexibility for as yet undetermined future needs. Commitment to the Development of Grand Center Saint Louis University's mission and location as an urban campus compel us to extend our support beyond our campus borders. In the ten years since HLC's last campus visit, SLU has actively partnered with the leadership of the Grand Center Arts District , which is directly adjacent to the University, to carry out the shared vis ion of revitalizing the Midtown arts district that, in turn, contributes to an increasingly vibrant downtown St. Louis community. An article in the spring 2003 issue of Universitas , SLU's alumni magazine, details some of the prominent contributions made by the University to preserve, enhance, and develop this local gem (see pp.8 -13). The rescue of the Continental Life Bui lding is a highly visible example (SLU provided crucial financing). Another is Hotel Ignacio , a boutique hotel developed in partnership with the Lawrence Group and opened in 2011. Less visible, but equally important to community stabilization is Hometown SLU, a forgivable loan program that encourages SLU employees to live in areas neighboring campus by providing financial assistance with home purchases. SLU's many contributions are publicly recognized, both informally and formally, through celebrations of the University President's influence in transforming the Midtown area. Among the most notabl e: The St. Louis Post -Dispatch named the University President its St. Louis Citizen of the Year for 2005, in recognition of his leadership on SLU's behalf. In 2006, the President was honored by the St. Louis Business Journal as a \"legend\" \u2014someone who has \"gone beyond being influential to become legends in our region and beyond.\" In 2011, the American Jewish Committee of St. Louis selected the Presiden t to receive its John D. Levy Human Relations Award, which recognize leaders \"who have applied their leadership, creativity and commitment to service, to make St. Louis a better place.\" SLU donor responses to the question, \"Why d o you give?\" \"...because the fellowship program was a gift to me, and a wonderful time of my life.\" \"...because SLU is an outstanding Jesuit school preparing the whole person to lead a full and rewarding life.\" \"...because SLU gave me a fantastic career in s ocial work, as well as many great friends and memories.\" \"...because of the quality faculty.\" \"...because I was helped by grants and I want others to be helped by my gift.\" 72 Chapter IV: Criterion Two Commitment to the Development of the Saint Louis Campus The Saint Lou is campus continues to enrich its presence as an anchor to stability in the Midtown area. SLU is dedicated to providing the ideal environment, inside and out, promoting teaching, learning, and research study. Since the last HLC accreditation in 2002, on average $36.1 M annually has been invested to support the construction of new facilities and the renovation of existing buildings, including the enhancement of research and clinical space, implementation of new programs focusing on culture changes, performi ng technology upgrades, addressing enrollment growth, and improvements to University support spaces. The University recognizes that in addition to these investments, which are vital to the recruitment and retention of students, faculty, and staff, we must increase consideration toward capital renewal. More specifically, the University must keep current with the immediate demands of its aging buildings and existing facilities. Current progress includes the development and implementation of a comprehensive building and infrastructure condition assessment, which will subsequently feed into an asset management b udgeting plan. Doisy Research Cente r In December 2007 , Saint Louis University marked a new era in biomedical research, with the dedication of its most significant building project, the new Edward A. Doisy Research Center (DRC). The building has made a profound impact on the Medical Center by creating an environment that stimulates and elevates both learning and discovery. The facility forms the east ern anchor of CORTEX (the Center of Research Technology and Entrepreneurial Exchange), an initiative to develop a nationally recognized life -sciences industry in the corridor between Washington University in St. Louis and Saint Louis University. At $82 M, the DRC is the largest construction project in the history of the University. The highly -secured 10 - story, 206,000 square foot facility is populated with a vivarium, research clinic, and 80 research labs designed with flexibility in mind. Many labs are open so the 162 scientists from complementary fields can share knowledge as they work on experiments. Researchers are working in five key areas: cancer, liver disease, heart/lung disease, aging and brain disease, and vaccine development. The structure wa s also built with an eye to environmentalism . Because of the cutting edge activities taking place in the building, the University thought it only fitting to adopt sustainable construction methods. The Edward A. Doisy Research Center is certified by the U .S. Green Building Council as a LEED building. Significant Laboratory Space Renovations and Equipment Replacement Following the completion of the DRC, the School of Medicine (Caroline, Schwitalla and Doisy Halls) received a $4.7 M makeover. The project wa s a multi -year undertaking, broken into three phases, wrapping up in spring 2011. The project focus addressed ag ing conditions of 219 labs and support spaces, just over one - third of the 337,000+ square foot complex. The buildings, while constructed separa tely, share common walls and corridors, as well as electrical and mechanical systems, many of which fell short of current standards for biomedical research. The scope of work addressed infrastructure upgrades, which included mechanical, electrical, plumbi ng, data connectivity, case work , and new finishes. Macelwane Hall and Monsanto Hall have undergone extensive renovations during the decade. They now support over 650 biology, biochemistry, chemistry, and earth & atmospheric sciences majors, 1,960 additi onal undergraduate majors from the Doisy College of Health Sciences and Parks College, and approximately 4,800 undergrad uates taking courses to meet their core science requirements. In fall 200 6, Macelwane Hall underwent a $5.1 M renovation project to add ress the continued growth in the University's student body and the demands put on the requisite number of science lab slots for students. The project was made possible by relocating approximately 12,000 square feet of Department of Earth & Atmospheric Sci ences faculty and administrative offices to O'Neil Hall as their new permanent home. New spaces created under this project included five teaching laboratories for the Department of Biology, an instructional teaching laboratory and eight research and prep labs, as well as four offices, and two supply storage areas and two new women's restrooms. 73 Chapter IV: Criterion Two Like the programs in Macelwane Hall, Monsanto Hall also began to outgrow space needs for chemistry and biochemistry. In an effort to sustain the Department of Che mistry's strong upward trajectory in research and research training, $1.2 M was spent on building upgrades. The work, scheduled to be completed in April of 2012, is performed to enhance infrastructure upgrade primarily focusing on research space to allow researchers and their students to conduct experiments in a stable setting. The project addresses improvements in environmental conditions by installing mechanical controls equipment, proper pipe insulation, roof replacement, new windows, and new finishes. Other notable projects conducted over the past 10 years included the 1,500 square foot Sleep Study Center for the advancement of sleep behavior. Work included the build -out of five climate control bedrooms, a control monitor room, observation area, laund ry room, kitchenette, and storage space. This project was completed in December 2007 for the cost of $354,508. In summer 2011, Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology completed modest renovations in McDonnell Douglas Hall to accommodate th e new civil engineering program. The program is outfitted with a concrete lab, beam structural testing lab, hydraulic lab, soil mechanics lab, and an environmental lab. Global Citizenship Center Recognizing that the future of education is one that prepar es students not only to compete in a global economy but to be conscientious citizens of our world, Saint Louis University established a new Center for Global Citizenship in 2011. Rather than isolating international students studying at Saint Louis Univers ity, this center combines services for domestic and international students, faculty , and staff including English as a Second Language (ESL), visa support, study abroad programs, and our new host family program. Moreover, the English writing labs for stude nts enrolled in English 150: The Process of Composition and English 190: Advanced Strategies of Rhetoric and Research are housed in this building in 360 -degree learning stud ios featuring flexible furniture configuration, multiple collaborative writing sur faces, and technology that supports the projection of student work for class discussion. In this way, a large number of SLU's domestic students are exposed to the Center and its activities. School of Law Re location Although the School of Law had for several years been planning an a mbitious , $35M expansion and renovation of the current School of Law building, spring 2010 brought to the University community news of a major gift: the donation of an 11 -story, 260,000 -square foot downtown building that wi ll become the School of Law's new home in Fall 2013. The gift, from benefactors Joe and Loretta Scott, enables the School to be located next door to the civil courts and within walking distance of the Thomas F. Eagleton U.S. Courthouse, as well as many of the region's most prestigious law firms. The model of off -campus law schools is found at many of the nation's finest universities, including Boston College, Fordham University, and Georgetown University. Madrid Campus In 2005, recognizing the need for additional educational space to support Madrid faculty and students, campus leadership successfully negotiated the rental of an additional campus facility , which it named Manresa Hall. However, it proved to be suited only for temporary use . Accordingly, in 2011, SLU initiated the purchase of the building to be known as San Ignacio Hall , scheduled to open in July 2012 following renovations. Use of all other rental space \u2014including the current location of the campus library and dining services, Loyola Hall\u2014will be discontinued as the new acquisition will increase usable indoor space for classrooms, offices, performing arts studios, dining facilities, and the library by 40%. 74 Chapter IV: Criterion Two New Medical Center Facilities The Health Sciences Education Union , opened in July 2011, is designed to bring together the educational and social dimensions of students' lives. The building includes a 225 -seat auditorium with a 25 -panel high definiti on video screen to be used for both academic and co -curricular presentations; a clinical facility containing eight state -of- the-art patient simulation labs; lounge space designed to bring students, faculty and staff together; a caf\u00e9; and office space for t he Interprofessional Education (IPE) Program . The inclusion of this academic program alongside the co - curricular aspect of this space demonstrates the desire to model the collaborative efforts in the health sciences inside and outside the classroom. In tandem with the construction of the Union, the University developed a nearby 11 -acre site as a Medical Center Stadium with bleacher seating for 600. With an NCAA -certified running tr ack surrounding an NCAA - regulation soccer field, the University's track and field teams finally can host home meets on campus. Further, this facility is expected to enhance student -athlete recruitment. Most important, however, the stadium provides a muc h needed and conveniently located outdoor recreational space for the many students, faculty, and staff at the Medical Center whose work and family commitments make it difficult for them to find time to travel to use the outdoor facilities on the northern e nd of campus. CTE Learning Studio and Innovative Teaching Fellowships Today's world is driven by rapidly changing technological innovations and global connectivity. The accelerating pace of change, in terms of technology, quantity of information, and the globalization of society, has led to challenges that are increasingly more complex in scope than those experienced by earlier generations. The pace of these changes requires Saint Louis University to design and construct facilities that can accommodate both today's and tomorrow's educational needs. In response to this opportunity, SLU's Reinert Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE) expanded its facilities and programming to assist faculty in creativel y addressing the educational needs of future generations of learners. Participating in the Herman Miller Learning Studio Research Project, the CTE opened a state -of-the-art teaching space called the Learning Studio in fall 2011. Designed by a team of fac ulty and students, this Des Peres Hall space incorporates flexible furniture with a range of innovative technologies and features. Supported by newly enhanced CTE assistance with instructional design, faculty using this space will experiment with new teac hing strategies that utilize the spatial and technological features of the facility to engage today's learners. The enrollment of classes using the Learning Studio will be capped at 25. \"I was thrilled to be one of the recipients of the Innovating Teaching Fellowships so that my students \u2014adult learners aged 22 -62\u2014could experience the new high - technology classroom. With the design of the furniture and classroom space, combined with the accessibility of tools like tablet computers and iPads, students were engaged and participative. ...With the classroom and support of our instructional designer, this course went from good to great! Currently, I am researching potential differences in academic performance and affective experiences for students in courses taught in the Learning Studio vs. online vs. in traditional classrooms.\" -- Stephanie Mooshegian, Assistant Professor, School for Professional Studies 75 Chapter IV: Criterion Two Faculty response to the availability of the Learning Studio has b een very positive. The CTE has inaugurated Innovative Teaching Fellowships, awarded on a competitive basis, to full -time faculty wishing to use the Learning Studio and (re)design a course to take full advantage of its capabilities. The disciplines repres ented by 2011 -2012 Fellows are athletic training, organizational studies, public health, history, French, and biology. Undergraduate Student Housing The changing nature of the undergraduate student population nationally is presenting a need to reconsider residential facilities for on -campus living . Our student \"customers\" are demanding more attractive, spacious living spaces with more amenities, private space, and community space. As the trend to continue to link the in- and out -of-classroom experiences for students becomes more prevalent, institutions like SLU also are confronted with the challenge of re -imagining residential space that promotes academic integration and support for academic su ccess. SLU's implementation of freshman and sophomore residency requirements in fall 2009 (freshmen) and fall 2010 (freshmen and sophomore s) also has presented concerns about the capacity of existing campus facilities to meet student demand, causing many students to move off campus during their junior and senior year. Staff in the Division of Student Development, aided by external consultants, conducted a feasibility study and presented housing recommendations to the Executive Staff Committee and Board o f Trustees in fall 2006. These recommendations included establishing a master -lease with a local facility to accommodate SLU's living space needs and solidify the expectations for beds; consideration of the impact of the then existing housing scholarships with the newly established freshman and sophomore residency requirements; determination of which new housing option would be most desirable and feasible (i.e., building new or buying and renovating an existing property); and evaluation of the status of t he Grand Forest apartments in light of new housing options. Eventual outcomes included the establishment of a master -lease with the Flats at Three Seven Four and shifting funding for housing scholarships to more genera lized financial packaging. Further, the decision was made not to move ahead with building new or renovating existing property to address housing needs. Given the current facility and capacity issues, the remaining residential housing challenges center ar ound SLU's ability to (1) compete in the college/university and local housing markets; and (2) continue to support its goals of integrating in - and out -of-class experiences and student learning in residential facilities. The 2011 MAP -Works survey of incom ing freshmen (80% return rate) demonstrated that SLU students rated lower in comparison with self -identified peer institutions, Carnegie classification peers, and all institutions on the factor The degree to which you are able to study in your room/hall. This indicator suggests the need for additional follow -up regarding the current residential campus experience, including how best to meet the current and emerging needs and desires of our students . Simon Recreation Center Just as the Student Government Association (SGA) has been instrumental in effecting future changes in the Pius Library facility, it also took a leadership role in the significant facility and service upgrades completed at the Simon Rec reation Center in 2007. This $8 million project, c ompleted in two phases, included a 39,000 square foot addition featuring over 200 new workout machines, a juice bar and lounge, more locker rooms, new multipurpose rooms, a full wellness suite, and a bouldering wall and gaming area. Renovations to the existing lobby, locker rooms, elevated track, and special event room, as well as the installation of an elevator, completed the overhaul. That students would want to have a state -of-the-art recreation center at their disposal for 114 hours per week is not un usual, but the fact that they voted to add a recreation fee to their University bill to pay for it is. And this wasn't the first time; students voted in 2001 to charge themselves an annual SLunion fee to help fund the $22 million renovation of the Bus ch Student Center, which was completed a year later. In each case, the students took these actions fully recognizing that many of them would graduate and leave the University before they could benefit personally from these new initiatives. 76 Chapter IV: Criterion Two Core Compo nent 2c The organization's ongoing evaluation and assessment processes provide reliable evidence of institutional effectiveness that clearly informs strategies for continuous improvement. There are key global markers of success and institutional effect iveness that are systemically reviewed and considered in the context of our University mission. However, while much of the ongoing evaluation and assessment is utilized at Saint Louis University to inform continuous program improvement, it often happens at the division or unit-level, as opposed to the institutional level. Often this data is directly connected with decision -making in a data -driven manner, but active assessment cycles that include a feedback loop for decision -making are not always present. There have been specific initiatives on campus that seek to establish performance dashboards, which make data related to strategic goals more readily accessible for key constituents includ ing the Board of Trustees and Executive Staff Committee. In estab lishing these dashboards of data points of relevance, it has been considered and discussed how to appropriately benchmark our data with our peer and aspirational institutions. As was discussed earlier, benchmarking is a required Operating Principle of bot h the newly - adopted University Strategic Plan and the the strategic plans to be developed at the division and unit levels throughout the institution. Specific examples of program improvement and decision -making linked with review of available data are out lined below. Ongoing Evaluation of Student Success and Retention Saint Louis University continuously monitors the progression rate of undergraduate students as measures of success, retention, and graduation. Retention of first -time, full -time, freshmen r eturning for their second semester and second year are both constant marker s of success for the traditional undergraduate population that are reviewed each semester at the institutional and college/school/center levels. Figure 9 details first-to- second ye ar retention rates, as well four- and six -year graduation rates , for cohorts of first -time, full -time students entering SLU in years 2000 -20110 . Specific University attention to matters of retention has been ongoing throughout the past decade . A previou sly existing Retention Management Committee, comprised of faculty and staff, was merged into a more clearly defined and charged Undergraduate Initiatives Committee that attended to issues of student success and retention, making specific recommendations fo r action to the Vice Presidents for Academic Affairs and Student Development. This committee provided an opportunity for integrated conversation and implemented intervention to promote student retention on campus. With the 2010 reorganization of the University's academic leadership and the shift to a more comprehensive Division of Enrollment and Retention Management, a strategic enrollment and retention group has gathered to formalize a campus -wide strategic planning effort around issues of enrollment an d retention to further analyze and utilize the available data for planning purposes. SLU also is committed to fostering students in their professional careers. According to the 2010 Graduate Survey, 95% of the graduates were satisfactorily occupied wit hin six months after graduation, either enrolled in graduate/professional school, employed, or unemployed but not seeking employment. Extensive data included in the Institutional Snapshot evidence the great success with which SLU students pass national licensure or certification exams tied to their academic programs. 77 Chapter IV: Criterion Two Figure 9 : Retention and Graduation Rates Fall Entered 2nd Year Retention Rate 4-Year Graduation Rate 6-Year Graduation Rate 86% Note: Students entering English as a Second Language, the School for Professional Studies, the School of Philosophy and Letters, a nd the Madrid, Spain campus are excluded above. Data -Driven Improvements in Selected Academic Units Quality assurance is at the foundation of program development in the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS). In addition to following all University guidelin es, the College has a systematic review of each program to insure each is intrinsically educational and economically viable. These assessments are used to inform College -wide strategic planning. The program assessment includes an internal and external co mponent. Results aid in determining resource and support needs or efficiencies; how well program goals are met; and success in terms of student achievement of learning outcomes. The College developed an Assessment Handbook to clearly articulate what asse ssment is, why it is critical, and a cycle for assessment that aligns findings with budget decisions. Assessment coordinators in each academic department facilitate this work. The John Cook School of Business has developed a comprehensive Assurance of Le arning Framework in support of a culture of continuous quality improvement. External market -based performance indicators (e.g., enrollments, placement of graduates, and starting salaries of graduates) are tracked. In addition, internal assessment functio ns are supported by an associate dean, staff, and student assistants, as well as an assessment team with faculty, student, and staff representation. Assurance of Learning is always included on the agendas of meetings of the faculty, the executive committee , and the curriculum boards of the school. Curriculum reviews are conducted regularly. In addition to personnel, financial support for assessment has averaged $20,000 per year for the past several years. Each program within the school is designed with t he University's Five Dimensions in mind, and has Assurance of Learning goals. Course objectives are mapped to these goals and evaluated with course -embedded assessments. The Cook School's Bachelor of Science in Business Administration program is evaluat ed with a number of tools, including course embedded assessments, externally conducted simulation exercises, and student surveys and analysis provided by Educational Benchmark Incorporated (EBI). In the early 2000s, EBI data indicated that freshmen and so phomores majoring in business did not feel connected to the Cook School. In response to this information, the Cook School launched a new course for freshman in fall 2006, BIZ 100. The course is required of all business majors, and provides new freshmen a n overview of the business curriculum in the 78 Chapter IV: Criterion Two context of a Jesuit university, an introduction to business foundations, and early mentoring . To date, student course evaluations and anecdotal evidence indicate broad satisfaction. It remains to be seen wheth er EBI survey outcomes improve in response to the course. Also in 2006, the Cook School of Business implemented a substantially revised full -time MBA program. The changes transformed the MBA from a traditional two -year cohort program to a one -year accele rated, cohort program. This radical revision was motivated by enrollments that fell short of expectations and subsequent research on accelerated programs. Evidence to date indicates that the new program is a success. Student enrollments have risen from 24 students in the Class of 2007 to 47 in the Class of 2011, close to the target maximum enrollment of 50 students. Student quality is up as well, from a mean GMAT of 549 and work experience of 30 months for the program's Class of 2007, to a mean GMAT of 578 and work experience of 45 months for the class admitted in 2010. Prior to the program's revision, the Cook School tracked program performance primarily with external market -based performance indicators. Today, while the school still closely tracks ma rket-based indicators (e.g., placement data), it also engages in a thorough internal assessment process. Among other tools, student learning and satisfaction are assessed using simulation exercises, reflection papers based in Ignatian pedagogy, town hall meetings with the cohort and the deans, regular assessment meetings of faculty who teach in the program, and with survey and analysis from EBI. This assessment program is designed to assure learning, continuous quality improvement, and the sustainability o f the program . Supporting Student Developmental Transitions Fall 2003 marked a campus -wide collaborative approach, led by the Vice Presidents for Academic Affairs and Student Development, to support the learning, success, and retention of undergraduate st udents through the development of comprehensive transition programs aligned with student developmental needs and stages. The discussion began with a campus -wide summit of faculty, staff , and students to engage in discussion about the First -Year Experience , reviewing national data and best practices and considering integration at Saint Louis University. This initial gathering was the beginning of a comprehensive First -Year Experience program, and the summit series later followed with several others surroun ding the First -Year Experience, Sophomore/Junior -Year Experience, and Senior -Year Experience, commencing in spring 2006 to discuss the comprehensive undergraduate experience at SLU. These discussions fostered a campus -wide buzz' around issues of succes s and retention for undergraduate students. Individual committees were established around these transition years to involve faculty, staff , and students. The committees regularly initiated research studies and analysis of existing campus data (in partner ship with the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs and the Office of Institutional Research) to inform the discussion about the SLU student experience. Based on the available data, recommendations were established and considered for implement ation on a campus -wide level. Specific campus programmatic changes that occurred as a result of this data -driven, campus -wide discussion include the establishment of the establishment of the First -Year Experience, Sophomore/Junior -Year Experience, and Sen ior-Year Experience developmental co -curricular programs, the Integrated Advising and Mentoring System, the Senior Legacy Symposium, and numerous other program improvements or adjustments that supported student learning and retention either as a whole, or for specifically identified at -risk student populations. Aligning Resources to Assessment Efforts The Office of Institutional Research (OIR) was expanded in July 2011 to enhance the unit's capacity for and ability to conduct more detailed academic program reviews, as well as in -depth market research to inform recruitment, retention, and new program development planning. The overall focus of the OIR operation is evolving from a strong emphasis on institutional reporting (for state/federal compliance, U.S. News , etc.) to a strong emphasis on primary and secondary research to inform academic and enrollment management decision -making. This work will be aided by the addition of two resources: the Qualtrics survey tool and Activity Insight. 79 Chapter IV: Criterion Two The University's de cision in 2010 to adopt, fund, promote, and support the use of a single e -survey tool (Qualtrics) evidences a commitment to quality and consistency in administrative data collection informing strategic decision -making. This initiative also mandates greate r support for training in the methodological design and conduct of Qualtrics -based surveys; hence, the University has begun discussing ways to best foster excellence in survey research across the institution. Over the past two years, a significant investm ent of human resources has been dedicated to the development of an institution -wide database in which records of all faculty scholarly activity \u2014teaching, research and service \u2014can be collected, and from which the data can be reported by multiple users at va rious levels to inform strategic decision -making. The tool selected for this purpose is Activity Insight, which previously had been piloted in the John Cook School of Business in support of its accreditation efforts. The effort to implement Activity Insi ght throughout SLU has been slow, and welcomed with both enthusiasm and reservation in various circles. The collection of all such data in a single, searchable database affords users access to information in a relatively uniform format across all academic units, enabling comparative analysis that is deemed by many to be critically important for internal research and benchmarking efforts yet deemed by others to fail to adequately account for disciplinary differences. The database was employed extensively i n the fall 2011 review of productivity of the faculty of the College of Education and Public Service. By spring 2012, all academic units will have been requested to use the Activity Insight database to produce reports informing annual faculty performance reviews. Underutilized Campus -Wide Data While Saint Louis University at the institutional level often collects data and facilitates assessment efforts, the data is not always readily disseminated, and the findings are not always directly connected with decision - making. For example, SLU's Office of Institutional Research (OIR) receives the summary comparative performance data from each administration of the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) and directs NSSE to provide that data sorted by vari ous student sub -populations (e.g., college/school, major, gender, race). Because of competing priorities, however, those results are not routinely shared throughout the University. OIR staff do not regularly create such reports, instead providing the da ta to departments, colleges, and schools upon request. Further, there are no annual reporting mechanisms through which to provide such data. Regular creation and dissemination of reports on NSSE data \u2014along with guidance about how to use the data \u2014would be extremely helpful to all, and would intentionally push key information out to faculty and staff, instead of waiting for their requests. Getting that data regularly would aid faculty and staff in their own strategic planning, assessment work, and annua l reporting. Surveys of the Student Educational Experience The Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs has conducted a series of surveys of the educational experiences of undergraduate students. Regular surveys of new freshmen, graduating sen iors, and alumni have provided insight about the University's core curricula, in particular, as well as the extent to which undergraduate students developed in the context of The Five Dimensions of the SLU Experience . Use of the results of such surveys, h owever, has not been regularly assessed. Like many institutions, SLU does a better job of collecting good data than ensuring that that data drives decision -making. However, the lack of a single core curricula, and the limits of the Five Dimensions as ov erarching University -wide student learning outcomes, have rendered the data from many of those institution -wide surveys to be limited, as well. Fortunately , assessment efforts have shifted to advancing discussions of establishing measurable institution -wide outcomes that, when assessed, will yield more actionable data. 80 Chapter IV: Criterion Two Core Component 2d All levels of planning align with the organization's mission, thereby enhancing its capacity to fulfill that mission. The University mission, history, and her itage intentionally and regularly inform SLU's decision -making. Planning and allocation of resources clearly align with the University's mission . While the process of planning is decentralized, the ability to approve and implement those plans remains cen tralized. University leaders clearly expect that all programs/services offered align with mission, but do not always articulate definitions or indicators of what excellence is or should be at various levels. T he implementation of the FY2013 -2017 Univer sity Strategic Plan should provide significant direction to units across the institution , and more tightly align planning throughout . Research Over the past 10 years, SLU has made a significant investment in its research programs that has allowed the St. Louis campus to advance its commitment to developing new and innovative knowledge and products. A strategic plan for research has been developed and resulted in several effective initiatives designed to maintain and promote the research mission of the U niversity. To facilitate the University's future research endeavors and reflect its commitment to the importance of research at SLU, the position of associate vice president for research was elevated to vice president in early 2010. As was the case even in the position's previous form, the Vice President for Research oversees all of the University's research initiatives and works closely with governmental agencies, private industry, and other educational and research institutes to enhance SLU's research p rograms. Now, however, this official is a member of the Executive Staff Committee, the President's Coordinating Council (PCC), and the Council of Academic Deans and Directors (CADD), ensuring access to and collaboration with other senior -level University administrators, as well as improved coordination and dialogue with high -level academic administrators. Support for the Integration of Mission One of the ways the University's mission is implemented is by allocating resources to departments that enable them to create their own department vision that aligns with the mission of the University. For example, in the College of Arts and Sciences, funding has been provided over the past few years to build up departments like Philosophy and Theological Studies. Significant increases in starting salaries and start -up funds have helped attract top scholars to SLU in these departments , which contribute to the departments' ability to provide excellence in the Jesuit tradition. Administrative Structures and Planning In September 2009, the University President announced a reorganization of SLU's academic administration. In particular, the Office of the Provost was eliminated and replaced with two vice president positions, one on the Frost campus and another on the Health Sciences campus. Prior to the reorganization, in terms of the University's organizational chart, the Provost, as the sole chief academic officer of the University, was ranked second to the President. With the reorganization, the two new vic e presidents, chief academic officers of their respective campuses, held equivalent rank with ten other vice presidents who govern aspects of the University's operations such as facilities, human resources, student development, mission and ministry, and research. The reorganization was not without controversy. In October 2009, the Faculty Senate unanimously approved a resolution requesting that the decision to abolish the Office of the Provost be suspended until the faculty could be consulted. Following the Faculty Senate's request, the President agreed to put further action regarding the reorganization on hold. A Senate task force was formed to review the reorganization proposal. In addition, a document providing a rationale for the reorganization was offered to the faculty by the administration. By February 2010, after consultation with the faculty and after adoption of several revisions supported by th e Faculty 81 Chapter IV: Criterion Two Senate (principally the responsibilities and reporting lines associated with the newly restructured vice presidential positions ), the reorganization announced by the President in September 2009 was implemented. This reorganization is one example of SLU being able to make significant changes and adapt to new conditions quickly. It also evidenced associated challenges, particularly in terms of communication with all potential stakeholders. Full implementation of the FY2013 -2017 University Strateg ic Plan will help ensure such communication , and provide structures for decision -making that is trans parent and collaborative. Since the reorganization, efforts on the part of the administration to address both issues of transparency and collaboration ha ve been apparent. The current Vice President for Academic Affairs has engaged the University community in conversations on a number of important issues, including strategic planning, characteristics of Jesuit education, faculty evaluation, and institution al benchmarking. The FY2013 -2017 University Strategic Plan mandates alignment of strategic planning efforts throughout the institution, and takes the assessment of institutionally -aligned initiatives down to the individual employ ee level. This is intend ed to develop throughout the SLU community a clear sense of how a particular employee's performance contributes to the University's strategic intentions and directions. Magis : Recommendations Saint Louis University's financial strength allows f or programmatic and funding flexibility that, even amid turbulent financial times, enhances the University's ability to achieve its mission -grounded goals. Sometimes this provides opportunities at the institutional level, but frequently implementation is at lower, unit levels. While this culture of decentralized innovation promotes excellence, a challenge it presents is the need for consistent, centralized strategic planning structures. Successfully implementing a more consistent, integrated, and transpar ent strategic plan and planning process \u2014employed throughout the University \u2014would increase efficient use of human and fiscal resources, help all constituents better understand and take ownership of University priorities, and enable SLU to accomplish even mo re. Recommendations include: Recommendation Strategic Plan Integration Ensure that budget priorities and resource allocation are grounded in University Strategic Planning. Strategic Direction A: Improve Academic and Research Performance and Reputatio n Strategic Direction B: Utilize Prudent Fiscal Management Critical Success Factor 1: Academic and Research Index Critical Success Factor 2: Financial Strength Index Develop a comprehensive, long -term and University -wide plan to maintain and advance campus infrastructure; regularly update and share the plan throughout the SLU community. Strategic Direction D: Continue Campus and Community Development Critical Success Factor 4: Campus Infrastructure and Environment Index Implement a comprehensive commun ication plan for the dissemination and strategic utilization of University -wide assessment information (e.g., NSSE results) Strategic Direction A: Improve Academic and Research Performance and Reputation Critical Success Factor 1: Academic and Research In dex 82 Chapter IV: Criterion Two Decision -making throughout the University is increasingly data -driven. However, using data to close the assessment loop and properly evaluate the impact of those decision, remains a challenge. Related recommendations include: Recommendation Strategic Plan Integration Structurally integrate implementation of the 2013-2017 Strategic Plan across policies, procedures and practices University -wide; ensure that faculty, staff and students meaningfully contribute at all appropriate levels; document a nd regularly communicate with all constituents progress toward the collaboratively - established, measurable performance goals at all levels. Operating Principle 5: Communication Regularly assess University -wide strategic planning efforts. Determine consi stent, systematic reporting expectations and processes to be utilized across the institution at various levels. Operating Principle 2: Goal Setting Operating Principle 3: Accountability, Evaluation and Reward Systems Clarify and communicate University -wide expectations regarding assessment, identifying and appropriately supporting assessment -related resources to assist academic and administrative units. Operating Principle 5: Communication Chapter V Criterion Three: Student Learning and Ef fective Teaching The organization provides evidence of student learning and teaching effectiveness that demonstrates it is fulfilling its educational mission. 84 Chapter V: Criterion Three Chapter V: Criterion Three Core Component 3a The organization's goals f or student learning outcomes are clearly stated for each educational program and make effective assessment possible. The Five Dimensions of the SLU Experience The Five Dimensions of the Saint Louis University Experience were derived from SLU's mission an d articulate the University's conception of holistic student formation rooted in our Jesuit heritage. The Five Dimensions are those facets of human development in which all student s\u2014undergraduate and graduate \u2014are expected to grow throughout their time at SLU, and for which faculty and staff develop educational programming. They are as follows: Scholarship and Knowledge By developing well -rounded educational foundations which incorporate learning through experience, by becoming scholars in their chosen fi elds, and by dedicating themselves to the advancement of knowledge, students prepare for advance study, for their careers, and for lifelong learning. Intellectual Inquiry and Communication By developing the abilities of intellectual inquiry and communicat ion, students are able to learn effectively, express ideas and concepts clearly, and apply their knowledge in new situations and contexts. Community Building By welcoming and working with others, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or gender, students build an inclusive community which leads to respect and compassion for human life and the dignity of each person. Leadership and Service By serving others and by promoting social justice, students can become men and women for others who lead by their exa mple. Spirituality and Values By developing their spirituality, values, and openness to the transcendent, students are able to determine principles to guide their actions and their relationships with others. The Five Dimensions were adopted to present a manageable framework via which academic and co -curricular educational programs were to align existing outcomes and to develop additional appropriate and measurable students outcomes. They were adopted in part as a response to the call from HLC (in its report on SLU's 2002 continued accreditation efforts ) for a 2005 Progress Report on University -wide academic assessment. As a conceptual educational framework, The Five Dimensions are descriptions of the categories of learning and development in which ind ividual academic and co -curricular units establish and assess student progress toward measurable outcomes of performance. Nearly 10 years after the adoption of The Five Dimensions , they have been both successful and challenging. As evidenced in annual d epartmental program reviews and assessments, external accreditation reports, and 85 Chapter V: Criterion Three college/school annual reports to the Vice President for Academic Affairs , individual departments and colleges/schools have, for the most part, successfully aligned their unit goals, outcomes , and overall assessment plans with one or more of the dimens ions. Units generally support The Five Dimensions as appropriately descriptive of the educational contexts in which they and their students regularly work (although graduate/profe ssional units, c ollectively, have not embraced The Five Dimensions as enthusiastically as have primarily undergraduate units ). Faculty and staff generally recognize and earnestly resonate with the University's mission -driven commitment to student developm ent in all f ive dimensions. At the course and program levels, however, there are several challenges presented by The Five Dimensions . First, individual faculty members, chairs, program directors and others often attempt to develop course - or program -specific measurable goals that align with all five of the dimensions. That they s truggle to do so is understandable , as no single academic or co -curricular program could or should necessarily be responsible for the development of students in all five of the dimensions. However, communication over the years has sometimes either implied or stated that all programs \u2014particularly academic programs \u2014do, in fact, need to address, in some way, all five dimensions. Over time, the impracticality of such direction has be come evident. A second struggle with The Five Dimensions is that, although the very broadly -stated dimensions were not intended to be employed as specific course - or program -level learni ng outcomes themselves, many faculty and staff nonethel ess attempt \u2014again, with limited success \u2014to assess student learning and development directly against the very general goal statements within one or more dimension s. The Five Dimensions have posed additional challenges for assessment at the institutional level. First, although they were designed to replace an unwieldy set of 23 Saint Louis University Student Learning Outcomes, The Five Dimensions still include, in the aforementioned goal statements in the explanatory text, revised versions of most of th ose 23 outcomes. In other words, because each of The Five Dimensions still includes several broadly - stated University -wide learning goals, functionally The Five Dimensions are nearly as far -reaching and unwieldy as their predecessors. Additionally, s tudent development toward the very general, broadly -stated goals associated with each dimension has proven difficult to assess. Several distinct but related student -response surveys, administered regularly in the past five to seven years, have produced a significant amount of data regarding current students' and alumni self -responses to questions about their ability to do various tasks related to the goals of each dimension. For example, on the 2008 Graduating Senior Survey , senior -level students were a sked to Rate [their] ability to...apply knowledge from the humanities (for example, History, English, Fine & Performing Arts, Languages, Philosophy, Theology). That question was intended to discern the extent to which students were meeting the University -wide goal of developing a well -rounded educational foundation embedded in the Scholarship and Knowledge Dimension. However, there is no evidence that students understand what apply knowledge from the humanities means, nor is there evidence that whatev er that understanding might be is necessarily a reflection of having developed a well -rounded educational foundation. Accordingly, there is also no evidence that the results of this survey have been fruitfully employed to close the assessment loop an d inform improvement. In the Survey of Students' Perceptions of the Core Experience , the Graduating Senior Survey , and the Undergraduate and Graduate Alumni Survey (each of which has been administered several times in the past few years), similar quest ions\u2014specifically asking about knowledge or behavioral development not directly specified in the formal articulation of the Five Dimensions \u2014abound; in turn, they have been of limited use in effecting substantive change . Also important to address are t he very real programmatic differences evidenced between graduate -level and undergraduate -level educational programs. For example, under the Scholarship and Knowledge Dimension is the following text : By developing well -rounded educational foundations...stu dents prepare for advanced study... Such a statement certainly invokes visions of a liberal arts core and undergraduate study, but does 86 Chapter V: Criterion Three not characterize most conceptions of graduate study. The explanatory text under the Spirituality and Values Dimension r eferences developing [students'] spirituality, values, and openness to the transcendent. That statement seems appropriate for the undergraduate level, at which all students are, minimally, required to take one to three theology courses and one to three p hilosophy courses as part of their core curricula. But at the graduate level, no such requirements exist. Assessment of Core Curricula Frequently invoked in relation to The Five Dimensions are the undergraduate core curricula of SLU's colleges and scho ols. Each college/school requires students to complete academic requirements deemed to be central to SLU's Jesuit educational experience for all of its students. Because there is not a single, University -wide core curriculum, assessment of core experienc es and outcomes is the responsibility of each college/school, and they fulfill that responsibility in various ways, and with varying levels of success. For example, the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) has clearly articulated and well -published student learning outcomes for its core curriculum. Those goals and related requirements are reviewed regularly and changed as needed, e.g., in 2010 the College revised its goals and outcomes regarding cultural awareness . CAS' core curriculum is also reviewed via other, University -wide assessments. For example, the minutes of the College's April 2009 Faculty Council meeting indicate that its Core Curriculum Subcommittee had reviewed and discussed the results of the rece nt University -wide student survey of the core curriculum \u2014but that no action followed from there. So for some units the next steps in developing their assessment programs is the follow -through to use collected data for significant programmatic and/or pedag ogical improvements. Other units are hampered by core student learning outcomes that are not well -defined, not understood by all unit faculty and students, and/or not expressed in terms of specific targets against which student performance can be assessed . In short, the planning and assessment challenges posed by both ( 1) the variability of core curriculum outcomes across units and ( 2) The Five Dimensions now warrant the establishment of clearly stated, measurable, institution -wide student learning outco mes for all undergraduate students. Once such outcomes are established and adopted by all units, faculty and academic leaders can move to assess student achievement across programs utilizing a common evaluative rubric. We can then refine the design and i mplementation of curricular and co -curricular programs as needed, to ensure student achievement of the University -wide learning outcomes. Indeed, that process has already begun. Throughout the 2010 -2011 academic year, early strategic planning efforts evidenced the need for SLU to clearly define its institutional educational identity, grounded in its Jesuit heritage, so that SLU educational programs could be refined and designed according to that shared identity. As a result, the Vice President for Aca demic Affairs commissioned a task force, chaired by the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, to develop a document articulating the Features Characteristic of Graduates of Saint Louis University . In fall 2011, the task force completed its work, offeri ng the following such features: Deep understanding that faith can be integrated with reason and science According to the institutional ethos, rational bases can be offered for faith and ethical life, and the poles of faith and reason and the divine and the human exist in productive tension. Students are trained to think carefully, courageously, with openness to the transcendent and a commitment to social justice. They are educated to become reflective about themselves, the deeper presuppositions at work in the disciplines they pursue, and the presence of God in the work they do \u2014fully in line with the spirit of the early Jesuits. Mastery of cutting -edge disciplinary knowledge situated within a broader appreciation of the many dimensions of knowledge Schol ars in all disciplines enjoy the freedom to pursue truth according to the dictates of their fields, which are of value in themselves, as the early Jesuits believed, and rigorous and innovative thinking is prized throughout the University. Students should a ttain the depth of comprehension required to 87 Chapter V: Criterion Three seek new knowledge, the breadth needed to understand complexity and change, and the skills to meet the highest professional standards. Enduring engagement with the world and an educated desire to seek justice Students are prepared to plunge into the heart of the world and to understand the complex factors underlying injustices at the local, national, and international levels. Because of the University's location in the city of Saint Louis, this commitment to just ice is embedded in important ways in the local community and addresses the immediate challenges of that community, all the while recognizing how global challenges affect the community and the lives of everyone, just as the early Jesuits were constantly awa re of the global context framing their endeavors. Students are readied to become competent, socially -responsible citizens of their community, their country, and the world. Commitment to service fueled by faith and by solidarity with those less fortunate Saint Louis University students daily explore the relationship between love of God and love of neighbor and have experience serving their fellow human beings and seeking justice with and for them. They are inclined to place their knowledge, talents , and skil ls at the service of others, such as those who do not have access to higher education as they do. Respect for difference and diversity Saint Louis University students are open to and respectful of people whose opinions, personal or social characteristics, religious beliefs and values differ from their own. They act with the confidence of the original Jesuits, demonstrated by Ricci in China, that God is to be found in all places, persons, and cultures. They are also are cognizant of the impact of social and economic institutions on society's most vulnerable people. These features echo \u2014in some cases, very clearly \u2014The Five Dimensions . That relationship forms a conceptual foundation on which SLU has based efforts in spring 2012 to begin to define a shared set of University -wide undergraduate learning outcomes. In January 2012, a team of faculty and staff attended the Annual Meeting of the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) with the express ed purpose of seeking assistance in developing t hese goals, and learning more about successful core/general education assessment methods. Later this spring, a small group of faculty and staff will author an initial draft of institution -wide outcomes based on (1) The Five Dimensions , (2) the Features Ch aracteristic of Graduates of Saint Louis University , and (3) the AAC&U's Liberal Education and America's Promise (LEAP) project, a highly -respected national initiative to establish standards and expectations for liberal education in the 21st century. Facu lty and academic leaders University -wide will then be called upon to review, revise , and approve the goals ultimately adopted. The establishment of those goals will quickly facilitate far more effective assessment of core curricula and student learning th an is currently possible; it will also support and advance rigorous assessment of major programs and co -curricular programs/services than is currently possible. Program -Level Learning Outcomes and Assessment: Accredited Programs Saint Louis Uni versity offers a combination of undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs, each of which addresses assessment of learning outcomes and effective teaching in different ways. The University has a varied assessment history, often dependent on the pr esence or absence of particular disciplinary accreditation. Nearly every SLU program that could possibly seek external, program -level accreditation does so as a matter of principle. SLU faculty greatly value the peer review at the heart of such accredi tation work, and they value as well the national and international recognition of quality that such accreditation often affords. As part of SLU's new program proposal process, as well as the process to review existing programs, faculty and academic leader s are asked about the existence of related accreditation and to discuss their rationale for seeking accreditation; that rationale supports requests for funding or other resources required for accreditation. 88 Chapter V: Criterion Three SLU programs that are accredited by external entities have well -established learning goals supported by assessment data that is regularly analyzed and used in making curricular decisions. However, the impetus for the development of those outcomes generally extends beyond the requirements of outside disciplinary accrediting bodies. In establishing their educational outcomes, many accredited units also incorporate distinctive elements of institutional mission, resulting in outcomes that either exceed in number those required by external accreditors, or that exceed those requirements in their scope through their alignment with The Five Dimensions . For example, programs within the School of Medicine, School of Public Health, School of Nursing, Doisy College of Health Sciences, and School of Social Work a ll share educational outcomes articulated as part of the Interprofessional Education (IPE) Program, which go well beyond the requirements and expectations of their respective program accrediting bodies to address outcomes distinctively tied to SLU's Catholic, Jesuit heritage and mission. These outcomes include: Interprofessional Practice: A collaborative, interdependent use of shared expertise directed toward a unified delivery of o ptimal patient care. This includes understanding the roles, responsibilities, and scope of practice of various health professions, and skills at collaborative decision making and team - based communication. Integrated, Patient Centered Care: The development of attitudes and communication skills that support patient empowerment and inclusion in care planning, while demonstrating sensitivity to autonomy, culture, language, literacy, socioeconomic conditions and patient comfort. Additionally, the integration of evidence based practice, informatics, self -management support, and care coordination as outlined in a Patient Centered Medical Home. Wellness: The integration of evidence -based prevention guidelines and development of patient education skills enabling a system change from sick -care to wellness and prevention. Additionally, an understanding of an ecological model for determinants of health and program components that support community/population health . Patient Safety and Quality Care: The ability to de monstrate personal and systems quality improvement processes and communication skills across professions that lead to a reduced risk and improved quality of care. Social Justice: Recognize one's responsibility to act for the good of others and apply knowl edge and skills in helping the most vulnerable. This includes understanding and working to eliminate health disparities, and developing skills for advocacy, policy change, and community development . Another example is provided by the John Cook School of B usiness (JCSB), which is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). Programs within the Cook School of Business are all geared toward student achievement of educational outcomes that many other AACSB - accredited school s may not include based on their own missions . For instance, Cook Master of Business Administration (MBA) students are expected to achieve the following outcomes , which are aligned with several of SLU's Five Dimensions : Dimension: Leadership and Servi ce Service to others and the promotion of social justice in order to become men and women for others who lead by example. o MBA Learning Outcome: Students are encouraged to participate in at least one service learning experience during the course of their studies and/or participate and assume leadership roles in student and community organizations. o Method of Assessment : Full-time MBA students, who are required to complete a service learning experience, will upload a reflection paper on Moodle for review. Pa rt-time MBA students will be surveyed to document participation in service and/or leadership roles and what they have learned from them. 89 Chapter V: Criterion Three Dimension: Spirituality and Values By developing their values, and openness to the transcendent, students determine principles to guide their actions and their relationships with others. Learning Outcome: o MBA Learning Outcome: Student are exposed to values issues and application of values to business professions in case analyses and in classroom interaction. o Method of Assessment: MBA student will upload a reflection paper on Moodle as part of their Ethics course or course modules. The paper would be reviewed. As is addressed under Core Component 4c, there are some accredited programs that are not required by their accreditors to address educational outcomes outside the scope of the more narrowly -defined major. As a matter of practice at SLU, accredited programs have not been required to participate in the otherwise mandated program review process, meaning that some acc redited units have still more progress to be made in terms of their overall assessment efforts. A revised Program Review Policy, being developed in Spring 2012, will require participation of all academic units and programs, regardless of external accredit ation status. Program -Level Learning Outcomes and Assessment: Non -Accredited Programs Most SLU programs without any specialized accreditation also have articu lated student learning outcomes . The University as a whole is building on its strengths and continues to develop a culture of assessment across all its academic units as evidenced by the number of departments that have enhanced their assessment process since the 2002 HLC accreditation visit. Although there has been increased assessment activity, particularly from 2007 and forward, these activities have not always been well publicized , which make the activities less transparent and less accessible to external parties . However, a new, institution -wide website is under development in the Office of the V ice President for Academic Affairs that will be devoted to cataloging and publicizing (for internal and external audiences) student learning outcomes assessment plans and results University -wide. One unit evidencing significant growth in the quality and quantity of program -level assessment work is the College of Arts and Sciences . Overall, it is fair to assert that \u2014as is the case at many colleges and universities \u2014the more traditionally -regarded arts and sciences disciplines have not led the assessmen t charge at SLU. However, there are notable exceptions to that generalization, foremost of which is the Department of Theological Studies. Assisted by a $70,000 grant from the Wabash Center for Teaching and Learning in Theology and Religion for their pro ject, Assessment as Proactive Pedagogy , departmental faculty spent three years committed to (1) developing clear assessment rubrics that make the reciprocity between learning outcomes and teaching methods more visible and practical; and (2) advancing a dep artmental culture of assessment through critical, creative, careful, and collaborative reflection about the practices of teaching and learning. Those activities were guided by three fundamental questions: Why do faculty do what they do? What are they do ing? And how do they know they are doing it? Among numerous positive outcomes was the development of a standard syllabus and pre-/post -test ass essment system for the THEO 100 Theological Foundations: Discovery course, taken by all SLU undergraduates as p art of their core curricula. As a result of this expansive assessment project, Theological Studies faculty are now regular contributors to assessment programs offered by the Center for Teaching Excellence and are otherwise sought after as assessment mento rs to others in and outside of the College. Complementing the exemplary work of units like the Department of Theological Studies are departments throughout the College of Arts and Sciences that have more slowly, but surely, advanced their own department al and programmatic cultures of assessment. Data gathered as part of the CAS' 2010 -2011 departmental assessment audit evidence significant strides across departments. That now annual audit requires units to provide responses to the following prompts: 1. List your department's/program's objectives. (These are statements about what students should learn, understand, or appreciate as a result of their studies. They identify the content or learning parameters of your program of study.) 90 Chapter V: Criterion Three 2. List your program's lea rning outcomes. (These are statements that identify what students should be able to demonstrate, represent, or produce . These statements translate learning into actions, behaviors, or other products that others can look at to infer something about the br eadth and depth of student learning.) 3. Which outcomes listed above were assessed this year? 4. Please describe your assessment method or assessment tool used to assess the outcome listed in #3. 5. Please provide a summary of your assessment results. 6. Describe your departmental action plan and priorities to address your assessment findings. 7. What is your timeline for implementation of this action plan? Thoughtful responses to those prompts are signs that the power of analysis and reflection offered by sound assessme nt has taken hold in many units. For example, the Department of Political Science, in response to Prompt #4 above about assessment methods used, offered the following: The Political Science department assesses student outcomes in the required Methods cla ss and in all of the senior seminars. The ideas behind assessing student outcomes at those points are (1) that the work of students in the senior seminars represents what students learn over their time in our program and (2) that the Methods class, as the only class required of all students, provides a place to measure progress in a number of analytical and research skills part -way through the major. In addition, all supervisors of undergraduate honors theses also write reports on the strengths and weakness es of the thesis. Intermittently, the department conducts focus groups of graduates. For the past few years, we used a grid that listed a large number of student outcomes. (Examples of the grids for the Methods classes and for the seminars are attached.) After using these grids for a few years, our assessment director decided that they did not encourage thoughtful replies on the part of faculty. Further, faculty tended to think of ways they could improve their own classes instead of thinking more globally about the major as a whole. And it was difficult to summarize the rather narrow and specific findings into a meaningful assessment report. During this academic year, the department developed a more open -ended questionnaire (attached after the grids). This questionnaire was used by faculty to report student outcomes in the methods classes and seminars during the 2010 -11 academic year. During 2011 -12, the department will evaluate whether the new questionnaire adequately serves our needs. In its responses to Prompt #5, which asked for a summary of assessment results, the Department of English evidence d prudent critique in the context of each of its programs, followed by clear departmental action plans and timelines for the implementation thereof, as presented in Figure 10 . The comprehensive nature of this assessment audit by the College of Arts and Sciences provides not only a wealth of solid program assessment information on which faculty and academic leadership can act, but provides additional example s of how pedagogy and, therefore, student learning is enhanced by regularly living the assessment cycle. 91 Chapter V: Criterion Three Figure 10: Summary of Assessment Results for Department of English Summary of Assessment Results Departmental Action Plan Timeline for imp lementation Writing Program: Assessment over the past several years indicates that the courses, while generally successful, would benefit from more opportunities for personalized instruction in a workshop format. In addition, technological resources in t he CAI lab and online materials need to be upgraded. Writing Program: A grant proposal is being revised and resubmitted that would support substantial revisions of writing courses, emphasizing increased use of online materials and small group workshops. Writing Program: The grant will be resubmitted in the 2011 fall semester. The CAI Lab has been redesigned to permit small group workshops in 2011 - 12. The rest of the revision (new server, new online materials) will be implemented in the 2012 fall semester , contingent on the funding of the proposal. Core Curriculum: In 2009 -10, there was some concern that courses were inconsistent in introducing students to the terms and techniques of literary interpretation, and to the components of different literary f orms (image, narrative, character, etc.). In 2010 -11, there remains some concern that the 200-level courses need to be consistent in achieving a set of objectives (introducing students to literary forms and elements). There is also some concern about the function of 300 -level courses, which are both core and major courses. Core 200 -level Courses: The syllabus for each course taught by a graduate student or adjunct instructor is now reviewed ahead of time by the Undergraduate Director. The structure of t he 200 -level core curriculum will be reexamined by the Undergraduate Committee. Core 200 -level Courses: The Undergraduate Committee will examine the program of 200 -level courses during 2011-12. Any changes would be implemented in 2012 -13 at the earlie st, contingent on whatever College approval may be required. English Major: Assessment of the English Major will be conducted during the 2011 -12 academic year. The structure of the major curriculum may need to be more closely aligned to the research sp ecialties of faculty hired during the past six years. English Major: The structure of the English major will be reexamined by the Undergraduate Committee. The relationship between 300 - and 400 -level courses will also be examined. A possible new track in Professional Writing may be added to the Major. English Major: The Undergraduate Committee will examine the role of 300 - and 400 -level courses in the major, and will make a report to the English faculty in the 2012 Spring Semester. Creative Writin g: Hiring a writer of fiction has given needed stability and range to the Creative Writing program. A new series of advanced \"craft\" courses should be developed to focus on specific problems in creative writing. TBD TBD M.A. Program: The objectives of the M.A. program emphasize close reading of texts, familiarity with different methods of interpretation, and ability to develop an informed, persuasive interpretation. The M.A. exam did not seem to provide the best test of a student's ability to meet tho se goals. M.A. Program: The English Department M.A. exam has been redesigned and was first implemented in August, 2010. M.A. Program: The first year of the new exam format has been judged a success by those students and faculty members who have engaged in the exam. Assessment will continue each year, with a formal evaluation after five years. Ph.D. Program: The key finding in the Graduate Committee's assessment of the doctoral program was a disconnect between the doctoral examination and the prospectu s, often leading to a delay before the student began the dissertation. Ph.D. Program: (1) The timeline for completion of the Ph.D. and the structure of the doctoral exam and prospectus were redesigned in April, 2010, following a year -long assessment b y the Graduate Committee. (2) The number of students admitted for doctoral study will be re - evaluated, with the expectation of higher admission and continuation criteria, contingent on additional funding for students in the program. Ph.D. Program: (1) T he new timeline, and the new structure of the doctoral exam and prospectus, are being implemented in 2011, and assessment will be provided by faculty and students who are engaged in this process. (2) The size of the Ph.D. program will be examined in 2011 -12, and any selective reduction would be phased in over 3 -5 years. Any reduction will be contingent on funding for graduate students, and funding for the English Department to replace graduate student instructors in core writing and literature courses as needed. 92 Chapter V: Criterion Three Colleges, schools , and centers throughout the University ask for similar work from their component units. Several detailed examples of successful assessment practices are offered below . They serve as both evidence of the quality of assessment at SLU, and also as guides to those academic units whose assessment efforts are not yet as mature. Assessment in the Legal Research and Writing program in the School of Law, which spans the first three semester of the Juris Doctor curriculum, is coordi nated among faculty in several ways. All students are expected to achieve particular educational milestones during the program, and students are given the same exams to measure progress. Doing so enables evaluation of the various instructors working towa rd shared goals, as well. The John Cook School of Business (CSB) collects, analyzes, and feeds information about its outcomes back to the dean, department, and program leaders with the goal of continuously improving its programs, its products, and the co mmunity served. The unit's assessment plan reflects these efforts. To foster assessment throughout the School of Business and to benchmark expectations for faculty and students alike, the School of Business publishes its assessment plan, practices, reporti ng forms, etc. on its website . The goal of assessment is to use the information obtained to improve the academic programs as well as to reflect upon and to advance the assessment program itself. The School for Professional Studies (SPS) has clear assessment outcomes in Section VIII of their latest accreditation report that shows the various learning outcomes of students in their education programs, how they relate to various state and professional programs, and a summative rating for the student. The accreditation self -study reports of four departments in Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology set out detailed educational objectives and assessment methodologies that are designed to ensure that educ ational outcomes are achieved and that programs are improved. The departments of Parks College make use of multiple indirect assessment methods \u2014town hall meetings, alumni survey results, student exit survey results, informal communication with alumni, industrial advisory committee meetings, and end of the semester rap sessions \u2014in addition to conventional direct assessment methodologies. The School of Public Health (SPH) has clearly stated student learning outcomes based upon a series of core competencies a nd concentration competencies. A competency matrix tracks the competencies by course to assure that all competencies are covered in the academic program and that there is minimal overlap between courses. All syllabi include the competencies for that cour se and assessments are based upon these competencies. All courses are evaluated using an external evaluation tool (IDEA) that has been used for the past 20 years. The results of these evaluations are used by the department chairs in their yearly evaluati on of faculty to help faculty improve their teaching. All concentrations leading to a Master of Public Health degree require a practice experience that is supervised by a faculty member and by a preceptor within the internship organization; the internship experience is evaluated by the preceptor and students are required to make a presentation of their internship experience. The School also tracks graduation and placement rates and periodically conducts alumni surveys. The School places emphasis on socia l justice, community involvement, and collaboration which fits within the framework of The Five Dimensions of Saint Louis University. All data is readily available in the document created for its disciplinary accrediting body. The Department of Theologica l Studies (DTS) within the College of Arts and Sciences has clear student learning outcomes for all of its programs (B.A. minor/major, M.A., and Ph.D.), and strives to connect them with The Five Dimensions of the SLU Experience . Since 2008, DTS has had sp ecific assessment procedures in place that include: (1) electronic pre - and post -testing for all THEO 100 courses, with an expansion of testing into 200 level courses; (2) use of an assessment handbook that provides DTS faculty with learning goals and as sessment policies for all programs (e.g., on the low end, it details learning outcomes for all 100 -300 core courses in matrix form and on the high end, it provides learning outcomes and rubrics for assessment for the dissertation), procedures, and 93 Chapter V: Criterion Three practice s including multiple examples of rubrics for various assignments across the four programs; (3) a standing assessment committee that works with the directors of the academic programs and DTS chair to review collected data and submit a assessment report wi thin the annual report; (4) and, at least one assessment faculty meeting per semester as a means of closing the data loop by clear communication about changes in learning outcomes and/or assessment procedures. In addition, the DTS conducts exit intervi ews for all majors, MA and PhD students. The Department of Educational Studies, the Department of Educational Leadership and Higher Education, and the Department of Counseling and Family Therapy within the College of Education and Public Service (CEPS) als o have extensive accreditation reports available for view that clearly tie learning outcomes to student data, in particular through graduation rates, alumni surveys, and placement data. The School of Social Work has extensive survey data and focus group d ata used to help faculty and administrators evaluate and improve their programs. Madrid leadership appointed an assessment director to help lead faculty in assessment. The institutional decision to align all Madrid programs with those in St. Louis was an important one for the campus, as it strives to best coordinate assessment with St. Louis colleagues. In a related move, the John Cook School of Business added a Madrid Campus faculty member to its assessment committee to coordinate learning outcomes asse ssment in its Common Body of Knowledge and International Business programs. Collectively, it is evident that assessment practices vary by level of detail, focus, and degree across different disciplines/academic units. Likewise, some academic units, in sp ite of their student -learning focus, have yet to formalize their student learning outcomes and use them to drive curricular and pedagogical improvements. But nearly all programs University -wide have articulated some form of learning outcomes, and are meas uring student learning in various ways. In addition, each school/college conducts its own course evaluations, and many collect and analyze alumni surveys, placement data, and graduation rates. However, the proverbial culture of assessment has not yet b een fully realized across all units at SLU. And much of the gap that needs to be bridged is at the institutional level, as the aforementioned lack of University -wide learning goals aligned with The Five Dimensions remains an obstacle \u2014although an obstacle that, in Spring 2012, is beginning to be hurdled as an effort to identify and formally adopt those goals is underway. Curriculum Committees Both the Undergraduate Academic Affairs Committee (UAAC) and Graduate Academic Affairs Committee (GAAC) \u2014the two University -level curriculum committees \u2014ask all those making new program requests to detail the programs' student learning outcomes. Recognizing the need for more comprehensive assessment planning prior to the adoption of any new programs, both of those co mmittees adopted new protocols for submitting new program requests. Those protocols raise the expectations for the development of specific, measurable student learning goals and related assessment plans. In add ition, they ask for more details about how a proposed program will contribute to the University's mission and goals in the context of other, related academic programs; this will provide more and better data to inform academic planning and prioritization efforts. Assessment Workshops Workshops on developing and implementing strong program -level student learning outcomes were conducted by the Associate Vice President for Assessment via the Reinert Center for Teaching Excellence throughout the mid - to late 2000s, but need to be updated and offered again. Participation was not mandatory, but those who participated reported that they were helpful. Mandatory assessment workshops for chairs, deans, and program directors would be beneficial for further establish ing a culture of assessment at SLU. 94 Chapter V: Criterion Three Core Component 3b The organization values and supports effective teaching Saint Louis University's commitment to supporting effective teaching is apparent in its ability to attract well qualified faculty member s; 99% of full-time, tenured and tenure -track faculty members hold terminal degrees in their field . Our institutional mission demands that our faculty be effective teach ers, and our students attest to the high quality of teaching and the faculty's engage ment with students . For example, SLU's results from the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) regularly indicate that SLU s cores high in terms of faculty engagement with students among research universities nationwide. Additionally, in 2010 -2011 the Vice President of Academic Affairs established a task force to more clearly define teaching standards and develop processes and metrics via which the quality of teaching could be more uniformly evaluated throughout the University . Overall, four areas showcase how the University values and supports effective teaching: Hiring for effective teaching Importance of teaching in promotion, tenure , and annual faculty reviews Teaching support for faculty Recognition of teaching excellence Hiring for Effecti ve Teaching The commitment to effective teaching is reflected in hiring and development practices of colleges, schools, and centers across the University. The University actively recruits faculty members who are not only well respected in their field but also have solid teaching credentials. U niversity -wide hiring policie s recommend that incoming faculty (full -time and part -time) are screened on the basis of criteria such as teaching accomplishments, past teaching responsibilities, teaching style, and sh ort- and long -term teaching goals. Teaching quality is also reviewed for promotion, mid -tenure review, tenure, and annual review of faculty members. For example, the Cook School of Business' strategic goals for 2012 -13 include a statement on the impo rtance of hiring faculty who are highly effective teachers, embody Jesuit ideals, and conform to the AACSB international standards. Hiring practices also outline that, post hiring, all new faculty participate in University -wide and unit -level new faculty orientation programs. These programs ensure consistency of messaging to new faculty and communicate about various important academic resources provided by the University. The University -wide new faculty orientation program specifically emphasizes the im portance of effective teaching via sessions that introduce new faculty to various teaching resources and extensive support for teaching available from the Reinert Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE). In fact, the CTE offers a Certificate in University Tea ching Skills and various workshops to promote effective teaching. Since 2009, over 25 full -time faculty have earned the CTE Certificate. New faculty members also take advantage of various workshops and orientation sessions organized by their particular c olleges/schools/centers and other University bodies. The importance of teaching effectiveness is not only crucial when hiring full - and part -time faculty members, but also during the hiring and development of graduate assistants with teaching responsibil ities. All University -funded graduate assistants are required to participate in an orientation program organized by the Center for Teaching Excellence. The colleges/schools/centers also provide teaching resources directly to their teaching assistants. Fo r example, in the Spanish Graduate Studies Program in the Department of Modern and Classical Languages, students who have no previous teaching experience can apply for \"TA -to- be\" training during their first semester. Assistants are also encouraged to pursu e the CTE's Certificate in 95 Chapter V: Criterion Three University Teaching Skills, offered to graduate students as well as faculty. Participation in recent years has averaged about 25 graduate students per year. In 2011, participation in the certificate program spiked to approximat ely 150. The Importance of Teaching in Promotion, Tenure and Faculty Reviews The commitment to importance of teaching is well understood since it is identified as a primary criterion for both annual faculty reviews and rank and tenure reviews . The dif ferent levels of teaching effectiveness required for Instructor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor are described in the Faculty Manual . At Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology, for example, teaching is assessed thro ugh students' course evaluations, a teaching/course portfolio with graded samples of homework, quizzes, and tests, and final exams. Individual faculty members' average scores on student evaluations are compared with departmental averages, leading to c onstructive feedback for continuous improvement in teaching offered individual faculty member during annual reviews. Teaching loads are evaluated by credit hours as well as contact hours. Self -assessments of teaching performance include reflective statements on (1) overall strengths, including innovations in teaching and opportunities for improvement; (2) professional development actions taken to improve teaching performance; and (3) other information regarding teaching performance including honors and awards received for teaching excellence. The programs in Parks also seek professional accreditation. The aviation program within Parks College is accredited by the Aviation Accreditation Board International (AABI) while the engineering programs are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). Both agencies require faculty members to focus their teaching so that students achieve their respective outcomes by graduation. In the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), teaching is eval uated by student evaluations as well as via peer evaluations, especially in courses prerequisite to those of others offered in the department. In the CAS and across the institution, faculty are required to submit annual activity reports as part of their a nnual reviews. Annual reviews include analysis of the number of student credit hours taught, results of student evaluations, evaluation narratives, peer classroom reports, and the artifacts comprising teaching portfolios. Other teaching attributes conside red for evaluation include curriculum development, pedagogical software development, and awards received. At the School of Business, for promotion and tenure, the teaching evaluation includes a statement of the candidate's teaching philosophy, teaching me thodology, pedagogical activities, and awards received in addition to student evaluation of teaching. The numerical summary of teaching evaluations completed by the dean's office is also used as a benchmark for individual faculty members' teaching evaluati ons. Student course evaluations are used in all the schools and colleges to evaluate teaching. Programs that receive professional accreditation have additional standards for and evaluations of teaching. Teaching Support for Faculty Saint Louis Univer sity is committed to providing faculty development and support for classroom teaching. The University Libraries, Information Technology Services, and the Reinert Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE) work both independently and collaboratively to provide se rvices such as faculty mentoring, technical and pedagogical support for instructional technologies, and direct classroom instruction in collaboration with faculty. The sole mission of the CTE is to support Saint Louis University faculty and graduate stud ents so that they can better serve the intellectual, spiritual, and social needs of all learners. The CTE has nine full - time staff positions, and three graduate student assistants. Programming ranges from informal teaching consultations to formal worksh ops on a wide range of topics, including syllabus development, assignment development, Ignatian pedagogy, and assessment at the assignment, course and program levels. The CTE also collaborates 96 Chapter V: Criterion Three with Information Technology Services (ITS) to provide support for faculty using instructional technology. The CTE focuses on the pedagogical aspects of technology (both hardware and software applications) in the classroom. Examples of these include Blackboard, Wimba, and Tegrity lecture capture. The CTE also spo nsors speakers and seminars that provide additional support for the development of high - impact pedagogies. For example, in 2011 the CTE joined with the Division of Student Development to host a workshop for faculty by Dr. Michele DiPetro, co -author of How Learning Works: Seven Research -Based Principles for Smart Teaching . Likewise, throughout 2011 -2012, the CTE offered a series of programs focused on the role of writing in te aching and learning processes, such as: designing effective assignments, workin g with second - language writers, and evaluating written work. The Saint Louis University Libraries have developed course - and curriculum -integrated information literacy partnerships with disciplinary faculty to ensure SLU graduates have the skills they nee d to be successful in all areas of life. Recognition of Teaching Excellence Faculty members are awarded recognition for excellence in teaching at many levels within the University. Examples of such recognition include: The Student Government Awards f or Faculty Excellence are granted by students to faculty members. One professor in each of the divisions of the College of Arts and Sciences (humanities, sciences, social sciences) is chosen for an Excellence in Teaching Award. An Excellence in Mentoring A ward is also given to one faculty member from the College. For all these awards, nominations are made by faculty members and students. The School of Medicine annually recognizes faculty via the Attending Physician Excellence in Teaching Award. The Doisy Co llege of Health Sciences grants faculty awards for Excellence in Teaching, Mentorship, and Clinical Education. The College of Arts and Science awards the William V. Stauder, S.J., Award for Excellence in Teaching in the Natural Sciences annually. Student G overnment in Madrid introduced a Teaching Award in 2010 recognizing outstanding instruction. As evidenced by the above list, most of the recognition for teaching excellence occurs at the college/school/center level. University -level awards or other reco gnition for teaching excellence University - wide may be well -received and supported by faculty, staff and students. Excellence in teaching is advanced by the scholarship of teaching and learning, which provides for an exchange among faculty of ideas and e xperiences that enrich es both the ir development and the students who subsequently are exposed to new and different pedagogical approaches. Saint Louis University acknowledges the value of faculty inquiry and scholarly research in this area through the Jam es H. Korn Award for Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, presented annually by The Reinert Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE). Faculty Development Saint Louis University offers numerous events and activities for faculty development across its varied c olleges and schools. In keeping with the University's Jesuit mission, these opportunities are for both professional and personal growth. They are offered on annual, semester, monthly, and semimonthly bases, with intervals determined by the particular coll ege/school/center. Each college/school/center routinely offers a variety of workshops, conferences, guest lecturers, discussion panels, symposia and other events. Topics range from finding external funding, ethics, community outreach, and addressing contem porary social issues particular to the specific academic disciplines. Examples of reoccurring development opportunities include: 97 Chapter V: Criterion Three College of Arts and Sciences: Brown Bag Series Discussions are held on monthly basis with a variety of social, spiritual, aca demic topics related to the University's mission. The John Cook School of Business: The school hosts a Dean's Breakfast Series featuring monthly discussions and presentations with local and international business leaders addressing varied topics affecting the business community and business education professionals. College of Education and Public Service: The College hosts conferences, workshops, and panel discussions on a semester basis, with topics relevant to each of its five units. Emphasis is place d on community outreach efforts and the College's role in collaborating with community development initiatives. Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology: The College periodically offers one - and two-day conferences and colloquium events ope n to faculty and community members; topics are specific to the discipline and address impacts on the wider society. SLU School of Law: The Law School offers monthly conferences and symposia on law -related topics. SLU Office of Research Services: The ORS offers regular updated workshops that assist faculty and staff in the process of finding external funding sources, and the legal and regulatory requirements involved. Core Component 3c The organization creates effective learning environments. SLU creates effective academic, developmental, and physical learning environments on our campuses, in our virtual educational settings, and on and our off -site, community, and global locations. People, programs, services, and other resources support such en vironments. By dedicating personnel as well as financial and physical resources, SLU intentionally works to develop, coordinate, and support learning environments to support student learning and faculty development. Determining the independent and collec tive impact of such efforts remains a challenge. We plan to address this assessment challenge via the University's new strategic planning initiatives, developing in the 2011 -2012 academic year. Academic Learning Environment The University cultivates form al and informal academic learning environments. SLU provides extensive programming and a climate of support for students in transition and students with unique needs. The University learning environments serve students transitioning from high school into u niversity culture; students transitioning developmentally; students with unique challenges, whether struggling academically or requiring enhanced academic rigor. SLU provides students with academic support services including tutors, supplemental instructor s, and writing consultants. A testing center and a disability office are maintained to support students with special needs. The institutional culture recognizes and supports variances in students' learning styles. Faculty and staff are provided with lea rning environments supportive of scholarly and professional development. SLU also supports learning labs, simulation labs, communication labs, and natural science labs. The University created and sustains learning environments to support freshmen student s in their transition into university culture. Examples of freshmen transitional learning environments include the SLU 101 and Welcome Week orientation programs, first -year Learning Communities, First -Year Intere st Groups (FIGs), and University 101 (a one credit college transition and success course). Tools for assessing student adjustment include surveys, focus groups, and the Map -Works assessment, which provides infor mation on how students are transitioning and if they are at risk in key categories. Students identified as at risk to struggle are contacted by key Division of Student Development staff and academic advisors and offered assistance. 98 Chapter V: Criterion Three SLU is committed to se rving underserved populations and to providing learning environments and resources to first generation and/or socio -economically challenged students. The University implements and supports federal TRiO programs (such as Student Support Services, McNair Sch olars, and Educational Talent Search). It executes specialized academic and advising support, undergraduate research opportunities, and a summer enrichment program to support these students. The Billiken Bridge to Success summer program was restructured in 2009 and is now a residential, multidisciplinary program that includes academic courses, math and writing support, seminars with faculty, leadership and service development, financial management, and multicultur alism. SLU provides learning environments for students who demonstrate academic excellence and commitment to a high level of academic rigor. The Honors Program (also thriving in Madrid ), Pre-Professional Health Studies , and Pre-Law Programs provide academic opportuniti es and specialized advising that exemplify supportive learning environments. The specialized academic programs provide unique undergraduate research opportunities, smaller classes, experiential learning opportunities, and leadership development to our students. Madrid models its learning support services on those available at the St. Louis campus. Special events also serve to enhance SLU's learning environment. For example, for the Senior Legacy Symposium , academic departments may select up to three students to represent their departments through oral, poster, or creative presentations. This format provides an opportunity for seniors to showcase their senior projects while reflecting on their learning experi ence. There is also a similar Graduate Student Research Symposium. Supported by SLU's Center for Service and Community Engagement , faculty members throughout the University collaborate with community members t o provide experiential and service -learning environments for students. And faculty create and sustain learning communities for themselves at SLU. Faculty engagement in activities of the Center for Teaching Excellence, the Department of Campus Ministry and others extend support to their colleagues throughout campus. Residential Life Programming Saint Louis University administers a variety of programs that create learning environments and enhance student learning. The University provides residential Learning Communities for undergraduate students to live together. These residential Learning Communities are built around specific academic interests or themes. Within the Learning Communities, there are also First-Year Interest Groups (FIGs) that provide an opportunity for first -year students to take two to three classes together while living in the Learning Communities. In February 2011, a survey was distributed to studen ts that were in FIGs during fall 2010. Eighty -nine percent of survey respondents said they would recommend involvement in a FIG to an incoming student to help them with their transition to college and to provide an academic support group. At the graduat e/professional level, the Medical School also supports student -initiated learning communities. For example, the Service and Advocacy Learning Community is comprised of students and faculty interested in employing their medical training in support of socia l justice issues, and they host a speaker series on campus to advance their shared cause. Another example of a program that enhances the SLU's learning environment is The Last Lecture Series . This program asks s tudents to nominate faculty to give a keynote addresses as if it was the last classroom lecture they would ever present. The program showcases what highly respected faculty have learned throughout their personal and professional lives that they want to sha re with students. Several other programs such as the Bright Idea Grants , University 101 course, writing and tutoring services, service learning, TRIO Program, academic advising for athletes, and Great Issues speakers enhance student learning at the University by providing academic support, cultivating leadership, and exploring multiculturalism. They also serve as significant shared experiences which are focal points of discussio n in and outside of class. 99 Chapter V: Criterion Three Virtual Learning Environment The University's investment of substantial resources in recent years to support virtual learning environments has led to noticeable improvements in the technology relating to education for students , faculty, and staff. Through the Center for Teaching Excellence (which has hired online learning coordinators) and the School for Professional Studies (which, as a unit, offers the most online programs), the University teaches online pedagogy to full - and part -time faculty. CTE and SPS have offered a range of programs to support faculty use of technology including course design workshops, Blackboard training, individual teaching consultations, and classroom observations. Evaluations indicate online peda gogy workshops are highly valued by the faculty. In addition, schools and colleges at the University that offer courses and programs online are beginning to develop distance learning coordinator positions. The primary objective of these coordinators is to oversee the development, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of online and alternative learning format courses for the departments they serve. Throughout campus buildings, educational technology is pervasive. Each year more classrooms, semin ar rooms and related spaces are outfitted with Level 3 technology packages , most of which include document cameras, intuitive touch -screen technology control panels, room lighting controls, and more. Additiona lly, multimedia and other technology products and services are available throughout SLU campuses. Physical Learning Environment Saint Louis University provides physical space to complement or support studen t learning. The Student Success Center was designed to cluster programs and services around the one -stop shopping concept for students. There are some premier spaces on campus, such as the John Cook School of Bus iness atrium, that are destination spots for studying and group work. The Simon Recreation Center was renovated to create additional space for fitness classes and workout space. The new Health Sciences Education Union provides large lecture space, a clinical skills center, and common space with a caf\u00e9. The repurposed/redesigned Des Peres Hall has space for offices, study space, and computer labs to support the internation al learning environment. To capture more space for student research and study in SLU's St. Louis library buildings, an off -site storage facility was opened in 2009. It houses about 600,000 volumes of still important but lesser -used materials from the th ree local libraries. Since the last accreditation visit by the Higher Learning Commission, notable changes have been or are being made in the physical facilities of all of SLU's libraries to improve them as locations for study, research, collaboration, an d consultation. The student -centric renovations of the Medical Center Library include upgraded electrical outlets, replacement of carpeting and furniture, creation of a glass -enclosed silent study area, and the installation of a new glass entryway with ca rd-swipe access to allow students to use the facility after general service hours. An exciting development was the pledge of a $25,000 gift by the parents of a recent School of Medicine graduate who, according to the student, made the gift as a thank you to the institution for providing me with a great education, mentorship, and a wonderful experience these past four years. This generous gift will fund a state -of-the-art central service desk for the library. Pius XII Memorial Library is undergoing its most significant renovation since the mid -1980s. In FY2011, student leaders made the case that libraries must be envisioned not just as repositories of information, but as places that inspire discovery and are conducive to study. The University administra tion responded favorably and renovations began in January 2012. When they conclude this summer, Pius will have new ceilings, lighting, and flooring; furniture providing additional seating for both individual and group study; increased electrical connectiv ity; and enhanced Wi -Fi. The Madrid Campus Library soon will move to a newly renovated building in which its floor space will increase 50%, providing more \u2014and more comfortable \u2014study areas as well as expanded space for library services and collections. 100 Chapter V: Criterion Three With the January 2012 announcement that SLU's School of Law will move to a downtown site, planning began to determine the implications for the law library. Students have also requested additional study space or program space for students and faculty to gathe r in the residence halls \u2014particularly appropriate with the advent of residence -based learning communities. Meeting this call for increased and improved physical space will be more difficult due to housing capacity, but there is a University committee inve stigating options. Core Component 3d The organization's learning resources support student learning and effective teaching. Saint Louis University has in place a wealth of learning resources that are instrumental in supporting teaching effectiven ess and quality student learning. Many of these feature assessment programs that both substantiate the University's significant investments in them and evidence directions for improvement and greater efficacy. Several of these assessment programs or plans could be used as models to help others develop what are currently less mature programs while others need to complete assessments and implement results. Libraries As evidenced by continuous assessment (e.g., 2003 and 2006 LibQUAL+ surveys of faculty and students; a 2006 internal needs assessment; subsequent focus group series), the libraries of Saint Louis University consistently have provided strong support for student learning and effective teaching \u2014as well as faculty research \u2014through their expertly dev eloped collections, highly regarded public service, and heavily used facilities. The three St. Louis campus libraries \u2014Pius XII Memorial Library (which also houses the University Archives and Vatican Film Library), Omer Poos Law Library, and the Medical Ce nter Library \u2014as well as the Madrid Campus Library accomplish this in an environment of rapid technological change, global economic challenge, and shifts in how students prefer to and do learn. The University Libraries have extensive collections to suppo rt teaching, learning, research, and clinical care. As of June 30, 2011, the St. Louis libraries held more than 1.87M books, serials backfiles and other paper materials (including government documents), 242,000+ e -books, and 77,000+ audiovisiual items. Cu number 13,000 but through the Libraries' 1000+ electronic reference services and aggregation services, access is provided to over 70,000 additional serial titles. Further, newly -established digital collections of rare and historical it ems from the Libraries' collections are making more accessible the Libraries' distinctive collections while helping to preserve the original items. The Madrid Campus Library holdings number 8,000 books and 60 journal subscriptions; the library also maint ains a select collection of audiovisual materials. English -language and Spanish -language materials are represented in this collection. While the physical holdings of this library are small, Madrid campus students and faculty have access, via the SLU prox y server, to most of the electronic resources available at the St. Louis campus. In fact, the Madrid and St. Louis libraries cooperate in other important ways related to collections: The integration of the Madrid library online catalog with that of SLU' s St. Louis libraries (2006); Support for interlibrary loan for the Madrid library via electronic document delivery (2008); Madrid library use of ERes, the St. Louis libraries' online course reserve system (2010); and The incorporation of a link to the Ma drid library on the main navigation bar of the SLU Libraries newly designed website (2011). In addition to traditional interlibrary loan services, SLU's St. Louis libraries are members of MOBIUS, a non - profit consor tium of 66 Missouri libraries (i.e., 59 academic libraries, 5 public libraries, 1 special library, and 101 Chapter V: Criterion Three the Missouri State Library). The consortium's purpose is to share library materials, information, and services using accessible, cost -effective methods. The MOBIUS Union Catalog currently includes records for over 23 million items, greatly expanding its member libraries' resource base. The teaching of information literacy skills in partnership with the discipline -based academic faculty has been a longst anding activity of SLU library faculty, and one that grows more essential over time, particularly given the impact of the Web on the availability of information. Library faculty contribute to student learning through in -class presentations, online tutorial s, one -on-one research consultations, collaboration on student assignments, and the development of instructional and research guides. The Libraries' philosophy is to offer students opportunities for effective learning, efficient researching, and informatio n consumption and evaluation within the context of their disciplines. In FY 2011, the faculty of the three St. Louis campus libraries conducted 660 information literacy sessions with groups, primarily of SLU students at all levels, as well as 5,700+ in -person consultations of at least 20 \u2014and typically 45 to 60 \u2014minutes. In response to the growing emphasis on assessment of the impact of the Libraries and related services on student learning and effective teaching, the position of University Libraries' Assis tant University Librarian for Research and Assessment was created to lead evaluation activities and information coordination across units in the Medical Center and Pius Libraries via an assessment task force. Assessment metrics range from manual counts to software -generated statistics to focus groups and survey methodology. The Environmental Scan and Assessment Plan for these libraries document ongoing efforts and commitment to recurring analysis and improvement of all aspects of library operations; as su ch, these initiatives tie into a five -year strategic plan. Reinert Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE) The Reinert Center for Teaching Excellence has steadily expanded its quality contributions to effectiv e teaching through programs, staff expertise, and learning technology evaluation and support. The Center is poised for another leap in significant impact in the coming three to five years under new leadership and expanded staffing. The evolution of the CTE since its inception in 1992 has been steadily positive and evidence shows it makes a substantial contribution to effective teaching at Saint Louis University. Having emerged as far more than the resource center for graduate teaching assistants within the Graduate School \u2014its initial purpose \u2014the constellation of programs, services, and resources provided by the CTE reaches graduate teaching assistants, part-time faculty, and pre -tenure members of the faculty as well as the most senior professors. Beginn ing in the 2009 -2010 academic year, the CTE established itself as a relevant presence for all the campuses by extending its workshops and certificates to faculty and graduate students on the Madrid Campus through video -conferencing, appointing a Madrid cam pus representative to its advisory board, and making its services available to Madrid campus faculty. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the programs and services offered by the CTE, the director and staff members have developed assessment approach es including use of an Executive Steering Committee and Advisory Board. In addition, the staff administered campus -wide surveys soliciting feedback in both 2005 and 2009. The results have shaped strategic planning directions as well as existing services. Respondents who had used programs offered by the Center were asked to indicate whether each of the programs they had used had great, some, or no impact on their teaching. The following programs were rated as having some (or great) impact on teaching: c ourse design (85%), Small Group Instructional Feedback (SGIF) (70%), Consultations (76%), Effective teaching seminars (66%), Blackboard training and support (61%), service learning meet and greets (60%), classroom observations (60%), Center sponsored guest speakers (58%), customized workshops (55%), and conversations/coffee breaks (50%). Programs reported to have the greatest impact on teaching were curriculum/course design assistance and individual consultations with Center staff. 102 Chapter V: Criterion Three Significant personnel and organizational changes are worth noting at this time as they will have influence over the future of the Center in the coming years. In 2009 -2010 new directions for the program were identified, the director position was modified, and the search for a new director was conducted. Also in 2009 -2010, service - learning as one of the triad components of the Center's foci was shifted to the newly formed SLU Center for Service and Community Engagement. Remaining central to the mission of the Reinert Center f or Teaching Excellence are two components: teaching effectiveness and learning technologies. Integrated Advising & Mentoring System In the 2005 -2006 academic year a survey of student academic advising at SLU was conducted and resulted in a proposal for a major overhaul of services students needed for a quality educational experience to support them through their undergraduate career and beyond. Seven recommendations were acted on, establishing the Integrated A dvising and Mentoring System which includes a two -tiered system with each student being assigned both a faculty mentor and academic advisor. Academic advising offices are now included in each undergraduate college and school, as well as in offices suppor ting several specialty programs. Committee structures and an assessment plan have been established to monitor the experience of students in the system, promote communication and collaboration, and enhance coordination in a decentralized system. Assessment efforts regarding the implemented system have included academic advisor focus groups in spring 2008, student focus groups in fall 2009, a faculty mentor survey in spring 2010, and the dissemination of an evaluative instrument to assess student experiences within the model in spring 2011. Analysis of data gathered from the spring 2011 instrument has resulted in formal recommendations for change that have been discussed with academic and advising leaders throughout the University; those recommendations are currently under consideration. While the Madrid Campus has not adopted the same Integrated Advising and Mentoring model in place in St. Louis, faculty and staff in Madrid have notably expanded their advising and related support services, especially in re sponse to the need to support degree programs. In 2005, a Career Services position was established to coordinate internships and serve graduating students, as was a dedicated staff advisor for new degree -seeking students; a second staff advisor was hired in early 2011. Evidence attesting to the effectiveness of Madrid campus advising has been gathered only sporadically (for example, a 2011 survey in anticipation of advising meetings); however, probation response work, advisor lists, feedback from student interviews, and records tracking student progress show the level of individualized attention students receive from faculty and staff. Similarly, the evolution of orientation programs and advising materials (e.g. the website, the Schedule of Classes bookle t, the Madrid -specific version of SLU -101, and the Madrid campus academic Catalog ) suggest that continuous quality improvement resulted from faculty and administrative reflection on student needs. Additional opportunities exist for Madrid to assess and im prove its support services for students, including coordinating these services further with those at the St. Louis campus and developing a survey instrument to gather data from students visiting Madrid from other U.S. universities. While advising and supp ort services on the Madrid campus are continuously evolving, the University is clearly dedicating energy and resources to improving them. Student Success Centers Based on assessment of student needs, the Student Success Centers were established on the north end of the St. Louis campus in summer 2008, and at the Medical Center in the summer of 2009. The goal of the development of the Student Success Centers was to provide a one -stop-shop for student services, in a centralized location, that supported the achievement of student academic and career -related goals. Each Center offers academic support, career and disability services, and academic advising. The Department of Academic Support was established as a part of this shift, moving oversight of tutoring , writing and supplemental instruction activities from Student Educational Services (which was housed in the Division of Enrollment and Retention Management) to the Student Success Center (which is housed in the Division of Student Development). 103 Chapter V: Criterion Three New fund ing for this shift provided an opportunity to further assure adherence to the federal Student Support Services (TRiO) grant in Student Educational Services and expand availability of academic support for all undergraduate students. The establishment of th e Student Success Centers was a collaborative effort; conception, funding, and staffing were provided by the Division of Student Development, the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs, and the Division of Enrollment and Retention Management. A dditional new funding came from the University as an allocation of new spending. Student utilization of each of the individual services offered within the Centers has grown since the Student Success Centers were established. Focus has been placed on de veloping baseline data regarding student usage in the initial years. A faculty stakeholder survey was initiated fall 2010 to gauge faculty understanding and usage of/referral to resources in the Centers. All assessment data is considered for planning eff orts, and is used in designing future assessments, as well. Due to the increase of international students on SLU's main campus, the University also has developed an International Student Services Center through the Office of International Services . The need for the Center was established in part via student course evaluations and academic assessments, such as those employed in the Theology 100 course taken by all SLU students. When faculty in the Department of Theological Studies analyzed the data and found that language proficiency and other cultural issues were negatively impacting international student performance in the course, they acted by creating a special section of Theology 100 with the assistance o f the ESL Department and the International Student Services Center. Services for At -Risk Students The University also provides support to improve student success and retention rates. One specific tool utilized to aid in the identification of, and fol low-up with, at -risk students is the MAP -Works online survey system developed through Educational Benchmarking, Inc. The assessment is available for all first -time, full - time freshmen and captures information about students through database uploads, asses sments, and faculty/staff input; it then analyzes data, and reports information to students for purposes of education, and to SLU faculty/staff for purposes of support and intervention. A statistical algorithm provides information about the most at -risk s tudents. Students receive an individual student report which compares their attitudes and behaviors to a standard norm of SLU students in their class, and receive outreach from a direct connect' staff member (including University 101 primary instructors, Housing & Residence Life staff, and select academic advisors) who has access to the system. In fall 2010, we experienced an 80.8% response rate to the survey. Two years of assessment data comparing MAP -Works at -risk indicators with SLU retention data indicates a correlation between the at -risk students identified by the instrument and students who are most likely to leave the institution. Future assessment efforts will include determination of the effectiveness of intervention and outreach efforts in re taining those identified as at -risk, as well as determining ways to further connect data available via MAP -Works with other available institutional data as we implement our institutional retention plan. Other services for at -risk students include the uti lization of the Early Warning system as an opportunity for faculty to report via Banner concerns about individual students. Using the system, academic advisors then follow -up with students who are not yet registered for the next term near the end of a ter m; Student Educational Services reaches out to first -generation and academically underprepared students; and additional learning support is offered to student athletes through the Department of Athletics academic support area including mandatory study hall s and peer -mentoring. Information about student services is accessible on SLU's Integrated Advising and Mentoring System website . Students can also benefit from the services offered by the Learning Evaluation Center, which opened in fall 2011. Staffed by SLU psychology professors and clinical psychology graduate assistants, the Center is a diagnostic clinic providing comprehensive psychoeducational/neuropsychological evaluations for students needing assessment to determine the nature of academic difficulties. 104 Chapter V: Criterion Three While tying specific gains in retention to these increased efforts is difficult, SLU retention team members are working on assessment mechanisms that will, to as great an extent as is possible, isolate p rograms that evidence significant impact on retention. Overall, first -to-second year retention of full -time, first -time students has increased from 82% for the entering 2006 cohort to 86% for the entering 2010 cohort. Information Technology The Division of Information Technology Services (ITS) supports effective teaching and student learning by providing support for learning resources in a multitude of ways. There is an annual $500,000 budget to refresh existing classroom technology equipment. Comput er equipment in the classroom is replaced on a four to five year cycle and audio visual equipment is replaced on an eight year cycle to ensure the technology is adequate for teaching and learning. The ITS Customer Service Group has a dedicated telephone l ine for classroom -related technology problems that prioritizes all classroom technology calls ahead of other support calls. High priority is given to any classroom technology support call, including dispatching field technicians as soon as possible. Many steps are taken to ensure that classroom technology is working and available as much of the time as possible. Instructional Media Services provides equipment to faculty to use in class presentations; multimedia facilities in which to edit video and record audio; printing; and many other services to help faculty with lecture creation, presentation creation, and other pedagogical needs. The services are also available to students needing assistance preparing posters, audio -visual media, and some software applications for use in their coursework and evaluations. SLU has used Blackboard as its course management system for nearly a decade. The most recent survey of faculty Blackboard use indicated that approximately 35% of all SLU courses employ Blackboard in some way. All SLU courses are set up each term with a Blackboard shell so that faculty do not have to request any setup; that also helps ensure SLU's capacity to continue courses in the event of certain emergencies requiring electronic delivery. ITS op erates multiple, strategically located Service Desks that provide technology assistance to all students with computer related problems to ensure access to all necessary learning applications and systems. As more students (and faculty) access SLU Leaning M anagement Systems in non -traditional work hours, it is anticipated that support for these systems will need to increase. The Madrid campus currently employs four Information Technology Specialists supporting the learning technologies and other IT related campus needs. These specialist offer workshops on technology, and ensure that classrooms are equipped and functioning and have implemented wireless network accessibility throughout the campus. Because of the use of Blackboard and other technologies in M adrid, St. Louis -based students studying abroad in Madrid need comparatively little time to adjust to technology there. 105 Chapter V: Criterion Three Magis : Recommendations The Self -Study process evidenced a number of challenges related to this criterion, prom pting the faculty and staff engaged in the study to discuss and offer the following recommendations for institutional improvement: Recommendation Strategic Plan Implementation Maintain and regularly update the electronic resource room developed for this Self-Study as a central, University -wide repository for all program reviews, program and service assessment data, unit annual reports, and related information. Strategic Direction A: Improve Academic and Research Performance and Reputation Establish specific, measurable University -wide student learning outcomes expected of graduates of all SLU degree programs; develop a comprehensive plan via which all such outcomes are assessed. Strategic Direction A: Improve Academic and Research Performance and Reputati on Establish on the website of the Office of the VPAA a page featuring all University -wide and program -level expected student learning outcomes, related assessment plans, and annual assessment reports. Strategic Direction A: Improve Academic and Research Performance and Reputation Strategic Direction E: Develop our People and Leadership Critical Success Factor 5: Human Capital Index Strengthen professional development support of faculty on curriculum committees to ensure more rigorous assessment of core, major, minor and certificate programs. Strategic Direction A: Improve Academic and Research Performance and Reputation Strategic Direction E: Develop our People and Leadership Critical Success Factor 5: Human Capit al Index Chapter VI Criterion Four: Acquisition, Discovery, and Application of Knowledge The organization demonstrates, through the actions of its board, administrators, students, faculty, and staff, that it values a life of learning. 107 Chapter VI: Criterion Four Chapter VI: Criterion Four Core Comp onent 4a The organization demonstrates, through the actions of its board, administrators, students, faculty, and staff, that it values a life of learning. As a Jesuit, Catholic University, Saint Louis University dedicates itself to the pursuit of trut h for the greater glory of God and for the service of humanity. This phrase begins the University Mission Statement and points to the University's strong commitment to creating a community in which the discovery and sharing of truth is essential. This p ursuit of truth is part of both the academic/educational and research enterprises of the University, and is seen in efforts to provide an environment in which the intellectual, imaginative, technical, and spiritual abilities of students, faculty, and staf f are nurtured and strengthened. Central to the fulfillment of its mission, the Saint Louis University Board of Trustees, administration, faculty, staff, and student governance boards establish institutional policies, create, support, and fund institutio nal structures and academic initiatives, and provide professional development for its faculty, staff, and students to pursue knowledge in a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect. The impact of these actions is regularly reviewed, with reorganization a nd realignment occurring as needed to ensure maximum support of efforts to acquire, discover, and apply new knowledge. Institutional Policies and Provisions Support Freedom of Inquiry Academic freedom is central to the enterprise of the University. This tenet is evident in multiple University documents. The key document underlying these principles for faculty members is the Faculty Manual , which notes : Essential to the purpose of a university is the free and unhampered pursuit and communication of knowledge and truth. All members of the University, especially students and faculty members, have not only the right but also the duty to participate in this task of freely seeking after and sharing truth. Every student and every faculty member, therefore, has the freedoms of thought, of discussion, and of action that are required by the common pursuit of truth. (p. 27) The Faculty Manual further addresses the concept of academic freedom in its description of shared governance (pp. 28 -29), noting that University faculty determine their course content, method of instruction, and degree requirements in their respective programs. In a survey on shared governance conducted by the University Faculty Senate in 2007, 81% of respondents noted that academic freedom is an evident or very evident aspect of their roles as faculty, findings that strongly support the argument that the University values academic freedom. The Faculty Manual also outlines procedures through which faculty can file grievances for violations of academic freedom. The Faculty Senate Professiona l Relations Committee handles all such grievances. This committee's membership normally consists of University faculty members representing each of the Colleges, Schools, and the University Libraries. This committee makes recommendations on all complaint s it hears to the Vice President for Academic Affairs, who may accept or reject these recommendations. If accepted, they must be implemented within 30 days of receipt of the recommendations. If rejected, the Vice President's decision is final and not sub ject to appeal. With the exception of this committee and the parties involved in the complaint, all decisions are confidential . 108 Chapter VI: Criterion Four Freedom of inquiry is not limited to faculty and faculty concerns; all members of the University community are welcome to pa rticipate in the discussion of significant issues facing the University. For students, t he Student Government Association (SGA) , chartered through the University's Board of Trustees, functions as the voice for students concerning University business as p art of the University's overall shared governance structure. SGA provides this voice by placing representatives on all University committees that affect student welfare . Student senators on SGA are elected, but all registered University students are con sidered sovereign members of SGA, and so may participate in shared governance. For students, the concept of academic freedom is specifically noted in the Student Conduct Policy regarding harassment. Because SGA is primarily focused on undergraduate student issues, graduate students have developed their own organization, the Graduate Student Association (GSA), to provide a voice for graduate student -specific issues, including vita - building , professional networking, and the provision of funds for professional travel. Just as students have a formal voice through SGA and GSA, f or staff, t he Staff Advisory Committee (SAC) is the University -wide voice on issues affecting a broad range of areas of the University. Its mission is to communicate the interests and concerns of a diverse University staff, function in an advisory capacity in the development, review, and implementation of University poli cies that affect staff, provide a means of communicating with administration and faculty, and to support and nurture a spirit of unity among all employees at the University. The committee meets monthly with top University administrators to ask questions d irectly of the decision - and policy -makers and make suggestions. Currently, SAC members sit on the President's Coordinating Council, Board of Trustee subcommittees, and other influential University committees, ensuring direct input from the staff perspect ive to those committees' policies and procedures . The University also uses resources such as its museums to advance the acquisition, discovery and application of knowledge \u2014and for the benefit of the entire St. Louis area. The Saint Louis University Museum of Art hosts critically -acclaimed exhibitions that serve as an extension of the classroom for SLU faculty and students, but also reach a much broader community audience. Likewise, SLU's Museum of Contemporary Religious Art , located in the heart of campus, is an interfaith museum that engages religious and spiritual themes among the world's religious traditions. It is the first museum of its kind in the world, and ai ms through its exhibits to be a center for healing and reconciliation amongst those of varied religious and spiritual traditions. Institutional Structures Support Acquisition, Discovery, and Application of Knowledge Research Administration Research Administration has evolved in many ways since 2005, in response to concerns that as a division, it was not meeting the needs of faculty and students to effectively seek and manage externally sponsored projects. Prior to 2005, the University maintained sep arate Research Services and Administration offices located on both sides of the St. Louis campus, each with their own pre - and post -award staff and procedures. In early 2005, the Vice President for Academic Affairs appointed an ad hoc committee to evalu ate the roles of all offices associated with research services and administration, with the goal of improving these services and administration. With this charge, the committee conducted focus groups, administered a survey to University researchers (facul ty, staff, and students), and reviewed policies and procedures with key research administration staff. The findings of this year -long intensive evaluation revealed a number of areas needing improvement, including the need for a centralized office, increas ed staff, increased education for University researchers regarding policies and regulations, and less redundancy of function across research administration offices. In late 2005, a multi -year process of consolidating offices to improve function and servic e to the University began. The first of these changes, beginning in late 2005, consolidated the existing research administration offices, including the University Corporate and Foundation Relations office, into the Office of Research Service Administratio n (ORSA) under the auspice of one Associate Vice President for Research. In 2006 ORSA added the Office of Innovation and Intellectual Property, and the Office of Sponsored Programs 109 Chapter VI: Criterion Four to further streamline research -related administration. In 2007 various re search compliance offices (e.g., the University Institutional Review Boards, the Environmental Safety office) were added to ORSA as well. An Office for Undergraduate Research was created to pool together campus -wide information for undergraduate students interested in research opportunities. Unfortunately its charge was ambiguous and funding was minimal, and in 2009 it was dissolved . In 2010, and as the result of a Faculty Senate Task Force recommendation , the Associate Vice President for Research p osition was elevated to a full Vice President for Research; that position now oversees all University research initiatives, including proposal development, project and fiscal administration, financial reporting, and compliance with federal regulations, an d reports directly to the President. These changes have led to the development of a number of new and modified initiatives to support the acquisition and discovery of knowledge through research. Some of these initiatives include the hiring of additi onal staff into ORSA to meet the increasing research needs of faculty and students, regular education and outreach to connect University researchers to each other and ORSA staff, and professional development seminars. Other initiatives include the buildin g of new facilities to support growing areas of research at the University. A major example of this was the construction of the Doisy Research Center, which opened in 2007, and provides a state of the art facility for research in the core areas of canc er, molecular and structural biology, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases and biodefense; neuroscience and aging; and liver disease. Additional examples include funding of special capital improvement requests made during annual budget discussions to existing research and/or teaching labs. One notable example here is new funding received by the College of Arts and Sciences in 2009 to completely renovate the Communication Sciences and Disorders Department's clinic space, which not only serves community clients, but also functions as a training and research facility for this department's faculty and students. This space is now the only speech -language pathology program in the world to install a METI Learning system (primarily used at Medical Schools for MD training) that allows real time electronic feedback to be given by faculty supervisors to their student interns while the interns are conducting client sessions. SLU's Center for Vaccine Development is one of only eight centers funded by the National Institutes of Health to co nduct vaccine research, and led pivotal H1N1 vaccine clinical studies in 2009. The work that has gone on here and at other vaccine centers across the country will prevent illness and save lives in the months ahead,\" noted University President Lawrence B iondi, S.J. at the time. \"We are proud to have been part of this critically important research.\" \"This vaccine is coming to market far earlier than we expected,\" commented U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. \"It would have nev er happened without SLU... I want to Thanks SLU for being such a great partner.\" 110 Chapter VI: Criterion Four Another important initiative has been the creation of The Presidential Research Fund (PRF), established in the Fall of 2009 to support faculty research projects that have strong potential to attract external funding. One million dollars ($1M) is made available each year , via grants of up to $25,000 awarded to investigators in a competitiv e peer review process, with reviews occurring twice annually. Simultaneously with this award being made available, additional internal funds were repurposed. A small sample of PRF awards is displayed in Figure 11.

Theological Studies 111 Chapter VI: Criterion Four The Summer Research Award, previously available to any SLU investigator for funding of summer research proje cts, is now only available for humanities -based researchers, who often have more limited access to external research funding than their colleagues in the sciences. The Beaumont Faculty Development Funds now are available for all faculty researchers, exce pt those at the Medical School and in the humanities. While the overall amount of external funding has remained fairly constant since 2005, the amount of funding requested has risen 11%, and the total number of grant submissions is up 21% in this same ti me period. Research work at SLU has also been aided by a 2009 decision to revise the distribution of facilities and administrative funds from granting agencies in a manner that stimulates more faculty research. The new policy returns 10% of these funds to the investigators, 10% to the academic departments in which the investigators are housed, 14% to the colleges/schools/centers in which they're housed, and 6% to the Office of Research Service Administration. The work of those researchers is further su pported by the Research Technology Group, established in 2010 and comprised of information technology specialists jointly funded by ORSA and SLU's ITS unit and that focuses specifically on the needs of researchers. The status and impact of these research -related initiatives is evidenced in part through the Research Administration Dashboard (see Figure 1 2), via which key indicators of research productivity are regularly tracked. Many recent developments in the institution's research agenda have been the r esult of recommendations from a Task Force to Enhance the University's Research Mission, initiated in 2009 by the Faculty Senate Executive Committee. Their charge was to develop a strategic plan for research to help facilitate research success of SLU facu lty. The Task Force's full report and recommendations, included in the HLC Resource Room, detail a comprehensive slate of proposals for the enhancement of research programs and for increasing sponsored research revenues. In fall 2011, the Vice President for Research authored an update on progress toward the Task Force's recommendations, indicating much progress as well as many initiatives still to be addressed, or not yet achieved despite attention. Several highlights of progress include: Research revenues increased approximately 10% to $62.3 M. Approximately $2 M in F&A was distributed to investigators, departments, and schools. Initial (early) President's Research Fund (PRF) progress reports showed $5:1 ROI plus IP and other benefits. A133 audit revealed no material weaknesses. Electronic systems (eIRB, eCOI) became operational in June 2011. Clinical Trials Office (CTO) was initiated and continues to become increasingly operational. Center for World Health & Medicine (CWHM) inaugurated and now operational. Research Technology Group (RTG) inaugurated and now operational. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) program inaugurated and now operational. Office of Environmental Health & Safety moved to Division. Reorganized administrative functions across division. 112 Chapter VI: Criterion Four Figure 1 2: Research Administration Dashboard FY2011 FY2010 FY2009 FY2008 RESEARCH AWARDS - Awards ($ M) 62.3 56.2 60.7 63.5 RESEARCH AWARDS - Frost Campus Grant Submissions 167 186 200 136 Grant Submissions ($ M) 46.8 52.3 81.2 23.7 Grants Awarded 90 70 83 82 Grant Awar ds ($M) 12.0 7.4 12.2 5.9 RESEARCH AWARDS - HSC Campus Grant Submissions 478 528 596 458 Grant Submissions ($ M) 207.3 304.1 315.3 271.6 Grants Awarded 378 372 334 455 Grant Awards ($ M) 50.3 48.8 48.6 57.6 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY METRICS - University Material Transfer Agreements 101 n/a n/a n/a Invention Disclosures ($ TH) 1818 n/a n/a IP Office Revenue ($ TH) 512 Attorney Fees ($ TH) 529 n/a n/a n/a CLINICAL TRIALS - University Grants Awarded 84 76 63 n/a Awards ( FV - $M) 10.2 8.2 7.7 n/a Libraries The library faculty of each of SLU's St. Louis libraries provide information literacy instruction to students in academic units through subject liaison relationships. Fu rthermore, these librarians also have established foundational information literacy programming in core areas within their related academic units, i.e., Each semester, Omer Poos Law Library faculty who also hold the J.D. degree team -teach sections of Adva nced Legal Research, an elective course available to second - and third -year law students. Medical Center Library faculty developed a web based self directed Evidence Based Medicine (EBM)Information Skills for Residency elective course for fourth -year medical students, based on the success of their existing Health Information Resources (HIR) course. This elective, introduced in 2009, now e nrolls almost one -third of all fourth -year medical students. Pre - and post -test results reflect significant improvement in the students' knowledge and application of EMB principles. 113 Chapter VI: Criterion Four Pius Library faculty enjoy a decades -long collaborative relationship wit h the Department of English Freshman Writing Program that always has included classroom sessions for students in which they would receive instruction on basic library resources. The current Freshman Writing P rogram Library Component which reaches approximate 90 course sections, each with 20 students, supports Dimensions 1 and 2 of the Five Dimensions of the Saint Louis University Experience ( \"Scholarship and Knowledge\" and \"Intellectual Inquiry and Communicat ion)\" as well as the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education . A hybrid online and in -person information literacy instruction model that includes an assessment element empowers first -year students, through a variety of learning styles and teaching modalities, to recognize their information needs and locate, evaluate, and use information effect ively. Academic Initiatives Support Lifelong Learning Learning Communities Nationwide, the value of learning communities for students has been well established, with learning communities serving to better connect students to the university, increa se retention, enhance reflection, and encourage an appreciation for lifelong learning, amongst other positive outcomes. While learning communities have been at SLU for a number of years (e.g., the Micah Residential Learning Community, established in 1995) , in 2007 a Task Force of the Undergraduate Initiatives Committee was established to develop a comprehensive system of learning communities for first -year students. A formal proposal on the establishment of learning communities was submitted to Vice Pres ident for Academic Affairs in 2008. A number of new learning communities and Freshman Interest Groups (FIGs \u2014 the curricular components of the learning communities) have resulted from that proposal, with 13 distinct learning communities available to student s in 2010. Formal evaluation of the implementation and impact of the learning community initiative was begun in 2011. A team of staff from Academic Affairs, Student Development, and the Office of Institutional Research is collaborating on the multi -staged evaluation. To align with the benchmarking expectations of the University Strategic Plan , the group is focusing on assessing the extent to which SLU's learning communities, as implemented, model the nationally -recognized high impact educational pract ices evidenced in the AAC&U's Liberal Education and America's Promise initiative . Public Lecture Series/Symposia An important aspect of continuing education and lifelong learning is attending public lect ures, symposia, and other fora in which new knowledge can be acquired . A number of such events are presented annually on 2011 -2012 Learning Communities The Arts Careers and Major Exploration Diversity and Unity Global Villa Life Sciences Micah (Faith & Service) Sustainable Planet Billiken Connections Engineering Ethical Leaders in Business Health Sciences Honors Program Transfer Student 114 Chapter VI: Criterion Four both the St. Louis and Madrid campuses. Some of these events are recurring annual events in which the entire University participate s. For example, recognizing the global challenges of the 21st century facing the next generation of leaders, SLU has long supported the Atlas Week Program , launched in 2001. This program, an annual event in whi ch multiple activities are scheduled across campus, is designed to Educate students and increase their awareness of issues of global injustice Inspire and inform student activism regarding issues of global injustice, both for the present and the future Build a community of scholars at SLU whose teaching and research focuses on global challenges by forging interdisciplinary ties and collaboration across the university Foster faculty and student cooperation in the area of international service Promote cross -cultural understanding The pinnacle event of the program is the Signature Symposium, open to faculty, staff, students, and the general public, in which keynote speakers are asked to present on topics related to political and social justice . The 2012 sp eaker is Sheryl WuDunn; recent prior speakers include Irene Kahn, Hauwa Ibrahim, and Emmanuel Jal. Other examples of recurring lecture series include the Great Issues series (current issues debates and discussions), the Last Lecture series featuring SLU faculty, and various college or departmental annual memorial or distinguished speaker series. By design, public events addressing great \u2014and often controversial \u2014issues of the day challenge students, faculty , and staff to see and experience ideas and topic s in new ways, and from new vantage points. That the SLU community has debated the merits of invitations to certain speakers, or the propriety of hosting on campus events such as the Vagina Monologues , is not surprising. The policies governing external s peakers on campus have been reviewed by SGA and University officials and revised in recent years, but remain a concern for students seeking greater freedom to extend such invitations. Such debates sustain community -wide discussion of academic freedom in t he context of SLU's Jesuit, Catholic identity. Recent \"Great Issues\" Series Speakers Ralph Nadar Ehud Barak Ben Stein Fr.

All faculty, staff, and students are encouraged to present at or attend local/region al and national conferences, and attend University -sponsored workshops. Additionally, the University provides up to 18 hours of tuition remission per academic year to full time faculty and staff for SLU courses. Formalized leave programs provide additi onal development opportunities for faculty. Three types of leaves are available: Sabbatical leave : On the St. Louis campus, f ull time tenured faculty are eligible for sabbatical leaves after 12 semesters of full time service. Faculty may apply for sabb atical leaves of one semester at full salary or one academic year at half -salary for the purpose of professional development and renewal. The Madrid campus formally introduced sabbaticals in 2009, and has a supportive budget to support faculty research an d scholarship. Developmental leave : Full-time untenured and non -tenure -track faculty members may apply for a paid developmental leave for professional development or renewal. Generally, these leaves are for one semester only. Faculty Research Leave Pr ogram : This competitive program provides one semester leaves for faculty to focus on research activities, to assist faculty develop their research agenda and allow them to compete more effectively for external funds when appropriate. Applications are acc epted from all full-time tenured, tenure track, and non -tenure track faculty. Five criteria are used to evaluate proposals: (1) the likelihood that the proposed project will make an important scholarly contribution, (2) the project's relationship to the Un iversity's research foci, (3) the applicant's record of research productivity, (4) the likelihood that the project will be completed, and (5) adherence to the application guidelines. Initial reviews are conducted at the unit level, with the final decisio n being made by the Vice President for Academic Affairs. In addition to the formal leave opportunities designed to support faculty research, the University also supports the Reinert Center for Teaching Excellence to provide professional development in ins tructional skills and pedagogy for both faculty and graduate students. A critical role of the CTE is to provide one-on- one consultation to individuals wanting to improve their teaching, and video -taping of teaching for feedback, as well as offering a Cer tificate in University Teaching Skills. Portfolio retreats are offered for tenure -track faculty to help them prepare their tenure dossiers. For staff, the Office of Human Resources offers Professional and Organizational Development consultation, career-related training, and other development opportunities . Staff with management responsibilities are eligible to enroll in a Management Development Certificate as we ll. And for students, a committee of staff members from the Division of Student Life has developed a Student Worker Professional Development manual designed to help develop in students the qualities and skills important to efficient office operations fo r students' future careers. The manual is also distributed to all offices on campus who seek out student workers via SLU's CareerLink site. 116 Chapter VI: Criterion Four Core Component 4b The organization demonstrates that acquisition of a breadth of knowledge and s kills and the exercise of intellectual inquiry are integral to its educational programs. Educating the Whole Person In support and recognition of its mission to educate the whole person, the curricula of the University integrate core courses from the humanities, n atural sciences, and social sciences to provide a framework for acquiring a broad foundation of knowledge. Each college and school determines the particular set of courses across these disciplines that can satisfy its core in recognition th at there is pluralism in disciplinary education and that some courses are more appropriate to particular disciplines and programs. For this reason there is no University -wide core. The underlying commonality across the various core requirements, though, is that these courses serve as a catalyst for cross -disciplinary reflection and inquiry. This is reflected in the Five Dimensions of the Saint Louis University E xperience (adopted in 2002), which form a conceptual framework for establishing core curricu la and other educational outcomes across the University . In 2005, the University administered a Survey of Students' Perceptions of the Core Experience . While this survey indicated a number of positive outcomes, including recognition by students that their core experience provided them with a well -rounded education, it also revealed a number of ways in which the core experience could be improved. In response, the University formed a Core Working Group, whose charge was to review the core requirements across the University, with an eye towards looking at learning outcomes, and how those mapped onto the framework of The Five Dimensions of the Saint Louis University Experience , as well as make recommendation to address issues raised in the 2005 core surv ey. Notably, this group confirmed that The Five Dimensions do provide an appropriate framework for a broad liberal arts experience for undergraduates, regardless of the specific courses used to fulfill core requirements. A number of recommendations wer e made to address the issues raised by students in the 2005 survey. Among these it was noted that the significance of The Five Dimensions , and how they tie to curricular requirements outside of a major field of study, needed better articulation to student s, prospective students, parents, and faculty. A recommendation was subsequently made that each college and sc hool articulate s the philosophy behind their core requirements in the context of The Five Dimensions as a way of addressing this issue. Since th at recommendation was made, information relating The Five Dimensions to various programs of study ha s been widely available on the SLU website to help students connect major requirements to various core curricula . These changes appear to have had an impa ct on students, as indicated by the fact that in the 2009 Survey of the Core Experience , 85% of respondents noted confidence in their ability to interrelate The Five Dimensions. Nonetheless, one remaining challenge tied to this issue is that not all Unive rsity units publicly (e.g., The 2009 Leiter Report, a peer-group ranking in philosophy, ranked SLU's graduate program in Medieval Philosophy third in the world, and the Philosophy of Religion program second in the United States. 117 Chapter VI: Criterion Four through their unit home websites) describe their core requirements, the expected outcomes of these requirements, and how they explicitly map onto The Five Dimensions . Another area from the 2005 Survey of the Core in which students noted change could be made was to standardize course requirements across multiple sections of the same course, particularly in philosophy and theology. The Department of Theological Studies (DTS) in the College of Arts and Sciences took this recommendation for their THEO 100 : Theological Foundations course, a course present in the core requirements of many colleges and schools at SLU. Fifteen to 20 sections of this course are taught per semester . Prior to the 2005 Student Core Experience Surve y, all instructors across this section were allowed to develop these courses independently, with each instructor determining the desired outcomes, grading policies, etc. In 2007, DTS created a manual for the instruction of THEO 100, which included standar dized syllabus templates, and established common ( 1) learning outcomes, ( 2) common values outcomes, and ( 3) common skills acquisition for all sections of this course, regardless of instructor. While these two examples demonstrate actions following the C ore Working Group's recommendations, a few recommendations made by this group have yet to be implemented . The primary one is the recommendation that a University -wide assessment of the core be conducted. The group noted , however, that a major challenge to doing so is the lack of a University core, or even shared educational outcomes of the various core curricula throughout the colleges and schools . As noted in the previous chapter on Criterion Three, the University has in 2011 -2012 embarked on processes to establish those shared educational outcomes, which will then enable a process to define, institution -wide, its core educational experiences that best reflect the institution's Jesuit heritage and commitment to education of the whole person, dedicated t o a lifetime of personal, professional, public and spiritual development in service of others and for the Greater Glory of God. SLU's commitment to educating the whole person manifests itself across the University, and well -beyond the academic programs. The Division of Student Development encompasses an expansive range of educational and support programs and services designed to develop students holistically, including: student activities, housing and residential life, dining services, student support an d parent services, student health and counseling, the Cross -Cultural Center, the Center for Service and Community Engagement, student recreation, athletics, and many more. The Division's mission and vision statement serves as the anchor for unit-wide stra tegic planning and assessment activities: Mission Statement The Division of Student Development facilitates programs, services and experiences that help students develop as leaders who are holistically formed, critically reflective, and socially and perso nally responsible. Vision The Division of Student Development supports the mission of Saint Louis University, as together the entire University community works to develop students into \"women and men for others\". Learning takes place, formally and informa lly, in the classroom and through the activities, experiences and lives of students outside the classroom. Among other things, these experiences emphasize leadership and service, wellness (mind, body and spirit) and mature interpersonal relationships with in the University and out metropolitan environment. As a Division, we operate in partnership with other University departments and our students to assist them in reaching their full development as persons recognizing that learning takes place, formally an d informally, in the classroom and through the activities, experiences and lives of students outside the classroom. 118 Chapter VI: Criterion Four Student formation includes the physical, emotional, social, intellectual, spiritual, vocational, and moral growth that takes place during a student's SLU experience. We also provide a range of services that contribute to a quality living - learning environment for our students, promoting lifelong values which include respect for all persons, compassion, a sense of personal responsibility, an a ppreciation of diversity, community engagement, lifelong learning, responsible citizenship, leadership, respect for faith commitments, critical thinking, and ethical decision making. Care for our students necessitates a Divisional focus on excellence in service and environments that impact student learning and development. The Division of Student Development draws upon and supports the Catholic, Jesuit mission of Saint Louis University by helping students develop as personally and socially responsible persons capable of exercising leadership in advancing the cause of human good in the world. Like all departments within the Division of Student Development, the Department of Athletics echoes the broader unit mission and vision: The mission of the Departmen t of A thletics is to provide a program of intercollegiate athletics that fosters and supports a positive educational and athletic experience, not only for student - athletes, but also for the entire Saint Louis University community. The athletics program is guided by the highest standards and ideals of integrity, sportspersonship, ethical conduct, equitable opportunities for all students and staff, including women and minorities, academic excellence and athletics achievement. The intercollegiate athletics pro gram strives to develop the whole person (body, mind and spirit) in accord with the Jesuit, Catholic mission of Saint Louis University. A clear, demonstrable outcome supporting the integrity of the athletics program is that, as reported i n the University' s most recent NCAA Federal Graduation Rates Report, the six -year graduation rate of SLU student athletes has, over the past four cohorts, averaged three percentage points higher than the graduation rate of the student population at large. National Recognition for SLU Student -Athletes' Academic Achievement SLU's student -athletes consistently earn national recognition for their academic achievement, as reflected in the following honors accorded from the 2001 -2002 year through fall 2011: Academic All -America: 22 Scholar -Athlete of the Year: 14 Academic All Conference: 105 119 Chapter VI: Criterion Four Core Compo nent 4c The organization assesses the usefulness of its curricula to students who will live and work in a global, diverse, and technological society. All units of the University, employing various methods, perform regular and ongoing assessment of the ir curricula. Many of the academic units undergo external accreditation review that requires curricular assessment as part of their respective self -studies. Units without external accreditation nonetheless engage in regular review to assess curricular u sefulness, especially with regard to meeting the global, diverse, and technological challenges of the 21st century . Academic Program Reviews Saint Louis University is committed to providing high quality educational programs to its students. As such, all programs, with or without external accreditation, are required to undergo regular, periodic review . For those programs with accreditation, this review is part of the accreditation process. For those programs without accreditation, most of which are housed in the College of Arts and Sciences, a Program Review Policy was instituted in the 2008 -2009 academic year to provide a mechanism for this assessment. This University -wide policy requires that all programs evaluate the extent to which they are: Preparing students to participate in a global society ; Documenting how the program achieves its stated student learning outcomes and program objectives within the context of the institution's mission, as well as noting what might need to be done differently, and why; Reviewing and revising (if necessary) existing teaching, research, service, and other program goals and objectives, including expected outcomes, to establish continuous improvement. As part of Program Review, programs are to bring to campus qualified external evaluators, who prepare an evaluation report that includes a review of the program self -study, interviews with program faculty, staff, and students, and meetings with other University faculty, staff, and students who may engage on a regular basis with the program being reviewed. The resulting evaluation report is to specifically address the extent to which the program is achieving its vision , mission, goals, and objectives, and the program's ability to meet emerging needs in the field. Figure 13 provides a list of some sample outcomes resulting from these program reviews. The significant revisions to the process and requirements for propos ing new academic programs, approved in spring 2011, are being followed up by a corresponding review and revision of the Program Review Policy . No non -accreditation program reviews were conducted in 2011 while the policy was being reviewed by the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs (VPAA). In late spring 2012, the Office of the VPAA will introduce a revised Program Review Policy to the University community for regular cyclical implementation thereafter. That policy will build upon the stre ngths of the new program proposal policies implemented in 2011 for new undergraduate and graduate programs, and will also codify the role of existing faculty curriculum review bodies (the Undergraduate Academic Affairs Committee and Graduate Academic Affai rs Committee) in those regular program reviews. The new Program Review Policy will satisfy requirements of the University Strategic Plan for regular, rigorous assessment and evaluation of all academic and support programs and services. It will also requi re programs accountable to external disciplinary/specialized accreditors to demonstrate accountability to University -wide educational outcomes, particularly those served by core curricular experiences in the various colleges and schools. 120 Chapter VI: Criterion Four Figure 13 : Selected Program Review Outcomes Program Year Reviewed Recommendation Action/Outcome Theological Studies 2008 Increase annual stipend amount in graduate assistantships to increase competitiveness Graduate assistantship stipends increased for all University graduate programs in FY11 English 2008 Refine and focus graduate program structure Department engaging in strategic planning to revise undergraduate and graduate curriculum, redefine areas of scholarly emphasis Math 2008 Develop emphasis in statistics education to create and enhance connections across the university New funding secured for in FY11 and FY12 for hiring of new faculty in Statistics Computer Science 2008 Hire dedicated computer support staff to move program closer to ABET accre ditation Unsuccessful in securing funds to hire dedicated support staff Physics 2008 Develop/expand concentration in experimental physics New funding secured for FY12 for hiring of new faculty in experimental physics Political Science 2008 Reduce facult y-student ratios by increasing faculty size New funding secured for FY12 for hiring of new faculty African American Studies 2009 Develop areas outside of social sciences (particularly the arts and humanities) New funding secured for FY12 for hiring of joint faculty member in Art History with African American Studies Earth & Atmospheric Sciences 2009 Clarify role and strategic direction for Center for Environmental Science New director and co -director named to begin FY12 with charge to develop new strateg ic plan for center Modern & Classical Languages 2009 Separate English as a Second Language program (due to its unique needs) from department to function as its own program ESL given its own space and resources, with a direct reporting line to the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, effective FY11 Sociology & Criminal Justice 2009 Further develop program in Anthropology New funding secured for FY12 for hiring of new faculty in Anthropology Fine and Performing Arts 2010 Increase emphasis in non - Western art New funding secured for FY12 for hiring of joint faculty member in Art History with African American Studies Educating for the 21st Century Recognizing that the 21st century presents a unique set of challenges for higher education, Saint Lou is University is committed to preparing and educating the next generation of scholars, practitioners, and leaders to address the challenges of living and working in a global, diverse, and technological society. In 2011, US News & World Report recognized Saint Louis University as one of the top institutions nationally for providing substantial academic work through its Study Abroad program. A number of international options in Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Australia are available for students , and the Madrid Campus is a viable option for student whose degree programs would otherwise prevent them from incorporating into their comprehensive educational experience a semester or year abroad (e.g., nursing, business, and engineering) . SLU also adminis ters its own study abroad program at its Madrid campus. While students from 121 Chapter VI: Criterion Four many universities choose to study at SLU -Madri d for one or two semesters, the campus permits SLU students to pursue course work toward undergraduate degree s offered by nearly all of t he University's colleges and schools . In addition, the Madrid campus hosts full degree programs (B.A., B.S., and M.A.) in selected disciplines through the College of Arts and Sciences and the John Cook School of Business. To facilitate students' experien ce abroad, the University offers both pre - and post -departure courses to provide cross -cultural preparation for study abroad, and re -entry back to the United States from a study abroad experience. Nearly 30% of SLU graduates study abroad. Alumni surveys indicate that these students' study abroad experience s had a positive impact on their growth and development. Practical Education for Health Care In the early 2000s, the Institute of Medicine, a branch of the National Academy of Sciences, published a report ( Crossing the Quality Chasm ) that described a failing American health care system. A critical recommendation of this report was that patient -care of the 21st century must be provided by interprofessional teams of health care providers in order to be st meet the needs of the patient to obtain good health outcomes. In response to these national concerns, and in recognition that preparing health professionals for the future requires an educational process that focuses on issues and concerns addressed co llaboratively with the patient and in common with several professions, Saint Louis University created the Interprofessional Education Program (IPE) for students in the health professions . The mission of the IPE Program is to prepare health professio n graduates for the types of interprofessional patient and client -centered care, and the delivery of health care services as recommended in the Institute of Medicine report. To earn a Certificate in Interprofessional Education, students must complete five courses (11 credit hours). These courses are not intended to replace specific knowledge -based or skills -based courses required for the practice of a health profession . Rather , the IP E curriculum is designed to cover the unique roles and responsibilit ies of the various health professions, principles of interprofessional teamwork, the health care system, health promotion and disease prevention, health care ethics, and evidence -based practice. Students must also complete a capstone interprofessional pr acticum by working in teams to provide direct patient/client care and/or develop and implement community health programs that meet the needs of a medically underserved population. Diversity Education In response to the changing and increasingly multicu ltural world in which our students will work and learn, Saint Louis University offers multiple undergraduate and graduate majors, minors, or certificates in the area s of diversity and multiculturalism . Additionally, as part of its core curriculum, the Co llege of Arts and Sciences has long required that students enroll in six credit hours of courses tied broadly to issues related to diversity. In 2009 a College task force was created to reexamine these requirements, recognizing the importance of appropria te diversity education to meet the needs of increasing globalization. In 2010 changes were approved to the curriculum so that students must fulfill two requirements, Cultural Diversity in the United States and Global Citizenship , in recognition that today's students need to understand issues related to cultural groups within the United States, as well be equipped for those issues related to global and transnational problems. Additionally, t he School of Medicine 's Office of Multicultural Affairs is charged with the enhancement of academic, educational and cultural interests of its students. One of its roles is to connect students with appropriate local and foreign agencies to help them develop cultural awareness and competence. Technology and P edagogy SLU's recent renovation of centrally -located Des Peres Hall included several high -tech classrooms in which students and faculty can share in the development and use of technology -enhanced pedagogy. For example, the Des Peres Learning Studio is a state-of-the-art teaching space designed by a team of faculty and students as part of the Herman Miller Learning Spaces Research Program. Using the instructional design assistance 122 Chapter VI: Criterion Four provided by the staff of the Reinert Center for Teaching Excellence, and th e unique features and technologies in the room, faculty teaching in the space experiment with new teaching strategies to create engaging and interactive learning experiences designed especially for today's learners. The Learning Stu dio space includes : flexible room furniture remote lighting, window coverings, vide o inputs and other room feature s a range of technologies, including video wa ll, iPads, and tablet computers In order to take full advantage of the flexibility of the Learning Studio, classes u sing the space are restricted to no more than 25 students. Faculty members interested in taking advantage of the opportunities presented by this unique teaching and learning space are invited to apply for an Innovative Teaching Fellowship offered by the Reinert Center for Teaching Excellence . The Fellowship provides CTE financial and personnel support to faculty for developing their courses and assessment programs. Core Component 4d The organization provides support to ensure that faculty, staff, and students acquire, discover and apply knowledge responsibly. Saint Louis University, in support of its mission, creates an academic environment that values and promotes free, active and original intellectual inquiry among its faculty and students. As a means of providing this support, the University creates a culture of ethical responsibility, through academic programming and co - curricular offerings, as well as through the establishment of research compliance offices and policies to ensure that its faculty, students, and staff acquire, discover, and apply knowledge responsibly . Curriculum Across the University, and at all degree levels, a variety of courses exist to encourage students to think and act ethically. A key component of these course o fferings are the core requirements within each college and school for a specific course in ethics. As an example, the College of Education and Public Service identifies as one of its core themes the Moral and Ethical Development of its students. To ful fill this requirement, students can take a course in Professional Ethics (EDI -394), where they study the dynamic nature of moral and professional ethical developments in a variety of service -oriented professions, and examine the impact of one's values on t he ethical treatment of individuals. Similar specific ethics course requirements exist in other of the University's colleges and schools; but more importantly, other courses within the core offerings exist outside of traditional areas of ethics instructio n (e.g., philosophy) so that students' course work is infused with ethics -related topics. For example, each of the College of Arts and Sciences' 11 core components has outcomes tied to ethical thinking, responsible real -world application of knowledge in the humanities, natural sciences and social sciences, and critical reflection. These types of courses influence students' ethical thinking and decision making, as evidenced by data from recent graduating senior surveys. When asked on a recent alumni surv ey whether their ability to use ethical principles to make decisions had changed as a function of taking core courses, seniors reported growth in this area since their freshman year. These data illustrate how the infusion of ethics -focused courses across the curriculum impacts our students' thinking and development. Ethics -focused courses are not limited to undergraduate education . Within graduate education, a number of graduate degree options, focused entirely on ethics, also exist. For example, th e Department of Health Care Ethics, housed in the Albert Gnaegi Center for Health Care Ethics, offers graduate degrees in health care ethics, with specializations in biotechnological, clinical, professional, organizational, or research ethics. The creatio n, and continued support of such programs represent the University's commitment to creating an academic environment that values ethical responsibility . 123 Chapter VI: Criterion Four As part of creating a culture of ethical responsibility, the University also details formal academic honesty/integrity policies for students and faculty. The University Statement of Minimum Standards for Student Academic Integrity (2004) reminds students, faculty, and staff that as a community of learning, an environment of mutual trust and integrity is expected and must be maintained. The specific procedures for enforcement of these standards is left to the individual colleges and schools. In a 2006 report , a Faculty Senate -sponsored Academic Integrity Special Interest Group observed that while most colleges and schools had academic integrity policies and procedures, the re was significant inconsistency across units and, sometimes, even within them . The level of authority to apply consequences varied among units, and most of the colleges/schools had no written policy regarding either jurisdictional disputes over academic integrity violations or the retention of documentation concerning incidents of academic integrity violation. Finally, the group noted that education of students as to what constitutes academic integrity violations must be addressed more aggressively at al l levels of the University. Subsequent efforts by the Faculty Senate's Academic Affairs Committee to propose University -wide guidelines to address the still salient issues raised in the 2006 report stalled. However, with the recent appointments of ass ociate vice presidents (AVPs) for undergraduate and graduate education, the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs has begun to move this important initiative forward. The AVPs, with faculty representatives and in conjunction with the Universit y's Office of the General Counsel and the Council of Academic Deans and Directors, are developing a University -wide academic integrity policy that includes formal deliberation and formal appeals processes that span multiple organizational levels, up to the University President. Centers and Co -Curricular Initiatives In addition to formal course offerings and degree programs in ethics, the University has developed and supports several centers and co -curricular initiatives to promote University -wide commun ication and collaboration on issues related to ethics education and the responsible acquisition and discovery of knowledge. While many of these centers provide formal ethics education to faculty, staff, and students, and continuing educational opportuniti es to professionals, one of the newest centers, the Center for Sustainability (founded in 2010), encourages and promotes the responsible application of knowledge, specifically to addressing society's growing envi ronmental challenges. A significant learning outcome of this degree program is that its students learn applied ethical reasoning skills as the foundation for achieving sustainability. Another example of an initiative aimed at the responsible appli cation of knowledge is the VOICES project. An overarching goal of this project (initially funded in 2002 by a grant from the Lily Foundation, with continued funding from the University) was to help faculty, staff, and students understand and appreciate how spiritual, educational, and professional identities and commitments are integrative and complementary. To achieve this goal, the project developed three areas of foci: (1) to promote reflection as a life habit through the establishment of reflection ci rcles for faculty, staff, and students; (2) to develop student internships and scholarships to create supportive communities for students to discern and develop their leadership qualities in light of their faith, as well as create speaker events to enable faculty, staff, and students to engage in deeper conversation about relevant issues; and (3) to provide faculty grants to challenge faculty to incorporate themes of spirituality, service and reflection into their existing classes and through the developmen t of new courses and co -curricular activities. The outcomes of these areas of focus are presented in the Figure 14 for the years 2006 -2009: 124 Chapter VI: Criterion Four Figure 14: Selected VOICES Project Outcomes Focus Area Outcome Promote Reflection Created 7 Reflection C ircles with 100+ Participants Create Community 40 VOICES interns 4 Men & Women for Others Scholarships Invited internationally renowned speakers to campus for lectures and interdisciplinary panels Development of Learning Communities, First -year Summer Rea ding Program, and Senior Legacy Symposium Establishment of Center for Service and Community Engagement Increased support for the Student Success Center (particularly Career Services, Academic Support, Major Exploration Advising) Development of Atlas Progra m (Goal: to increase awareness of the global issues that confront us today in an effort not only to promote discussion, but to inspire and inform action.)

The University has a number of r esearch compliance committees to oversee research activities of its faculty, staff, and students, and e nsure compliance with federal regulatory requirements. Importantly, these committees not only provide oversight, but they also provide regulatory guidance and educat ion regarding compliance issues. They also work to facilitate the research enterprise at Saint Louis University, in conjunction with the Office of Responsible Conduct of Research. As an example of facilitation, and in response to human subjects researchers concerns about lengthy research protocol reviews, the University established multiple I RBs with distinct areas of oversight in 2002. Prior to 2002, the University provided one IRB, whose charge was to provide oversight for all human subjects research protocols, regardless of discipline (e.g., medical research versus behavioral science resea rch). In 2002 , a second Behavioral and Social Sciences IRB was formed to oversee all research classified as employing behavioral or social science methods, and research investigating biomedical questions received oversight by the Biomedical IRB. In 2008 , an additional Biomedical IRB was established to address the growing need for increased oversight in this area. The creation of these additional boards has reduced reviewer workloads and improved overall review time . 125 Chapter VI: Criterion Four In July 2011, the three extant IRB s were able to be consolidated into two after the adoption of a streamlined, electronic IRB system. Additionally, SLU's IRB is now part of a collaboration with Western IRB (WIRB) that provides review for over 90% of the commercially -sponsored studies curr ently conducted at SLU. In the last decade, all University research compliance boards have provided regular workshops to further educate and familiarize the University research community with existing and changing federal regulations. Related to integr ity in the context of research and clinical care is the issue of potential conflicts of ethics and values between University health care professionals and those in the health care products industries. Such conflicts may arise in connection with promotion al activities, through financial support for a broad array of educational programs, industry -sponsored research, and social events. These activities may influence medical decision -making and have biasing effects which impact patient care. Keenly aware of such potential conflicts and the impact thereof, SLU has adopted a Policy on Medical Center Conflicts of Interest in Patient Care and Service . The policy , approved in 2011, sets forth standards consistent with the University's commitment to continually st rive for the highest standards of professionalism while actively seeking engagement with the industries impacting the health care system . Further, it define[s] specific Conflicts of Values between the professionalism and patient centeredness of the heal th professions and the business ethos of the health care products companies, and the biases which are created by interactions with representatives of those companies. The policy describes the necessity for the reporting, tracking, and monitoring of certa in interactions between Medical Center personnel and these companies , and it proscribes or limits certain activities which may impact decisions relating to patients, community service, and health professions education and research to protect the learning e nvironment and guard against conflicts of interest in patient care and service . Magis : Recommendations Although Saint Louis University does indeed promote a life of learning for its constituents in ways consistent with its mission, the Self -Study process did evidence several key challenges, to which are offered the following recommendations for University action: Recommendation Strategic Plan Implementation Establish a University -wide awareness and education program regarding academic integrit y; establish a comprehensive University academic integrity policy ; regularly inform the entire campus community about and enforce the policy; assess the effectiveness of the policy and related programming.

Strategic Direction A: Improve Academic and Research Performance and Reputation Critical Success Factor 1: Academic and Research Index Chapter VII Criterion Five: Engagement and Service As called for by its mission, the organization identifies its constituencies and serves them in ways both value. 127 Chapter VII: Criterion Five Chapter VII: Criterion Five \"The real measure of our Jesuit universities lies in who our students become. Tomorrow's 'whole per son' cannot be whole without a well -educated solidarity. We must therefore raise our Jesuit educational standard to educate the whole person of solidarity for the real world. Solidarity is learned through 'contact' rather than through 'concepts.' When the heart is touched by direct experience, the mind may be challenged to change.\" -- Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, S.J., former head of the Society of Jesus Core Component 5a The organization learns from the constituencies it serves and analyzes its capacit y to serve their needs and expectations. Service and Constituents Defined SLU relocated to the Midtown area of St. Louis in 1888 and, since that time, has served as the area's major institutional anchor. Its generations of faculty, students, and staff h ave accompanied the growth, decline, and revitalization of Midtown. Throughout this period, the University and local community have maintained an ongoing dialogue that not only resulted in SLU's deliberate decision to maintain the Midtown location, but also fostered public and private efforts to support the greater St. Louis Metropolitan area. As a Catholic, Jesuit university, Saint Louis University serves multiple constituencies, especially our students. We approach this mission with humility, knowing that those who serve must learn from whom they serve . The emphasis on service and engagement linked to learning is a continuous thread highlighted in the University's strategic planning documents . In December 2010, the University's leadership approved a Strategic Planning Framing Document , developed by a faculty think tank, to reaffirm the University's mission, acknowledge our strengths, raise the awareness of some global challenges as a matter of contextualizing the mission and goals in the future, and finally identify some key opportunities. The Framing Document notes that opportunity begins from SLU's established strengths in teaching and learning, research and scholarship, service, and health care, and it must reflect SLU's position as a Catholic, J esuit, urban institution of higher education. The Framing Document recognizes that SLU has opportunities to make exceptional contributions in many ways. The first identified is to: [d]eliver a distinctively Jesuit educational experience for all students that provides a core body of knowledge, skills, and service -learning experiences that is relevant and responsive to the contemporary world. The approach illustrates continuity of focus because t he University's 2001 Strategic Plan identified advancing co mmunity with diversity as one of its strategic directions. That plan also recognized that community service at the local, national, and international levels is an integral part of research, teaching, and learning. The University's primary focus is to educate students, and service is part of learning. In this view, students are our major constituents. Service is not exclusively a mechanism for learning because we also serve as a resource for the community. Commitment to serve permeates the institu tion, engaging academic, student development, campus ministry, and institutional support programs. Recent University conversations in St. Louis and Madrid about mission and the evaluation of performance toward achievement of mission have explored the meani ng of the term service, particular in the context of distinguishing philanthropy, volunteering, and service \u2014all of which are elements of social justice from a Jesuit perspective. More 128 Chapter VII: Criterion Five specifically, the following definitions offered by the Center for Service and Community Engagement guide many University efforts: Philanthropy: This involves collecting and giving money to a designated group or organization, for short -term, long -term, or emergency needs. Special collections in churches, direct solicitations for funds, bake sales, carwashes, and any number of grant opportunities, all fall under this category. Concerned with providing physical resources, e.g., money, clothing, buildings, food, objects and real estate, philanthropists often have little or no direct contact with the people their generosity benefits. Clearly, though, while an important and valuable source of necessary resources for agencies and organizations, all over the world, philanthropy is not \"ser vice\". Volunteerism: Another worthy act of kindness, volunteering addresses, more often than not, a \"one-shot\" task to be completed, often an end -in-itself. Filing papers or other clerical work, building a house, clearing weeds, repairing broken items, or providing immediate, if short -term, help to organizations or agencies. Though generally motivated by charitable or humanistic values, these are optional, and only more or less essential. Volunteerism, per se, does not question values or the relative justi ce or injustice of a particular situation, nor does it necessarily seek to change or serve any but immediate and presenting needs. When a specific task is completed, more often than not, your work is finished. While a good and necessary resource for these organizations, volunteerism is not \"service.\" Service: In Jesuit universities, the understanding of why we exist in the first place centers around an understanding of our purpose and our value, in and to the world. For St. Ignatius, our purpose and our go al derived from faith and nourished our faith. Community service, a means to an end, based on-and deriving from focused reflection, calls us to a longer -term commitment to issues, and a more personal investment than merely completing a task. This understan ding of service calls us into relationships with the people with whom we work and serve, and from whom we also learn --it calls us into a broader community than we normally define as \"my family, my university, my club, or team or organization or activity.\" Service, in this context, calls us to, and prepares us for, a larger life, not just a college life. It also extends to the interrelatedness, the connectedness, of each of us to all of us\u2014as brothers and sisters in Christ, as the Body of Christ. As a result , at Jesuit universities, we focus on \"service\" as a part of \"promoting the faith that seeks justice.\" Learning from Constituents SLU faculty, staff, students and/or alumni gather information from University constituents to learn about their needs and asp irations. We learn intentionally from them through formal means such as surveys and advisory committees, and in less formal ways, even in personal encounters. We reflect on our capacity to respond, whether we do so in small project groups or through depa rtment or center structures. The multiple opportunities for input spark new initiatives, thereby demonstrating institutional capacity and commitment to engage constituents as well as responsiveness to their interests. Overall, we are nimble in our respon se to them because individual units have great latitude in deciding if and how to act on behalf of community members. Through its academic programs, centers for service, clinics, and partnerships, SLU faculty, staff, students, and/or alumni work with com munity groups to identify their needs. At the same time, University members identify internship, practicum, clinical assignments, and service -learning opportunities through which students, undergraduate and graduate alike, can participate in integrative l earning while meeting needs identified by local groups. Examples of dialogue with local groups span the University's undergraduate, graduate, and professional degree programs as well as programs in Student Development. The academic programs link their k nowledge and methods with needs of the communities they serve. Illustrations span the University's colleges, schools, and divisions. 129 Chapter VII: Criterion Five Centers Several centers on the St. Louis campus are committed to service, including the Center for Service Leadership in the Cook School of Business, the Doerr Center for Social Justice in the School of Social Work, as well as the service dimension of the Department of Campus Ministry. Since space does not permit all to be equally described, the focus example here is th e Center for Service and Community Engagement (CSCE) , founded in 2009 based on a 2008 proposal to the Vice President for Academic Affairs to foster communication and collaboration for community -based efforts ac ross the University . Support for the Center is now established in the University's budget for the Division of Student Development . Before 2009, the service -learning function was housed in the Reinert Center for Teaching Excellence (which reports to the Vice President for Academic Affairs) and the volunteer outreach function was housed in the Division of Student Development (reporting to the Director of Student Life). While both programs had a reasonably strong connection to one another, the profiles of the two offices were not high, being embedded in two distinct units. Bringing them together under one department (CSCE) has allowed for greater collaboration, as well as a much higher profile on campus. Also, prior to 2006, the position of director for service -learning was part -time. The rationale for the creation of the CSCE focused on the need to coordinate more effectively the multiple service and community -based activities across multiple units. The CSCE brings together students, faculty, and staff across the University to connect with community partners for service, community -based learning, and research. Its function builds upon previous efforts supported by grant funds. The VOICES Project (funded by the Lily Foundation from 2001 -2009), engaged students and faculty in efforts to promote linking Vocation, Interiority, Community, and Engaged Service. Originally housed in Campus Ministry, VOICES was moved to the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs to promote linkage with the academic units. Before that, the U.S. Department of Education, through its Urban Community Service Program, provided funding to link ten units of the University with three organizations in nearby neighborhoods. Students had the opportunity to practice their skil ls in an interdisciplinary context while serving in projects developed with the community partners. Local Sites at Which SLU Students Mo st Frequently Volunteer American Red Cross Big Brothers Big Sisters Campus Kitchen Casa de Salud Catholic Charities Habitat for Humanity Health Resource Center SLU Hospital SLU Law Clinic St. Louis Crisis Nursery St. Louis Public Schools Urban FUTURE Ment oring Program 130 Chapter VII: Criterion Five The Center's efforts also extend to research. In 2010 the Center worked with the President's Research Fund to support two community -based research proje cts designed to bring University faculty members and community partners together to address an issue framed by the community. One originated when the faculty member visited the Cherokee Indian Hospital Authority where the Executive Director of Clinic Serv ices wanted to be able to track scheduled visits for pregnant women. The project's goal is to educate underserved populations about how to better manage their medical conditions, how technology aids this self -management, and about the technology itself. T he other project focus is to identify barriers to health services use and health concerns among older adults in the local Chinese and Bosnian communities. Both researchers have longstanding relationships with organizations that serve immigrants. Students , faculty, and community agencies have the opportunity to assess CSCE programs. An annual survey of local community agencies aids CSCE staff in identifying needs with which the University can assist. The CSCE then connects the community organizations to SLU faculty members working in those areas. Students, faculty, and community organizations have multiple opportunities to assess the CSCE and its programs. Such opportunities for evaluations include the Community Service Fair, Make a Difference Day eval uation, Service -Learning Meet and Greets, the Community Service Federal Work -Study Program, and the annual Student Survey on Service. The CSCE then uses this information in strategic planning to develop new programs and refine existing ones. The annual C ommunity Organization Survey also is distributed to the over 500 community organizations with whom SLU works in order to effectively assess the needs of the community. Community organizations are able to highlight general service opportunities for our stu dents, as well as service -learning and research opportunities for our faculty. All information is then placed in an online, searchable database of community partners through which our students an d faculty can be connected. Site visits also are conducted as a follow - up with select community partners in order to gain a deeper understanding of the specific needs of that particular organization. Academic Programs Students across the University h ave opportunities to engage in service -learning. There currently are nearly 160 such courses formally identified via the Office of the Registrar. For example, the School for Professional Studies, which offers globally -accessible, academic and professiona l programs for working students, provides a course number for service -learning with enrollment subject to approval of the site and sponsoring faculty member and department chair. Taken in the junior or senior year, the purpose of this course is to provide students with an independent service -learning experience to apply the knowledge and skills they have gained in their major or minor to their community. It is an opportunity for reciprocal learning between the student and an organization, which is the foun dation of the Saint Louis University mission. In this course, students use SLU's service -learning resources to identify an organization and service -learning experience. Students are responsible for identifying the organization, their project area of focus, and a faculty sponsor prior to the start of the term. Students can earn one to four credit hours. There are two outcomes from the service -learning experience. First, the student will produce deliverables for the organization, that are evaluated by the organization. Second, the student will complete a personal reflection paper that connects their experience to their personal and professional development. The goal of the service -learning experience is for students to build upon their knowledge and skills wh ile simultaneously providing a service to an organization. The key to service -learning is the student's reflection on that experience. Service -learning is reciprocal in nature, and is ultimately defined by the student's learning objectives (as approved by the faculty sponsor and program chair). Upon completion of this course, both the organization and the student are to benefit from the experience. An organization receives a set of deliverables, and the student benefits from additional practical experience and personal reflection. Based on information gathered at formal meetings and from survey questionnaires of advisory board members, students, alumni, and faculty as well as at professional meetings, undergraduate and graduate students in the Boeing Instit ute of International Business in the John Cook School of Business developed the 131 Chapter VII: Criterion Five International Business Database for the state of Missouri. The purpose is to assist small - to medium -size companies ini tiate or expand exports , and the effort is supported by seed money from the Boeing Company and a grant from the U.S. Department of Education. The program's advisory board includes representatives from major local/national/international employers, includi ng Boeing, Monsanto, Emerson, Sigma Purina, U. S. Bank, Hellmuth Obata Kassabaum (HOK) Architects, Anheuser Busch -InBev, and Edward Jones . The Board meets four times a year with a subcommittee which meets several times a year. Among other agenda items, they discuss matters relating to curriculum and make recommendations on certain topics (e.g., they suggested enhanced attention to business ethics in the curriculum). In one instance, they suggested having a lecture by a philosophy faculty member on the role of business ethics in international business. They donated money to tape the lecture and produce a DVD. They promoted the DVD and sold it to the advisory board members who, in turn, sold it to their colleagues. Students invol ved in the project learned about the production, editing, and distribution of this product.. The Boeing Center also has partnerships with the St. Louis World Trade Center which helps their members \u2014mostly small - or medium - size firms \u2014who want to start or exp and exports to other countries. SLU students work as interns or do independent study courses for the World Trade Center. The Boeing Center also used graduate assistants to collect and compile international trade data for exporters and foreign direct inves tment in the state of Missouri; the data was distributed free of charge to the member firms of the World Trade Center. Health -Related Clinical Experiences The Communication Sciences and Disorders Clinic in the College of Arts and Sciences serves two gr oups of constituents: the clients seen in the clinic and the students in training to become speech -language pathologists . Community outreach is provided through the participation of students and faculty in a variety of screening and prevention activities at health fairs, community preschools and daycare centers, Head Start, and adult nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities. In addition to these outreach activities, the clinic also provides speech screenings for several public and Catholic schools in t he area. The Speech -Language -Hearing Clinic also runs other special programs each year based on the identified, specific needs of the community. The Clinic is non -profit and has served Saint Louis University and the St. Louis Metropolitan community for more than 40 years. One example of the Department of Family and Community Medicine's service efforts is the 2010 Health Literacy Demonstration Project, based on an extensive community needs assessment and funded through Health Literacy Missouri to support those seeking services through Casa de Salud . Casa de Salud was founded in January 2010 to deliver high quality basic health and wellness services to uninsured a nd underinsured patients, focusing on new immigrants and refugees who encounter barriers to accessing other sources of care. The organization is geared toward Hispanic immigrants, though since its opening Casa has already seen a diverse population of unin sured and underinsured Latinos, whites, eastern European immigrants, and African Americans. Casa's primary mission is to be a portal of entry for the community it serves to receive continuity of care from medical homes such as community health centers tha t are established in the St. Louis community. It does this through health literacy services that allow patients to better understand why they need primary care medical homes and continuous rather than episodic, fragmented care. The Doisy College of Heal th Sciences and the Schools of Nursing, Medicine, and Social Work at Saint Louis University created a unique Interprofessional Education (IPE) program for students in the health professions. The ultimate goal of interprofessional education is building a t eam culture and providing the best possible care for patients, families, and communities. The Integrative Interprofessional Practicum Experience is the final course in the IPE program. It has been designed so that students can apply what they've learned ab out interprofessional team work in a community agency setting. Five or 6 students are assigned to a team representing two or more health professions and then the team is assigned to a community agency. Each team has a faculty advisor. In partnership wit h the agency, the team identifies an issue or need that is relevant to the population served by the agency and the agency's mission. The student team then develops and implements a project that addresses the need or issue. Tasks and activities to complet e the project and meet 132 Chapter VII: Criterion Five the objectives of the course are agreed upon and implemented in collaboration with the IPE practicum faculty advisor and the site coordinator. This practicum experience is a wonderful learning opportunity for students and in return t hey can provide a valuable service to community agencies and the people they serve that we hope will be ongoing. The northern neighborhoods of the city of St. Louis have long suffered from a lack of access to health care, mental health and public health services. Several studies have shown that this population, approximately 98% African American, has a life expectancy of 10 or more years less than citizens living in the southern neighborhoods of the city. Moreover, the health indicators for this populat ion are worse than those for general U.S. African American population. Saint Louis University, with its urban location, Jesuit tradition, mission, commitment to social justice, and history of service to the underserved, is in many ways uniquely positioned to play a leading role in addressing these disparities. Despite the significant investment on the part of the University, community engagement is too often fragmented, uncoordinated, and unfocused. Coordinating these activities through a community -focus ed SLU -led site, or beacon, in north St. Louis could help crystallize these efforts, providing a home for enhanced service -learning activities and a base on which to build future grant efforts and research. The term beacon describes this focus of acti vities within a physical site. The Beacon of Health Program concept originated with a panel presentation by members of the City of St. Louis Board of Aldermen who represent wards on the City's north side. The panel presentation was part of a series orga nized by the School of Public Health (SPH) and sponsored by Pfizer, the world's largest research -based pharmaceutical company, to address health disparities in the northern parts of the City of St. Louis. The SPH Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and the Associate Dean for Curriculum in the School of Medicine shared the concern and recognized that SLU can make a difference for residents in providing services. They have reached out across the University to engage colleagues in this community partnership, presenting the program concept to the Council of Academic Deans and Directors (CADD). The Medical School Associate Dean prepared a brief proposal to the Missouri Foundation for Health to fund a position for two to three years to support the effort. The concept continues to evolve engaging faculty members from multiple disciplines including criminology, education, social work, physical therapy, occupational therapy, law, the Micah Program, nursing, communication sciences and disorders, African American s tudies, and counseling. The Center for Service and Community Engagement (CSCE) will provide support for service -learning, volunteer placements, and community based research. The Beacon of Health program follows on 18 years of SLU medical students running a free clinic in the basement of a north St. Louis church. That clinic, called the Heath Resource Center, provides free care to between 800 -1000 patients each year. The ability of SLU physicians to serve the community will be greatly enhanced when c onstruction of the new, $80M ambulatory care facility is completed in late 2013. The facility will be located directly across the street from the $82 M Doisy Research Center that opened in 2009, and just south of the Saint Louis University Hospital. Educ ation Partnerships A number of K -12 education partnerships showcase SLU's commitment to collaborate with and serve the community. The Professional Development School (PDS) partnership between SLU and Wyman Elementary School just north of the St. Louis cam pus began in the early 1990s and continued until 2009 when the St. Louis Public School District closed the school. Since then, the Department of Education Studies has partnered with Hodgen Elementary School, another St. Louis public school. SLU's Departm ent of Educational Studies regularly evaluates its PDS experience. The 2009 report to the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education noted that the clearest indication of pre -service teacher impact on student learning in grades 1 -6 comes fr om annual evaluation reports generated by the Wyman -Saint Louis University Professional Development School Partnership and the new PDS partnership between the University and Hodgen Elementary School.. Between 2002 and 2009, candidates in the Elementary Education, Early Childhood Education, Early Childhood Special Education, and Middle School programs, 133 Chapter VII: Criterion Five provided between 1500 and 2100 contact hours per academic year to Wyman students in kindergarten through sixth grade. Contact hours represent the interaction of the pre -service teachers and the elementary students. Since beginning the partnership with Hodgen Elementary in 2008 -09, SLU students provided between 1800 and 1900 contact hours to students there. Pre-and post tests of student achievement, surveys an d interviews of SLU faculty, Wyman teachers, and teacher candidates were used to gather information about candidate and faculty impact on student achievement. Over the years, Wyman students showed statistically significant gains in important academic areas as a result of continued and intensive involvement with SLU candidates in the Early Childhood and Elementary Education programs. With input from the school's principal and faculty members, SLU varies the grade focus from year to year, a structural factor that directly shapes what subjects and grades are evaluated. According to the annual evaluations, statistically significant gains on classroom assessments of math skills were consistently noted between 2001 and 2008 among children in the third and fifth g rades who participated in Math Club with Early Childhood and Elementary Education candidates who tutored them in math. Significant gains in math performance also were noted among children in fourth grade and in a combined third-fourth grade class during th e 2003-04 year . In 2006 -07, second graders tutored in math also showed significant gains in math skills. SLU Early Childhood majors worked with second and third graders in math. With regard to language and literacy, consistent gains were noted for each y ear between 2002 and 2006 on pre- and post -test performance on the Scholastic Reading Inventory (SRI) for children in grades 2 -5 who participated in a year -long afterschool literacy program with SLU tutors; the most impressive results were reported in grad es 3 and 5. In addition, students performed at high levels on informal assessments; for example, students in third grade exhibited significant gains on St. Louis Public Schools benchmark assessments in reading according to the results documented in the ann ual evaluation of the PDS. In addition to quantitative information, qualitative evaluation reports also yielded important qualitative data that confirmed teacher candidate impact on student achievement. Each year between 2004 and 2008, statistically sig nificant gains in self -perceived competence were reported by teacher candidates who served as math tutors and who worked with students with disabilities in inclusive settings. Surveys of Wyman faculty and SLU candidates also corroborated the professional development of pre -service teachers as a result of their Wyman experiences. Finally, anecdotal accounts revealed that Wyman students viewed SLU students as role models, talked about going to college when they grew up, and stated how much they loved and e njoyed their SLU tutors. On a questionnaire to the students about what they learned from working with SLU students, Wyman students with special needs answered: that I am a good person, that I can do something good, and how to make new friends. Further, Wy man faculty and administrators as well as parents of Wyman students felt that SLU students had a significant impact on the children at Wyman, not just academically but also socially and behaviorally, often in ways that were not measurable . For example, on e sixth grade teacher had her students write about what they would do if they had $25 to spend. One student wrote that he would put it away to save to go to SLU. The comment is especially meaningful when placed in the context of the student's other basic needs. Another significant education partnership is the 1818 Advanced College Credit (ACC) Program , which offers high achieving high school juniors and seniors the opportunity to earn college credit through Sai nt Louis University while concurrently earning credit toward graduation at their local high school. One of the largest dual credit programs in the nation, and the leading dual credit program locally, 1818 ACC originated in 1959 from a request from two area high schools to assist in providing an accelerated program for high ability, high achieving students. Currently the 1818 ACC Program serves an average 5400 unduplicated students annually in 90 high schools throughout east central Missouri and southwestern Illinois, with three partner high schools in central Iowa. High school teachers holding advanced degrees and approved by the appropriate University departments deliver approved SLU courses on their respective high school campuses. Students in partner high schools have the opportunity of earning transcripted, transferable SLU credit at a cost of approximately 5% of regular University tuition. In addition to the obvious tangible benefit of significant tuition reduction, 1818 ACC offers early exposure and a ccess to college rigor, academic expectation, and campus facilities (e.g., 134 Chapter VII: Criterion Five Pius XII Memorial Library) to participating students. The program director utilizes a variety of qualitative tools (e.g. Current Issues forms, Incentive Awards response letters, Principals' Summit feedback) and an external advisory board to identify on -going needs. The program continually adjusts policies to meet the needs of partner schools' faculties and students as effectively as possible. Examples of patron -initiated benefits include teacher training stipends for attendance at summer training; expanded discipline -specific professional development opportunities and subsidies to schools for the cost of substitute teacher pay to allow for 1818 ACC high school adjunct instructors to attend professional development; institutional scholarships to support preparation of upcoming 1818 ACC high school adjunct instructors; school enhancement awards (financial awards to support program growth in partner schools); and external tuition scholarships for cases in which potential high school instructors cannot complete necessary course work at Saint Louis University. The 1818 ACC Program has long provided each active 1818 ACC high school adjunct instructor up to six hours of graduate tuition s cholarship annually. SLU has extended its service to the K -12 community in St. Louis via sponsorship of charter schools . SLU's sponsorship of three local charter schools was a University -level response to repeated requests from community groups seeking to improve K -12 education in St. Louis via the charter school model. Recognizing and hoping to capitalize on the intellectual capital of SLU's faculty and the vast array of University resources at large, multip le groups seeking to create charters came to the University, unsolicited, seeking SLU's sponsorship. Via a rigorous application review process, a team of SLU faculty and staff were able to identify applicants whose charter proposals called for faculty, sta ff, and students to be engaged in activities that supported multiple facets of the University mission while fostering the growth and excellence of the schools. In terms of ongoing oversight and evaluation, sponsorship responsibilities include: (1) implem enting an accountability system that generates all information needed to assess school performance; (2) monitoring compliance requirements, including academic, organizational, financial, statutory and regulatory requirements; (3) articulating consequences for failing to meet compliance requirements; (4) providing clear, adequate and evidence -based notice of problems; (5) providing professional development assistance; and (6) making decisions about whether and how to intervene in school operations, including decisions regarding the suspension, revocation and/or non -renewal of the charter contract. A regular annual evaluation of the quality and impact of SLU's sponsorship is conducted with each charter school board, identifying ways in which SLU can improve i ts sponsorship and better serve the sponsored schools. For example, a recently released report about charter school quality in Missouri, Delivering on the Promise: How Missouri Can Grow Excellent, Accountable Public Charter Schools , highlighted the University -sponsored City Garden Montessori School for its students' performance on statew ide proficiency exams. Social Work Field Experiences The ability of the School of Social Work to fulfill its mission of educating and professionally socializing future social work practitioners is inextricably linked to the c ommunities in which our students and faculty live, work, and learn. The social work profession emphasizes the need for students and faculty alike to be connected to the community for the purpose of learning from and contributing to the well -being of that community. Both undergraduate and graduate social work degree requirements include the completion of ten-twelve credits (480 to 1000 clock hours, respectively) of community -based field experiences in which an eligible and trained agency -based field instruc tor provides a minimum of one -hour per week of face -to-face field instruction/supervision. In an effort to maintain current knowledge of and engagement in the communities we serve, the School of Social Work strategically and systematically employs multip le processes for gathering input from the professional community to inform and guide curriculum, research, and service. In addition to the evaluations of student performance that are completed by the student's field instructor each semester, data is routin ely collected from students and agency -based field instructors regarding the overall field experience, including the 135 Chapter VII: Criterion Five process of site selection and placement, administrative processes, relevance of the classroom curricula, and support provided by the Schoo l. This data is regularly analyzed and utilized to implement revisions and updates to the field and classroom curricula . On an ongoing basis, data from this range of sources is reviewed and discussed for the purpose of understanding the way s in which the unit is viewed w ithin the communities in which our students are completing practica and later employed. As a result of what is learned from the community, the social work curricula are changed to accommodate that feedback . For example, the School rec eived feedback from practicum sites (who supervise students from multiple schools of social work in the area) that they found it cumbersome, time -consuming and frustrating to attend multiple field instructor orientations, complete multiple forms, etc. Our School of Social Work then formed a collaborative with the programs at Washington University -St. Louis, University of Missouri -St. Louis, and Fontbonne University to provide joint field instructor orientation/training, develop a joint field manual and a j oint organizational/field instructor profile database. Community -based field experiences are but one aspect of the School's engagement with the community. The majority of the faculty of the School are engaged in agency -based and/or agency -driven research and scholarship . In keeping with the philosophy that effective social work practice is driven by evidence (i.e., research and practice wisdom), faculty members subscribe to the position that researchers and teachers have much to learn from the practition ers who practice social work within the community. Agency professionals frequently serve as consultants, collectors of data, and co -investigators/authors on faculty members' research. An example of this research is one of the School's faculty members servi ng on the board of a new non -profit transportation service in St. Charles County, ITNStCharles. She is currently engaged in a research project with the agency that will serve as a community application/validation of a new mobility assessment tool (develop ed in collaboration with a research partner at the University of Missouri -St. Louis). At the same time, the new tool is helping the agency to develop their intake and assessment process. Core Component 5b The organization has the capacity and the c ommitment to engage with its identified constituencies and communities. The University's capacity and commitment to engage is visible in the extent and diversity of examples across the institution showing how staff, faculty, students, and alumni serve th eir communities. Saint Louis University's Campus Kitchen is a national 501(c)(3) organization based in Washington, D.C. Through a memorandum of understanding, SLU offers in -kind donations and support, in the form of space, volunteers, University oversight via the Center for Service and Community Engagement (CSCE), maintenance and upkeep, marketing, along with several other methods. Campus Kitchen on the University's St. Louis campus utilizes over 650 s tudent volunteers to cook and deliver over 32,500 meals each year to those in need. Campus Kitchen works with local social service agencies and housing authorities to identify potential clients. The University allows the Kitchen to operate in campus space, worth an estimated $36,866.73 in space and amenities according to a 2009 Campus Kitchens report. Letters of support, student reflections, and thank -yous from clients provide evidence of its effectiveness. The first Campus Kitchen was piloted in 2001 o n SLU's campus; since then, 32 schools across the country have adopted Campus Kitchens. SLU's Kitchen remains the largest in the nation, in terms of output (2,500+ meals per month), volunteers (650+), and programs. The impact on the community is tremendo us. Beyond the outputs of 2,500 meals per month and over 70,000 pounds of food rescued and recycled each year, the Kitchen provides direct meal support for well over 150 families, people with disabilities, and older adults. Additionally, three homeless s helters in the area (Our Lady's Inn, YWCA Transitional Housing Program, and 136 Chapter VII: Criterion Five Fr. Dempsey's Charities) are the recipients of hundreds of meals each week which, in turn, saves their organization thousands of dollars every month. The Doerr Center for Social Justice Education and Research promotes social justice through educational events and forums, student scholarship assistance, and the funding of collaborative research projects . The Center is yet another resource and example of our institutional nimbleness in responding to the community. Housed in SLU's School of Social Work, it is supported both internally via University funds, as well as externally through an endowme nt. Recognizing that input is valued from all its stakeholders, the Center also operates an advisory board made up of faculty, staff, students, and community partners dedicated to the pursuit of social justice. The Bright Ideas Grant Program within the Division of Student Development encourages students to become social entrepreneurs. Between 2008 and 2010, $13,000 of Bright Ideas Grant money has supported ten student projects designed to tackle concerns of the elderly, homeless, and youth in St. Louis. The Bright Ideas Program is funded both internally and externally through a partnership among Student Development, the United Way of Greater St. Louis, and the Coleman Foundation. The grant provides funds of up to $2,000 to a student or group of students who have an idea for a social venture or other program that will benefit the community. Also supported by the Division of Student Development are 21 chartered student organizations with a particular emp hasis on service, community engagement, and social justice. One such organization is Alpha Phi Omega which, through its basic tenets of service, leadership, and fellowship, educates its members on the importance of community engagement, and forms them int o servant leaders ready to make a difference. SLU's chapter of this national organization has well over 350 members, making it the largest in the nation, per capita. SLU's Center for Entrepreneurship, housed in the John Cook School of Business, adminis ters a focused, community -based investment program called the Billiken Angels Network . The goal of the Network is to identify and invest funds and expertise in those businesses that can make difference in the e conomy of the St. Louis region, and in the lives of the people living in the region. The Angels of the network are local investors who commit capital for the express purpose of helping develop local entrepreneurship via investment and education. Coun tless other examples of SLU's service capacity and commitment come from the University's many outreach clinics, which provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to engage in clinical work under the direction of experienced faculty profes sionals, and to serve the community at little or no cost in doing so. These clinics include the following: Center for Counseling and Family Therapy (Department of Counseling and Family Therapy/ College of Educa tion and Public Service) Legal Clinics (School of Law) Occupational Therapy Pediatric Faculty Practice (Department of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy/Doi sy College of Health Sciences) Psychological Services Center (Department of Psychology/College of Arts and Sciences) Speech -Language -Hearing Clinic (Department of Commu nication Sciences and Disorders/College of Arts and Sciences) Center for Advanced Dental Education Clinic (Center for Advanced Dental Education) 137 Chapter VII: Criterion Five Academic programs Operating on the St. Louis campus since the mid -1990s, the Micah Program is an undergraduate, faith-based, residential learning community dedicated to examining long-term solutions to urban problems and to advancing social justice by serving among the urban poor. The program has three goals: (1) to pr omote interdisciplinary study of cycles of poverty, Hispanic immigration, and theories of social justice; (2) to participate in model long -term service projects that put into practice what we learn from such study; and (3) to foster leadership and a close -knit support community among those involved. Students of all faiths and all majors are welcome to participate. Housed within the College of Arts and Sciences, the program has seen tremendous growth over the years, tripling the number of its students at all levels to a total of nearly 200. Micah freshmen are required to complete at least 30 hours of service each semester. The Micah Certificate in Urban Social Analysis requires 120 hours of service prior to graduation. The University provides funding fo r up to 21 trips by van a week for service. The program staff includes a full -time program coordinator who oversees the programs operations and coordinates the students' service needs including site assignment, scheduling, and transportation. Even so, it s overall program budget grew only from $4500 in 2002 to $8775 in 2011. The Service Leadership Certificate Program provides students in the John Cook School of Business the opportunity to develop and hone their leadership skills while serving the St. Lou is community. By volunteering at service sites such as Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, Campus Kitchen or one of the many other available sites, students practice critical thinking, decision making, effective communication an d team building, all skills that will help them become more effective future business leaders. The program reflects a balance of academic and service requirements. Students are required to complete four core classes, attend 24 select workshops and speak er presentations, and complete 300 service hours, all in a four -year period. Each year, there are over 200 students enrolled in the Service Leadership Certificate Program. One of the program's initiatives is the Social Justice Computing Project . A group of program students solicits area employers and individuals for gently used computers and related equipment that is just several years old. Once received, the computers loaded with the open -source Linux oper ating system and donated to low - Praise for SLU's Legal Clinics \"Because of the Clinic's services, we were able to help many clients attain the housing and jobs that have, until now, been denied them. ...Saint Louis County families have benefited greatly from all of the s ervices the Law Clinic Provides.\" -- Anne Hardee, Homeless Services Specialist, Department of Human Services, Saint Louis County \"Congratulations on your victory... You saved a lot of lives.\" -- John Garvey, Jr., Circuit Judge, Twenty -Second Judicial Circuit of Missouri \"I have seen your clinic directly involved...in the Supreme Court, and I have also seen first -hand the tremendous services you and the clinic provide the students. Your wonderful clinic is a great educational tool and great opportunit y to instill in students the imperative of supporting equal access to justice.\" -- Rick Teitelman, Judge, Supreme Court of Missouri 138 Chapter VII: Criterion Five income students from the Midtown area, supporting their education. The idea for the program grew out of conversations between colleagues engaged in a year -long seminar on the Jesuit mission for SLU administrators. The semi nar, jointly developed by SLU's Vice President for Mission and Ministry and a faculty member in the College of Education and Public Service, brought together mid -level faculty and staff administrators to learn about and employ the Jesuit mission in their d aily work. The Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders has received substantial new resources in the past three years to meet the challenge of serving persons with speech and hearing disorders in the St. Louis metropolitan area as well as t he students in training. The resources include increases in the number of clinical faculty, advanced equipment and materials, an electronic record keeping system, and a web -based interactive audiovisual system to enable students to improve their self evalu ation skills in therapy. Persons with communication disorders face substantial barriers participating in life. As part of its commitment to serving these individuals, the Speech -Language -Hearing Clinic has a sliding fee scale so that no one is turned away because of limited financial resources. For 2010, the Clinic provided the equivalent of $130,000 worth of free or reduced services. This amount is more than the Clinic's net revenues, indicative of its commitment to the underserved. Thus, the Clinic func tions as a crucial provider of speech, language and hearing services for those in need for the metropolitan St. Louis region. Capacity and commitment to serve also includes the judicious decision -making about where programs or initiatives fit and will b e most effectively supported in the institution. For example, t he decision to administratively house and conduct St. Louis charter sponsorship activities in the Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs was a conscious one, designed to ensure long -term, University -wide support of sponsored schools. (Sponsorship minimally requires commitments of 5 -10 years per school, and requires notable investment of University funds prior to and in addition to receipt of state funds to help offset sponsorship ex penses.) The Office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs is best situated to tap the expertise of faculty and staff from throughout the institution to engage in and support sponsorship efforts. The Office also has established relationships with civi c leaders who are key stakeholders in the quest for K -12 success in St. Louis. Two Office staff members are committed to the charter school sponsorship efforts, with a graduate assistant to help with those efforts. Seeking grant funding is another way SL U ensures its capacity to extend its portfolio of community engagement initiatives. Students in the Maplewood Richmond Heights School District are likely to eat healthier as local farmers get an economic boost, thanks to a $248,000 \"farm to school\" grant to Saint Louis University. The Missouri Foundation for Health is supporting the HELP \u2014or Healthy Eating with Local Produce \u2014program with an \"innovative funding\" grant, which underwrites initiatives that tackle an old problem in a new way. Saint Louis Univer sity's multi -faceted grant is designed to improve school lunches and teach business skills in the Maplewood Richmond Heights District, which has half of its students receiving free or reduced priced lunches. \"While providing children with healthy food at s chool is a monumental challenge, it's well worth the effort,\" according to the chair of the Department of Nutrition and Dietetics in SLU's Doisy College of Health Sciences. \"One of our goals is to hook children on eating locally grown fruits and vegetables . We've devised a plan to get produce from the farm to the school, which benefits the local economy while providing food in its peak of flavor. We're fighting pediatric obesity as we increase business for local farmers and keep dollars in the region.\" By t he end of the three -year grant, 20% of the food served by the school district will come from local farmers. That food will be sliced, diced, and cooked in a converted industrial kitchen on the SLU campus. The food then will be delivered to Maplewood Richmo nd Heights, where it will be served as part of lunches at the district's early childhood center, elementary, middle and high schools. The goal is to help the Maplewood Richmond Heights School District create a healthy school lunch program that will endure long after the three -year grant has ended. The program is supported by the academic department beyond the administration of the grant money; twelve faculty and staff members have devoted more than 350 hours of department time to the project, and the Univer sity has allocated an additional amount of money for its support. 139 Chapter VII: Criterion Five Alumni Another key expression of Saint Louis University's capacity and commitment is its extensive base of service - minded alumni. From serving at food banks across the nation, to mentorin g youth (particularly providing role models for young African Americans), to helping to weatherize homes of the poor and elderly, SLU alumni have continued to serve as model men and women for others long after their days on campus are over. And each year , over 100 local alumni participate in Make a Difference Day alongside members of the current St. Louis campus community. Whether they remain in the St. Louis area, or they are a part of one of our 26 alumni clubs around the country \u2014some of which partner in service with other Jesuit university alumni clubs \u2014our alumni have stepped forward to continue SLU's service mission in ways that suit both their academic pursuits as well as their Jesuit spirit of service. A service component is also included in s everal of the most popular alumni social events of the year. At the annual Breakfast with Santa for children of alumni, over 1000 toys are collected for local children's charities. To celebrate the 100th birthday of our Billiken mascot, alumni collected over 750 children's books for Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital. And for Homecoming, alumni are asked to help stock the pantry and provide desperately needed staples for the Campus Kitchen project . And each year, dozens of our new graduates opt to forgo graduate school or the immediate pursuit of a job, and instead volunteer a year of their lives to service. Organizations for which our students regularly work include AmeriCorps, the Peace Corps, Jesuit Vo lunteer Corps, and Teach for America. Of the graduating class of 2011, 13 SLU graduates joined the Jesuit Volunteer Corps ; 29 joined AmeriCorps. All of the examples above evidence capacity in many ways. How ever, we currently lack a formalized institutional process to set priorities among the multiple initiatives as well as to assess effectiveness. Only the annual budget ing process provides institutional context in which to weigh competing initiatives. And while members of the SLU community engage in multiple service and service -learning efforts, each has its own assessment process. N o general University standards or evaluation process exist . The University's updated Strategic Plan , adopted in Fall 201 1, is designed to provide a framework in which such prioritization of competing, service -centered initiatives can be conducted. Likewise, the Plan's requirement that academic and support programs implement comprehensive assessment efforts should also be very helpful. The success with which the planning process is implemented University -wide will likely dictate the trajectory of improvement on this front. Through his establishment of a faculty task force charged to develop standards to assess faculty perf ormance in areas including professional and community service, the Vice President for Academic Affairs has taken a productive step in that direction. Core Component 5c The organization demonstrates its responsiveness to those constituencies that dep end on it for service. Responsiveness to University constituencies takes many forms. Internally, SLU is responsive to the large and growing population of students, faculty, and staff seeking service and service -learning opportunities. At the same time, the University is responsive to the external constituencies who benefit from the involvement of those students, faculty, and staff. For example, the Center for Community Service and Engagement (CSCE) reaches out to students, faculty, staff, and communi ty agencies in multiple ways: through its website, campus events, and service activities. Agencies complete their survey of needs to be included in the CSCE database. Students looking for service opportunities identify their options, and then staff follo w up within two to three weeks and again at the end of each term to seek feedback and assess the quality of the service experience. 140 Chapter VII: Criterion Five The 2009 National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) results showed that SLU students are more engaged than their peers at both Jesuit and research institutions in terms of community service, volunteering, internships, practica, clinical, and field experiences. This high level of commitment to service is especially evidenced in the tremendous levels of participation amongst our students. Preliminary results from the 2010 - 2011 Student Survey on Service indicate that 84% of respondents volunteered at least once during the academic year. This figure is significantly higher than the 2005 rate (30.2%) among all college students nationwide, as reported by the National Corporation for Community Service. It is also more than double the rate for college students who attend peer research universities nationwide (40%), as measured by the 2010 National Survey on Student Engagement . This commitment to service by our students is also deep and ongoing; 47% of respondents engaged in service at least twice a month. The creation of Casa de Salud , a new health and wellness center, also illustrates th e University's responsiveness. In 2010, j ust one year after two clinics serving Hispanic immigrants in the St. Louis region closed their doors, Casa de Salud celebrated its grand opening. It all started when a SLU trustee asked SLU's President if SLU w ould sponsor a new wellness service for the Latino community. The President embraced the opportunity to take a leadership role, saying he immediately knew this was something that Saint Louis University needed to be part of. This initiative fits with ou r social justice mission of reaching out to help a seldom or never -served portion of our community. We care about our neighbors and our community, and we especially care about those in need. Casa de Salud fits into everything that SLU is about and provid es students, faculty and staff with volunteer opportunities.\" Casa de Salud's Board President (that same member of SLU's Board of Trustees) agreed, noting, If we can offer new immigrants a pathway to good health, we'll help our entire community be strong er and more vibrant. A culturally diverse and healthy workforce is critical if we are to attract new businesses to the St. Louis region. We see Casa de Salud \u2014which means \"house of health\" \u2014as a bridge to good health and regional prosperity.\" SLU quickly converted one of its nearby buildings into a health care center, which it rents to Casa de Salud for $1 a year. In its first year, Casa treated approximately 1400 patients. In collaboration with the SLU Department of Family and Community Medicine, Casa ha s obtained a grant from Health Literacy Missouri to develop (1) a patient navigator program to assist clients' seamless transition into additional, more specialized health care systems; and (2) a community health worker program to provide health education to the Latino community. Students from both SLU and Washington University in St. Louis collaboratively work on this health literacy project. Indeed, Casa is already expanding in size and increasing its impact on the community it serves, as recognized in a June 29, 2011, article in the St. Louis Post -Dispatch . In addition to exten sive support of Casa de Salud, SLU's Department of Family and Community Medicine has developed a new family medicine residency program to train family physicians to work in community health centers. New leadership in the University's School of Medicine rea lized that St. Louis was lacking a training program that provided primary care physicians with a passion for caring for the underserved. The chairman of the department met with leaders of the St. Louis health care safety net and developed a relationship wi th a community health center and a community hospital to develop a new training program with a focus on underserved and vulnerable populations. They recently received a sizable grant from a local philanthropic health organization to support the startup cos ts of this program, which began operations in July 2011. The faculty of SLU's School of Law evidence their responsiveness to community need on a daily basis through their legal clinics and other public servic e programs. For example, law faculty and students annually provide more than 39,000 hours of free legal service \u2014totaling an estimated $3.9 million in in -kind donations \u2014to the community. In addition, law students assist Legal Services of Eastern Missouri attorneys based at the Cardinal Glennon and St. Louis Children's hospitals and the Grace Hill Child Development Center, to represent children and families with various legal needs, including landlord -tenant matters, Social Security benefits, and special e ducation advocacy. Under supervision, students also work at The SPOT, a medical clinic for teens, to address legal needs such as delinquency, municipal court charges, name changes, 141 Chapter VII: Criterion Five and education issues. Lives are demonstrably transformed for the better through the efforts and expertise of the faculty and students of the law school's clinics. In addition, thanks to generous support from SLU School of Law faculty, staff, and alumni, the School established in 2010 the SLU Law PLUS (Practicing Lawyers Unifi ed in Service) Program. This service outreach program annually funds 20 recent SLU law school graduates in part -time, 12 -week public service positions with judiciary, public interest, nonprofit and governmental agencies. SLU's responsiveness to the comm unity is also evidenced via the University's commitment to urban development and neighborhood stabilization in its Midtown St. Louis location. Physically, the University's St. Louis campus spans some 140 buildings on 284 acres. Through its leadership, SL U has served as developer, steward of its own resources, and partner in numerous public and private efforts supporting the Midtown area. According to Cummings, et al., in University Involvement in Downtown Revitalization (Perry & Wiewel, 2005, pp. 147 -174), The direct real estate activities of SLU...have been the most important to the revitalizati on of [St. Louis'] Central Corridor. ...Between 1980 and 2002 approximately $1.76 billion was invested in the Midtown area... [with] an estimated $300 million by SLU . Recent projects include Chaifetz Ar ena, the new (2008) home for Billiken men's and women's basketball and volleyball that also hosts concerts, family shows, sporting events, trade shows, and other events. The Arena complex consists of a 10,600 -seat Arena, athletics practice facility and o ffices and support facilities for all Division I sports and the Department of Athletics. Construction of the Chaifetz Arena was funded through fundraising and $8 M in tax increment financing and bonds, which will be paid back with revenues from the Arena . Hotel Ignacio, a b outique -style hotel, was a collaborative effort with local developer The Lawrence Group, with which SLU has partnered on several area revitalization projects. The hotel opened in early 2011 across the street from SLU's campus, and prov ides upscale lodging for the Grand Center Arts District's patrons as well as visitors to Chaifetz Arena. Still another project is, a new SLU -managed residence located across from Reinert Hall on Grand Blvd. The units are housed in what had been an abando ned office and warehouse that was purchased and renovated by University Plaza LLC. University Plaza owns the property while SLU manages the residential living program there. In addition to the revenue generated for both the partnering developer and SLU, this facility keeps 300 students in the area and increases the amount of spending at local businesses. SLU's commitment to community engagement and service also extends throughout its campuses. For example, students at the Madrid campus travel to Zway , Ethiopia to volunteer as language teachers. For over a decade, the SLU Community ESL program has trained SLU Madrid student volunteers to teach conversational English. The Madrid campus was also approached by local Jesuit high schools to set up summer English language camps, resulting in the now long -standing Operacion Ingles program. As faculty in Madrid more frequently integrate service -learning opportunities into coursework, both the Office s of Student Life and Campus Ministry in Madrid are creating additional opportunities near campus and throughout the city to advance SLU's service -oriented institutional missi on. SLU's student -athletes participate in many of the same community service activities as other SLU students do. An activity distinctive to the Department of Athletics, however, is the Billiken Caravan , which supports public appearances throughout the St. Louis metropolitan area by team members, coaches, and athletics administrators. These appearances include hospital visits, sports clinics, mentoring programs, and speaking engagements in local elementary and secondary schools. 142 Chapter VII: Criterion Five Core Component 5d Internal and external constituencies value the services the organization provides. The value of SLU's service to the community is measured in multiple ways. Results of the 2011 SLU Community Organization Survey, conducted by the Center for Service and Community Engagement (CSCE), reported a 100% satisfaction rate with volunteers and services provided. Numerous letters of support and appreciation from community organizations affirm these results. Typical of the sentiments expressed is this statement from staff of UrbanFUTURE , a Missouri non -profit sponsor of social outreach programs for St. Louis urban youth: Some of our best volunteers came from SLU this year. We really appreciate the commitment to volun teerism and justice that the school, its students and staff have. We have come to expect a high quality of volunteers from SLU, and we have not been disappointed! The impact of the work by students and faculty of SLU's Speech -Language -Hearing Clinic i n the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders is captured through various means, including client surveys of service quality and unsolicited letters of appreciation. In addition, the faculty often are called upon for consultation on an as -neede d basis by urban and rural school districts, other facilities, special interest groups, and individuals in the community. The leadership of a local school, many of whose students come from challenged socioeconomic backgrounds, said this about the departme nt's efforts to help develop higher level language and pre -literacy skills in the school's pre -school and kindergarten children: \"... [the members of the] Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders have been instrumental in the planning and implement ation of our school's Excellence Early program. In this program we are trying to support the parents of at -risk students ages 0 - 5, so that they can raise their children to be the most successful students possible. Without [them] \u2014both their expertise and their willingness to roll up their sleeves and help \u2014we would never have gotten this program off the ground.\" External constituents of the 1818 Advanced College Credit (ACC) Program document their views in letters they send in response to Incentive A wards . The Program also receives unsolicited letters and emails from students, parents, and partner school officials. Impact studies for external constituencies are under development. In 2010, SLU's School of Nursing, in collaboration with the Area Health Education Center (AEHC) Program in SLU's Department of Family and Community Medicine, received a $900,000 grant from the Health Resources Ser vices Administration to develop a more diverse nursing workforce. They are Award for SLU Relay for Life The Saint Louis University Relay for Life was recently awarded the \"Thanks a Million\" awa rd by the American Cancer Society. This award honors Relay for Life events that have raised $1M cumulatively. SLU's Relay for Life began in 2004, and since then has raised more than $1.25M, which has been given to the American Cancer Society for Eastern Missouri. \"The neat thing about our Relay for Life program is that it's totally planned and facilitated by students,\" said Bobby Wassel, assistant director of the Center for Service and Community Engagement. \"It just shows that when students are empowered , they can do some amazing things.\" \"We are very proud of the volunteers, participants, and donors at Saint Louis University,\" said Stephanie Hadfield, development officer for the American Cancer Society. \"It's amazing to think that over the years every l ittle bit does add up. To say we have raised 1.25 million to help fight cancer is a tremendous accomplishment. Congratulations to everyone who has worked so hard over the years to make SLU's Relay For Life successful.\" 143 Chapter VII: Criterion Five partnering with the St. Louis Archdiocese to work with area Catholic high schools that regularly graduate minority or disadvantaged students who continue their education. The progr ams created through this grant will educate the students about nursing career opportunities, enhance their academic preparation, and, hopefully attract them to SLU to pursue nursing or other health -related careers. Both this award and the dean of the nurs ing school were recognized by The St. Louis American , the long -established newspaper of the area's African American community. The service commitment of Saint Louis University students, faculty, and staff garners regular national recognition as well. For four consecutive years (2007 -2010), SLU has been honored with a place on the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll ; in 2009, SLU was named to the exclusive With Distinction list. Most recently, the 2011 university rankings in the Washington Monthly rated the University second nationwide for student engagement in community service. Also in 2009, SLU \u2014especially its Micah Pr ogram \u2014was recognized as a top best neighbor university by the Saviors of Our Cities: A Survey of Best College and University Civic Partnerships , for its extensive and creative engagement with community organizations near campus. Micah Program evaluati ons provided by students and service sites show the program's very positive influence on the lives of its students and the people they serve. One student reflected on the relationships formed with other students through the program in this way: I have le arned more this past year in and out of Micah courses than I probably have my whole life - I think it's invaluable to have those courses and the people that you know and have them challenge you to think no matter how much you put up a fight. . . . The Mi cah Program receives donations from supporters who believe in its mission and appreciate the positive impact on students and their service sites . The program also has been consulted as a model for learning communities and service -learning initiatives, bo th at SLU as well as at other universities (e.g., Creighton, St. Thomas, and Baylor). The quality and integrity of the University's efforts to enhance area educational opportunities through its charter school sponsorship is recognized by civic leaders' reliance upon SLU to take an even greater leadership role. Their confidence is inspired by the guidance SLU provides around, for example, curriculum development and compliance. Recognition of SLU's charter school sponsorship has come even from other charter schools; SLU's director of charter sponsorship was invited to join the board of a non -SLU sponsored school. Recognition at the state level is demonstrated by the invitation by the Missouri State Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) to SLU charter sponsorship staff to serve on a DESE panel to evaluate charter grant applications from across the state. As is well known, charter schools are controversial, and SLU's success in this domain is not universally lauded. Internally and exte rnally, some question SLU's involvement in charter schools. In fact, the faculty in SLU's College of Education and Public Service (CEPS) are not united in support of the University's involvement. Some of this dissension steps from concern that SLU's supp ort will negatively impact its long-standing support of STL's traditional public schools. Additionally, because some in the STL community contend that the existence of charters necessarily impedes success in traditional public schools, they sometimes blam e SLU's sponsorship of charters as contributing to the serious problems experienced by the St. Louis Public Schools. \"Service at SLU helps me remind myself that the world is bigger than me. I have been blessed with certain opportunities. I need to bless someone else. \" -- SLU Student Leader 144 Chapter VII: Criterion Five The SLU Newslink Daily Update, Universitas alumni magazine, and the many newsletters of the University's academic and operating units ar e replete with mentions of the achievements of the institution's faculty, staff, students, and alumni. Awards and other recognitions accorded members of the SLU community in the context of their SLU roles are an indirect means of gauging the institution's impact on its varied constituents and, to some extent, is reflective of its success in fulfilling its mission. Finally, in February 2012, SLU contracted with an independent research firm to conduct a comprehensive economic impact study designed to assess the economic impact of the University on the Midtown, St. Louis City, and regional communities. Results of the study are to help SLU better understand how the University is meeting community needs and assess the impact of the University's multiple invest ments in their constituents. Magis : Recommendations It is clear that SLU's mission engages students, faculty, staff, and alumni in service to multiple constituents. Their commitment permeates the institution , providing multiple ways for the needs and aspirations of constituents to be heard and addressed. The decentralized nature of the University supports nimble responsiveness, omitting unwieldy multiple layers of approval. While this structure is a major asset for serving constituents, there are associated challenges. Nimble and decentralized response can lead to overlapping projects and unnecessary competition for scarce resources, especially when longer term commitment is sought. Some system for identifying or even registering the multiplicity of efforts would be useful to support coordination along with basic institutional standards. The ambiguity of institutional process es for setting shared prioriti es, while a challenge , does reflect the University's strong and growing interest a nd engagement in service , which then challenges us to continually adapt organizationally . The implementation of the University Strategic Plan should provide clarity and coordination of priorities, while not unduly restricting responsiveness. Committees a lready formed by the Vice President for Academic Affairs to identify ways to assess faculty teaching, research, and service activity are a step in this dire ction. The purpose of such strategic efforts in relation to Criterion Five is to coordinate, priori tize, and assess service and engagement capacity and commitments, and to document their outcomes and impact for the communities we serve, as well as for our learners and faculty. Related recommendations include : Recommendation Strategic Plan Implementati on Employ results of the University Economic Impact Study (to be completed by July 2012) to modify community service/support initiatives; establish new goals for community impact based on study results. Strategic Direction D: Continue Campus and Communit y Development Critical Success Factor 3: Clinical Quality and Sustainability Index Critical Success Factor 4: Campus Infrastructure and Environment Index Develop a plan (including goals, supportive resources, etc.) to increase grants to support - community -based research. Strategic Direction A: Improve Academic and Research Performance and Reputation Strategic Direction D: Continue Campus and Community Development Critical Success Factor 1: Academic and Research Index Chapter VIII Conclusion 146 Chapter VIII: Conclusion Chapter VIII: Conclusion Concluding Statement While we believe Saint Louis University has met the letter of the Higher Learning Commission's requirement for a comprehe nsive self-study, more importantly we believe we have met th e spirit of that requirement. As evidenced by the exhaustive lists of faculty, staff , and students in Chapter I who participated in the Self-Study process, this has truly been a shared experience \u2014one in which we shared in the call to live Ignatian pedag ogy via extensive reflection and critical self -evaluation. As teams researched and began writing their respective sections of this report, it became increasingly evide nt to an increasingly larger portion of SLU 's community that SLU is b oth an outstanding university and one that is still growing, still developing, still seeking the Magis . Throughout this Self-Study is echoed a call for consistency and follow -through in our implementation of the FY20 13-2017 University Strategic Plan . That call embodies a collective willingness to do more so that, as a community, we will be more to the community. Our understanding of that call has been significantly enhanced and illuminated by this Self-Study . Accor dingly, Saint Louis Univer sity now stands poised to advance its mission into its third century . Request for Continued Accreditation Based on the evidence provided in this Self -Study and the addit ional evidence provided to the site visit team through our electronic resource room, Saint Louis University formally requests continued accreditation by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.
