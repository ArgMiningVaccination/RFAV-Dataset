Glucosinolates have also been shown to reduce the risk of developing certain neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease1.Research has demonstrated that MSM may reduce inflammation and decrease joint and muscle pain2 A randomized, double-blind study found that individuals with osteoarthritis-associated knee pain experienced a reduction in pain and had improved joint function following 12 weeks of MSM supplementation, administered twice daily. Compared to placebo, MSM produced significant decreases in WOMAC pain and physical function impairment (P<0.05). WOMAC stands for Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index visual analogue scale. MSM also produced improvement in performing activities of daily living when compared to placebo on the SF-36 evaluation (P<0.05)3. MSM-sulfur may also have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, contributing to its potential anti-cancer benefits. Studies have shown that MSM-sulfur may help boost immune function and induce cancer cell death in colon, gastrointestinal, and liver cancers. Glutathione, a powerful antioxidant that supports immune function and protects cells from inflammation, requires sulfur for its synthesis and structure. Research has shown that supplementing with MSM and eating plenty of sulfur-containing foods may increase glutathione levels and encourage the upregulation of glutathione enzyme activity, as well as reduce oxidative stress that can lead to cancer4. MSM-sulfur may form bonds essential to strengthening the keratin in hair and influencing hair growth. 2Methylsulfonylmethane: Applications and Safety of a Novel Dietary Supplement, PMC, March 16, 2017,Butawan M, Benjamin RL, Bloomer RJ.

Reactive Sulfur Compounds in the Fight Academic Editor, which Artemisinin and Ivermectin are made. There are many types of Artemisia. Ivermectin is made from Artemisin, which is in Artemisia Annua, but also in other types of Artemisia. This article is to get an idea of the many types and uses of Artemisia. The genus Artemisia consists of hardy plants that are rich in volatile oils. The plants in this genus range from tall shrubs to dwarf herbaceous plants. All members of this genus have alternative leaves small capitula, and tubular florets. They occur as racemose, pendant, paniculate, or capitate inflorescences. Rarely do they occur solitary. The leaves of Artemisia are fern-like and are covered with white hair. Artemisias are found growing in temperate climates of Southern Hemisphere and Northern Hemisphere. They are commonly found in areas where there is a dry or semi-dry climate. Artemisia offers a huge variety of herbs for herb lovers. They make outstanding ornamentals for the gardens and are also mainstays for craft shops. Artemisia species make beautiful herb gardens with their attractive foliage. Although there are so many varieties of Artemisia, most of them do not have any showy flowers. Most of the species in the genus Artemisia have white or yellow colored flowers except for some exceptions. There are not many types of Artemisia flowers, however, there are many types of Artemisia that are more commonly known and more widely used than others. Artemisia genus consists of plants that are annuals, biennials, and perennials. Many species of Artemisia are woody or semi-woody. Some species are invasive, have creeping rootstocks. They have superb foliage that comes in numerous shapes like ferny, lobed, delicately lacy, or broadly strap-shaped. The colors of the foliage range from dark green to silver and grays, at times, sparkling white as well. The species with green foliage have smoother leaves while the gray species have woolly, hairy, or felted leaves. Some of the most popular types of Artemisias have been listed down below. Some of the Artemisia species are ornamentals while some have traditional herbal uses. 1. Southernwood (Artemisia abrotanum) Southernwood is a sturdy shrublet that is native to southern Europe. They usually grow up to 3 feet or taller. The stems are yellowish-green and have an upright habit of growth. Southernwood has gray-green, aromatic leaves which are finely dissected into segments that are threadlike. The leaves remain fresh throughout the summer season. Its shapeliness can be maintained by pruning the plants hard in spring. They can be trained to form a low hedge. Flowers of Southernwood are yellow-white in the color that blooms from late summer to fall. They grow in loose panicles. The flowers are small, nodding and inconspicuous. Southernwood can be propagated by layering. The branch is pinned down and covered with soil. When the formations of roots begin, the rooted part is severed from the mother plant. The new plant is left undisturbed after the procedure until next spring, after which the plant can be moved to another location. It attracts spittlebugs and tiny insects whose larvae reside in froth globs that are attached to the leaves of Southernwood, from where they feed on plant juices. Wormwood is native to temperature North Africa and Eurasia. This type of Artemisia grows 2 to 4 feet tall. It has gray-green leaves that have a silky texture. The leaves are cut like that of carrot. It is well known for its anthelmintic character (a potent vermifuge) and as an important ingredient of absinthe liqueur. Although its leaves have a bitter taste, slugs still feed on them. Wormwood flowers are pale yellow in color. they are tubular and are clustered in spherical heads that are bent down. These spherical flower-heads are clustered in branches panicles that are leafy. The flowers bloom from early summer to early autumn. Lambrook Silver is a cultivar of common Wormwood that is silver. It grows to a height of 3 feet. It is extremely beautiful. It can be planted in front of a red brick wall or adjacent to plants that have red foliage to make a breathtaking sight. Powis Castle is another cultivar of Wormwood that has silver colored, feathery leaves. Its leaves are finer as compared to Wormwood. Powis Castle is most probably a hybrid between latter species of Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) and Artemisia arborescens, which is evergreen Mediterranean species. It is not hardy beyond zone 6 but it can be wintered indoors. Wormwood has a history if being used as a medicinal herb. It is poisonous in large quantities. It can cause convulsions, insomnia, and nervous disorders even in small quantities. This is due to the presence of thujone which is a brain stimulant, causing toxicity in excess. The smell of Wormwood is strong enough to onset headaches and nervousness. Western Mugwort is native to American West. It has erect stems and grows up to 3 feet in height. Its cultivars have silver leaves that make it valuable for dried arrangements and wreaths. They look stunning with pink colored flowers. their silver foliage is what makes them so popular. Silver King is one of the cultivars of Western Mugwort. Upper stems have narrow leaves that are quite pale while the leaves on the lower part of the stems are more jagged and broader. Silver Queen is a grayer cultivar of Western Mugwort. Its leaves are broader than the Silver King. Valerie Finnis is another cultivar that is less known to herb growers. It is more elegant and neat than Silver King and Silver Queen. It is an upright plant which has leaves that are green-gray on the top and white on the lower side. The leaves that are lower on the stems are slightly woolly and greener in color. The flowers of Western Mugwort are insignificant. They are used as ornamentals because of their sparkling, silver leaves. Western Mugwort is a low maintenance plant that requires full sun for proper growth. It grows best in areas where the soil is sandy and well-drained. Their water requirements are low to medium. 4. White Mugwort (Artemisia lactiflora) White Mugwort is a Chinese native plant that has erect, yellow-green colored stems. The plant can grow to a height of 6 feet. The leaves of White Mugwort are deeply cut, green in color, and lobed. From late summer to fall, White Mugwort produces fragrant, cream-colored flowers. because of its colors, the flowers are inconspicuous. White Mugwort flowers are great as cut flowers. They are very commonly used in dried arrangements. White Mugrowt makes an eye-catching background for the plants that have gray leaves and colorful flowers. These types of Artemisia flowers are not as effective when paired with white colored flowers. White Mugwort thrives in well-drained, medium moisture, and rich soil. It prefers growing in areas with full sun exposure or partial shade. They are tough plants and can tolerate drought. Ghost Plant is a variety of White Mugwort that has upright, purple colored stems that has dark green leaves, flushed with purple color. it consists of a rich spray of creamy-white colored flowers. Roman Wormwood is native to the southeastern part of Europe. It is an extremely delicate plant that can grow from 1.5 to 3 feet in height. It has ferny, triangular leaves that are gray-green in color. They grow vigorously with a spreading habit of growth. They make amazing ground covers due to their rapid growth. Some gardeners even term it as invasive. These types of Artemisia flowers are brown in color and are very small. However, they are numerous. Flowers grow at the top of the stalks in the form of thick and long spikes. The Roman Wormwood is an ingredient in vermouth and some alcoholic beverages. The leaves have an extremely fine and delicate texture that makes these types of artemisias good fillers for bouquets and dried arrangements. They are also used to make the base of miniature wreaths. Pressed leaves of Roman Wormwood are used as decorations for note cards, candles, and other crafts. 6. Silver Mound (Artemisia schmidtiana) Silver Mound is known for its delicate, fine, and attractive foliage that has a mounding habit. It is native to Japan. It is low, silky cushion having extremely fine, glistening foliage that is white in color. the flowers of Silver Mound are not attractive or prominent. The popular cultivars that are available are Silver Mound and Nana. Many people think Silver Mound and Nana are two different names of the same plant. However, Nana is just 4 inches tall whereas Silver Mound is usually a foot tall. Silver Mound is more popular, owing to its use as a low edging plant. Silver Mound is an attractive plant early in the season but the centers gape open rather sloppily due to the heat of summers. This ruins the bushy effect that is associated with the Silver Mound. 7. Beach Wormwood (Artemisia stellerana) Beach Wormwood is native to Japan, China, Russian Far East, Korea, and Aleutian Islands in the United States. It is an evergreen perennial plant that can grow 1 to 2 feet in height. Its leaves stay all year long while the flowers bloom from July to September. It has a spreading growth habit due to which it is suitable to be used as ground cover. It cannot tolerate heat or humidity in summers, although it is hardy to Zone 2. They prefer growing in medium loamy and light sandy soils that are well-drained. It can grow in acidic, basic, and neutral pH. Beach Wormwood cannot grow in shade. They can tolerate drought. Silver Brocade is a cultivar of Beach Wormwood that has felted, non-aromatic, lobed, white colored leaves and white felted stems. 8. Artemisia chamaemelifolia It is native to Asia and Central Europe. It is a semi-woody species of Artemisia. They fall under hardiness zone 3. Artemisia chamaemelifolia grows to a height of 2 feet. it has finely cut, aromatic, and smooth foliage. 9. Artemisia versicolor Artemisia versicolor is a mystery herb. Not much data is available on them, they are low growing plants that do not grow more than a foot tall. They have finely cut curly, pale gray-green foliage. 10. Sweet Wormwood (Artemisia annua) The common name of Sweet Wormwood is sweet annie. It is also known as sweet sagewort, annual wormwood, or annual mugwort. It is an annual herbaceous Artemisia that has been used for medicinal purposes for centuries. It is native to Asia. It can grow to be as tall as 9 feet. it is fast growing species of Artemisia. Sweet Wormwood contains artemisinin which is a leading treatment for malaria disease all around the world. This plant is grown only so that this compound can be derived in bulk. Artemisia annua Code : offre des tr\u00e8s ramifi\u00e9es de 30 \u00e0 100 cm, pouvant atteindre plus de 3 m en culture. ! Pour la lib\u00e9ration des plantes m\u00e9dicinales\". In terms of the climate A. annua prefers sunny and warm conditions. Its optimal growth temperature lies within 20 and 25 \u00b0C. Annual temperature sums of 3500-5000 \u00b0C (sum of temperatures higher 10 \u00b0C over one year) are required to guarantee a proper maturing. The rainfall during the growing season should not be less than 600 mm (annual rainfall higher 1150 mm). Especially the seedlings of A. annua. are susceptible to drought or water lodging. The mature plants on the other hand are quite resistant to those climate conditions. Nevertheless, the preferred soil conditions for A. annua are light soils with deep topsoils and good drainage properties.[11] But it is reported, that the plant is adaptable to different soil types. Paired with the relatively low demand on the environment Artemisia annua can have characteristics of a neophytic plant.[14] A. annua is best sown in rows to facilitate removal of weeds, which has to be done mechanically or manually because herbicides are typically not used. It is recommended to sow 1.4 - 2 seeds per square meter.[12] The fertilizer requirements are on a low level. Potassium should be used as base fertilizer. It is taken up by the plant during the whole growing season.[11] Nitrogen is required during early branching stages, an amount of approximately 70 kg N/ha is sufficient for the plant.[15] Phosphate on the other hand is required during the blooming stages. Phosphate fertilization can lead to a higher artemsinin content in the leaves.[16] The application of salicylic acid on the leaves shortly before harvesting the plant also can raise its artemisinin content.[17] Besides few viral diseases Artemisia a. has no major diseases that need to be controlled. The harvest of the plant is best done in the state of flower budding. The whole plant is harvested and cut into branches which are dried in the sun or in an oven. The drying temperature should not exceed 40 \u00b0C. The dry branches are shaken or beaten to separate the leaves from the stem. The leaves are then packed into fabric bags and shipped to further processing.[11] It is important that the temperatures during transportation and storage never get higher than 40 \u00b0C, otherwise artemisinin gets volatile and is lost into the air. The leaves should not be crushed before long time storage (1 year). The optimal storage conditions are either 20 \u00b0C with 85% relative (RH) or 30 \u00b0C with 30-40% RH.[11] Artemisia annua belongs to the plant family of Asteraceae and is an annual short-day plant. Its stem is erect brownish or violet brown. The plant itself is hairless and naturally grows from 30 to 100 cm tall, although in cultivation it is possible for plants to reach a height of 200 cm. The leaves of A. annua have a length of 3-5 cm and are divided by deep cuts into two or three small leaflets. The intensive aromatic scent of the leaves is characteristic.[10] The artemisinin content in dried leaves is in between 0% and 1.5%.[11] New hybrids of Artemisia annua developed in Switzerland can reach a leaf artemisinin content of up to 2%.[12] The small flowers have a diameter of 2-2.5 mm and are arranged in loose panicles. Their color is green-yellowish. The seeds are brown achenes with a diameter of only 0.6-0.8 mm. Their thousand-kernel weight (TKW) averages around 0.03 g (in comparison, wheat has a TKW of approximately 45 g).[10][13] Agricultural practice Artemisia annuaSeeds The growing period of Artemisia annua from seeding through to harvest is 190-240 days, depending on the climate and altitude of the production area. The plant is harvested at the beginning of flowering when the artemisinin content is the highest.[11] Dry leaf yields of Artemisia annua plantations vary between 0.5 and 3 tonnes per hectare.[12] Artemisia Vulgaris in Botanical description: It is a discrete herb which grows to height of 2 m by the roadsides and waste lands of Asia. The young stems are terete and pubescent and older stems are somewhat purplish. The leaves are simple, spiral, and exstipulate. The blade is 3-10 cm\u00d71.5-10 cm, inflorescences pendulous and terminal racemes of very small whitish capitula (look like somewhat Chenopodium album L. from far). The flowers are greenish-yellow. The achenes are brownish and ellipsoid. Medicinal use: Worms (India) Antiparasitic pharmacology Ethanol extract of leaves given to mice orally at the dose of 1 g/kg/day for 4 days reduced P. berghei parasitemia by 87.3% (Bamunuarachchi, Ratnasooriya, Premakumara, & Udagama, extract of roots was lethal for Meloidogyne megadora with the LC50 of 55.67 mg/mL, after 12 hours (Costa, Santos, & Ryan, 2003). Commentary: Essential oil secreted by this herb contains mainly thujone, 1,8-cineole, and -pinene (Judentien & Buzelyt, 2006) as well as traces of artemisinin (Mannan et al., 2010). This essential oil may, at least partially account, for the anthelminthic property, since essential oil of Artemisia annua L. displayed effects (Shakil, Prasad, Saxena, & Gupta, 2004). Artemisia annua L. has been used in China since beginning of time to treat malaria (local name: \"Qinghaosu\"), because it contains the sesquiterpene lactone artemisinin which has been developed as an antimalarial drug. Artemisinin is found in Artemisia vulgaris L. and Artemisia indica Willd. (local name: \"Pachha\") both traditionally used to treat malaria in India. Artemisia maritima L. (local name: \"Ajawaayin\") is employed as anthelmintic in India as well as Artemisia absinthium L. (local name: \"Afsanteen\") which is utilized as antimalarial in Turkey (local name: \"Acpelinotu\"). Within the tribe vulgare L. \"Peilmundi\") affords an anthelmintic remedy in India. Mugwort - aid for the feet Posted by Nadine Lemmers - 1671 0 The mugwort plant can be found in rough places and along roadsides, preferring sandy soils and is common. Mugwort grows up to 120 centimeters in length and is red in color. The leaves are hairy and the flowers are yellow-brown. mugwort Mugwort, use from prehistory to the present In prehistoric times, people probably ate mugwort as a vegetable, but it may also have been used to season food. The hairs on the underside of the leaf can be scraped off and used as tinder. All parts of the mugwort contain essential oils that can be used to control insects. Interestingly, the Mongols used the plant to repel mosquitoes by burning the leaves. The white smoke chased the mosquitoes away. The Romans used the plant in their shoes against fatigue and pain in the feet, but this remedy remains in use: Dodonaeus mentions it in the 17th century. The plant was known to the Germans and Celts to aid in childbirth. In the Middle Ages, people thought that the mugwort kept the devil at bay. In the garden, the mugwort can cause plants to grow less. The plant was smoked like tobacco instead of the expensive tobacco. Annoyingly, this plant can also cause an allergic reaction during flowering in August and September. Medicine and aid? Mugwort (FLEISCHHAUER, ET.AL., 2017, p. 195) . Thujone is a toxic substance when ingested in large quantities and when ingested for a long time. Mugwort as a tea has a relaxing effect on nervousness and sleep disorders. Mugwort should not be used in early pregnancy due to its stimulant effect. Mugwort helps with menstrual complaints, supports the pancreas and promotes digestion. Mugwort oil works for rheumatism and tired feet. Mugwort helps as a warm foot bath with warming properties for white water, chronic ovarian inflammation and abdominal or bladder catarrh (FLEISCHHAUER, ET AL, 2017, 195). In the past, mugwort root was used against epilepsy, cough, hysteria and cramps. The ground root has remained in use in herbal medicine. Dried mugwort - ready to use. Edible? Leaves and young stems can be picked in April and May and are not yet bitter and slightly aromatic. Mugwort can be added fresh in salad or as a seasoning to dishes. Mugwort is tasty as a seasoning in egg dishes (omelette) and savory pies (quiche). These parts of the mugwort can also be made into liqueurs and teas. The top 10cm of the buds before flowering can be peeled and eaten as a vegetable. The leaves and tops can be dried without stems all year round and can be used as a herb (FLEISCHHAUER, ET AL, 2017, 195). From July to October, the lignified stem with flower can be used as a seasoning. Boil the stem with flour for flavor and remove the stem before serving (FLEISCHHAUER, ET AL, 2017, 195). The seasoning can be used in dishes with meat, game and poultry, but also in sauces. Mugwort can be used in place of wormwood absinthe when making absinthe. Mugwort tastes sweet to bitter. In the second part of the year, the herb is very suitable in fatty dishes (FLEISCHHAUER, ET AL, 2017, 195). mugwort mugwort From the Hunebedcentrum you can walk the Bijvoetpad along dolmens and burial mounds. This route goes from Borger past Bronneger and Drouwen and back to Borger. The name is due to the fact that this mugwort is common along this route: the Bijvoetpad. The compositional variability of the essential oils of aerial parts of mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris L.), collected from fifteen wild populations in Lithuania is detailed. The most predominant components were davanones (13.8-45.5%, six oils), germacrene D (9.1-30.5%, four oil), camphor (18.9%, one oil), trans-thujone (8.9 and 10.9%, two oils) and cis-chrysanthenyl acetate (10.4%, one oil). To the best of our knowledge, the davanone chemotype for A. vulgaris oils is described for the first time. The toxicity of the mugwort essential oils was determined using brine shrimp (Anemia sp.) assay. LC0 values (10.3-23.1 g/mL) obtained for the oils after 24 h of exposure revealed that the oils containing appreciable amounts of germacrene D, 1,8-cineole, camphor and davanone were notably toxic. Artemisia vulgaris, the common mugwort,[2] is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family Asteraceae. It is one of several species in the genus Artemisiacommonly known as mugwort, although Artemisia vulgaris is the species most often called mugwort. It is also occasionally known as riverside wormwood,[3]felon herb, chrysanthemum weed, wild wormwood, old Uncle Henry, sailor's tobacco, naughty man, old man or St. John's plant (not to be confused with St John's wort).[4] Mugworts have been used medicinally and as culinary herbs. Traditionally, it has been used as one of the flavoring and bittering agents of gruit ales, a type of non-hopped, fermented grain beverage. In Vietnam, mugwort is used in cooking as an aromatic herb. In China, the crunchy stalks of young shoots of Artemisia vulgaris, known as luhao (Chinese: ; pinyin: l\u00faho), are a seasonal vegetable often used in stir-fries.[7] In Nepal, the plant is also called \"Titepati\" (Tite meaning bitter, pati meaning leaf) and is used as an offering to the gods, for cleansing the environment (by sweeping floors or hanging a bundle outside the home), as incense, and also as a medicinal plant.[8] The dried leaves are often smoked or drunk as a tea to promote lucid dreaming. This supposed oneirogenic effect is believed to be due to the thujone contained in the plant. Artemisia vulgaris is a tall herbaceousperennial plant growing 1-2 m (rarely 2.5 m) tall, with an extensive rhizome system. Rather than depending on seed dispersal, Artemisia vulgaris spreads through vegetative expansion and the of root rhizome fragments.[9] The leaves are 5-20 cm long, dark green, pinnate and sessile, with dense white tomentose hairs on the underside. The erect stems are grooved and often have a red-purplish tinge. The rather small florets (5 mm long) are radially symmetrical with many yellow or dark red petals. The narrow and numerous capitula (flower heads), all fertile, spread out in racemosepanicles. It flowers from mid-summer to early autumn.[10] In the past, mugwort was revered. Roman soldiers put mugwort in their sandals before marching to ward off fatigue. It was also thought to protect people from wild animals and evil spirits. People placed it under their pillows to induce vivid dreams and planted it around their houses and gardens to repel moths. In traditional Asian medicine, mugwort or wormwood is used in a process called moxibustion. Mugwort or wormwood leaves are formed into sticks or cones about the size and shape of a cigar, and then burned on or over an acupuncture point to release energy. Moxibustion has been practiced for more than 3,000 years in China, and advocates claim that it can strengthen and warm your blood and life energy, and treat inflammations and cancers. This study shows how moxa smoke can improve the autonomic nervous system and induce a relaxing effect on the body. Moxibustion is also used to treat menstrual cramping and to help a baby in the breech position turn. According to this studyTrusted Source, the practice does appear to increase fetal movements, helping the baby turn to a normal head-down, or cephalic, position. However, the authors conclude that more research needs to be done to determine moxibustion's real effectiveness. Other uses Mugwort can also be used to stimulate a women's menstrual cycle. It can bring on delayed menstruation and in the past was used to induce abortions. Pregnant and breast-feeding women are advised to avoid the herb because of this potential risk. Leaves and young seedlings can be eaten raw or cooked.[13] They can also be used in salads and soups after removal of the bitterness.[how?] Japan In Japan the herb is used to flavor ricedumplings called kusa mochi () called kusa dango ().[15][6] The young leaves can be lightly boiled before being pounded and added to which they give a pleasant colour, aroma and flavour.[15] Because of this use, the Artemesia plant is also called mochigusa (, though it is also called mogusa in reference to its use in moxibustion).[16][17] The plant is also actively grown in the state of Hawaii, and used for making the herbal mochi by residents of Japanese descent.[18] The leaves are occasionally blanched and added to soups or rice in Japanese cuisine.[19][20] Korea Mugwort, referred to as ssuk () in Korean,[7] is widely used in Korean cuisine as well as in traditional medicine (hanyak). In spring, which is the harvesting season, the young leaves of mugwort are used to prepare savory dishes ssuk). Most commonly, however, fresh mugwort as well as dried leaves ground into powder are a characteristic ingredient in various types of tteok (rice cakes).[21] Today, ssuk also adds flavor and color to more contemporary desserts and beverages, e.g. ice cream, breads, cakes, mugwort tea (ssukcha ) and ssuk latte (). In as huanghua ai (, literally yellow-flower mugwort).[23] Korea In called ssuk () or tarae ssuk ()[23] which Dangun Sinhwa (), legend of Gojoseon, the first Korean kingdom. To ancient people in Korea, ssuk was one of the food that was believed to have medicinal or religious value.[24] In the foundation myth of Gojoseon in 2333 BCE, eating nothing but 20 cloves of garlic and a bundle of ssuk for 100 days let a bear be transformed into a woman.[24 Uses Culinary Leaves and young seedlings can be eaten raw or cooked.[13] They can also be used in salads and soups after removal of the bitterness.[how?] Japan In Japan the herb is used to flavor ricedumplings called kusa mochi () called kusa dango ().[15][6] The young leaves can be lightly boiled before being pounded and added to which they give a pleasant colour, aroma and flavour.[15] Because of this use, the Artemesia plant is also called mochigusa (, though it is also called mogusa in reference to its use in moxibustion).[16][17] The plant is also actively grown in the state of Hawaii, and used for making the herbal mochi by residents of Japanese descent.[18] The leaves are occasionally blanched and added to soups or rice in Japanese cuisine.[19][20] Korea Mugwort, referred to as ssuk () in Korean,[7] is widely used in Korean cuisine as well as in traditional medicine (hanyak).

However, that does not mean they do not need to be taken care of. The foremost factor that affects the growth of Artemisia is the type of soil. They need well-drained soil for proper growth. They can grow well in rock gardens and areas with extremely sharp drainage, having long droughts. They will either dry out or rot if they are planted in moist clays or other heavy soil types. If Artemisias are grown in soil that is too moist, they grow very quickly but they flop and fall open. It is always recommended that Artemisia be planted in dry soils. Artemisia plants grow best in areas that have sun exposures and are warm. When they are planted in part shade, they are a higher risk of flopping and getting infected by the disease. In areas where there are humid summers, Artemisias can get foliar diseases that can result in a decline in the foliage (for which Artemisias are popular). it is important that the site of growth is well-ventilated and receives full sun. Some types of Artemisia grow so rapidly that they are considered invasive. They grow by underground stems or rhizomes. A check can be kept by planting Artemisias in containers or reining them in regularly by digging up runners. Artemisas are not known for their flowers but for their aroma and for their foliage. Artemisias are one of those genera of plants that have stunning foliage. Types of Artemisia flowers aren't many, as most of the types of Artemisias have inconspicuous, white or yellow flowers. In 1971, scientists demonstrated the plant extracts had antimalarial activity in primate models, and in 1972, the active ingredient, artemisinin (formerly referred to as arteannuin), was isolated and its chemical structure described.[8][18] Artemisinin may be extracted using a low boiling point solvent, such as diethylether, and is found in the glandular trichomes of the leaves, stems, and inflorescences, and is concentrated in the upper portions of plant within new growth.[8][19] Research to develop antimalarial drugs led to the discovery of artemisinin in the 1970s by Chinese scientist, Tu Youyou, who shared the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.[9][18][23] An improved extract was obtained by using a low-temperature, ether-based extraction method, further showing the artemisinin derivative, artemether, to be an effective antimalarial drug.[8][18] Artemisinin is a sesquiterpenelactone with an endoperoxide bridge and has been produced as an antimalarial drug.[8] The efficacy of tea, made with either water or urine and A. annua, for the treatment of malaria is dubious, and is discouraged by the World Health Organization.[11][24] Research has found that artemisinin is not soluble in water and the concentrations in these infusions are considered insufficient to treat malaria.[25][26][27] A 2012 review stated that artemisinin-based remedies are the most effective drugs for the treatment of malaria.[28] A 2013 review suggested that although Artemisia annua may not cause hepatotoxicity, haematotoxicity, or hyperlipidemia, it should be used cautiously during pregnancy due to a potential risk of embryotoxicity at a high dose.[29] The World Health Organization has approved riamet (Coartem), a combination of lumefantrine (120 mg) and artemether (an artemisinin derivative extracted with ether, 20 mg) in repeat treatments over two days, producing efficacy of up to 98% against malaria.[8] Despite global efforts in combating malaria, it remains a large burden for the population, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.[8][33] As of 2013, it seems that the pathogenic agent of malaria is becoming resistant to artemisinin-based drugs.[34][35] Emergence of artemisinin resistance has been identified in Cambodia and the border of Thailand.[36] Although WHO recommends artemisinin-based remedies for treating uncomplicated malaria, artemisinin resistance has become a concern.[33] The causes that affected the emergence of artemisinin resistance include the use of artemisinin-based remedies.[33] Encouraging herbal alternatives are in the pipeline, but a more dependable solution for the eradication of malaria would be the creation of an effective vaccination.[33] (Yeah right, see note*) Resistance will likely spread to other endemic areas across the world.[36] Note: Vaccination is not preferable to herbs! Vaccinations go straight into the bloodstream, and for that reason alone they are bad. Big Pharma hates natural remedies and will go to great lengths to discredit them and push their toxic junk. Don't fall for it. Herbal remedies are always preferable to pharmaceutics, for the reason alone that herbs have thousands of compounds that are effective. Pharmaceuticals have just 1, and therefor are toxic, have nasty side effects, and its easy for pathogens to build resistance to them. so after all that.they are ineffective as well. Phytomedicine by a research team at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) led by biology and biotechnology professor Pamela Weathers demonstrates that treatment with the dried leaves of the plant Artemisia annua (DLA) can cure even drug-resistant malaria. The report adds to earlier research by the Weathers team showing that DLA was more effective than conventional malaria drugs in knocking out the malaria parasite (PLOS ONE, 2012) and that DLA is not prone to drug resistance (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2015). With malaria still raging as one of the most prevalent and deadly infectious diseases of the developing world, the research offers hope for an effective and low-cost treatment.

Google Scholar I have the answer to cancer, but American doctors won't listen. They come here and observe my methods and are impressed. Then they want to make a special deal so they can take it home and make a lot of money. I won't do it, so I'm blackballed in every country.- Dr Johanna Budwig.1 Basically, it's a combination of flaxseed oil, cottage cheese, organic foods, herbal and homeopathic formulas, exercise, fresh air and sunbathing in a controlled and healthy way. Her simple techniques provided patients with renewed energy and visible improvements, sometimes, within days. 5 Johanna Budwig, was a pharmacist and biochemist.with a PhD in natural sciences who had studied the blood of cancer patients for over 30 years. She also found that there was a greenish, yellowish slime in the blood of cancer patients. Dr. Budwig also discovered that in general, blood that comes from a healthy person contains far greater levels of Omega-3-ALA essential fatty acids than blood samples taken from someone who is ill.7 After this discovery, she immediately started developing a diet and nutritional guidelines to cure cancer. And this resulted in an oil/protein paste which is still known as the 'budwig porridge'. Because of her success in healing cancer in patients who were given up by conventional doctors, Dr Johanna Budwig had been a nominee for the Nobel Prize seven times.8 In an interview in 2000. with the one she nominated the head of the Budwig Institute, Dr. Lloyd Jenkins, she said: \"From 1939 on, I was in charge of the dispensary in a military hospital with 5000 beds. In 1949, I returned to Dr. Kaufmann's facility in Munster at his request and I was immediately assigned the post of State Expert for Chemical Research on Drugs and Fats. As part of an evaluation of drugs based on sulfhydryl groups, I was confronted with the fact that no blood-chemical measure existed to test fat metabolism.\"9 The development of paper chromatography In the late 1940s, Dr. Johanna Budwig succeeded in developing a process by which fats could be broken down and analyzed based on their smallest components. A great achievement for both Dr. Johanna Budwig as well as for the entire scientific community. \"It was through the development of paper chromatography in the field of lipid research- in other words, through novel examination of fatty substances on paper- which I (Dr. Budwig) initially carried out in 1949 without any idea of how great an impact it would have on the entire field of medicine, which allowed a thousandth of a milligram of fat to be analyzed on paper. One thousandth of a milligram of fat, taken from approximately one drop of blood, could now be separated into its various constituents and could accurately characterized according to its various fatty acid components. \" - Dr. Johanna Budwig With this new analysis method came innovative, reliable understanding regarding fatty acids. She was now also able to differentiate between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. As a result, Dr. Johanna Budwig was able to identify flaxseed as a significant source of highly unsaturated fatty acids. In the following years, she devoted herself passionately researching its properties. She says: So I decided straight away to go for human trials and enrolled 600 patients from four big hospitals in Munster (Germany). I started to give flax oil and cottage cheese to the cancer patients. After just three months, patients began to improve in health and strength, the yellow- green substance in their blood began to disappear, tumors gradually receded...I treated approximately 2500 cancer patients in the last few decades.10 This was Dr. Johanna Budwig's first scientific breakthrough. 11 It was a logical folloe up of Revici's findings of Omega-3-ALAand Omega 6LA's cancer fighting properties, as well as the Burrs's discovery of Omega-3-ALAand Omega 6LA as essential nutrients. As a scientist, she will have been familiar with their work. Otto Warburg discovered that many known chronic illnesses including cancer occur because of A lack of oxygen in the body So these findings were not unique to Dr. Budwig. What was unique to her was her dietary approach to healing cancer. She linked cancer to the consumption of refined or partially hydrogenated oils and sugars and to as eficiency in essential fatty acids12 These trans fats are found in commonly used cooking oils. Most companies extract oil from corn, sunflower seeds, and other plants through extreme heat, and other artificial processes, none of which are the natural extraction procedure. As a result, these oils are no longer alive and are no longer advisable for consumption. Additionally, when the heavy oils incorporate into our cell membranes, they destroy the electric charge. Without that charge, our cells start to suffocate due to a lack of oxygen. Trans fats are also a trigger factor for Type II Diabetes since insulin is a large molecule, and trans fats challenge the molecule's entry through the cell membrane. Dr. Budwig examined the blood of her patients under a microscope before and after administering her mix of flaxseed oil and quark. She found that the blood no longer clumped together, and a substance displaying a greenish color was no longer present. Instead, the red was much brighter, which is a very positive indicator and a sign of improvement and increased oxygen intake. After extensive research, in 1950 she was able to present these groundbreaking results together with Dr. Kaufmann- which had been published in the same year under the title 'New methods of lipid analysis' in the journal 'Fats and Soaps'- at the Munich Lipid Researchers Conference. In fact, our current understanding of the components and the effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids is in large part based on her findings Proof of Trans fats Evidence of the harmfulness of trans fats In 1951, Dr. Johanna Budwig was appointed as the expert consultant with regard to pharmaceutical products and fatty acids at the Federal Institute for Lipid Research. Simultaneously, she began researching commercial fats, and had thus- without even knowing it- engaged a powerful opponent. Post-war Germany was experiencing an economic revival. Gone were the times of rations and butter substitutes- people were finally able to indulge themselves again. Rich and plentiful food was what the people sought after. The German food industry reported record profits. It was not an ideal time to be a fatty acid researcher whose studies in 1952 confirmed the harmfulness of trans fats. These findings were met by an outcry from the young, but powerful margarine industry, whose claims she refuted with meticulously kept statistical records. For her- a scientist first and foremost- publishing results was obviously top priority. Dr. Johanna Budwig reflected upon these circumstances in her renowned, scientific books. From this point on she found herself unable to ignore the obvious relationship between diet and disease progression. She continued to immerse herself in the relevant subject matter. Using animal models in 1957, she was able to demonstrate the different effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the body. In the case of a heart attack, we are presented with an anatomical picture which shows us that the only thing out of the ordinary is dietary fat- fat which has hardened around the otherwise lean heart muscle, encasing it and interfering with its normal activity. In patients affected by rheumatism, the only characteristic that distinguishes muscle from afflicted patients from that of healthy patients are fats which have been excreted- a clear rejection of this type of fat by the living organism. In 1957 at the international conference for nutrition, where 900 specialists from all over the world presented their latest scientific findings at the Institute for Cancer Research in Paris, the sole detectable substance or phenomenon reported which set cancer cells apart from their healthy counterparts was that fats which had been excreted were visible in the cell bodies and their nuclei, as well as in the cytoplasm. [...] [...] I had the opportunity in the context of the above mentioned location to pose the question: 'why search for what is behind the phenomenon? Why not examine the phenomenon itself instead?' Fats which have been expelled- a clear rejection of these substances.15 By 1969, she alone registered eight processes for the manufacture of non-hazardous food products with a long shelf-life. The History of Lipid Research A look back at the history of lipid research One of the central issues driving Dr. Johanna Budwig was her interest in the regulation of cellular oxygen uptake, along with any factors which might interfere with the process. Researchers such as Otto Warburg had already recognized that the sulfhydryl-containing amino acid cysteine- an important protein building block- played a critical role in cellular respiration. Otto Warburg suspected that fatty acids were another important factor for the oxygen uptake of the cell. He conducted his experiments using saturated fatty acids such as butyric acid, stearic acid, or palmitic acid. Yet this did not lead to the results he had hoped for. It was not until the 1950s, when Dr. Johanna Budwig developed her technique of paper chromatography, that answers to these predominant questions could be found through the identification and quantification of lipids and fatty acids. Subsequent research confirmed Dr. Johanna Budwig's hypothesis. She proved that the essential polyunsaturated fatty acids Linoleic-Acid and -linolenic acid are of vital importance as interaction partners to the sulfur amino acids for oxygen uptake in the cell. The significant feature of these polyunsaturated fatty acids is their enormous electron potential. The energy contained in the double bonds of fatty acids is freely available for electro-physical processes in the cell. The negative charge of these fatty acids makes them an optimal binding partner for the positively charged sulfur-containing amino acids. Together they form the battery of our cells and control their energy potential. In the meantime, the physicist and lipid researcher Dr. Johanna Budwig's approach has been confirmed. Where Nobel Laureate, Otto Heinrich Warburg, was unable to report results, Dr. Budwig continued her investigations into cell respiration. Dr. Warburg, a physician and biochemist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1931, had already discovered in the 1920s that cancer cells possess a unique metabolism. While healthy cells convert sugar from food into carbon dioxide and water while consuming oxygen during so-called cellular respiration, tumor cells obtain their energy by fermenting the sugar to lactic acid. This process also takes place when sufficient oxygen is available. In 2006, a collaborative research team under the direction of Prof. Dr. Michael Ristow (L\u00fcbeck, April 24, 1967) 16from the Universities of Jena and Potsdam was able to confirm the over 80 year old hypothesis of the Nobel Prize winner, Otto Warburg. Using the example of colon cancer in animal models, the team of scientists demonstrated the process of oxidation in tumor cells. The suppressed cellular respiration in these cancer cells could be stimulated again through treatment with a certain protein. The result showed that the cells of the animals tested had lost the ability to form malignant tumors. This served as proof that the rate of tumor growth depends on certain metabolic processes and that these can be manipulated successfully. US biologists, specifically a research team led by Thomas Seyfried and Michael Kiebish17 from Boston College, re-investigated the Warburg hypothesis in 2008.18 They concentrated intensely on the structure and function of the mitochondrial membrane in mice with different brain tumors. Mitochondria are cellular organelles called- in other words constituents of the cell- and the actual site of cellular respiration. In their observations, particular attention was given to a substance called cardiolipin- a phospholipid which stabilizes the mitochondrial membrane. There were significant differences in the membrane structure between healthy and diseased mice. The cardiolipins of the diseased mice were composed differently, resulting in a disruption of one of the most vital aspects of metabolism- namely electron transport- and thus to interfering with the entire energy production process. These results support the Warburg hypothesisas well as the methods of Revici. A special combination: quark with flax seed oil A dietary imbalance between omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids can lead to an increase of inflammatory substances in the body to which the development of many diseases affecting civilization have been attributed. The relationship between good health and the consumption of essential fatty acids was already clear to Dr. Johanna Budwig as early as the 1950s. \"The absence of these highly unsaturated fatty acids causes many vital functions to weaken,\" was a statement often made by her. In Dr. Johanna Budwig's opinion, the wrong kinds of fatty acids were the greatest evil in increasingly industrialized food. Following the discovery of trans fats- fats stripped of their electric charges- in margarine and in other high-heat fats, the presence of these fatty acids was detected integrated in human cells.19 Dr. Johanna Budwig saw a clear relationship between impaired oxygen uptake and the synthesis and/or structure of cell membranes. These membranes lacked polyunsaturated fatty acids- the regulating, energy-rich, and, thus, life-giving and driving force behind normal cellular function. But omega-3 fatty acids are not only necessary for oxygenation of the cell. Harmonic metabolic processes, a strong immune system, and mental balance are also facilitated via communication between the cell membrane and the cell interior. The fluidity (fluidity / flexibility) of the cell membrane affects its properties and, therefore, functions. It is the location of information exchange and substance transportation. Omega-3 fatty acids contribute to the proper fluidity of the membrane and, thus, have a decisive influence on its function. The development of the oil-protein diet Dr. Johanna Budwig's extensive knowledge of oils and fats along with the results from her research led her to develop the oil-protein diet. In this nutrition concept, natural and energy-dense foods play the leading role. Essential fatty acids, in particular omega-3 fatty acid and Alpha-Linolenic-Acid, and sulfur containing amino acids, such as methionine and cysteine, are paramount. In flax seed oil, a vegetable oil which contains nearly 60 % omega-3 fatty acids, and quark with a high content of sulfur containing amino acids, Dr. Johanna Budwig found the perfect pairing to form the foundation of her diet. Remember Emanuel Revici said the very same thing. But quark is not the only Sulfur containg food.. All proteins, like dairy products, legumes and nuts have sulfur. Milk kefir works as well. And she was not the first to discover the cancer fighting properties o sulfur. Dr Revici called the combination of Linoleic-Acid and sulur the secret of his success in curing cancer. Budwig said, that the consumption of amino acids which include a sulfur group promotes healthy digestion of as well as tolerance of fatty acids. The bond generated between these two components allows them to form lipoproteins (lipos = fat / protein = protein), which increases their shared solubility. It is in this form that sulfurous amino acids are able to aid in the transport of long chain fatty acids. Co-administration of fatty acids and amino acids in a homogeneous mixture as in quark with flax seed oil ensures a timely incorporation of valuable nutrients into the body. Dr. Johanna Budwig's longstanding research, experience, and knowledge led her to develop a holistic health concept which considered first and foremost the individual patient and their lifestyle. As a healer, Johanna Budwig observed a variety of diseases whose causes she believed to be rooted in unhealthy fats. When consulting with a patient, Dr. Johanna Budwig first looked critically at their diet before prescribing a personalized nutrition plan based on the oil-protein diet developed by her. For her, proper diet was one of the most critical factors for maintaining health. However, a lack of social acceptance, disharmonious relationships, or unhappy family or career situations can have substantially long term effects on quality of life or make a person ill. Dr. Johanna Budwig stated this in no uncertain terms. \"It is very important that a person is seen as a unity of body, soul, and spirit. Which contributing factor requires priority at the moment, can be very different. I am still convinced that if a woman is in a very unhealthy marriage, in which she must endure daily oppression and taunting from her husband, then I cannot help her even with quark flax seed oil. Human beings require all three factors together.\" Dr. Johanna Budwig As a physicist, Dr. Johanna Budwig also always kept in mind the electromagnetic fields surrounding people. She rejected synthetic clothes and foam mattresses on the basis that these acted as energy thieves. Instead she advocated mattresses made of natural materials, such as coconut fiber, horsehair, wool, and cotton. In addition to materials that promote a healthy, restful sleep, Dr. Johanna Budwig attached great importance to the notion of bedtime and a correspondingly long sleep duration to promote relaxation and regeneration. Dr. Johanna Budwig endorsed the beneficial effects of exercise and recreation, as well. In this case too, she always customized her advice to the individual patient before her. People are still healing from cancer using her protocol.20 Listen to what doctors say about her protocol: \"We are general practitioners specializing (among other areas) in Holistic Cancer Treatment. For our holistic approach, we use Tumor Therapy....The one element which clearly stands out as having the greatest importance and forming the basis of all holistic tumor therapy is the oil-protein diet according to Dr. Johanna Budwig. If this nutritional regimen is implemented without deviation, there is a chance of recovery at every stage of tumor development (which we have personally witnessed in our practice!). We now try to make all our tumor patients arrange their regimen in accordance with Dr. Johanna Budwig's suggestions. It is crucial to stick to her dietary schedule exactly as stated.\" 21 And not only cancer is healed. Diabetes, Alzheimer, rheumatoid arthritis asthma, the list of ailments that are helped by the Budwig protocolgoes on On August 24th, 2000, Dr. Johanna Budwig authorized Lloyd Jenkins Ph.D., the founder of the Budwig Center, to use her techniques and protocols. Ever since, they have helped a vast number of people to improve their health. The Budwig Center s primary approach is to establish the reason/cause of the disease and the specific trigger factors involved. They determine whether it is a degenerative or chronic disease or even a tumor. Armed with this insight, they alleviate the adverse effects of the disease and aid remission through natural therapies and treatments. With this approach, They also reduce the harmful effects of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and other treatments of general medical practice, if you should choose to undergo such treatments. Basically, it's a combination of flaxseed oil, cottage cheese, organic foods, herbal and homeopathic formulas, exercise, fresh air and sunbathing in a controlled and healthy way. Her simple techniques provided patients with renewed energy and visible improvements, sometimes, within days. 22 The Budwig Porridge She developed a porridge, the Budwig porridge,which oil (Omega-3-ALA) with (probiotics and protein) 23, that succesfully cleared the blood of the greenish-yellowish slime, heightened the Omega-3 levels and cleared patients of cancer, even those that were given up and sent home to die by hospitals. The Budwig porridge is gaining popularity because it is known as a nutritional aid that can help prevent and cure cancer. Well, that's quite a bit. That's why it's time to see what that budwig paste actually contains and what is said about it. So, how do you actually make that budwig porridge? What is a budwig porridge? It is edible and actually not that bad, because the addition of a little honey and fruit makes it a bit sweeter. It's easy to make and the ingredients can even be bought as 'ready-made' in the health food store, so that makes it a lot easier. It is very similar to a normal yogurt or cottage cheese breakfast with muesli, but slightly different. You can keep it simple or throw in anything. It's just what you like. The original composition: 3 tbsp milk 3 tbsp linseed oil 100 gr low-fat cottage cheese 1 tsp honey Fresh fruits nuts oat flakes Possibly a few flavoring additions such as coconut or cinnamon, etc. The main ingredients in this 'porridge' are the cottage cheese and the linseed oil. This is because the linseed oil contains the ideal composition of unsaturated fatty acids and the cottage cheese contains the necessary sulfur-containing amino acids. It is easy to put together and prepare yourself, so this should be doable for everyone. What is the purpose of the budwig porridge? As mentioned, the budwig porridge is suitable in a diet that could prevent or help reduce cancer. I don't want to use the word 'cure' here because that sounds very optimistic. But, it is claimed, certainly on the site of Johanna Budwig, who passed away in 2003. What is certain is that it is healthy and also the ideal breakfast. But even after some research on the internet it turned out that the budwig porridge is very often recommended when it comes to nutrition in cancer patients. Also for women who are in the menopause, this breakfast seems to help against hot flashes. What also makes this breakfast so healthy is that it contains good elements such as sulfur-containing proteins (cottage cheese), polyunsaturated fats (linseed oil) and ballast materials. And this together has a good influence on the intestinal flora Flaxseed oil is very good anyway because it can be converted in the body into important substances, including prostaglandins, which are suspected of having cancer-inhibiting properties. This substance also has an anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-allergic effect, and the Omega-3 fatty acids from linseed oil have a regenerating effect on cell membranes and the immune system Finally: The Budwig porridge is 'a good start to the day'. And if you are one of those people who always eat yogurt or cottage cheese in the morning, it is a small transition to good nutrition. Are you someone who eats corn flakes, or those countless other packages you see in a row in the supermarket, that promise you everything but don't deliver and that are full of bad sugars, aspartame or bad fats? Then switch to the 'budwig porridge'. Because this really makes a difference. If you want to know more about Johanna Budwig and her program, check out her website24 Processed foods, added sugars (apart from honey), refined grains, and hydrogenated fats are all off-limits on the Budwig Diet. Although many types of meat, fish, poultry, and free-range eggs are permitted in small amounts, pork, shellfish, and processed meats are banned 25 FOODS TO ENJOY ON THE BUDWIG PROTOCOL SAUERKRAUT JUICE AND FERMENTED FOODS: Dr. Budwig favored fermented foods. Dr. Budwig had all her patients drink a glass of fresh sauerkraut juice first thing in the morning. She recommended adding a little pineapple juice if people thought that improved the taste. She knew that cabbage offers a host of health benefits. The famous Captain James Cook sailed around the world without losing a single sailor to scurvy, thanks to the foods his ship carried, including sixty barrels of sauerkraut. Natural (no sugar) pickles are also acceptable. BUDWIG MUESLI: To be eaten a minimum of once a day and when possible, twice a day. Usually, Dr. Johanna Budwig would serve it to her patients twice a day. The quark or cottage cheese used in this recipe should be made from skimmed milk. It is essential to use the low-fat cottage cheese or quark (no more than 2% fat content). The omega-3 rich flaxseed oil, which she was greatly in favor of, only produced the chemical reaction that enabled the flaxseed oil to become water soluble and enter the cells when mixed with quark or cottage cheese with low-fat content. The negative aspects of dairy seem to be largely neutralized when combined with flaxseed, SWEETENERS: Stevia ( 100% pure, no harmful additives), raw honey and natural dried fruit like dates and figs and raisins. ORGANIC FRUITS AND VEGETABLES: Whenever possible, Johanna Budwig recommended consuming seasonal fruits and vegetables, preferably raw or steamed, thus retaining all the nutrients. For a larger intake, she suggested making vegetable juices or fruit and vegetable shakes. She did not recommend fruit juices where the pulp has been separated from the fruit. She advised to use a type of blender that retained the pulp and is capable of juicing vegetables like carrots. She said people should always try their very best to consume only organic, not GMO (Genetically modified). NUTS, DRIED FRUITS, AND SEEDS: Only natural (no hydrogenated oils) and not roasted. Several published studies have identified walnuts as bearing unique cancer-fighting qualities. Researchers at UC Davis and other institutions have uncovered that diets rich in whole walnuts, as well as walnut oil, have the ability to slow prostate cancer growth in mice. Other studies determined that just two handfuls of walnuts each day could reduce by half the risk of breast cancer and tumor growth. It is believed that walnuts can shrink levels of the hormone IGF-1, known to play a key role in development of both prostate and breast cancer. Also, Researchers found they reduced cholesterol and increased insulin sensitivity, making them valuable in the fight against heart disease and diabetes. Look for a wholesale importer of nuts as they often have the pure raw nuts with no added harmful oils and refined salt and it works out more economical than the grocery store. FLAXSEEDS and FLAXSEED OIL in your daily salad: It is recommended to grind up - in a coffee grinder - 1 tablespoon of flaxseeds and sprinkle them over your salad. Also, mix 50/50 flaxseed oil and olive oil to put over your salads daily. You will find this really adds great flavor and health benefits to your meal. HERBS and HERBAL TEAS: Dr. Budwig used herbs generously in her program. Such as Chai tea, Jasmine tea, Basil, cinnamon bark, clove, fennel seed, dandelion, fenugreek seed, ginger, spearmint, star anise, turmeric, and thyme. Many herbal teas are useful for pain and meridian balancing. Maria Treben was motivated to become a herralist when she saw people who were given up by the dotors heal from cancer just by drinking tea. that's what the e4dc herb rotation schedule is based on. COLD PRESSED OR EXTRA VIRGIN OILS: . Each type of oil has a distinct taste and contains vital characteristics to oxygenate the cells. They are to be ingested raw, as a dressing or in a shake. The only oil that should be used for cooking is coconut oil. (Tests have shown the extra virgin olive oil and red palm oil are fine for cooking as well). ORGANIC WHOLE GRAINS: Dr. Johanna Budwig's favorite grain was buckwheat. Try variations like quinoa, whole grain Basmati rice, millet, and spelt. The Western diet uses large amounts of wheat in their dishes and recipes, and growing numbers of people are intolerant to it. Try sprouted grains or Ezekiel bread. Corn is not recommended because (unless otherwise stated) it usually is genetically modified (GMO) and could easily have traces of mold. It also produces inflammation. ORGANIC PULSES: Chickpeas, beans, and lentils are all very nutritional, and especially rich in monoacids. Start with 2 tablespoons of low-fat milk, the 3 tablespoons of linseed (flaxseed) oil, which you will mix together with a Wisk type mixer or electric stick type blender until nice and smooth, (an electric blender is preferred as you can be surer the oil blends well with all the other ingredients). Next, add 1 teaspoon of honey and mix all 3 ingredients well. Now slowly add the low-fat quark or cottage cheese 2 tablespoons at a time and keep mixing until it is combined well, putting in a total of 6 level tablespoons of Low-Fat Quark/cottage cheese. In a separate bowl put 2 tablespoons of freshly crushed flaxseeds that you have ground up with a coffee grinder. Now put some fruit (berries, lemon juice, etc.) or nuts over the seeds. Then finally, pour the mixture of Quark, honey, and oil over the freshly ground flaxseed and fruit. That is the original way Dr. Budwig liked to prepare the mix for her patients. NOTE: Ground seed starts to turn rancid after 20 minutes, so it must be ingested immediately. Do not grind and store seeds to be used later. The flaxseed oil must be kept cold, so store it in the fridge. Try to purchase directly from the manufacturer, or from an herbalist/health food shop. The cottage cheese/quark can be frozen if necessary. FOODS TO AVOID ON THE BUDWIG PROTOCOL Refined Sugar: Cancer cells require 18 times more sugar than normal healthy cells because their mitochondria are damaged. Therefore, consuming refined sugar feeds the cancer cells. Although we may directly avoid sugar, please keep in mind that the following foods have sugar content: Ice-cream (commercial ice creams also often contain chemicals like carboxymethyl cellulose, butyraldehyde, amyl acetate and diethyl glycol which are also used in anti-freeze and paint removers), pastries, fizzy drinks, boxed cereals, ready-made sauces and even in savory food, for example, bread. Read labels carefully. Avoid fructose syrups, maple syrup, sugarcane honey (molasses) and artificial sweeteners. Fizzy (soft) drinks can have up to 10 teaspoons of refined white sugar. Fruit juices from concentrate have high sugar content and low nutritional value since the UHT manufacturing process leads to the loss of most of its beneficial vitamins. REFINED OR HYDROGENATED OILS Regardless of the plant or seed, oils that have been refined cause our cells to suffocate. We should, therefore, avoid fried food (chicken, fries, chips, doughnuts, etc.) and try to cook our hot meals at home using coconut oil, which can tolerate high temperatures without altering the oil's components. DAIRY PRODUCTS Except cottage cheese or quark used in the Budwig Muesli, we do not use dairy products (including butter) in our diet because they contain animal fats that retain toxins and contribute towards Candida and fungus growth. | BUTTER Should be avoided, make your own Oleolux instead (recipe provided at the end of this guide). SHELLFISH Lobster, clams, shrimp, prawns, (although they are not shellfish: squid and octopus are also not recommended). Shellfish (i.e., seafood) eat everything in their environment; so by consuming them, you may also be ingesting heavy metals and other toxins. PORK AND COLD MEATS Dr. Budwig encouraged a vegetarian food plan where no meat was permitted. Please be reminded that animal toxins are stored in their fat, which is why it is best to avoid pork and cold meats. Also, many types of cold meats contain chemical additives such as nitrates. Dr. Johanna Budwig said that red meat contributes to swelling or inflammation and she was not in favor of eating pork due to the nature of the pig's digestive system. Pigs eat everything in sight and digest their food in approximately 4 hours, leaving a large number of toxins, which end up in the fatty tissue of the animal. Ongoing consumption of pork products has been linked to inflammation of the joints (arthritis). REFINED GRAINS & CEREALS White bread, pasta, and all refined cereals are hard to digest. They do not contain the nutrients and fiber needed by the intestine, and worse still, they help increase glucose levels, which also promote Candida and fungus issues. | COFFEES, TEAS, AND PREPARED BEVERAGES all herbal teas should be herbal loose-leaf infusions, since tea bags and paper filters contain harmful chemicals, such as chlorine. Coffee is somewhat controversial but if you must drinkit, be sure to drink no more than one cup and drink organic coffee, because regular coffee is heavily treated with chemicals such as pesticides, etc., during cultivation. MICROWAVES Microwaves destroy most nutrients and the beneficial elements that food can provide for us, as well as distorting the molecular structure of food. TEFLON (Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE): Food cooked on Teflon type frying pans contains small particles of PTFE, which, when consumed, are harmful to the reproductive system. ALUMINUM KITCHEN UTENSILS These put us at risk of heavy metal poisons seeping into the meals we prepare. Budwig recommends using kitchen utensils made of stainless steel, wrought-iron, glass or earthenware 26 Johanna Budwig's protocol continues to be applied to this day, with many testifying to its success in healing cancer. We are fully entitled to consider my approach as a highly beneficial treatment. When correctly applied it can in many cases even bring advanced malignancies under control. -Dr. Emanuel Revici Health is based on two dynamic forces in all living organisms\"Catabolism (breaking down, acidic) and Anabolism (building up, alkeline). -Dr. Emanuel Revici Did the Burrs influence Dr Emanuel Revici (Bucharest, September 6, 1896- New York, January 9, 1998), or did he influence them? They were first to publish, but he had researched Linoleic-Acid before they did. Emanuel Revici's method for treating cancer Dr. Emanuel Revici pioneered nontoxic lipid treatments for cancer in the mid-1920s . He has treated cancer for70 years and cured thousands and thousands and thousands of patients of cancer 1 . He was the first research clinician to treat cancer with Omega-3-ALA 2. Combining Newtonian physics and quantum mechanics, he redefined lipids, accurately describing their molecular activity, organization, and properties 3 .He used Omega-3-ALA combined with sulfur to cure cancer 4. Sulfur5occurs in foods as part of protein: milk, legumes, nuts. Dr Revici said that this combination killed tumors in rats and in people. The tumor is dead after a month, but takes a 3 or 4 months to disappear. Once it is dead, it does not cause any pain anymore. In this lecture6 from 1986, Dr Revici says that free fatty acids only occur in the lesions. A lesion is any damage or abnormal change in the tissue of an organism, usually caused by disease or trauma. Lesion is derived from the Latin laesio \"injury\". 7The ingested or injected fatty acids with sulfur survive the stomache, are transported through the blood and bind to the free fatty acids in the tumor and kill the cancer. He calls that the secret of his therapy.8 It is an atomic absorption. His discovery has 3 parts. 1. the lipid: 2. he combines the lipid with the substance that he wants to transport to the tumor, like berylium, sulfur, or selenium. (all catabolic, acidic) 3. The lipid brings the substance to the cancer, because it brings it to the free lipid. So you have a targeted approach this way. Sulfur works best. Sulfur in the lipid works. Just the sulfur does not work, for example sulfur in a water solution does not work. The lipid is taken by the lipids in the red blood cells and goes where there is a free lipid, and goes there in 15 minutes whether you inject it or ingest it.Within 15 minutes the pain stops, It is even a way for detecting tumors9. Lipids are mostly in the membrane of the cell. They are in the membrane of the chromosome. Where there is a membrane, there is a lipid. We are a lipidic world, totally dependant on lipids. The lipid we ingest finds the lesion, because that's the only place where there are free lipids. So the ingested lipid binds to free lipids, thus targetting the cancer. There is no relation between arthritis and cancer. Dr Revici says that elements and vitamins are anabolic (constructive, alkaline) or catabolic (destructive, acidic) in nature. The schedule below shows which he categorized as anabolic and which as catabolic Revici's Periodic Chart of Anabolic and Catabolic Elements Revici also emphasized the psychological aspect, that they had hope again and that helped with the healing as well. Heisihting for lie biologically and spiritually He said chemotherapy and radiation do not work. His treatment with Omega-3-ALAand sulfur works against AIDS as well He saw cancer as a parasite,The tumor is painful when it reaches the connective tissue Sulfur lipids work against cancer. 15 Dr Revici advises to take the sulfur-lipid combination once a week as a preventative measure against cancer. The following is an excerpt rfrom one of Revici's admirers: Experiments with dilute phosphoric acid yielded approximately converse results. Knowing that such small amounts of dilute base or acid would not change bodily pH, he then placed platinum electrodes into painful loci of patients with superficial tumors, as well as into non-painful regions of the tumor mass and into normal tissue. These experiments led to a remarkable conclusion: The pH of painful local lesions was not only different from the rest of the body, but could be rapidly and specifically altered by the ingestion of small amounts of acid or base. As a result of these initial studies, Revici proposed that a critical distinction be made between pathological pain and what he termed \"physiological pain,\" a distinction supported by many subsequent years of research.16 Wishing to relieve pain in his cancer patients, he decided to develop lipidic means of altering pH, realizing that interventions based on ions, amino acids, or proteins would prove too shortlived to provide meaningful benefit. Before he could carry out this work, however, he determined that it was necessary to define lipids as more than greasy, water-insoluble substances extractable in ether (a definition still found in many present-day biochemistry books). Decades earlier than anyone else in the field, he redefined these important substances at a molecular level, describing accurately the relative importance of the polar and non-polar regions of these molecules. This definition guided his utilization of lipids for therapeutic purposes by providing a precise structural guide to the analysis of compounds he would go on to create.17 While seeking to develop better means of analyzing the effects of lipids on the organism, and being intrigued by his observations that the mineral constituents of the nuclei and cytoplasm resembled the earth's crust rather than sea water, Revici also initiated a systematic study of the effects of different elements on bodily function. 18 This research led him to categorize elements as to whether they primarily were inductive of anabolic (building up) or catabolic (breaking down) metabolism, terms which, to some extent, became interchangeable in his thought with categorization according to whether an element contributed to an alkaline (building up) or acidic (breaking down) state. Remarkably, he found that within a vertical series of the Periodic Table of the Elements, elements acted similarly; and he deduced that their valency shell in part determined their bioactivity. Based upon his analysis of elements in different levels of organismal organization (cell, tissue organ, system), and the effects of specific elements on cellular pathology, he suggested that the concentration of an element in different organizational levels was both precisely regulated and a critical determinant of normal and pathological states.19 A further component of Revici's development stemmed from his observations on the molecular structure of carcinogens and other bioactive molecules. In contrast to the prevailing wisdom (expressed most forcefully by Linus Pauling), he observed that many bioactive molecules exhibited a charge structure in which adjacent carbon atoms would be predicted to carry identical charges. As with so. much of his work, examination of molecular structures makes one wonder why his peers resisted this discovery: Perusal of the Merck Index reveals example after example of bioactive molecules with such an energetic configuration.20 The concepts Revici evolved from study of these \"twin formations\" (as he termed them), or energetic centers, also played a crucial role in his design of medicaments.21 Time after time, his investigation of lipid function and chemistry opened the way to findings that predate ideas now widely accepted. For instance: 20 or more years before Bengt Samuelsson22 described leukotrienes, receiving a Nobel Prize for his work23 Revici described them in essence, recognizing their crucial role in inflammation.24 Typically for him, though, he also saw these compounds as a small part of a much larger picture. Instead of choosing the traditional scientific path of focusing the next 10 years of his research on this one topic, he went on to describe presciently the capital role of bioactive lipids in the early stages of cellular and systemic host defense processes, deducing that intervention by lipids at this level of the body's defenses might drastically alter outcome, and even the extent of mobilization, occurring at other levels25. At this stage in his development, Revici incorporated another important foundation principle: That frequently the damage done to any organism by disease is caused not by the pathogenic focus but by the body's defense mechanisms as well. Although he may not have been the first to codify this key principle, he again seems to have been decades ahead of others in applying this understanding of pathology in his treatment26. Because he believed that these defense mechanisms, activated into disequilibrium, may do more harm than the pathogenic focus itself might, he therefore devoted himself to devise medicaments that would restore normal bodily function. Based upon his earlier studies, he chose to utilize the properties of elements to alter different levels of function, and the ability of lipids to cause longer-lasting alterations, to create a large series of therapeutic compounds in which elements were conjugated into lipids27 : He thereby anticipated, again by decades, interest in lipids as carriers of pharmaceutically useful compounds28. As already noted, his research on \"twin formations\" also heavily influenced his thought on the structure of useful therapeutic agents. Taken altogether, the different paths of research he explored during his life facilitated the development, with foresight and intention, of a great number of therapeutic compounds designed to have particular effects.-on the function of normal and diseased tissues said, then, in summary, and without exaggeration, that Revici developed a theory of rational drug design decades before the concept entered the imagination of the larger scientific community. And this theory helped him to discover, among other therapeutic agents (again, many years before anyone else did), such compounds as organo-selenium drugs for treatment of cancer, AIDS, and other terminal or chronic degenerative diseases. His nontoxic chemotherapy uses lipids, lipid-based substances, and essential elements to correct an underlying imbalance in the patient's chemistry. This was his theory: High tissue/cell cholesterol (TCh), calculated from serum cholesterol results, is a pathologic lipid defense resulting in anaerobic metabolism. High tissue/cell cholesterol(TCh) often corresponds with an elevated LDL cholesterol. Low tissue/cell cholesterol (TCh), calculated from serum cholesterol results, often corresponds to high HDL and/or low LDL cholesterol. Low tissue/cell cholesterol (TCh), indicative of runaway inflammation and lipid peroxidation is seen in, or predicts, autoimmune disease. Pain is either from tissue acidity or tissue alkalinity. The dysaerobic metabolism of pathological fatty acids creates tissue alkalosis. The anaerobic metabolism of pathological sterols and steroids generates acid tissues. The former responds to fatty alcohols that neutralize fatty acids; the latter to reduced sulfur. Lipid-bound minerals are readily absorbed and delivered by red blood cells to sites where a deficiency contributes to pathology. Low serum potassium is often a result of an extra- to intracellular potassium shift..29 Lipids-organic compounds such as fatty acids and sterols-are important constituents of all living cells. They are a separate, critical system in the body's defenses against illness, according to research conducted by Dr. Revici early in his career. Unlike cancer cells, which are only able to transfer sugars into energy, healthy cells are also able to convert fats and proteins into energy30. So eating healthy fats strengthens the healthy cells, but does not feed the cancer cells. The liver primarily uses fatty acid oxidation for energy. Muscle cells use fatty acids,31 glucose, and amino acids32as energy sources. Most cells use glucose for ATP synthesis, but there are other fuel molecules equally important for maintaining the body's equilibrium or homeostasis. 33 Look here to see which fats are healthy and how you can consume them.34 Selenium35 rich foods are Brazil nuts, cottage cheese, eggs, brown rice, sunflower seeds, oatmeal, mushrooms, spinach, milk and yoghurt, lentils, cashews and banana's. Like Johanna Budwig put in her famous porridge to treat cancer patients. Revici's medical findings derived from a number of different lines of investigation, each simple enough by itself. Interwoven, they make a complex body of knowledge.36The starting point was an observation Revici made in the 1920s, while, lilke the 20th century. he was also still in his 20s. During the early years of his clinical research, he noted that cancer patients presenting with pain showed a cycling in their levels of discomfort. Some patients felt more pain in the morning. Others suffered more at night Some patients had their pain relieved by eating, Others found their pain so exacerbated by eating that eating became a fearful experience for them. Revici surmised that any cycling of this nature must be associated with an underlying cycling of the patients' physiology, and he set out to discover what such underlying fluctuations might be. Hypothesizing that this cycling might relate to an underlying cycling of the patients' physiology, Revici looked at various aspects of blood and urine. His investigations showed that healthy persons typically had daily rhythmic fluctuations in such basic physical parameters as urinary pH and levels of free potassium in the blood. In contrast, cancer patients had abnormal fluctuations, showing either patterns of acidic imbalance or alkaline imbalance.37 Further investigation found that patients in acidic imbalance could relieve their pain temporarily by ingesting a small amount of sodium bicarbonate. But patients in alkaline imbalance who ingested sodium bicarbonate suffered worse pain. Repeating the experiment with dilute phosphoric acid gave roughly converse results. Realizing that these small amounts of dilute acid or base wouldn't change bodily pH, Revici next placed platinum electrodes in painful loci of patients with superficial tumors, as well as in non-painful parts of the tumor mass and in normal tissue. All these experiments led Revici to conclude that the pH of painful local lesions was not only different from the rest of the body, but that ingestion of small amounts of base or acid could specifically and quickly alter these painful lesions.38 As a result of these studies, Revici proposed that a crucial distinction be made between pathological pain and what he termed \"physiological pain\" (a distinction supported by many subsequent years of research). To ease pain in his cancer patients, he then turned to developing lipidic means to change pH, recognizing that interventions based on amino acids, ions, or proteins would not last long enough for meaningful relief. Before proceeding, he felt it necessary to redefine lipids (fatty acids and sterols), which were generally regarded in the early 20th century as greasy, water-insoluble substances extractable in ether, a definition that still appears in many biochemistry books.39 Decades ahead of anyone else in the field, Revici described lipids at a molecular level, correctly noting the importance of their polar, hydrophobic carboxyl head 40and non-polar regions. 41 (the methyl tale and the rest of the molecule is non polar) As his career progressed, Revici's definition guided his clinical use of lipids by supplying an accurate structural guide for analysis of therapeutic compounds he wished to create.42 During his European years, Revici also launched into a systematic study of the effects of different elements on bodily function, a research path ending in his categorization of elements as either inducing anabolic or catabolic states of metabolism. Later, he discovered that within a vertical series of the Periodic Table, elements acted similarly - their valency shell partly determined their bioactivity, and the concentration of an element in different organizational levels of the body was both precisely regulated and a key determinant of normal and pathological states.43 By the time he had emigrated to the US, Revici's investigations into the molecular structure of carcinogens and other bioactive molecules had revealed that many bioactive molecules exhibited a charge structure in which adjacent carbon atoms would be predicted to carry identical charges. The concepts Revici evolved from study of these \"twin formations\" (as he termed them), or energetic centers, also played a crucial role in his design of therapeutic agents. As with so much of his work, examination of molecular structures makes one wonder why Revici's American peers resisted this discovery: Flip the pages of the Merck Index, and example after example of bioactive molecules with such an energetic configuration march by.44 Repeatedly, Revici's studies on lipid function pointed the way to findings that predate ideas widely accepted today. Decades before Bengt Samuelsson reported on leukotrienes, earning a Nobel Prize, Revici essentially described them, indicating their crucial role in inflammation.45 This was what the 1987 study Bengt Samuelsson was part of claimed: \"Arachidonic-Acid is released from membrane phospholipids upon cell stimulation (for example, by immune complexes and calcium ionophores) and converted to leukotrienes by a 5-lipoxygenase that also leukotriene leukotriene leukotrienes participate in host defense reactions and pathophysiological conditions such as immediate hypersensitivity and inflammation. Recent studies also suggest a neuroendocrine role for leukotriene C4 in luteinizing hormone secretion. Lipoxins are formed by the action of 5- and 15-lipoxygenases on arachidonic acid. Lipoxin A causes contraction of guinea pig lung strips and dilation of the microvasculature. Both lipoxin A and B inhibit natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Thus, the multiple interaction of lipoxygenases generates compounds that can regulate specific cellular responses of importance in inflammation and immunity46 \". It was characteristic of Revici, though, to view these compounds as part of a much larger picture. Instead of choosing to concentrate on this one topic for years, he swiftly moved on to elucidate the role of bioactive lipids in the early stages of cellular and systemic host defense processes. Intervention by lipids at this level of the body's defenses, he reasoned, might affect outcome and even the extent of mobilization at other levels47. As he developed his theories and applications, Revici incorporated another basic insight: The damage caused by disease frequently isn't done by the pathogenic focus alone, but by the body's defense mechanisms as well. He may not have been the first to codify this key insight as a therapeutic principle, but once more, he seems to have preceded the mainstream in incorporating the principle to treat patients48. Because Revici believed that these defense mechanisms might do more harm than the pathogenic focus itself (once activated into disequilibrium), he devoted himself to devising therapeutic agents that could restore normal bodily function. Based on his European research, he utilized the properties of elements to alter different levels of function and the ability of lipids to induce longer-lasting alterations to create a large series of therapeutic compounds in which elements were conjugated into lipids. He thereby anticipated, again by decades, interest in lipids as carriers of pharmaceutically useful compounds.49 In sum, the different paths of research Revici followed throughout his career enabled him to pioneer, intentionally and with foresight, a great number of therapeutic compounds designed to produce specific effects on the function of normal and diseased tissues. Without exaggeration, then, one may say that he developed a theory of rational drug design long before the concept entered the imagination of the larger scientific community.50 A Nobel Prize was awarded to scientists in 1982 \"for their discoveries concerning prostaglandins and related biologically active substances\"51, a discovery the Burrs, had already written their research paper on in 1929, and with which Dr. Revici and Dr. Johanna Budwig had already worked fifty years earlier. While physicians and scientists have confirmed some of his discoveries in recent decades, many remain unrecognized. The same transformation that occurred in physics a century ago will occur in medicine this century once Dr. Revici's work, the physics of lipids, is appreciated and applied.52 Dr. Revici was also the first physician to develop selenium compounds to give cancer patients and he was among the first research clinicians to treat cancer with naturally derived Omega-3-ALA.5354 Dr. Emanuel Revici has developed an original approach to the treatment of cancer but he was able to heal many other ailments and diseases as wll. Dr Brenner's praise of Emanuel Revici's Method for Curing Cancer In the earlier mentioned lecture55, Revici says he is hopeful that Dr Brenner would be helpful in promoting his research. Dr Brenner, a retired radiation oncologist, wrote the foreword of The Doctor Who Cures Cancer by William Kelley Eidem. From which the following biographical exerpts are taken. It is a very powerful acknowledgment of Dr. Revici's method :56 Dr. Brenner's Foreword to Kelley Eidam's book The Doctor Who Cures Cancer57 Dr. Emanuel Revici treats cancer in a manner unlike any other doctor in the United States and probably in the world. He uses his own medicines. Over the years he has developed over 100 different medications in his own laboratory. I don't know how they work, but I have seen their results. I am a retired board certified radiation oncologist. My practice specialized in the treatment of cancer with radiation. I have fought at the front lines in the war against cancer all of my professional life. During my long tenure of battling cancer for my patients, I gradually became rather frustrated and unhappy with the little progress that has been made in the treatment of this disease After more than forty-years of seeing almost no breakthroughs on the medical front, it became painful seeing my patients every day, knowing that most of them had very little chance for a cure. On numerous occasions I saw patients in tears. Just as often I saw wives crying for their husbands, husbands crying for their wives, and parents crying for their sick children. My combined Brooklyn and Queens offices handled several hundred appointments a week during the last ten-years of my practice, making it the largest cancer radiation oncology center in the nation. Highly regarded physicians whose offices were in the shadows of Sloan-Kettering, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and NYU Medical Center sent their patients to our offices. I was a member of the Cancer and Acute Leukemia Group \"B\", which is the largest nationally funded cancer research group in the United States. Our office provided this organization with statistical data regarding our patients. My practice produced a personal income for me well into the seven-figure range annually. For four decades our offices were technologically state-of-the-art. We repeatedly spent millions of dollars in order to procure the latest and best radiation and diagnostic equipment available. Despite that outward success, I am still saddened from having watched so many people of all ages die. Even with the best possible equipment and a staff of board-certified radiation oncologists, we could only do so much. Sadly, for the population of patients we saw, the odds were against them. Many came to us hoping to be cured. When I examined their records, though, I knew which ones were being treated for a possible cure, and which ones were being treated for palliation (relief of pain). Since 1950, the medical profession has made only minor advances in the therapeutic arena against cancer. The only significant improvement that I saw was in our diagnostic abilities. As a result, some cancers, such as cancer of the breast, colon, uterus and prostate have cure rates of 90% or better if caught in Stage 1. I must state, however, that these four highly curable cancers become incurable if not caught in their early stages - Stages I or Il. Although the overall numbers say you have a fifty-fifty chance of beating cancer, the individual numbers say you either have a 90% chance or very little chance, depending on what stage the cancer is in and its type. Unfortunately, for a few cancers, such as pancreatic cancer, the patient is lucky to live much more than six months, regardless of the treatment. Even with the all-out effort to catch cancer earlier than ever before, the overall five-year cure rate has inched up a paltry 0.7% in the last 40-years. I first became interested in Emanuel Revici M.D., not from the medical literature, but from hard evidence - that is, X-rays taken at my office of one of my patients. I knew his prior condition, because this was a patient we had seen a year earlier. His cancer of the lung had metastasized to his bones. There was no mistaking the improvement in the patient When I saw that his new films showed no evidence of the cancer either in his bones or lungs, I had to find out what caused the remission. The patient told me he had been undergoing treatment by a Dr. Revici in Manhattan. At the time, I was unfamiliar with the gentleman. Still I arranged to meet with him at his office. When I first met Dr. Revici~ he was already 90-years-old. He showed me enough before and after X-rays and CT scans at our first meeting for me to schedule a second one. A few days later he introduced me to three patients who had previously been stricken with incurable cancer. Two of them had been afflicted with pancreatic cancer and the other was previously diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor. Dr. Revici showed me their CT scans both before and after his treatment. The before' pictures showed a suspicious mass for each patient. He also showed me the written biopsy reports from the various hospitals which had confirmed that the abnormal masses were cancerous. The 'after' scans showed no evidence of any abnormality. From all outward appearances, the three patients looked to be healthy. Dr. Revici also showed me copies of the reports from the patients private physicians who confirmed that the patients were now free of cancer. I knew from my own training and experience that modem medicine couldn't have saved those three people. Each of the three patients had an almost zero percent chance of recovery. That all three would be free of cancer led me to think that Dr. Revici's medicines were worth further investigation. Since those early meetings, I have reviewed the records, X-rays, CT scans and biopsy reports of dozens of Dr. Revici's patients. Often, when Dr. Revici provided me with information on a patient I would attempt to confirm it with the patients previous physicians. I soon found out that every time Dr. Revici had provided me with information regarding a patient It would turn out to be correct. As a Diplomat of Radiology I have reviewed many cases of incurable cancer that Dr. Revici has cured. I must admit that his results aren't always 100% but then neither are the results of the approved medical profession 100%. In my entire career of seeing tens of thousands of patients, I have never seen a single case of spontaneous remission, except for misdiagnosed lung cancer. The cases I reviewed at Dr. Revici's office were not misdiagnosed. In my opinion, its unlikely that the positive outcomes I reviewed were the results of multiple spontaneous remissions. I must interject a brief story at this point. When I met Dr. Revici~ I was sixty-two-years-old. My PSA reading, the screening test for prostate cancer, was 6.2. A PSA score of up to 5.0 is normal. Scores from 5.0 to 10.0, need to be watched, as some may indicate the presence of cancer. Above 10.0, there's a greatly elevated chance of cancer. I told Dr. Revici about my PSA score, so he gave me one of his medications. After taking the medicine for a year, my PSA reading fell to 1.6. There were no apparent ill effects. After a few years of being off the medicine, my latest PSA score has inched up to 2.5. After examining the records of a number of his patients, I am now of the opinion that Dr. Revici has something worthy of a thorough clinical trial. I decided to see if I could help Dr. Revici to conduct a large scale test of his method and his medicines. I made a presentation at the Congressional hearing in March of 1988. At that time I proposed a study to test Dr. Revici's method for treating cancer, Once it is approved, the study will include 100 cases of cancer that the medical profession recognizes as incurable: pancreatic cancer, colon cancer with liver metastases, unresectable lung cancer and unresectable brain cancer. The patients are to be selected by five board-certified oncologists who will verify that each patient is incurable, and that his or her life expectancy is less than one year. Sloan-Kettering, NIH, The Mayo Clinic, M.D. Anderson, John Hopkins and many other outstanding research centers accept cancer patients for experimental trials every day. The patients who volunteer often decide to participate because they believe it might give them a chance they might not have otherwise. I believe its time to conduct an experimental trials of Revici's medicines. These patients would have nothing to lose by their participation. From what I have seen, there is the chance that they would have something to gain. Dr. Revici has cured many people who were otherwise considered incurable. It is my professional opinion that his medicines have worked for many of the patients whose records I have examined. Lets find out if more patients and their families can be helped. The fact that he has helped so many people means its time for Mr. and Mrs. America to push for a clinical trial of his method. -Seymour Brenner, M.D., F.A.C.R. Many Doctors Praise Dr. Emanuel Revici He wasn't the only one to praise Dr Emanuel Revici.Below are a few thoughts about Dr. Revici expressed over the years by medical doctors, scientists, researchers and patients. 58 His brilliance as a medical scientist Professor Joseph Maisin (Nethen, Beligium, 1893- Seville Spain, June 1, 1971), 60Director of the Institute of Cancer, University of Louvain,Belgium (former director of the International Union Against Cancer), found Revici's medications effective in numerous terminal cases refractive to other treatment.61 Gerhard N. Schrauzer, PhD (Professor of Chemistry, University of California, La Jolla), an authority on selenium, has credited Revici with \"having discovered pharmacologically active selenium compounds of very low toxicity,\" appraising him as \"an innovative medical genius, outstanding chemist, and a highly creative thinker.\"62 Mark Noble, PhD (Professor of Oncology, University of Utah), a noted cell biologist, is currently \"studying Dr. Revici's work because there is a significant chance that he has created a coherent chain of scientific discoveries\"63 Dr. Emanuel Revici is the Louis Pasteur of our time\u2014brilliant, innovative, compassionate, and always at the vanguard of applied research. A man who has lived long enough to see his ideas benefit tens of thousands\u2014a real treasure! Gary Null, Ph.D. Author, radio talk-show host. There was Hippocrates, there was Galen, and then there was Paracelsus. He is among them. Gerhard Schrauzer, Ph.D. Professor of Chemistry Internationally recognized cancer researcher. (Actually, comparing Revici to Galen is not such a compliment. He was more like Vesalius I would say) Emanuel Revici is widely regarded as an authentic genius of modern medicine. To some he ranks on the order of a Pasteur. [He is] sometimes regarded as the Nikola Tesla of medicine. Robert G. Houston Award-winning science writer and researcher Consultant on alternative cancer therapies for ABC, Metromedia, PBS, and WNBC from Repression and Reform In The Evaluation of Alternative Cancer Therapies, Project Cure, Inc. My father, who was the science editor of the American Cancer Society for 25 years, and I met with Dr. Revici for the first time on a summer's day in the mid 1970's. After two hours of discussion, we left and walked down Park Avenue. I said, \"I have to confess I didn't understand a word that man said.\" He said, \"I didn't understand one word either, but I am absolutely convinced\u2014that man is a genius.\" Patrick M. McGrady Jr. Former Moscow bureau chief for Newsweek director of CANHELP, a cancer-patient information and referral service Genius is seeing what everyone else sees and thinking what no one else thinks. Revici is a genius. Robert Fishbein, M.D. 34-year survivor of terminal brain cancer under Dr. Revici's care Revici is 50 to 100 years ahead of his time in his knowledge of steroids. His work with steroids alone is earth shattering. I'm not fit to tie his shoelaces. In a hundred years people will say, \"Isn't it a shame the way people treated Revici when he was alive?\" Morris Mann, M.D. Researcher and independent inventor. I saw his book and a thousand lights went on. It's part of how I think. Lynn August, M.D. referring to Revici's textbook. Dr. Revici's work is an excellent example of advances in medicine that are far beyond the scope of orthodox medicine. Robert Atkins, M.D. Atkins Center for Complimentary Medicine Author of Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution His results with cancer and AIDS You requested that I look into Dr. Revici's treatment of cancer. This I did, and find it far beyond my wildest expectations.... His results are amazing... Louis E. Burns, M.D. Dr. Revici has cured many people who were otherwise considered incurable. It is my professional opinion that his medicines have worked for many of the patients whose records I have examined. Seymour Brenner, M.D., F.A.C.R. Former head of the largest radiation oncology center in the United States. I've known him for ten years. I don't know how he does it, but people walk in dead and walk out alive. John Heller, M.D. Former Medical Director of Sloan-Kettering Memorial Cancer Center I know of no conventional oncologist who can match his results. Patrick M. McGrady Jr. from \"The Cancer Patient's Quandary\", The Newsday Magazine, I tracked down over 200 of Dr. Revici's cases. I studied this man's work for 15 years. I refused to write an article about him for ten years until I had absolute proof from my own investigation that [these] patients had cancer...it was his treatment that put them into remisssion, and they were alive and well ten years later. Gary Null, Ph.D. Dr. Revici has been working in my laboratory for two years...It is vital that his research be continued without interruption, for the results obtained by Dr. Revici open a multiplicity of new paths to research of all kinds, particularly in the field of cancer. Roger. Leroux, M.D. Professor of Pathologic Anatomy Faculty of Medicine in Paris Deputy Director of the Institute of Cancer of Villejuif Dr. Revici's research in lipids and their therapeutic application in HIV infection and AIDS has proved to be extremely effective\u2014a fact reflected by improvement of \"T\" lymphocyte counts and clinical conditions as well. His work is definitely promising and opens vast areas of investigation and study in the field. Carolina Stamu, M.D. While many European and American Pharmaceutical companies are looking at protease inhibitors and transcriptease, we feel the real good investment lies on the treatment protocols like what you and Dr. Corsello are doing, a model that has positioned James Mobb as the only Southern African Centre getting wheelchaired AIDS patients back to their work places in weeks. Richard Ngwenya, M.D. Harare, Zimbabwe Referring to protocols developed by the Revici Life Science Center (1997) When I worked with Revici in the early and mid-eighties, I saw terminal AIDS patients who improved. Some lived almost normal lives. A.R. Salman, M.D. There were people who came in who had AIDS who looked like they were at death's door. You came back a month or two later, and the difference in terms of their improvement was just incredible. He didn't rescue them all but, my Lord, he pulled a lot of people out. Robert Wilden, a Revici patient and a nine-year victor over cancer of the jaw Lastly, there is the list of cancer patients in the U.S., spanning half a century, reportedly in long-term remission under his method of treatment after failing to benefit in any way from accepted modes of therapy. Now, it is officially recognized that the nutrients he used in his therapy do indeed cure cancer.64 Revici's results with drug and alcohol addiction The results and what we witnessed [were] so unbelievable that the doctor from Municipal Hospital has now gone back on a daily basis in order to continue with this chance to see the miraculous results that have taken place. Congressman Charles Rangel U.S. Congressional Select Committee on Crime Hearing April 1971. Referring to Revici's success with drug addiction. All the patients are drug addicts\u2014heavy long-term users... Normally they should be climbing the walls, vomiting incessantly, clutching their bellies in the agony of withdrawal. Despite the assurances they have received, they seem surprised that they aren't suffering. \"I feel fine, doctor,\" they all say, as Dr. Revici questions them. \"No problems.\" David A. Loehwing, Barron's Sept. 11, 1972 Reporting on patients' experiences with Revici's detoxification methods for drug addiction. His alleviation of pain without the use of narcotics I forgot how much pain there is. I was absolutely shocked by the amount of pain that was there at a very good research hospital. They were screaming in the halls. They were lying on the floor tearing up sheets. With Revici, which were really all terminal cases, there was really very little pain. Lawrence LeShan, Ph.D. Author of Cancer as a Turning Point Comparing Walter Reed Hospital with Revici's Trafalgar Hospital. ...in cases of patients afflicted with grave surgical conditions...the results obtained in the most hopeless of cases were always the amelioration of pain, and quite often the progressive disappearance of large tumors. Dr. Revici's research must be continued and fostered, and may change the therapy of tumors completely. Dr. Chifoliau Honored Member of Hospitals of Paris Member of the French Academy of Surgery ... the thing that impressed me more than anything else is the fact that every patient in this institution is free of, or practically free of, pain without the use of narcotics. In my opinion, if he has nothing else, this ability to relieve intractable pain is a great contribution. C.A. Calhoun, M.D. His dedication to his patients I have never seen a more dedicated physician. I have never known before a physician who told every charge nurse in the hospital that if he was needed at any time, by any patient, he should be called and, to my personal knowledge, if he was called at two, three or four in the morning, he was always there within twenty minutes. Lawrence LeShan, Ph.D. You could call him at home any day, at any time. We called him three times on Christmas day, including at 6:41 in the morning and 9:14 at night, plus at 6:30 in the evening on Christmas Eve. I kept a tab on all the calls we made. It totaled 437 calls. Pierce and Allan Hamilton, parents of Andrew Hamilton, patient. Dr. Revici heard about a patient who was too sick to come and see him. He paid the man a house call, walking up five flights of stairs. Revici was ninety-three. Marcus Cohen Revici historian His effect on the future of medicine His lifework is a rich vein of gold waiting to be mined. Dwight L. McKee, M.D. Whether you are a medical or a non-medical person, when you hear the stories of these cases, when you see the x-rays of bones eaten away by cancer and then returning to normal, how can one but believe?

On September 6, 1896, from that land of simplicity and royalty, of farmers and kings, in Bucharest, Romania, was born perhaps the greatest medical scientist this world has ever known. Some memories fade with the passage of a century of life. Still, there are a few that have stayed with Dr. Revici and that seem to have influenced his entire life. At the age of ninety-eight Dr. Revici told me about a few of them. His father, Tullius Revici, M.D., was a physician whose practice ranged from members of the nobility to the local peasantry. Emanuel showed an early spark of interest in his father's profession. \"My father had a microscope. We started playing,\" Dr. Revici would tell me. Because of Emanuel's interest, Tullius and his son had many conversations about the practice of medicine. As a boy Emanuel seemed to need little sleep and would often stay up half the night. He sometimes watched curiously as his father would go out late at night to see patients. Once, when Emanuel was young, he waited for his father's return and asked him how much he was paid for the long, late-night house call. Tullius told his son he had not charged the patient because the family had little money. It was a lesson Emanuel would remember and would put into practice during his entire professional career. When Emanuel was ten, he told his father he wanted to be a physician. Tullius asked him why he would want to follow in his father's footsteps. Emanuel told him, \"I want to help people.\" His father pushed him on his answer, \"Is it because you also think you can make a good living?\" \"No, I want to help people, only that,\" Emanuel answered. Tullius was finally satisfied, \"I'm glad you answered this way. If you had told me you also wanted to make a lot of money, I would have been disappointed.\" At the age of twelve, Emanuel took on the task of writing four medical books about the human body. He said he stopped at the fifth book, which would have been about the brain, because he found it too difficult. His father told him he was too young to be writing about such things, although one might guess he was secretly pleased. Emanuel's apparent intelligence and his interest in medicine could not be denied for long, however. By the age of sixteen he began to attend the Bucharest School of Medicine\u2014a full four years ahead of the average first-year student. Revici was pulled out of his second year of medical school to serve as a field doctor in what would become World War I. He saw many soldiers die. \"The trenches were dug in a straight line,\" he said, \"so one shell killed many.\" Seventy-five years later Revici recounted a story of an event that would change his life. On a day like so many others, his squad traveled down a road with their horse-drawn ambulances. In addition to himself, his ambulance carried a medic and a wounded soldier. He called for the caravan to stop. Lieutenant Revici climbed out and went off into the woods to relieve himself. Within seconds the group was attacked, and at least one shell hit his ambulance. Both men inside were killed, as was the man riding on top of the ambulance. The two horses that were hitched to the ambulance were also killed in the shelling. After Revici returned to Bucharest and the story was told, he was taken off this front-line detail and reassigned to the hospital\u2014possibly because he was so young, or perhaps because his intelligence was recognized as something that should not be lost. He found himself in trouble almost right away. Revici, who specialized in bacteriology while in medical school, quickly realized that too-high a number of patients were dying from apparent infection. He performed some pathological autopsies on a few of the dead and found that the cause of death was cholera, a condition that was believed to have been previously eradicated. His discovery did not sit well with certain higher-ups. Fortunately, even at his early age, Revici had gained the respect of some of the more senior people at the hospital, including Professor D. Danielopolu, chairman of medicine and a member of the French Academy, who said, \"I know Dr. Revici. His specialty is bacteriology. If he says it's cholera, then that's what it is.\" Through further investigation, Revici was able to track down the probable source of the outbreak to a patient from a remote area who had come in contact with some refugees from Russia. When the war ended, Revici returned to medical school, from where he would graduate at the top of his class in 1920. Because of his number-one class ranking, he was automatically offered a teaching position at the university. He accepted the offer and within a few years he would become an assistant professor there.68 Revici also opened his own medical practice. His father's habit of treating whoever needed his services would become a hallmark of Dr. Revici's practice. In seventy-four years as a practicing physician, he would never turn away any patient because he or she was too sick or too poor. Like his father before him, his patients came from all walks of life. At first his patients would include the farmers and villagers of Romania. His willingness to treat the poor would continue throughout his life. Yet, like his father, the well-to-do also came to see him. Years later he would treat more than three thousand drug addicts, most of whom were from Harlem. In the meantime, he also treated some of the world's luminaries including Oscar winners Anthony Quinn and Gloria Swanson; the Broadway star Gertrude Lawrence; the Archbishop of Ephesus, Lorenzo Michelle DeValich; the Dalai Lama; the wife of the Russian ambassador to Mexico; and the sister of a close advisor to the president of France. Yet as much as he loved his patients, he also had a deeply curious mind. Throughout most of his life he slept only two to four hours a night. During his waking hours he devoted himself to trying to find answers to the scientific questions that perplexed him. As Dr. A. R. Salman, a former Revici associate, who is now the chief physician of Emerald Coast Hospital in Florida, would recently say, \"He didn't go out to movies or dance. He devoted seven days a week, all of his life to his patients, his family and his research.\" How Dr Emanuel Revici became aware of the role of linoleic and alpha linolenic acid as a cure for cancer The incident that precipitated his lifelong work in cancer came from a most unlikely series of events. During his time as a professor, Revici saw on the operating table a young, pregnant woman, surgically opened up, whose abdomen was full of cancer. The surgeon closed her up, thinking she didn't have long to live. Dr. Revici never expected to see her alive again. Two years later, in 1928, the apparently healthy woman returned to see Revici with her small child. Revici wondered how it was possible for the woman to still be alive. The mystery would not leave his mind. He thought and thought about it\u2014a task he is very good at. Several patients have commented on Revici's ability to literally submerge himself in their charts. He becomes quiet and looks slightly downward, sometimes closing his eyelids, as if he were constructing something in mid-air right in front of his eyes. Whether he used the same approach to ponder the mystery of the pregnant woman is not known. Still, the question that occurred to no one else became his primary interest. He knew that neither exploratory surgery nor pregnancy by themselves would have a curative effect on the course of a malignant tumor, so he theorized about the possibility that her dramatic recovery was due to the simultaneous occurrence of both events. He began to study the placenta and noticed that it was rich in fat-soluble products called lipids. He then experimented with animals, testing different placental lipids to see if they would have any effect on the course of cancer. Those lipids produced some tumor reductions for short periods of time, but the tumor growth would often return. In other cases, the lipids produced an increase in tumor activity. He went to the literature to learn what he could about lipids, but found that there was very little written about them. That did not stop him, however. He devoted what spare time he could to the question\u2014usually in the dead of night. Meanwhile, he continued handling his professorial duties and caring for his patients in his successful medical practice. Revici's active mind would lead him in other directions as well. Revici's other ventures: Revoil Dr. Emanuel Revici developed a method for purifying motor oil that was far superior to anything available at the time. The process was especially good for the higher purification requirements necessary to produce aviation quality oil. As Dr. Salman has said with awe, \"The man knows some chemistry.\" He knew chemistry so well that he was offered the equivalent of five million dollars by an oil company for the patent. Revici decided to hold on to the patent. With the help of relatives, a small oil refinery was started, \"It cost us about six lei per liter, and we received fifty-six lei for it.\" The new product was called \"Revoil\". Revici lost much of his income from his invention during the second World War. With the Communist takeover of Romania after the war, he no longer received any income from it. The Revoil process continues to be used today\u2014to refine both aviation and automobile motor oils. Paris from 1936 The income derived from Revoil gave Revici the freedom to go to Paris to further his cancer research. He left for Paris in 1936. He was followed by his wife, Dida, the following year. Their daughter, Nita, who had learned French while attending a Romanian boarding school, joined them in Paris in 1938 at the age of nine. According to Nita, now a medical editor with a Ph.D. in physiology, \"We were living in one spacious room. My father came home for dinner. He took me to school. It was quite wonderful. I had both my parents.\"69 From 1936 to 1941, following resettlement in France, he continued his studies at academic and hospital laboratories directed by prominent Parisian physicians.70 The Pasteur Institute was the most important and prestigious medical center in the world at that time and today remains one of the world's leading medical research institutes. The competition to get scientific papers published at the Institute was extremely high. 5 Papers published at the Pasteur Institute in 1937 brought instant fame to Emanuel Revici In 1937 Revici submitted five papers on lipids and cancer to the Pasteur Institute with the hope that the Institute would consider publishing one of them. Revici's summaries concerned novel observations on lipids and cancer.71All five were accepted\u2014two in 1937 and three in 1938. His reputation soared as a result, and he was called upon by numerous doctors to treat some of their most difficult cases. In the course of being invited to treat other physicians' patients, Revici was offered the French Legion of Honor. The offer came as a result of his reversing the cancer of the wife of an advisor to the president of France. Revici declined to accept the honor, because he felt that such honors were political in nature. A second offer of a French Legion of Honor would come as well. Revici had turned over to the French government the patents to a number of his inventions with the idea that they were to be used in the fight against the invading Nazis. Once again, Revici declined the honor.72 Revici's Lab Accident, 1939 While Nita was away at a camp during the Summer of 1939, Revici had a serious lab accident, jabbing himself with a needle containing an aggressive virus. The virus settled in the part of Dr. Revici's brain that controlled his breathing. He was placed into an iron lung, and his chances for a complete recovery were dim. He rallied, however, and was released. The illness has never entirely left Dr. Revici. For the past twenty years he has developed pneumonia at least once a year, probably as a result of the lab accident. Fortunately, he has always had his own antiviral medicines with which to treat himself. So far, the 100-year-old patient has pulled through each time. Dr. Salman reports of a time when Dr. Revici was in his mid-eighties and sick with pneumonia. Revici insisted that Dr. Salman give him an injection of one of the lipid medications. Within 15 minutes he began to improve. After 24 hours Revici had completely recovered. 73 Paris in the 30's Revici's Development of non-toxic lipid chemotherapy to treat cancer, pain and many other symptomsand diseases He laid the groundwork for a transformation in medicine during his research at the Pasteur Institute in Paris in the 1930's. By observing the energetic properties of lipids in health and disease, Dr. Revici inventive non-toxic lipid chemotherapy that effectively treats pain and cancer, as well as many other symptoms and diseases. Omega-3-ALA and Omega-6-LA were the lipids he used. 74 War years: Revici in The French Resistance against the German Occupation As World War II loomed, French academic physicians encouraged him to continue his studies, occasionally requesting him to apply his laboratory findings to terminal cancer patients under their care. These therapeutic experiments, said one doctor, always resulted in relief of pain and often in tumor regression.75 Twenty years after the Second World War, a member of the high command of the Resistance in southern France recalled Dr. Revici's clandestine service in the Underground: \"Revici volunteered in our resistance in which we badly needed secret help. Revici risked his life doing such jobs. He could have been arrested any time...His wife would have been deported...I never forgot his quiet courage and the lives he saved.\" His service with the French Resistance during World War 11 obliged leaders of the Underground to provide him refuge from Hitler's reign76 outside of Europe. 77 World War II aborted his French career. The first part of this series on Revici recounted his eleventh-hour escape from the German forces occupying the French capitol. (The Nazis were rounding up Jews in Paris for deportation to death camps. Revici, who was Jewish, had retained his Romanian citizenship, and Romania was fighting on Germany's side. Such \"distinctions\" would have counted for naught had the Nazis landed him in their nets.) Fleeing with his wife and daughter to Nice in Vichy, France, Revici bore with him letters of recommendation written on the eve of flight in March 1941. Dr. Roger Leroux wrote: \"Dr Revici has been working in my laboratory for two years. He is carrying on a program of very interesting research of a physiopathological nature on the metabolism of lipids. He has brought to this question several new ideas of the greatest interest. It is vital that his research be continued without interruption, for the results obtained by Dr. Revici open a multiplicity of new paths to research of all kinds, particularly in the field of cancer.\" Leroux was Professor of Pathologic Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Paris. Dr. Chifoliau extolled Revici: \"On several occasions, in cases of patients afflicted with grave surgical conditions, I requested the aid of Dr. Revici, who willingly applied to our patients the results of his laboratory research. The result obtained in most hopeless cases were always the amelioration of pain and quite often, the progressive disappearance of large tumors. Dr. Revici's research must be continued and fostered, and may change the therapy of tumors completely.\" Chifoliau was an Honored Member of the Hospitals of Paris and a Member of the Academy of Surgery of France. Fellow leaders of the Underground sped Revici and his family out of Europe in the Fall of 1941.78 Revici Opens a Free clinic in Mexico, 1942 Mexico agreed to entry visas, and by early 1942, the Revicis had resettled in Mexico City. Encouraged by his friend Gaston Merry, Revici converted a modern 100-room hotel into a medical institute devoted to his lipid research. Formerly the European representative for E.I. Du Pont de Nemours, Merry was a chemical engineer who had grown interested in Revici's study of lipids while both were in Paris. (Du Pont had long positioned itself in the business world as a multinational combine specializing in chemical research and manufacture.) Revici's Mexico City institute had 15 qualified physicians and chemists on staff, with 60 support personnel. Most of the doctors and chemists were Mexican, but several eminent European physicians, surgeons, and scientists also in refuge, signed on. He established and directed a free clinic, staffing it with fellow physicians-in-exile and local physicians. The facilities included a hospital equipped with the latest technology, a clinical lab, a research department with eight labs, a section for experiments on animals, and an outpatient clinic. 79The clinic, which contained over 100 rooms, mainly attended to cancer patients.80 Concentrating on Revici's explorations of lipid metabolism and disease, the researchers studied sulfur81 incorporated into lipids for antibiotic use, fatty acids as factors in arteriosclerosis, and shock. The work on cancer focused on treatment of terminal cases with lipid extracts.82 Revici's Invitation to the US in 1946 In 1946, Dr. George Dick, dean of the medical school, Chicago University, invited Revici to carry forward his research in the U.S. 83 Dr. George Dick (1881-1967), now you see me, now you don't This is odd. If Dr George Dick invited Revici in 1946 to come do research tocome to research at the University of Chicago, because he was already not the head of the department of medicine there then. In recognition of both his assistance to the French Underground and the potential of his scientific discoveries, Sumner Welles, a high-level aid to President Franklin Roosevelt, arranged with the U.S. Consulate in Mexico to grant special visas to speed the entry of Revici and his family.86 Mr. Welles, a diplomat, had served in the Roosevelt Administration as Undersecretary of State from 1937 to 1942. The diplomat who arranged Revici's coming to America, Benjamin Sumner Welles( 1892-1961) Born in New York City to a wealthy, well-connected political family, Welles graduated from Harvard College in 1914. He entered the Foreign Service at the advice of Franklin Roosevelt, who was a family friend. Welles was excited by Woodrow Wilson's ideas about how American principles could reorder the international system based on liberal democracy, free-trade capitalism, international law, a league of nations, and an end to colonialism. Welles specialized in Latin American diplomatic affairs and served several posts in Washington and in the field. President Calvin Coolidge distrusted Welles because of his divorce and private sex life. He left public service and from bases in his two mansions in the Washington area he wrote a book on the history of the Dominican Republic. When Roosevelt was elected president in 1932, he put Welles in charge of Latin American affairs as Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs, Welles became heavily involved in negotiations that removed Cuban president Gerardo Machado from power and replaced him with rival Carlos Manuel de C\u00e9spedes y Quesada. He was later promoted to Under Secretary of State, in which role he continued to be active in Latin American issues, but also expanded into European affairs as World War II began in Europe in 1939. In 1940, he issued the Welles Declaration which condemned Soviet occupation of the Baltic states and proved to be a minor point of contention among the Soviets and their Western allies once the U.S. entered the war in 1941. Welles used American power and his senior position to intrude into the domestic affairs of other countries, especially choosing leaders who supported American policies. After the fall of France, he downgraded French affairs because they no longer were a major power. Roosevelt relied on Welles much more than on the official Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, who became the enemy of Welles. Welles was forced out of government service by Secretary Hull when it was revealed he had solicited two men for sex. Returning to private life, he continued to write books on foreign relations and became an advisor to media organizations. He was a target of the House Un-American Activities Committee during the post-war \"red scare\", though he was never formally sanctioned. He died in New Jersey in 1961, survived by his third wife and several children Dr. George Dick resigned suddenly the next year88, that's what the Townsend letter says. But the next year would be 1947, while he already resigned in 1945. After that Revici promptly accepted an invitation from physicians, businessmen, and civic leaders to found an experimental cancer clinic in New York City 89. However, another source says he founded the Institute of Applied Biology himself after being stranded in the US. New York Institute of Applied Biology 1947-1990, After 1990 Revici Life Sciences The clinic, named the Institute of Applied Biology (IAB), opened later in 1947. He earned his medical license in New York by examination in the same year and maintained his dual career as a scientist and physician in New York City .Revici served as scientific director, a position he held until the Institute of Applied Biology ceased operations in 1990. After that he started Revici Life Sciences90 In the US, Revici repeatedly tried to inform doctors about his research on lipids in physiopathology through peer-reviewed journals and scientific conferences, but elements in the medical establishment frustrated his efforts. 91 Revici's publishing Career Revici had a flying start with his publishing career when this 5 reseacrh papers were published by the Louis Pasteur Instutute in 1937. In the U.S. he was brutally sabotaged. After some thirty years of research Dr Revici wrote a 772 page textbook: Research in Pathophysiology as Basis for Guided Chemotherapy, with Special Application to Cancer. 92 He also authorized over thirty articles on the treatment of cancer. Soon after he set up his free clinic in Mexico City, and from the moment he co-established the Institute of Applied Biology in N.Y. Revici sought to disseminate his theories and therapeutic results.93 He published papers, often in co-authorship, in peer-reviewed journals.94 He and his colleagues presented papers on different aspects of his research before scientific and medical organizations. 95 These attempts to acquaint, the medical community with his studies at the Institute of Applied Biology encountered resistance. In particular, correspondence and articles critical of his method of cancer treatment, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1945 and 1949, severely hindered wider circulation of information about him and damaged his capability to raise funds and operate normally. 96 Revici claimed that the letter appearing in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1945, warning against his Mexican clinic, contradicted favorable reports in the private correspondence of the signatories to the public letter; and the Journal of the American Medical Association did print a brief rebuttal from the Institute of Applied Biology pointing out that pivotal contradiction in 1949. 97 The Institute of Applied Biology sued a local arm of the American Cancer Society, the Brooklyn Cancer Society, for libel in 1949 when the Brooklyn Cancer Society circulated an excerpt from the 1949 Journal of the American Medical Association piece. The suit was settled through arbitration the same year 98, and the arbitrator, the president of the Medical Society of the State of New York, apparently impressed by the potential of Revici's treatment, subsequently joined the Institute of Applied Biology's board of directors.99 In July, 1961, the D. Van Nostrand Co. brought out his 772-page textbook, Research in Physiopathology as Basis for Guided Chemotherapy, With Special Application to Cancer.100 Teeming with ideas constituting the conceptual bases for his method of treatment (while mostly appending his experimental and clinical data as footnotes), the book summarized his life work from the mid-1920s through the 1950s.101 Release of Revici's text in July of 1961 by a publishing house long known for the quality of its scientific books marks the high point in his efforts to convince the U.S. medical community of the value of his research; but in April of that same year, the American Cancer Society had placed him on its \"unproven methods\" list, and few physicians, researchers, or medical libraries purchased his text once it became available.102 The American Cancer Society in the section about Revici in its literature on unproven methods of cancer management alludes to evaluations of his therapy at the University of Wisconsin and Chicago University in the mid-1940s.103 The extant documentation from this period suggests the American Cancer Society has mistaken informal visits to his Mexican clinic by physicians associated with the University of Wisconsin for a formal investigation. The documentation also suggests that the American Cancer Society has attributed to Revici a test of his treatment at Chicago University that a colleague at this university appears to have attempted. There is no contemporaneous evidence that Revici treated any patients there .104 In its phrasing of actual negotiations with the National Research Council to evaluate him in the early 1950s, the American Cancer Society creates the impression that Revici and his associates at the Institute of Applied Biology refused to accept scientifically appropriate protocols for clinical trials.105 The documents from parties on both sides, compared carefully, do not support the American Cancer Society's interpretation of the collapse of Institute of Applied Biology/N.R.C. negotiations .106 An unpublished description detailing Revici's approach to cancer treatment, prepared by an associate in 1962, refers to a June meeting with the National Cancer Institute to explore a prospective National Cancer Institute evaluation .107 The National Cancer Institute. presumably declined, because Revici next entered into discussions for a clinical appraisal by oncologists associated with two medical institutions in New York City. The protocols they worked out divided the oncologists into roughly even groups: one group to observe patients refractory to mainstream therapy treated by Revici and his staff at his inpatient facility; the other group to administer his treatment to similar patients at their own hospital. Each group was to publish their conclusions separately. The 2-page summary report of this evaluation published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in November, 1965, stating that no benefit resulted from his treatment in the 33 patients studied, devastated him and undermined his support among the trustees of his inpatient facility.108 He wrote a massive point-by-point rebuttal, profusely documented, which the Journal of the American Medical Association rejected (needing no reason beyond its length). The Office of Technology Assessment (U.S. Congress), in its report about unconventional cancer treatments, condenses his rebuttal to its essential points, saying that he \"presented summaries of patient records that he claimed showed objective responses to treatment, contradicting the C.A.G.'s interpretation of the same data,\" and that \"he noted, among other things, that several patients in the study had tumor remissions that the study group allegedly failed to recognize.\"109 The American Cancer Society, in a recent revision of its piece putting Revici on its unproven methods list, airs an objection by him omitted by the Office of Technology Assessment; \"that he had been excluded from the group's deliberations\".110 The documents, showing that the two groups violated the protocols by merging into one group and signing their names to one report, indicate that his contention seems solidly grounded (Francis Delafield Hospital, \"Delafield Clinical Appraisal Protocol,\" undated). Now, 33 years after the appearance of the Clinical Appraisal Group's summary, enough time has passed to note additional, currently more pertinent \"flaws.\" The C.A.G. trial fell far below the 11 gold standard\" for such trials \u2014 a randomized, controlled, blinded study; it was a simple observational study, without controls, without randomization, without blinding of the evaluators to avoid bias. Moreover, besides being subject to bias, it occurred a generation ago! Which makes it, in the eyes of today's literature-saturated researchers, a relic of \"ancient\" history. In 1990, Seymour Brenner, a board-certified radiation oncologist: in private practice in New York City, presented a retrospective \"best case study\" of Revici's cancer patients before the Office of Technology Assessment. The Office of Technology Assessment had convened a special meeting to enable critics of the final draft of its report on unconventional cancer treatments to suggest corrections. Brenner discussed 10 cases, documented by him (but not subjected to rigorous peer review), which he believed to be in remarkable remission; and the Office of Technology Assessment added his study to its section on evaluations of Revici (Office of Technology Assessment, 1990). The Office of Technology Assessment report cites a much earlier evaluation warranting mention, an unpublished paper by Robert A. Ravich, MID, written while still a junior colleague of Revici at the Institute of Applied Biology. The paper summarizes the results in all 1,047 cases treated at the Institute of Applied Biology from its founding to 1955. The Office of Technology Assessment devotes considerable space to discussion of Ravich's review, detailing his criteria for inclusion of patients, his classification of treatment groups according to Revici's method for determining the predominant anabolic or catabolic imbalance present in each case, and his \"tabulation\" of objective and subjective responses to treatment (Office of Technology Assessment 199 0). Since congressional establishment of the Office of Alternative Medicine in the National Institutes of Health (the O.A.M.) in 1992, the Office of Alternative Medicine in the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration have cooperated in developing a protocol to test Revici's therapeutic agents. Recently, the Center for Alternative Medicine at the University of Texas (Houston), signed on to assist. These papers summarized observations Revici had made about the influence of lipids in pathological pain and cancer. In 1943, a year after establishing his Institute in Mexico City, Revici sought to acquaint visiting US physicians with his findings, hoping they would assist in publishing them in peer-reviewed English-language journals. His associate and friend Gaston Merry, in a personal letter dated September 5, 1945, aired his suspicion that the US doctors had intended to publish Revici's findings as their own. August 18, 1945 backstabbing letter, signed by those very same physicians Perhaps with that aim in mind, these physicians took a glancing swipe at Revici. The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), August 18, 1945, printed a letter signed by these physicians under the heading, \"A Mexican Treatment For Cancer\u2014A Warning.\" The letter, not referring to Revici by name, disparaged both his theories and results. \"What seems to be behind the paper,\" Gaston Merry wrote, \"is the desire to work along the ideas of Revici and to claim the paternity of some of his ideas. Physicians who spent time at Revici's Mexican Clinic stole his ideas and passed them off as their own and signed the slanderous letter against Revici fro August 18 1945 A hint is given by an article published in Cancer Research on page 480 of the August number and called 'The Effects of 3-4 Benzpyrene on the Auto Oxidation signed by G.C. Meuller and H.P. Rusch, the latter being the doctor from Wisconsin who came at the end of 1943 to spend about 5 weeks here and who came again at the end of 1944.\" \"His article,\" continued Gaston Merry, \"is the reproduction of an experiment made in Paris, the conclusions of which having been published at two or three occasions. When Dr. Rusch was here in December 1943, I was present at the conversations as an interpreter, and Revici candidly discussed his findings at length, mentioning specifically the linoleic and alpha-linolenic-acids which are also the ones used by Dr. Rusch who took plenty of notes during the conversations. As you know, according to Revici's classification, 3-4 Benzpyrene is one of the first bodies to be considered as Lipobase. Dr. Rusch does not go so far as to talk about Lipobases and Lipoacids but his method is a close reproduction of the technique mentioned by our friend. I am afraid that all the notes taken 18 months ago and later will serve as subjects for publications which so far could not be made from here.\" Gaston Merry ended: \"I guess the best thing would be to liquidate what we have here and have Revici working in a laboratory in the States with the proper help to repeat all his experiments in support of his theory and especially the suitable collaboration for writing up the publications. It is a great handicap for him that his English is too poor for writing the necessary articles. This is what we asked for when the Texas and Wisconsin gang came here but they acted deaf.\"111 1945 Revici tricked into going to the US In 1945, Revici received an invitation by George Dick to come work at the University of Chicago. Lab assistant Gustave Freeman, a lab assistant at the Unversity of Chicago had arranged this invitation. However, George Dick resigned suddenly, and his successor was hostile to Revici and his methods. Stranded in the US, Revici founded the Insititute of Applied Biology in 1947together with Urologist Abraham Ravich. Abraham Ravich's son Robert joined them . This will be discussed in more detail later. From the moment Revici co-established the Institute of Applied Biology in Brooklyn, New York, in 1947, the Institute reported on its investigational programs. Summaries of Revici's findings prior to the opening of the Institute of Applied Biology appeared in booklet form, printed and bound in blue paper covers, with each booklet devoted to a single subject. Itemizations of new or ongoing studies periodically circulated as mimeographed typescripts. For example, \"Report on the Research Conducted at the Institute of Applied Biology,\" issued 10/15/48 by the Cancer Research and Hospital Foundation (the IAB's funding arm), listed over 20 different experiments. \"The fixation of oxygen, sulfur, and selenium in unsaturated fatty acids\" was the second experiment in this itemization. The 21st experiment was \"The influence of lipids in healing of tissue injured by radium emanation.\"112 October 11 1948, Request from the US Navy for Revici's Cure for radiation damage Revici's research on radiation injury had blipped onto the US Navy's radar screen 18 months earlier. A letter from a Colonel Thomas G. Cassady, dated just four days before the Institute of Applied Biology report, confirmed the Navy's interest: (Military scientists were testing nuclear weapons on isolated atolls in the Pacific Ocean in the late 1940s, seeking to protect servicemen on the battlefront from lethal radioactive fallout.)113 \"I have had several conversations,\" Cassady wrote, \"at the Naval Medical Research Center at Bethesda, MD, regarding Dr. Revici...About a year-and-a-half ago ...they had conversations with the Doctor. They were interested in his research work and offered him certain facilities...As well as I could, in my layman's language, I told them of his further research in the matter in question. They will see him again as it is their policy to leave no stone unturned in seeking relief or a possible cure for the type of injury in which the Doctor has made some progress.114 Twice in the late 1940s, the Office of Naval Intelligence cleared Revici to work on this top-secret project. Twice he declined, preferring to work on radiation primarily in relation to the broad problem of cancer. Between July 1950 and June 1951, three papers about Revici's findings on lipids and radiation came to the attention of the clinical research community. Abraham Ravich's son, Robert Ravich, at the Institute of Applied Biology (fresh out of the College of Physicians & Surgeons, Columbia University), read a paper by Revici at the Sixth Annual Congress of Radiology in London on July 26, 1950. Titled \"The Influence of Irradiation Upon Unsaturated Fatty Acids.\" This on 1987.115 Revici didn't use the terms \"leukotrienes\" or \"prostaglandins\" here, but in later publications, he indicated the role these substances play in inflammation, and he attributed the high bioactivity of prostaglandins to a \"twin formation which appears through the cyclization of arachidonic acid.\" Dr. Robert Ravich presented another paper by Revici (co-authored by Robert Ravich) before the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Cincinnati in December 1950. The paper bore the title, \"The Effect of n-Butanol in Sodium Salt Solutions Upon Shock and the Survival of Mice Exposed to Severe Thermal Burns.\"116 Waldemar Kaempffert, a senior science writer for The New York Times, devoted a column to Ravich's presentation in the March 4, 1951 issue of the Times, stressing the potential value of Revici's findings on radiation injury should American cities be hit by A-bombs.117 \"Fall-out\" from a paper delivered by Leonard Goldman, MD, at a meeting of the American Medical Association in Atlantic City, NJ, in June 1951 marked the first documented instance of mainstream opposition to independent clinicians trying to follow Revici's line of research. Notice of Goldman's study, titled the \"Use of Lipids to Enhance the Effect of Roentgen Therapy in the Treatment of Pain from Advanced Cancer,\" 118made its way into a dossier that the American Cancer Society (ACS) maintained on Revici. The dossier was labeled, \"Summary of information contained in the American Cancer Society, Inc.'s files concerning the Institute of Applied Biology and Dr. Emanuel Revici, as well as other persons concerned in the matter.\"119 Here's an entry about a memorandum from Dr. B. Aubrey Schneider of the American Cancer Society, who had heard Goldman's paper, to Dr. Charles Cameron, scientific director of the national American Cancer Society: \"In his memorandum to Dr. Cameron, Dr. Schneider adds that in a private conversation with Dr. George Cooper, Director of the Virginia Division of the Society, he indicated that he was going to try out the Lipid therapy on some cases now under his care at the University of Virginia Hospital. A copy of Dr. Goldman's paper is in the files.\" Goldman had reported on the palliative effects of Revici's therapy. He next proposed a trial of its therapeutic effects, requesting approval from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Queens General Hospital, where he served as a resident. Another entry from the American Cancer Society dossier on Revici picked up the story: \"Early in January, Dr. Cameron received a phone call from Dr. Alfred Angrist, Pathologist at Queens General Hospital. Dr. Cameron prepared a memorandum which is in the files. Dr. Angrist felt that Dr. Revici exerted strong psychotherapeutic influences on patients and discussed his personal feelings, as Chairman of the Hospital Committee on Research and Publications, with regard to hospital approval of a paper on the Revici treatment by Dr. Goldman. Because of Dr. Angrist's strong 'anti' feelings, an ad hoc committee had been appointed to consider the particular paper, and Dr. Angrist felt that the committee's membership had been stacked. At his request, Dr. Cameron suggested Drs. Gellhorn, Bodansky, and Schoenbach as additional committee members.\"120 Minutes from meetings of the Institute of Applied Biology's board of directors in 1952 relate that the \"restacked\" IRB at Queens General denied Goldman approval. In 1986, Dr. Goldman addressed the Regents of the State of New York, in a written plea supporting Revici's struggle with the Office of Professional Medical Conduct to remain in practice. He noted his early interest in Revici's treatment, and\u2014for the first time publicly - he disclosed that his studies on lipid therapy had cost him his residency privileges. While the American Cancer Society and associated elements in mainstream medicine were helping to clip Dr. Goldman's wings behind the scenes, The New York Times printed a feature on the Institute of Applied Biology in its December 2, 1952 issue.121 The writer, William L. Laurence, was probably the most distinguished science reporter at that time; the US had broken the news of the A-bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki under his byline. The first three paragraphs of Laurence's report on the Institute of Applied Biology ran as follows: Animal experiments and tests on patients in advanced stages of cancer were described last night by leaders in medicine as lending \"strong support\" to a new concept of malignant disease that may lead to a radically new approach to its ultimate control. The progress reports on the new methods, developed at the Institute of Applied Biology, Brooklyn, were presented at the fifth annual dinner of the Cancer Research and Hospital Foundation at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. More than 400 leaders in medicine and other professions, as well as leaders in industry and civic affairs, were present. One of the reports was prepared by Dr. John Masterson of Brooklyn, former president of the Medical Society of the State of New York and a member of the House of Delegates of the American Medical Association. He is now attending the American Medical Association meeting at Denver and the report was read in his absence. Other reports were presented by Dr. John M. Galbraith, past president of the Nassau County Medical Society; Dr. Emanuel Revici, scientific director of the Institute; and Dr. Robert Ravich, assistant director. Laurence's last paragraph, notes: \"Prof. Jacques Maritain of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton, NJ, one of the world's leading philosophers, is a director of the Cancer Research and Hospital Foundation, a non-profit organization to raise funds for the cancer research program of the Brooklyn Institution.\"122 By the mid-1950s, at least one of Revici's associates believed a distinct pattern had become discernible in the reception of papers submitted to peer-reviewed journals by the Institute of Applied Biology. In a letter to one of the Institute's chief funders, dated 11/12/55, Robert Ravich recounted the publication history of an article he had co-authored with Revici, titled, \"Antihemorrhagic Action of n-Butanol in Advanced Cancer\" (Angiology, December 6, 1953). Bear in mind that butanol - the higher sterol Revici gave to control bleeding in Resistance fighters in southern France - worked so well, it set the Nazis on its developer's trail; in effect, it amounted to his \"ticket\" out of Europe. 123 In the United States after the war, Revici had developed butanol for cancer patients too ill to stem internal hemorrhages surgically. Injected intravenously, it sped through the blood system to the site of a severed artery or vein, permanently constricting the muscle tissue circling the vessel at the rupture point. The Revici-Ravich paper reported on two small series of patients, one group injected with butanol and the other, control arm, not given Revici's antihemorrhagic agent. (Revici discovered the mechanism of action after publication.) Ravich's letter started with an assertion: \"I told you that the Institute of Applied Biology had encountered a mysterious form of censorship whenever it attempted to have an article concerning cancer published in the regular channels. The following is a case history which bears out my statement.\" In short, Ravich's case history of the butanol paper goes like this: rejection in 1951 by Cancer (after a recommendation to accept by the reviewer); rejection in 1951 by the Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine and the Journal of the National Cancer Institute; and rejections in 1953 in the original submission and resubmission to the New York State Journal of Medicine. The editors cited various reasons. Consultants didn't think the paper represented a controlled clinical experiment (Cancer). The subject was not of sufficient interest to readers (Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine). Not suitable for publication here: try a journal of a more general nature (Journal of the American Cancer Institute). It was doubtful that n-Butanol had any relation to the cessation of hemorrhage in the patients studied (New York State Journal of Medicine). Dr. Ravich closed his letter with these paragraphs: On August 12, 1953, the article was submitted to Angiology. It was accepted without comment and was published on December 6, 1953. Angiology is a journal with very limited circulation, and not one that is likely to be read by doctors interested in cancer or by general practitioners who might find the article of value. We have received requests for reprints from all over the country and the world and some interesting comments and observations. The experience with this paper indicates beyond any question that the problem of publishing our work on cancer is not a simple one. Why this invisible form of censorship is permitted to exist in scientific and medical publications and how it operates are questions that I am not able to answer. But I do believe we are justified in saying, on the basis of such experiences, that the normal channels of publication have been closed to us and that we are therefore forced to take any other way that may be open, to get our findings before the medical and scientific public. Then Ravich added a postscript, dredging up a wider, deeper history of attempts by Revici and the Institute of Applied Biology to publish in the peer-reviewed literature: Every paper we have submitted on subjects outside the field of cancer has been accepted; every one concerned with cancer has been rejected. When four articles were submitted by Dr. Revici by title alone, for presentation at the International Cancer Congress in Paris in 1950, all of them were rejected. Only seven papers in all were rejected, and almost a thousand read. I learned from Dr. Oberling that they had been rejected because of the intervention of Dr. Rhoades and others in this country on the program committee. He would have known the circumstances behind the rejection of Revici's papers Dr. Charles Oberling (1895-1960) Why was he so respected? Dr. Charles Oberling (Metz, July 31 1895- Paris, March 11, 1960) 124, a French academic physician who relocated in the US after World War II, was highly regarded by American oncologists. Son of a railway employee, Charles Oberling was born on July 31, 1895, in Metz, a bustling garrison town in Alsace-Lorraine1. Despite his numerous trips to the United States, Iran, Germany and France, he remained, throughout his life, attached to his native city, \"a strong city par excellence\" 2. Schooled in Alsace-Lorraine, he naturally did all his studies in German. In 1913, he continued to study medicine in Strasbourg, obtaining his doctorate in medicine in 1919. Dr. Charles Oberling Having opted for French nationality, Oberling was admitted as an intern at the University of Strasbourg and became assistant to Professor Pierre Masson. He worked at the Institute of Pathological Anatomy until 1926. In 1928, Charles Oberling obtained a chair in Histology, Embryology and Pathological Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris. He focuses his research on tumors of the nervous system and meninges. Back in Strasbourg in 1936, he headed the Institute of Bacteriology. During the Second World War, the University of Strasbourg was relocated. At the end of 1939, on a proposal from the French authorities, Charles Oberling became hygiene advisor to the Iranian government. Elected dean of the Tehran Faculty of Medicine soon after, he reorganized the university and studies. From 1942 to 1944 he worked as a pathologist at Cooperstown Hospital in the United States, publishing The Riddle of Cancer, then returned to Tehran. In 1948, Professor Oberling returned to France to head a cancer research institute for the CNRS. He obtained a chair in oncology at the Faculty of Paris in 1949, then a chair in experimental medicine at the Coll\u00e8ge de France. He was elected member of the section of biological sciences of the National Academy of Medicine..125 Professor Charles Oberling, the famous French pathologist, was the pioneer in designing a new educational curriculum based on the modern programs in Iran. He was introduced by French officials to reorganize the Faculty of Medicine of Tehran University. In 1939, Oberling came to Iran and was appointed as the dean of the Faculty of medicine. With the support of Iranian officials and his colleagues at medical school, he designed a new educational curriculum based on the modern programs, similar to those in medical schools of Europe, especially France. He also equipped and redesigned Tehran hospitals for educational purposes and had them supervised by medical school authorities. The other main goal of Professor Oberling in Iran was improvement of health standards by controlling the diseases and providing proper facilities for implementation of hygiene. Professor Charles Oberling passed away in 1960 at the age of 65. He was vanquished by cancer, the enemy he had always fought. On his death, his colleague wrote: \"Oberling was both a man of action and a humanist...he loved life...his warmth and enthusiasm won him a myriad of admires\". 126 Le syst\u00e8me r\u00e9ticulo-endoth\u00e9lial, Paris: Paris: Masson, 1933-1934.

Gaston Doin & cie, fibro-ad\u00e9nomes Oberling / 2e \u00e9dition / Paris : Masson et Cie, 1942.128 So Oberling is well respected among oncologists, while he had no solution for cancer and died of it 64, and Revici was ignored, while he cured cancer and, in spite of all the sabotage he received, lived to be 101. If you think that's odd, listen to what kind of person the first Sloan Kettering director was, \"Dr\"Cornelius Rhoades: Dr Cornelius Rhoads, headed the chemical warfare devision of OSS (precurser to CIA), established the U.S. Army chemical weaponslaboratories and maker of chemotherapy drug based on mustard gas that is still used today, as well as first director of Cancer Research Institute Sloan Kettering from 1945 to 1960 Guilty of unethical human experimentation, called patients \"lab animals\"\"that he and the other doctors had fun torturing\" injecting them with cancer cells. Dr. Cornelius Rhoads, the first major postwar director of Memorial Hospital in New York City (later, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center), had headed the Chemical Warfare division of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the predecessor of the CIA. Rhoads had used his wartime post to experiment with mustard gas - a chemical agent used in World War I - on human cancer. The Congress to which Ravich referred was the International Union Against Cancer, whose president and editor on different occasions was Prof. Joseph Maisin of Belgium. Beginning in 1940, he served as director of Memorial Hospital for Cancer Research in New York, from 1945 was the first director of Sloan-Kettering Institute, and the first director of the combined Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. In early 1932, a letter Rhoads had written in November 1931, which disparaged Puerto Ricans and makes claims (which he referred to later as jokes) he had intentionally injected cancer cells into his patients, was given by a lab assistant to Puerto Rican nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. This is what Rhoads wrote in his horrible, racist, genocidal, psychotic letter: \" I can get a d*** fine job here and am tempted to take it. It would be ideal except for the Porto Ricans. They are beyond doubt the dirtiest, laziest, most degenerate and thievish race of men ever inhabiting this sphere. It makes you sick to inhabit the same island with them. They are even lower than Italians. What the island needs is not public health work but a tidal wave or something to totally exterminate the population. It might then be livable. I have done my best to further the process of extermination by killing off 8 and transplanting cancer into several more. The latter has not resulted in any fatalities so far... The matter of consideration for the patients' welfare plays no role here \u2014 in fact all physicians take delight in the abuse and torture of the unfortunate subjects. \"131 Pedro Albizu Campos.publicized the letter in the Puerto Rican and American media, which led to a scandal, an official investigation, and a US whitewashing campaign to protect Rhoads and, by extension, Rockefeller interests. In the ensuing investigation, Rhoads defended himself, saying he had written his comments in anger and as a joke to a New York colleague. Rhoads taught as a pathologist at Harvard and conducted research on disease processes. In 1929, Rhoads joined the staff of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, now Rockefeller University, where he worked for Simon Flexner. He was also staff pathologist at Rockefeller Hospital. Rhoads was to assist Castle, and they established a base in San Juan at the Presbyterian Hospital. Rhoads corresponded often with Simon Flexner at the Rockefeller Institute in New York regarding his research and career interests. In Puerto Rico, the Rockefeller group had more than 200 patients; historian and ethicist Susan E. Lederer notes that, while referred to as patients, they were primarily clinical subjects whose conditions were studied to advance medical research. Because of the effects of anemia and the suspicion that tropical sprue was related to diet, Rhoads experimentally controlled patients' diets. Lederer notes that in letters from this time, Rhoads referred to his patients as \"experimental 'animals'.\" He wrote: \"If they don't develop something they certainly have the constitutions of oxen.\" Rhoads sought to experimentally induce the conditions he was studying in his patients rather than simply treat them. If they did develop tropical sprue, he could treat it with liver extract. Mustard gas or sulfur mustard is a chemical compound belonging to the sulfur-based family of cytotoxic and blister agent chemical warfare agents known as sulfur-mustards or mustard agents. ... Mustard gas can form large blisters on exposed skin and in the lungs, often resulting in prolonged illness ending in death. 133 For the rest of his life, his research interest was in developing chemotherapy for cancer treatment, but he served primarily as an administrator and scientific director at Memorial and Sloan-Kettering. From studies of mustard gas, he developed a drug called mechlorethamine or Mustargen. Its success in clinical trials during the war years was the basis for the development of the field of anti-cancer chemotherapy. Rhoads also became interested in total body irradiation, which led to early work on chemotherapy.134 Mechlorethamine is a nitrogen mustard and antineoplastic agent that has been in clinical use for more than 60 years, given systemically in combination with other antineoplastic agents to treat Hodgkin disease, chronic leukemias, lung cancer and polycythemia vera135 Rhoads is the first director of Sloan Kettering Institute, 1945-1953, scientific director until 1960 In 1945, the Sloan-Kettering Institute was founded as a cancer research center, claiming to hope that an industrial approach to research would yield a cure. It opened in 1948. While still director of Memorial, from 1945 until 1953 Rhoads also served as the first director of the Sloan-Kettering Institute. He was \"praised by Memorial for his 'essential role in the evolution of the hospital into a modern medical center.'\"136 As director of Sloan-Kettering, he had oversight as well over research related to Department of Defense radiation experiments through 1954. For instance, that year, a Sloan-Kettering team began a multi-year study of \"Post-Irradiation Syndrome in Humans.\"137 Influence of Revici's Institute of Applied Biology Through the 1950s and early 1960s, research papers from the Institute of Applied Biology papers slipped into medical journals,20 and The New York Times covered a few of the Institute of Applied Biology's research advances, in areas where the papers or research didn't concern Revici's theories and therapeutic applications in cancer.21 From time to time, research on lipids and cancer not originating at the Institute of Applied Biology appeared in the scientific literature, focused on abnormal lipid metabolism, a prime Revici area of study.22 Modern molecular biologists began publishing their insights into lipids in the 1980s, and virtually no clues in the English-language scientific literature pointed toward Revici as their predecessor. Bengt Samuelsson's research on leukotrienes, which earned him a Nobel Prize in 1982, exemplifies independent confirmation of Revici's groundbreaking experiments. Samuelsson published his observations almost a generation after Revici had described these fatty acids in a paper read by a colleague at an international radiology conference in London in 1950.140 By the 1980s, Revici had been a US resident (and naturalized citizen) for close to four decades, treating cancer patients at his New York City Institute of Applied Biology (IAB) since 1947 with compounds derived from his clinical research. These agents, negligible in toxicity, included selenium in lipid bases and Omega-3-ALAand Omega-6-LA. Unlike his scientific investigations, Revici's medical applications quickly attracted the attention of establishment institutions, the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Cancer Society (ACS) foremost among them. False Attacks on Revici The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published a joint letter in August 1945, warning about the treatment for cancer at the clinic that Revici had established in Mexico City in 1942. The signers were US physicians who had visited the clinic between the fall of 1943 and the summer of 1945. The Journal of the American Medical Association published a report by the American Medical Association Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry in 1949, which associated Revici's method of cancer management with quackery and denigrated the research at the Institute of Applied Biology. In 1949, the Institute of Applied Biology was located in Brooklyn, and the Brooklyn Cancer Committee of the American Cancer Society reprinted and distributed the American Medical Association report. Revici and the Institute of Applied Biology sued the Brooklyn Cancer Committee for libel. The facts relating to the 1949Journal of the American Medical Association report slandering Revici and the Institute of Applied Biology and the consequent Institute of Applied Biology suit are provided in the account here. Note that, since the 1940s, the American Cancer Society has been the prime source for stories spread among the medical profession about Revici. The media, for the most part, has echoed the Society in reporting about him to the public\u2014as they have done in general with unorthodox approaches to care branded heretical, in effect, by the American Cancer Society. The most elaborate American Cancer Society version of Revici's career appeared in the March/April 1989 issue of CA - A Cancer Journal For Clinicians, an American Cancer Society publication. It spoke matter-of-factly of evaluations of his cancer therapy by US physicians in the mid-1940s. As this part of the Revici appreciation will show, all the tests of Revici's therapy which the American Cancer Society represented in this piece as actually occurring in the 1940s turned out to be hearsay, misunderstandings of situations, or opinions expressed in correspondence.141 Close to 800 pages in print, Revici's monograph summed up his prolific findings from the mid-1920s through the 1950s. When it undertook to bring out Revici's monograph, D. Van Nostrand had been publishing scientific volumes from its main office in Princeton, NJ, since 1848. It had earned a solid reputation for quality. A letter from the president, Edward M. Crane, on June 8, 1961, spoke of the publishing firm's \"keen interest\" in an \"important and valuable book.\"23 Earlier that spring, in the March-April issue, Ca, a Journal for Clinicians had come out with a feature on Revici's method of cancer control, characterizing it as \"unproven.\" Crane, D. Van Nostrand's president, in a telephone interview in the late 1980s (conducted by the writer), said he thought there was room at that time for another approach to cancer. Revici had filled his book with explanations of his theories, with reports of experiments on their clinical application, as leads to follow and independently prove or disprove the efficacy of his therapy. He viewed his method as a way to manage cancer that differed in critical particulars from standard therapy: his treatments were comparatively non-invasive, negligible in toxicity, and individually guided. He also felt that the results of his treatment were equal or superior to the outcomes of treatments in common practice in a significant percentage of cases, especially in cases resistant to other approaches. In blacklisting Revici's method of cancer control, the American Cancer Society aimed to keep patients from his therapy. To an incalculable extent, the Society succeeded. There's no telling how many of Revici's medical insights might have proven of value, had clinicians been able to get hold of his text, to familiarize themselves with his method, to test his treatments in practice. Most importantly, had the American Cancer Society not discouraged sales of his book, there's no estimating the number of patients who might have benefited from the free circulation of his ideas. Revici's publications in the 70' s This publication was also to prove the near terminal event in his attempts to acquaint his peers with his clinical research: one paper on the narcotic addiction treatment Revici developed in the early 1970s appeared by invitation in a Canadian government journal on addictions in Quebec in 1973. More False Attacks on Revici The 1989 American Cancer Society piece also claimed that Revici demonstrated his method at the University of Chicago in 1946, trying it on 52 cancer patients with \"no favorable effects\" attributable to his treatment. The Society's source was an American Medical Association file. Who supplied this story to the American Medical Association awaits an airing of American Medical Association informants on Revici. Indisputably, Revici was in Chicago in 1946\u2014thanks to Gustave Freeman, an assistant professor of Medicine at the University of Chicago. Gustave Freeman, an assistant professor of Medicine at the University of Chicago. Freeman had stumbled onto Revici in 1944 while serving as a major in the US Army in Mexico, where his duties involved official liaison with the Mexican government and research on controlling typhus. A lieutenant undergoing treatment at the Mexico City clinic had aroused his curiosity. Six times over two months, without prior notice, Freeman dropped into the clinic, speaking with Revici for many hours. (His fluency in Spanish gave him an edge over other US physicians appraising Revici's research.) On February 12, 1945, Freeman reported to Dr. George Dick, chief of the Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, that Revici seemed \"properly scientific in his outlook.\" None of the American physicians investigating his clinic had discovered any unethical activities, including a San Antonio surgeon, Dudley Jackson, who had exposed cancer quacks for the US Public Health Service and was sending patients to the Mexican clinic. Remarking that Revici's approach was \"so much more promising than anything that has appeared in the field of cancer,\" Freeman urged Dr. Dick to offer adequate lab facilities and patients for a fair trial. Revici shuttered his Mexican institute, arranging for patients under treatment to continue, and drove by car with his family to Chicago.10 Visas ordered by a special wartime assistant to President Franklin Roosevelt, Sumner Welles, eased his entry into the US. (The visas, requested by commanders of the Resistance, recognized both Revici's service with the French Underground and his promising cancer research.) Jackson had been asked by Chauncey Leake to sign the 1945 Journal of the American Medical Association letter. Instrumental in founding the National Cancer Institute in 1937. Dr. Dudley Jackson had the political muscle to refuse. A Loyal Friend of Revici's: Dudley Jackson, Sr., 1890-1959 Dudley Jackson, Sr., cancer researcher and oncologist, was born in Eddy, Texas, on August 26, 1890, the son of Charles S. and Sallie (Wright) Jackson. He received his early education in Brownwood public schools and attended Daniel Baker College before graduating from the University of Texas Medical Branch in 1917. Jackson served an internship as a first lieutenant in the United States Army and was stationed both in the United States and overseas. After his discharge in 1919 he opened a medical practice in San Antonio, specializing in cancer, and remained there until his death. With the help of legislation introduced by his cousin, Representative Maury Maverick, Sr., Jackson was instrumental in founding the National Institute of Cancer. Jackson was a member of the Bexar County Medical Society, of which he was president in 1932. He was also a member of the American Medical Association, Texas Medical Association, Texas Surgical Society, Southern Medical Association, and American Academy-International of Medicine. He was a fellow of the American College of Surgeons and International College of Surgeons. In 1954 he received the medal of the American Cancer Society and a certificate of merit from the society's Texas division. He was also the holder of a Walter Reed Society award for experiments in cancer, in which he transplanted living cancer cells into his own body in order to disprove the theory that cancer is contagious. Noted for his willingness to treat cancer patients regardless of their race or their ability to pay, Jackson helped organize the Pan American Cancer Foundation, a group dedicated to the care of cancer patients in the southwestern United States and Mexico who could not afford treatment. Jackson married Dr. Martha Nell Beal of Bertram on October 5, 1919, in Beaumont. They had two children. He died of acute coronary occlusion on July 25, 1959. 143 Leake married the microbiologist Elisabeth Wilson in 1921, and they collaborated for many years. They had two sons and remained married until her death in 1977. Leake discovered the anesthetic divinyl ether. One of his publications was a translation of the 1628 physiological work De motu cordis (On the Motion of the Heart) from Latin to English. Leake became a fulltime university administrator from 1942, first at the University of Texas and from 1962 at Ohio State University. Confirming Revici's suspicion that Leake had authored the Journal of the American Medical Association warning, Jackson added an intriguing bit of information. Leake, he said, had been inspired by Cornelius Rhoads, head of the chemical warfare division of the Office of Strategic Services during World War II. Postwar director of Memorial Hospital in New York City, Rhoads had used his military position to test deadly chemical agents as chemotherapy for cancer. Shortly after Revici's arrival in Chicago, Dr. Dick's term as dean expired. The new dean, unsympathetic to Revici, forbade him to treat patients at the university hospital. Shelved in Chicago, Revici interviewed several doctors in the eastern US interested in cancer, choosing Abraham Ravich, a urologist with a large practice in Brooklyn, New York. Revici's co worker Abraham Ravich (1899) Abraham Ravich, (Slonim, Poland.June 10, 1899) the Doctor Emanuel Revici chose to work with,was a Polish, American urologist. He was the first to report on transmissible virus in prostate, cervix and bladder cancer asvenereal infection, and circumcision of new born males to prevent such cancers, also on significant role of renal vein compression by intra-renal pelvis in production of essential hypertension. Named honorary surgeon Honor Legion New York City Police Department.146 Abraham Ravich147 quickly convinced prominent local physicians, businessmen, educators, judges, and attorneys to back Revici's research. In March 1947, this group chartered two non-profit organizations; the Institute of Applied Biology (IAB), and the Cancer Research and Hospital Foundation. Dr. Ravich was named director of the Institute of Applied Biology; Revici was named the scientific director (a position he held until 1990). Dr. Gustave Freeman resigned from Chicago University and moved to Brooklyn to work alongside Revici. Abraham Ravich's son Robert, fresh out of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, also threw in his lot with Revici .148 The only open access article I could find on Gustave Freeman was this obituary150: In April 1947, Gustave Freeman sent a detailed letter to an associate editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association, providing information on Revici and the nature of the Institute of Applied Biology's clinical research. Most likely, Freeman was responding to an American Medical Association request for background on Revici, because his letter touched on the story about Revici testing his method in Chicago. Freeman told the editor that conditions and facilities didn't permit Revici to treat any patients at the University of Chicago hospital. Through the Freedom of Information Act, Marcus A. Cohen from the Townsend Letter151 obtained an FBI dossier on Revici in the late 1980s. Consisting of investigative and surveillance reports dating between the late 1950s and mid-1960s, it indicated that the FBI had cleared Revici, but most pages were unreadable, blacked out with \"Top Secret\" stamped at the top. A deep wartime friendship between Revici and Constantin Omansky, Soviet Ambassador to Mexico, may have sparked the Bureau's concern, putting agents on his postwar trail to snoop for residual ties with the Communist bloc in Eastern Europe. On several pages, one can make out that an agent checked Revici's medical activities in Chicago, finding no trace of him in the university hospital records. Four years after the 1945 warning about Revici's treatment in the Journal of the American Medical Association, bad publicity lingered as a major \"stumbling block\" to fundraising. But the \"highly ethical conduct of the research and the favorable results obtained\" in terminal cancer cases at the Institute of Applied Biology were gradually dispersing the murky cloud over Revici created by that public statement. Then, on January 8, 1949, the Journal of the American Medical Association ran a report by the American Medical Association Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, headed \"Cancer and the Need for Facts.\" The report named various individuals and groups as charlatans and purveyors of quackery, Revici and the Institute of Applied Biology among them. The sole basis for including Revici appeared to be the 1945Journal of the American Medical Association's warning. A number of organizations widely propagated the American Medical Association report, the American Cancer Society and the Consumers' Union in the lead. The report blasted the Institute of Applied Biology's hopes of getting grants from the National Cancer Institute. The president of the local American Cancer Society chapter, the Brooklyn Cancer Committee (BCC), reprinted the section on Revici and distributed the excerpt. Subsequently, the Visiting Nurse Association refused to service Institute of Applied Biology ambulatory cases, and the county medical society barred the Institute of Applied Biology from using the society's auditorium to defend its research before the medical profession. Of course, lay members of the Institute of Applied Biology experienced extreme difficulty in collecting funds to support lab and clinical programs. To protect their reputations, the lay sponsors of the Institute of Applied Biology demanded legal action, first against the local arm of the American Cancer Society, next against the American Medical Association . A suit for libel was soon filed against the Brooklyn Cancer Committee and its president. A libel suit against the American Medical Association, the laymen decided, would be too costly and difficult, so they abandoned the idea. The suit against the Brooklyn Cancer Committee never proceeded to trial. Dr. John Masterson, president of the Medical Society of the State of New York, intervened, called the parties to a conference over which he presided, and issued a statement agreed to by all parties. The Brooklyn Cancer Committee declared it never authorized or knew in advance about the reprint and its distribution, disavowed the letter by its president accompanying the reprint, and disavowed any slanderous inferences in the reprint and letter. The Brooklyn Cancer Committee president acknowledged that he had acted on his own, regretted his action, and also disavowed the contents of the reprint, his letter, and libelous inferences in both. All parties agreed that the section on Revici and the Institute of Applied Biology in the American Medical Association report was unjustified. Revici and the I Institute of Applied Biology withdrew their suit. In the near aftermath, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a letter from Dr. Abraham Ravich, Institute of Applied Biology director, in its July 9, 1949 issue. The letter began: \"An article entitled 'Cancer and the Need for Facts' that appeared in The Journal (January 8, p. 93) contained a number of unwarranted statements derogatory to the research of Dr. Emanuel Revici and the Institute of Applied Biology. These statements were based on a correspondence item published in The Journal on Aug. 18, 1945 (p. 1186). We have in our possession and submit conclusive documentary evidence from a majority of these signers that completely contradicts their published unfavorable correspondence. Accordingly, the statements that appeared in The Journal were without justification if based on these alleged facts.\"152 Neither the American Medical Association nor the American Cancer Society has ever coupled the 1945 letter warning against Revici's Mexican clinic or the 1949 report by the American Medical Association Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry with this Institute of Applied Biology letter in their presentations questioning the efficacy of Revici's therapeutic method. Nor have the American Medical Association and American Cancer Society ever referred to the out-of-court settlement of the suit against the Brooklyn Cancer Committee that vindicated Revici and the Institute of Applied Biology. There was another development in the aftermath of the suit against the Brooklyn Cancer Committee, which neither the American Medical Association nor the American Cancer Society has ever disclosed: impressed by the treatment approach and results at the Institute of Applied Biology, Dr. John Masterson became a member of the Institute of Applied Biology's board of directors.153 Dr. Revici remained embattled with the New York State health authorities for years and his medical license was revoked in 1993 at the age of 96. 154 Revici's Legal battles The last two decades of his life enmeshed Revici in desperate battles to remain in practice. He had survived the Clinical Appraisal Group's evaluation in 1965, suffering a drastic blow to his reputation. In the early 1970s, he had survived temporary suspension from the Medicaid program and a threat by the New York City health commissioner to prosecute him for administering allegedly unapproved compounds to detoxify some 3,000 drugs addicts.155 Then, in November 1983 and again in January 1984, the deadliest attacks ever mounted against him commenced in the federal court and before the Office of Professional Medical Conduct.156 In the court, he faced two malpractice suits, the first major negligence actions against him in 63 years of continuous practice. He faced charges of gross negligence and gross incompetence (to cite the gravest of the charges, which basically reduce to departures from community standards resulting in claims of injury to patients \u2014 the simple definition of medical malpractice in negligence law). Each proceeding could oust him from practice and close the Institute of Applied Biology. Fourteen years of keeping, losing, and regaining his license in the State proceedings passed with an instrumental role played by his patients in saving the license. Many victories were won by Revici in court. The cases went to trial before juries, and in both cases the juries returned verdicts against him and awarded damages in monetary amounts totally beyond his capability to pay. His attorneys filed appeals with the appellate court, and the appellate opinions reversed the lower court verdicts, remanding both cases for retrial.157 The second case proceeded to retrial, and the jury verdict this time was for Revici.158 The reason for reversal in each case was the same. The appellate justices ruled that the lower court judges had failed to instruct the juries to consider whether the patients had expressly assumed the risk of treatment that departed from community standards. The appellate rulings set a legal precedent, \"Express Assumption of Risk\" (technically speaking, an affirmative defense). Under this precedent, if a defendant physician proves to a jury that a patient expressly assumed the risk of unconventional care, this bars recovery of any damages. To quote the appellate opinion in the first case: 'Appellees contend that it is against public policy for one expressly to assume the risk of medical malpractice and thereby dissolve the physician's duty to treat a patient according to community standards. We first note that the 'public policy' referred to ... is defined solely by statute ... and appellant points to no statute imposing limitations upon such express agreements. Moreover, we see no reason why a patient should not be allowed to make an informed decision to go outside currently approved medical methods in search of an unconventional treatment While a patient should be encouraged to exercise care for his own safety, we believe that an informed decision to avoid surgery and conventional therapy is within the patient's' right to determine what shall be done with his own body* 159. The two sentences that end this quote firmly place a significant development in the judicial branch of government, a matter of relatively narrow interest, into a much more general trend toward liberalization of attitudes about the risks patients (and the public) may take in choices affecting health. This trend is discernible in actions and policies of the legislative and executive branches of government160 It is traceable in medicine, where mainly the patient-centered school of outcomes research supplies impetus 161, and where increasing use of modem electronic communications devices tends to foster it (Silberg, et a], 1997). The trend has been growing noticeable in these areas at different rates of progression, but its affect in common has been to expand the therapeutic options available to patients, especially for alternatives to mainstream care. Revici's malpractice cases make a signal, historically secure contribution to this trend. Reflecting on his life, on the obstacles he encountered in advancing his career and striving to earn recognition as a seminal figure in 20th-century medical science, certain questions arise about his temperament, about the ways he conducted research and applied laboratory findings to clinical practice. In short, how much did the personal factor count in building resistance to his theories and method of treatment? In precipitating the trials that buffeted him mercilessy toward the end of his days? His approach to research was traditional: observation first, next hypothesis, then experiment. Theory seems to have appealed to him more than experimentation did. (He repeated experiments to confirm his hypotheses and data, but as soon as his experiments convinced him that he was correct, he wasted no time repeating them again.) Still, he clearly realized that both weighed equally in discovering and perfecting treatment.162 Temperamentally, though, Revici had little tolerance for the time generally required to bring new treatments from breakthroughs in the laboratory to approval by the Food and Drug Administration. He felt very strongly that gravely ill patients whose conditions were resistant to accepted modes of therapy could not wait for the approval process to run its usual dilatory course. Once his own careful experiments confirmed to him that a therapeutic agent he developed was safe and effective, he gave it to patients regardless of regulatory agency policy. Recovery, or relief for his patients was his primary, overriding rule. The medical community and regulatory agencies, of course, adhere to a different, opposing rule, so his stubborn insistence in guiding his clinical practice in accord with his rule was likely to engender suspicion, hostility, and eventually administrative investigation and civil prosecution. Independent validations of Revici's findings about lipid structure and function have begun to accumulate over the past 20 years. The section on his scientific discoveries in this article singles him out as the first medical scientist to elucidate the bioactivity of leukotrienes, the first to develop a safe, effective means of lipid transport. Certainly, he pioneered in the use of selenium in a virtually non-toxic form to treat cancer163 It now also appears that he predated his peers in administering Omega-3-ALAto shrink tumors.164 When the Office of Professional Medical Conduct succeeded in revoking his license, on charges of probation violation amounting to inadequate record keeping (New York. State Health Department, 1993), they severed the ties to treatment and patients that had challenged him intellectually and nourished him emotionally throughout his career. Dr. Korin took over until he passed away. It was run for a while by Dr. Joseph Carozzi and is now run by Dr. Revici's grandson. They use fatty acids and sterols, enzymes, high-dose selenium, dietary changes, and a \"biologically guided\" nontoxic chemotherapy. He recommends not taking high dose vitamins without checking how these shift the body's acid/alkaline balance. 165 Late in life, reflecting on his Parisian period, he confided to friends that he never would have left France were it not for World War II.166 I think he also would probably have been better off if he had stayed in Mexico. 220.

Chem. Soc., Sept., 1959. Emanuel Revici, MD was a Romanian-born physician who had traversed the spectrum of human health, chemistry, lipids and physiology in ways never previously seen. Having emerged during the boom of quantum physics during the early and mid-20th century, Dr. Revici's 77 years of clinical practice was inspired by Albert Einstein and quantum theory. Einstein is attributed as stating: [Revici is] \"the greatest mind I had ever met.\" Few have ever heard of Emanuel Revici, MD, yet his discoveries and theories continue to astonish those with an interest in his revolutionary concepts. Revici's work is most known for his chemistry of lipids, and the study of various elements and lipids on cell membrane activity. Many of Revici's discoveries had pre-dated medical science's recognition by as much as 100 years. Chronology September 6, 1896 Emanuel Revici is Born in Bucharest, Romania, to Tullia Revici, also a doctor, who helps people for free if they don't have enough money, but who has such a good reputation that well kown people from far and wide come to him for help. 1898 Emanuel Revici tells his father he wants to be a doctor himself and writes an anatomy. Tullia is relieved he wants to do it to help people, not for the money. -1912 E.R. Starts medica school at age 16 and specializes in bacteriology. -1914 E.R. Pulled out of sceond year of medical school to become a field doctor in what was to become World War I. He identifies and recognises the culprit of a cholera epidemic and is deeply respected. 1920 Emanuel Revici Graduates from Medical School from the University of Bucharest at the top of his class, summa cum laude. Licensed to practice medicine and surgery in Romania. and opens a medical practice, where he, like his father, treats everyone. 1920 Revici Maintains a private practice until 1936. He also conducts research in major European medical centers including the Pasteur Institute. Makes his first discoveries involving lipids and cancer. 1926 the event that changed his life and brought him on the path of lipid therapy for cancer: a pregnant women full of cancer in her abdomen was operated on. He hadn'texpected her to live long, but 2 years later she was completely healthy, and so was her child. Revici reasoned that this must have to do with the large amount of lipids in the placenta and started testing animals with them. He noticed that some lipids stop tumor growth, and others induced, and through experimentation Between 1926and 1936 Dr. Emanuel Revici developed a method for purifying motor oil that was far superior to anything available at the time. The process was especially good for the higher purification requirements necessary to produce aviation quality oil. As Dr. Salman has said with awe, \"The man knows some chemistry.\" He is offered 5 million dollars for the patent, but decides to hold on to it, and sets up a small refinary as a familt business. With the Communist takeover of Romania after World War II, Revici no longer received any income from it. The Revoil process continues to be used today\u2014to refine both aviation and automobile motor oils. Revici marries Dida and in 1929 they have a daughter, Nita. 1936 Thanks to the funds from Revoil, Revici is able to relocate to Paris. There he continues his clinical research on lipids and pathological conditions. 1937 The Pasteur Institute deposits 5 papers submitted by Revici on lipids in pathological pain and cancer in the National Academy of Science (France), giivng revici instant fame. 1938 Revici reverses the cancer of the wife of an advisor to the president of France. Revici is offered the French Legion of Honor which he declines. It is the first of two Legion of Honor Awards he declined. The second was in 1939 which he was offered because Revici had turned over to the French government the patents to a number of his inventions with the idea that they were to be used in the fight against the invading Nazis 1941: Because of the rounding up of the jews in Paris, fleeing with his wife and daughter to Nice in Vichy, France, Revici bore with him letters of recommendation written on the eve of flight in March 1941. Dr. Roger Leroux wrote: \"Dr Revici has been working in my laboratory for two years. He is carrying on a program of very interesting research of a physiopathological nature on the metabolism of lipids. He has brought to this question several new ideas of the greatest interest. It is vital that his research be continued without interruption, for the results obtained by Dr. Revici open a multiplicity of new paths to research of all kinds, particularly in the field of cancer.\" Leroux was Professor of Pathologic Anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Paris. Dr. Chifoliau extolled Revici: \"On several occasions, in cases of patients afflicted with grave surgical conditions, I requested the aid of Dr. Revici, who willingly applied to our patients the results of his laboratory research. The result obtained in most hopeless cases were always the amelioration of pain and quite often, the progressive disappearance of large tumors. Dr. Revici's research must be continued and fostered, and may change the therapy of tumors completely.\" Chifoliau was an Honored Member of the Hospitals of Paris and a Member of the Academy of Surgery of France. Fellow leaders of the Underground sped Revici and his family out of Europe in the Fall of 1941.169 1941 Revici is forced to flee to Mexico because of his medical aid to the French Resistance. 1941-1946 With his friend Gaston Merry Revici founds the first Instituto de Biologia Aplicada (IBA). As in Paris, his reputation grows and many physicians from the United States travel to the IBA to observe his work firsthand. None of the American physicians investigating his clinic had discovered any unethical activities, including a San Antonio surgeon, Dudley Jackson, who had exposed cancer quacks for the US Public Health Service and was sending patients to the Mexican clinic. He successfully treats the cancer condition of the wife of the ambassador to Mexico from the USSR, then an ally. As a result he is offered the Stalin Decoration by Molotov, along with the sum of $50,000 and the chance to have his own institute in the Crimea. Revici declines the offer. 1945 Cornelius Rhoades, OSS, f head of chemical warfar, becomes the first director of Sloan Kettering, a Cancer research centre aimed at nuclear Cancer treatments. Cornelius Rhoades develops a chemo drug based on mustard gas. OSS is the precurser to the CIA. Subversive activities against foreign powers isits specialty. 1945 One of the Doctors visiting Revici is Gustave Freeman, Laboratory Assistant to the University of Chicago school of Medicine, who is at that moment a leuitenant of the US army, stationed in Mexico. He arranges for Revici to be invited to the University of Chicago. On February 12, 1945, Freeman reported to Dr. George Dick, chief of the Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, that Revici seemed \"properly scientific in his outlook.\"Revici is invited by the chairman of the Medical Department, University of Chicago, George Dick. to forward his research. August 18, 1945 An unexpected setback to Revici's career occurs when the highly influential.the Journal of American Medicine publishes a letter undermining Revici's work in Mexico. It is signed by 50 doctors who have visited Ravici at the clinic, and who went on to steal his ideas. Leake was the author of the letter. He was an admirer of Rhoades. 1945 Revici's entry into the U.S. was facilitated by Sumner Welles, an aid to President Roosevelt, in recognition for his work with the French Resistance and the beneficial potential of his therapeutic methods. 1945 En route, Revici stopped overnight in San Antonio to pay respects to Dr. Dudley Jackson. Jackson had been asked by Chauncey Leake to sign the 1945 Journal of the American Medical Association letter. Instrumental in founding the National Cancer Institute in 1937. Dr. Dudley Jackson refused. 1945 George Dick resigns suddenly as head of the department of medicine at Chicago Univerrsity and his successoris hostile to Revici and his methods. 1945: Stranded in the US, Revici permanently settles to New York City. Passes the examination for his New York State medical license on the first attempt. 1946 Revici interviews doctors to work with, chooses Abraham Ravich In March 1947, this group chartered two non-profit organizations; the Institute of Applied Biology (IAB), and the Cancer Research and Hospital Foundation. founds the second Institute of Applied Biology in Brooklyn, New York.Turn coat Gustave Freeman joins them. In April 1947, Gustave Freeman sent a detailed letter to an associate editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association, providing information on Revici and the nature of the Institute of Applied Biology's clinical research. Most likely, Freeman was responding to an American Medical Association request for background on Revici, because his letter touched on the story about Revici testing his method in Chicago. Freeman told the editor that conditions and facilities didn't permit Revici to treat any patients at the University of Chicago hospital. Then, on January 8, 1949, the Journal of the American Medical Association ran a report by the American Medical Association Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, headed \"Cancer and the Need for Facts.\" The report named various individuals and groups as charlatans and purveyors of quackery, Revici and the Institute of Applied Biology among them. The sole basis for including Revici appeared to be the 1945 Journal of the American Medical Association's warning. Revici meets with Albert Einstein to help formulate a mathematical definition of lipids. Reads his paper on abnormal fatty acids (leukotrienes) produced by radiation at the Sixth International Congress of Radiology in London. Revici's paper predates the findings of leukotrienes by Bengt Samuelsson who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1982. Biochemist Barry Sears, Ph.D., bases much of his groundbreaking book, The Zone, on the work of Samuelsson. (Revici further discusses these \"abnormal trienically-conjugated fatty acids\" in his textbook published in 1961, and reprinted in 1997). 1952 Purchases Trafalgar Hospital in Manhattan. Revici becomes medical director and chief of oncology. Relocates the IAB to a site across the street. 1961 Revici publishes his major textbook, Research in Physiopathology As [A] Basis For Guided Chemotherapy. (D. Van Nostrand). The work details Revici's researchbased paradigm shifts, including the theory of biological dualism, the theory of hierarchic organization, and Revici's theory of evolution. After reviewing his book in depth, The Society for Promoting International Scientific Relations, whose board includes 14 Nobel Prize winners, awards Revici its annual medal. The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) publishes what is later demonstrated to be a fictitious report about Revici's methods. Among other things, the report discusses the ineffectiveness of 345 Appendix A Revici's method while treating 52 \"phantom\" patients at the University of Chicago. A written FBI report confirms that Revici never treated any patients at the University of ChicagoThe CAG report appears in JAMA claiming Revici's method has no effect. One so-called co-author physician calls the report \"a disgrace.\" Another co-author of the CAG report who was President of the Nassau County Medical Society, writes to the President of the United States in favor of Revici's method, and has his wife's cancer treated by Revici personally. The report is contradicted by 100 pages of documented evidence and the written eyewitness account of Robert Fishbein, M.D. In Rome Professor Bizru gives a lecture before the Congress of Radiology where he reports the excellent results he has achieved using the Revici method. Revici corresponds with Professor Joseph Maisin of Belgium, formerly president and editor of the International Union Against Cancer and renowned as an authority in cancer. Working with terminally-ill patients, Maisin utilizes many of Revici's methods with startling 347 Appendix A results. The correspondence ends when Maisin is killed in a car accident in 1971. Revici treats 3,000 heroin and methadone addicts with two lipidic substances, physically detoxifying the great majority in 3 to 7 days with no withdrawal symptoms. House Select Committee on Crime holds a hearing on narcotic addiction. Daniel Casriel, M.D. gives testimony on the superior results achieved in the treatment of narcotic addiction with Dr. Revici's compounds. A feature article in Barrons (9/11/72), reports on Revici's amazing addiction treatments. Revici closes Trafalgar Hospital because of financial difficulty (the hospital had been chartered as a non-profit health facility). Then, in November 1983 and again in January 1984, the deadliest attacks ever mounted against him commenced in the federal court and before the Office of Professional Medical Conduct.170 In the court, he faced two malpractice suits, the first major negligence actions against him in 63 years of continuous practice. After 63 years of devoted patient care, Revici is sued for the first time, by three patients with the same lawyer. Revici prevails in all three cases. One case, Schneider vs Revici, establishes a precedent-setting decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals sees \"no reason why a patient should not be allowed to make an informed decision to go outside currently approved medical methods in search of an unconventional treatment.\" Edoardo Pacelli, M.D. in Naples, Italy, reports his results with 372 terminal patients using the Revici Method. Compared to the results reported with standard chemotherapy, the results are nothing short of phenomenal. Revici pays a house call to a patient who is too sick to see him, climbing five flights of stairs. Revici is ninety-three. The Office of Technology Assessment, an investigative arm of Congress, issues a report on unconventional cancer treatments, including the Revici Method. Seymour Brenner, M.D., board-certified radiation oncologist, testifies as to the successful results he has seen Revici achieve with cancer patients. Revici moves his offices to mid-town Manhattan. In 1993, at age 96, Revici's medical license is revoked due to inadequate record keeping. Revici celebrates his 100th birthday. Accolades come from doctors, researchers, friends, former patients, reporters, and government leaders including Governor Pataki (NY) and President Clinton. In Zimbabwe the James Mobb Clinic reports that protocols developed by Revici are superior to treatments using protease inhibitors, enabling wheelchaired AIDS patients back to work in weeks. At the F.A.I.M. (Foundation for the Advancement of Innovative Medicine) conference in New York, Revici receives an extended standing ovation for his lifetime of extraordinary achievement.171 In 1996, at 100 years of age, Kelley Eidam writes Revici's biography. January 9, 1998 Revici dies in his home in New York, after 77 years of practice and curing thousands upon thousands of people with so called uncurable diseases. His institute is run by Dr Korin during his illnss, thenby Dr. Joseph Carozzi. and now by Dr Revici's grandson. The Revici Life Science Center Inc. 200 West 57th St, Suite 402, New York, NY 10019. Tel: 212 252-1942172 Commentary and Conclusion Revici was a hero in his home country Romania, and also France and Mexico. He was then lured to the US under false pretenses, and treated horribly culminating in his license being revoked, even though he cured thousands upon thusands of supposedly incurable diseases, and other doctors stealing his ideas and passing them off as their own. It's a heart breaking story of a doctor who only wanted to help people being vilified and sabotaged by evil people. The real attacks on his person coincide with sadistic, racist chemical warfare specialist Rhoades becoming director of Sloan ketteing. Look at the trap they ste up for Revici. Luring him to the US, arranging for the letter signed by the 50 physicians. It's almost funny if it weren't so disgusting how these criminals are so used to doing crime they make sleepy bureaucratic mistakes, like forgetting to update to the fact that he never wentto Chicago. Or did George Dick resign by surprise after which they had to improvise? Was this conspiracy against Revici perhaps too much for george Dick, and was that why he resigned suddenly, and didother criminals not get the memo, and is that why they went ion with their false allegations that Revici treated 52 patients n Chicago without effect? And then they had to think on their feet. Send Freeman to work with Revici and have him slander him. How pathetic. What would have happened if Revici were less apolitical? What if he had just accepted all those honours presidents wanted to bestow on him, accepted the money. Rise above all those vilified him. He should have gone back to France after the war. He should never have gone to theUS. The warning signs were already there. If an angel would come to earth you would expect him to be like Revici. Maybe he was one. And his license was revoked. I can't find most of his papers online, while a head of chemical warfare chemo therapy drugs based on mustard gas making racist and sadist Rhoads is honoured yearly at Sloan Kettering. The Burrs, discovered Linoleic-Acid and Alpha Linolenic Acid were essential nutrients, Emanuel Revici discovered they were cancer cures, as well as cures for many other diseases, and he explained why. Johanna Budwig cured cancer even faster than Emmanuel Revici did. We'll discuss her next. Footnotes 1Dr. Emanuel Revici MD. Explains his cancer treatment,Repeater, September 12, 2019, 9Revici's research has demonstrated that lipids have an affinity for tumors and other abnormal tissues. Because of this, the lipids or lipid-like synthetic compounds administered to the patient, either by mouth or injection, travel directly to the tumor or lesion. Cancerous tissue is abnormally rich in free lipids, and the lipidic agents introduced into the bloodstream are readily taken up by the tumor.

Emanuel Revici, MD: Efforts to Publish the Clinical Findings of a Pioneer in Lipid-Based Cancer TherapyPart 3, Townsend letter, The Examiner of Alternative Medicine, August-September 2006, ,Marcus Cohen, https://www.townsendletter.com/AugSept2006/revici30806.htm Fatty acids reside in the cell membranes. Read here how the essential fatty acids are of vital importance for the structure and oxygenation. of the cell, what the role of cholesterol is, why statins are so bad, why there is a limit on how much water you can drink and much, much more! The cell membrane is made of lipids of which Linoleic-Acid and Alpha Linolenic Acid1 are the only ones that can' t be synthesized by the body. They need to be ingested. A quarter to a third of the cell membrane is made of Essential fatty Acids, Omega 3-ALA and Omega-6-LA. While lipids are the fundamental structural elements of membranes, proteins are responsible for carrying out specific membrane functions. Most plasma membranes consist of approximately 50% lipid and 50% protein by weight, with the carbohydrate portions of glycolipids and glycoproteins constituting 5 to 10% of the membrane mass. Since proteins are much larger than lipids, this percentage corresponds to about one protein molecule per every 50 to 100 molecules of lipid. In 1972, Jonathan Singer and Garth Nicolson proposed the fluid mosaic model of membrane structure, which is now generally accepted as the basic paradigm for the organization of all biological membranes. In this model, membranes are viewed as two-dimensional fluids in which proteins are inserted into lipid bilayers 2. This is what a eukaryotic cell membrane, like we have, looks like: Functions The plasma membrane is selectively permeable i.e. it allows only selected substances to pass through. It protects the cells from shock and injuries. The fluid nature of the membrane allows the interaction of molecules within the membrane. It is also important for secretion, cell growth, and division etc. It allows transport of molecules across the membrane. This transport can be of two types: Active transport - This transport occurs against the concentration gradient and therefore, requires energy. It also needs carrier proteins and is a highly selective process. Passive transport - This transport occurs along the concentration gradient and therefore, does not require energy. Thus, it does not need carrier proteins and is not selective3. Membrane Fluidity: The plasma membrane is a fluid combination of phospholipids, cholesterol, and proteins. Carbohydrates attached to lipids (glycolipids) and to proteins (glycoproteins) extend from the outward-facing surface of the membrane4. Carbohydrates attached to lipids (glycolipids) and to proteins (glycoproteins) extend from the outward-facing surface of the membrane5. A Eukaryotic cell is any cell or organism that possesses a clearly defined nucleus. Prokaryotes are organisms whose cells lack a nucleus and other organelles. Prokaryotes are divided into two distinct groups: the bacteria and the archaea, which scientists believe have unique evolutionary lineages. Most prokaryotes are small, single-celled organisms that have a relatively simple structure. 6 The eukaryotic cell has a nuclear membrane that surrounds the nucleus, in which the well-defined chromosomes (bodies containing the hereditary material) are located.7 Examples of organisims consistiing of eukaryotic cells are plants, animals, protists, fungi. Their genetic material is organized in chromosomes. 8All eukaryotic cell membranes consist of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, also those of plants! 9 Fatty acids are organic substances the molecules of which consist of a hydrophylic carboxyl head (a carbon chain, and a hydrophobic methyl tail. Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) are fatty acids whose aliphatic carbon chains are fully saturated with hydrogen atoms or contain only C-C single bond and contain no C=C double bonds. An aliphatic compound is an organic compound containing carbon and hydrogen joined together in straight chains, branched chains, or non-aromatic rings. It is one of two broad classes of hydrocarbons, the other being aromatic compounds. 10 Aromatic compounds, are unsaturated chemical compounds characterized by one or more planar rings of atoms joined by covalent bonds of two different kinds. The unique stability of these compounds is referred to as aromaticity. 11A molecule is aromatic when it adheres to 4 main criteria: The molecule must be planar, meaning two dimensional.12 The molecule must be cyclic, or round. Every atom in the aromatic ring must have a p orbital, which means that the elektrons have a dumbell shaped orbit.13 That looks like this.14 The ring must contain pi electrons.15 A pi elektron is an electron which resides in the pi bond(s) of a double bond or a triple bond, or in a conjugated p orbital. 16 Pi bonds are when the lobe of one atomic orbital overlaps another. 17Orbital lobe (lobe): A section of orbital bordered by one or more orbital nodes.18 A node is a place where there is zero probability of finding an electron. 19 The word aliphatic comes from the ancient Greek word , pronounced aleiphar, and which means \"oil or ointment\". 20 UFAs are classified C=C double bond. PUFAs, or polyunsaturated fatty acids, contain more than one C=C double bond. Because of the presence of C-C single bonds or C=C double bonds, they have characteristic structural features and differences in physical as well as chemical properties and have significant roles in the constitution of cellular membranes. Omega () is used to denote the position of double bonds from the methyl end of the fatty acid. Colored curved arrows =biological conversion is possible from the precursor by the actions of elongase/desaturase enzymes. Black arrow =indicates the position(s) of double bond. Which fatty acids does it have? The straight chain structural features of the most common fatty acids. Most of them are not essential. Fatty A cidsynthesis starts with citrate conversion to acetyl-Coenzyme A and the malonyl-Coenzyme A, which is then elongated to form palmitate and other Fatty Acids . Key enzymes in this process are acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), which catalyzes the DNL (de novo lipogenesis ) limiting step reaction, and the Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS). Coenzyme A is synthesized with the help of Vitamin B5, penthonic acid. 23Synthesis of fatty acids occurs in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum of the cell and is chemically similar to the beta-oxidation process, but with a couple of key differences. The first of these occur in preparing substrates for the reactions that grow the fatty acid. Transport of acetyl-CoA from the mitochondria occurs when it begins to build up. Two molecules can play roles in moving it to the cytoplasm - citrate and acetylcarnitine. Joining of oxaloacetate with acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrion creates citrate which moves across the membrane, followed by action of citrate lyase in the cytoplasm of the cell to release acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. Additionally, when free acetyl-CoA accumulates in the mitochondrion, it may combine with carnitine and be transported out to the cytoplasm.24 All non essential fatty acids are synthesized in body with the help of Coenzyme A, which is made with the help of Vitamin B5 In this illustration, the hydrophobic methyl (CH4) tails are at the left, the carboxyl (COOH) heads are at the right. PLA=palmitic acid, non essential,. STA=stearic acid, non essential OLA=oleic acid, non essential LLA= Linoleic-Acid, or Parent Omega-6-LA, an essential fatty acid, which means it must be eaten. LLN = -linolenic acid or Parent Omega-3-ALA.It is essential, which means it can only be obtained from diet. AA=arachidonic acid (a non essential Omega 6 fatty acid. Synthesized in the body from Omega 6LA) EPA=eicosapentaenoic acid (a non essential Omega-3 fatty acid, only found in the eyes and brains. The body synthesizes it itsself from Omega-3 ALA.) DHA=docosahexaenoic acid.25 (a Omega-3 .The body synthesizes it itsself from Omega-3 ALA.) Cell Membrane Fluidity The composition of a membrane affects its fluidity. Cell membrane fluidity is affected by fatty acids. Whether the fatty acids are saturated or unsaturated has an effect on membrane fluidity. Saturated fatty acids have no double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain, and the maximum amount of hydrogen. .In their saturated form, the fatty acids in phospholipid tails are saturated with bound hydrogen atoms and there are no double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms. Saturated lipids result in tails that are relatively straight. Thus, if saturated fatty acids, with their straight tails, are compressed by decreasing temperatures, they press in on each other, making a dense and fairly rigid membrane. The absence of double bonds decreases fluidity, making the membrane very rigid and tightly stacked In contrast, unsaturated fatty acids do not contain a maximal number of hydrogen atoms, although they do contain some double bonds between adjacent carbon atoms. Unsaturated fatty acids have at least one double bond, creating a \"kink\" in the chain. The double bond increases fluidity. A double bond results in a bend of approximately 30 degrees in the string of carbons. While the individual lipids may be more rigid, membranes made with such lipids are more fluid and have lower melting points, which means less thermal energy is required to achieve the same level of fluidity as membranes made with lipids with saturated hydrocarbon chains. If unsaturated fatty acids are compressed, the \"kinks\" in their tails elbow adjacent phospholipid molecules away, maintaining some space between the phospholipid molecules. This \"elbow room\" helps to maintain fluidity in the membrane at temperatures at which membranes with saturated fatty acid tails in their phospholipids would \"freeze\" or solidify. 28 Lipid chains with carbon-carbon double bonds (unsaturated) are more rigid than lipids that are saturated with hydrogens, as double bonds cannot freely turn. Because of this rigidity, unsaturated double bonds make it harder for the lipids to pack together by putting kinks into the otherwise straightened hydrocarbon chain. 30 Lipids with shorter chains are less stiff and less viscous because they are more susceptible to changes in kinetic energy du dueto their smaller molecular size and they have less surface area to undergo stabilizing London forces with neighboring hydrophobic chains. The London dispersion force is the weakest intermolecular force. The London dispersion force is a temporary attractive force that results when the electrons in two adjacent atoms occupy positions that make the atoms form temporary dipoles. This force is sometimes called an induced dipole-induced dipole attraction. London forces are the attractive forces that cause nonpolar substances to condense to liquids and to freeze into solids when the temperature is lowered sufficiently.31 Incorporation of particular lipids, such as sphingomyelin, into synthetic lipid membranes is known to stiffen a membrane. Such membranes can be described as \"a glass state, i.e., rigid but without crystalline order\". Temperature Another way to increase membrane fluidity is to heat up the membrane. Lipids acquire thermal energy when they are heated up; energetic lipids move around more, arranging and rearranging randomly, making the membrane more fluid. At low temperatures, the lipids are laterally ordered and organized in the membrane, and the lipid chains are mostly in the all-trans configuration and pack well together. So when yo get a fever, membrane fluidity increases, easing the expulsion of toxins as well as the availibility of anti toxins. The melting temperature of a membrane is defined as the temperature across which the membrane transitions from a crystal-like to a fluid-like organization, or viceversa. This phase transition is not an actual state transition, but the two levels of organizations are very similar to a solid and liquid state. The membrane is in crystalline phase when the level of order in the bi-layer is high and the fluidity is low. T_{m}}\" width=\"2 height=\"2> The membrane is in liquid-crystal phase when the membrane is less ordered and more fluid. At 37\u00b0C, this is the state of the membrane. The correcting presence of cholesterol, however, allows for the membrane stabilization and a more compact organization The mosaic characteristic of the membrane helps the plasma membrane remain fluid. The integral proteins and lipids exist in the membrane as separate but loosely-attached molecules. 34 However, because of its mosaic nature, a very fine needle can easily penetrate a plasma membrane without causing it to burst. The membrane will flow and self-seal when the needle is extracted.35 If saturated fatty acids are compressed by decreasing temperatures, they press in on each other, making a dense and fairly rigid membrane. If unsaturated fatty acids are compressed, the \"kinks\" in their tails push adjacent phospholipid molecules away, which helps maintain fluidity in the membrane. The ratio of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids determines the fluidity in the membrane at cold temperatures. Cholesterol functions as a buffer, preventing lower temperatures from inhibiting fluidity and preventing higher temperatures from increasing fluidity.36 Cholesterol corrects fluidity Another factor that keeps the membrane fluid is cholesterol. Cell membrane fluidity is also affected by cholesterol. Cholesterol can correct the cell membrane fluidity, making it more rigid when it tends to get too fluid and making it more fluid when it tends to get too rigid, Cholesterol lies alongside the phospholipids in the membrane and tends to dampen the effects of temperature on the membrane. Thus, cholesterol functions as a buffer, preventing lower temperatures or a high amount of saturated fats from inhibiting fluidity and preventing higher temperatures or an overdose of unsaturated fats, which can happen if you eat the derivatives rather than the parent forms, from increasing fluidity too much. Cholesterol extends in both directions the range of temperature in which the membrane is appropriately fluid and, consequently, functional. Cholesterol also serves other functions, such as organizing clusters of transmembrane proteins into lipid rafts.37 Lipid rafts are plasma membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids that are involved in the lateral compartmentalization of molecules at the cell surface. Internalization of ligands and receptors by these domains occurs via a process defined as raft-dependent endocytosis. 38 Sphingolipids are enriched in the Central Nervous System (CNS) and display multiple biological functions. They participate in tissue development, cell recognition and adhesion, and act as receptors for toxins.39 Viscosity of the membrane can affect the oxygenation of the cell40, rotation and diffusion of proteins and other bio-molecules within the membrane, there-by affecting their functions. You want to prevent cholesterol from having to step in though, because cholesterol is a much worse diffuser of oxygen than fatty acids are. It is however a very bad idea to take cholesterol inhibitors, because in doing so you sabotage the body's bmechanism of regulating cell rigidity. The importance of oxygenation The availability of oxygen (O2) within cells and tissues has significant biomedical implications. Indeed, cellular oxygenation is a critical parameter in tumor therapy, anesthesia, wound healing, reperfusion injury, adipose tissue dysfunction, as well as brain function and possibly neuronal hypometabolism . Tissue-level hypoxia may select tumor cells resistant to apoptosis, and hypoxic cycling may favor tumor aggression and resistance to therapy [. Moreover, hypoxia is a major barrier to progress in tissue engineering, as 3D-printed cells toward the center of engineered constructs tend to languish and die because of poor diffusional oxygen delivery. 41 Oxygen is known to play a key role in cellular energetics. Both oxidation and other forms of energy production depend on a continuous supply of oxygen to the cells. In mammals, oxygen is extracted from the atmospheric air in the lungs, and carried by the bloodstream through the circulation to the tissue, where it is utilized mainly within the mitochondria. 42 How important are the resistances to transport provided by various membranes (red blood cell, endothelial cell, parenchymal cell) along the pathway? Does oxygen cross these membranes by pure diffusion, or is the diffusion facilitated by a carrier? 43 Krogh laid the foundation of the theory of oxygen transport to tissue. He proposed that oxygen is transported in the tissue by passive diffusion driven by gradients of oxygen tension.44 Under normal conditions in human circulation, each milliliter of blood carries about 0.2 ml of oxygen. In arterial blood, about 98% of this oxygen is reversibly bound to a protein, hemoglobin, contained within the red blood cells, and the remaining oxygen is in a free form, dissolved in both blood plasma and in the hemoglobin solution inside the red blood cells. 45 The total amount of oxygen carried by blood as 0.204 ml of oxygen per milliliter blood. Only 1.5% of oxygen is in the dissolved form provided that hemoglobin is completely saturated. 46 Krogh believed that red cell cytoplasm and the cell membrane can present a large resistance to oxygen diffusion. 47 Later researchers thought the red cell membrane resistance constitutes only a small fraction of the total resistance to oxygen transport, whereas the main portion of the remaining resistance is located within the incompletely stirred diffusion boundary layer immediately outside the erythrocyte surface. 48Huxley and Kutchai 49expressed the total diffusion resistance outside the red cell cytosol as the sum of the membrane transport resistance and the diffusion boundary layer resistance. The best estimate from this study showed that only 5% of the total resistance could be attributed to the membrane. If it is assumed that all of the resistance is concentrated in the membrane, then the diffusion coefficient for oxygen in the membrane would have to be 1.2\u00b7107cm2/s, i.e., about 100 times smaller than in water. This conclusion would be in disagreement with the value of D for the membrane measured by the fluorescence quenching of pyrene (Fishkoff and Vanderkooi37). This method predicted a much larger value D = 0.7\u00b7105 cm2/s, i.e., approximately five times smaller than in water. These results suggest that the membrane poses a negligible resistance to oxygen transport. 50 In the capillaries, oxygen is transported within red cells through the solution of hemoglobin, then through the cell membrane and the blood plasma. Since cells and plasma are in motion, both convection and diffusion (free and facilitated) may be important. It was recognized early that the red cell cytosol has a finite resistance to oxygen transport, which results in a gradient of oxygen tension between the interior of the cell and the plasma surrounding the cell (Hartridge and Roughton61). In fact, the rapid-mixing experiments and their analyses discussed above suggest that both the cell interior and the plasma surrounding the cell resist oxygen diffusion, 511. Transport in Plasma Gaps between Red Blood Cells Oxygen in the plasma can be transported by both convection and diffusion. 52 Convection is the movement caused within a fluid by the tendency of hotter and therefore less dense material to rise, and colder, denser material to sink under the influence of gravity, which consequently results in transfer of heat. 53 Diffusion, process resulting from random motion of molecules by which there is a net flow of matter from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. A study from1999 could explain the different ideas about oxygen diffusion through cell membranes. It shows that cholesterol is inibits oxygen diffusuin.54 A study done in 2021 concludes: The common assumption that oxygen diffuses primarily by way of aqueous pathways is challenged by contemporary understanding of cells and tissues as complex and crowded macromolecular environments. Rather, evidence to date supports a model of lipid-accelerated oxygen diffusion within membranes and lipid droplets held in close proximity by protein contacts.55 Osmosis can cause cell membranes to burst in case of over hydration or too little salt, or to shrivel up when there is too much salt or too little fluid. Water will continue to flow until equilibrium is reached (when the concentration inside the cell is equal to the concentration outside the cell) or when the cell cannot take on any more water and bursts .56Cytolysis, also known as osmotic lysis, occurs when a cell bursts and releases its contents into the extracellular environment due to a great influx of water into the cell, far exceeding the capacity of the cell membrane to contain the extra volume.57 When due to much water intake or too little salt intake the plasma becomes much less salt than the inside of the cell, the cell will keep taking up water until the concentration inside matches that of the outside. A red blood cell will swell and undergo hemolysis (burst) when placed in a hypotonic solution. When placed in a hypertonic solution, a red blood cell will lose water and undergo crenation (shrivel). 58 When a person consumes an excessive amount of water and cells in their brain start to swell, the pressure inside their skull increases. This causes the first symptoms of water intoxication, which include: 8Eukaryotic Cell: Eukaryotic cells are defined as cells containing organized nucleus and organelles which are enveloped by membrane-bound organelles.

This is a concern particularly for cells that do not have a tough cell wall to resist internal water pressure,Biology Dictionary, Cytolysis Definition, Update April 28, 2017, https://biologydictionary.net/cytolysis/ Johanna Budwig noticed that people with cancer not only had much less Omega-3-ALA in their blood than healthy people, she also found a greenish slime in the blood of those who had cancer. She created a diet that enhanced the Omega-3-ALA levels in the blood, that cleared the green slime as the cancer in a week. Like Revici, she used sulfur, but she did it through diet and her results were more spectacular. With Revici the tumors were killed but took months to disappear. With Johanna Budwig they disappeared within a week. So when Budwig combines quark with flaxseeds and sunflowerseeds, she is doing with food the sulfur-lipid therapy Revici did. In the e4dc flaxseeds and sunflower seeds are eaten with milk kefir,which has added probiotic effects. I have the answer to cancer, but American doctors won't listen. They come here and observe my methods and are impressed. Then they want to make a special deal so they can take it home and make a lot of money. I won't do it, so I'm blackballed in every country.- Dr Johanna Budwig.1 Basically, it's a combination of flaxseed oil, cottage cheese, organic foods, herbal and homeopathic formulas, exercise, fresh air and sunbathing in a controlled and healthy way. Her simple techniques provided patients with renewed energy and visible improvements, sometimes, within days. 5 Johanna Budwig, was a pharmacist and biochemist.with a PhD in natural sciences who had studied the blood of cancer patients for over 30 years. She also found that there was a greenish, yellowish slime in the blood of cancer patients. Dr. Budwig also discovered that in general, blood that comes from a healthy person contains far greater levels of Omega-3-ALA essential fatty acids than blood samples taken from someone who is ill.7 After this discovery, she immediately started developing a diet and nutritional guidelines to cure cancer. And this resulted in an oil/protein paste which is still known as the 'budwig porridge'. Because of her success in healing cancer in patients who were given up by conventional doctors, Dr Johanna Budwig had been a nominee for the Nobel Prize seven times.8 In an interview in 2000 with the one she nominated the head of the Budwig Institute, Dr. Lloyd Jenkins, she said: \"From 1939 on, I was in charge of the dispensary in a military hospital with 5000 beds. In 1949, I returned to Dr. Kaufmann's facility in Munster at his request and I was immediately assigned the post of State Expert for Chemical Research on Drugs and Fats. As part of an evaluation of drugs based on sulfhydryl groups, I was confronted with the fact that no blood-chemical measure existed to test fat metabolism.\"9 The development of paper chromatography In the late 1940s, Dr. Johanna Budwig succeeded in developing a process by which fats could be broken down and analyzed based on their smallest components. A great achievement for both Dr. Johanna Budwig as well as for the entire scientific community. \"It was through the development of paper chromatography in the field of lipid research- in other words, through novel examination of fatty substances on paper- which I (Dr. Budwig) initially carried out in 1949 without any idea of how great an impact it would have on the entire field of medicine, which allowed a thousandth of a milligram of fat to be analyzed on paper. One thousandth of a milligram of fat, taken from approximately one drop of blood, could now be separated into its various constituents and could accurately characterized according to its various fatty acid components. \" - Dr. Johanna Budwig With this new analysis method came innovative, reliable understanding regarding fatty acids. She was now also able to differentiate between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. As a result, Dr. Johanna Budwig was able to identify flax seed as a significant source of highly unsaturated fatty acids. In the following years, she devoted herself passionately researching its properties. She says: So I decided straight away to go for human trials and enrolled 600 patients from four big hospitals in Munster (Germany). I started to give flax oil and cottage cheese to the cancer patients. After just three months, patients began to improve in health and strength, the yellow- green substance in their blood began to disappear, tumors gradually receded...I treated approximately 2500 cancer patients in the last few decades.10 This was Dr. Johanna Budwig's first scientific breakthrough. 11 It was a logical folloe up of Revici's findings of Omega-3-ALAand Omega 6LA's cancer fighting properties, as well as the Burrs's discovery of Omega-3-ALAand Omega 6LA as essential nutrients. As a scientist, she will have been familiar with their work. Otto Warburg discovered that many known chronic illnesses including cancer occur because of A lack of oxygen in the body So these findings were not unique to Dr. Budwig. What was unique to her was her dietary approach to healing cancer. She linked cancer to the consumption of refined or partially hydrogenated oils and sugars and to as eficiency in essential fatty acids12 These trans fats are found in commonly used cooking oils. Most companies extract oil from corn, sunflower seeds, and other plants through extreme heat, and other artificial processes, none of which are the natural extraction procedure. As a result, these oils are no longer alive and are no longer advisable for consumption. Additionally, when the heavy oils incorporate into our cell membranes, they destroy the electric charge. Without that charge, our cells start to suffocate due to a lack of oxygen. Trans fats are also a trigger factor for Type II Diabetes since insulin is a large molecule, and trans fats challenge the molecule's entry through the cell membrane. Dr. Budwig examined the blood of her patients under a microscope before and after administering her mix of flaxseed oil and quark. She found that the blood no longer clumped together, and a substance displaying a greenish color was no longer present. Instead, the red was much brighter, which is a very positive indicator and a sign of improvement and increased oxygen intake. After extensive research, in 1950 she was able to present these groundbreaking results together with Dr. Kaufmann- which had been published in the same year under the title 'New methods of lipid analysis' in the journal 'Fats and Soaps'- at the Munich Lipid Researchers Conference. In fact, our current understanding of the components and the effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids is in large part based on her findings Proof of Trans fats Evidence of the harmfulness of trans fats In 1951, Dr. Johanna Budwig was appointed as the expert consultant with regard to pharmaceutical products and fatty acids at the Federal Institute for Lipid Research. Simultaneously, she began researching commercial fats, and had thus- without even knowing it- engaged a powerful opponent. Post-war Germany was experiencing an economic revival. Gone were the times of rations and butter substitutes- people were finally able to indulge themselves again. Rich and plentiful food was what the people sought after. The German food industry reported record profits. It was not an ideal time to be a fatty acid researcher whose studies in 1952 confirmed the harmfulness of trans fats. These findings were met by an outcry from the young, but powerful margarine industry, whose claims she refuted with meticulously kept statistical records. For her- a scientist first and foremost- publishing results was obviously top priority. Dr. Johanna Budwig reflected upon these circumstances in her renowned, scientific books. From this point on she found herself unable to ignore the obvious relationship between diet and disease progression. She continued to immerse herself in the relevant subject matter. Using animal models in 1957, she was able to demonstrate the different effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the body. In the case of a heart attack, we are presented with an anatomical picture which shows us that the only thing out of the ordinary is dietary fat- fat which has hardened around the otherwise lean heart muscle, encasing it and interfering with its normal activity. In patients affected by rheumatism, the only characteristic that distinguishes muscle from afflicted patients from that of healthy patients are fats which have been excreted- a clear rejection of this type of fat by the living organism. In 1957 at the international conference for nutrition, where 900 specialists from all over the world presented their latest scientific findings at the Institute for Cancer Research in Paris, the sole detectable substance or phenomenon reported which set cancer cells apart from their healthy counterparts was that fats which had been excreted were visible in the cell bodies and their nuclei, as well as in the cytoplasm. [...] [...] I had the opportunity in the context of the above mentioned location to pose the question: 'why search for what is behind the phenomenon? Why not examine the phenomenon itself instead?' Fats which have been expelled- a clear rejection of these substances.15 Dr. Emanuel Revici, (Bucharest, September 6, 1896- New York, January 9, 1998),-non-toxic lipid chemo therapy, including Omega-3-ALA and Omega-6-LA, We are fully entitled to consider my approach as a highly beneficial treatment. When correctly applied it can in many cases even bring advanced malignancies under control. -Dr. Emanuel Revici Health is based on two dynamic forces in all living organisms\"Catabolism (breaking down, acidic) and Anabolism (building up, alkeline). -Dr. Emanuel Revici Did the Burrs influence Dr Emanuel Revici (Bucharest, September 6, 1896- New York, January 9, 1998), or did he influence them? They were first to publish, but he had researched Linoleic-Acid before they did. Dr. Emanuel Revici pioneered nontoxic lipid treatments for cancer in the mid-1920s . He has treated cancer for70 years and cured thousands and thousands and thousands of patients of cancer 1 He was the first research clinician to treat cancer with Omega-3-ALA 2. Combining Newtonian physics and quantum mechanics, he redefined lipids, accurately describing their molecular activity, organization, and properties 3 .He used Omega-3-ALA combined with sulfur to cure cancer 4. Sulfur in the lipid works. Just the sulfur does not work, for example sulfur in a water solution does not work. The Omega-3-ALAcovered sulfur is taken by the lipids in the red blood cells and goes where there is a free lipid, This takes only 15 minutes whether you inject it or ingest it.Within 15 minutes the pain stops, It is even a way for detecting tumors5. Dr Revici said that this combination of sulfur with Omega-3-ALA killed tumors in rats and in people. The tumor is dead after a month, but takes a 3 or 4 months to disappear. Once it is dead, it does not cause any pain anymore. The bags, as Jacques Dubochet calls our cell membranes, are made of lipids, among which Linoleic-Acid (Omega-6-LA) and Alpha Linolenic Acid (Omega-3-ALA) are essential and key to immunity, And the only free lipids are where there are lesions in the cell membrane, which is why any Linoleic-Acid or Alpha Linolenic Acid we ingest, with its strong polarity, is attracted to the lesion and does what is necessary to heal us. The incident that precipitated Emanuel Revici's awareness of the importance of essential fatty acids came from a most unlikely series of events. During his time as a professor, Revici saw on his operating table a young, pregnant woman, surgically opened up, whose abdomen was full of cancer. He closed her up, thinking she didn't have long to live and never expected to see her alive again. Two years later, in 1928, the apparently healthy woman returned to see Revici with her small child. Revici wondered how it was possible for the woman to still be alive. The mystery would not leave his mind. He knew that neither exploratory surgery nor pregnancy by themselves would have a curative effect on the course of a malignant tumor, so he theorized about the possibility that her dramatic recovery was due to the simultaneous occurrence of both events. He began to study the placenta and noticed that it was rich in fat-soluble products called lipids. He then experimented with animals, testing different placental lipids to see if they would have any effect on the course of cancer, and went on to form his essential fatty acid based, non-toxic chemotherapy,with which he cured many diseases, among which, cancer. In this lecture6 from 1986, Dr Revici says that free fatty acids only occur in the lesions. A lesion is any damage or abnormal change in the tissue of an organism, usually caused by disease or trauma. Lesion is derived from the Latin laesio \"injury\". 7The ingested or injected fatty acids with sulfur survive the stomache, are transported through the blood and bind to the free fatty acids in the tumor and kill the cancer. He calls that the secret of his therapy.8 It is an atomic absorption. His discovery has 3 parts. 1. the lipid: 2. he combines the lipid with the substance that he wants to transport to the tumor, like berylium, sulfur, or selenium. (all catabolic, acidic) 3. The lipid brings the substance to the cancer, because it brings it to the free lipid. So you have a targeted approach this way. sulfur works best. Lipids are mostly in the membrane of the cell. They are in the membrane of the chromosome. Where there is a membrane, there is a lipid. We are a lipidic world, totally dependant on lipids. The lipid we ingest finds the lesion, because that's the only place where there are free lipids. So the ingested lipid binds to free lipids, thus targetting the cancer. Dr Revici says that elements and vitamins are anabolic (constructive, alkaline) or catabolic (destructive, acidic) in nature. The schedule below shows which he categorized as anabolic and which as catabolic. Revici's Periodic Chart of Anabolic and Catabolic Elements Revici also emphasized the psychological aspect, that they had hope again and that helped with the healing as well. Heisihting for lie biologically and spiritually He said chemotherapy and radiation do not work. His treatment with Omega-3-ALAand sulfur works against AIDS as well He saw cancer as a parasite,The tumor is painful when it reaches the connective tissue sulfur lipids work against cancer. 14 Dr Revici advises to take the sulfur-lipid combination once a week as a preventative measure against cancer. Johanna Budwig also used the sulfur lipid combination to cure cancer. Only she did it with porridge, and her results were more spectacular than Revici's. Revici's method killed the cancer quickly, but then it would take months for the cancer to disappear, In the e4dc we use milk kefir, flaxseeds and sunflower seeds, Milk kefir has much more sulfur than cottage cheese or yoghurt, and the probiotics in kefir fight cancer as well, 5Revici's research has demonstrated that lipids have an affinity for tumors and other abnormal tissues. Because of this, the lipids or lipid-like synthetic compounds administered to the patient, either by mouth or injection, travel directly to the tumor or lesion. Cancerous tissue is abnormally rich in free lipids, and the lipidic agents introduced into the bloodstream are readily taken up by the tumor.

These are either placed in the core or on the bottom of the pan, or they can be layered in tri-ply or 5-ply layers (also called cladding), which is a feature of many high-quality cookware brands. Most stainless steel cookware, however, is not just stainless steel. As a poor heat conductor, stainless steel is best combined with a heat-conducting material, like copper. These are either placed in the core or on the bottom of the pan, or they can be layered in tri-ply or 5-ply layers (also called cladding), which is a feature of many high-quality cookware brands. The Differences between cast iron and stainless steel when Cleaning and Cooking The advantage of stainless steel is you can gauge just how \"nonstick\" you want the surface to be. Making a crunchy stir-fry? One to two tablespoons of oil should do. Whipping up a cheese omelet? Coat the pan with about 1/8 inch of oil then pour out the excess. Give the pan a good wipe with a paper towel, and you've made yourself a relatively nonstick stainless steel surface. This versatility makes stainless steel pans great for all kinds of cooking: making pan sauces, sauteing vegetables, searing scallops, and most quick everyday dishes. Wooden spoons give you a firm strong handle to hold, making stirring easier and more effective-and without any fear of the handle breaking. ... Plastic spoons can begin to melt. Wooden spoons don't conduct heat so you can stir until your heart's content without fear of the handle heating up. If it is too difficult for you to get the aloe vera out of the leaf, find an organic aloe vera, witout alo\u00efne or additives, like this one, and instead of mixing it with the oil like you would do with the gel from the leaf, drink a teaspoon of it before consuming the omega saus. For several years they lived in refugee camps until they found refuge in Austria and settled down in Grieskirchen in 1951. She died in 1991. Treben became famous through her two books: Health Through God's Pharmacy and Maria Treben's Cures.The first was translated into 24 languages and sold over 8 million copies. Treben addressed seminars and presented at natural health conferences in Germany, Austria and across Europe, attracting hundreds of people. She is perceived as a pioneer of the renewed interest for natural remedies and traditional medicine at the end of the 20th used her own recipes as well as traditional healing remedies like Swedish bitters that she used as a cure-all. Some of her remedies and advice proved to be controversial, such as some of the more esoteric ingredients used in the greater swedish bitters recipe. To this day she is widely read and referred to for her knowledge of European medicinal herbs. Very Well Health writes: Greater celandine (Chelidonium majus) is a plant commonly grown in Asia, Central and Southern Europe, and North America. An extract derived from the plant has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine. Often touted as a natural treatment for cancer, greater celandine is also purported to fight health concerns ranging from asthma to atherosclerosis.1 Although research suggests that greater celandine may offer certain benefits, there's also some evidence that it might be toxic to the liver and using it may cause other harmful side effects.2 What Is Greater Celandine Used For? In alternative medicine, greater celandine is said to boost the immune system and be a natural remedy for a number of health conditions, including:1 In one double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled multi-center trial involving 120 participants, gastrointestinal symptoms improved in the group who was treated with a greater celandine-containing herbal preparation for four weeks.3 A meta-analysis examining the effects of an herbal preparation containing greater celandine showed similar results, with an improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with herbal treatment.4 Due to a lack of high-quality clinical trials and serious safety concerns, greater celandine cannot currently be recommended for treatment or prevention of any health problem, including cancer.5 Cancer In laboratory tests on human cancer cells, scientists found that greater celandine may fight cancer by inducing apoptosis, a type of programmed cell death involved in stopping the spread of cancer cells.1 Results revealed that greater celandine significantly reduced the severity of several eczema symptoms, including itching and inflammation. However, it's unknown whether greater celandine might have the same effect on eczema in humans. Little is known about the safety of long-term or regular use of greater celandine and how it might interact with medication. Greater celandine may trigger a number of side effects, including nausea, dizziness, fatigue, and fever.9 Greater celandine may harm liver health. In a report published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology in 2009, for instance, scientists warn that several cases of acute hepatitis have been linked to greater celandine consumption in previously published studies.10 A 2017 report published in the European Review for Medical Pharmacological Sciences in fact concluded that the risks of greater celadrine use outweigh the potential benefits.5 Given the safety concerns, it's critical to consult your healthcare provider prior to using greater celandine, especially if you have a history of liver problems. Also, keep in mind that supplements like greater celandine are largely unregulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). According to government standards, it is illegal to market a dietary supplement as a treatment or cure for a specific disease or its symptoms. Likewise, these products are not tested by the FDA for safety or effectiveness.11 Published: Apr 25, 2018 \u00b7 Modified: Sep 30, 2019 by Susan Patterson \u00b7 This post may contain affiliate links \u00b7 Wild garlic, also known as ramsons or ramps, grows free in abundance on many lands open to foraging. In North America, it's widespread across the eastern U.S. and eastern Canada, growing all the way from Missouri and Minnesota, as far north as Quebec and in higher elevations in the south, though it can also be found in areas along the west coast. It's a distant relative of chives that delivers a particularly unique take on this, especially ubiquitous ingredient. You don't eat the bulbs, rather the pungent leaves. It's something that's commonly used among Native Americans for both healing and cooking purposes, and it's often featured in Central Appalachian dishes. Wild garlic is a collection of species in the Allium genus and offers many of the same characteristics as the garlic cloves you've probably been using for years. Medicinally speaking, it can certainly be considered a superfood. It's known as the most effective broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent with nearly 40 different anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory, bacterial, parasitic and viral agents. Plants in the allium family like garlic, contain a compound known as allicin, which is not only responsible for the distinct smell, but for its many potential biological effects that can help cure many different ailments and support good overall health. This flavorful plant may best be known for flavoring dishes, but it's also one of the best natural antibiotics on Earth. Research in 2012 from Washington State University found that it was 100 times more effective than two of the most commonly used antibiotics for fighting off a bacteria called Campylobacter, something that's responsible for multiple intestinal ailments around the world. It can even kill strains of staph and bacteria that have become immune to modern antibiotics. This is something we've known for centuries, long before science ever proved its abilities. In fact, garlic has been used for thousands of years as a healing agent, even utilized to ward off the plague in the 18th century. As mentioned, wild garlic offers many beneficial properties for the body. Other than its use as a natural antibiotic, it's ability to detoxify, removing harmful toxins from the body, may be the most important. Keeping the body free of toxins and other potentially harmful substances is one of the key factors in overall health and longevity. A 2012 study published in the journal Basic & Clinical Pharmacology demonstrated that garlic was just as effective at eliminating lead from the body as d-penicillamine, minus the serious side effects. Lead poisoning, as the researchers noted, accounts for 0.2 percent of all deaths worldwide. Unfortunately, the heavy metal that was once commonly used in paints, is still used in some places today despite the fact that it's widely known to potentially cause damage to the digestive, cardiovascular and skeletal systems, with particularly devastating impacts on the reproductive organs, nervous system, and kidneys. It is known to have significant negative effects on the kidneys, nervous system and reproductive organs. Of course, the detoxifying properties of garlic don't just apply to lead, but the long list of other toxins we're all exposed to from day to day. There are toxins in many of the foods we consume, in the air we breathe, in cleaning products, secondhand smoke and more. 3. SUPPORTING GOOD CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH THROUGH BETTER BLOOD PRESSURE AND CHOLESTEROL LEVELS The instance of cardiovascular disease is typically lower in populations that consume lots of garlic. One of the reasons for that may be that garlic has the ability to reduce high blood pressure, or hypertension. A 2013 study out of Saudi Arabia's King Khalid University published in the Pakistan Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, revealed that garlic was at least as effective as the powerful blood pressure lowering medication atenolol for decreasing both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in participants who'd been diagnosed with essential hypertension. Garlic can also help improve cholesterol levels, further supporting heart health. It lowers both overall cholesterol and LDL, otherwise known as the \"bad\" cholesterol as shown in numerous studies. On average, studies have shown that it may reduce LDL and total cholesterol by about 15 percent. 4. REGULATING BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS A 2012 study on diabetic rabbits found that garlic offers hypoglycemic effects, meaning that it can help lower or maintain normal blood sugar levels. A review of studies in 2014, also supported the idea that consuming garlic regularly can help lower blood glucose levels. 5. SLOWING THE AGING PROCESS AND PREVENTING BRAIN AGING DISEASES LIKE DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMER'S When your body suffers from oxidative damage caused by free radicals, that serves to speed aging. Wild garlic provides antioxidants that help to support the body's defenses to protect against oxidative damage. Multiple studies have found that garlic has been linked to increased antioxidant enzymes in addition to the ability to reduce oxidative stress. The combined effects of lowering both cholesterol and blood pressure, coupled with garlic's potent antioxidant properties, may help prevent common brain aging diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's. WILD GARLIC RECIPES There are so many delicious ways to make use of your wild garlic, you'll want to get out there and start foraging now. You can use it in pretty much any dish where you'd use garlic or leeks. While the leaves are tasty raw they can be a bit too garlicky for most, but you may be able to use them with more mild tasting greens in a salad. Cooking tempers the flavor significantly, so you can also wilt the young leaves and stems, similar to spinach, or add them to a soup. Thoroughly wash, rinse and dry your wild garlic leaves and then place them in a high powered blender or food processor. Add the olive oil and salt, and then blend into a puree. Store the oil in a lidded glass jar, placing an extra layer of olive oil on top to preserve it. If you don't plan to use it all within a week or so, freeze it in ice cube trays and then place the frozen cubes into a Ziploc-style bag. WILD GARLIC 'NO-MAYO' MAYONNAISE SUBSTITUTE Ingredients: 2 ripe avocados 1/2 cup cashews, pine nuts, or hemp hearts A handful of wild garlic leaves 3-4 sprigs of parsley 2 tbsp organic olive oil Juice of half of one lemon 1/2 cup of water Pinch of salt, paprika, and chili or cayenne powder Directions: Add all ingredients to a large bowl and blend until smooth. If you need to, add more water. Store what isn't immediately used in a lidded glass jar, pouring a bit of olive oil on top to preserve it. More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of calamus for these uses. Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate (detailed description of each of the ratings). SIDE EFFECTS Calamus is LIKELY UNSAFE when taken by mouth. It can cause kidney damage, shaking, and seizures. The FDA prohibits calamus use in food products because three of the four species of calamus found in the world contain a cancer-causing chemical called beta-isoasarone. However, the beta-isoasarone content can vary widely among species from 0% to 96%. Some products may be safer than others. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Calamus is LIKELY UNSAFE when taken by mouth during pregnancy or breast-feeding. Avoid use. Heart conditions: Calamus might lower blood pressure and heart rate. In theory, large amounts of calamus might worsen heart problems in some people with heart conditions. Low blood pressure: Calamus might lower blood pressure. In theory, taking calamus might make blood pressure become too low in people with low blood pressure. Surgery: Calamus can affect the central nervous system. It might cause too much sleepiness if combined with medications used during and after surgery. If you are using calamus despite safety concerns, stop using it at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery. INTERACTIONS Drying medications (Anticholinergic drugs)Interaction Rating: Moderate Be cautious with this combination.Talk with your health provider. Calamus might increase levels of certain chemical in the body that work in the brain, heart, and elsewhere. Some drying medications called \"anticholinergic drugs\" can also increase these chemicals, but in a different way. These drying medications might decrease the effects of calamus, and calamus might decrease the effects of drying medications. Some of these drying medications include atropine, scopolamine, some medications used for allergies (antihistamines), and some medications used for depression (antidepressants). Medications for Alzheimer's disease (Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors)Interaction Rating: Moderate Be cautious with this combination.Talk with your health provider.

Nettle is a herb that is known for its medicinal properties. It is mostly consumed in its tea form to improve several health aspects like heart issues, gut health, immunity development, kidney function enhancement, allergy reduction, UTI treatment and arthritis pain. It is a powerful blood purifier that drives out toxins from the body, making it the perfect addition to your daily routine to stay healthy. The anti-oxidant levels and vitamins A and C in nettle tea help in boosting the immune system. The anti-oxidants present in nettle protect the immune system against damage and help to strengthen immunity. Scientists at Hacettepe University in Turkey found that nettle stimulates T-cells which help the body to fight against infection and other diseases which can weaken the immune system. Now, it only takes a couple of steps to make this tea at your home! So, follow the instructions here. Generally, one cup of nettle leaves should be added to two cups of water to prepare this tea. While this plant may prove a promising natural remedy for hay fever symptoms, more long-term human studies are needed. SUMMARYStinging nettle may reduce hay fever symptoms. Yet, some research indicates that it may not be much more effective than a placebo. More studies are needed on stinging nettle's effects on hay fever. 5. May Lower Blood Pressure Approximately one in three American adults has high blood pressure (19Trusted Source). High blood pressure is a serious health concern because it puts you at risk of heart disease and strokes, which are among the leading causes of death worldwide (20Trusted Source). Stinging nettle was traditionally used to treat high blood pressure (21Trusted Source). Animal and test-tube studies illustrate that it may help lower blood pressure in several ways. In animal studies, stinging nettle has been shown to lower blood pressure levels while raising the heart's antioxidant defenses (24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source). However, stinging nettle's effects on blood pressure in humans are still unclear. Additional human studies are needed before recommendations can be made. SUMMARYStinging nettle may help lower blood pressure by allowing your blood vessels to relax and reducing the force of your heart's contractions. Yet, more human studies are needed to confirm these effects.

Other Potential Benefits Stinging nettle may offer other potential health benefits, including: Reduced bleeding: Medicines containing stinging nettle extract have been found to reduce excessive bleeding, especially after surgery (32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source). Natural diuretic: This plant may help your body shed excess salt and water, which in turn could lower blood pressure temporarily. Keep in mind that these findings are from animal studies (31Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source). A recipe for tincture is: fill a bottle with Lady's Mantle Herb, cover them with 40% ABV alcohol. Macerate for 3 weeks. Daily dosage is 2- 4 ml before the meal. You can take it up to 3 weeks. For the hip-bath, you can use the whole plant or just boil 4 tablespoons of Lady's Mantle Herb in 500 ml of water. You also add grounded Comfrey Root,English Plantain Leaf. Strain it and pour into your bath. The aloe vera plant is a succulent plant species from the genus Aloe. It grows abundantly in tropical climates and has been used for centuries as a medicinal plant. Aloe vera juice is a gooey, thick liquid made from the flesh of the aloe vera plant leaf. It's commonly known to treat sunburns. But drinking this healthy elixir in juice form provides you with a number of other health benefits. The aloe plant is very water-dense, so it's an ideal way to prevent or treat dehydration. Staying hydrated helps your body detox by providing a way for you to purge and flush out impurities. The juice also packs a hefty punch of nutrients that optimize your body's organ output. Drinking aloe vera juice helps increase the water content in your intestines. Research has shown a relationship between increasing the intestinal water content and the stimulation of peristalsis, which helps you pass stool normally. Aloe vera juice is jam-packed with nutrients. Drinking it is an excellent way to make sure you don't become deficient. It contains important vitamins and minerals like vitamins B, C, E, and folic acid. If your digestive system isn't operating optimally, you won't absorb all of the nutrients from the food you're eating. You have to keep your internal engine healthy in order to reap the benefits from your diet. Aloe vera may help decrease irritation in the stomach and intestines. The juice may also help people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other inflammatory disorders of the intestines. One 2013 study of 33 IBS patients found that aloe vera juice helped reduce the pain and discomfort of IBS. The study was not placebo-controlled, so more research is needed. <a href=\"http://J Res syndrome: Trial on patients Hossein Karbasi,2 Mohsen Amini,2 Aghdas Aghaei,2 and Saeed Taheri3 Author information Copyright and License information Disclaimer This article has been cited by other articles in PMC. Sir, Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder of the intestinal tract, which induces abdominal discomfort concomitant with a change in bowel habit including defecation disorders. IBS is a very common disabling disorder, with prevalence of up to 24% in women and 19% in men;[1] moreover, 12% of visits to primary care physicians and 28% of visits to gastroenterologists belongs to patients meeting diagnostic criteria for IBS.[2] Despite all these unfavorable symptoms of the disease, effective therapies are lacking, and herbal agents are usually used for symptom control.

Plants in the Angelica genus grow up to 10 feet (3 meters) tall and have globe-like clusters of green or yellow flowers that blossom into small yellow fruits. They also tend to have a strong, unique smell due to the aromatic compounds they contain. The scent is often described as musky, earthy, or herbaceous (1Trusted Source). A. sinensis is known by a variety of names, including dong quai and female ginseng. It's native to China and other countries in East Asia, where it's used primarily in traditional medicine to treat female hormonal issues. On the other hand, A. archangelica is commonly known as wild celery or Norwegian angelica. This type grows mainly in European countries, where it's used in certain culinary applications or as an herbal medicine. Although the name angelica root implies that just the root is used, most A. archangelica supplements and herbal medicine products contain the root, seeds, fruits, and/or flowers of the plant. A. sinensis products are typically only made with the root of the plant. SUMMARY A. sinensis and A. archangelica are related, but typically only the root of the A. sinensis plant is used in herbal medicine, while the entire A. archangelica plant is used. Overall, there's very little scientific evidence regarding the benefits of angelica root \u2014 neither A. sinensis nor A. archangelica. A. sinensis benefits It's thought that most of the potential benefits of A. sinensis come from ligustilide, a powerful compound that comprises approximately 1% of the plant and provides much of its strong fragrance (1Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source). Anticancer properties In animal and test-tube studies, A. sinensis extract kills glioblastoma cells, which is a form of aggressive brain cancer (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source). However, this does not mean that taking an angelica root supplement can kill brain cancer in humans. In fact, this is unlikely, and much more research in humans is needed before A. sinensis can be considered a potential cancer treatment. Although these findings are a promising starting point for future research, you should follow the advice of your healthcare team if you have cancer. There's also some early evidence that it can specifically promote the healing of diabetic foot wounds. These can be more severe and slower to heal than other wounds due to the blood vessel and tissue damage that high blood sugar levels cause (9Trusted Source). Relief of menopausal hot flashes One of the most common uses of A. sinensis, especially in traditional Chinese medicine, is the management of menopausal symptoms and other female hormonal issues (10Trusted Source). Complementary therapies are also growing in popularity, as more people seek out natural options for menopause symptoms like hot flashes or night sweats (11Trusted Source). Some evidence suggests that decreasing levels of serotonin in the body can contribute to menopausal hot flashes, and angelica root may help maintain or increase circulating levels of serotonin \u2014 thereby reducing the severity and frequency of hot flashes (12Trusted Source). Still, there's very little high quality evidence to support the use of A. sinensis for menopause symptoms, nor any long-term evidence of its safety in menopausal women (13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source). Arthritis relief A. sinensis may provide protection against both osteoarthritis, or joint \"wear and tear,\" as well as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an inflammatory, autoimmune condition of the joints. Supplementing with A. sinensis may decrease inflammation, prevent further joint damage, and promote cartilage repair in osteoarthritis (15Trusted Source). Regarding RA, A. sinensis may decrease the inflammatory response, reducing pain and improving some of its other symptoms (16Trusted Source). However, these studies were conducted in test-tube and animal models, so more research is needed. A. archangelica benefits A. archangelica may also offer some benefits, but little research has been done on this herb. Additionally, most of the existing research was conducted in test-tube and animal studies, which can only serve as promising starting points for future human studies. Anticancer properties In test-tube and animal studies, A. archangelica \u2014 like A. sinensis \u2014 shows some promising anticancer and anti-tumor effects. However, this research is insufficient to prove that A. archangelica can provide anticancer or anti-tumor benefits in humans. More studies are needed. You should follow the treatment plan recommended by your healthcare team if you have cancer. Antimicrobial effects A. archangelica may also kill harmful bacteria, viruses, and fungi. In test-tube studies, A. archangelica essential oil can kill disease-causing bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (20Trusted Source). A. archangelica extract and some isolated compounds from it, including imperatorin, also exhibit antiviral activity against the herpes simplex (cold sore) virus and coxsackievirus, which causes digestive illness (21Trusted Source). A. archangelica essential oil also shows promise as a potential food-safe preservative to inhibit mold growth, as it can kill mold that grows on walnuts (22Trusted Source). Anti-anxiety effects Finally, there's some compelling evidence from animal studies that A. archangelica may help reduce anxiety. However, these studies haven't been replicated in humans, so it's difficult to know whether it'd exert the same effects in people. Human studies are needed. SUMMARY A. sinensis offers potential benefits for wound healing, menopause, and arthritis. A. archangelica may provide anti-anxiety and antimicrobial benefits. Both types can kill certain cancer cells in test-tube studies, but more research in humans is needed. Angelica root, particularly A. sinensis, has known side effects and may cause some drug interactions. While A. archangelica may likewise have some potential side effects, it has not been studied as much as A. sinensis. There have been suspected cases of high dose A. sinensis supplements causing heart problems. A. sinensis may also increase your blood pressure (26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source). A. sinensis may likewise interact with blood thinners like warfarin, possibly causing dangerous and potentially fatal bleeding in certain instances. If you're taking a blood thinner, you should not use A. sinensis without first clearing it with your healthcare provider (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source). Additionally, members of the Angelica genus contain furanocoumarins, which are the same compounds in grapefruit that may interact with many drugs, including certain cholesterol and anti-seizure medications (31Trusted Source). Talk to your healthcare provider before supplementing with any type of Angelica if you're taking prescription medications that carry a grapefruit warning. Furthermore, know that photodermatitis, which is an abnormal skin response to ultraviolet (UV) rays, and contact dermatitis are also a concern when handling the angelica plant (32Trusted Source). Finally, due to a lack of evidence regarding their safety in pregnant and breastfeeding women, you should avoid taking A. archangelica and A. sinensis if you're pregnant, trying to become pregnant, or breastfeeding (33Trusted Source). SUMMARY A. sinensis may increase your blood pressure, cause heart problems, and interact with blood thinners. Additionally, plants in the Angelica genus may interact with drugs that carry a grapefruit warning.

Angelica root supplements are sold in capsule and liquid extract form, as well as dried as a tea. A standard dosage hasn't been established, nor is it clear what a safe dose would be to avoid complications and potential side effects. Most angelica root supplements contain 500-2,000 mg of powdered angelica root or angelica root extract per serving. If you're taking a blood thinner or have preexisting heart problems or high blood pressure, you should avoid A. sinensis unless your healthcare provider has recommended it to you. What's more, avoid self-treating a medical condition with an Angelica-based supplement, as doing so may delay professional care and have serious consequences. Be sure to consult your healthcare professional before considering it for any health purpose. Purchasing angelica root Ensure that the product you purchase contains the type of Angelica that you're looking for and aligns with your desired effects from supplementation. Many supplements called angelica root or angelica don't specify which type they're made with. As a general rule of thumb, dong quai supplements are made with A. sinensis, and angelica root supplements are made with A. archangelica. However, some A. sinensis supplements are also called angelica root. To avoid confusion, only purchase a product that discloses what species of Angelica it contains. SUMMARY A standard dosage hasn't been established. Most angelica root supplements contain 500-2,000 mg of powdered angelica root or angelica root extract per serving. Also, check that the species of Angelica used in the supplement is disclosed on the label. Some people apply carlina directly to the skin for treating skin diseases, rinsing wounds and ulcers, and treating cancer of the tongue. Some carlina preparations are used for herpes outbreaks, pimples, and toothaches. More evidence is needed to rate the effectiveness of carlina for these uses. Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database rates effectiveness based on scientific evidence according to the following scale: Effective, Likely Effective, Possibly Effective, Possibly Ineffective, Likely Ineffective, and Insufficient Evidence to Rate (detailed description of each of the ratings). SIDE EFFECTS There isn't enough information to know if carlina is safe.er Camphor (Cinnamomum camphora) is a terpene (organic compound) that's commonly used in creams, ointments, and lotions. Camphor oil is the oil extracted from the wood of camphor trees and processed by steam distillation. It can be used topically to relieve pain, irritation, and itching. Camphor is also used to relieve chest congestion and inflammatory conditions. Camphor has a wide variety of topical uses due to its antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties. It can be used to treat skin conditions, improve respiratory function, and relieve pain. Continue reading to learn more about the different uses for camphor and its supporting scientific evidence. Camphor for skin Lotions and creams containing camphor can be used to relieve skin irritation and itchiness and may help to improve the overall appearance of skin. It has antibacterial and antifungal properties that make it useful in healing infections. A 2015Trusted Source animal study found camphor to be effective in treating wounds and ultraviolet light-induced wrinkles, making it a potential ingredient in anti-aging cosmetics. This may be due to its ability to increase elastin and collagen production. Use a camphor cream on the area you'd like to treat at least once per day. Relieves pain Applying camphor to the skin helps to relieve pain and inflammation. A small 2015Trusted Source study found that a spray containing natural ingredients such as camphor, menthol, and essential oils of clove and eucalyptus was effective in relieving mild to moderate pain. The spray was applied to the joints, shoulders, and lower back for a period of 14 days. You may feel a tingling, warming, or cooling sensation when you use camphor products. Apply a camphor spray or ointment to the affected area several times per day. Heals burns Camphor balms and creams can be used to heal burn wounds. A 2018Trusted Source animal study found that an ointment containing camphor, sesame oil, and honey decreased the healing time for second-degree burn wounds and was found to be more beneficial than using Vaseline. To use, apply an ointment to the affected area once a day. Treats arthritis Camphor products such as Icy Hot and Biofreeze may be effective in relieving pain, inflammation, and swelling due to arthritis. The hot or cold sensations that arise after application of these creams may distract you from the pain. Camphor has also been shownTrusted Source to have anti-inflammatory effects in animal models that are useful in treating arthritis. To use, apply the camphor cream to any affected areas several times per day. Treats toenail fungus The antifungal properties of camphor make it beneficial in treating toenail fungus. Research from 2011 found that using Vicks VapoRub, which contains camphor as well as menthol and eucalyptus oil, was effective in treating toenail fungus. In the study, 15 of 18 people showed positive results after using the ointment for 48 weeks. To use, apply Vicks VapoRub to the affected toenails a few times per day. To use, place 2 teaspoons of Vicks VapoRub in a bowl of hot water. Hold your head over the bowl and cover your head with a towel as you inhale the vapors. You can also apply the balm to your chest or feet and then cover them with socks. Avoid putting it in or around your nostrils. Antispasmodic Camphor products may also be used as a muscle rub. It may help to relieve muscle cramps, spasms, and stiffness. A 2004 study found that camphor has antispasmodic and relaxant properties. To use, massage a muscle rub such as Bengay onto your sore muscles a few times a day. Other uses Scientific research is limited for some of the purported uses for camphor and the evidence is largely anecdotal. Camphor oil may also be used to treat: Camphor is generally safe for adults when it's used correctly. Lotions or creams containing small amounts of camphor can be applied to your skin. Never use undiluted camphor or products containing more than 11 percent camphor. Always do a skin patch test before using camphor on your skin. Apply a small amount of the camphor product to your inner forearm and wait 24 hours to see if any reaction occurs. Minor side effects such as redness and irritation can occur when using camphor topically. Camphor products should not be used on broken or injured skin because the body could absorb toxic levels. It also can cause respiratory problems such as coughing and wheezing when inhaled. Avoid contact with your eyes. Don't use more than 1 tablespoon of camphor solution per quart of water when using it through steam inhalation. Do not heat products containing camphor, such as Vicks VapoRub or Bengay, in the microwave as they have the potential to explode. Never ignite camphor as it has been shownTrusted Source to cause burns. Note: Camphor should never be ingesting internally as this can cause serious side effects and even death. Signs of camphor toxicity appear within 5 to 90 minutes of ingestion. Symptoms include burning of the mouth and throat, nausea, and vomiting. Taking camphor internally and using it topically is thought to cause liver damage. Don't use camphor if you have any medical conditions affecting your liver. You also shouldn't take camphor if you have asthma or epilepsy. Do not use camphor products if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, as it has the potential to cause birth defects. Children under the age of 2 should not use camphor products at all. Ingesting camphor has been shownTrusted Source to be fatal to toddlers, even in small doses. It can also cause seizuresTrusted Source in children.ADVERTENTIE Most camphor products come in the form of a cream, ointment, or balm that can be applied to your skin. You can find sprays and liquid bath soaks. Some anti-itch and shaving creams contain camphor. Some beauty products like face wash, nail polish, and ChapStick contain camphor. It's also a common ingredient in insect repellents. Manna is a plant. Its dried sap is used to make medicine. People use the dried sap of manna as a laxative for constipation. They also use it as a stool softener to relieve pain during bowel movements caused by cracks around the anus (anal fissures), hemorrhoids, and rectal surgery. You may be familiar with myrrh from Biblical stories even if you're not sure what it is. Myrrh is a reddish-brown dried sap from a thorny tree \u2014 Commiphora myrrha, also known as C. molmol \u2014 that is native to northeastern Africa and southwest Asia (1Trusted Source, 2). A steam distillation process is used to extract myrrh essential oil, which is amber to brown in color and has an earthy scent (3). Myrrh has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic medicine. Scientists are now testing the oil's potential uses, including for pain, infections, and skin sores (4Trusted Source). Here are 11 science-based health benefits and uses of myrrh essential oil. 1. Kills Harmful Bacteria Ancient Egyptians used myrrh and other essential oils to embalm mummies, as the oils not only provide a nice scent but also slow decay. Scientists now know this is because the oils kill bacteria and other microbes (5Trusted Source). Additionally, in Biblical times, myrrh incense \u2014 often in combination with frankincense \u2014 was burned in places of worship to help purify the air and prevent the spread of contagious diseases, including those caused by bacteria. One recent study found that burning myrrh and frankincense incense reduced airborne bacterial counts by 68% (6Trusted Source). Preliminary animal research suggests that myrrh can directly kill bacteria, as well as stimulate the immune system to make more white blood cells, which also kill bacteria (7Trusted Source). In one test-tube study, myrrh oil at a low dilution of 0.1% killed all dormant Lyme disease bacteria, which can persist in some people after antibiotic treatment and continue to cause illness (11Trusted Source). Still, more studies are needed to determine whether myrrh oil can treat persistent Lyme infections. Myrrh oil has been used to kill harmful bacteria long before scientists discovered that microbes cause contagious illnesses. It may have an impact on some drug-resistant and Lyme disease bacteria. Some natural mouthwashes and toothpaste contain myrrh oil, which is approved as a flavoring by the FDA (13Trusted Source, 14). What's more, when people with Behcet's disease \u2014 an inflammatory disorder \u2014 used a myrrh mouthwash to treat painful mouth sores four times daily for a week, 50% of them had complete pain relief and 19% had complete healing of their mouth sores (15). Test-tube studies suggest that mouthwash containing myrrh oil may also help gingivitis, which is inflammation of the gums around your teeth due to a buildup of plaque (12Trusted Source). Yet, more studies are needed to confirm these benefits. Keep in mind that you should never swallow myrrh oral-care products, as high doses of myrrh can be toxic (15). Additionally, if you have oral surgery, it may be best to avoid myrrh mouthwash during healing. A test-tube study found that stitches \u2014 especially silk ones \u2014 can degrade when exposed to myrrh, though they held up in the doses typically found in mouthwash (16Trusted Source). SUMMARYSome natural mouthwashes and toothpastes contain myrrh oil, which may help relieve mouth sores and gum inflammation. Never swallow these products. 3. Supports Skin Health and May Help Heal Sores Traditional uses of myrrh include treating skin wounds and infections. Today, scientists are testing these applications (17Trusted Source). One test-tube study of human skin cells found that an essential oil blend containing myrrh helped heal wounds (18Trusted Source). Another study noted that myrrh and other essential oils applied via baths helped mothers heal skin wounds from vaginal deliveries (19Trusted Source). However, multiple oils were used simultaneously in these studies, so the individual effects of myrrh for wound healing are unclear. Specific studies on myrrh oil are more telling. A test-tube study on 247 different essential oil combinations found that myrrh oil mixed with sandalwood oil was especially effective at killing microbes that infect skin wounds (20Trusted Source). Additionally, in one test-tube study, myrrh oil alone inhibited 43-61% of the growth of five fungi that cause skin conditions, including ringworm and athlete's foot (17Trusted Source). Human research is needed to confirm these benefits. However, if you want to try myrrh for general skin health, many natural ointments and soaps contain it. You can also apply diluted myrrh oil directly on your skin. Applying diluted myrrh oil on your skin may aid wound healing and fight microbes that can cause infections. The oil may also deter the growth of skin fungi, including ringworm and athlete's foot. 4. Combats Pain and Swelling Pain \u2014 such as headaches, joint pain and back pain \u2014 is a common complaint. Myrrh oil contains compounds that interact with opioid receptors and tell your brain you're not in pain. Myrrh also blocks the production of inflammatory chemicals that can lead to swelling and pain (1Trusted Source, 2, 21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source). When people prone to headaches took a multi-ingredient supplement containing myrrh's pain-relieving compounds, their headache pain was reduced by about two-thirds during the six-month study (23). Further research is needed to confirm these benefits. The supplement tested isn't available in the US, and ingesting myrrh oil is not recommended. You can buy myrrh-containing homeopathic rubbing oils and other essential oils meant to relieve pain when applied directly to sore body parts. However, these haven't been studied. Myrrh oil contains plant compounds that may temporarily relieve pain by signaling your brain that you're not in pain. It may also block your body's production of inflammatory chemicals that lead to swelling and pain. 5. May Be a Powerful Antioxidant Myrrh may be a powerful antioxidant, a compound that combats oxidative damage. Oxidative damage from free radicals contributes to aging and some diseases. In a preliminary study, women who failed to respond to standard drug treatment for trichomoniasis were given an oral drug, Mirazid, made of myrrh sap and its essential oil. About 85% of them were cured of the infection (31Trusted Source). Additionally, an animal study found that the same myrrh drug effectively treated giardiasis (32Trusted Source). Some human research suggests that this myrrh drug also may be effective against the parasite Fasciola gigantica, which can cause liver and bile duct diseases. However, other studies failed to see a benefit (33, 34Trusted Source, 35Trusted Source, 36). Mirazid is not widely prescribed at this time. Though more research is needed, myrrh and its oil may prove helpful for treating parasites, especially in cases of drug resistance. Ingesting myrrh oil is not advised, and long-term safety must be assessed (37Trusted Source). SUMMARYPreliminary studies suggest that a myrrh-containing medicine may help treat some common parasites, but more research on its effectiveness and safety is needed.

Other Potential Benefits Scientists are testing other potential uses for myrrh oil and its beneficial compounds. The following applications are under study: Sunscreen: One test-tube study found that SPF 15 sunscreen with added myrrh oil was significantly more effective at blocking ultraviolet rays than the sunscreen alone. By itself, myrrh oil wasn't as effective as the sunscreen (38Trusted Source). Gut health: One animal study indicates that myrrh compounds may help treat intestinal spasms related to irritable bowel syndrome. Another animal study suggests that myrrh may help treat stomach ulcers (42Trusted Source, 43). Mold: Test-tube studies note that myrrh oil may help kill mold, including Aspergillus niger, which commonly appears as mildew on damp walls, and A. flavus, which causes spoilage and mold contamination of food (3, 44). SUMMARYScientists are investigating other potential benefits of myrrh oil, including sunscreen effectiveness, cancer treatment, digestive health, and mold elimination. 11. Simple to Use Myrrh oil can be inhaled, applied topically, or used for oral care. It should not be swallowed. Here are some general guidelines: Topical Use Due to the risk of skin irritation, it's best to dilute myrrh oil in a carrier oil, such as jojoba, almond, grapeseed, or coconut oil. This also helps prevent the myrrh oil from evaporating too quickly (45). In general, use 3-6 drops of essential oil per 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of carrier oil for adults. This is considered a 2-4% dilution. For children, use 1 drop of essential oil per 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of carrier oil, which is a 1% dilution. You can also add a drop or two of myrrh oil to unscented lotion or moisturizer before you apply it to your skin. Some people add myrrh oil to products used for massage. Avoid applying the oil to sensitive areas, including your eyes and inner ears. Wash your hands with soapy water after handling essential oils to avoid accidental exposure to delicate areas. Inhaling You can add 3-4 drops of myrrh oil to a diffuser to distribute the oil as a fine mist into the surrounding air. If you don't have a diffuser, you can simply place a few drops of the oil on a tissue or cloth and inhale periodically or add a few drops to hot water and inhale the steam. One simple trick is to apply a few drops of myrrh oil to the cardboard tube inside a roll of toilet paper. When someone uses it, a bit of the aroma will be released. Combinations The earthy aroma of myrrh oil blends well with spicy, citrus, and floral essential oils, such as frankincense, lemon, and lavender, respectively. The combination of myrrh and frankincense is especially popular \u2014 not only because of their complementary scents but also because of their synergy, or interaction that produces even greater benefits. In test-tube studies, combined myrrh and frankincense oils improved their effectiveness against infectious bacteria and other microbes. About 11% of this improvement was due to synergistic interactions of the oils (46Trusted Source). SUMMARYYou can apply diluted myrrh oil to your skin, diffuse it, or use it orally. The oil can be used alone or in combination with complementary oils, such as frankincense and lemon. Potential Risks Like other essential oils, myrrh oil is very concentrated, so you only need a few drops at a time. Avoid diffusing it close to babies and young children, as it's uncertain how much they'll inhale and how much is safe. Additionally, no one should swallow myrrh oil, as it can be toxic (15). Some people should be especially cautious with myrrh oil and may need to avoid it entirely. Bear this in mind if any of the following conditions apply to you (45, 47Trusted Source): Pregnancy and breastfeeding: Avoid myrrh oil if you're pregnant, as it can cause uterine contractions and may trigger miscarriage. Also avoid myrrh oil if you're breastfeeding, as its safety to your baby isn't known. Blood-thinning drugs: Don't use myrrh if you're taking blood thinners, such as warfarin, as myrrh could decrease their effectiveness. Heart problems: Large amounts of myrrh may affect your heart rate, so use myrrh oil with caution if you have a heart condition. Diabetes: If you're taking diabetes medication, keep in mind that myrrh may lower blood sugar. Therefore, this combination could potentially result in blood sugar that's too low. Surgery: Myrrh may interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Discontinue using myrrh products two weeks before surgery or as advised by your surgeon. SUMMARYIf you're pregnant, have heart problems, are planning surgery, or take blood thinners or diabetes medications, you may want to limit or avoid myrrh oil. The Bottom Line In addition to its pleasant, warm, and earthy scent, myrrh oil may also have several health benefits. Rhubarb is renowned for its sour taste and thick stalks, which are usually cooked with sugar. The stalks range in color from red to pink to pale green and have a consistency that's similar to celery. This vegetable requires cold winters to grow. As a result, it's mainly found in mountainous and temperate regions around the world, especially in Northeast Asia. It's also a common garden plant in North America and Northern Europe. Several varieties and species exist. In the West, the most common variety is called culinary or garden rhubarb (Rheum x hybridum).

One study suggests that its total polyphenol content may be even higher than that of kale (7Trusted Source). The antioxidants in rhubarb include anthocyanins, which are responsible for its red color and thought to provide health benefits. Rhubarb is also high in proanthocyanidins, also known as condensed tannins (8, 9Trusted Source). Additionally, growing evidence suggests this problem is worse for those who lack certain beneficial gut bacteria. Interestingly, some gut bacteria, such as Oxalobacter formigenes, degrade and neutralize dietary oxalates (15Trusted Source, 16Trusted Source). Since it may be high in oxalate, you should avoid eating too much of it and try to select stalks from low-oxalate varieties. If you are prone to kidney stones, it might be best to avoid rhubarb altogether. On the bright side, rhubarb is a good source of antioxidants, vitamin K, and fiber. Saffron contains an impressive variety of plant compounds that act as antioxidants \u2014 molecules that protect your cells against free radicals and oxidative stress. Notable saffron pigments and responsible for saffron's red color. Both compounds may have antidepressant properties, protect brain cells against progressive damage, improve inflammation, reduce appetite, and aid weight loss (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source). Safranal gives saffron its distinct taste and aroma. Research shows that it may help improve your mood, memory, and learning ability, as well as protect your brain cells against oxidative stress (4Trusted Source). Lastly, kaempferol is found in saffron flower petals. This compound has been linked to health benefits, such as reduced inflammation, anticancer properties, and antidepressant activity (2Trusted Source, 5Trusted Source). Summary Saffron is rich in plant compounds that act as antioxidants, such as crocin, crocetin, safranal, and kaempferol. Antioxidants help protect your cells against oxidative stress. 2. May Improve Mood and Treat Depressive Symptoms Saffron is nicknamed the \"sunshine spice.\" That's not just due to its distinct color, but also because it may help brighten your mood. In a review of five studies, saffron supplements were significantly more effective than placebos at treating symptoms of mild-to-moderate depression (6Trusted Source). Other studies found that taking 30 mg of saffron daily was just as effective as Fluoxetine, Imipramine, and Citalopram \u2014 conventional treatments for depression. Additionally, fewer people experienced side effects from saffron compared to other treatments (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source, 9Trusted Source). What's more, both the saffron petals and thread-like stigma appear to be effective against mild-to-moderate depression (1Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source). While these findings are promising, longer human studies with more participants are needed before saffron can be recommended as a treatment for depression. Summary Saffron may help treat symptoms of mild-to-moderate depression,. ADVERTENTIE 3. May Have Cancer-Fighting Properties Saffron is high in antioxidants, which help neutralize harmful free radicals. Free radical damage has been linked to chronic diseases, such as cancer (11Trusted Source). In test-tube studies, saffron and its compounds have been shown to selectively kill colon cancer cells or suppress their growth, while leaving normal cells unharmed (12Trusted Source). This effect also applies to skin, bone marrow, prostate, lung, breast, cervix, and several other cancer cells (13Trusted Source). What's more, test-tube studies have found that crocin \u2014 the main antioxidant in saffron \u2014 may make cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapy drugs (14Trusted Source). While these findings from test-tube studies are promising, the anticancer effects of saffron are poorly studied in humans, and more research is needed. Summary Saffron is high in antioxidants, which may help kill cancer cells while leaving normal cells unharmed. However, more human research is needed. 4. May Reduce PMS Symptoms Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a term that describes physical, emotional, and psychological symptoms occurring before the start of a menstrual period. Studies show that saffron may help treat PMS symptoms. In women 20-45 years of age, taking 30 mg of saffron daily was more effective than a placebo at treating PMS symptoms, such as irritability, headaches, cravings, and pain (15Trusted Source). Another study found that simply smelling saffron for 20 minutes helped reduce PMS symptoms like anxiety and lowered levels of the stress hormone cortisol (16Trusted Source). Summary Both eating and smelling saffron appears to help treat PMS symptoms, such as irritability, headaches, cravings, pain, and anxiety. Aphrodisiacs are foods or supplements that help boost your libido. Studies have shown that saffron may have aphrodisiac properties \u2014 especially in people taking antidepressants. For instance, taking 30 mg of saffron daily over four weeks significantly improved erectile function over a placebo in men with antidepressant-related erectile dysfunction (17Trusted Source). Additionally, an analysis of six studies showed that taking saffron significantly improved erectile function, libido, and overall satisfaction but not semen characteristics (18Trusted Source). In women with low sexual desire due to taking antidepressants, 30 mg of saffron daily over four weeks reduced sex-related pain and increased sexual desire and lubrication, compared to a placebo (19Trusted Source). Summary Saffron may have aphrodisiac properties for both men and women and may especially help those taking antidepressants.

May Reduce Appetite and Aid Weight Loss Snacking is a common habit that may put you at risk of gaining unwanted weight. According to research, saffron may help prevent snacking by curbing your appetite. In one eight-week study, women taking saffron supplements felt significantly more full, snacked less frequently, and lost significantly more weight than women in the placebo group (20Trusted Source). In another eight-week study, taking a saffron extract supplement helped significantly reduce appetite, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and total fat mass (3Trusted Source). However, scientists are unsure how saffron curbs appetite and aids weight loss. One theory is that saffron elevates your mood, which in turn reduces your desire to snack (20Trusted Source). Summary Saffron has been shown to reduce snacking and curb your appetite. In turn, these behaviors may help you lose weight. 7-10. Other Potential Health Benefits Saffron has been linked to other health benefits that have not yet been extensively studied: May reduce heart disease risk factors: Animal and test-tube studies indicate that saffron's antioxidant properties may lower blood cholesterol and prevent blood vessels and arteries from clogging (21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source, 23Trusted Source). May improve eyesight in adults with age-related macular degeneration (AMD): Saffron appears to improve eyesight in adults with AMD and protect against free radical damage, which is linked to AMD (26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source). Summary Saffron has been linked to several other potential health benefits, such as improved heart disease risk, blood sugar levels, eyesight, and memory. However, more studies are needed to draw stronger conclusions. 11. Easy to Add to Your Diet In small doses, saffron has a subtle taste and aroma and pairs well with savory dishes, such as paella, risottos, and other rice dishes. The best way to draw out saffron's unique flavor is to soak the threads in hot \u2014 but not boiling \u2014 water. Add the threads and the liquid to your recipe to achieve a deeper, richer flavor. Saffron is readily available at most specialty markets and can be purchased as threads or in powdered form. However, it's best to buy the threads, as they give you more versatility and are less likely to be adulterated. Though saffron is the most expensive spice in the world, a small amount goes a long way, and you often won't need more than a pinch in your recipes. In fact, using too much saffron can give your recipes an overpowering medicinal taste. In addition, saffron is available in supplement form. Summary Saffron has a subtle taste and aroma, which makes it easy to add to your diet. It pairs well with savory dishes and should be soaked in hot water to give a deeper flavor. Alternatively, you can purchase saffron in supplement form to reap its benefits. Risks, Precautions, and Dosage Saffron is generally safe with little to no side effects. In standard cooking amounts, saffron does not appear to cause adverse effects in humans. As with any supplement, speak to your doctor before taking saffron in supplement form. Another issue with saffron \u2014 especially saffron powder \u2014 is that it may be adulterated with other ingredients, such as beet, red-dyed silk fibers, turmeric, and paprika. Adulteration cuts cost for manufacturers, as real saffron is expensive to harvest (33Trusted Source). Therefore, it's important to purchase saffron from a reputable brand to ensure you get an authentic product. If the saffron appears too cheap, its best to avoid it. In normal doses, saffron is generally safe with little to no side effects. Make sure to purchase saffron from a reputable brand or store to avoid an adulterated product. It has been linked to health benefits, such as improved mood, libido, and sexual function, as well as reduced PMS symptoms and enhanced weight loss. Best of all, it's generally safe for most people and easy to add to your diet. Try incorporating saffron into your favorite dishes to take advantage of its potential health benefits or purchase a supplement online. The primary active compounds in senna leaves are known as senna glycosides, or sennosides. Sennosides cannot be absorbed in your digestive tract, but they can be broken down by your gut bacteria (1Trusted Source). This breakdown of sennosides mildly irritates the cells in your colon, an effect that stimulates intestinal movement and produces a laxative effect. Senna is an active ingredient in many popular over-the-counter laxative medications, such as Ex-Lax and Nature's Remedy. For most people, it will stimulate a bowel movement within 6-12 hours (2). Some people may also use senna tea to relieve discomfort associated with hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids are swollen veins and tissues in the lower rectum that can cause bleeding, pain, and itching. Chronic constipation is a major cause, and minor bouts of constipation can irritate preexisting hemorrhoids (4Trusted Source). However, senna's efficacy for relieving hemorrhoid symptoms has not been thoroughly studied.SUMMARY Senna is primarily used to alleviate constipation, but some people may also use it to prepare for colonoscopies and manage hemorrhoid symptoms. We'll send you the latest on using herbs, supplements, yoga, and more to help you manage your health with natural remedies.Enter your emailSIGN UP Your privacy is important to us. Any information you provide to us via this website may be placed by us on servers located in countries outside of the EU. If you do not agree to such placement, do not provide the information. Senna tea is often described as having a mild, sweet, and slightly bitter flavor. Unlike many other herbal teas, it isn't particularly aromatic on its own. However, many commercial teas combine senna with other herbs that can alter the final aroma and flavor. If you're using tea bags or a blend, follow the package instructions. While some people claim that it promotes weight loss, you shouldn't use it in any weight loss detox or cleanse.
