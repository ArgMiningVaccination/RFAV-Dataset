Munson Medical Center, Paul Oliver Memorial Hospital, and Kalkaska Memorial Health Center have been working with a regional collaboration known as MiThrive to complete a regional assessment of needs in northern Michigan communities. Our goal is to pin-point the most pressing health issues in our communities and determine what more can be done to improve the health of the people we serve. The full regional assessment encompassed 31 counties, and more than 150 organizations participated in some aspect of the Community Health Needs Assessment process. This report focuses on the needs of Antrim, Benzie, Grand Traverse, Kalkaska, and Leelanau counties. These counties are considered our \"community\" because more than 67 percent of the Munson Medical Center (MMC) inpatient population resides within this area. These counties also are part of the Paul Oliver Memorial Hospital (POMH) and Kalkaska Memorial Health Center (KMHC) service areas. Data was collected in the following ways: compiling existing statistics; hearing from residents; learning from groups of community organizations; and surveying health care providers and community members. We then identified two major priorities for our region: mental health/substance abuse and basic needs of living. Additionally, we identified three other strategic issues and two significant goals for our planning process. These additional strategic issues include: access to health care, sense of community, and risks for leading causes of death. The goals for the planning process include cross- sector collaboration and community representation. This 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA), which was adopted by the Board of Trustees on May 22, 2019, incorporates requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. 4 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | Munson Medical CenterIntroduction Our Commitment to Community Health Many factors combine to determine the health of a community. In addition to disease, community health is affected by substance abuse, education level, economic status, environmental issues, and the personal choices of all of us who live, work, and play in the community. No one individual, community group, hospital, agency, or governmental body can entirely be responsible for the health of the community. No organization can address the multitude of issues alone. However, working together, we can understand the issues and create a plan to address them. MiThrive Partnership Our continued commitment to our mission of working together with our partners to provide superior quality care and promote community health is reflected in our Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA), as well as in the work we do each day to better understand and address the health needs of our community. For the 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment, this commitment is evident in our participation in MiThrive, a regional, collaborative project designed to bring together dozens of organizations across 31 counties of northern Michigan to identify local needs and work together to improve our communities. Where we live, learn, work, and play powerfully influences our health. Improving community health requires a broad focus and coordination among diverse agencies and stakeholders. The goal is to continue to build new partnerships and gather input from more organizations and residents. Our CHNA represents a collaborative, community-based approach to identify, assess, and prioritize the most important health issues affecting our community, giving special attention to the poor and underserved in our service area. The process is also the foundation that we will use to collaboratively plan, develop, and foster programs to effectively address those needs in our community. Understanding Health Equity As the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation describes it, \"Health equity means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible. This requires removing obstacles to health such as poverty, discrimination, and their consequences, including powerlessness and lack of access to good jobs with fair pay, quality education and housing, safe environments, and health care. For the purposes of measurement, health equity means reducing and ultimately eliminating disparities in health and its determinants that adversely affect excluded or marginalized groups.\" One way to examine the importance of focusing on health equity is to look at how life expectancy varies by community. Even in neighboring census tracts, the difference in life expectancy can be 10 years or more. This is a sign that further investigation is needed to understand the root causes driving the disparity - especially the differences in the conditions where people in these communities live, work, worship, and play. In the 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment Findings, we examine the impact of these issues on health and health equity, the extent of the challenge in our counties, and opportunities to improve them. Additional data tables related to these issues can be found in Appendix B. 5 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | Munson Medical CenterEvaluation of Impact Since 2016 CHNA Significant Health Need: Overweight/Obesity Help our community achieve and maintain a healthy weight Written Comments Comments regarding the 2016 CHNA and Implementation Strategy were received via email regarding the topics of health coaching and financial assistance. These comments echoed some of the data received via other data collection methods. Actions and impact since preceding CHNA and Implementation Strategy: Continue to be the backbone organization for Shape Up North Munson Medical Center supports this initiative through staffing and marketing. Munson Medical Center has launched a Shape Up North website to provide our community with access to available resources for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. Also, increased social media efforts have grown the Shape Up North Facebook page to 1,165 followers. Seek opportunities to work with other community partners interested in this topic to collectively make a difference in this area The number of partners engaged in Shape Up North has tripled to include 65. Partners include numerous community organizations; the focus is on impacting schools, worksites, physicians, and the community. Munson Medical Center team members actively participate in the northern Michigan Community Health Innovation Region's (CHIR) efforts to help our community achieve a healthy weight. Launch of a \"What Makes Me Healthy\" campaign through Shape Up North to encourage and inspire our community to be active and eat healthy This campaign features stories published on the Shape Up North website. Beyond the \"What Makes Me Healthy\" Campaign, Munson Medical Center has shifted work to enhance efforts to connect people to healthy recipes and exercise opportunities. Inspiring healthy living through the sharing of local success stories also is part of these efforts. Continue the Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program A total of 802 participants enrolled in this program. Funding has been secured to continue the program through 2020. Continue the Diabetes Prevention Program which encourages weight loss and physical activity A total of 119 participants enrolled in the Munson Medical Center program. The program will continue to be offered to our community. Continue the employee wellness program for MMC employees An Employee Wellness Coordinator was hired and several efforts have been initiated to provide opportunities for health and wellness among Munson Medical Center employees. These include several sports clubs, Winter Walk Wednesdays, Weight Watchers at Work, and Core 4 weight loss program. Significant Health Need: Diabetes Reduce the prevalence of diabetes and improve care of people living with diabetes Actions and impact since preceding CHNA and Implementation Strategy: Recruit eligible participants for Diabetes Prevention Program groups Munson Medical Center continues to promote and recruit individuals with prediabetes identified through the diabetes education service at Munson Medical Center and Munson Family Practice. Munson Medical Center has continued to offer the program at a minimum of two times per year. A total of 119 participants enrolled in the Munson Medical Center program. The program will continue to be offered to our community. Continue to serve as the coordinating organization of the regional Northern Michigan Diabetes Initiative (NMDI) Munson Medical Center supports this initiative through staffing and community awareness efforts. Munson Medical Center has made improvements to the Northern Michigan Diabetes Initiative website to provide our community with access to available resources for diabetes prevention and management. Also, social media awareness efforts have grown the Northern Michigan Diabetes Initiative Facebook page to 361 followers. Northern Michigan Diabetes Initiative currently has 20 unique organizations represented on its steering committee, which meets quarterly to work on efforts related to management and prevention of diabetes. Promote and provide evidence-based practice education relating to diabetes to our health care providers Northern Michigan Diabetes Initiative has partnered with the Michigan Care Management Resource Center to produce webinars tailored to care managers. There have been four in the past few years with a total of 346 in- person and remote attendees.6 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | Munson Medical Center Offer educational opportunities related to diabetes throughout our community The Munson Medical Center Community Health Library provides free educational offerings to our community throughout the year. Assist partners with implementation of the Diabetes Prevention Program within their region The Community Health Coordinator has served as a co-lead for the Northern Michigan Diabetes Prevention Program Collaborative. The Community Health Coordinator also has provided support to newer programs within Munson Healthcare. The collaborative is working on shared marketing tools. Promote the Diabetes Prevention Program to primary care provider offices The referral for this program was integrated into the Munson Healthcare Diabetes Education Referral form. The Diabetes Prevention Program has been written about in health care provider newsletters. Efforts are in place to conduct targeted outreach to provider practices. Flyers have been disseminated to primary care provider offices in Cadillac, Grayling, Kalkaska, Manistee, and Otsego. Significant Health Need: Substance Abuse, Tobacco Use, and Mental Health Improve access to mental health and substance use disorder services throughout our communities Actions and impact since preceding CHNA and Implementation Strategy: Work together with interested partners on the development and implementation of a plan to increase access to mental health and substance use disorder services Munson Medical Center continues to work with Pine Rest Behavioral Health Solutions on improving access to services and improving our revenue cycle to support more services. Volumes have increased: -Outpatient Behavioral Health - up 1.3% compared to budget in FY 2019 and up 356 visits compared to YTD FY 2018. -Inpatient Behavioral Health - current average daily census 15.8 compared to 14.6 last year -Partial Hospital Program - no growth in census Implementation of open access in Outpatient Behavioral Health, which allows people real-time access to a behavioral health assessment two days per week, without waiting for a scheduled appointment. An outpatient psychiatrist was added in October 2018. A new consultation-liaison psychiatrist was hired August 2018. Regarding psychiatric services capacity, Munson Medical Center has recruited six psychiatrists and three psychiatric advance practice professionals. The Munson Medical Center Director of Behavioral Health is currently working with a behavioral health community task force sponsored by the Grand Traverse Regional Community Foundation to increase and improve access to behavioral health services in our community. Munson Medical Center Outpatient Behavioral Health was awarded a $1.5 million three-year grant for Opioid Use Disorder Treatment. Services have started under this grant. Two MedSafe bins have been added for the community to drop off and disposal of medications free of charge. Work with performance services to measure increases in volumes and acuity to define staffing need and present to Staffing Review Committee Progress has been made with performance services in defining our critical units and measuring services. We have had approval on additional staffing needs and are working to ensure accuracy of staffing data and units for the OPTIX system - a tool to assist with staffing adjustments. We have tracked the visit count at the emergency department with primary mental health or substance use diagnoses, emergency department recidivism for those with primary mental health or substance use diagnoses within one year, and emergency department patients who have received a behavioral health specialist consult. Combine with Integrated health care team and tele-health initiatives to increase access to mental health and substance use disorder services Munson Medical Center is participating in a pilot program with Pine Rest Christian Mental Health Services for pediatric psychiatric consultation in the emergency department. Currently looking at telehealth models to apply across Munson Healthcare. Psychiatric providers are supportive of telehealth. Behavioral Management Associates have signed a contract with Munson Medical Center Family Practice to facilitate provider consultation regarding their patients' psychiatric health concerns.7 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | Munson Medical CenterSignificant Health Need: Access to Health Services Provide services that reach medically underserved areas and population groups throughout our community Actions and impact since preceding CHNA and Implementation Strategy: Strengthen telemedicine resources Munson Medical Center received a USDA/RUS (Rural Utility Services) Telehealth Grant. Through this grant we were able to do the following: -We have increased our capacity to connect clinicians and patients at remote sites by adding the hardware needed to support live, interactive videoconferencing. -We have purchased 17 telemedicine carts and distributed them to rural hospitals and clinics to support telehealth and telemedicine in our rural communities. -We have partnered with Grand Valley State University, Traverse City campus, working to fill gaps in the current health care workforce in our rural communities by recruiting students from local communities to the physician assistant program, placing them in rural clinical rotations, and training them to utilize telemedicine equipment and practices in our rural clinics and facilities. -We have purchased equipment needed to record Community Health Library classes and programs as to share with other locations and at later dates. Munson Healthcare leads a telehealth strategy group to discuss telehealth initiatives throughout the Munson Healthcare system. Physician recruitment for medically underserved areas/ populations Munson Medical Center recruits for needed specialties throughout our community. Based on the community need, the number of physicians recruited for needed specialties were seven in fiscal year 2017 and nine in fiscal year 2018. Provide HealthLink service to connect patients with services Munson Healthcare offers the HealthLink service to help connect patients to the medical care they need. Total annual HealthLink transactions have grown 30% since the preceding CHNA. Provide services to uninsured and underinsured through the Munson Family Practice Residency Program and Clinic Munson Family Practice is serving patients who are both uninsured and underinsured. Visits have ranged from 663 - 976 annually for those who are uninsured and 17,255- 22,163 for those with Medicaid. Munson Family Practice has added a nurse care manager and a care coordinator to help patients identify and get connected with resources they need. Munson Family Practice also has added a pharmacist to its team. The pharmacist is available to meet with patients to discuss medication. Munson Family Practice has a social worker on site 1 \u00bd days a week to see patients up to the age of 26 at no cost to the patient. Provide financial assistance to qualifying patients Munson Medical Center provided $687,000 of financial assistance to our patients in fiscal year 2017. Provide Munson's Medication Assistance Program to those in need/Provide charity medication donations Munson Medical Center has continued to provide to the Medication Assistance Program as well as other charity medication donations with the dollar amount just over $182,000 in fiscal year 2017 and $265,000 in fiscal year 2018. Continue to be a participant in the Grand Traverse Region Oral Health Coalition Munson Medical Center Community Health participated in Grand Traverse Region Oral Health Coalition meetings. Significant Health Need: Maternal, Fetal and Infant Health Improve birth outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, and infant mortality rate in our community Actions and impact since preceding CHNA and Implementation Strategy: Provide education, support, and connection to resources to families through the Healthy Futures program. Munson Medical Center continues to collaborate with area health departments to offer the Healthy Futures program. In fiscal year 2017, the number of women served through the Healthy Futures program was 7,444; in fiscal year 2018, the program served 7,658. Encourage breastfeeding and immunizations through the Healthy Futures program The percent of mothers receiving Healthy Futures who are breastfeeding at two months postpartum has ranged from 68 - 72% from fiscal years 2016 to 2018. The percent of infants enrolled in the Healthy Futures program with up-to-date immunizations has ranged from 81 - 83% from fiscal years 2016 to 2018.8 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | Munson Medical Center Improve connectivity with Healthy Futures participants by leveraging technology We developed a new website - healthyfuturesonline.org - with significant enhancements. These include: -A regional resource directory -Supportive educational videos -Informational articles -Intentional engagement opportunities to enroll in the program, connect to a provider, and schedule a home visit or class We created an electronic enrollment portal so families can enter the required information and consent to Healthy Futures easily and conveniently. We created a social media presence via Facebook and Instagram. We implemented text communication, driving participants to helpful websites and newsletter articles. Provide tools for provider offices to use when working with mothers who smoke First trimester prenatal care in this region is suboptimal and one strategy proposed is when women call to make their first prenatal visit, the OB provider office also makes a warm handoff to Healthy Futures. This creates an opportunity to deliver early education and to offer a connection to resources while women await their first prenatal OB appointment. This creates access to health care and resources provided by the public health department, including Medicaid, WIC, home visiting, transportation, basic needs, etc. in the interim before their first prenatal provider appointment. Provide regular data updates on maternal smoking rates to provider offices This element was not implemented due to the development of the new database and unanticipated delays in the integration between existing data sources, such as the State of Michigan Electronic Birth Certificate system, and the new operating system. Significant Health Need: Access to Healthy Foods Improve the affordability and utilization of healthy food among the underserved population in our community Actions and impact since preceding CHNA and Implementation Strategy: Expand the Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program to additional partners in the Munson Medical Center service region The Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program has been expanded beyond Traverse City to Benzie County. This expansion added almost 200 more participants. Efforts are focused on further expansion to the Cadillac market. Be available as a resource for others who want to implement the Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program Munson Medical Center assisted markets in Benzie County to successfully initiate the program. Through this broader reach we were able to serve more than double the participants. We are currently working with Munson Healthcare Cadillac Hospital to initiate a new program. We also are working with the Michigan Farmers Market Association as they collect data on programs taking place throughout Michigan. Offer sessions at farm markets open to all community members on how to use and cook fresh produce On average, 80 classes have been offered per market season which include education from a chef and dietitian, on how to use and cook with fresh produce. Continue to offer MyWellness meals at the Munson Medical Center cafeteria The MyWellness meals have continued and the options have expanded to include more variety. The MyWellness meals sold have more than tripled to 77,491, likely due to this expansion. Continue to provide the opportunity to Munson Medical Center employees to participate in Community Supported Agriculture shares The Community Supported Agriculture shares have been continued as to provide easy access to fresh and local produce to employees with an average of 78 shares sold each year.9 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | Munson Medical CenterCommunity Health Needs Assessment We used the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partner - ships (MAPP) framework to guide the Community Health Needs Assessment process. MAPP , developed by the National Association for County & City Health Officials and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is considered the \"gold standard\" for community health assessment and improvement planning. MAPP is a community-driven planning tool that applies strategic thinking to priority issues and identifies resources to address them. The Community Health Assessment portion of the MAPP process includes four phases. Phase One: Organize for Success In spring 2018, we began the process of bringing partners togeth - er to lay the foundations of the MiThrive project. We organized a steering committee with representation from local hospitals, local health departments, federally-qualified health centers, Community Mental Health, and the Area Agency on Aging. From the begin - ning, we laid plans for reaching out to new partners in other sectors to join MiThrive. Phase Two: Visioning The steering committee together set the vision of the project for the community: A vibrant, diverse, and caring community in which regional collaboration allows all people the ability to achieve optimum physical, mental, cultural, social, spiritual, and economic health and well-being. Phase Three: The Assessments Community Themes and Strengths Assessment This assessment gathered input (mostly qualitative) from community members to find out how they perceive their quality of life, see assets and problems in their communities, and define what is important to them. Community Input Boards The purpose of the Community Input Boards was to gather feedback from the general public on how their community context impacts health. At large community events, community members answered two questions by writing their answer on a sticky note and sticking it to the question board. These are the questions we asked: 1. What in your community helps you live a healthy life? 2. What can be done in your community to improve health and quality of life? We collected data using Community Input Boards from July- October 2018.Mini Client Interviews The purpose of the Mini Client Interviews was to gather input from specific vulnerable populations by partnering with organizations that specialize in working with these populations. Our questions focused on barriers to accessing health care: 1. In the past year, what challenges have you or your family had trying to get health care you needed? 2. What kind of health care did you have trouble getting? 3. What would make it easier to get care? Community Health Status Assessment The purpose of this assessment was to collect quantitative, secondary data about the health, wellness, and social determinants of health of all residents in our service area. This involved gathering statistics from sources like the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, County Health Rankings, the Census Bureau, and other established sources. Local Community Health System Assessment The purpose of this assessment was to gather input from organizations serving the community, and get a system perspective on work being done in the community. Facilitators guided discussions at Human Services Coordinating Bodies and other groups. Discussions focused on different aspects of how all community organizations and entities work together as a unified system to serve the communities. We organized notes by looking How we sought input from medically under - served, minority, and low-income populations? Through Mini Client interviews, we reached out to medically underserved and low-income populations to learn about barriers they face accessing care. Community Input Boards were part of events serving low-income populations. We sought input from minority populations through inviting representatives from local tribes and other organizations serving minorities to participate in steering committee meetings, the Forces of Change Assessment, and prioritization. We surveyed health care providers who serve Medicaid patients. Organizations representing medically underserved and low-income populations participated in the Local Community Health System Assessment, the Forces of Change Assessment, and the prioritization process.10 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment Opportunities,\" \"System Weaknesses,\" and \"System Strengths.\" Forces of Change Assessment The purpose of this assessment was to identify forces - trends, factors, and events - that are influencing or likely will influence the health and quality of life of the community or that impact the work of the local community health system in northern Michigan. This assessment provides critical information about the larger context influencing the potential success of the strategies we develop. This assessment was done through four cross-sector events, in Traverse City (2), West Branch, and Big Rapids. The discussion focused on seven types of forces affecting the community: economic, environmental, ethical, social/cultural, tech/science/education, political/legislative, and scientific. After identifying forces at work, we looked at threats and opportunities presented by these forces. The first three Forces of Change events focused broadly on any issues affecting the community. After \"Aging Population\" was identified at all three events as one of the most powerful forces in our northern Michigan communities, we added a fourth event focused specifically on how these seven types of forces intersect with issues around a growing aging population. Phase Four: Identify and Prioritize Strategic Issues Through a facilitated process supported by the Michigan Public Health Institute, we reviewed all the key findings from the four assessments and looked for the underlying challenges that are preventing us from achieving our shared vision. Regular attendees of MiThrive Steering Committee attended meetings, as well as additional interested MiThrive partners (a full list is provided in Appendix A). Through combining the data from the four assessments and looking at the community from a holistic perspective, we identified the seven strategic issues described in this report, two of which were categorized to be used for our next step of developing the Community Health Improvement Plan, leaving five strategic issues. Next, we prioritized these issues to decide which two strategic issues we would focus on for our collaborative Community Health Improvement Plan. We began by getting input from the community and health care providers through surveys. The surveys were designed around the identified strategic issues, and asked questions designed to inform the prioritization process. Community members were asked questions related to urgency, importance, commitment, and impact on the quality of life for their families and communities. Providers similarly were asked questions about their perspective on these issues' urgency, importance, and impact on quality of life for their patients, as well as whether they had resources available to address the issues and whether they already were working to address them. Community surveys mainly were distributed online through the hospitals and partner organizations, primarily through posting on organization websites and through social media. Paper surveys were available in some places. Health care provider surveys were distributed through all the major northern Michigan hospital systems to their affiliated providers. (The results of these surveys are included in the Appendix C.) Next, we held a meeting to look at needs and conditions across the entire 31-county northern Michigan region. The meeting used a facilitated process, guided by an evidence-based prioritization matrix to ensure our decisions were data-driven and objective. The criteria considered through the prioritization matrix included Community Values, Severity, Magnitude, Impact of Intervention, Achievability, and Sustainability. The data we used included all the information we gathered previously, including statistics, input from community and partner organizations, and results from the surveys. Through this facilitated process, we collaboratively identified a top issue to approach collectively on a large regional scale. We then held meetings around Northern Michigan to identify additional priorities for smaller groups of counties, based on local data, conditions, and experience. A standardized process was used at each meeting. This process included a prioritization matrix with the criteria of magnitude, severity, values, impact, achievability, and sustainability to rank the strategic issues. Organizations invited to participate in each meeting included those with special knowledge and expertise in public health, local public health departments, and organizations representing medically underserved, low income, and minority groups.11 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | Munson Medical Center2019 Community Needs Health Assessment Findings Hospital and Communities Served Munson Medical Center Located in Traverse City, Michigan, MMC is the largest hospital in northern Lower Michigan with 442 licensed acute care beds. It has a national reputation for quality, and has been named a Top 100 Hospital 14 times. Munson Medical Center is designated as a Rural Referral Center by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and is also recognized by CMS as a Sole Communi - ty Hospital. Because of this status, it is equipped to provide critical care to patients from 24 counties in northern lower Michigan and the eastern Upper Peninsula. More than 540,000 people served by MMC reside across 11,000 square miles. MMC's primary service area is composed of five counties: Antrim, Benzie, Grand Traverse, Kalkaska, and Leelanau. These five counties are considered the community served by the hospital because nearly 67 percent of the MMC inpatient population lives in the primary service area. The only verified Level II Trauma Center north of Grand Rapids, MI The only Level 3 Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in northern Michigan A robust teaching hospital for residents, interns, medical students, and nursing students Nationally recognized for cardiac care; advanced oncology services in a state-of-the-art cancer center, and a stellar orthopedics program A Primary Stroke Center A Magnet hospital for nursing excellence - among only 2 percent of hospitals in the world to achieve Magnet status three times Involved in national heart and cancer research programs The 5-county Grand Traverse region is a four season destina - tion for outdoor enthusiasts, with abundant natural beauty and recreational resources. The region is nationally known for fruit and wine production, a growing microbrew and spirits industry, and a vibrant art community. The region is often included on \"top lists\" for places to retire, vacation, pursue outdoor sports, etc. Regional Population Demographics Geography and Population Antrim, Benzie, Grand Traverse, Kalkaska, and Leelanau counties cover a total of 2,166 square miles of land. The region is classified as \"rural\" by the US Census Bureau with Traverse City defined as a micropolitan area. In general, rural locations experience signif - icant health disparities, such as higher incidence of disease and disability, increased mortality rates and lower life expectancy. Rural residents are more likely to have a number of chronic conditions and are less likely to receive recommended preventive services, in part due to lack of access to physicians and health care delivery sites and/or adequate transportation options. Of the 171,828 people who live in the 5-county region, over half (92,084) live in Grand Traverse County. The population of the region is predominantly white (93%); Hispanic/Latinos, at 2.7%, and Native Americans, at 1.6%, are the largest minority groups. The proportion of adults over 65 years old is considerably larger in the region (22%) than the State (16%). In addition, the proportion of older adults is expected to continue increasing across northern Michigan at a much faster rate than the state average. Education and Income Education, employment, and health are intricately linked. Without a good education, prospects for a stable and rewarding job with good earnings decrease. Education is associated with living longer, experiencing better health, practicing health promoting behaviors such as exercising regularly, refraining from smoking, and obtain - ing timely health checkups and screenings. Overall, educational attainment is higher in the 5-county area (30% of the population age 25+ has earned a Bachelor's degree) than the State (27%). However, rates vary widely among the five counties, ranging from 14% in Kalkaska County to over 40% in Leelanau county. Median household income in Michigan is $52,668. Antrim and Kalkaska counties are below the state average; Grand Traverse, Benzie, and Leelanau counties are above. However, within these counties, stark income inequality exists. Leelanau County has the most drastic income inequality in the state: the average income of the top 1% of earners is 32 times the average income of all other earners in the county.Working Partnerships As a tertiary hospital, Munson Medical Center maintains excellent collaborative partnerships, allowing community members to receive highly specialized, advanced services close to home: Helen DeVos Children's Hospital, Grand Rapids, MI. Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Center, Grand Rapids, MI. Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor, MI. Michigan State University, Lansing, MI.12 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | Munson Medical Center2019 Strategic Priorities and Issues This year we identified strategic priorities as part of the MiThrive collaborative. Strategic issues are broader than individual health conditions and represent underlying challenges that need to be addressed, which would lead to improvement in health conditions. Each strategic issue should impact more than one health condition. Strategic Priority: Ensure a community that provides preventive and accessible mental health and substance abuse services Health Impact Mental illness and substance use disorders can have grave impacts on length and quality of life for individuals, as well as significantly impact families and communities. For individuals, mental illness and substance use disorders can disrupt every area of life, including relationships, work, health, and other areas. Individuals facing these conditions are at higher risk for a number of physical illnesses and have an increased risk of premature death. For families, mental illness and substance use disorders can disrupt family ties and social connections, make it more difficult to meet basic needs, and create additional stress for family members. For communities, mental illness and substance use disorders can disrupt community cohesion, present extra burdens on law enforcement, and create risks for the community like drunk driving and second-hand smoke. Healthy Equity Disparities in mental health and substance use disorders treatment persist in diverse segments of the population, including: racial and ethnic groups; lesbian, gay, bisexual, populations; people with disabilities; transition- age youth; and young adults. In addition, certain segments of the population - individuals facing poverty, childhood trauma, domestic violence, and foster care - have historically had less access to services, low utilization of services, and even poorer behavioral health outcomes. Provider shortages, lack of inpatient treatment beds, and limited culturally competent services all contribute to persistent disparities in mental health and substance use treatment, especially in rural areas. Rural areas also 2019 Strategic Priorities Ensure a community that provides preventative and accessible mental health and substance abuse services Address basic needs of living to create resiliency and promote equity Additional Issues Improve access to comprehensive health care for all Foster a sense of community that promotes trust and inclusiveness Improve prevention and reduce health risks for leading causes of death How do we ensure a community that provides preventative and accessible mental health and substance abuse services?Mental Health Provider Shortages Integration of physical/ mental substance use services Anxiety, Depression Severe Mental IllnessSuicide OpioidsTobaccoVapingAlcoholMarijuana13 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | Munson Medical Centerhave been the hardest hit by growing rates of opioid abuse and overdose. In addition, as our population of older adults continues to grow, so do the distinct risks and needs for that population. Challenges With suicide rates above the national average and 30-40% of teens reporting symptoms of a major depressive episode in the past year, mental health is a significant concern in the Grand Traverse Region. Similarly, abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs need to be addressed. Rates of binge drinking range from 16% (Leelanau) to 23% (Grand Traverse), and 1 in 5 residents of the Grand Traverse region smokes - including during pregnancy. Hepatitis C rates, which are strongly associated with injection drug use, are spiking among young adults. Among teens, 3 in 10 report vaping in the past month, and nearly 2 in 10 used marijuana in the past month. Contributing to these problems are ongoing shortages of mental health providers and substance use treatment options. Assets, Resources, and Opportunities With the rising severity of these issues, more organizations and coalitions are working on Mental Health/Substance Use than ever before. Some examples of these efforts include Grand Traverse County Drug-Free Coalition; Northern Michigan Opioid Response Consortium; MDHHS Adolescent Centers; Local Health Departments; Community Connections program through the Community Health Innovation Region. With increased coordination among groups, the potential for significant impact is growing. Prioritization Organizations participating in MiThrive saw this issue as an important area to address through the project at both local and regional levels. To significantly improve access to treatment, system changes are needed on a regional and statewide scale, and MiThrive will provide a platform for more effectively advocating for these changes. In addition, many more groups are working on these issues now than have been in the past, so this is an ideal time to begin to bridge efforts and promote collaboration. Looking at criteria including values, severity, impact, and magnitude, mental health/substance use scores as a high priority. Mental illness and substance use issues are growing quickly, and all segments of the population are affected. The burden falls most heavily, however, on the most vulnerable populations, making these issues important to address to achieve health equity. For those facing these issues, the impact on health and quality of life can be severe. Improving prevention and access to care for mental health and substance use is highly valued by the community: 92% of residents agreed in a survey that it is important to meet the basic mental health needs of people in our community. For these reasons, mental health and substance use was identified as a top priority in the Grand Traverse region, as well as the full 31-county MiThrive region. Community Voice Residents said when it came to supporting their health, they want better: Access to mental health providers Access to substance use treatment Response to the opioid crisis and other drugs Anti-tobacco policies Response to drunk driving When surveyed, residents ranked this issue as the second most urgent of all the strategic issue identified. Almost 90% of resident survey respondents agreed that many people in their community need better access to mental health and substance abuse services/prevention. \"[We need] education of judicial system/law enforcement on mental illness and how to better support families of mentally ill individuals.\" - Grand Traverse County resident \"Too many in our community are suffering and dying from a lack of services. Mental health illnesses are more likely to impact peo - ple across the lifespan than any other disease. Please help.\" - Grand Traverse County resident \"A member of my family needs mental health services which are difficult to access due to transportation and financial limitations, as well as a shortage of psychiatrists in our region.\" - Benzie County resident Community Organizations cited the following as significant, growing threats in northern Michigan: Legalization of marijuana Opioid crisis/drugs/vaping Mental illness14 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | Munson Medical CenterStrategic Priority: Address basic needs of living to create resiliency and promote equity Health Impact Addressing basic needs of living is crucial to improving the conditions in the environments in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age. Conditions in the physical and socioeconomic environment have a vital impact on a wide range of health, function, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks. A few examples of how these basic needs are linked to important health outcomes: Nutrition education can lead to improved diet and weight for families in food secure households. Living in housing with physical problems (e.g. need for appliance, roof, and heating updates) is associated with poor self-assessed health, increased limitations to activities for daily living, and chronic disease. Faulty appliances and inadequate heating may increase nitrogen dioxide. Plumbing leaks, roof leaks, and inadequate ventilation increases mold, which are associated with higher rates of asthma. Communities and housing not designed for senior accessibility can increase risk of falls, social isolation, loss of independence, and many other problems. Physical activity levels increase in neighborhoods with safe sidewalks and streetlights, leading to safer neighborhoods with less crime, therefore reducing the risk of obesity. Healthy Equity These kinds of basic needs are the root cause of many serious inequities in health outcomes. Needs like food insecurity and inadequate housing affect low-income and vulnerable residents the most, disproportionately putting them at high risk of many poor health outcomes. Improving these root-causes would make a much longer-term impact on health equity than program interventions like health education classes. Similarly, seniors are disproportionately harmed by these issues. Creating communities that are safe and healthy for seniors improves conditions for other populations as well. Challenges In Antrim and Kalkaska Counties, more than 2 in 5 households struggle to afford basic household necessities. The percentage of children living in households below the poverty level ranges from 12% in Grand Traverse County to 24% in Kalkaska County. In the 5-county region, 1 in 7 kids did not have consistent access to enough food over the past year. More than a third of all home renters in the 5-county region spend 35% or more of their household income on rent, putting them at higher risk of housing insecurity and homelessness. All these factors weaken the ability of families and communities to endure challenges and develop healthy, thriving lives. Assets, Resources, and Opportunities Many organizations in the area are addressing basic needs of living. These issues are complex and multi-dimensional, so as new collaborations form and expand, the possible total impact on basic needs grows. The Northern Michigan Community Health Innovation Region is a significant example: over 90 organizations in 10 counties of Northwest Michigan have come together to address issues related to food access, transportation, affordable housing, and opportunities for active living. Some additional examples of current work in this area include the Youth Homelessness Demonstration Project, Northwest Coalition to End Homelessness, the local food coalition, and the Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program through Shape Up North. With new community-wide collaboration and innovative solutions, local improvements in basic needs are possible in the next 3-5 years. Prioritization Improving basic needs of living is highly valued: 96% of residents agreed in a survey that it is important to meet the basic needs of people in our community. Large proportions of households struggle to meet at least some of these basic needs. For those who can't meet basic needs, the impact on health and quality of life can be severe. Conversely, if we are 15 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | Munson Medical Centerable to improve this issue, it would improve the root cause of many health inequities in our counties. Groups saw this issue as an ideal area for diverse partners to come together to share resources and strategies and collaborate toward tangible community improvement. For these reasons, basic needs of living was identified as a strategic priority in the Grand Traverse region. Community Voice Residents said when it came to supporting their health, they want and value: Services to meet basic needs Clean natural environment Access to healthy food Outdoor and indoor opportunities for physical activity (especially low-cost) Improved transportation Improved community infrastructure (e.g. sidewalks, community gardens, tobacco-free policies, playgrounds, handicap accessibility, etc.) When surveyed, residents ranked this issue as the most urgent of all the strategic issues identified. 81% of resident respondents agreed that many people in their community struggle to meet basic needs of living. \"I think there are elderly, mentally ill, and disabled people who are falling through the cracks.\" - Antrim County Resident \"Everyone is struggling and one or two paychecks away from being homeless.\" - Grand Traverse County resident Community Organizations cited the following as significant, growing threats in Northern Michigan: Poor quality housing No regional plan to set up communities to meet the needs of the aging population Threats to water and air quality Wages don't keep up with the cost of living; generational poverty Lack of affordable childcare 16 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | Munson Medical CenterStrategic Issue: Improve access to comprehensive health care for all Health Impact According to Healthy People 2020, access to health care is important for: overall physical, social, and mental health status; disease prevention; detection, diagnosis, and treatment of illness; quality of life; preventable death; and life expectancy. Health Equity One example of inequities in access to care are the significant disparities in insurance coverage among different races/ ethnicities. In the Grand Traverse region, this mostly impacts Native American and Hispanic populations. For example, a Native American resident of Leelanau County is three times more likely to be uninsured compared to a white resident. Hispanic residents throughout the region are about twice as likely to be uninsured compared to white residents. Low-income people and people living in rural areas also have more challenges accessing health care, including additional challenges related to transportation, cost of care, distance to providers, inflexibility of work schedules, child care, and other issues. Challenges Residents of the Grand Traverse region experience a variety of barriers to accessing health care, including problems with transportation, appointment availability, and certain provider shortages. In addition, 11% of non-elderly adults in the region are uninsured, and between 8% and 15% of adults said high cost of care prevented them from seeing a doctor when they needed to in the past year. Assets, Resources, and Opportunities Munson Healthcare hospitals and local health departments play key roles in working to improve access to health care. For example, Munson Healthcare and local health departments offer health insurance navigation support during open enrollment periods. New recruitment of primary care providers also has been a focus of Munson Healthcare hospitals. Other programs to help link people to care include: the Community Connections program through the Community Health Innovation Region; referrals through the WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) program; and 211.Prioritization This strategic issue was not chosen as one of the top issues because many of the barriers to accessing health care will be relieved in some way through addressing basic needs of living and mental health/substance use. In addition, barriers to care are not the root cause of poor health, and a more upstream approach is needed to be most effective at improving population health in the long term. 17 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | Munson Medical CenterStrategic Issue: Foster a sense of community that promotes trust and inclusiveness A growing body of research shows that social connectedness creates resilience which protects health. In contrast, community social ills like social isolation, discrimination, and sexual harassment/assault create vulnerabilities which can have a devastating impact on health. Social isolation and social disconnectedness have a significant negative association with physical health (e.g. blood pressure and mortality), mental health (e.g. depression and suicide), drug use, and poor quality of life. In contrast, positive human relations and social interaction are predictors of good health, longevity, lower mortality, and delayed onset of cognitive impairment and dementia. Health Equity Certain populations are at significantly higher risk for social isolation, including racial and religious minorities; seniors who live alone; and the 10% of Grand Traverse region teens who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. In the US overall, 4 in 10 LGBT+ youth say the community in which they live is not accepting of LGBT+ people, and they are twice as likely as peers to report being physically assaulted. Girls and women are also at increased risk of violence, especially from an intimate partner. Seniors are at increased risk of social isolation because of their limited mobility, decreasing social networks due to death of their partner(s) and peers, and changes in their social roles due to retirement and loss of income. Social support can also be the difference between stability and instability within a family. Family instability harms children's health and contributes to health disparities. In addition, limited social networks can reduce access to resources to meet basic needs and further exacerbate inequities. Challenges In the Grand Traverse Region, about half of teens say they know an adult in their neighborhood they could talk to about something important, and 2 in 5 teens have experienced at least two Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE's). These are both risk factors for serious health conditions later in life. In Grand Traverse County, 1 in 5 teen girls has been forced to do sexual things they did not want to do by someone they were dating in the past 12 months. Among householders over 65, 44% live alone in Grand Traverse County. Assets, Resources, and Opportunities Many groups throughout the five counties are working to build community. Senior centers and meals on wheels work to connect older adults. Some schools and libraries are working toward becoming community centers. Faith-based groups and non-profits create ways to engage and volunteer. YMCA and other recreation opportunities bring people together. Up North Pride is working to provide an inclusive environment for LGBT+ residents. Various clubs and 4-H provide other ways to engage in community. There is also movement within some organizations and businesses to prioritize a sense of community among their employees. Through the activities of Trauma and Resilience Unified Support Teams and Northwest Michigan ACE's Initiative, communities are coming together to discuss collaboration in reducing adversities and improving outcomes for multiple generations. Prioritization Sense of Community was not chosen as a top priority, in part because it does not have as severe, immediate impact on health as some of the other issues. However, the need to bring people together can potentially help inform the way we address the other priorities we have chosen. Community Voice Residents said when it came to supporting their health, they highly value support from family, friends, and community. In addition, residents said they want to see more community connectedness and more opportunities for social support. When surveyed, residents most strongly agreed that improving sense of community, support, and inclusion would improve their families' quality of life - more than any of the other Strategic Issues. Over 90% of survey respondents agreed that it is important to build a sense of community where they live. \"People need to feel included. That's a basic need. I'm not sure what the solutions are.\" - Leelanau County resident \"I believe that church communities can help facilitate this. They just need direction and ideas.\" - Antrim County resident \"[We] have to ensure the inclusion truly is inclusive; while there ARE community building events/activities, they seem quite elitist/ exclusive toward some.\" - Grand Traverse County resident \"I believe we have more stigma associated with the elderly... for this reason they are often overlooked.\" - Leelanau County resident Community Organizations cited social isolation, increasing discrimination and harassment, and distrust of information and institutions as significant, growing threats in northern Michigan. These organizations said that improving community connectedness would build resilience for families, and would improve resilience & advocacy for older adults, especially against various forms of abuse or exploitation.18 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | Munson Medical CenterStrategic Issue: Improve prevention and reduce health risks for leading causes of death Challenges Heart disease and cancer are by far the leading causes of death across the Grand Traverse region. Chronic lower respiratory diseases - most commonly caused by smoking - also stand out because the death rate is higher than the Michigan and US averages. Preventing these leading causes of death will require lowering the obesity rate, decreasing tobacco use, and improving vaccination rates. For example, 62% of residents did not get a flu shot in the past year - leaving vulnerable residents like small children and the elderly at increased risk of serious illness and death. Health Equity Leading causes of death include heart disease, cancer, lung diseases, stroke, injuries, Alzheimer's Disease, diabetes, and pneumonia/influenza. Assets, Resources, and Opportunities A variety of local organizations offer health education opportunities, and programs like Northern Michigan Diabetes Initiative and Shape Up North aim to reduce risk of chronic diseases. Other program examples include FitKids360; smoking cessation; senior center \"Balance\" program; and Fruit and Veggie Rx Programs.Leading Causes of Death (with age-adjusted death rate per 100,000 population) Rank Cause of Death MI Benzie Grand Traverse Kalkaska Leelanau Antrim 1 Heart Disease 199 132 135 235 103 166 2 Cancer 170 154 150 187 130 168 3Chronic Lower Respiratory Diseases45 43 41 60 27 43 4 Unintentional Injuries 42 59 44 58 36 42 5 Stroke 37 32 41 47 27 31 6 Alzheimer's Disease 28 32 50 35 34 51 7 Diabetes Mellitus 22 35 15 48 12 18 Source: 2012-2016 Geocoded Michigan Death Certificate Registries, Division for Vital Records & Health Statistics, Michigan Department of Health & Human Services. 19 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | Munson Medical CenterPrioritization Reducing risks for leading causes of death was not chosen as a priority because the most significant factors in reducing risks are included in the other issue areas described. This is especially true for the chronic diseases, which are most impacted by upstream approaches through addressing issues like basic needs. Community Voice Residents said when it came to supporting their health, they value and want health knowledge, like additional education on healthy living. When surveyed, 83% of residents agreed that improving this issue would improve quality of life for the community; 61% said it would improve their family's quality of life. Over 95% of survey respondents agreed that it is important to prevent and reduce leading health risks. \"I think part of this has to do with informing the community about what is currently available and how to access it.\" - Grand Traverse County resident Community Organizations cited our aging population as one of the most significant trends in this area. Improving the Planning Process In addition to the strategic issue, we identified two major areas for improvement in how we go about addressing these issues and planning interventions: 1) Improve cross-sector collaboration and the community health improvement planning process; and 2) Improve community voice and participation in planning. Improving the Planning Process: Strengthen Collaboration Locally and across northern Michigan, there is growing recognition that developing partnerships across the public, private, and non-profit sectors creates unprecedented opportunities for improving life in our communities. Local organizations serving the community said significant, sustainable changes will require a more collaborative, comprehensive approach to community improvement planning. As we move forward and design plans to address the priority issues we have identified, a cross-sector approach will be crucial for success. Community Voice When surveyed, nearly 3 in 5 residents said improving coordination across different kinds of organizations would improve quality of life for their family, while 84% said better coordination would improve quality of life for their community. More than 90% said they believe it is important for local organizations to work together better. \"We have several organizations in Benzie County that partner with multiple other groups to try to reach as many people as possible.\" - Benzie County resident \"Many organizations have the same goals and, without communi - cation, compete for the same funds...\" - Grand Traverse County resident Community organizations said to achieve significant, sustainable community improvement, we need to: Use a coordinated, comprehensive approach to planning Improve process for community improvement planning Align goals, strategies, and vision Maximize limited resources Improve data sharing and communication Improving the Planning Process: Empower Residents and Stakeholders Local organizations reported this as an important step in making significant, sustainable changes in the community to improve quality of life. They emphasized a need to include \"authentic voices\" in decision making, ensuring those most affected by the issues are part of designing the solutions. Including authentic 20 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | Munson Medical Centervoices in decision-making also is necessary in the pursuit of health equity. As we move forward in the planning process, we will need to ensure residents and diverse community stakeholders are at the table when decisions affecting the community are being made. In addition, we need to work on improving communication among organizations, to the community, and from the community. Community Voice When surveyed, more than half of residents said more representation in decision-making would improve quality of life for their family, while 77% said more representation would improve quality of life for their community. Over 90% said they believe it is important for local organizations to work together better. \"[We need to] involve community members in decision making by way of community meetings, public announcements, social media, mailings etc.\" - Benzie County resident Community organizations said to achieve significant, sustainable community improvement, we need to: Include more partners at the table Include more residents at the table Create a system to better capture constituent voice Improve communication to community Improve communication with partners Next Steps The next step will be to create a Community Health Improvement Plan. This will mean gathering diverse partners and representation from the community to identify specific goals and objectives related to our strategic priorities. Because MiThrive is focused on collaborative solutions, the plan will include room for organizations from every sector to play a role contributing toward the goals we identify. Through collaboration and continued monitoring and evaluation, we will be able to address these important issue and improve health and wellbeing in our region.21 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | Munson Medical CenterSteering Committee Throughout the Community Health Needs Assessment process, MiThrive has prioritized inclusiveness and kept meetings open to any organization interested in attending.

9 Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services; *Data not available Secondary Data Analysis Methodology To determine which statistics represented the worst or most concerning outcomes for the counties, we used a standardized scoring process to compare different kinds of indicators. Scoring is based on making comparisons to other counties, to state and national averages, and to previous years - depending on what comparisons are available. Scoring is done in 4 stages: 1. For each indicator for each county, make all available comparisons to determine the standardized score (e.g. how much better or worse is a particular county's smoking rate than the state average? How much better or worse is it compared to 5 years ago?). For each indicator, between one and six comparisons are made. The standardized score will be between 0 and 3 (e.g. Grand Traverse County's score for \"Smoking Rate\" is 0.5). 2. Summarize indicator scores by averaging all the indicator scores within each topic area (e.g. Grand Traverse County's score for Substance Use is 1.6). 3. Summarize topic area scores for the region by averaging the scores of the counties in the region for each topic area (e.g. the regional score for Substance Use is 1.7).

We can only work with the data we have, which can be limited at the local level in Northern Michigan. Much of the data we have has wide confidence intervals, making many of these data points inexact. Some is data missing for some counties - as a result, the \"regional average\" may not include all counties in the region. Some Topic Areas had only one or a few indicators included in it; access to other relevant indicators may shift the score and paint a different picture. For example, only one indicator was available for Housing Quality. Indicators representing other aspects of Housing Quality may have changed the final score for the Topic Area. In contrast, Substance Use included 18 indicators; therefore, we have more confidence that a high score in this Topic Area is meaningful. Secondary data tells only part of the story. If we did not have indicators related to a certain topic, it will not show up as a priority in this part. Environmental data, for example, is significantly lacking. Viewing all the assessment holistically is therefore necessary.36 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment | Munson Medical CenterAppendix C Health Care Providers Survey - Results Total Respondents: 157 (5-County Grand Traverse Region only) RN or LPN Physician Other NP or PA Health Ed./Community 9% 8% of the patients you serve are on Medicaid? 50% Percentage of Providers25% 0% 75% patients15-30% of patientsMore than half of my practice's patients are on MedicaidStrategic issues ranked from 1 (need to address first, most urgent) to 5 (least urgent). 1.
