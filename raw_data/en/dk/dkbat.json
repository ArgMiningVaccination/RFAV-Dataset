INTRODUCTION Kemin Foods, L.C., d/b/a Kemin Health (\"Kemin\"), respectfully submits this Petition to the National Organic Standards Board (\"NOSB\"), seeking the placement of an appropriately food-grade version of lutein, purified from marigold, with a suitable status for use in infant formula, on the National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances (\"National List\") under 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.606, \"Nonorganically produced agricultural products allowed as ingredients in or on processed products labeled as 'organic'\". Based on the practice of allowing additional descriptive information to appear with substances appearing on the National List, and in order to avoid confusion related to another Listed substance,1 Kemin requests that the proposed listing wording include a compendial reference to the U.S. Pharmacopeia (\"USP\") to generally identify lutein that is food grade. Specifically, Kemin requests that lutein be listed as \"Lutein - derived erecta ), by the U.S. Pharmacopeia (\"USP\").\" 2 referred to within this Petition as \"Lutein (USP)\".3 Lutein (USP) is derived from food grade marigolds, which are harvested and dried. This plant-based material is then minimally processed in a similar manner to other ingredients recommended by the NOSB for listing under 7 CFR \u00a7 205.606, including non-amidated low-methoxy pectin (produced by de-esterification using an acid, alkali, or enzyme in the presence of an alcohol), and lecithin- 1 Notably, under 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.606, 42 of the 46 Listed substanc es contain supplemental information aside from the substance name. In 28 cases, this additional information is in the form of a Chemical Abstract Services or \"CAS\" number and in the remaining cases the text varies, but in all cases t he additional information provides clarification or qualification related to the listed substances. It theref ore appears that Listings with supplemental qualifying information, CAS number or otherwise, are acceptable. In the case of lutein, a listing of \"Lutein\" without qualification could be interpreted to include lutein esters, which are not chemically identical to the non-este rified lutein found in dietary foods such as spinach and kale, and also does not have a suitable status fo r addition to infant formula. Additiona lly, the CAS # 127-40-2 that would be used to denote lutein is already used to in conjunction with anot Listed substance, \"pumpkin color extract\" CAS number for \"xanthophylls\", which is not a single substance but a subclass of carotenoids which consist of oxygenated carotenes, such as lutein [IUPAC. Compendium of Chemical Terminology, 2nd ed. (the \"Gold Book\")]. Currently, there is no discrete CAS number fo r lutein. In terms of the Na tional List, listing lutein coup led with CAS #127-40-2 would not generally describe lutein, and moreover it would likely cause confusion based on the existing use of the CAS number for \"pumpkin color extract\". The proposed listing wording, including the USP reference, most accurately describes the non-esterified dietary form of lutein that is food grade, and may be added to both foods/beverages and infant formula. 2 A monograph for lutein is contained in the \"Dietary Supplem of Lutein meeting the USP monograph only be obtained from Tagetes erecta, must be saponified, and may contain not less than 74% lutein, and not more than 8.5% zeaxanthin. Additionally, the chromatically detected peak area of lutein may not be less than 85% and the zeaxanthin peak may not be more than 9% of t he total peak area detected. Kemin's FloraGLO Crystalline Lutein fully complies with the A) 3 Kemin a product that is compliant with the USP monograph for lutein, known as FloraGLO\u00ae Crystalline Lutein that is GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) for use in specific foods and beverages , and also for use in infant formula. As support for the listing request above, this Petition pr esents specific and detailed information for Kemin's Lutein (USP), FloraGLO Crystalline Lutein. Importantly, references to CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 unbleached (which employs hexane). Food grade marigold oleoresin is Kemin's starting material for production of its Lutein (USP) product. While the material is not organic, because of its specifications [and controlled supply ], the marigold oleoresin is of high quality with a low impurity profile. CBI Deleted Lutein (USP) contains at minimum 74% non-esterified, \"free\" form of the dietary substance, lutein. The free-form is the same form found in commonl y consumed foods, such as spinach and kale, and is also the form found in human breast milk. Importantly, lutein is a beneficial nutrient that is not produced by the body and must be obtained from the diet. The free form of lutein comprises the macular pigment (Bone et al., 1985), and is found in the lens (Yeum et al., 1999; Yeum et al., 1995), in both cases acting to filter out damaging blue light (Landrum and Bone, 2001). It is well recognized for its reported benefits for eye health and function, and for its protective role as an antioxidant. Lutein is also present in serum, the skin, brain and a number of other organ systems of the body. Conventional foods are being increasingly fortified with lutein as the scientific literature reports its new benefits for eye health and function, skin health, and cognition (Section 9.2.4.2.2). The scientific literature reports that 6 - 10 mg of lutein should be consumed daily to achieve its nutritional benefits. However, traditional consumption of lutein (and zeaxanthin) from dietary sources in the U.S. population (as surveyed) is an estimated 1.71 (mean) and 3.01 (90th percentile) mg/person/day (IOM, 2001). Based on this typical intake, and the resulting gap where less than one-third of the amount of lutein necessary for health benefits comes from traditional dietary sources, lutein-fortified foods are important sources of this key nutrient. With respect to infants and young children, the presence of lutein in newborn eyes can reduce the oxidative and blue-light damage that can occur (Granot and Kohen, 2004; Hardy et al., 2000; Dillon et al., 2000; Hammond, 2007) (Section 9.2.4.2.1). While the free-form of lutein does appear in human breast milk, study results discussed more fully in Section 9.2.4.2.1 suggest that the lutein levels in breast milk of women consuming a traditional Western diet are lower than those measured in countries where more leafy green vegetables appear to be consumed (Canfield et al., 2003). Further, it's estimated that only half of U.S. infants are exclusively breast fed at birth according to the American Academy of Pediatrics; accordingly, many formula-fed infants may not be provided with a number of the nutrients found in breast milk (Pediatrics, 2005). Under the conditions of intended use for infant formula, the targeted lutein levels will be 25 g/L for infant formulas (not to exceed 250 g/L in the finished formula), which is an amount consistent with the reported range of mean lutein concentrations of 15-44 g/L in breast milk, and also with the overall mean of 25 \u00b1 19 \u00b5g/L (Canfield et al., 2003). Additionally, nursing mothers may benefit from the availability of lutein-fortified organically labeled foods in order to increase their overall consumption of lutein. The safety of Lutein (USP) is well-documented. Kemin's Lutein (USP) ingredient has been the subject of a number of GRAS reviews, including tw o GRAS notifications to FDA, both resulting in letters of non-objection from the Agency (one for a list of conventional foods [June 2004 FDA Letter of Non-Objection, Appendix A] and one inclusion Lutein Petition September 2011 Kemin Health, L.C. 3 20% Liquid in Safflower Oil in infant formula [October 2007 FDA Letter of Non-Objection, Appendix A]). Importantly, the GRAS reviews and subsequent letter of non-objection cited here pertain only to FloraGLO\u00ae Crystalline however, other Lutein (USP) suppliers may choose to assemble their own information to obtain GRAS status for similar or additional uses in conventional foods. A detailed account of the GRAS applications and use levels is provided in Section 3.1 and further det ails of FloraGLO Crystalline Lutein's GRAS status are discussed in Section 7.1. Additionally, the Joint WHO/FAO Expert Committee on Food Additives (\"JECFA\"), which is specifically charged with reviewing the toxicity of food additives, has determined that lutein meeting FloraGLO Crystalline Lutein's specifications, has an Acceptable Daily Intake (\"ADI\") of 2 mg/kg/bw. Moreover, as discussed in Sections 7.4 and 10.1, the safety of both lutein and Kemin's Lutein (USP) (FloraGLO Crystalline Lutein) has been reviewed by other authoritative governmental bodies in regions such as the European Union, Canada, Brazil and Korea, as well as by other scientific bodies such as the European Food Safety Authority (\"EFSA\"), and has been determined to be safe for its intended uses. Kemin submits that the information contained herein related to its Lutein (USP) product, and Lutein (USP) generally, supports that this material, when mixed with organic delivery ingredients, is eligible for addition to the National List, and further that its inclusion is consistent with the National Organic Program objectives of selective listing of subst ances that may be used in organic handling. This listing will allow Lutein (USP) to be available to purchasers of organic infant formula and other organically labeled food which can serve as mechanisms to provide this important nutrient, consistent with the organic philosophy, to mother and baby. Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 ITEM A 1. CATEGORY Kemin respectfully submits this petition requesting the inclusion of Lutein as \"Lutein-- derived by the U.S. Pharmacopeia (\"USP\")\" (when mixed with organic delivery ingredients including organic corn or safflower oil, and organic sugar and starch)4 as a listed substance pursuant to 7 CFR \u00a7 205.606, on the National List of Allowed and Prohibited Substances in the category of \"Nonorganically produced agricultural products allowed as ingredients in or on processed products labeled as 'organic'\". This Petition is submitted pursuant to The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (\"OFPA\")5, and the National Organic Program (\"NOP\") regulations codified at 7 CFR \u00a7 205. 2. CATEGORY JUSTIFICATION Lutein (USP) is an agricultural product, obtained from an agricultural source of nonorganically produced marigold (Tagetes erecta) flower petals, containing a purified form of the marigold- derived substance lutein, in a form recognizable as obtained from marigold. Accordingly, Lutein (USP) is eligible for listing under 7 CFR \u00a7 205.606. 6 As discussed more fully in Section 5 using Kemin's process for its Lutein (USP) (FloraGLO Crystalline Lutein) as an example, Lutein (USP) is not derived from a synthetic source, nor are any processing steps employed that would render the material synthetic. In further support of listing Lutein (USP) under 7 CFR \u00a7 205.606, Kemin compares substances currently listed or recommended to be listed under the same category with similar processing principles: the pectins, which includes both high- and low- methoxyl pectins (\"HMP and LMP\") 7, and lecithin-unbleached. 4 Two product forms, manufactured by DSM Nutritional Pr oducts, LLC (\"DSM\"), also use a small amount of DL-alpha- tocopherol (vitamin E) which is listed under 5 7 CFR \u00a7 205.2, an agricultural commodity or product t hat is further processed and marketed in the US for human consumption would be considered an \"agricultural product.\" Alternatively, non-agricultural substances under the same regulations are defined as 1) products not from agriculture, or 2) substances which are obtained from an agricultural product, but are not recognizable as the agricultural source in the finished form of the processed product, with the examples given as gums, pectin, and citric acid. 7 Both low- and high- methoxyl pectins are alternatively refe rred to as low- and high- \"methoxy\" in documents reviewed by the NOSB, and posted on the NOP site. Kemin underst ands in terms of NOSB/NOP doc uments that \"methoxyl\" and \"methoxy\" are interchangeable and to refer to the same substances. Kemin Health, L.C. 4 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 Agricultural Product Classification The manufacture of Kemin's Lutein (USP) uses a patented, purified extract from an agricultural product, marigold flower (Tagetes erecta). The characteristic color-component of marigolds is a class of compounds called xanthophylls, which include lutein and zeaxanthin, and marigolds are purposely used since they offer an abundant source of these pigments. Through Kemin's process (described in detail in Section 5), the xanthophylls contained in the marigold petals are extracted and processed into a marigold oleoresin, which is then further processed into Lutein (USP). At no point in production is there a processing step whereby Lutein (USP) would be considered synthetic. Upon finishing, the Lutein (USP) retains the orange-red pigment characteristic to the source marigolds, and is also composed majorly of the marigold-derived xanthophylls lutein and zeaxanthin which are the most abundant pigment components found in the marigold flower. In fact, the characteristic marigold color (\"orange-red\") and xanthophyll content are indicators of material quality for Kemin's Lutein (USP) and are checked by Kemin's Quality department as a requirement of material release. Moreover, labeling of certain foods (dietary supplements) containing Lutein (USP) must indicate not only lutein as an ingredient, but must also list both the source plant and plant part parenthetically, e.g. lutein ( Tagetes erecta labeling regulations.8 While Lutein (USP) is significantly purified so as not to contain marigold petals or petal-parts, it nonetheless does retain the original pigment from marigolds, and food product labeling clearly indicates Lutein (USP) products are derived from marigold flowers. In a directly analogous case, pectin is also a component of various agricultural products, and is sourced commercially from fruits such as apples and oranges (Technical Evaluation Supplemental Report, Non Amidated Low Methoxyl Pectin, 2010). Commercial processing of pectin is mainly from apple pomace and orange peel (Technical Evaluation Report, Non Amidated Low Methoxyl Pectin, 2009) and this material undergoes a multi-step process first to become HMP, and then HMP is further processed to become LMP. Both forms of pectin occur as a dry product that is cited in NOSB documents as \"...a white, yellowish, light grayish or light brownish power Report, Non Amidated Low Methoxyl Pectin, HMP is currently listed under 7 \u00a7 CFR 205.606, and there has been a recent recommendation to modify this HMP listing to include both HMP and LMP (LMP is currently listed as a synthetic substance) under the heading \"Pectin (non-amidated forms only)\". In their present forms of a light colored powder, HMP and LMP appear to be sufficiently unaltered from their agricultural source to qualify for listing as an agricultural product under 7 CFR \u00a7 205.606. Both the pectins and Lutein (USP) are derived from agricultural products and both occur in finished form as a dry powder. Lutein (USP) can clearly be recognized as a product of marigold 8 21 C.F.R. \u00a7101.36. Kemin Health, L.C. 5 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 based on its retention of the specific marigold pigments and labeling requirements; therefore, Lutein (USP) should be considered similarly eligible for listing under 7 CFR \u00a7 205.606. Non-Synthetic Solvent Use In the production of a Lutein (USP), the mari gold petals are extracted with hexane to obtain xanthophylls in the form of a marigold oleoresin. The solvent is then removed and analytical results demonstrate that residual hexane in Kemin's finished Lutein (USP) product is [non- detectable at <0.8 listed CFR \u00a7 205.606, \"Lecithin- unbleached\", also uses hexane in its production. CBI Deleted Soybeans are generally known as the best source of naturally occurring lecithin, and all documentation regarding lecithin posted online by the NOP indicates that soy is the reviewed source for the lecithin listings on the National List. 11 Soy lecithin is obtained from soybean oil that is extracted using hexane, with subsequent separation of the lecithin fraction by centrifugation for potential further refining. Importantly, when soy is the source of lecithin, hexane is likely used to obtain the starting soybean oil regardless of the further refining of the lecithin by bleaching or de- oiling. The NOSB, after reviewing a petition requesting the removal of bleached lecithin from the National List, recommended its removal based on the availability of organic lecithin and not based CBI Deleted [9 0.8 ppm is the detection limit of Kemin's internally scien tifically validated hexane analysis method. An accurate characterization would also be \"non-detected\" however, t he qualification of t he detection limit has been provided for clarity. ] 10 According to the NOSB Recommendation for Classification of Materials of November 5, 2009, extraction using a synthetic solvent would not render a substance synthetic, unle ss the synthetic solvent chemically altered the substance or the synthetic material remained in the resulting product at significant levels. Additionally, in the NOSBs subsequent draft guidance document, (National Organic Standards Board - Joint Materials and Handling Committee Classification of Materials - DRAFT Guidance document March 1, 2010) al so made a similar statement (page 6) and further, noted that; \"...if a synthetic chemical used in the process is not removed from the final material, then the material is classified as synthetic...\" A reasonable interpretation of the above statement, consistent with the current listing of an ingredient that uses a solvent in its production, is that if a synthetic chemical is used, AND removed from the material, the subject material would NOT be classified as synthetic. \"Removed\" is not defined; however, a possibl e definition may be that non- detection at a reasonable detection limit by a scientificall y valid method would demonstrate appropriate removal of a compound. This is the case with Kemin's FloraGLO Crystalline Lutein material. 11 National Organic Program Database . Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 on use of hexane.12 Within the same recommendation, the NOSB also recommended to list \"lecithin-de-oiled\" under 7 CFR \u00a7 205.606. In November, 2010, a notice of a proposed rulemaking appeared in the Federal Register to remove \"Lecithin-bleached\" from the National List, and consistent with the NOSB recommendation, the removal was based on availability of organic lecithin and not the use of hexane. The proposed rule also did not propose to delist \"Lecithin- unbleached\", listed in 7 CFR \u00a7 205.606, but rather it stated that \"This proposed action would not prohibit nonorganic forms of bleached, de-oiled lecithin...\"13 The recommendation by the NOSB, as well as the text published in the proposed rule related to \"Lecithin-de-oiled\" indicates that use of hexane during processing, subject to its removal from the finished product, does not preclude a substance from being listed under 7 CFR \u00a7 205.606. De-Esterification The main raw material marigold oleoresin, undergoes (p ropylene glycol) and a base (potassium hydroxide) ] to produce a material comprised primarily of a purified \"free\" or non-esterified form of lutein. Again, using the example of the pectin group, the defining difference between HMP and LMP is the degree of esterified fully Section 5.3.1, LMP is produced directly from the de-esterification of HMP. As mentioned in the previous section, there has been a recent NOSB recommendation to group HMP and LMP into one listing \"Pectin (non-amidated CFR CBI Deleted \"Both high and low methoxy pectin result from the same origin and process which is an extraction and hence non-synthetic. The amid ation process creates a synthetic. The placement of pectin on 205.606 is consistent with OFPA and the NOP.\" 14 Based on the available evidence provided to the NOSB in the Technical Evaluation Report demonstrating LMP is a de-esterified form of HMP, the NOSB recommendation did not cite the de-esterification as rendering LMP synthetic, rather only amidated-LMP was identified as synthetic. In similar fashion to non-amidated LMP, marigold oleoresin undergoes only a simple 12 NOSB Recommendation May, 20069.

Kemin Health, L.C. 7 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 de-esterification with minimal further processing to obtain Lutein (USP) and likewise would be as eligible for listing under the same regulation. Conclusion Based on the above, Lutein (USP) meets the definition of an \"agricultural product\" established by the NOP regulations because its obtained from an agricultural source, is identifiable as derived from its botanical source and the processing and materials used in the production of the product do not render the material to be synthetic. Further, Lutein (USP) and its manufacturing process, in principle, are similar to some materials already listed or recommended to be listed 7 CFR \u00a7 205.606, namely high- and low- unbleached lecithin. Consequently, Kemin submits that Lutein (USP) is eligible for listing under 7 CFR \u00a7 205.606, and is eligible for use in organic handling when mixed with organic delivery ingredients. ITEM B 1.

CURRENT AND INTENDED USES OF LUTEIN (USP) 3.1. Intended Use of Lutein (USP) The overall intended use of Lutein (USP) (in one of the afore-mentioned product forms) is as a dietary substance for use to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake of the beneficial nutrient, lutein. More specifically related to this petition, Kemin desires to obtain a clearance for use of Lutein (USP) in organically labeled foods and infant formula, with usage to be consistent with FloraGLO Crystalline Lutein's, and 20% SAF's, existing GRAS status for certain food applications (October 2007 FDA Letter of Non-Objection, May 12, 2011 Assessment of the Equivalence of FloraGLO Lutein 20% Safflower Oil Manufactured by DSM and Kemin for Use in Infant Formula, both Appendix A). The conditions of FloraGLO Crystalline Lutein's inclusion in organically labeled products are detailed in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2. 3.1.1. Current and Intended Use of Lutein (USP) in Organically Labeled Infant Formula FloraGLO in Safflower Oil suspensions of Kemin's Lutein (USP), and organic safflower oil, are intended for use as a source of \"free\" lutein for addition to organically labeled infant formulas in the U.S. Under the conditions of intended use, the targeted lutein levels will be 25 g/L for infant formulas, which is an amount consistent with reported mean lutein concentrations in breast milk of women ranging from 15-44 g/L and an overall mean of 25 \u00b1 19 \u00b5g/L (Canfield et al., 2003), not to exceed 250 g/L. This GRAS condition of use would also apply to organically labeled infant formula. Based on the maximum GRAS inclusion level, FloraGLO Lutein 20% Liquid in Safflower Oil and FloraGLO Lutein 20% SAF would comprise approximately 0.00017% of a finished infant formula by weight and FloraGLO Crystalline Lutein would be present at no more than 0.000034% by Kemin Health, L.C. 9 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 weight.16 At this maximum allowed inclusion level, Lutein (USP) accordingly does not comprise more than 5% of any finished infant formula product by weight, making it suitable for use in infant formula labeled either as \"organic\" or ''made with organic (specified ingredients or food group(s))''.17 3.1.2. Current and Intended Use of Lutein (USP) in Organically Labeled Foods Provided in Table 3.1.2.a is a list of categories of foods and beverages, with inclusion level ranges related to specific food uses of Kemin's form of Lutein (USP) that may currently be added via its GRAS status. 18 Importantly, the GRAS status afforded Kemin's Lutein (USP) product does not apply to all Lutein (USP) products; however, other suppliers of Lutein (USP) may assemble the necessary information to affirm GRAS status for these food applications as well as other food applications.

HANDLING ACTIVITIES FOR WHI CH LUTEIN (USP) WILL BE USED AND ITS MODE OF ACTION 4.1. Handling Activities 4.1.1. General Food and Supplement Use if Lutein (USP) is Listed Under 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 ents to produce Lutein (USP) finished products, which are the dry and liquid product forms appropriate for addition to organically labeled products. Organic delivery ingredients would include safflower or corn oil for Kemin's liquid products, or sugar and tapioca starch for its dry product forms. In the liquid product forms listed in this petition produced by Kemin's sole licensee and distributor, DSM, would also use organic corn and safflower oil. Additionally, DSM adds minimal am ounts of DL-alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) to its liquid formulations.19 Optimal use of the Lutein (USP) product forms in supplements, foods, and beverages is highly dependent on the finished product matrix and manufacturing process. Each finished food or supplement product manufacturer desiring the inclusion of lutein from a Lutein (USP) product must evaluate which commercial product is most suitable for its product matrix and how to optimally use the product within its process. As stated previously, Lutein (USP) is intended for use as a GRAS ingredient in the afore-listed foods and beverages. Its potential use in products falling within the GRAS food applications and labeled as \"organic\" is subject further to the product composition requirements established by 7 CFR \u00a7 205.301. 4.1.2. For Kemin's Lutein (USP), are currently allowed for use in infant 20% Liquid in Safflower Oil and FloraGLO Lutein 20% SAF. When used as an ingredient in infant formula, FloraGLO Lutein 20% Liquid in Safflower Oil and FloraGLO Lutein SAF are suspended in the oil macronutrient sources. Optimal use is highly dependent on the finished product matrix and manufacturing process. 19 Vitamin E is a listed nutrient under 21 CFR \u00a7104.20. Kemin Health, L.C. 12 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 Based on the inclusion limit established by these products' GRAS status, inclusion of up to 250 g/L of lutein from FloraGLO Crystalline Lutein comprises significantly less than 5% of a finished infant formula by weight, and therefore does not negatively impact any organic labeling statement. 5. SOURCE OF LUTEIN (USP) AND DESCRIPTION OF ITS MANUFACTURE: KEMIN'S PROCESS As discussed in the Introduction, the USP monograph (Appendix A) requires lutein material to be obtained from a natural source, Tagetes erecta, undergo saponification, and meet specific requirements for high purities of beneficial marigold-derived xanthophylls, and low residuals of other compounds. Kemin's FloraGLO Crystalline, meets all of the USP requirements regarding source material, manufacturing principles, and fi nished product specifications, and is therefore considered a Lutein (USP). Accordingly, information contained in Section 5 includes details related to Kemin's process for its Lutein (USP) in support of the Petition information requirements. 5.1. Source of Lutein (USP) 5.1.1. Marigold Oleoresin The starting material for the of Lutein (USP) is a food grade marigold oleoresin 20 which is extracted from dried petals of non-organically grown marigold flowers [Tagetes erecta, Compositae (Asteraceae)] with food grade hexane. [The flowers are grown in India and Thailand from cultivated crops using Good Agricultural Practices (\"GAPs\"), and the resulting marigold oleoresin is purchased by Kemin from a dedicat ed supplier under the terms of a detailed supply agreement.21 The dehydrated marigold flower meal contains xanthophyll pigments on average 13- 17 flowers, 70-75% of is este rified-lutein. The hexane soluble fraction, including xanthophylls, is purified with the subsequent significant removal of the hexane residues by thin film evaporation under heat and vacuum. ] The marigold oleoresin obtained from this extraction contains the pigments from the marigold flowers in their original forms, which include esterified lutein and zeaxanthin, and other lipid solubl e waxes. The xanthophyll component of the marigold oleoresin is what subsequently yields the lutein contained in Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted CBI Deleted[20 Kemin, to its knowledge, is the only manufacturer of non-esterified lutein that uses food grade (i.e., marigolds cultivated and processed expressly for human food use) marigold oleoresin. 21 Kemin's supplier is believed to be the only producer of food grade oleoresin, worldwide. Kemin has used this dedicated supplier for over 10 years, and has a long-term supply agreement with this supplier that extends well beyond the five-year period from approval, wh en it is anticipated, assuming approval, that a new Petition would be required. Kemin can trace all lots of its Lutein (USP) to the spec ific geographic region of no more than 100-120 hectares, including the village and farms, where the source marigolds were grown. ] CBI Deleted Kemin Health, L.C. 13 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 commercial ingredients, and offers the nutritional benefits that are well documented in the scientific literature to be associated with lutein. Upon receipt of marigold oleoresin, Kemin tests each lot of material against its internal specifications to assure that the material has the requisite quality and purity, and meets all of Kemin's established requirements including for those for levels of residual hexane, before being approved for use in Lutein (USP) processing. Importantly, hexane used in the production of marigold oleoresin is used in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice (\"CGMP\") principles and therefore used only in the amount necessary and significant measures are taken to remove it to the extent possible. The processing of marigold oleoresin into Kemin's Lutein (USP) results in hexane being [non-detectable at 0.8 ppm, ] verified by product testing on multiple lots. As discussed in Section A.2, the use and removal of hexane would be similar in principle to hexane use in the extraction of soybean oil in the production of soy lecithin, which already appears on the National List under 7 CFR \u00a7 205.606. CBI Deleted This residual level of hexane is then further reduced by production of subsequent Lutein (USP) commercial product forms, and reduced again by inclusion of commercial Lutein (USP) product forms in other finished products. [As an example, based on the non-detectable limit of <0.8 ppm in Kemin's Lutein (USP), the residual hexane concentration in 1 liter of infant formula containing the GRAS maximum limit of 250 g of lutein from FloraGLO Lutein 20% Liquid in Safflower Oil would be less than 0.0000003 ppm.22 Another example using a food with a higher inclusion level would be soy milk. A traditional serving of soy milk is 8 oz., or 240 mL. Based on the highest amount of lutein GRAS for inclusion in soy milk\u201410 mg, hexane content in one soy milk serving would be only 0.00001 mg, or a concentration of 0.00004 ppm.23] The hexane contribution from Kemin's Lutein (USP) to other GRAS foods and beverages would be similarly low. CBI Deleted 5.1.2. Other Raw Materials Other ingredients used in the production of Lutein (USP) include [propylene glycol, potassium hydroxide24 and water, all suitably food grade, and employed as processing aids.25 Propylene CBI Deleted CBI DeletedCBI Deleted[ 22 Lutein (USP) contains at minimum 740 g (74%) of pure lutein per kilogram of product. In this 740 g of purified lutein, there exists < 0.8 mg hexane. 250 g of (USP) (from Fl oraGLO Lutein 20% Liquid in Safflower would contribute no more than 0.0003 g of hexane per liter of formula, which is a concentration of 0.0000003 ppm. CBI Deleted 23 Similar to the previous calculation, hexane content in 10 mg of Kemin's Lutein (USP) would be no more than 0.00001 mg, or a concentration of no more than 0.00004 mg hexane/L of soy milk. 24 Potassium hydroxide appears on the National List as a subs tance that may be used as a processing aid in organic handling. 7 CFR \u00a7 205.605. ] Kemin Health, L.C. 14 Lutein (USP) Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 CBI Deleted glycol and potassium hydroxide are used extensiv ely in the production of food, and are GRAS when used at levels consistent with GMP.26 Both compounds are water soluble and are removed extensively from Kemin's finished product. ] Different, readily-available organic ingredients can be used in the manufacture of the Lutein (USP) commercial grade products intended for use in organically labelled foods. Currently, these include organic safflower oil, corn oil, tapioca starch, sugar, and in the case of DSM's products, DL-alpha-tocopherol (Vitamin E) which is a listed nutrient under 21 CFR \u00a7 104.20. 5.2. Manufacturing Process Kemin manufactures its Lutein (USP) product in accordance with 21 CFR \u00a7 110 and \u00a7 111 of the CGMPs of the U.S. FDA (21 CFR \u00a7 110 \"Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packaging or Holding Human Food\" and 21 CFR \u00a7 111, \"Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labelling or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements\") and uses a patented technology in a 3-step process that does not include chemical synthesis, but rather extracts the lutein from the agricultural source material. [This patented process employs marigold oleoresin as the starting material, and utilizes the previously identified processing aids, propylene glycol, potassium hydroxide, and water. ] In order to produce Lutein (USP) meeting the GRAS specifications reviewed by FDA and the USP monograph, this patented process using the identified materials is the only process that may be used. The process is described hereafter and shown in Figure 5.2.a. CBI Deleted Kemin's manufacturing facilities and processes used to manufacture Lutein (USP) products have been reviewed and certified as compliant with NSF International, Inc.'s (\"NSF's\") Dietary Supplement Good Manufacturing Practices which are based on 21 CFR \u00a7 111 regulations. Kemin's partner, DSM, manufactures Lutein (USP) products based on 21 CFR \u00a7 110 or the equivalent food good manufacturing practices requirements applicable to European food facilities. 25 FDA defines processing aids as \"Substances that are added to a food for their technical or functional effect in the processing but are present in the finished food at insignificant levels and do not have any technical or functional effect in that food.\" 21 CFR \u00a7100.101(a)(3)(ii)(c).

CBI Deleted During the crystallization step, the marigold oleoresin is subjected to conditions to remove the fatty acids from lutein esters and zeaxanthin es ters. This process empl oys potassium hydroxide (potash), propylene glycol, and water with mixing and heat. During this process crystals of lutein and zeaxanthin are formed. 5.2.2. Centrifugation CBI Deleted The reaction mixture from the crystallization step is diluted with water and the lutein and zeaxanthin crystals are collected by centrifugation and washed with additional water. At this stage, water soluble processing aids are removed from the product. The water used is purified by reverse osmosis. Kemin Health, L.C. 16 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted September 2011 5.2.3. Drying CBI DeletedThe lutein and zeaxanthin crystals are dried by the removal of the residual water, which results in dry cake base. Dry cake base is an intermediate which is additionally screened to become Lutein (USP). In order for Lutein (USP) to be released for further processing with delivery ingredients, it must contain at minimum 74% trans- or \"free\" lutein. CBI Deleted 5.2.4. Mixing Dried Lutein (USP), meeting specification, is mixed with suitable food grade and organic delivery ingredients to formulate Lutein (USP) finished products. CBI Deleted5.2.5. Packaging and Preservation of Product Lutein (USP) is packaged directly into drums and purged with inert gas. All other Lutein (USP) finished product forms are packaged in high-density polyethylene containers affixed with appropriate product labels and tamper-evident, numbered seals. Packaging materials used for all Lutein (USP) products are suitably food grade. CBI Deleted5.2.6. Product Storage Kemin stores its Lutein (USP) products in temperature and humidity controlled warehouses, and segregated based on approval status, in accordance with U.S. CGMPs. ] 5.3. Manufacturing Discussion 5.3.1. Kemin's Process Principles [Marigold oleoresin is reacted with an alkali in the presence of an alcohol, and a hydrolysis reaction in which a fatty acid ester is removed from the esterified lutein to liberate the non- esterified lutein, occurs. As mentioned in Section A.2, the principles of the process steps for Lutein (USP) are analogous to the principles involved in the manufacture of low-methoxyl pectin [LMP, Listed Evaluation Report, Non Amidated Low Methoxyl Pectin, 2009). ] CBI Deleted The defining difference between HMP and LMP is the degree of LMP being <50% esterified. HMP is initially produced by extracting various types of plant material with acidified water. Production of LMP, as described in the Technical Report, is a de-esterification of HMP. LMP can be produced by reacting HMP with one of four substances (an acid, alkali, enzymes, or ammonia) in the presence of an alcohol to de-esterify HMP. Typically, LMP is produced from HMP reac ted with an acid and alcohol, but when LMP is Kemin Health, L.C. 17 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 manufactured with ammonia, in addition to a de-esterification, an amidation reaction occurs. (Technical Evaluation Report, Non Amidated Low Methoxyl 2009). [In similar fashion to non-amidated LMP, marigold oleoresin is reacted with a base in the presence of an alcohol, and undergoes only a simple de-esterification with minimal further processing to obtain Lutein (USP). ] CBI Deleted 5.3.2. Process Controls Kemin has established a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points plan for the processing of Lutein (USP). Additionally, Kemin has voluntarily established procedures within this process which are compliant with the more stringent dietary supplement CGMPs, 21 CFR \u00a7 111. As part of this system, Kemin has established comprehensive specifications for all raw materials used in Lutein (USP) processing. Also established are master manufacturing records and batch record procedures for each Lutein (USP), and Lutein (USP) products. Kemin's Quality Unity performs extensive testing to ensure that both the raw materials used and finished products meet the established specifications for identity, strength, quality, purity and composition. The Quality Unit also performs verification of in-process production information, and reconciles all production records upon completion of each batch of Lutein (USP) product. CGMP audits are conducted monthly by a Food Safety Team assembled of both Quality and Operations personnel, and identified deficiencies are handled through Kemin's Corrective/Preventive Action program, with appropriate follow up. 5.3.3. Process Patents Kemin's Lutein (USP) process and compositional profile described above have been patented by Kemin under U.S. Patents US RE40,912 E, RE40,931 E, RE40,938 E, 5,648,564, and 6,663,900. 27 In order for Kemin to produce Lutein (USP) within the scope of the claims of the listed patents and meeting the specifications in the GRAS documentation and the USP monograph for lutein, this patented process using the identified materials is the only process that may be used. 27 Also protected under Canadian Pat ent 2,239,971, Japanese Pa tents 2,790,212 and 3,190, 686, European Patent Conventions 0672655 and 0904258, Australian Patent 700, 719, Austria Patents 215059 and E191475, Belgium Patents 0904258 and 0672655, Denmark Patent 0672655, Franc e Patents 0904258 and 0672655, Germany Patents 69516031T2 and 69620258, Ireland Patents 0904258 and 06726 55, Israeli Patent 124987, Italy Patent 0672655, Korea Patent 214430, Netherlands Pat ent 0672655, New Zealand Patent 319,825, Mexico Patent 205122, Portugal Patent 0672655, Spain Patent 2147261, Sweden Patent 95300273, Switzerl and Patents 0904258 and 0672655, United and 0672655.

Kosher Both Kemin's and DSM's Lutein (USP) products are certified Kosher by the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregation of America (\"OU\") (certificates in Appendix B). 6.2. Halal Kemin's Lutein (USP) products are certified Halal by the Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America (\"IFANCA\"). Currently, all Lutein (USP) product forms manufactured by DSM referenced in Section 1.3 of this petition are Halal certified (certificates are in Appendix B). 6.3. Good Manufacturing Practices (\"GMP\") Kemin's manufacturing facilities and processes used to manufacture Lutein (USP) related products have been reviewed and certified as compliant with NSF International, Inc.'s (\"NSF's\") Dietary Supplement Good Manufacturing Practices (based on 21 CFR \u00a7 111) (Certificate in Appendix B). Kemin's commercial partner, DSM, manufactures Lutein (USP) products based on current CGMPs for food, 21 CFR \u00a7 110, equivalent food good manufacturing regulations applicable to its European manufacturing facilities, as well as an overarching quality system certification (ISO 9001:2008). 7. INFORMATION REGARDING EPA, FDA, AND STATE REGULATORY REGISTRATION OF LUTEIN (USP) 7.1. United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") The GRAS status of Kemin's Lutein (USP) was initially reviewed by FDA in 2004, upon which Kemin received a letter of non-objection from the Agency (June 2004 FDA Letter of Non- Objection, Appendix A). [In 2008, Kemin Health's GRAS Self-Affirmation expanded its Lutein (USP) uses to additional food applications, as well as increasing the inclusion levels for some existing food applications (2008 Expert Panel Opinion for FloraGLO\u00ae Crystalline Lutein Self- Affirmed GRAS Dossier, Appendix A). This expanded GRAS status of Kemin's Lutein (USP) allows new use levels in a range of between 0.3 mg and 10 mg lutein per serving for conventional foods. ] CBI Deleted Kemin Health, L.C. 19 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy September 2011 FloraGLO Lutein 20% Liquid in Safflower Oil has been GRAS for use as a food ingredient in infant formulas in the U.S. since 2007 (October 2007 FDA Letter of Non-Objection, Appendix A). This GRAS determination was recently amended to include DSM's FloraGLO Lutein 20% SAF (May 12, 2011 Assessment of the Equivalence of FloraG LO Lutein 20% Safflower Oil Manufactured by DSM and Kemin for Use in Infant Formula, Appendix A). The total lutein content from either source of GRAS safflower oil lutein ingredient in finished infant formula product may not exceed 250 g lutein/L, which is equivalent to 37.2 g/100 kcal. 7.2. State of Iowa Kemin's facilities are registered Food Processing Plants with the state of Iowa and are subject to annual audits by the Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals. Kemin Health's most recent certificate is attached in Appendix B. 7.3. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") Kemin's facilities are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency and are in compliance with relevant EPA regulations. 7.4. International Reviews 7.4.1. Canada Xanthophylls, including lutein, are permitted for use as coloring agents in food in Canada according the Food and Drug Regulations (\"FDR\"), Part B, Division 16, and are considered to have a history of safe use for that intended purpose. Health Canada also approved six lutein- enriched novel food products recently. These lutein-enriched products include two juice applications (A. Lassonde and Rubicon Food Products, Ltd.) and four lutein-enriched egg products (Burnbrae Farms, Ltd., L.H. Gray and Son Limited, and Maple Leaf Foods Agresearch, SHUR-GAIN). With respect to Lutein (USP), A. Lassonde, Inc. (a Canadian company) submitted a Novel Food notification to Health Canada in 2006, for a juice product containing Lutein (USP), in the form of Kemin's FloraGLO Lutein 5% Liquid in Corn Oil. Health Canada subsequently determined that Lutein (USP) was safe for addition to juice at 2 mg per serving (250 mL). In addition, various product forms of Lutein (USP) are the subject of Ingredient Master Files submitted to the Natural Health Products Directorate of Health Canada and are widely used in Natural Health Products in Canada. Kemin Health, L.C. 20 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 7.4.2. European Union Lutein has a long history of safe use in Europe as well as in many other countries around the world. Lutein currently has a \"green\" (permissible to use) status as a non-novel food on the European Commission's Novel Food catalogue. Lutein is also authorized as a \"FS\" ingredient for use in food supplements according to the Novel Food catalogue. Lutein (USP) has been widely used in a variety of food and food supplements as a nutrient at dosage up to 20 mg per day since the 1990s. Additionally, lutein from Tagetes erecta has been used as a permitted food color in European countries since the 1970s and is included in the EU Directive on colors for use in foodstuffs (E161b - Directive EC/1994/36). 7.4.3. Japan In Japan, lutein is classified as marigold colorant that is regulated as a food additive in accordance with Japan Food Sanitation Law.28 Lutein (USP) products are widely available in Japan and are permitted for use in foodstuffs and supplements. 7.4.4. China In China, lutein extracted from marigolds was approved as a food and nutritional additive in April 2007 in accordance with the Food Hygiene Law of the People's Republic of China and Hygiene Administration of Food Additives. 29 Accordingly, lutein can be used as a colorant in specified foods including baked foods, drinks (excluding prepackaged drinking water), frozen foods, and jellies and jams; and as a nutrition fortifier in infant formula, formula for follow-up and young children, and formula for preschoolers. Importantly, the approval of lutein as a nutrition fortifier in infant formula was based on the data previously submitted to the Ministry of Health (\"MOH\") for Kemin's Lutein (USP), and the specification for lutein appearing in the approval Annex was set based on information submitted for Kemin's product. There are currently a variety of food products containing Lutein (USP) on the Chinese market following the approval. 28Substances that were already marketed or used on t he date of the amendment of the Food Sanitation Law and appear in the List of Existing Food Additives. 29 http://www.moh.gov.cn/newshtml/18668.htm Kemin Health, L.C. 21 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy 7.4.5. Ag\u00eancia Nacional (\"National Health Surveillance Agency\" or \"ANVISA\"), Brazil's health and food safety agency, has evaluated lutein as a raw material intended for the food, cosmetic, and drug industry. Identity and quality standards for lutein have been reviewed by ANVISA, and with respect to its food characteristics and oral use, lutein has been accepted as a food with functional properties.30 Currently, Lutein (USP) products intended as a raw material for the Brazilian food industry do not need to be individually registered with ANVISA. ANVISA has also granted lutein an approved allegation (claim) as follows: \"'LUTEIN. Allegation: \"Lutein has an antioxidant action, which protects cells against free radicals. Its consumption shall be associated to a balanced diet and healthy life habits.' Remarks: The quantity of lutein contained in the daily portion of the product ready for consumption shall be stated in the label, next to the allegation.\" 31 8. CHEMICAL ABSTRACT SERVICE (\"CAS\") NUMBER AND LABELS 8.1.

The CAS number for xanthophylls is currently being used to describe \"pumpk in color extract\" on the National List. Accordingly, Kemin requests that this number not be used to also describe \"lutein\"; rather, Kemin requests the USP designation be used, which identifies the material as non-esterified lutein, and al so specifies that it is obt ained from a natural source, marigold flowers. Kemin Health, L.C. 22 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 8.2. Product Labels Sample labels for all of Kemin's Lutein (USP) products are included in Appendix C. Also contained in Appendix C, are labels for products that contain Kemin's Lutein (USP). The product labels included for supplements and infant formula cite Kemin's Lutein (USP) as \"lutein\" on their labels, with the supplement further identifying the source of \"lutein\" as FloraGLO\u00ae Lutein. Regarding the conventional beverage label, Lutein (USP) is indicated as \"marigold flower extract (source of lutein and zeaxanthin)\". The subject material of this Petition has been identified as Lutein (USP), however the desired listing wording proposed by Kemin is for \"Lutein - derived from ), by the U.S. Pharmacopeia (\"USP\"). \" Such a listing would ensure the Listed material would be \"Lutein\", but also \"Lutein\" meeting specific composition and quality criteria, suitable for use in supplements, foods, and infant formula. This additional criter ia, which may not be obvious based on reconciling a \"Lutein\" listed in a product's ingredient list, is verifiable by organic formulators and certifiers through a review of lutein product specifications. 9. LUTEIN (USP) PHYSICAL PROPER TIES AND CHEMICAL MODE OF ACTION 9.1. Chemical and Physical Properties 9.1.1. Lutein Background Lutein is a carotenoid naturally found in many fruits and vegetables. While lutein is found in high concentrations in the macula of the eye, lutein must be consumed from the diet. Humans cannot synthesize lutein, and, unlike beta-carotene, humans also cannot convert lutein into vitamin A. Accordingly, lutein cannot be considered to have any vitamin A activity. Lutein, together with zeaxanthin, is found in high concentrations in dark green leafy vegetables (Holden et al., 1999) such as raw kale and spinach, in broccoli and br ussel sprout and in egg yolks. Lutein is naturally forms as all-trans cis- lutein, epoxi-lutein and lutein linked to proteins. Lutein, as found in fruits and vegetables, has been traditionally consumed as part of a natural diet. Additionally, purified lutein in the form of Lutein (USP) is chemically identical to its form found in the natural diet, has been consumed in several countries as an ingredient in dietary and food supplements, and in natural health products in Canada, as well as being present as a constituent of many conventional foods in countries such as the U.S., Europe, China and Japan (see Section 7.4). Lutein is an oxycarotenoid, or xanthophyll, containing 2 cyclic end groups (one - and one -ionone ring) and the basic C 40 isoprenoid structure common to all carotenoids (see Figure Kemin Health, L.C. 23 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 9.1.1.a). Lutein occurs together with zeaxanthin, an oxycarotenoid that is isomeric with lutein, containing 2 -ionone rings rather than one - and one -ionone ring (see Figure 9.1.1.b). In principle, each of the polyene chain double bonds present in lutein and zeaxanthin could exist in a cis or trans conformation, giving rise to a large number of possible mono- cis and poly-cis isomers; however, in practice, the vast majority of carotenoids are in the all- trans configurations (Rice- Evans et al., 1997; IOM, 2000), as depicted in Figures 9.1.1.a and 9.1.1.b. Small amounts of cis isomers of lutein and zeaxanthin, accompanied by their respective all- trans configurations, have been isolated and purified from extracts of marigold flowers, fresh raw kale, corn meal, spinach, and human plasma (Krinsky et al., 1990; Khachik et al., 1999). CH3 and physical characteri stics of lutein and zeaxanthin are outlined in Tables 9.1.2.a and 9.1.2.b, respectively.

Additional Items 9.2.1. Chemical Interactions With Other Substances, Especially Substances Used in Organic Production Lutein (USP), outside of its scientifically supported beneficial function in the human body, is a relatively inert substance not currently known to chemically react with other substances, including those used in organic production. 9.2.2. Toxicity and Environmental Persistence Lutein (USP) is not intended for release into the environment. However, it is a plant-derived substance and biodegradable; upon exposure to light, heat, and oxygen, it would not persist in the environment. There are no known env ironmental risks or toxicity associated with the use or disposal of Lutein (USP). As discussed more fully at Section 10.1.2, toxicological information regarding lutein has been evaluated by the Joint WHO/FAO Expert Committee on Food Additives (\"JECFA\"). JECFA reviewed various types of toxicity data, and the Committee specifically determined that there was no need for a study of carcinogenicity, taking into consideration data showing that lutein was not genotoxic, had no structural alert, did not exhibit tumor-promoting activity, and is a natural component of the human body.

Environmental Impacts From Its Use or Manufacture 9.2.3.1. Marigold Oleoresin Production The botanical source of Kemin's Lutein (USP) is food grade marigold flowers, from sustainable plant stock, [grown in India and Thailand, by Kemin's exclusive supplier. Kemin does not grow CBI Deleted Kemin Health, L.C. 26 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 marigold flowers and is dependent on its suppliers of marigold oleoresin to manage marigold cultivation practices. ] During cultivation of marigolds intended for production of food grade marigold oleoresin, [Kemin's supplier employs Good Agricultural Practices (\"GAPs\") with an established Agricultural Team (\"Team\"). This Team has generated internal GAP processes specifically for marigold cultivation. The Team also monitors and documents all agricultural activities by farmers from seed sowing to harvesting of flowers, and provides training to farmers regarding best practices. Consultations by th e Team are also provided to farmers at various stages during the growing process to ensure the established GAPs are followed. This adherence to GAP supports sustainable agriculture and mi nimal adverse impact on the environment from marigold cultivation. CBI Deleted Kemin's supplier is believed to be the only manufacturer of food grade marigold oleoresin in the world, and manufactures the marigold into food grade marigold oleoresin using CGMP principles. The supplier is certified by the American Institute of Baking (\"AIB\"). The AIB certification follows the FDA's requirements of 21 CFR \u00a7 110 (\"Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packaging or Holding Human Food\"). This adherence to GAP and CGMP by Kemin's supplier supports minimal adverse impact on the environment from marigold cultivation or processing. ] 9.2.3.2. Lutein (USP) Production Presented in Section 5.2 is information related to the manner in which Kemin manufactures Lutein (USP). Kemin does not use volatile organic solvents during processing; therefore there are no issues with human handling, air handling, solvent disposal or solvent recapture. [The processing aids used are water soluble and are washed from the product during the centrifugation step described in Section 5.2.2. This water is captured through separate piping and treated to make it a suitable effluent for transmission via Kemin's regular sewer system to the city wastewater treatment facility. ] Energy consumption from processing is maintained as low as necessary and closely monitored to minimize both cost and environmental impact. There are no other process steps that would significantly impact the environment. CBI Deleted 9.2.4. Effects on Human Health; and Effects on Soil Organisms, Crops, or Livestock 9.2.4.1. Soil Organisms, Crops, or Livestock Lutein (USP) is not intended for use with soil organisms, crops or livestock. Kemin Health, L.C. 27 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 9.2.4.2. A Summary of Beneficial Effects of Lutein (USP) on Human Health 9.2.4.2.1. Infant Formula Lutein is a component of human breast milk, with free lutein considered the predominant form. Human milk contains at least 300 defined nutrients (Jensen, 1995), including more than 30 carotenoids, counting geometrical isomers and metabolites (Khachik et al., 1997). lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-carotene are among the predominant carotenoids in both serum and human milk (Giuliano et al., 1994; Khachik et al., 1997). Several studies report lutein's presence in infant eyes 33 as early as 17-22 weeks gestation (Bone et al., 1988; Handelman et al., 1988). The newborn eye, being a vulnerable organ, is likely protected by lutein from oxidat ive damage and oxidative stress (Perrone et al., 2010), as well as damaging blue light (Granot and Kohen, 2004; Hardy et al., 2000 Dillon et al., 2004; Hammond, 2007). Because only half of U.S. infants are exclusively breast fed, infants not receiving breast milk may not be provided a number of nutrients f ound in breast milk (Pediatrics, 2005), including lutein. The lutein form contained in infant formulas supplemented specifically with FloraGLO Crystalline Lutein (in the forms of in Safflower Oil and is the same free- or non-esterified form of lutein found in human breast milk. For infants not exclusively breast fed, lutein supplemented infant formula offers an additional source of this important nutrient and its benefits. 9.2.4.2.1.1. Lutein is a Component of Human Milk Free, non-esterified lutein is generally considered to be the predominant form of lutein in human milk. Most studies of human milk carotenoids have included a saponification of the milk, saponification being a hydrolysis of ester bonds by a base. Saponification also converts lutein esters to free lutein; therefore, traditional assays of carotenoids in human milk would not detect lutein esters as such, even if present. There is evidence however, that the predominant form of lutein in human milk is free lutein. Schweigert et al. (2000) extracted free lutein from human milk and obtained a higher estimate of total lutein, as well as a higher recovery of spiked lutein, than that obtained by methods that include saponification. Schweigert et al. (2000) extracted lipids into hexane and then back-extracted polar xanthophylls into ethanol/water. Substantially more lutein was present in the back-extracted polar xanthophylls fraction (i.e., without saponification) than in the saponified fraction. The small amount of all-trans lutein that was extracted after saponification 33 Donor eyes. Kemin Health, L.C. 28 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 of the aqueous fraction could represent either free lutein that was not quantitatively extracted prior to saponification, or lutein esters initially in milk. Schweigert et al. (2000) interpreted the result to be free lutein that was incompletely partitioned into the original hexane extract. Regardless, the quantitatively dominant form of lutein in human m ilk was free lutein, as the amount of lutein measured without saponification was a high percentage of total lutein measured and recovery of lutein was greater than 90%. The amount of lutein in the initial aqueous phase, even if corrected for lower recovery following the saponification step, was small. Information specific to infant intakes of lute in/zeaxanthin from human milk is not found in the published literature, though the presence of these carotenoids in human colostrum, transitional, and mature human milk has been documented by several investigators. Canfield et al. (2003) measured carotenoid concentrations in human milk samples from healthy, lactating mothers of healthy full-term infants. Human milk samples were collected from 465 women 18 to 40 years of age from nine countries, including Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The study participants breast fed infants at least five times per day, and reported consuming at least 3 servings of fruits and vegetables (combined) per day. All milk samples were collected between 1 and 12 months postpartum, and therefore represent mature human milk. The over all mean concentration of lutein/zeaxanthin across all study sites was 25 \u00b1 19 \u00b5g/L range of lutein/zeaxanthin, and the range of the individual site means was from 15 to 44 \u00b5g/L, with the highest mean concentrations in milk samples collected from women in China and Japan (44 and 43 \u00b5g/L, respectively). These women were presumably consuming traditional Asian diets rich in leafy greens. The lowest mean lutein/zeaxanthin concentrations were found in milk samples from women in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States; the range of mean lutein/zeaxanthin concentrations in milk from women in these countries, who are likely consuming more traditional Western diets, was 15 to 17 \u00b5g /L, or approximately one-third of the levels identified in samples from the Chinese and Japanese women. The mechanisms underlying the apparent wide variation in milk composition that exists among and between women are not yet fully understood (Picciano, 2001); however, just as dietary intake of carotenoid-rich foods is associated with increased serum carotenoid concentrations (Al- Delaimy et al., 2005; Campbell et al., 1994), dietary intake of carotenoids appears to have an impact on milk carotenoid levels. As shown in other studies, consumption of carotenoid-rich vegetables or supplements by lactating women increased milk levels of these nutrients (Allen et al., 2002; Canfield et al., 1997). 9.2.4.2.1.2. Lutein From Lutein-Supplemented Infant Formula is Bioavailable Infant formulas for term infants in the United States may contain up to 250 \u00b5g lutein /L (October 2007 FDA Letter of Non-Objection, Appendix A). However, typical maximum exposures to term Kemin Health, L.C. 29 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 infants from consumption of U.S. formulas that are fortified with lutein are only 30% of that amount, or approximately 15 mcg/kg bw/day. Thes e estimates are based on the formula intakes reported for healthy term infants 14 to 35 days of age in a clinical study (adapted from Mackey et al., 2008). In that study, twenty-two (22) infants consumed the control formula, 27 infants consumed the low carotenoid (32 mcg lutein (FloraGLO\u00ae)/L) formula, 23 infants consumed the high carotenoid (52 mcg lutein (FloraGLO)/L) formula, and 27 infants were fed human milk. Plasma concentrations of lutein were correlated with intake (r=0.473, p=0.0002). Among the formula-fed infants, baseline plasma concentrations of lutein were not different, though plasma concentrations of the carotenoids in the low and high carotenoid formula groups were significantly lower than concentrations in the human milk group. After 8 weeks of feeding, plasma lutein concentrations in infants fed the high carotenoid formula were significantly higher than levels in infants fed the low carotenoid formula or the control formula. The high-carotenoid formula resulted in plasma levels in the range of infants fed human milk, and comparable to the levels in human-milk fed infants as r eported by other investigators (Bettler et al., 2009). In another dose-response study in term infant s, infants were randomized to consume formula containing 20 (control formula), 45, 120 or 225 mcg lutein/L, and a group of 14 infants were exclusively breast fed (Bettler et al., 2009). At the end of the 12 week feeding study, serum lutein concentrations increased in a dose-dependent manner in the formula groups; the serum lutein concentrations in infants consuming 45, 120 225 mcg lutein/L were 3.59, 10.75, and 19.21 mcg/dL, respectively (geometric means). While t he increase in serum lutein concentration from human milk lutein was found to be approximately 4 times higher than the increase from infant formula lutein, the results indicate that consumption of lutein-fortified infant formula also increase serum lutein levels in infants. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, clinical trial fed LC) to preterm infants (born less than 37 weeks gestation) (Rubin et al., 2011). The mean concentration of lutein in the in-hospital preterm infant formulas was 211 g/L, and the mean concentration in the post-discharge preterm formula was 68.7 g/L. The population in this study was a representative sample of infants who are fed preterm infant formulas in the U.S. Formula intake was monitored daily during the in- hospital phase, and at 40, 44, and 50 weeks post-menstrual age (\"PMA\") during the post- discharge phase (based on 3-day infant dietary intake diaries). In the evaluable group ( i.e., the subpopulation of infants who consumed exclusively or nearly exclusively the assigned study formula), plasma lutein concentrations were higher in the carotenoid formula group compared to the control group (p<0.01). Similarly, at hospital discharge and at 40 and 50 weeks PMA, plasma concentrations of lutein were higher in infants fed the carotenoid formula as compared to infants fed the control formula. Mean plasma concentrations of lutein in infants consuming the carotenoid formulas at 50 weeks were in the range of carotenoid Kemin Health, L.C. 30 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 concentrations in a reference group of term infants 10 to 13 weeks of age in the U.S. who had been fed human milk (Mackey et al., 2008). The bioavailability of carotenoids naturally occurring in human milk is unknown. While the bioavailability of carotenoids from infant form ula appears to be lower than from human milk, the results of these studies demonstrate that the carotenoids added to infant formula are absorbed and appear in the plasma of infants. Lutein fortification of infant formula, therefore, provides a bioavailable source of lutein when mother's milk is not available. 9.2.4.2.1.3. Lutein Benefits for Infants As stated in Section 9.2.4.2.1, lutein and zeaxanthin are present in human eyes 34 as early as 17- 22 weeks gestation (Bone et al., 1988; Handelman et al., 1988). The presence of lutein likely protects the vulnerable newborn eye from seve re oxidative damage occurring during childhood, as well as higher levels of oxidative stress in the retina during this time, which have been linked to clinical disorders and disease states (Granot and Kohen. 2004; Hardy et al., 2000). Additionally, because the infant lens is more transparent than that of an adult, the infant retina may be more susceptible to damaging blue light (Dillon et al., 2004; Hammond, 2007). Thus, the very young could likely benefit from the blue light filtering and antioxidant properties of lutein. Perrone et al. examined the effects of lutein on oxidative stress in infants in a study published in 2010 (Perrone et al., 2010). This randomized, double-blind comparative study was conducted in 20 healthy term infants who received either a liquid supplement containing FloraGLO Lutein (0.28 mg) or a control supplement at 12 and 36 hrs after birth. Blood was drawn immediately after birth and at 48 hrs after birth and analyzed for biological antioxidant potential (\"BAP\") and total hydroperoxides (\"TH\"). There was no difference in BAP and TH between the two groups at birth. TH significantly increased from birth to 48 hrs in the infants fed control formula (p = 0.023) while no increase was observed in the group fed lutein-cont aining formula. BAP si gnificantly increased in the lutein group from birth to 48 hrs (p = 0.028) with no corresponding increase in the infants fed control formula. These results indicate that lutein-containing formula can reduce oxidative stress and protect against oxidation in newborn infants. The authors also noted that no adverse events were observed during the study. 9.2.4.2.1.4. Lutein (USP) - The Same Lutein Form Found in Human Milk In the preparation of Lutein (USP) a saponification step is utilized that liberates free from lutein esters, forming the same lutein molecule predominating in human breast milk (Schweigert 34 These studies used human donor eyes. Kemin Health, L.C. 31 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 et al., 2000). Scientific evidence supports that lutein, including Kemin's Lutein (USP), provided in an infant formula matrix, is bioavailable to infants both term and preterm (Mackey et al., 2008; Bettler et al., 2009; Rubin et al., 2011). Moreover, infants exposed to Lutein (USP) through supplementation exhibited beneficial effects in terms of oxidative stress (Perrone et al., 2010) and may also be provided lutein's established benefits related to eye health. FloraGLO Lutein 20% Liquid in Safflower Oil suspensions of Kemin's Lutein (USP) and safflower oil and GRAS for use in infant formula, provide a source of non-esterified lutein (the same form found in mother's milk) that can be successfully incorporated into infant formula formulations. Lutein (USP) in a formula matrix is a bioavailable source of lutein for infants, and can serve to offer formula-fed infants the benefits of lutein consumption when breast milk is not available. 9.2.4.2.2. Food and Dietary/Food Supplements The role of lutein as a beneficial ingredient for inclusion in foods and dietary/food supplements is thus of increasing importance because of its protective role in eye and skin health. Lutein is the major xanthophyll found in human serum (Yeum et al., 1995) and is concentrated in ocular tissues such as the lens and the macula lutea (Yeum et al., 1995; Landrum and Bone, 2001). Just like other carotenoids, lutein is not synthesized by humans and is only obtained from dietary sources. Lutein is highly concentrated in the central part of the retina called the macula where it works as an antioxidant and as a blue light filter. Lutein's reported antioxidant activity is highly reinforced by the presence in the retina of lutein metabolites coming from lutein oxidation (Bernstein et al., 2001). Findings from a growing collection of placebo-controlled intervention trials indicate that ingestion of lutein containing foods or supplements results in increased macular pigment optical density (\"MPOD\") (Shao and Hathcock, 2006) and may help to improve visual function in patients suffering from Age-Related Macular Degeneration (\"AMD\") and other ocular diseases Falsini et al., 2003; Olmedilla, et al., 2003; Richer et al., 2004, Stringham and Hammond, 2008). The explanation for these findings is both physiological and metabolic, in that lutein and zeaxanthin are the only carotenoids present in the retina and lens, where they act as a filter of blue light and as antioxidants. Lutein is currently a test article in a large, multi-center trial sponsored by the National Institutes of Health National Eye Center, Age- Related Eye Disease Study (\"AREDS2\") that will evaluate the effects of 10 mg of lutein supplementation, daily on patients with AMD. Published relevant human clinical trials (doubl e-blind, randomised, controlled trials and non- randomised, uncontrolled or open-label clinical trials) involved lutein doses from 2.4 to 40 mg/day (Dagnelie et al., 2000; Hughes et al., 2000; Roodenburg et al,. 2000; Aleman et al,. 2001; Hininger et al., 2001; Olmedilla et al., 2004; Th\u00fcrmann et al., 2005; Bahrami, et al., 2006; Shao and Hathcock, 2006; Zhao, 2006). All the results are consistent with respect to Kemin Health, L.C. 32 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 safety, showing no observed or reported adverse effects (Berendschot et al., 2000; Duncan et al., 2002; Bone et al., 2003; Cardinault et al., 2003; Koh et al., 2004). The most recent published scientific literature reports that free lutein, taken at 10 mg daily in combination with 2 mg zeaxanthin, is found in the serum and macula, and can significantly improve visual performance parameters related to veiling glare and photostress recovery in healthy individuals (Stringham and Hammond, 2008). Veiling glare and photostress recovery are associated with night time driving; accordingly improvements in these param eters may translate to improved night driving performance. As with the eyes, lutein has been detected in the skin and is believed to play a similar beneficial role providing antioxidant protection and acting as a filter of high-energy blue light. Published human clinical trials and other data support that lutein, when ingested alone or with other antioxidants, can positively impact skin health by reducing reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation, while increasing skin lipid content and hydration (Palombo et al., 2007). These data support that lutein's antioxidant properties evidenced in the eye, can be extended to provide the same protective effects against light-induced damage in the skin. Lutein is also believed to play a positive role in age-related cognitive decline (Johnson et al., 2008). Lutein's beneficial effects have been recognized by the French health authorities in its issuance of claims that may be made on products containing lutein. The Agence fran\u00e7aise de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sanitaire des aliments (\"AFFSA\") in France determined that two claims regarding lutein (below) were scientifically supported (AFSSA Statement, Appendix A): \"Lutein helps protect the retina and lens from oxidation.\" \"Lutein is one (of the) constituent(s) of the retina and the lens.\" 10. INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE SAFETY OF LUTEIN (USP) AS A FOOD INGREDIENT 10.1. Authoritative Safety Reviews of Lutein (USP) 10.1.1. Generally Recognized as Safe (\"GRAS\") FloraGLO Lutein 20% SAF, has been established in toxicological studies in rats, mice, monkeys and dogs, mutagenicity studies conducted with Salmonella typhimurium , and is further supported by intervention studies conducted with healthy subjects designed to measure metabolic endpoints. The safety of Lutein Kemin Health, L.C. 33 (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 (USP) is also corroborated by additional animal and human studies conducted with other sources of lutein, lutein-rich foods and lutein supplements. Measurements of safety-related endpoints have indicated that oral exposure up to 30 mg lutein per day is not associated with any adverse health effects in healthy human subjects and oral exposure to FloraGLO Lutein 20% Liquid in Safflower Oil at a dose level of 200 \u00b5g lutein/L in infant formula, resulting in a mean intake ranging from 193 to 247 \u00b5g lutein/day, for a period of 16 weeks did not result in any adverse health effects in healthy term infants. In addition, the safety of lutein and zeaxanthin is well established in the literature based on the historical consumption of fruits and vegetables where these carotenoids predominate ( e.g., green leafy vegetables, such as spinach and kale), and the safety of lutein and zeaxanthin for use in infant formulas is demonstrated through their presence in human breast milk. Exposure to lutein from human breast milk varies widely based on the stage of lactation, geographical location, and individual diets, and has been demonstrated to range from 3 to 232 \u00b5g/L in individual mothers from around the world. Mean concentrations at individual sites ranged from 15 \u00b5g/L in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the U.S. to 43-44 \u00b5g/L in China and Japan. The average lutein and zeaxanthin concentration across all of the sites investigated was 25 \u00b1 19 \u00b5g/L (Canfield et al. , 2003). In June, 2004, the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") issued a letter of no objection to an expert panel's finding that Kemin' s form of Lutein (USP) is Generally Recognized as Safe for a variety of food applications, ranging from 0.3 mg to 3 mg per serving, and for medical foods at 10 mg per day (June 2004 FDA Letter of Non-Objection, Appendix A). In October, 2007, the FDA issued a letter of no objection to an expert panel's finding that suspended Lutein (USP) in the form of FloraGLO Crystalline Lutein may be used as an ingredient in term infant formula at a maximum level of 250 g/L is GRAS (October 2007 FDA Letter of Non- Objection, Appendix A). Within the letter, FDA defined the term \"suspended lutein\" to denote the mixture of the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin (free that are suspended in safflower oil. FloraGLO Lutein 20% SAF, manufactured by DSM, also contains Lutein (USP) suspended lutein in safflower oil, and therefore is also covered under this FDA clearance. [In 2008, Kemin Health performed a GRAS Self-Affirmation to expand its Lutein (USP) uses in food applications, as well as increasing the inclusion levels for some existing food applications (2008 Expert Panel Opinion for FloraGLO\u00ae Crystalline Lutein Self-Affirmed GRAS Dossier, Appendix A). The same 2004 panel of Experts reviewed the safety, and other information, specific for Kemin's Lutein (USP) and again concluded that it was safe for the expanded uses. This expanded GRAS status of Kemin's Lutein (USP) allows new use levels that range between 0.3 mg and 10 mg lutein per serving for certain conventional food applications. ] CBI Deleted Kemin Health, L.C. 34 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 10.1.2. Joint WHO/FAO Expert Committee on Food Additives (\"JECFA\") Review 2006 The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (\"JECFA\"), which reviews the toxicity of food additives, completed a safety evaluation of lutein and zeaxanthin from Tagetes erecta and assigned a group acceptable daily intake (\"ADI\") of 0 to 2 mg lutein and zeaxanthin/kg body weight (JECFA, 2006). The JECFA evaluation included consideration of information on the toxicity, identity and purity of Kemin's Lutein (USP). This comprehensive assessment included reviews of acute toxicity in rats, short-term to xicity in mice, rats and monkeys and long-term studies of toxicity, carcinogenicity and genotoxicit y. Additionally, JECFA reviewed reproductive toxicity, inclusive of developmental toxicity data. Special studies evaluating cardiovascular effects and immune response in mice, cats and dogs, and ocular toxicity and dermal and ocular irritation were considered. Observations in humans were also part of the JECFA evaluation, with the recognition that although studies designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of lutein did not necessarily include safety end-points, they also did not report any adverse effects of lutein/zeaxanthin, including at \"high concentrations.\" In its evaluation, JECFA noted that in several studies of toxicity, including developmental toxicity, no adverse effects were documented in animals including monkeys or in humans. The Committee specifically determined that there was no need for a study of carcinogenicity, taking into account data showing that lutein was not genotoxic, had no structural alert, did not exhibit tumor-promoting activity, and is a natural component of the human body. Upon reviewing the body of scientific evidence, JECFA determined that \"the available comparative toxicokinetic data for humans and rats indicated that the studies of toxicity in rats could be used to derive an ADI\" (JECFA, 2006). The ADI, 2 mg/kg/bw, was established based on a NOEL of 200 mg lutein/kg body weight/day (the highest dose tested) reported in a 90-day rat study (Pfannkuch et al. 2000a,b), to which a safety factor of 100 was applied. This safety factor was considered appropriate given the lack of adverse effects reported at much higher doses than 200 mg/kg body weight [up to 1,000 mg/kg body weight/day in a study of developmental toxicity (Edwards et al. , 2002)]. As determined by JECFA, the ADI is a group ADI for lutein and zeaxanthin and is applicable to children who are older than 12 weeks, and only for lutein (and zeaxanthin) meeting the specifications established by JECFA. 10.1.3. European Food Safety Authority (\"EFSA\") Reviews of Lutein for Use in Foods for Particular Nutritional Uses 10.1.3.1. Foods for Special Medical Purpose The AFC (Food Additives, Flavorings, and Processing Aids) Scientific Panel from the European Food Safety Authority (\"EFSA\") was asked to evaluate lutein extracted from Tagetes erecta (marigold flowers) and from some species of edible plants for use in the manufacture of foods for Kemin Health, L.C. 35 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 particular nutritional uses (\"FPNUs\") (EFSA Scientific Opinion, 2006). In 2006, the Panel concluded that the use of lutein, obtained as an extract from Tagetes erecta and from the natural strains of edible fruits and plants, grass, Lucerne (alfalfa), in foods for special medical purposes (\"FSMPs\"), is not of safety concern under the proposed use levels which are in the range of the regular dietary intake of lutein, provided that it is in compliance with the existing EU specifications of lutein as a food additive. The petitioner's proposed uses of lutein in FSMPs were at levels that would give rise to daily intakes within the range of a regular dietary intake of 0.5 mg to 2 mg lutein per day (EFSA Scientific Opinion, 2006). 10.1.3.2. Infant Formula In 2008, EFSA's Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (\"NDA\") was requested to evaluate the safety, bioavailability and suitability of lutein for the particular nutritional use by infants and young children. The panel evaluated a \"purified lutein\" obtained by saponification from an oleoresin from dried marigold flower (Tagetes erecta petals, specifically, liquid in safflower oil\" made of \"purified lutein\" suspended in edible triglyceride and containing at least 20% lutein and 0.8% zeaxanthin by weight. The Panel evaluated the scientific data and concluded that lutein from FloraGLO is bio-available in infant formula, and t here are no concerns about the safety of lutein in infant formula at the levels achieved through the natural content of ingredients nor at the level of use (concentration of added lutein 250 \u00b5g/L) proposed by the applicant for infant formulae with a low natural lutein content (about 20 \u00b5g/L or lower) (EFSA Scientific Opinion, 2008). 10.1.4.

COMPREHENSIVE RESEARC H REVIEWS AND RESEARCH BIBLIOGRAPHIES FOR LUTEIN (USP) 11.1. Research Bibliography A comprehensive literature search was conducted September 23rd, 2009, via PubMed35 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ ) using simply \"lutein\" as a keyword. This initial search resulted in the finding of 2831 items. Subsequent updated searches have increased this number to 3051. Additionally, on a weekly basis, literature reviews are conducted by Kemin via PubMed and Scopus, using the keywords \"Carotenoids\", \"Lutein\", and \"Zeaxanthin\". From these reviews, articles regarding lutein's role in the body have been compiled in a bibliography contained in Appendix F. 11.2. Why Should the Substance Be Permitted in the Handling of an Organic Product? Unavailability of Organic Alternatives Kemin has reviewed the marketplace and is unaware of any commercially available certified organic lutein products from any source. Th e resources reviewed included information from official organic regulatory programs including USDA's National Organic Program, Canadian Organic Products Regulations, the European Commission Organic Farming legislation, the Japanese Agricultural Organic Standard, as well as organic certifying bodies such as BIOHellas, and BIOSUISSE. A review was also conducted of recognized marketing reports and compilations for the nutritional industry including Frost & Sullivan, Euromonitor, Natural Products Insider, and NutraIngredients. Additionally, general searches were conducted using recognized search engines such as Google. 36 Several lutein products marketed from Chinese based companies were found to use the term \"organic\" on their websites; however, none listed a certifying body establishing that the term \"organic\" was validly supported. While no organically certified lutein products are available, one may consider supplementing foods with an organic form of lutein by using a certified organic lutein-containing vegetable itself, such as spinach. Importantly, spinach represents one of the most highly concentrated sources of lutein in the normal diet with a lutein + zeaxanthin content of 3.7 mg/30 g raw spinach (USDA, 35 PubMed is a search engine for accessing the MEDLINE database of international citations and abstracts of research on the life sciences and biomedical subjects. It is maintained by the United States National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health and is thought to be the most comprehensive and objective resource for searches of this kind. 36 These search activities were conducted by Kemin Industri es, Inc.'s Global Business Intelligence Unit at the direction of Kemin Health, May, 2011. Kemin Health, L.C. 37 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 2010); however, raw spinach, dehydrated spinach, or spinach puree are not practical sources with which to supplement specific types or serving sizes of processed foods. Provided below in Table 11.2.a is the list of the food categories and specific foods to which Kemin's Lutein (USP) may be added based on the GRAS status of these particular food applications, with the GRAS lutein levels being based on the Reference Amounts Customarily Consumed (\"RACCs\"). GRAS status is specif ic to a manufacturer and its manufacturing processes; other suppliers of Lutein (USP) may already have or can assemble the data to affirm GRAS status for these food applications as well as other food applications. Included is a comparison of the amount of Lutein (USP) versus the amounts of both raw/pureed spinach and dehydrated spinach powder necessary to reach the GRAS levels per RACC. The amounts of spinach, spinach puree, or dehydrated spinach powder required to achieve the GRAS levels established for Lutein (USP) are between 600-6000 times higher, and inclusion of any of these spinach products to most of these foods (or other foods for which Lutein (USP) may ultimately be determined to be GRAS) would likely increase the fiber content, impart appearance/color, flavor, and possibly mouth-feel issues, and importantly may also change the organoleptic properties or even affect or change the identity of some foods.

Based on 90% water content, 3.7 mg lutein/30 g spinach becomes 3.7 mg lutein/ 3 g dry spinach, or 0.12mg lutein/100 mg dry spinach. 0.12mg lutein /100mg dry spinach = 10 mg lutein/X mg dry spinach. X calculat es to 8,333 mg, or 8.3 g of dry spinach. Kemin Health, L.C. 42 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 Depending on the baseline lutein content of specific foods and serving sizes, attempts to supplement specific foods with even fractional amounts of lutein using raw spinach, without changing significant characteristics of the food, are not feasible. For example, in order for raw spinach to provide 6 mg of lutein to a 30 g cookie, 50 g of spinach must be added. 50 g is more than the RACC established for a cookie.37 Additionally, raw spinach cannot be added to some specific types of foods, namely beverages, without resulting in obvious visual changes that may be undesirable. Because spinach is composed of approximately 90% water (Davis et al., 2004), a spinach product that may more readily be considered for addition to various foods to increase the lutein content would be a dehydrated spinach powder. Based on the lutein + zeaxanthin amount estimated by USDA (3.7 mg/30 g), a fully dehydrated spinach powder could contain 0.12% of lutein + zeaxanthin by weight. Using another example product to which Lutein may be added, powdered tea, (Table 11.2.a) lutein supplementation of up to 5 mg with Lutein (USP) per RACC (240 mL) is acceptable, requiring 6.8 mg to of Lutein (USP) to reach this level. Alternatively, approximately 4.2 g of dry spinach powder would be required. The amount of dried spinach powder necessary is 600 times higher than the amount of Lutein (USP) required. Moreover, in the case of both liquid and powdered tea, only about 2 g of tea leaves are used in a typical 240 mL serving of initial tea brew. The 4.2 g of dry spinach powder in a tea powder would comprise more of the tea product than the tea components themselves. Benefits for Organic Consumers The marigold-derived lutein contained in Lutein (USP) is the same lutein form contained naturally in other agricultural products consumed as part of the human diet and is also the same form 37 Based on this calculation, a question ma y arise on the suitability of simply consum ing spinach by itself to obtain more lutein. As mentioned in the Introduction, the scientific evi dence supports that the benefits of lutein are realized upon consumption of between 6-10mg of lutein on a daily basis . Using the U.S. Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994 (NHANES III), the Institute of Medicine (IOM) used an expanded carotenoid database for foods reported in NHANES III, to estimate the usual co nsumption of lutein and ze axanthin by the total U.S. population greater than 2 months of age (29,015 individuals). IOM calculated the mean level of lutein most Americans are obtaining from their diet is 1.71 mg (IOM, 2001). Alternatively, Kruger et al. (2002) estimated th e intake of lutein and zeaxanthin using the dietary reco rds for only those respon dents to NHANES III who met their recommended daily intake of vegetables, as described in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and the carotenoid database employed by the IOM. The mean total lutein and zeaxanthin intakes for t hese individuals (5,708 participants, approximately 25% of the total surveyed sample) were 3.83 mg /person/day, respectively. Therefor e, estimated intakes of lutein and zeaxanthin based on recommended levels of vegetable cons umption appear to be greater than twice the estimated actual intakes for the total U.S. population (Kruger et al., 2002). Anecdotally, individua ls identifying themselves as organic consumers may fall within the category of responders in NHANES III who ar e consuming the recommended daily amounts of fruits and vegetables, however even these individuals are unlikely to reach the recommended 6-10 mg of lutein from diet alone. Kemin Health, L.C. 43 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 contained in human breast milk. It is also the form of lutein reported to be ultimately absorbed by the body, when consumed in the esterified form. 38 It is estimated that only half of U.S. infants are exclusively breast fed at birth according to the American Academy of Pediatrics; accordingly, many formula-fed infants may not be ingesting a number of nutrients found in breast milk (Pediatrics, 2005). Because the chemical form of lutein in Lutein (USP) is the same as in human breast milk, FloraGLO Lutein 20% Liquid in optimal source of lutein for use in infant formulas. Parents who select infant formula should have the option to provide their infants with nutritionally complete formulas that include as many of the same nutrients as are contained in human milk. The role of lutein as a beneficial ingredient for inclusion in foods and dietary/food supplements is also of increasing importance because of its protective role in eye and skin health (Section 9.2.4.2.2). The scientific literature reports that the benefits of lutein for eye health, which include its activity as an antioxidant and blue light filter, its role in glare recovery and visual performance, as well as lutein's skin health benefits are realized with regular, daily intake of sufficient levels (reported as between 6-10 mg) of this nutrient that exceed typical dietary exposure levels. Current estimates are that less than one-third of the amount of lutein necessary for health benefits, or approximately 1.71 mg (mean), comes fr om traditional dietary sources (IOM, 2001). Accordingly, lutein intake from Lutein (USP) fortified dietary/food supplements and foods and beverages can help provide the specific eye, skin, antioxidant and other protective benefits demonstrated by scientific evidence. Overall, the inclusion of Lutein (USP) to the National List will allow for the fortification of organic foods and infant formula with a safe, beneficial ingredient that is becoming increasingly recognized for its healthful benefits (Section 9.2.4.2.1 and 9.2.4.2.2), and thereby allow organic consumers the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of lutein without deviating wholly from organic products. 38 Lutein esters ingested from foods or su pplements requires the conversion to free, unesterified lutein in order to be absorbed. This conversion is likely mediated by pancreat ic enzymes such as cholesterol esterase (Breithaup et al., 2002). Kemin Health, L.C. 44 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 12. PETITION JUSTIFICATION STATEMENT 12.1. Justification for Lutein Supplementation of Organically Labeled Products with Lutein (USP) 12.1.1. Provide Comparative Description on Why the Non-Organic Form of the Substance is Necessary for Use in Organic Handling As stated in Section 11.2, Kemin has reviewed the marketplace and is unaware of any commercially available certified organic lutein products from any source. Marigold flowers contain lutein in the form of lutein esters. Marigolds themselves cannot be saponified to efficiently produce large amounts of a significantly pure non-esterified lutein that can be considered a Lutein (USP). Marigolds must undergo further processing with other ingredients to produce marigold oleoresin, a product which can then be saponified to produce lutein material that meets the purity requirements for Lutein (USP). Even if organically certified marigolds were used as the starting material for marigold oleoresin, if the other ingredients used in marigold oleoresin manufacture are not certified organic or appropriately Listed, the product could not be certified organic and could not offer this organic status to a Lutein (USP) product. [Moreover, based on its review, Kemin believes that its dedicated supplier is the only supplier of food grade marigold oleoresin and this supplier is not pursuing an organic certification for that product. As discussed, this limits the eligibility of Lutein (USP) for an organic certification. Kemin is also unaware of the availability of any certified organi c marigold oleoresin of any grade. Therefore, it is unlikely that Kemin or other Lutein (USP) suppliers would be able to consider an organic status for this ingredient until or unless a supply of certified organic marigold oleoresin is available. ] 39 CBI Deleted Also, as discussed in Section 12.1.2, while lutein can be produced from other sources which could potentially be organic, these sources present significant commercial impracticability and quality issues. 12.1.2. Current and Historical Industry Information/Research/Evidence That Explains Why the Substance Cannot Be Obtained Organically 12.1.2.1. Appropriate Form Lutein (USP), in its overall finished form, is unique for its high purity (74%) of the same lutein molecule consumed as part of the human diet, and low impurity content. Marigolds, while a preferred agricultural source because of the general abundance of the lutein pigment in the flower, are not the only source of non-esterified lutein. Free lutein can be obtained from 39 Brackets indicate Confidential Busine ss Information (\"CBI\"). Kemin Health, L.C. 45 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 extraction of table foods such as spinach, and also from green algae. However, issues with the types of materials and processing steps needed to extract the free lutein, as well as the low yield of free lutein from these sources, preclude them from being practical. These issues are detailed in the following subsections. 12.1.2.2. Appropriate Quality As discussed more fully in the next section, extraction of free lutein from other certified organic foods such as spinach requires more processing and solvents than extraction from marigolds, and would likely yield a product with less free lutein than Lutein (USP). Lutein from spinach would therefore be more likely to be a more impure final product. Lutein may also be obtained from microalgae, but again, the free lutein purity is low as compared to Lutein (USP). While these lower purities may or may not translate into less safe products, in terms of commercial perception of quality, a lower purity non-esterified lutein is less desirable because of the potential for the presence of unknown and/or undesirable impurities that would necessarily accompany the lutein component of the ingredient. 12.1.2.3. Appropriate Quantity to Fulfill an Essential Function in a System of Organic Handling While it may be considered that, due to a relatively high level of non-esterified lutein contained in some dietary foods such as spinach (which may be certified organic), extraction of \"free\" lutein from such a source would be feasible. Kemin has previously investigated this option and there are several reasons why this is not the case. Spinach and other table foods as raw materials are much more expensive than marigolds. Also, the dietary or free lutein contained in spinach is significantly bound in the plant material and is present with various other carotenoids from which it must be separated. In order to adequately isolate lutein from spinach, simple extraction is insufficient. Spinach must be dehydrated, the spinach plant cell matrix disrupted, and generally a solvent separation of the chlorophyll containing fraction is necessary prior to another solvent separation step to isolate lutein from other contained carotenoids such as beta-carotene. Moreover, the lutein content in one cup of spinach (30 g) is estimated, combined with zeaxanthin to be approximately 3.7 mg (USDA, 2010). A theoretical extraction ratio of spinach (assuming all lutein + zeaxanthin [L + Z] could be obtained) would be 123 mg (L + Z)/kg spinach. [Kemin's Lutein (USP) process provides, at minimum, 740 g of non-esterified lutein (exclusive of zeaxanthin) from approximately 100 kg of dried marigold flowers, with a resulting extraction ratio of approximately 7.4 g/kg, or alternatively 7.4 mg/g. ] Comparatively, marigold flowers provide high lutein yields, are not subject to interferences from chlorophyll, and also do not contain significant levels of other carotenoids. CBI Deleted Also, the use of additional or increased amounts of solvents in spinach extraction may have a potential negative impact on both the product and the environment. Assuming a high water Kemin Health, L.C. 46 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 content in spinach nearing 90% (Davis et al., 2004), it is likely that significant measures to remove the excess moisture would also be necessary. [The initial cost of using a \"table\" vegetable such as spinach as a lutein source, coupled with the extra processing steps and lower potential yield raise the cost of lutein production by 10 times.40] Additionally, there is increased potential for impurities, and the use of additional solvents required to isolate lutein from these types of green vegetables is likely to result in a greater environmental impact. Taken together, these issues establish obtaining lutein from spinach, or another similar type food, as less desirable than obtaining lutein from marigolds. CBI Deleted Lutein is also known to be present in green algae; however Kemin has not identified any algal- derived products currently marketed as \"lutein\". Kemin is unaware of any algal-processes that could produce a lutein product containing the same level of non-esterified lutein as contained in Lutein (USP), and experts have stated that microbial sources cannot compete with marigold flower as a source of lutein (Dufosse, 2009), supporting Kemin's findings. Currently, in terms of marketed algal-derived carotenoids, the most notable is beta-carotene, with a product called Betatene \u00ae being the most prominently known. Betatene is a mixed carotenoid product obtained from the salinas . lutein, is beta-carotene. Lutein, in a 30% Betatene product, only comprises 1500 or 0.15% of the Betatene composition. 41 Lutein (USP) contains, at minimum, 74% lutein, with commercial forms of Lutein (USP) products offering 5-20% lutein. When compared to Lutein (USP) products, Betatene could not be considered to provide a significant source of purified lutein, supporting that algal sources do not offer a viable source for this material. 12.1.3. Describe Industry Information on Substance Non-availability of Organic Sources, Including But Not Limited to, the Following Guidance Regarding Commercial Availability Evaluation Criteria 12.1.3.1. Regions of Production, Including Factors Such as Climate and Number of Regions Kemin manufactures its Lutein (USP) in the United States. Lutein products are manufactured in several countries worldwide. Climate and climate changes do not generally affect actual lutein 40 Kemin internal memo, March, 2011 (Appendix G). 41 Carotenoids.

The majority of commercially available lutein is obtained from marigolds and 75% of marigolds intended for production into marigold oleoresin, both food and feed grade, are grown in China. The remaining growing regions for this type of marigold are India, Thailand, and a few South American countries. [Marigolds intended for the food grade marigold oleoresin purchased by Kemin are currently only grown in India and Thailand, and this is also the location of the only company believed to be producing the food grade marigold oleoresin that is sold exclusively to Kemin. ] CBI Deleted 12.1.3.2. Number of Suppliers and Amount Produced In addition to Kemin (in partnership with DSM), there are approximately 10 other lutein suppliers. [In 2011, the human lutein market globally, for non-esterified lutein, is estimated by Kemin and other sources to be approximately 35.1 metric tons, with the North American market estimate being 19.1 metric tons.42] CBI Deleted 12.1.3.3. Current and Historical Supplies Related to Weather Events Such as Hurricanes, Floods, and Droughts That May Temporarily Halt Production or Destroy Crops or Supplies Adverse or erratic weather patterns do affect marigold crops intended for marigold oleoresin production. Recently in China, there have been reports of erratic frost and rain conditions adversely affecting marigold crops and causing a shortage of marigold flowers for use in the production of feed grade marigold oleoresin. As China is the largest growing region of marigolds for use in this feed grade product, this does affect the global supply of feed grade marigold oleoresin. Because other producers may use feed grade oleoresin as their starting material for food grade lutein, this does affect the global supply of lutein for human use. CBI Deleted[Kemin purchases food grade marigold oleoresin from its supplier using multi-year and long-term contracts, and they in turn contract with growers in India and Thailand. Kemin's vendor also has the ability to contract with growers in China to produce food grade marigolds should cultivation in a new growing area be necessary or desirable .] [42 Kemin calculated these numbers based on estimates from data obtained from Frost & Sullivan report \"U.S. Eye Health Ingredients Market\", with additio nal market information from customers. ] CBI Deleted Kemin Health, L.C. 48 Lutein (USP) CBI Deleted Copy NOP Petition September 2011 K emin Health, L.C. 49 12.1.3.4.

Court Avenue, Suite A Des Moines, IA 50309-2021 Re: GRAS Notice No. GRN 000221 Dear Ms. Trinker: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responding to the notice, dated April 4, 2007, that you submitted in accordance with the agency's proposed regulation, proposed 21 CFR 170.36 (62 FR 18938; April 17, 1997; Substances Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS); the GRAS proposal). FDA received the notice on April 9, 2007, filed it on April 11, 2007, and designated it as GRAS Notice No. GRN 000221. The subject of the notice is suspended lutein. The notice informs FDA of the view of Kemin Health L.C. (Kemin) that suspended lutein is GRAS, through scientific procedures, for use as an ingredient in term infant formula at a maximum level of 250 micrograms per liter ( \u0001g/l). In this letter the term \"suspended lutein\" denotes mixture of the carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin (crystalline lutein) that are suspended in safflower oil. 21 CFR 101.4 states that all ingredients must be declared by their common or usual name. In addition, 21 CFR 102.5 outlines general principals to use when establishing common or usual names for nonstandarized foods. Our use of \"suspended lutein\" in this letter should not be considered an endorsement or recommendation of that term as an appropriate common or usual name for the purpose of declaring the substance in the ingredient statement of foods that Issues associated with labeling and the appropriate common or usual name of a food are the responsibility of the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements in the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. As part of GRN 000221, Kemin includes the report of a panel of individuals (Kemin's GRAS panel) who evaluated the data and information that are the basis for Kemin's GRAS determination. Kemin considers the members of its GRAS panel to be qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety of substances added to food. Kemin's GRAS panel evaluated estimates of dietary exposure, method of production, and product specifications as well as published and unpublished studies. Based on this review, Kemin's GRAS panel concluded that suspended lutein that meets appropriate food grade specifications and is manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practices is GRAS under the conditions of its intended use. Crystalline lutein was the subject of GRN 000140 and is incorporated by reference into GRN 000221. The notified substance in GRN 000221 is a safflower oil suspension of crystalline lutein. GRN 000140 includes the identity and composition of, as well as, the method of manufacture of crystalline lutein. GRN 000221 discusses the identity, composition, and method of manufacture of suspended lutein. Kemin reports that the main components of suspended lutein are at least 21 percent lutein by weight and at least 0.8 per cent zeaxanthin by weight and provides specifications for this ingredient. In GRN 000221, Kemin describes the use of suspended lutein in term infant formula at levels not to exceed 250 \u0001g/l, which Kemin notes is equivalent to 37 micrograms per 100 kilocalories. Kemin estimates the mean and 90th percentile intake of dietary carotenoids for children from 2 through 6 months to be 200 and 820 micrograms per day ( \u0001g/d) respectively, and for children between 7 months to 11 months of age to be 460 and 1,100 \u0001g/d, respectively. For the use in term infant formula, as described in GRN 000221, Kemin estimates a daily intake of 195 \u0001g/d of suspended lutein. GRN 000221 discusses published and unpublished studies in GRN 000140, as well as several published animal studies that became available after the agency review of GRN 000140, and two unpublished growth studies conducted in healthy term infants. Kemin concludes that the growth studies provide corroborative evidence for the safety of suspended lutein. In GRN 000221, Kemin describes the crystalline lutein use of suspended lutein in food products may constitute the use of a color additive under section 201(t)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) and FDA's implementing regulations in 21 CFR Part 70. During the review of GRN 000221, FDA requested that Kemin present its view on whether the intended use of suspended lutein would be exempt from the definition of color additive. In an amendment to GRN 000221, dated September 4, 2007, Kemin presented its reasons for concluding that the intended use of suspended lutein would be exempt from the definition of color additive under section 201(t) of the FFDCA and FDA's implementing regulations in 21 CFR 70.3 (f) and (g). Importantly, if the use of suspended lutein constitutes use as a color additive within the meaning of section 201(t)(1) of the FFDCA and FDA's implementing regulations in 21 CFR 70.3(f) and (g), section 721(a) of the FFDCA requires premarket review and approval of that use by FDA. Under section 412 of the FFDCA, a manufacturer of a new infant formula must make a submission to FDA, providing required assurances about the formula, at least 90 days before the formula is marketed. Kemin should be aware that FDA's response to Kemin's GRAS notice does not alleviate the responsibility of any infant formula manufacturer who intends to market an infant formula that contains suspended lutein to make the submission required by section 412. Based on the information provided by Kemin, as well as other information available to FDA, the agency has no questions at this time regarding Kemin's conclusion that suspended lutein is GRAS under the intended conditions of use. The agency has not, however, made its own determination regarding the GRAS status of the subject use of suspended lutein. As always, it is the continuing responsibility of Kemin to ensure that food ingredients that the firm markets are safe, and are otherwise in compliance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. In accordance with proposed 21 CFR 170.36(f), a copy of the text of this letter responding to GRN 000221, as well as a copy of the information in this notice that conforms to the information in the proposed GRAS exemption claim (proposed 21 CFR 170.36(c)(1)), is available for public review and copying on the homepage of the Office of Food Additive Safety (on the Internet at http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/foodadd.html ).

In its statement of December 19, 2002, the AFSSA had considered that the two following claims: \u00ab contributes to eye health\" and \u00ab contributes to good ocular functioning\" were not scientiphically supported by the petitioner. This statement wa s justified by an insufficient level of proof supporting the proposed claims as well as by the absence of any interventional study demonstrating the effects of the product cons umption at the proposed dose, for the aimed population. Based on the same technical dossier, the petitioner submits four new claims. After consultation of the expert committee specia lized in human nutrition on November 20, 2003, the AFSSA made the following statement: Considering that lutein is a pigment belonging to th e carotenoid's family, found in the retina, that it is highly concentrated in the central part of the retina called macula where it works as a blue light filter and probably as an antioxidant, that this hy pothesis is highly reinforc ed by the presence into the retina of lutein metabolites coming from lutein oxidation, that, moreover, these pigments are not synthesized by the human body, that it has been shown that their dietary intake is indispensable for macular pigment constitution, Considering that the lens is a transparent membrane located in the front part of the eye; that the lens' structure is mainly proteinic, that the catara ct is a disease linked to clouding of the lens; that this clouding results from oxidative modification s of lens structure proteins, that the main antioxidants found in the lens are: ascorbate, glutathion, tocoph\u00e9rols and carot\u00e9no\u00efds; that among these last category, we can find essentially lutein and z\u00e9axanthin; that these substances act by lysis of the denature proteins, responsible for the lens transparency diminution. Considering the scientiphic arguments in favor of the lutein antioxidant role in the retina and the lens, that, furtherm ore a study has shown the existence of an inve rsed relation between the macular pigment density and the lens density, the claim \u00ab lutein helps protect the retina and the lens from the oxidation\" is scientiphically justified. Considering that the petitioner is demanding the following claim: \"lutein strength ens the protection of the retina and the lens from the oxidation\", that a so called reinforcement implies the demonstration that lutein consumption leads to the protection mechanism fortification or the reparation of the retina and lens in front of the damages due to the oxidativ e stress, that the study AREDS (Age Related Disease Study) showed that a supplementation in antioxidant micronutrients (vitamin C and E, carotene and zinc) at supra-nutritional doses permitted a 25% reduction of the AMD (Age Related Macular Disease) incidence in people with a particular form of AMD with macular drusens. Considering that results on lens density or cataract formation from studies performed with various antioxidant s do not allow the confirmation of thes e hypothesis, that thes e studies conclusions mentioned in particular that \"specific responsible nutrients (of the cataract action) are not determined today and the non evaluated different ways of life between those that have been taken vitamin supplements and those that have not, could give the explanation for the results (of the study) (1) and that the inverse relation betwe en the lens and the macular pigment optical densities suggests that lutein and zeaxanthin c ould delay the lens aging (2), that, thus, peer- reviewed articles presented by the petitioner did not scientiphically establish the effects of lutein supplementation on the protection of lens and retina from the oxidation, at the proposed dose, for the adult target population (excluding pregnant and breast-feeding women) Considering that in the claims: \"Lutein is one of the m ajor constituents of the retina and lens\" and \"lutein, major constituent of the retina and lens, contribute to protect the retina and the lens from oxidation\", the word \"major\" can at the same time imply a quantitative superiority and the very important (even the most important\") role of the lutein in the retina and the lens, that lutein's concentrations in the lens are quite low in front of those of the proteins co nstituting 98% of the dry mass of the lens, that, moreover, the possible superiority of the lutein antioxidant capacity compared to others substances such as asco rbate, vitamin E has not been demonstrated, consequently, the use of the word: \"major\" into these two claims is excessive, thus the word \"major\" should be delete and the claims reformulat ed on the following way: \"lutein is one (of the) constituent(s) of the retina and the lens\". The AFSSA - Claim s: \u00ab Lutein ns protection from oxidation \u00bb \u00ab Lutein is one of the major constituents of the retina and the lens \u00bb \u00ab Lutein, major constituent of the retina and the l ens, helps protect the retina and the lens from the oxidation \u00bb are not scientiphically established. - Claim s: \u00ab protect the retina and lens from oxidation \u00bb \u00abLutein is one (of the) constituent (s) of the retina a nd the lens\u00bb are justified Martin Hirsch 1 Mares-Perlman JA et al.

The final product, after saponification, contains, as a major component, lutein and a smaller proportion of zeaxanthin. Lutein (3R,3'R,6'R- EH-carotene-3,3'-diol) is a member of a group of pigments known as xanthophylls and has no provitamin A activity. Lutein from Tagetes erecta L. has not previously been evaluated by JECFA although xanthophylls, of which lutein is a member, were considered at the 31st JECFA (1987). Commercial xanthophyll preparations (Tagetes extract) were again considered at the 55th JECFA and tentative specifications were published in FNP 52 Add 8 (2000) and were superseded by specifications published in FNP 52 Add 9 (2001) following the 57th JECFA (2001). It is used as a food colouring agent and nutrient supplement (food additive) in a wide range of baked goods and baking mixes, beverages and beverage bases, breakfast cereals, chewing gum, dairy product analogs, egg products, fats and oils, frozen dairy desserts and mixes, gravies and sauces, soft and hard candy, infant and toddler foods, milk products, processed fruits and fruit juices, soups and soup mixes in levels ranging from 2 to 330 mg/kg. Specifications for lutein were prepared at the 63rd JECFA and published in FNP 52 Add 12 (2004). 2 Description 2.1 Chemistry and nature of the product Lutein is an oxycarotenoid, or xanthophyll, (synonyms: - lutein; 4',5'-didehydro-5',6'-dihydro-beta,beta-carotene-3,3'-diol) containing 2 cyclic end groups (one beta - and one alpha -ionone ring) and the basic C40 isoprenoid structure common to all carotenoids (see Figure 1). Although the polyene chain double bonds present in lutein could exist in a cis or trans conformation, giving rise to a large number of possible mono- cis and poly- cis isomers, the vast majority of carotenoids are in the all-trans configurations (Rice-Evans et al. , 1997; IOM, 2000), as depicted in Figure 1. Lutein has been assigned Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number 127-40-2 with a chemical formula of C 40H5602 and a molecular weight of 568.88. Extracts of marigold flowers, fresh raw kale, corn meal, spinach, and human plasma also contain small amounts of cis isomers of lutein (Krinsky et al. , 1990; Khachik is commonly isolated from marigold oleoresin together with zeaxanthin. Figure 1. Structural formula of lutein Chemical and Technical Assessment Lutein from Tagetes erecta 63rd JECFA 2 (5) 3 Manufacturing 3.1 Manufacturing Principle Lutein from Tagetes erecta L. is produced from marigold oleoresin. The marigold extracted from and from the oleoresin by saponification and crystallisation. Other raw materials used in the manufacturing process are potassium hydroxide, methanol or propylene glycol. 3.2 Detailed Description The Committee received details of two separate manufacturing processes. The differences in the processes are in the method of saponification and crystallization. Both approaches have been incorporated into the CTA. The preparation of the marigold oleoresin from marigold flowers relies on the extraction of xanthophylls from the natural source material with hexane and does not include chemical synthesis. Lutein is prepared from the oleoresin by saponification and crystallization. Under saponification conditions, fatty removed from lutein esters and zeaxanthin esters. This process employs mixing and heating and the reactions use potassium hydroxide, methanol or propylene glycol and water. During these processes crystals of lutein are formed. The reaction mixture from the crystallization step is then diluted with water and the resulting crystals are dried by the removal of the residual water. 4 Chemical Characterization 4.1 Composition of lutein Lutein prepared in this manner contains more than 80% total carotenoids of which lutein is present at 70 - 78 %. Zeaxanthin (2 - 9%) and other carotenoids are also present. Waxes (14%) and fatty acids (1%), present in the unprocessed oleoresin, make up the balance of the material. 4.2 Physico-chemical properties Lutein is a free-flowing orange-red powder. It is insoluble in water but it is soluble in hexane. 4.3 Possible Impurities (including degradation products) Based on the information received, hexane and propylene glycol and methanol may be present at low levels following the oleoresin preparation and subsequent saponification step. 4.4 Analytical Methods The analytical methods employed are found in FNP 5, the standards of other respected organizations, journal references and were developed in-house. 4.5 Rationale for Proposed Specifications The specifications are based on the manufacturing process and raw materials to define the composition of the crystalline material. Furthermore, the specifications have been produced to differentiate this material from the specification for Tagetes extract (FNP 52 Add 9 (2001). These specifications include some of the parameters of lutein tested and identified above. The purity assay is designed to identify the levels of lutein and total carotenoids within the final product. Batches containing less than 70.0% lutein would not meet specifications. Furthermore, the extraction solvents hexane, methanol and propylene glycol are included in the specifications to ensure residual levels of these are kept to a minimum. Ash, moisture and waxes are included since they form the major non-carotenoid portion of the final crystalline lutein product. Lead is included in the specification for safety purposes, since high levels of the metal could have toxicity Chemical and Technical Assessment Lutein from Tagetes erecta 63rd JECFA 3 (5) implications. In addition, analytical data from several different manufacturing lots of lutein indicate that the methods of production give rise to a consistent product. The data supplied also support the proposed specifications, and suggest that the finished product produced by the manufacturing processes described is well within the product specifications. 5 Functional Use 5.1 Technological Function Lutein is intended for use as a colouring agent and a nutrient supplement. 5.2 Food Categories and Use Levels Lutein is used as a colouring agent in foods such as baked goods and baking mixes, beverages and beverage bases, breakfast cereals, chewing gum, dairy product analogs, egg products, fats and oils, frozen dairy desserts and mixes, gravies and sauces, hard candy, infant and toddler foods (other than infant formula), milk products, processed fruits and fruit juices, soft candy, and soups and soup mixes. The intended food uses and use levels (2.0 -330 mg/kg) are presented in Appendix 1. 6 Reactions and Fate in Foods Stability testing performed on the lutein products in commerce indicated that they are stable at room temperature for a period of 12 months. Stability testing also was performed on lutein in various food products, including pasta sauce, cereal bars and baked, ready-to-eat cereal, which showed that they are stable at room temperature for a period of 12 months. Lutein is not anticipated to react with other components of the food matrix or with environmental constituents. 7 References FAO (1991) Guide to Specifications.
