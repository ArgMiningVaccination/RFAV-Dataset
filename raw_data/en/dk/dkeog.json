In mice and non-human primates, our original RBD vaccine induced high neutralizing antibody titers against the wild-type (WT) isolate of the virus, and, with partners in India and Indonesia it was later developed into two closely resembling human vaccines, Corbevax and Indovac, respectively. Here, we describe the development and characterization of a next-generation vaccine adapted to the recently emerging XBB variants of SARS-CoV-2. (2) Methods: We conducted preclinical studies mice using a novel yeast-produced SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.5 RBD subunit vaccine candidate formulated with alum and CpG. We examined the neutralization profile of sera obtained from mice vaccinated twice intramuscularly at a 21-day interval with the XBB.1.5-based RBD/CpG/alum vaccine induced a robust production of antibodies in mice that demonstrated strong neutralization of the XBB.1.5 pseudovirus and multiple other Omicron pseudoviruses. However, regardless of high antibody cross-reactivity by ELISA, the anti-XBB.1.5 RBD antigen serum showed low neutralizing titers against the WT and Delta virus variants. (4) Conclusions: Whereas we observed modest cross-neutralization against Omicron subvariants by sera from mice vaccinated with the original RBD/CpG/Alum vaccine or with the BA.4/5-based vaccine, sera raised against the XBB.1.5 RBD showed robust cross-neutralization. These findings underscore the opportunity for an updated vaccine formulation utilizing the XBB.1.5 RBD antigen. [Thyroid Eye Disease as Initial Manifestation of Graves' Disease Following Viral Vector SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine\u2014Report of A Case and Review of the Literature (preprint)](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/ppzbmed-10.20944.preprints202309.0141.v1) ABSTRACT COVID-19, a contagious disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, emerged in 2019 and quickly became a pandemic, infecting more than 700 million people worldwide. The disease incidence, morbidity and mortality rates have started to decline since the development of effective vaccines against the virus and the widespread immunization of the population. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are associated with minor local or systemic adverse reactions, while serious adverse effects are rare. Thyroid-related disorders have been reported after vaccination for COVID-19, and Graves' disease (GD) is the second most common amongst them. Thyroid eye disease (TED), an extrathyroidal manifestation of GD is rarely observed post COVID-19 vaccination. All TED cases followed mRNA-based vaccinations, but two new onset mild TED cases post viral vector vaccine (ChAdox1nCoV-19) have also been reported. We report the case of a 63-year-old woman who presented with new onset hyperthyroidism and moderate-to-severe and active TED ten days after she received the first dose of a viral vector vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. This is the first case of moderate-to-severe TED after such a vaccine. Our patient was initially treated with intravenous glucocorticoids and subsequently with intravenous rituximab, due to no response. The disease was rendered inactive after rituximab, but constant diplopia persisted, and the patient rehabilitative [Hyperthyroidism](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"Hyperthyroidism\"), with SARS-CoV-2 during Pregnancy\u2014A Qualitative Study (preprint)](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/ppzbmed-10.20944.preprints202309.0182.v1) ABSTRACT Pregnant women have been considered a high-risk group for SARS-CoV-2 infection; the impact of the disease on the health of a mother and her child is still being studied. The emotional impact of the pandemic on pregnant women has been extensively studied. Emotional distress is proposed as a perspective to explain the emotional manifestations of women during this stage as something common rather than pathological. The objective of this study was to know the emotional experience of women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 towards the end of their pregnancy, during the first and second waves of COVID in Mexico. A qualitative study was carried out: 18 pregnant women with COVID were interviewed. A thematic analysis of the data was performed, resulting in three main themes and 14 subthemes. The COVID-infected mothers-to-be experienced mild to moderate emotional distress. It was more intense for those with comorbidities. This distress was aggravated during obstetrical complications and comorbidities, as well as during COVID and postpartum. The emotional distress was appeased by both the perception of medical care and social support. The emotional distress of pregnant women with COVID requires emotional accompaniment to reduce its impact.

In this study, we used deep unsupervised learning methods to identify and characterize TCR specificity. Our research focused on developing and applying state-of-the-art modelling techniques, including AutoEncoders, Variational AutoEncoders and transfer learning with Transformers, to analyze TCR data. Through our experiments and analyses, we have achieved promising results in identifying TCR patterns and understanding TCR specificity for Sars-Cov-2. The insights gained from our research provide valuable tools and knowledge for interpreting the immunological response to the virus, ultimately contributing to the development of effective vaccines and treatments against the viral infection. ABSTRACT The continued evolution of SARS-CoV-2 may lead to evasion of vaccine immunity and natural immunity. A highly mutated Omicron variant BA.2.86 has recently been identified with over 30 amino acid changes in Spike compared with BA.2 and XBB.1.5. As of September 4, 2023, BA.2.86 has been identified in 37 sequences from 10 countries, which is likely an underestimate due to limited surveillance. The ability of BA.2.86 to evade NAbs compared with other currently circulating Omicron variants remains unknown. Our data show that NAb responses to BA.2.86 were lower than to BA.2 but were comparable or slightly higher than to the current circulating recombinant variants XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16, EG.5, EG.5.1, expansion with upregulated transposable elements in severe COVID-19 unveiled in single-cell RNA sequencing reanalysis (preprint)](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/ppzbmed-10.1101.2023.09.04.556192) ABSTRACT Some studies investigated the potential role of transposable elements (TEs) in COVID-19 pathogenesis and complications. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study to examine the possible association of TEs expression in cell functions and its potential role in COVID-19 immune response at the single-cell level. In this study, we reanalyzed single-cell RNA seq data of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples obtained from six severe COVID-19 patients and three healthy donors to assess the probable correlation of TE expression with the immune responses induced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in COVID-19 patients. Our findings indicated that the expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs (may be a characteristic feature of COVID-19. Additionally, a significant increase in TEs expression in MDSCs was observed. This upregulation of TEs in COVID-19 may be linked to the adaptability of these cells in response to their microenvironments. Furthermore, it appears that the identification of overexpressed TEs by Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in MDSCs may enhance the suppressive capacity of these cells. Thus, this study emphasizes the crucial role of TEs in the functionality of MDSCs during COVID-19.

Real-time RT-PCR and other nucleic acid amplification techniques are accurate and sensitive molecular techniques that necessitate positive controls. To meet this need, Twist Bioscience has developed and released synthetic RNA controls. However, RNA is an inherently unstable molecule needing cold storage and costly shipping and resource-intensive logistics. Imagene provides a solution to this problem by encapsulating dehydrated RNA inside metallic capsules filled with anhydrous argon, allowing room temperature and eco-friendly storage and shipping. Here, RNA controls produced by Twist were encapsulated (RNAshells) and distributed to several laboratories that used them for COVID-19 detection tests by amplification. One RT-LAMP procedure, four different RT-PCR devices and 6 different PCR kits were used. The amplification targets were genes E, N; RdRp, Sarbeco-E and Orf1a/b. RNA retrieval was satisfactory, and the detection was reproducible. RNA stability was checked by accelerated aging. The results for a 10-year equivalent storage time at 25C were not significantly different from those for unaged samples. This room temperature RNA stability is a great advantage because it allows the preparation and the distribution of large strategic batches which can be kept for a long time and used for standardization processes between detection sites. Moreover, it makes it possible also to use these controls as single use and in the field where large differences in temperature can occur. In conclusion, these encapsulated RNA controls processed at room temperature can be used as reference materials for SARS-Cov-2 virus and other pathogen detection.

Current studies have been first carried out using microsecond ensemble equilibrium all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Due to slow conformational changes (from the open to closed) accompanying nucleotide insertion and selection, enhanced or umbrella sampling methods have been further employed to calculate free energy profiles of the non-cognate NTP insertion. Our studies show notable stability of noncognate dATP and GTP upon initial binding in the active-site open state. The results indicate that while natural cognate ATP and Remdesivir drug analogue (RDV-TP) are biased to be stabilized in the closed or insertion state, the natural non-cognate dATP and GTP can be well trapped in off-path initial binding configurations. Current work thus presents an intrinsic nucleotide selectivity mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp for natural substrate fidelity control in viral genome replication.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can alter the leukocyte phenotype based on disease severity, including neutrophil activation in severe cases. However, the plasticity of neutrophil phenotypes and their relative impact on COVID-19 pathogenesis has not been well addressed. This study aimed to identify and validate the heterogeneity of neutrophils in COVID-19 and evaluate the phenotypic alterations for each subpopulation. Methods: We analyzed public single-cell RNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, and human plasma proteome data from healthy donors and patients with COVID-19 to investigate neutrophil subpopulations and their response to disease pathogenesis. Results: We identified eight neutrophil subtypes, namely C1-C8, and found that they exhibited distinct features, including activation signatures and multiple enriched pathways. The neutrophil subtype C4 (DEFA1/1B/3+) associated with severe and fatal disease. Bulk RNA-seq and proteome dataset analyses using a cellular deconvolution approach validated the relative abundances of neutrophil subtypes and the expansion of C4 (DEFA1/1B/3+) in severe COVID-19 patients. Cell-cell communication analysis revealed representative ligand-receptor interactions among the identified neutrophil subtypes. Notably, the C4 (DEFA1/1B/3+) fraction showed transmembrane receptor expression of CD45 and CAP1 as well as the secretion of pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP). We further demonstrated the clinical potential of PPBP as a novel diagnostic biomarker for severe COVID-19. Conclusion: Our work has great value in terms of both clinical and public health as it furthers our understanding of the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity of neutrophils and other cell Infections\"), new SARS-CoV-2 variant, designated BA.2.86, has recently emerged with over 30 spike mutations relative to its parental BA.2, raising questions about its degree of resistance to neutralising antibodies. Using a spike-pseudotyped virus model we characterise neutralisation of BA.2.86 by clinically relevant monoclonal antibodies and by two cohorts of serum sampled from Stockholm, including both a recent cohort, and one sampled prior to the arrival of XBB in Sweden. ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has had a significant impact on global health and economy. Despite the availability of vaccines, their limited accessibility and vaccine hesitancy pose challenges in controlling the spread of the disease. Effective therapeutic strategies, including antiviral drugs, are needed to combat the future spread of new SARSCoV- 2 virus variants. The main protease (Mpro) is a critical therapeutic target for COVID-19 medicines, as its inhibition impairs viral replication. However, the use of substances that inhibit Mpro may induce selection pressure. Thus, it is vital to monitor viral resistance to known drugs and to develop new drugs. Here we have developed a yeast system for the identification of Mpro inhibitors as an alternative to costly and demanding high biosecurity procedures. The system is based on stable expression of Mpro and does not require selection media. Yeast can be cultured on a rich carbon source, providing rapid growth and screening results. The designed tool was subsequently used to screen the FDA-Approved Drug Library. Several chemicals with Mpro inhibitory properties were identified. We found that meisoindigo not previously known for its potential to inhibit Mpro, was highly effective. Our results may promote development of new derivatives with therapeutic properties against SARS-CoV-2 and other beta-coronaviruses. Subject(s) [COVID-19](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"COVID-19\") ABSTRACT The recently identified SARS-CoV-2 variant, BA.2.86, which carries a substantial number of Spike mutations, has raised a global alarm. An immediate assessment of its antigenic properties and infectivity is necessary. Here, we reveal the distinct antigenicity of BA.2.86 compared with previous variants including XBB.1.5. BA.2.86 significantly evades convalescent plasma from XBB breakthrough infection (BTI) and reinfections. Key mutations that mediate the enhanced resistance include N450D, K356T, L452W, A484K, V483del, and NTD mutations and E554K on SD1 also largely contribute. However, we found that BA.2.86 pseudovirus exhibits compromised efficiency of infecting HEK293T-hACE2 cells compared to XBB.1.5 and EG.5, which may be caused by K356T, V483del, and E554K, and could potentially limit BA.2.86\\'s transmissibility. In sum, it appears that BA.2.86 has traded its infectivity for higher immune evasion during long-term host-viral evolution. Close attention should be paid to monitoring additional mutations that could improve Omicron EG.5 and EG.5.1 are surging in several areas of the world, including China. Compared with XBB.1, EG.5 contains additional mutations of F456L and S486P in the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and its subvariant EG.5.1 carries a further spike mutation Q52H. The immune escape potential of EG.5/EG.5.1 is of great concern. In this study, we evaluated the neutralization activities of sera from participants who received COVID-19 inactivated vaccines, protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 or a booster vaccination of Delta-BA.5 RBD-heterodimer protein vaccine, and participants who had a breakthrough infection during a wave of BF.7/BA.5.2 circulation in December 2022. Neutralization profiles elicited by bivalent RBD-heterodimer vaccine candidates containing XBB.1.5 antigen were evaluated in a murine model. We found that EG.5 and EG.5.1 displayed similar immune evasion potential to XBB.1 and XBB.1.5. The Delta-BA.5 RBD-heterodimer booster induced tested XBB subvariants, including EG.5 and EG.5.1, than breakthrough infection or BA.5.2. In addition, Delta-XBB.1.5 and BQ.1.1-XBB.1.5 RBD-heterodimer vaccines high neutralizing activities against XBB sub-variants in a murine model, suggesting that next-generation COVID-19 vaccines with updated components must be developed to enhance the protection efficacy against the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains.

A growing number of reports have documented associations between COVID-19 vaccination and autoimmunity, suggesting, for example, a causal link between vaccination and new-onset and/or relapsing autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Graves disease, and Hashimoto s thyroiditis. These autoimmune phenomena have occurred with various COVID-19 vaccines and research is required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and causal directions, for example, whether persons with no history of autoimmune disorders may experience them upon vaccination or persons with autoimmune disorders may experience exacerbation or new adverse events post-vaccination. Methods and analysis - Specific objectives of this scoping review will address the following questions: Can COVID-19 vaccination trigger and/or exacerbate autoimmune disorders? Are persons with autoimmune disorders at higher risk of experiencing additional autoimmune disorders? What are the mechanisms connecting autoimmune disorders with COVID-19 vaccination? Can COVID-19 vaccination interact with immunosuppressive therapy in persons with autoimmune disorders? Does the risk of autoimmune disorders following COVID-19 vaccination differ by vaccine type, age, gender, or other still unidentified characteristics (e.g., SES)? What is the consensus of care concerning COVID-19 vaccination in persons with autoimmune disorders and what evidence informs it? Our review will follow Arksey and O Malley s (2005) framework, enhanced by Levac et al. s team-based approach (2010), and adhering to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) Checklist. To capture the broadest range of perspectives on the phenomenon of interest, data will be synthesized through numerical summaries describing general characteristics of included studies and thematic analysis. Subgroup analysis of primary outcomes will be performed to compare findings according to 1) the previous existence of autoimmune disorder, 2) the presence of relevant co-morbidities, 3) vaccine type; and other relevant factors that we may encounter as the research proceeds. Significance - COVID-19 has triggered the largest vaccination campaign in history, targeting literally the global human community. Drug safety is a crucial aspect of any medical intervention, critical to a proper assessment of the balance of risks and benefits. Our investigation should yield information useful to improve medical and public health practice in multiple ways, including assisting in clinical decision-making, policy development, and ethical of action are needed for COVID 19 treatment; remdesivir is mainly used in hospitalized patients, but additional antivirals are needed in this setting. Ensitrelvir, a 3C like protease inhibitor, received emergency approval in Japan in November 2022, based on evidence of rapid symptom resolution in nonhospitalized patients, but confirmation of its efficacy in hospitalized patients is lacking. Case presentations: This case series reports outcomes for all patients who received ensitrelvir whilst hospitalized with SARS CoV 2 infection at Rinku General Medical Center, Japan (November 2022 to April 2023). Thirty two hospitalized patients received five days of ensitrelvir treatment (375/125 mg). Mean age was 73.5 years and most patients had mild COVID 19. Patients exhibited various underlying diseases, most commonly hypertension (78.1%) and chronic kidney disease (25.0%). Seven (21.9%) patients were on hemodialysis. The most common concomitant medications were antihypertensives (59.4%) and corticosteroids (31.2%); two (6.3%) patients were being treated with rituximab; 27 (84.4%) patients had viral persistence following pretreatment remdesivir failure. Following ensitrelvir treatment, all patients experienced clinical improvement as assessed by the investigator. No ICU admissions or deaths due to COVID 19 occurred. Viral clearance was recorded in 18 (56.3%) patients by day 5 and 25 (78.1%) patients at final measurement. No new safety signals were observed. Discussion: This case series represents ensitrelvir clinical efficacy in hospitalized patients with SARS CoV 2 in a real world setting. Most patients experienced persistent viral shedding despite pretreatment with antivirals, and most were considered high risk due to underlying conditions. Despite this, no patients experienced progression of COVID 19 to severe or critical disease, including those who failed prior remdesivir treatment. The antiviral activity of ensitrelvir demonstrated here indicates it is a viable treatment option for SARS CoV 2 infection in this setting. Conclusion: Ensitrelvir was associated with potent antiviral activity and positive clinical outcomes in high risk, hospitalized patients with various and population surveillance of new SARS-CoV-2 variants in a regional public health laboratory (preprint)](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/ppzbmed-10.1101.2023.09.01.23293209) ABSTRACT Background: Timely genomic surveillance is required to inform public health responses to new SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, the processes involved in local genomic surveillance introduce inherent time constraints. The Regional Innovative Public Health Laboratory in Chicago developed and employed a genomic surveillance response playbook for the early detection and surveillance of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Methods: The playbook outlines modifications to sampling strategies, laboratory workflows, and communication processes based on the emerging variant's predicted viral characteristics, observed public health impact in other jurisdictions and local community risk level. The playbook outlines procedures for implementing and reporting enhanced and accelerated genomic surveillance, including supplementing whole genome sequencing (WGS) with variant screening by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Results: The ability of the playbook to improve the response to an emerging variant was tested for SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1. Increased submission of clinical remnant samples from local hospital laboratories enabled detection of a new variant at 1% prevalence with 95% confidence rather than 2% at baseline. Genotyping qPCR concurred with WGS lineage assignments in 99.9% of 1541 samples with results by both methods, and was more sensitive, providing lineage results in 90.4% of 1833 samples rather than 85.1% for WGS, while reducing the time to lineage result from 27 to 7 days. Conclusions: The genomic surveillance response playbook provides a structured, stepwise, and data-driven approach to responding to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. These pre-defined processes can streamline workflows and expedite the detection and public health response to emerging variants. Based on the processes piloted during the Omicron BA.1 response, this method has been applied to subsequent Omicron subvariants and can be readily applied to future SARS-CoV-2 emerging variants and other public health surveillance activities.

MALDI-MS has been proposed for use on commonly available respiratory samples, without specialized sample preparation, making this technology especially attractive for implementation in low-resource regions. Here, we assessed the utility of MALDI-MS in differentiating SARS-CoV-2 versus non-COVID acute respiratory infections (NCARI) in a clinical lab setting of Kazakhstan. Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from in- and outpatients with respiratory symptoms and from asymptomatic controls (AC) in 2020-2022. PCR was used to differentiate SARS-CoV-2+ and NCARI cases. MALDI-MS spectra were obtained for a total of 252 samples (115 SARS-CoV-2+, 98 NCARI and 39 AC) without specialized sample preparation. In our first sub-analysis, we followed a published protocol for peak preprocessing and Machine Learning (ML), trained on publicly available spectra from South American SARS-CoV-2+ and NCARI samples. In our second sub-analysis, we trained ML models on a peak intensity matrix representative of both South American (SA) and Kazakhstan (Kaz) samples. Results: Applying the established MALDI-MS pipeline \"as is\" resulted in a high detection rate for SARS-CoV-2+ samples (91.0%), but low accuracy for NCARI (48.0%) and AC (67.0%) by the top-performing random forest model. After re-training of the ML algorithms on the SA-Kaz peak intensity matrix, the accuracy of detection by the top-performing Support Vector Machine with radial basis function kernel model was at 88.0, 95.0 and 78% for the Kazakhstan SARS-CoV-2+, NCARI, and AC subjects, respectively with a SARS-CoV-2 vs. rest ROC AUC of 0.983 [0.958, 0.987]; a high differentiation accuracy was maintained for the South American SARS-CoV-2 and NCARI. Conclusions: MALDI-MS/ML is a feasible approach for the differentiation of ARI without a specialized sample preparation. The implementation of MALDI-MS/ML in a real clinical lab setting will necessitate continuous optimization to keep up with the rapidly evolving landscape of ARI.

Subject(s) [COVID-19](https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/?lang=en&q=mh:\"COVID-19\") ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in December 2019, prompted governments to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to curb its spread. Despite these efforts and the discovery of vaccines and treatments, the disease continued to circulate globally, evolving into multiple waves, largely driven by emerging COVID-19 variants. Mathematical models have been very useful in understanding the dynamics of the pandemic. Mainly, their focus has been limited to individual waves without easy adaptability to multiple waves. In this study, we propose a compartmental model that can accommodate multiple waves, built on three fundamental concepts. Firstly, we consider the collective impact of all factors affecting COVID-19 and express their influence on the transmission rate through piecewise exponential-cum-constant functions of time. Secondly, we introduce techniques to model the fore sections of observed waves, that change infection curves with negative gradients to those with positive gradients, hence, generating new waves. Lastly, we implement a jump mechanism in the susceptible fraction, enabling further adjustments to align the model with observed infection curve. By applying this model to the Kenyan context, we successfully replicate all COVID-19 waves from March 2020 to January 2023. The identified change points align closely with the emergence of dominant COVID-19 variants, affirming their pivotal role in driving the waves. Furthermore, this adaptable approach can be extended to investigate any new COVID-19 variant or any other periodic infectious diseases, including influenza.

Based on our pre-clinical data suggesting downstream pulmonary dysfunction with COVID-19 induced type 2 inflammation, we contacted patients from our Phase IIa study at 1 year for assessment of Post Covid-19 Conditions (PCC). Methods: Subjects at 1 year after treatment underwent pulmonary function testing (PFTs), high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) imaging, symptom questionnaires, neurocognitive assessments, and serum immune biomarker analysis, with subject survival also monitored. The primary outcome was the proportion of abnormal PFTs, defined as an abnormal diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) or 6-minute walk testing (6MWT) at the 1-year visit. Results: Sixteen of the 29 one-year survivors consented to the follow up visit. We found that subjects who had originally received dupilumab were less likely to have abnormal PFTs compared to those who received placebo (Fishers exact p=0.011, adjusted p=0.058). We additionally found that 3 out of 19 subjects (16%) in the dupilumab group died by 1 year compared to 8 out of 21 subjects (38%) in the placebo group (log rank p=0.12). We did not find significant differences in neurocognitive testing, symptoms or CT chest imaging between treatment groups but observed evidence of reduced type 2 inflammation in those who received dupilumab. Conclusions: We observed evidence of reduced long-term morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 with dupilumab treatment during acute hospitalization when added to standard "}
