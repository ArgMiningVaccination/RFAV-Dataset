For these same HCP who do not have evidence of immunity, healthcare facilities should recommend 2 doses of MMR vaccine during an outbreak of measles or mumps and 1 dose during an outbreak of rubella. Varicella It is recommended that all HCP be immune to varicella. Evidence of immunity in HCP includes documentation of 2 doses of varicella vaccine given at least 28 days apart, history of varicella or herpes zoster based on physician diagnosis, laboratory evidence of immunity, or laboratory conrmation of disease. Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis (Td/Tdap) All adults who have completed a primary series of a tetanus/diphtheria-containing product (DTP, DTaP, DT, Td) should receive Td boosters every 10 years. As soon as feasible, HCP younger than age 65 years with direct patient contact should be given a 1-time dose of Tdap, with priority given to those having contact with infants younger than age 12 months. Meningococcal Vaccination is recommended for microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of N. meningitidis. Use of MCV4 is preferred for persons younger than age 56 years; give IM. Use MPSV4 only if there is a permanent contraindica-tion or precaution to MCV4. Use of MPSV4 (not MCV4) is recommended for HCP older than age 55; give SC. References1.

Test for hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) to document immunity 1-2 months after dose #3. s If anti-HBs is at least 10 mIU/mL (positive), the patient is immune. No further serologic testing or vaccination is recommended. s If anti-HBs is less than 10 mIU/mL (negative), the patient is unpro- tected from hepatitis B series. after dose #3. - If anti-HBs is positive, the patient is immune. No further testing or vac- cination is recommended. - If anti-HBs is negative after 6 doses of vaccine, patient is a non-responder. For non-responders: HCP who are non-responders should be considered susceptible to HBV and should be counseled regarding precautions to prevent HBV infection and the need to obtain HBIG prophylaxis for any known or probable parenteral exposure to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive blood. 1 It is also possible that non-responders are persons who are HBsAg positive. Testing should be considered. HCP found to be HBsAg positive should be counseled and medically evaluated.Note: Anti-HBs testing is not recommended routinely for previously vac- cinated HCP who were not tested 1-2 months after their original vaccine series. These HCP should be tested for anti-HBs when they have an exposure to blood or body fluids. If found to be anti-HBs negative, the HCP should be treated as if susceptible. 1 Influenza All HCP, including physicians, nurses, paramedics, emergency medical tech-nicians, employees of nursing homes and chronic care facilities, students in these professions, and volunteers, should receive annual vaccination against influenza. Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) may only be given to non-pregnant healthy HCP age 49 years and younger. Inactivated injectable influenza vaccine (TIV) is preferred over LAIV for HCP who are in close contact with severely immunosuppressed persons (e.g., stem cell transplant patients) when patients require protective isolation. Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) HCP who work in medical be immune to measles, mumps, and rubella. s\u0000HCP born in 1957 or later can be considered immune to measles, mumps, or rubella only if they have documentation of (a) laboratory conrmation Healthcare Personnel Vaccination Recommendations Hepatitis B Give 3-dose series (dose #1 now, #2 in 1 month, #3 approximately 5 months after #2). Give IM. Obtain anti-HBs serologic testing 1-2 months after dose #3. Influenza Give 1 dose of influenza vaccine annually. Give inactivated injectable influenza vaccine intramuscularly or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) intranasally. MMR For healthcare personnel (HCP) born in 1957 or later without serologic evidence of immunity or prior vaccination, give 2 doses of MMR, 4 weeks apart. For HCP born prior to 1957, see below. Give SC. Varicella For HCP who have no serologic proof of immunity, prior vaccination, or history of varicella disease, (chickenpox) give 2 doses of varicella vaccine, 4 weeks apart. Give SC. Tetanus, diphtheria, Give all HCP a Td booster dose every 10 years, following the completion of the primary 3-dose series. pertussis Give a 1-time dose of Tdap to all HCP younger than age 65 years with direct patient contact. Give IM. Meningococcal Give 1 dose to microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of N. meningitidis. Vaccine Recommendations in brief Hepatitis A, typhoid, and polio vaccines are not routinely recommended for HCP who may have on-the-job exposure to fecal material. \u00dc\u00dc\u00dc\u00b0\u0088\u0093\u0093\u00d5\u0098\u0088\u00e2i\u00b0\u009c\u00c0}\u00c9V>\u00cc}\u00b0`\u00c9\u00ab\u00d3\u00e4\u00a3\u00c7\u00b0\u00ab`v\u00ca\u00caU\u00ca\u00ca\u0016\u00cci\u0093\u00ca\u009b*\u00d3\u00e4\u00a3\u00c7\u00ca\u00ad\u00a3\u00e4\u00c9\u00e4\u0099\u00aeAdapted from the Michigan Department 234 Saint Paul, MN 55104 Nonprofit Org. U.S. Postage PAID MN V01-1Deborah L. Wexler, MDExecutive DirectorDear Colleagues, If you're like most people who work in medicine, your patients' well-being is of primary concern to you. Yet every year more than 200,000 MDs and RNs needlessly expose their patients to the influenza virus. Are you one of them? According to CDC, only 34% of MDs and RNs get vaccinated annually against influenza. This means that over 2.3 million MDs and RNs are unvaccinated and at risk not only for contracting influenza but also for passing it on to others. On average, 20,000 people die annually in the U.S. from influenza or its complications. Some of these cases are unwittingly passed from healthprofessionals to their patients. Why are so many of us unvaccinated? According to surveys, here are some reasons: 1. I don't get sick and I never get influenza. About 10-25% of people get influenza each year, and health professionals are not exempt. Many of us develop only mild symptoms of the disease, so we often don't get a florid influenza syndrome. But even with minimal symptoms, we can still transmit the full-blown illness to ourpatients. Health professionals are notorious for going to work even when sick. With mild illness\u2014scratchy throats, muscle aches\u2014we talk with patients, check blood pressures, examine throats. We breathe the air. We infect others with respiratory viruses. 2. I'm not in a risk group. If you are a healthy person under the age of 50, you might not be in an influenza risk group, but as a health professional, you put other people at risk. Unvaccinated health care workersput hundreds of others at risk for influenza. Our patients can get infected, need to be hospital- ized, and even die from influenza. The only acceptable reason for your not being vaccinated is a valid medical contraindication. By not getting vaccinated against influenza, you endanger thelives of others. 3. I forget to get vaccinated or don't have time. No time? Plan ahead to make the time next fall. Make influenza vaccination a priority for all the employees in your practice or hospital. Establish a system so that everyone is vaccinated against influenza free of charge every year and no one forgets. 4. I'm concerned about vaccine side effects. The most common side effect from influenza vaccine is arm soreness. Two recent studies demonstrated that influenza vaccine caused no significant difference in systemic side effects (fever, headache, fatigue, myalgias) when compared to placebo injection. (Margolis, KL et al.,JAMA. 1990; 264: 1339-1141. Nichol, KL et al., Arch Intern Med. 1996;156:1546-1550.) All clinics, hospitals, and long-term care facilities should require that their employees receiveinfluenza vaccine and provide it free of charge. While the investment may seem high, in thelong run, it often offers a cost savings to society and it saves lives. If your facility doesn't have a system in place to vaccinate all staff members, now is the time to start planning. Make sure you get vaccinated every year and that all staff members in your facility do too. Make it a requirement. Once a year. It's so simple. And it's lifesaving. After all, isn't this what medicine is all about? Health professionals can spread disease. Make sure you're vaccinated! Thank you, readers! We receive tremendous support from you. Thank you to CDC! CDC provides invaluable technical support as well as two federal grants. Thank you for your educational grants to all the following: \u0081 American Pharmaceutical Association \u0081 Nabi \u0081 Wyeth Lederle Vaccines IAC receives funding from a variety of sources, both public and private, andmaintains strict editorial independence. Doc, I know it's important for me to get a flu shot each year, but do you get one too? Y es, I do! it's the policy in our practice that everyone gets a flu shot unless they have a valid medical contraindication. 3First do no harm Protect patients by making sure all staff receive yearly influenza vaccine! Big changes have taken place in influenza vaccina- tion of healthcare personnel (HCP): The respon-sibility for increasing the rates of HCP influenza vaccination is rapidly shifting from the employee to the employer. What's happened? At CDC: In February 2006, CDC published \"In-fluenza Vaccination of Health-Care Personnel.\" These recommendations \"apply to HCP in acute care hospitals, nursing homes, skilled nursing fa-cilities, physician ofces, urgent care centers, and outpatient clinics, and to persons who provide home healthcare and emergency medical ser-vices.\" They were issued jointly by HICPAC (the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee) and ACIP (the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices). The summary box in the right column presents an overview, includ-ing the recommendation that employers vaccinate employees at the work site at no cost. To obtain a copy of the complete recommendations, go to: www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5502.pdf. At The Joint Commission: In January 2007, a new infection control standard of The Joint Com-mission went into effect. It requires accredited organizations to offer influenza vaccinations to staff, volunteers, and licensed independent practi-tioners who have close patient contact. The stan-dard is an accreditation requirement for the Criti-cal Access Hospital, Hospital, and Long Term Care accreditation programs. Why is it happening? The short answer is because HCP influenza vac-cination rates remain appallingly low, and unvac-cinated HCP are infecting vulnerable patients with influenza. Only half of HCP were vaccinated against influenza in the 2008-09 season, even though ACIP has urged annual influenza vaccina-tion for HCP since 1981. Further, influenza trans-mission has been documented among patients in a variety of clinical settings, and infections have been linked to unvaccinated HCP. Clearly, we are doing our patients harm. What should your healthcare facility do to comply? In the box below are practical online resources healthcare organizations will nd valuable in creat-ing influenza vaccination programs for employees.

The recommendations are as follows: Educate HCP regarding the benets of influenza vaccination and the potential health consequences of influenza illness for themselves and their patients, the epi-demiology and modes of transmission, diagnosis, treatment, and nonvaccine in-fection control strategies, in accordance with their level of responsibility in pre- venting health-care-associated influenza. Offer influenza vaccine annually to all eligible HCP to protect staff, patients, and family members and to decrease HCP absenteeism. Use of either available vaccine (i.e., inactivated [TIV] or live at-tenuated influenza vaccine [LAIV]) is recommended for eligible persons. Provide influenza vaccination to HCP at the work site and at no cost as one component of employee health pro-grams. Use strategies that have been demonstrated to increase influenza vac-cine acceptance, including vaccination clinics, mobile carts, vaccination access during all work shifts, and modeling and support by institutional leaders. Obtain a signed declination from HCP who decline vaccination for reasons other than medical contraindications. Monitor HCP vaccination coverage and declination at regular intervals during influenza season and provide feedback of ward-, unit-, and specialty-specic rates to staff and administration. Use the level of HCP influenza vacci-nation coverage as one measure of a patient-safety quality program. Practical resources for vaccinating HCP against influenzaHealthcare employers are not only strongly encouraged to increase their employees' influenza immu-nization rates, in some instances, their organization's accreditation depends on it! In 2006, the Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published vaccination influenza recommendations for healthcare settings, and in 2007, The Joint Commission established influenza infection control standards. www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2014.pdf Item #P2014 (6/10) Immunization Action Coalition (651) 647-9009 www.immunize.org www.vaccin einformation.orgTechnical content reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, June 2010.Visit IAC's \"Honor Roll for Patient Safety\" to view stellar examples of influenza vaccination mandates in healthcare settings at www.immunize.org/honor-roll 4Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report Recommendations and Reports December 1, 2006 / Vol. 55 / No. RR-15 INSIDE: Continuing Education Examination depar depardepar depardepar tment of health and human sertment of health and human sertment of health and human sertment of health and human sertment of health and human ser vices vicesvices vicesvices Centers for Disease Control and PreventionCenters for Disease Control and PreventionCenters for Disease Control and PreventionCenters for Disease Control and PreventionCenters for Disease Control and PreventionGeneral Recommendations on Immunization Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 5MMWR Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Julie L.

It was prepared in consultation with the HospitalInfection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) and is consistent with current HICPAC guidelines for infection controlin health-care personnel. These recommendations can assist hospital administrators, infection control practitioners, employee healthphysicians, and HCWs in optimizing infection prevention and control programs. Background information for each vaccine-preventable disease and specific recommendations for use of each vaccine are presented. The diseases are grouped into threecategories: a) those for which active immunization is strongly recommended because of special risks for HCWs; b) those for whichimmunoprophylaxis is or may be indicated in certain circumstances; and c) those for which protection of all adults is recommended.This report reflects current ACIP recommendations at the time of publication. ACIP statements on individual vaccines and diseaseupdates in MMWR should be consulted for more details regarding the epidemiology of the diseases, immunization schedules,vaccine doses, and the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. INTRODUCTIONBecause of their contact with patients or infective material from patients, many health-care workers (HCWs)(e.g., physicians, nurses, emergency medical personnel, dental professionals and students, medical and nursing students, laboratory technicians,hospital volunteers, and administrative staff) are at risk for exposure to and possible transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases.Maintenance of immunity is therefore an essential part of prevention and infection control programs for HCWs. Optimal use ofimmunizing agents safeguards the health of workers and protects patients from becoming infected through exposure to infectedworkers ( Table_1 ) (1-15). Consistent immunization programs could substantially reduce both the number of susceptible HCWs in hospitals and health departments and the attendant risks for transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases to other workers andpatients (16). In addition to HCWs in hospitals and health departments, these recommendations apply to those in private physicians'offices, nursing homes, schools, and laboratories, and to first responders. Any medical facility or health department that provides direct patient care is encouraged to formulate a comprehensive immunization policy for all HCWs. The American Hospital Association has endorsed the concept of immunization programs forboth hospital personnel and patients (17). The following recommendations concerning vaccines of importance to HCWs should beconsidered during policy development ( Table_2 ). BACKGROUND Diseases for Which Immunization Is Strongly RecommendedOn the basis of documented nosocomial transmission, HCWs are considered to be at significant risk for acquiring or transmitting hepatitis B, influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. All of these diseases are vaccine-preventable. Hepatitis BHepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the major infectious hazard for health-care personnel. During 1993, an estimated 1,450 workers became infected through exposure to blood and serum-derived body fluids, a 90% decrease from the number estimated to have been 8The complete article can be accessed online at: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050577.htm .

The 2010 influenza recommendations include new and updated information. Highlights of the 2010 recommendations include 1) a recommendation that annual vaccination be administered to all persons aged 6 months for the 2010-11 influenza season; 2) a recommendation that children aged 6 months-8 years whose vaccination status is unknown or who have never received seasonal influenza vaccine before (or who received seasonal vaccine for the rst time in 2009-10 but received only 1 dose in their rst year of vaccination) as well as children who did not receive at least 1 dose of an influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine regardless of previous influenza vaccine history should receive 2 doses of a 2010-11 seasonal influenza vaccine (minimum interval: 4 weeks) during the 2010-11 season; 3) a recommendation that vaccines containing the 2010-11 trivalent vaccine virus strains A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like (the same strain as was used for 2009 monovalent vaccines), A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like, information about Fluzone High-Dose, a newly approved vaccine for persons aged 65 years; and 5) information about other standard-dose newly approved influenza vaccines and previously approved vaccines with expanded age indications. Vaccination eorts should begin as soon as the 2010-11 seasonal influenza vaccine is available and continue through the influenza season. These recommendations also include a summary of safety data for U.S.-licensed influenza vaccines. These recommendations and other information are available at CDC's influenza website (http://www.cdc.gov/flu); any updates or supplements that might be required during the 2010-11 influenza season also will be available at this website. Recommendations for influenza diagnosis and antiviral use will be published before the start of the 2010-11 influenza season. Vaccination and health-care providers should be alert to announce - ments of recommendation updates and should check the CDC influenza website periodically for additional information. Introduction In the United States, annual epidemics of influenza occur typically during the late fall through early spring. Influenza viruses can cause disease among persons in any age group, but rates of infection are highest among children ( 1-3). During these annual epidemics, rates of serious illness and death are highest among persons aged 65 years, children aged <2 years, and persons of any age who have medical conditions that 11The complete article can be accessed online at: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr59e0729a1.htm . 12The Immunization Action Coalition thanks Eric E.

For information about additional vaccines you may need, see the references at the bottom of page 3. CDC answers frequently asked questions about how to protect healthcare workers (page 1 of 3)Hepatitis B and the healthcare worker www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2109.pdf Item #P2109 (6/08)Which workers in the healthcare setting need hepatitis B vaccine? The Occupational Safety a nd H ealth Administra- tion (OSHA) requires that hepatitis B vaccine be offered t o h ealthcare w ork ers (HCWs) who hav e a reasonable expectation of being exposed t o blood on the j ob. This requirement does not include HCWs who w ould not be expected t o hav e oc- cupational risk, s uch as receptionists, billing staff, and general ofce w ork ers. At what anatomic site should hepatitis B vaccine be administered to adults? What needle size should be used? The deltoid muscle i s recommended f or routine intramus cular (IM) vaccin ation among ad ults. The gluteus muscle should not be u sed a s a site f or administering hepatitis B vaccine. The suggested needle size i s 1\"-2\" depending on the recipi- ent' s g ender a nd w eight (1\" for f emales w eigh- ing less than eighing 70-100 w eighing than 120 kg; and 2\" for males w eighing 120 kg or m ore and f emales m ore than 100 kg). A 22- to 25-gauge needle sho uld be u sed. F or optimal protection, it is c rucial that the vaccine be a dministered IM, not subcutaneously . If a HCW had one dose only of hepatitis B vaccine 4 months ago, should the series be restarted? No. The h epatitis B vaccine series should not be restarted when doses a re delayed; rather , the series should be c ontinued f rom where it stopped. The HCW should receiv e the second dose of vaccine now and the third dose at le ast 8 week s later . There needs t o be at least 16 wee ks between the rst and the third doses a nd at least 8 weeks between the second and third doses of vaccine. Is it safe for HCWs to be vaccinated during pregnancy? Yes. Limited data indicate no a pparent risk for a d- verse events t o developing fetuses. Current hepa- titis B vaccines c ontain noninfectious h epatitis B surfac e a ntigen (HBsAg) and should pose no risk to th e fetus. If th e m other i s being vaccinated be-cause she i s at risk for h epatitis B virus (HBV) infection ( e.g., a HCW, a person with a se xually transmitted disease, an i njection drug user , mul- tiple sex partners), vaccination should be i nitiated a s soon a s h er risk factor i s identied during the pregnanc y. If not vaccinated, a pre gnant w oman may cont ract an HBV in fection, which might result in severe disease f or the m other a nd chronic infec- tion f or the newborn. In a ddition, giving hepatitis B vaccine t o the m other i s not a contraindication to breastfeeding. Which HCWs need serologic testing after receiving 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine? All HCWs who hav e a reasonable risk of expo- sure t o blood or body fluids c ontain ing blood ( e.g., HCWs with d irect patient contact, HCWs who hav e the risk of needlestick or sharps i njury , laborato - ry w ork ers who draw or t est blood) should hav e postvaccination t esting for a ntibody t o h surfac e a ntigen (anti-HBs). Postvaccination t est- ing should be done 1-2 m onths aft er th e la st dose of vaccine. What should be done if a HCW's postvaccina-tion anti-HBs test is negative 1-2 months after the last dose of vaccine? Repeat the 3-dose series a nd t est for a nti-HBs 1-2 months aft er th e la st dose of vaccine. If the HCW is still negativ e after a second vaccine series, the HCW is c onsidered a non-responder t o h epatitis B vaccination. HCWs who do not respond t o vac- cination should be t ested f or HBsAg to determine if they hav e chronic HBV infection. If th e HBsAg test is positiv e, the person should rec eive appropri- ate c ounseling and m edical management. Persons who test negativ e for HBs Ag should be c onsi dered susceptible t o HBV infection a nd should be c oun- seled a bout precautions t o prevent HBV infection and the need t o obtain hepatitis B immune glob ulin (HBIG) proph ylaxis f or a ny known or lik ely expo- sure to HBsAg-positiv e blood. How often should I test HCWs after they've received the hepatitis B vaccine series to make sure they're protected? For immune c ompetent HCWs, periodic testing or periodic boosting is not needed. Postvaccination testing (an ti-HBs ) should be done 1-2 months after the last dose of hepatitis B vaccine. If adequate anti-HBs (at least 10 mIU/mL) is present, nothing more needs t o be done. If postvaccination t esting is less than 10 mIU/mL, the vaccine series should be repeated a nd a nti-HBs testing done, 1-2 months after the last dose of the second series. This i nfor- mation should be rec orded i n the HCW' s employee health record. Should a HCW who performs invasive proce-dures and who once had a positive anti-HBs result be revaccinated if the anti-HBs titer is rechecked and is less than 10 mIU/mL? No. Immune c ompetent persons k nown t o hav e re- sponded t o h epatitis B vaccination do not require additional passiv e or activ e immun ization. Postvac- cination t esting should be done 1-2 months after the original vaccine series i s c ompleted. In this scena rio, the initial postvaccin ation t esting showed that the HCW was protected. Substantial evidence suggests that adults who respond t o h epatitis B vaccination (anti-HBs of at least 10 mIU/mL) are protected f rom chronic HBV infection f or a s long as 23 years, even if there i s no detectable a nti-HBs currently . Only immunoc ompromised persons ( e.g., hemodialysi s patient s, som e HIV-positi ve persons) need t o hav e a nti-HBs t esting and boos ter doses of vaccine t o maintain their protectiv e a nti-HBs concentrations of at least 10 mIU/mL. Before reading the recommendations of CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Prac-tices (ACIP) that say not to do this, we tested our employees for anti-HBs several years after they were vaccinated and some people had inadequate results, even though they had all completed a 3-dose series. What should we do now? ACIP does concentrations de- cline over time, and HCWs remain protected even if their a nti-HBs c oncentration declines t o below Immunization Action Coalition 1573 Selby e been vaccin ated in the past and who do not hav e a documented re- sponse t o vaccin ation of at le ast 10 mIU/mL, ACIP recommends t esting for a nti-HBs at the time of an exposure a nd providing appropriate management based on the results of testing. (See poste xposure gui deli nes i n Table 1.) If cost i s not a great conc ern or if an employee or employer wa nt s documented assurance of immunity , a re vaccination series can be u ndertak en f ollowed by t esting 1-2 months after the 3rd dose of hepatitis B vaccine. How often should anti-HBs testing be done on HCWs who perform invasive procedures? For persons whose immune status i s normal, pe- riodic serologic testing to a ssess a nti-HBs c on- centrations i s not necessary . Persons who perform invasive proc edu res should be t reated no differently from other HCWs with respect to anti-HBs testing. If a HCW has a n exposure ( e.g., needlestick), s/he should be evaluated f or their need f or immu no- proph ylaxis according to poste xposure guidelines in Ta ble 1. If HCWs received hepatitis B vaccination in the past and were not tested for immunity, should they be tested now? No. In this scenario, a HCW does not need t o be tested u nless s/he ha s an exposure. If an exposure occurs, refer t o the poste xposure guidelines i n Table 1. How should a vaccinated HCW with an unknown anti-HBs response be managed if they have a percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood or body fluids from an HBsAg-positive source? This person should be t ested f or a nti-HBs a s soon as possible after exposure. If the a nti-HBs c oncen - tration i s at least 10 mIU/mL, no further t reatment is needed. If the anti-HBs conc ent ration i s less than 10 mIU/mL, HBIG and one dose of hepatitis B vac- cine should be a dministered. Pr ior t o admi nistering the HBIG and vaccine, blood should be draw n for a baseli ne HB sAg t est. Subsequentl y, dditional anti-HBs a nd a n HB sAg test should be performed. If the HBsAg is positiv e, the person is infected a nd should be re ferred f or m edical evalu- ation. If the a nti-HBs result is at least 10 mIU/mL, the person i s seroprotected. It is necessary t o do postvaccination t esting later tha n the u sual recom- mended time f rame because a HBIG might be det ected if testin g is done a ny earlier. The postvaccin ation t est result should be rec orded i n the person' s health record. For a pre-employment physical, a HCW states she received all three hepatitis B vaccine doses as an adolescent. Would you test for anti-HBs? If the HCW has w ritten documentation of a full hepatitis B vaccine series, testing for a nti-HBs at this point is not necessary . If the HCW has a subsequent exposure t o HBV , hepatitis B immu- noproph ylaxis should be a dministered f ollowing guidelines f or a person who has been vaccinated, but the immune response i s not kno wn (Table 1). This i nformation should be documented i n the HCW' s employee h ealth record. This a pproach should be sufcient to m eet the needs of the em- ployer a nd the requirem ent s of OSHA. If there is no written documentation of hepatitis B vacci nation, see the ne xt question.

PHS Guidelines for the Management of Occupational Exposures to HBV , HCV , and HIV and MMWR, 6/29/01, Vol. 50 (RR-11)(page 2 of 3) 14If the HBsAg test is positiv e, the person should receiv e a ppropriate c ounseling and m edical man - agement. Persons who t est negativ e f or HBsAg should be c onsi dered susceptib le to HBV in fection and should be c ounseled a bout precautions t o pre- vent HBV infection a nd the need t o obtain HBIG proph ylaxis f or a ny known or lik ely exposure t o HBsAg-positiv e blood (see Ta ble 1). Can a person with chronic HBV infection become a HCW? Yes. All HCWs should practice standard precau- tions, which are designed t o prevent HBV tr ansmis - sion, both from patient s to HCW and f rom HCW to patient. There i s, ho wever, one cav eat concerning HBV-in fected HCWs . are HBs Ag a nd HBeAg (hepatitis B e antigen) positiv e should not perform exposure-prone procedures (e.g., gynecologic, cardiothoracic surgery) unless they hav e sought counsel from an expert review panel and been a dvised u nder what cir cums tances, if any , they may c ontinue t o perform these proce- dures. Such cir cums tances might in clude notify ing prospectiv e patients of the HCW' s seropositivity before they undergo exposure-prone i nvasive pro- cedu res. F or m ore i nformation on this issu e, see the Mortality and Morbidity Weekly Report, \"Recom- mendations for Preventing T ransmissi on of Huma n Immu nodecienc y Vi rus a nd H epatitis B Virus t o Patients P roce- oncentrations that decline t o less than 10 mIU/mL are still protected against HBV infection. F or HCWs with normal immune status who hav e dem onst rated a dequate anti-HBs (at le ast 10 mIU/mL) f o llowing vaccination, booster doses of vaccine or periodic anti-HBs t esting is not rec- ommended. A person who is a known non-responder to hepatitis B vaccine has a percutaneous expo-sure to HBsAg-positive blood. According to older ACIP recommendations, I have the option to give HBIG x 2 or HBIG x 1 and initiate revaccination. How do I decide which to do? Current recommendations hav e been revised. The recommended poste xposure proph ylaxis f or per- sons who non-responders t o h epatitis B vac- cine (i.e., hav e not responded t o a n initial 3-dose series a nd revaccination with a 3-dose series) is to giv e HBIG as soon a s possible after exposure and a second dose of HBIG one m onth later ( see Table 1). Exposed persons, who a re k nown not to hav e responded t o a primary vaccine series, but hav e not been revaccinated with a second 3-dose series, should receiv e a single dose of HBIG and reinitiate the h epatitis B vaccine series with the rst dose of h epatitis B vaccine a s soon a s possi ble after e xposure. If an employee does not respond to hepatitis B vaccination (employee has had two full series of hepatitis B vaccine), does s/he need to be removed from activities that expose her/him to bloodborne pathogens? Does the employer have a responsibility in this area beyond providing the vaccine? There a re no regulations that require rem oval from job situations where exposu re t o bloodborne patho- gens c ould dual polic y deci- sion within the organization. OSHA regulations require that employees i n j obs where there i s a reasonable risk of exposure t o blood be offered hepatitis B vaccine. In a ddition, the regulati on states that adequate personal protectiv e equip- ment be provided a nd that standard precautions be f ollowed. Check your state O SHA regulations regarding additional requirements. If there a re no state O SHA regulations, federal OSHA regula- tions should be f ollowed. Adequate documentation should be placed i n the employee record regarding non-response to vaccination. HCWs who do not respond t o vaccin ation should be t ested f or HBs Ag to determine if they hav e chronic HBV infection. Keep your own vaccination history! Record the dates you received hepatitis B vaccine, as well as the results of your postvaccination serologic testing (anti-HBs). Remember to save records of any vaccinations you receive so you don't have to repeat them. To order adult immunization record cards, visit www.immunize.org/adultizcards.Several physicians in our group have no documentation showing they received hepatitis B vaccine. They are relatively sure, however, that they received the doses many years ago. What do we do now? Because there i s no documentation of vaccina- tion, the 3-dose vaccination series should be a d- ministered a nd postvaccination t esting should be performed 1-2 months after the third dose of vac- cine. There i s no harm in receivi ng extra doses of vaccine. Care should alwa ys be tak en t o document vaccine l ot, date, manufacturer , route, and vaccine dosages. Postvaccin ation t esting results should also be document ed, in cluding the date testin g was per- formed. All organizations ( e.g., h ospitals, clinics) should develop policies or guidelines t o a ssure valid hepatitis B immunization. A healthcare worker (HCW) thinks she had 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine in the past but has no documentation of receiving those doses. Before reading the recommendations to revaccinate her, we obtained an anti-HBs titer and the result was greater than 10 mIU/mL. With this lab result, can't we assume she is immune? A positiv e a nti-HBs i ndicates that the vaccinated person i s immune at the time the HCW was t ested, but does not necessarily a ssure that the HCW has long-term immun ity. Long-term immun ity has been shown only f or persons attaining an a dequate a nti- HBs result of at least 10 mIU/mL after a 3-dose vaccin ation seri es. The most direct wa y to deal with this is to vaccin ate the HCW with the 3-dose seri es of hepatitis B vaccine; test for a nti-HBs i n 1-2 months and document the result in the HCW' s em- ployee h ealth record. An a dequate anti-HBs result from a documented 3-dose vaccine series w ould assure not only seroprotection, but long-term pro- tection, as well. Of c ourse, it is possi ble that the HCW has an anti- HBs result of greater than 10 mIU/mL because of an HBV infection i n the past. If this i s of concern, a total anti-HBc test could be performed t o discern this (a positiv e result indicates a history of HBV infection at some undened period in time). I'm a nurse who received the hepatitis B vaccine series more than 10 years ago and had a positive follow-up titer (at least 10 mIU/mL). At present, my titer is negative (less than 10 mIU/mL). What should I do now? Nothing. Data s how that vaccine-induced a nti-HBs levels might decline over time; ho wever, immune memory (a namnestic anti-HBs response) remains Hepatitis B and the healthcare worker Page 3 For more information on vaccination recommendations for healthcare workers, see the following: 1. \"Immunization of Vaccination Recommendations,\" Immunization Action Coalition, www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2017.pdf (page 3 of 3) 15ACIP Recommendations for Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) 'Evidence of for Healthcare Personnel Date of ACIP vote: June 24, 2009 Date of posting of provisional recommendations: August 28, 2009 On June 24, 2009 the ACIP voted on revised re commendations for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) 'evidence of immunity' requirem ents for healthcare personnel . The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) has endorsed these changes. Summary of new recommendations: Adequate presumptive evidence of immunity to measles, rubella, and mumps for persons who work in health care facilities: Measles : a. Documented administration of two doses of live measles virus vaccine1 or b. Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease or c. Born before 19572 34 Rubella a. Documented administration of one do se of live rubella virus vaccine1 or b. Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease or c. Born before 1957 (except women of childbearing age who could become pregnant)234 Mumps a. Documented administration of two doses of live mumps virus vaccine1 or b. Laboratory evidence of immunity or laboratory confirmation of disease or c. Born before 1957234 1 The first dose should be administered on or afte r the first birthday; the second dose of measles and mumps-containing vaccine should be administ ered no earlier than one month (i.e., a minimum of 28 days) after the first dose. Combined MMR va ccine generally should be used whenever any of its component vaccines is indicated. 2 May vary depending on current state or local requirements. 3 For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or laborato ry confirmation of disease, health care facilities should consider vaccinating personnel with two doses of MMR vacc ine at the appropriate interval (for measles and mumps) and one dose of MMR vaccine (for rubella), respectively. 4 For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles, mumps and/or rubella immunity or labo ratory confirmation of disease, healthcare facilities should recommend two doses of MMR vaccine during an outbreak of measles or mumps and one dose during an outbreak of rubella. These recommendations update two previous ACIP documents: 1.

The index case occurred in a boy aged 11 years who had returned on June 17 from a trip to the United Kingdom, where approximately 7,400 reports of laboratory-conrmed mumps were received by the Health Protection Agency in 2009.* He then attended a New York summer camp for tradition-observant Jewish boys, where he became symptomatic on June 28. Subsequently, other camp attendees and a sta member were reported to have mumps, and transmission continued in multiple locations when the camp attendees returned home. As of January 29, 2010, a total of 1,521 cases had been reported, with onset dates from June 28, 2009, through January 29, 2010, a substantial increase from the 179 cases reported as of October 30, 2009 ( 1). The outbreak has remained conned primarily to the tradition-observant Jewish community, with <3% of cases occurring among persons outside the community. The largest percentage of cases (61%) has occurred among persons aged 7-18 years, and 76% of the patients are male. Among the patients for whom vaccination status was reported, 88% had received at least 1 dose of mumps-containing vaccine, and 75% had received 2 doses. This is the largest mumps outbreak that has occurred in the United States since 2006 ( 2). Although mumps vaccination alone was not sucient to prevent this outbreak, maintaining high measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage remains the most eective way to prevent outbreaks and limit their size when they occur. Mumps cases included in this report were reported by January 29, 2010. Cases were classified according to the 2008 case denition of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists ; only cases of probable and conrmed mumps are included in this report. In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that children receive 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, with the rst dose administered at 12-15 months and the second dose near the time of school entry (at 4-6 years). \u00a7 Methods used to obtain the vaccination status of patients have included parental report, review of vaccination cards, and verication from health-care providers. The 1,521 outbreak-related mumps cases have been reported from several counties in New York and New Jersey; local transmission is continuing (Figure). The majority (675 [44%]) of cases have been reported from New York City (primarily Brooklyn), followed by Orange County, New York (364 [24%]); Update: Mumps Outbreak \u2014 New Y ork and New Jersey, June 2009-January 2010 INSIDE 130 Transmission of Yellow Fever Vaccine Virus Through Breast-Feeding \u2014 Brazil, 2009 133 Progr ess in Immunization Information Systems \u2014 United States, 2008* Available at http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/archives/2010/news0210.htm#mmps. An illness with acute onset of unilateral or bilateral tender, self-limited swelling of the parotid or other salivary glands, lasting at least 2 days, and without other apparent cause. Probable case: a case that meets the clinical case denition without laboratory conrmation and is epidemiologically linked to a clinically compatible case. Conrmed case: a case that 1) meets the clinical case denition or occurs in a patient with a clinically compatible illness and 2) is either laboratory conrmed or is epidemiologically linked to a conrmed case. Available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncphi/disss/nndss/casedef/mumps_2008.htm. \u00a7 ACIP recommends 2 doses of mumps-containing vaccine for all school-aged children (i.e., grades K-12) and for adults at high risk for disease (i.e., persons who work in health-care facilities, international travelers, and students at post-high school educational institutions). Health-care workers born in or after 1957 without laboratory evidence of immunity should receive 2 doses of mumps-containing vaccine, and those born before 1957 without laboratory evidence of immunity should consider receiving 1 dose. During outbreaks, ACIP recommends oering a second dose of vaccine to children aged 1-4 years (8). 17The MMWR series of publications is published by the Oce of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Laboratory Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Atlanta, GA 30333.

T wenty-ve (2%) cases (reported during June 28-September 8) were associated with the summer camp in Sullivan County, New York; however, no additional cases occurred in the county after the camp ended in late August. Of the 1,521 patients, 1,477 (97%) are members of the tradition-observant Jewish community. Of the 44 cases not associated with this religious community, 33 have been reported from New York City; seven from New Jersey; two from Orange County, New York; and two from Rockland County, New York. Many of these outside cases have occurred among persons who have reported regular contact with members of the aected community. Diagnostic laboratory testing for mumps (i.e., detection of mumps immunoglobulin M antibod-ies by various methods, detection of mumps RNA by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, or isolation of mumps virus in cell culture) has been performed for 761 (50%) cases. Of these, 385 (51%) cases are laboratory conrmed. Of the 1,518 patients whose age is known, 1,385 (91%) are aged >6 years (Figure). The median age of patients is 15 years (range 3 months-90 years) and is similar in all areas with ongoing transmission except New Jersey, where the median age is 17 years. Of the 1,489 patients whose sex is known, 1,136 (76%) are male. Sixty-ve reports of complications from mumps have been received: orchitis (55 cases), pancreatitis (ve cases), aseptic meningitis (two cases), transient deafness (one case), Bell's palsy (one case), and oophoritis (one case). Nineteen hospitalizations from mumps have been reported; no deaths have occurred. Vaccination status is known for 1,115 patients: 966 (91%) of 1,062 patients aged 18 years and 149 (33%) of 456 patients aged 19 years (Table). Of these patients, 976 (88%) had received at least 1 dose of mumps-containing vaccine before the outbreak, and 839 (75%) had received 2 doses. Among patients aged 7-18 years, the age group with the majority of cases and for whom 2 doses of MMR vaccine is recom-mended, 93% had received at least 1 dose, and 85% had received 2 doses. The vaccination status of the 18MMWR Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report MMWR / February 12, 2010 / Vol. 59 / No. 5 127 patients varies by location. The percentage of patients aged >6 years (for whom vaccination status is known) who had received 2 doses of mumps vaccine is highest in Orange County, New York (86%), followed by New York City (83%), New Jersey (76%), and Rockland County, New York (73%). Public health response measures in all aected areas have continued throughout the outbreak. Health-care providers have been notied about the ongoing outbreak, the importance of verifying that children have received all recommended vaccinations, and the need to oer vaccinations to adults with unknown vaccination status who do not have a his-tory of mumps. State and local health departments also have worked with aected schools to enhance vaccination policies, including policies to exclude unvaccinated children from school during outbreaks and to isolate children at home for 5 days after onset of parotitis. Certain jurisdictions have encouraged providers to oer a second dose of MMR vaccine to children aged 1-4 years; however, this strategy has not been a focus of the public health response because FIGURE.

Editorial Note The mumps outbreak in the New York-New Jersey area has grown substantially, and anecdotal reports from certain aected areas suggest that the rate of new cases is not decreasing; the appearance of a downward trend in recent weeks (Figure) is partly a result of reporting delays. The outbreak is occurring almost exclusively in a specic religious community, and no cases outside this community have resulted in sustained transmission. Like the mumps outbreaks that occurred in 2006 (2), much of the current outbreak is occurring in congregate settings, where prolonged, close contact among persons might be facilitating transmission. Within the aected religious community, cases have occurred predominantly among school-aged boys, who attend separate schools from girls. The higher rate among boys might be a result of the additional hours that boys in this community spend in school compared with girls, including long periods in large study halls, often face-to-face with a study partner. In addition, transmission in the community over- all might be facilitated by relatively large household sizes. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, the mean household size in one of the aected communities was 5.7, compared with a mean U.S. household size of 2.6. The limited transmission to persons outside the community might be a result of the relatively less interpersonal contact between persons inside and outside the community. Although the school settings and large household sizes might be promoting transmission, the high vac-cination coverage in the aected community likely is limiting the size of the outbreak. In addition, high vaccination coverage in surrounding communities is the most plausible reason that the few cases outside of the aected community have not caused other outbreaks. In this outbreak, as in other recent mumps out- breaks among highly vaccinated populations ( 3), most cases have occurred in vaccinated persons. The mumps vaccine has greatly reduced the incidence of mumps in the United States. From 1967, when the mumps vaccine was rst licensed, to the early 2000s, the number of reported cases decreased from 186,000 to <500 annually (2 ). Nonetheless, the eectiveness of the mumps component of the MMR vaccine is lower than that of the measles and rubella components. TABLE.

At least one study found 2 doses to be more eective than 1 dose (6). Public health ocials began oering a third dose of vaccine to students in certain schools in Orange County, New York, because mumps transmission had continued among students, despite their high rate of 2-dose coverage. Although a previous study indicated that a third dose of MMR vaccine for seronegative college students resulted in rapid seroconversion with a low rate of IgM response, which is indicative of an anamnestic immune response ( 7), ACIP has not recommended a third dose, and no data exist on the eectiveness of a third dose in either reducing the risk for mumps or altering the course of an outbreak. Data obtained from use of the third dose of MMR vaccine in Orange County might be used to guide future options for mumps outbreak control in settings with high 2-dose coverage. This outbreak emphasizes that mumps outbreaks can occur in highly vaccinated populations. Although several factors play a role in mumps control in the United States (Box), maintenance of high 2-dose MMR vaccine coverage remains the most eective way to prevent and limit the size of mumps outbreaks. What is already known on this topic? The largest U.S. mumps outbreak since 2006 began at a summer camp in New York in June 2009. By October 30, 2009, the outbreak included 179 confirmed and probable cases, primarily among members of certain highly vac cinated, tradition-observant Jewish communities. What is added by this report? As of January 29, 2010, the outbreak included 1,521 cases, 97% of which had occurred in members of the same tradition-observant religious community. Among patients f or whom vaccination status was reported, 88% had received at least 1 dose of mumps- containing vaccine, and 75% had received 2 doses. What are the implications for public health practice? Although vaccination alone does not prevent all mumps outbreaks, maintaining high measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination coverage remains the most effec tive way to prevent outbreaks and limit their size when they occur.

To reduce pertussis morbidity in adolescents and maintain the standard of care for tetanus and diphtheria protection, the Advisory Committee on ImmunizationPractices (ACIP) recommends that: 1) adolescents aged 11--18 years should receive a single dose of Tdap instead oftetanus and diphtheria toxoids vaccine (Td) for booster immunization against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis if theyhave completed the recommended childhood diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole cell pertussis vaccine (DTP)/diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) vaccination series (five doses of pediatricDTP/DTaP before the seventh birthday; if the fourth dose was administered on or after the fourth birthday, the fifthdose is not needed) and have not received Td or Tdap. The preferred age for Tdap vaccination is 11--12 years; 2)adolescents aged 11--18 years who received Td, but not Tdap, are encouraged to receive a single dose of Tdap toprovide protection against pertussis if they have completed the recommended childhood DTP/DTaP vaccination series.An interval of at least 5 years between Td and Tdap is encouraged to reduce the risk for local and systemic reactionsafter Tdap vaccination. However, an interval less than 5 years between Td and Tdap can be used; and 3) vaccine providers should adolescents aged 11--18 years during the same visit if both vaccines are indicated and available.

Introduction Pertussis, an acute, infectious cough illness, remains endemic in the United States despite routine childhood pertussisvaccination for more than half a century and high coverage levels in children for more than a decade ( 1 --4). A primary reason for the continued circulation of Bordetella pertussis is that immunity to pertussis wanes approximately 5--10 years after completion of childhood pertussis vaccination, leaving adolescents and adults susceptible to pertussis(5--10 ). Among the diseases for which universal childhood vaccination has been recommended, pertussis is the least well-controlled reportable bacterial vaccine-preventable disease in the United States ( 11 ,12). In the United States during 1934--1943, an annual average of 200,752 pertussis cases and 4,034 pertussis-relateddeaths were reported ( 13). After the introduction of childhood pertussis vaccination during the 1940s, the number of reported pertussis cases declined dramatically, reaching an historic low of 1,010 in 1976 ( Figure 1 ) (1). Since the 1980s, the number of reported pertussis cases has been steadily increasing, especially among adolescents and adults(4 ,14,15). Possible reasons for the increase in reported pertussis cases include a true increase in the burden of disease and an increase in the detection and reporting of cases; the relative contribution of each of these factors to the increaseobserved is unclear ( 4 ,14--17). Childhood Pertussis Vaccination Policy in the United States Whole cell pertussis vaccines became available during the 1920s ( 18), but pediatric diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole cell pertussis vaccine (DTP) was not routinely recommended for children until the 1940s and 1950s ( 19,20). In 1991, less reactogenic pediatric acellular pertussis vaccine (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussisvaccine [DTaP]) was first licensed for use in children for the fourth and fifth doses of the 5-dose childhoodvaccination series in the United States ( 21 ,22), and in 1996, pediatric DTaP was licensed for the first three infant doses ( 1). In 1997, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that pediatric DTaP be used routinely instead of pediatric DTP as a 5-dose DTaP schedule at ages 2, 4, 6, 15--18 months and 4--6 years(1 ,23); pediatric DTP has not been available in the United States since 2002 (CDC, unpublished data, 2005). Childhood and Adolescent Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccination Policy in the United States Vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria has markedly reduced the number of cases and deaths from tetanus anddiphtheria in the United States in all age groups ( 24 ). From 1997 through spring 2005, three vaccine formulations against tetanus and diphtheria were recommended for use in the United States: pediatric DTaP routinely for children 23MMWR Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report MMWR / July 9, 2010 / Vol. 59 / No. 26 817 birthing hospitals and local health departments to support postpartum vaccination of mothers and close contacts of newborns.

Salmonella Newport Infections Associated with Consumption of Unpasteurized Milk \u2014 Utah, April-June 2010 On April 29, 2010, the Utah Department of Health (UDOH) was notified of three cases of Salmonella enterica serotype Newport infection. The three patients recently had consumed unpasteurized milk purchased from a store in northern Utah (store A). In Utah, unpasteurized milk can be sold legally at licensed dairies or by licensed dairies at dairy-owned retail stores meeting specic requirements ( 1). A central Utah dairy licensed to sell unpasteurized milk (dairy A) owns and sells unpasteurized milk at store A and a second northern Utah store (store B). By May 3, 2010, three additional patients with S. Newport infec- tions had been reported; all recently had consumed unpasteurized milk purchased from store A. UDOH notied the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) of the suspected association between illness and unpasteurized milk consumption, and UDAF suspended sales of unpasteurized milk at the two stores on May 3, 2010. During April 29-June 3, 2010, a total of 10 S. Newport cases were reported to UDOH; all 10 patients had consumed unpasteurized milk from store A (seven patients) or store B (three patients). The patients ranged in age from 2 to 56 years (median: 21 years); six were female. One patient was Pertussis \u2014 California, January-June 2010 The number of pertussis cases reported to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has increased substantially during 2010. The increase in cases was rst noted in late March among patients admitted to a children's hospital. During January 1- June 30, 2010, a total of 1,337 cases were reported, a 418% increase from the 258 cases reported during the same period in 2009. All cases either met the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists denitions for conrmed or probable pertussis or had an acute cough illness and Bordetella pertussis -specic nucleic acid detected by polymerase chain reaction from nasopharyngeal specimens (1 ). During January-June in California, the incidence of pertussis was 3.4 cases per 100,000 population. County rates ranged from zero to 76.9 cases per 100,000 (median: 2.0 cases). By age group, incidence was highest (38.5 cases per 100,000) among infants aged <1 year; 89% of cases were among infants aged <6 months, who are too young to be fully immu-nized. Incidence among children aged 7-9 years and 10-18 years was 10.1 cases and 9.3 cases per 100,000, respectively. Of 634 case reports with available data, 105 (16.6%) patients were hospitalized, of whom 66 (62.9%) were aged <3 months. Incidence among Hispanic infants (49.8 cases per 100,000) was higher than among other racial/ethnic populations. Five deaths were reported, all in previously healthy Hispanic infants aged <2 months at disease onset; none had received any pertussis-containing vaccines. The incidence of pertussis is cyclical, with peaks occurring every 3-5 years in the United States (2 ). The last peak was in 2005, when approximately 25,000 cases were reported nationally and approximately 3,000 cases in California, including eight deaths in infants aged <3 months. If the rates from the rst half of the year persist throughout 2010, California would have its highest annual rate of pertussis reported since 1963 and the most cases reported since 1958. CDPH is attempting to prevent transmission of pertussis to vulnerable infants ( 3) by disseminating educational materials and clinical guidance, raising community awareness, and oering free tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine to Notes from the Field 24MMWR Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 818 MMWR / July 9, 2010 / Vol. 59 / No. 26MMWR on Facebook and Twitter MMWR reports now can be accessed on social networking websites Facebook and T witter.

Isolates from all 10 patients were identi- ed as indistinguishable by two-enzyme pulsed-eld gel electrophoresis (PFGE), with pattern combination UTJJPX01.098/UTJJPA26.009, and were sensitive to routinely used antibiotics. Cultures of frozen, unpas-teurized milk samples stored at dairy A from batches of milk sold during the outbreak period yielded S. Newport isolates indistinguishable by PFGE from the outbreak strain. An inspection of dairy A on May 7, 2010, did not reveal any obvious sources of contamination. On May 12, 2010, on the basis of coliform test results within legal limits, the dairy was permitted to resume sales of unpasteurized milk. Ongoing test-ing includes monthly screening for Salmonella spp. in retail samples of unpasteurized milk. As of June 21, 2010, no additional cases had been reported to UDOH. Consumption of unpasteurized dairy Announcementproducts poses a risk for foodborne illness ( 2), and consumers of unpasteurized milk should be aware of this risk.

ACIP, with support by the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC), recommends that healthcare institutions ensure that all healthcare providers have evidence of immunity to varicella. For healthcareproviders, evidence of immunity includes any of the following: Documentation of two doses of varicella vaccine; Blood tests showing immunity to varicella or laboratory confirmation of prior disease; or Receipt from a healthcare provider of a) a diagnosis of chickenpox or herpes zoster (shingles); or b) verificationof a history of chickenpox or herpes zoster (shingles). Birth before 1980 is not considered evidence of immunity for HCPs because of the potential for nosocomialtransmission of varicella to high-risk patients. Healthcare institutions should establish protocols and recommendations for screening and vaccinating HCPs and for management of HCPs after exposure in the workplace. Should HCPs be tested for varicella zoster virus (VZV) immunity prior to vaccination? Serologic screening before vaccination of personnel who have negative or uncertain history of varicella disease islikely to be cost effective. Most adults (70-90%) who do not remember having chickenpox actually have protection intheir blood when tested. Institutions may elect to test all HCPs regardless of disease history because a smallproportion of persons with a positive history of disease might be susceptible. The tests most widely used to detectvaricella IgG antibody after natural varicella infection among HCPs are latex agglutination (LA) and ELISA.Although the LA test is generally more sensitive than commercial ELISAs, a recent report indicated that the LA testcan produce false-positive results, particularly when only a single concentration of serum is evaluated. Therefore, forthe purpose of screening HCPs for varicella susceptibility, a less sensitive and more specific commercial ELISAshould be considered. Should HCPs be tested after vaccination to ensure that they are immune? The ACIP and HICPAC do not recommend routine testing of HCPs for varicella immunity after two doses of vaccine.Available commercial assays are not sensitive enough to detect antibody after vaccination in all instances. Sensitivetests have indicated that 99% of adults develop antibodies after the second dose. However, seroconversion does notalways result in full protection against disease, and no data regarding correlates of protection are available for adults. Vaccines and Immunizations 26Vaccines: VPD-VAC/Varicella/HCP FAQs See also How should vaccinated HCPs be managed after exposure to natural varicella? . (#top) Are recently vaccinated HCPs at risk for transmitting vaccine virus to susceptible persons? The risk of transmission of vaccine virus from persons who develop a varicella-like rash after vaccination is low, and has been documented only after exposures in households and long term care facilities.No cases have been documentedafter vaccination of HCPs. Moreover, the benefits of vaccinating HCPs who do not have evidence of immunityoutweigh this extremely low potential risk. As a safeguard, precautions should be taken for personnel who developrash after vaccination. These individuals should avoid contact with persons without evidence of immunity who are atrisk for severe disease and complications until all lesions resolve (i.e., crusted over or fade away) or no new lesionsappear within a period of 24 hours. How should vaccinated HCPs be managed after exposure to natural varicella? Exposed HCPs who have received 2 doses of vaccine should be monitored daily during days 10-21 after exposurethrough the employee health program or by an infection control nurse to determine clinical status (i.e., daily screeningfor fever, skin lesions, and systemic symptoms). They should also be instructed to report any symptoms as they occurwithout delay. If symptomatic, HCPs should be placed on sick leave immediately. Exposed HCPs who have received 1dose of vaccine and who are exposed to VZV should receive the second dose of vaccine within 3-5 days postexposure to rash (provided 4 weeks have elapsed after the first dose). After vaccination, management is similar to thatof 2-dose vaccine recipients described above. What is recommended for unvaccinated HCPs without evidence of immunity (Can you link this to the first question?) who are exposed to natural varicella? Unvaccinated HCPs who have no evidence of immunity and are exposed to natural varicella are potentially infective from days 10-21 after exposure and should be furloughed during this period. Postexposure vaccination isrecommended within 3-5 days of exposure to rash, since it may attenuate the disease substantially if infectionoccurred. If the exposure did not cause infection, vaccination more than 5 days after exposure is still indicated as itinduces protection against subsequent infection.

Babcock,1Nancy Gemeinhart,2Marilyn Jones,2W. Claiborne Dunagan,1,2and Keith F. Woeltje1 1Washington University School of Medicine and2BJC HealthCare, St Louis, Missouri (See the editorial commentary by Pavia, on pages 465-7.) Background. Influenza vaccination of health care workers has been recommended since 1984. Multiple strat- egies to enhance vaccination rates have been su ggested, but national ra tes have remained low. Methods. BJC HealthCare is a large Midwestern health care organization with 26,000 employees. Because organizational vaccination rates remained below target levels, influenza vaccination was made a condition of employment for all employees in 2008. Medical or religious exemptions could be requested. Predetermined medicalcontraindications include hypersensitivity to eggs, prior hypersensitivity reaction to influenza vaccine, and historyof Guillan-Barre \u00b4 syndrome. Medical exemption requests were reviewed by occupational health nurses and their medical directors. Employees who were neither vaccinated nor exempted by 15 December 2008 were not scheduledfor work. Employees still not vaccinated or exempt by 15 January 2009 were terminated. Results. Overall, 25,561 (98.4%) of 25,980 active employees were vaccinated. Ninety employees (0.3%) received religious exemptions, and 321 (1.2%) received medical exemptions. Eight employees (0.03%) were not vaccinatedor exempted. Reasons for medical exemption included allergy to eggs (107 [33%]), prior allergic reaction or allergyto other vaccine component (83 [26%]), history of Guillan-Barre \u00b4 syndrome (15 [5%]), and other (116 [36%]), including 14 because of pregnancy. Many requests reflected misinforma tion about the vaccine. Conclusions. A mandatory influenza vaccination campaign successfully increased vaccination rates. Fewer employees sought medical or religious exemptions than had signed declination statements during the previousyear. A standardized medical exemption request form would simplify the request and review process for employees,their physicians, and occupational health and will be used next year. Influenza infection is associated with 36,000 excess deaths and 1200,000 hospitalizations in the United States annually [1, 2]. It is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable death in the United States every year [3].The risk of complications associated with influenza ishigher among older persons, young children, and pa-tients with underlying medical conditions [2, 4]. In-fected people may shed virus before symptoms develop[5-8], and health care workers often work while sick.Outbreaks of influenza in hospitals have been well de-scribed [3, 4, 9-12].

In nursing home settings, vaccination of health care workers hasbeen shown to decrease morbidity and mortality among nursing home residents [16-18]. The impact of vac- cination of workers in acute care settings is more dif- cult to study because of the short duration of most hospitalizations. Other evidence for the importance ofherd immunity on influenza rates comes from a Jap-anese study in which the vaccination of school childrenagainst influenza resulted in decreased mortality asso- ciated with pneumonia or influenza in the general pop- ulation [19]. Annual influenza vaccination was rst recommended for health care workers by the Advisory Committee onImmunization Practices in 1984 [3, 20, 21]. The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology [22], the Association for Professionals in Infection Control [11], and the Infec-tious Disease Society of America [23] also strongly en-dorse health care worker vaccination. The US NationalHealth objectives for 2010 include a health care worker influenza vaccination rate of 60%. Recommended prac- 30460CID 2010:50 (15 February) Babcock et altices to improve vaccination rates include making the vaccine available without charge to employees at multiple convenientsites and times, using incentives and rewards, and having visibleleadership support [21, 24-27]. More recently, declinationstatements have been suggested as a way to increase vaccinationrates. The impact of these statements is still being studied [28-30]. Despite these efforts, vaccination rates among health careworkers remain low across the United States; the influenzavaccination rate among US health care workers during 2006-2007 was 44.4% [3]. Mandatory vaccination is a controversial strategy that pits health care worker autonomy against patient safety [31-36].Other vaccines, such as measles, mumps, and rubella vaccineand varicella vaccine, are already required by many health carefacilities, as is annual tuberculin skin testing. Virginia MasonHospital (Seattle, W A) implemented a mandatory influenza vac-cination program in 2004, and there have been media reportsof other individual hospitals instituting similar programs. Thereare no reports in the literature of large multihospital systemsimplementing a mandatory influenza vaccination policy. Annual influenza campaigns at BJC HealthCare include free vaccine available at multiple sites and times, extensive publicity,incentives and educational programs, and more recently, dec-lination statements. In 2007, influenza vaccination rates wereadded to the BJC patient safety and quality scorecard used atall hospitals in the organization. Hospital leaders receive in-centives based on their hospital's performance on scorecardmeasures. Despite signicant efforts by occupational health andinfection prevention specialists, the vaccination rate among BJCemployees remained below the BJC goal of 80%. In 2008, BJCHealthCare implemented a mandatory influenza vaccinationpolicy for all employees. METHODS Setting. BJC HealthCare is a large Midwestern health care organization with 26,000 employees. Facilities include 11 acute care hospitals and 3 extended care facilities, as well as day care centers, employed physician groups, occupationalmedicine, home care, and behavioral health services. Hospitalsare located in urban, suburban, and rural settings and rangefrom 40 to 1250 beds. Of the acute care hospitals, 1 adult and 1 pediatric facility are teaching hospitals. BJC Occupational Health Services coordinates and stan- dardizes occupational health programs through the Council ofOccupational Health Professionals, which includes a represen-tative from each facility. Bimonthly council meetings are de-signed for education, policy, and procedure standardization,coordination of occupational health and safety surveillance, anddevelopment of interventions throughout BJC. Each facilityuses the centralized BJC occupational health database for track-ing employee vaccinations, immune status, and o ccupationalinjuries and exposures. The database includes demographic andjob information on all BJC employees. 2008 Influenza policy. In 2008, as a patient safety initiative, influenza vaccination was made a condition of employment forall BJC employees, regardless of job function, including clinicaland nonclinical staff, contracted clinical personnel, and vol-unteers. Hospital-employed physicians, including hospitalists,residents, and fellows, were included in the policy. Most at-tending physicians afliated with BJC HealthCare are in privatepractice or are employed by Washington University School ofMedicine (St. Louis, MO) and are not covered by the policy. The policy was communicated to employees through their managers, with standardized educational materials and factsheets provided; an Intranet site; letters mailed to employees'homes; BJC T oday, in-house newspaper and Meetings\" scheduledthroughout the vaccination campaign with infec tious diseases physicians, infection prevention specialists, and occupational health nurses available for questions or concerns. The CEO of BJC published a letter in the BJC newspaper explaining therationale for the policy. The multidisciplinary implementationteam met regularly before and during the vaccination campaignto ensure timely, consistent, and coordinated communication and responses to any issues that arose. Free vaccine, including thimerosal-free and intranasal prep- arations, was available at multiple locations at all facilities start-ing 15 October 2008. V accinations were tracked at each facility in real time. Multiple methods of tracking vaccination were avail- able to each facility, including badge scanners, consent forms with carbon copies, a database into which managers could di-rectly enter their vaccinated employees, and preprinted labelswith bar codes. All data were entered in real time or were down-loaded regularly into the BJC occupational health database. Feed- back was provided not less than weekly to managers at the fa- cilities. Managers interacted with their staff to ascertain reasonsfor noncompliance and to provide coaching about influenza, thevaccine, and the consequences of noncompliance. Employees who were neither vaccinated nor exempted by 15 December 2008 were suspended without pay. Those who werevaccinated before 15 January 2009 could return to work. Em-ployees still not vaccinated or exempt by 15 January 2009 wereterminated for failure to meet their conditions of employment. Exemptions. Medical or religious exemptions could be re- quested. Religious accommodations required a letter from theemployee to Human Resources that stated a religious convic-tion opposed to vaccination. Employees were notied within5 days whether their request had been granted. Medical exemptions required a letter from a licensed phy- sician (MD or DO) that stated a medical contraindication toinfluenza vaccination. Predetermined accepted medical contra-indications were based on the Advisory Committee on Im- 31Mandatory Influenza Vaccination CID 2010:50 (15 February) 461Table 1. Summary of Employee Vaccination Status Vaccination statusNo. (%) of employees Vaccinated 25,561 (98.4) Religious exemption granted 90 (0.35) Medical exemption granted 321 (1.24) Egg allergy 107 Prior reaction and/or allergy to other component 83 History of Guillan-Barre \u00b4 syndrome 15 Other 116 Policy compliant (vaccinated or exempt) 25,972 (99.96) Noncompliant (neither vaccinated or exempt) 8 (0.03) T otal employees 25,980munization Practices recommendations [3]. These included hy- persensitivity to eggs, prior hypersensitivity reaction to influ-enza vaccine, and history of Guillan-Barre \u00b4 syndrome. Preg- nancy was accepted as a medical exemption if requested by theemployee's physician, despite the vaccine being recommendedduring pregnancy, because the vaccine is listed as a category Cagent. Occupational health nurses reviewed other reasons on acase-by-case basis with assistance from their medical directoras needed. Employees received a form within 5 days that statedwhether their request had been granted. Denials included anexplanation of the reason for denial on the form. Second re-quests with clarications could be submitted for review. Somephysicians who had written exemption request letters were con-tacted directly by the facility occupational health medical di-rector for clarication or at the request of the employee.Granted medical exemptions could be permanent or temporary(1 year only). Concerned employees not meeting criteria forexemption could discuss their concerns with the occupationalhealth nurses or medical directors. Employees who weregranted an exemption were encouraged to wear an isolationmask while providing patient care during the influenza seasonto avoid contracting or transmitting influenza. No specic en-forcement was put in place, and no data on compliance werecollected. RESULTS Of 25,980 active employees, 25,561 (98.4%) were vaccinated (T able 1). Medical exemptions were granted to 321 employees(1.24%). Religious accommodations were granted to 90 em-ployees (0.35%). Overall, 25,974 employees (99.96%) werecompliant with the policy (vaccinated or exempt). Only 8 em-ployees (0.03%) were terminated for noncompliance with thepolicy. At the 2 teaching hospitals, there were 907 residents andfellows in 127 graduate medical education programs. All of these trainees complied with the new policy: 902 (99.45%) werevaccinated, and 5 received exemptions (3 medical and 2 reli-gious). V accination rates in 2008 increased by 43.4%, comparedwith rates in 2006, and by 26.5%, compared with rates in 2007(Figure 1). Of 372 requested medical exemptions, 321 (86.3%) were granted (188 permanent and 133 temporary). Reasons for med- ical exemption included allergy to eggs (107 [33% of exemp-tions; 0.4% of all employees]), prior allergic reaction or allergyto other vaccine component (83 [26% of ex emptions; 0.31% of employees]), other (116 [36%]). Themajority (89 [77%]) of employees with other indications for amedical exemption received a temporary exemption: 50 for aprior vaccine reaction that was not further specied, 25 formedical reasons not further specied by their physician, and14 for pregnancy. The remaining 27 (23%) of 116 employeeswith other indications were granted permanent exemptions: 15 for a prior severe reaction to an influenza vaccine, 5 for aneurologic condition, 3 for concerns of triggering a flare of anautoimmune disease, 2 for being vegan, 1 for multiple foodsensitivities, and 1 for concern for increased risk of rejectionof a transplanted organ. Eight employees (0.03%) were not vaccinated or granted an exemption, and their employment was terminated. T wo em-ployees worked with information systems in the corporate of-ces of BJC HealthCare. The other 6 noncompliant employeeswere from 4 acute care hospitals: 1 laboratory technician, 1patient care technician, 1 paramedic, 1 nurse, 1 sitter, and 1physical therapist. The remaining hospitals and service orga-nizations had no noncompliant employees. T wo employeeswere per diem employees, 3 were part-time, and 3 were full-time employees. The median duration of employment beforetermination was 37.5 months (range, 23- 134 months). Of theseemployees, most did not submit an exemption request. Oneemployee submitted a request for a religious exemption 2 daysbefore termination, after being unable to obtain a doctor's notestating a medical contraindica tion; the request was denied. Adverse events reported by employees were tracked in the occupational health database. T wenty-one employees (0.08%)reported a possible adverse reaction. Eleven reported a sorearm. Five reported a possible allergic reaction, and 1 reporteda possible vagal response with fainting. Four events of uncertainrelation to the vaccine were also reported by employees, in-cluding 2 cases of fever and myalgias, 1 with upper respiratorysymptoms, and 1 case of a new neurologic syndrome diagnosedas chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, whichcould not be objectively linked to the influenza vaccine becauseof several other potential antecedent triggers. DISCUSSION The mandatory vaccination program successfully increased vac- cination rates at a large multihospital health care organization.Efforts during previous years included most recommended 32462CID 2010:50 (15 February) Babcock et al Figure 1. BJC HealthCare annual influenza vaccination rates (percentage of total employees). The National Health Interview Survey rates of influenza vaccination among health care workers during 1997-2006 are shown with the trend line. practices to maximize vaccination rates, including free, easily available vaccine, incentives, and leadership support. Despitethese efforts, rates were still suboptimal (Figure 1). The man-datory program markedly increased vaccination rates across allfacilities. Key factors that supported the success of the programincluded consistent communication emphasizing patient safetyand quality of care, coordinated campaigns, leadership support,and medical director support to talk with any employee withconcerns about the vaccine, on request. The program was es-tablished as a patient safety initiative; thus, no prospective at-tempts were made to link to absenteeism. Because of the waythat employees are reimbursed for time off work, we wereunable to distinguish between sick time and vacation time and,thus, could not assess the impact of the program on absentee-ism. In addition, the year that the program was implementedhad a mild influenza season; therefore, nding reduced absen-teeism would be difcult to lin k to the vaccination program. Few other organizations have established mandatory influ- enza vaccination programs. Virginia Mason Hospital imple- mented a mandatory program in 2004, with resulting vacci-nation rates of 198%. Several smaller hospitals were mentioned in the media for attempting mandatory campaigns, but nodetails have been published. T o our knowledge, this is the rstreport of a large multihospital health care organization imple-menting a mandatory influenz a vaccination program. Some programs allow health care workers to sign declination forms stating that they understand the risks of not receivingthe influenza vaccine to themselves, their patients, and theirfamilies. Declination statements have recently been publicizedas a potentially valuable strategy for increasing vaccination rates[11, 21, 22], but data on their efcacy are mixed [28-30]. W efound that many fewer employees sought medical or religiousexemptions than had signed declination statements in previousyears. Requests for religious exemptions were reviewed by Hu-man Resources at each facility. The letter from the employeehad to state a sincere religious conviction opposed to vaccination.Some requests were only submitted after medical exemption re-quests had been denied, and some requests stated opposition toa mandatory policy, not to vaccination itself. These requests weredenied. Severe egg allergy is a contraindication to receipt of the in- fluenza vaccine [3]. Virginia Mason Hospital provides free, on-site egg allergy testing for employees seeking an exemption onthe basis of egg allergy. Our organization did not attempt toverify reports of signicant egg allergy or allergy to other vac-cine components. Egg allergy rates decrease with age, and re-ported rates in the medical literature range from 0% to 0.35%[37-39]. Overall, 107 (0.4%) of all employees reported a sig-nicant egg allergy. Exemption requests often reflected misinformation about the vaccine and about influenza among employees and among theirphysicians. Several requests cited chemotherapy or an immu-nosuppressed state as reasons not to get the vaccine, even thoughthese groups are at high risk for complications from influenzaand are specically recommended to be vaccinated. Several re-quests cited pregnancy, although the vaccine is recommendedduring pregnancy [3, 40]. Other requests did not include enoughinformation to make a determination of the validity of the re-quest. Some health care workers whose initial request for ex-emption was denied returned to their personal physician for amore detailed note or requested that occupational health contacttheir physician to discuss their request. Some community phy-sicians felt beleaguered by these multiple contacts. A standardizedform listing accepted contraindications and their denitions, with 33Mandatory Influenza Vaccination CID 2010:50 (15 February) 463checkboxes and space for additional information and contact information, would simplify the request and review process forhealth care workers, their physicians, and occupational healthstaff. BJC HealthCare benetted from strong leadership support for this initiative and a solid infrastructure for timely and con-sistent communication. The experience at our organization maynot be completely generalizable. Economic factors at the timeof the study may have limited the number of employees willingto lose their jobs. Influenza vaccination rates increased in 2007(Figure 1) and may have continued to increase even withouta mandatory vaccination policy, although we believe that sucha dramatic increase would have been unlikely. Not all physiciansafliated with BJC HealthCare are employees of the organi-zation and, thus, were not covered by the policy. All physiciansemployed by the organization, however, including 900 resi- dents and fellows, complied with the policy. In conclusion, amandatory influenza vaccination policy was successful in in-creasing vaccination rates at a large multihospital health careorganization with 26,000 employees.

There is \"ongoing debate\" about the e fficacy of surgical masks versus N95 respirators for influenza A (H1N1) p rotection, Brenda Sze Peng Ang, MD, from the Department of Infectious Di seases, Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), Singapore, and colleagues note in their report. Optim al respiratory protection against the virus \"remains controversial, and randomized, controlled trials have yet to be done.\" To learn more about the comparative efficacy of surgical masks and N95 respirators in protecting healthcare workers from H1N1, Dr. Ang and colleagues analyzed the incidence of H1N1 among healthcare workers from April 25 through August 31, 2009, at TTS H. The hospital is designated by the Ministry of Health to manage ou tbreaks of emerging infection and has \"robust surveillance systems to detect infection in staff,\" the investigators note in their report. The first case of pandemic H1N1 in Si ngapore was identified on May 26, 2009, and from April 25 to June 18, when there was no local transmission of H1N1, 2154 patients with acute respiratory infection (ARI) and 58 with confirmed pandemic H1N1 were treated at TTSH. A total of 573 healthcare workers reported having ARI, but none had pandemic H1N1. From June 19 to July 21, local tran smission of H1N1 had occurred and healthcare workers at TTSH were usi ng N95 respirators in the emergency room and an H1N1 isolation area. Duri ng this time, 5301 patients with ARI and 689 with confirmed H1N1 were treated at the hospital, and 1065 healthcare workers reported having ARI. 36From July 22 to August 31, when there was continued local transmission of H1N1, surgical masks were worn by healthcare personnel in the emergency department and the isolation facility. During this period, 2694 patients with ARI and 424 patients with H1N1 were treated at TTSH. There were 955 healthcare workers with ARI and 15 confirmed cases of H1N1 during this time. Dr. Ang and colleagues observed that the incidence of H1N1 remained low when healthcare workers were using N95 masks and when they were using ordinary surgical masks, suggesting, they say, that surgical masks and respirators did not differ in their eff ectiveness in preventing hospital staff from acquiring H1N1. Actually, however, there were fewe r ARI and H1N1 cases among staff when surgical masks were being worn than when N95 respirators were being worn at the hospital, Dr. Ang and colleagues point out. \"What is more important than using high-filtration or respirator masks for known or suspected cases is to have a uni form policy, such as using surgical masks, when in close contact with a ll patients,\" Dr. Ang noted in a written statement. \"This way, health care workers are protected from getting infected by patients not initia lly thought to have H1N1.\" According to the researchers, none of the healthcare workers who cared for patients with known H1N1 infection acquired infection from them. Those healthcare workers who did acquire pa ndemic H1N1 \"appeared to have been infected from community exposure or in social settings with colleagues,\" they note. The authors have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. Clin Infect Dis . 2010;50:1011-1014. Abstract 37HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU MEASURE UP?MEASURE UP?

Health care workers infected with influenza can spread the virus to patients in their care.2-4In fact, research suggests that health care workers can be a key source of institutional outbreaks, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality among vulnerable patients.1Health care workers encounter patients throughout the influenza season in a variety of settings, including medical practices, general hospitals, specialty hospitals, pediatric hospitals,5,6long-term care facilities,7emergency departments,8ambulatory care settings, rehabilitation facilities and home-care sites. Vaccination is the primary means of reducing tr ansmission and preventing influenza infection, yet immunization rates among health care workers remain low. Only 36 percent of workers who have direct contact with patients are immunized annually, despite long-standing recommendations issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Association for Professionals in Infection Contr ol and Epidemiology (APIC) and other national health care organizations.1,9,10 Greater emphasis needs to be placed on improvi ng influenza immunization rates among health care workers to help ensure patient safety and protection\u2014especially for patients at increased risk of influenza-related complications.7Immunization also provides personal protection for health care workers and minimizes workforce absenteeism during the influenza season.11 TRANSMISSION Influenza is transmitted by direct and indirect contact and by droplet contact. There may be an airborne component to transmission as well. Th erefore, the virus is easily spread from person to person via coughing, sneezing, and contact wi th contaminated items and surfaces. The virus can spread rapidly, especially in classr ooms, households, offices, and medical settings. Individuals are generally infectious 1-4 day s before the onset of symptoms; however, only around 50% of infected persons will develop classica l symptoms of influenza, making exclusion of infected health care workers difficult. 1,12Moreover, individuals remain infectious five or more days after symptoms appear. Studies show heal th care personnel are more likely than staff in other areas to work through or return to work so oner during illness, thus increasing the likelihood of transmitting the virus to patients.13TEMPLATE POLICY STATEMENT 42INSTITUTIONAL INFLUENZA OUTBREAKS Institutional influenza outbreaks can have seri ous implications for both the patient and health care provider. These events can put patients at risk, result in or exacerbate existing staff shortages, curtail admissions, and increase health care costs. An outbreak in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in the year 2000 included 19 infants, one of whom died. Only 15 percent of staff in the facility had been immunized against influenza. Although investigators could not pinpoint the source of the outbreak, a health care worker was the suspected source; since influenza-like-ill ness was not found in the mothers of these infants. 14 A 2001 report documented an outbreak that included four influenza cases among patients in a 12-bed, single-room transplant unit. Three of the four affected patients had no visitors between admission and influenza infection to account for the spread. Investigators concluded that health care workers were the likely source of transmission. 15 A very large outbreak in the early 1990s occurre d in a nursing home in New York. Nineteen percent of residents developed influenza. A total of 34 individuals developed pneumonia; 19 were hospitalized, and two died. In this facility, only 10 percent of health care workers were immunized. 16 While index cases are not always identifiabl e, health care workers can easily propagate an outbreak as they move from patient to patient. It is also clear that unvaccinated health care workers can be the index case for influenza in a facility, potentially posing a threat to high-risk patients and other workers. ECONOMIC IMPACT OF OUTBREAKS Influenza outbreaks are associated with substantial dire ct and indirect costs. An outbreak in an internal medicine ward of a French hospital in 1999, in which 41 percent of patients and 23 percent of staff were infected, resulted in 14 days of staff sick leave and suspension of all admissions to the ward, including eight that were previously scheduled. The total cost of the outbreak in this small ward was estimated at $34,000 (U.S. dollars). 17Amantadine resistance was documented in a small pediatric NICU outbreak. Oseltamivir, an expensive alternative therapy, was used to halt the outbreak instead. In a bone marrow transplant unit, Oseltamivir was also used in place of prophylactic am antadine during an outbreak because concomitant use of immuno-suppressant therapy and amantadine has been shown to increase the incidence of patient falls, which could have had dire consequences in these patients. 18 Ensuring the health and safety of health care work ers has additional implications for patient safety and health care cost containment. Hiring replacement workers often means assuming additional costs beyond those associated with salary . Studies show that using pool staff in place of experienced unit staff in creases the incidence of medica l errors. On occasions when staff members work a double shift, it has been shown that attention decreases after 12 hours of work. 19 ROLE OF HEALTH CARE FACILITIESHealth care facilities have an important role to play in maximizing influenza vaccination rates among health care workers. Every facilit y should develop and implement comprehensive influenza vaccination programs for employees. 8,9 43RECOMMENDATIONS [NAME OF INSTITUTION] recommends the fo llowing measures be implemented to increase influenza immunization rates among its health care workers and improve patient safety and personal health. xHealth care workers should receive an annual influenza immunization to prevent spread of the virus to vulnerable patients. xDevelop an influenza immunization program that is implemented annually, to oEducate health care workers about the im portance of influenza immunization in health care settings and the low risk of adverse events associated with immunization;20 oIncrease vaccine demand among health care workers; oReduce barriers to immunization of health care workers by developing programs that increase access to immuni zation and reduce the cost of the vaccine; 21and oFacilitate the influenza vaccination process, for example, through the use of standing orders issued by the Occupational Health Program for influenza vaccination of health care workers. xMonitor annual immunization rates of employees and provide feedback through the infection control and patient safety programs. xMonitor and track influenza rates among health care workers and compare those figures to this group's immunization rates. Providing this information may stimulate health care workers to seek vaccination. xWork with public health officials to track co mmunity incidence of influenza, using data from emergency rooms, physicians' offices, and clinics. As the incidence increases, infection control and hospital administrati on should work together to identify pending admissions of potential influenza cases and to establish parameters for visitor restrictions. 44References 1.

Seasonal influenza (flu) is a contagious viral infection of the nose, throat and lungs that usually occurs in the fall and winter months and can cause severe illness. In the Northern Hemisphere, influenza activity generally occurs during December - March, but activity can occur as early as October and as late as May occasionally, but usually in limited areas. Influenza is thought to be spread from person to person, primarily wh en an infected person coughs or sneezes. Influenza may lead to hospitalization or even death, especially among the elderly. On average, each year between 5 percent and 20 percent of the population contract influenza, more than 200,000 are hospitalized, and 36,000 die from seasonal influenza-related complications annually. This flu season could be worse. There is a new and very different flu virus spreading worldwide among people called novel H1N1 flu . This virus may cause more illness or more severe illness than usual. Vaccines are the best tool we have to prevent influenza; however, the seasonal flu vaccine is unlikely to provide protection against novel H1N1 influenza. However a novel H1N1 vaccine is currently in production and may be ready for the public in the fall. The novel H1N1 vaccine is not intended to replace the seasonal flu vaccine - it is intended to be used along-side seasonal flu vaccine. Who should get season al influenza vaccine? Summary of seasonal influenza vaccination recommendations for adults Annual vaccination against seasonal influenza is recommended for any adult who wants to reduce the risk for becoming ill with influenza or of transmitting it to others. Vaccination also is recommended for all adults in the following groups, because these persons are either at high risk for influenza complications, or are close contacts of persons at high risk: Persons 50 years of age or older; Women who will be pregnant during the influenza season; Persons who have chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension), renal, hepatic, hematological or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus); Persons who have immunosuppression (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus); Persons who have any condition (e.g., cognitivie dysfunction, spinal cord injuries, seizure disorders, or other neuromuscular disorders) that can compromise respiratory function or the handling of respiratory secretions or that can increase the risk for aspiration; Residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities; Health care personnel; Household contacts and caregivers of children younger than 5 years of age and adults 50 years of age and older, with particular emphasis on vaccinating contacts of children younger than 6 months of age; and, Household contacts and caregivers of persons with medical conditions that put them at high risk for severe complications from influenza. Symptoms Typical seasonal influenza illness is characterized by the abrupt onset of fever, chills, cough, headache, ru nny nose, sore throat, and muscle and joint pain. Unlike other common respiratory infections that are often called \"the flu,\" influenza can cause more severe illness that can result in complications leading to hospitalization and death. However, persons with mild symptoms such as cough and mild fever can also have an infection with influenza virus, and symptoms can be similar to those caused by other respiratory viruses. Persons with mild symptoms can still transmit influenza virus to others, including to persons at risk for more seve re influenza virus infections. Prevention Getting a seasonal flu vaccine is the best way to prevent influenza. The time to vaccinate is as soon as vaccine is available and throughout the influenza season. Because the flu vaccine is updated every year to keep up with changes in circulating flu viruses and because immunity to influenz a viruses dec lines within a year after vaccination, it is important to get vaccinated against influenza every year. 48Facts About Seasonal Influenza for Adults National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003 Web site: www.nfid.org August 2009 Summary of seasonal influenza vaccination recommendations for children and adolescents aged 6 months - 18 years Vaccination of all children aged 6 months - 18 years is recommended for the 2009-10 influenza season. Children and adolescents at high risk for influenza complications should continue to be a focus of vaccination efforts as providers and programs transition to routinely vaccinating all children and adolescents. Children and adolescents at higher risk for influenza complications are those: Aged 6 months up to their 5 th birthday Who have chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension), renal, hepatic, hematological or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus); Who are immunosuppressed (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus) Who have any c ondition (e.g., cognitive dysfunction, spinal cord injuri es, seizure disorders, or other neuromuscular disorders) that can compromise respiratory function or the handling of respiratory secretions or that can increase the risk for aspiration; Who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy, who therefore, might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection; Who are residents of chronic-care facilities; and, Who will be pregnant during the influenza season. Children and adolescents who are household contacts of any of the high risk groups above are also recommended for annual vaccination. Note: Children younger than 6 months of age are the pediatric group at highest risk of seasonal influenza complications, yet they are too young to receive the influenza vaccine. The best way to protect these children is to vaccinate their close contacts, including siblings and out of home care givers, against seasonal influenza. Vaccine Safety Two different types of seasonal in fluenza vaccine are available. Injected vaccine The injected influenza vaccine can be given to persons 6 months of age and older. It is usually given as a shot in the upper arm or in the thigh. There may be some mild soreness, redness or swelling at the injection site which may last 1 to 2 days. Other possible mild side effects include a headache and low-grade fever for a day after vaccination. Intranasal vaccine The intranasal vaccine can be gi ven to healthy persons 2 to 49 years of age, but should not be given to persons with chronic medical conditions. In addition, it should not be given to pregnant women or to persons who are in close contact with severely immune-suppressed persons. There may be a runny nose, headache, low-grade fever, sore throat, fatigue or cough after vaccination 49Facts About Seasonal Influenza for Adults National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003 Web site: www.nfid.org August 2009 Two different types of seasonal influenza vaccine are available: injectable inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) administered as a nasal spray. TIV is recommended for use by people 6 months of age of age and older with or without chronic medical conditions. LAIV is recommended for healthy people 2 to 49 years of age. Recommendations for the use of both vaccines are posted on the Web site of the Centers for Diseas e Control and Prevention, http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/ACIP-list.htm. FACT: Influenza can be prevented with safe, effective vaccines . FACT: To protect infants younger than 6 months of age from influenza and its complications, adults, other household members, and out-of-home caregivers of these children should be vaccinated. FACT: Each year, on average, 36,000 people in the United States die from seasonal influenza complications, including an average of about 100 deaths each year in children younger than 5 years of age. Greater than 90% of deaths occur in persons 65 years of age and older. FACT: During the 1990's, an average of more than 200,000 people were hospitalized each year for influenza-related complications. FACT: Total direct hospitalization costs of a severe influenza epidemic are estimated to be over $3 billion. FACT: Inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine is paid for by Medicare Part B. FACT: Because influenza viruses can change from year to year and because protection from the vaccine does not last more than one year, annual influenza vaccination is necessary. FACT: Influenza vaccine does not protect against resp iratory infections caused by viruses other than influenza. Many respiratory illnesses are often called \"the flu\", but only some of these illnesses are actually caused by the influenza virus. FACT: Influenza can worsen chronic heart disease, lung disease and diabetes, and can lead to bacterial or viral pneumonia. FACT: In most influenza seasons, 5-20% of the U.S. population will be infected with seasonal influenza virus. These infec tions typically cause the infected person to miss work or school, or be ill while on vacation. FACT: Anyone who wants to avoid becoming ill with influenza or transmitting it to others should get vaccinated. FACT: Most persons who are recommended for vaccination do not get vaccinated. 50LIVE, INTRANASAL INFLUENZA W H A T Y O U N E E D T O K N O W VACCINE Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and many other languages. See http://www.immunize.org/vis Hojas de (\"flu\") is a contagious disease. It is caused by the influenza virus, which can be spread by coughing, sneezing, or nasal secretions. Anyone can get influenza, but rates of infection are highest among children. For most people, symptoms lasts only a few days. They include: \u0081 fever \u0081 sore throat \u0081 chills \u0081 fatigue \u0081 cough \u0081 headache \u0081 muscle aches Other illnesses can have the same symptoms and are often mistaken for influenza. Infants, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with certain health conditions - such as heart, lung or kidney disease or a weakened immune system - can get much sicker. Influenzacan cause high fever and pneumonia, and make existing medical conditions worse. It can cause diarrhea and seizures in children. Each year thousands of people die from seasonal influenza and even more require hospitalization. By getting vaccinated you can protect yourself from influenza and may also avoid spreading influenza to others. Live, attenuated influenza vaccine - LAIV (nasal spray)2 attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) contains live but attenuated (weakened) influenza virus. It is sprayed into the nostrils. 2.Inactivated (killed) influenza vaccine, or the \"flu shot,\" is given by injection into the muscle. This vaccine is described in a separate Vaccine Information Statement. Influenza viruses are always changing, so annual vaccination is recommended. Each year scientists try to match the viruses in the vaccine to those most likely to cause flu that year. The 2010 - 2011 vaccine provides protection against A/H1N1 (pandemic) influenza and two other influenza viruses- influenza A/H3N2 and influenza B. It will not prevent illness caused by other viruses. It takes up to 2 weeks for protection to develop after the vaccination. Protection lasts about a year. LAIV does not contain thimerosal or other preservatives. Who can receive LAIV?3 LAIV is recommended for healthy people 2 through 49 years of age, who are not pregnant and do not have certain health conditions (see #4, below). People who got the 2009 H1N1 (pandemic) infl uenza vaccine, or had pandemic flu in 2009, should still get the 2010-2011 seasonal infl uenza vaccine. Some people should not receive LAIV4 LAIV is not recommended for everyone. The following people should get the inactivated vaccine (flu shot) instead: \u0081 Adults 50 years of age and older or children from 6 through 23 months of age . (Children younger than 6 months should not get either infl uenza vaccine.) \u0081 Children younger than 5 years with asthma or one or more episodes of wheezing within the past year. \u0081 Pregnant women. \u0081 People who have long-term health problems with: - heart disease - kidney or liver disease - lung disease - metabolic disease, such as diabetes - asthma - anemia, and other blood disorders \u0081 Anyone with certain muscle or nerve disorders (such as seizure disorders or cerebral palsy) that can lead to breathing or swallowing problems. \u0081 Anyone with a weakened immune system. \u0081 Anyone in close contact with someone whose immune system is so weak they require care in a protected environment (such as a bone marrow transplant unit). Close contacts of other people with a weakened immune system (such as those with HIV) may receive LAIV . Healthcare personnel in neonatal intensive care units or oncology clinics may receive LAIV . \u0081 Children or adolescents on long-term aspirin treatment. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any severe (life- threatening) allergies. Allergic reactions to infl uenza vaccine are rare. - Influenza vaccine virus is grown in eggs. People with a severe egg allergy should not get infl uenza vaccine. - A severe allergy to any vaccine component is also a reason not to get the vaccine. - If you ever had a severe reaction after a dose of influenza vaccine, tell your healthcare provider. 51Tell your healthcare provider if you ever had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (a severe paralytic illness, also called GBS). Your provider will help you decide whether the vaccine is recommended for you. Tell your healthcare provider if you have gotten any other vaccines in the past 4 weeks. Anyone with a nasal condition serious enough to make breathing difcult, such as a very stuffy nose, should get the flu shot instead. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting flu vaccine. If you are ill, talk to your healthcare provider about whether to reschedule the vaccination. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine. When should I receive infl uenza vaccine? 5 Getting the vaccine as soon as it is available will provide protection if the flu season comes early. You can get the vaccine as long as illness is occurring in your community. Influenza can occur any time, but most influenza occurs from November through May. In recent seasons, most infections have occured in January and February. Getting vaccinated in December, or even later, will still be benecial in most years. Adults and older children need one dose of infl uenza vaccine each year. But some children younger than 9 years of age need two doses to be protected. Ask your healthcare provider. Influenza vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. What are the risks from LAIV?6 A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Live influenza vaccine viruses very rarely spread from person to person. Even if they do, they are not likely to cause illness. LAIV is made from weakened virus and does not cause influenza. The vaccine can cause mild symptoms in people who get it (see below). Mild problems: Some children and adolescents 2-17 years of age have reported: \u0081 runny nose, nasal congestion or coug \u0081 fever \u0081 headache and muscle aches \u0081 wheezing \u0081 abdominal pain or occasional vomiting or diarrhea Some adults 18-49 years of age have reported: \u0081 runny nose or nasal congestion \u0081 sore throat h Severe problems: \u0081 Life-threatening aller gic reactions from vaccines are very rare. If they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination. \u0081 If rare reactions occur with any product, they may not be identied until thousands, or millions, of people have used it. Millions of doses of LAIV have been distributed since it was licensed, and the vaccine has not been associated with any serious problems. The safety of vaccines is always being monitored.

See http://www.immunize.org/vis Hojas de Infl uenza (\"flu\") is a contagious disease. It is caused by the influenza virus, which can be spread by coughing, sneezing, or nasal secretions. Anyone can get influenza, but rates of infection are highest among children. For most people, symptoms last only a few days. They include: \u0081 fever \u0081 sore throat \u0081 chills \u0081 fatigue \u0081 cough \u0081 headache \u0081 muscle aches Other illnesses can have the same symptoms and are often mistaken for influenza. Infants, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with certain health conditions - such as heart, lung or kidney disease or a weakened immune system - can get much sicker. Flu can cause high fever and pneumonia, and make existing medical conditions worse. It can cause diarrhea and seizures in children. Each year thousands of people die from seasonal influenza and even more require hospitalization. By getting vaccinated you can protect yourself from influenza and may also avoid spreading influenza to others. Inactivated infl uenza vaccine 2 There are two types of uenza vaccine: 1.Inactivated (killed) vaccine, or the \"flu shot\" is given by injection into the muscle. 2.Live, attenuated (weakened) influenza vaccine is sprayed into the nostrils. This vaccine is described in a separate Vaccine Information Statement. A \"high-dose\" inactivated influenza vaccine is available for people 65 years of age and older. Ask your healthcare provider for more information. Influenza viruses are always changing, so annual vaccination is recommended. Each year scientists try to match the viruses in the vaccine to those most likely to cause flu that year. The 2010-2011 vaccine provides protection against A/H1N1 (pandemic) influenza and two other influenza viruses - influenza A/H3N2 and influenza B. It will not prevent illness caused by other viruses. It takes up to 2 weeks for protection to develop after the shot. Protection lasts about a year. Some inactivated influenza vaccine contains a preservative called thimerosal. Thimerosal-free influenza vaccine is available. Ask your healthcare provider for more information. Who should get inactivated3influenza vaccine and when? WHO All people 6 months of age and older should get flu vaccine. Vaccination is especially important for people at higher risk of severe influenza and their close contacts, including healthcare personnel and close contacts of children younger than 6 months. People who got the 2009 H1N1 (pandemic) influenza vaccine, or had pandemic fl u in 2009, should still get the 2010-2011 seasonal infl uenza vaccine. WHEN Getting the vaccine as soon as it is available will provide protection if the flu season comes early. You can get the vaccine as long as illness is occurring in your community. Influenza can occur at any time, but most infl uenza occurs from November through May. In recent seasons, most infections have occurred in January and February. Getting vaccinated in December, or even later, will still be benecial in most years. Adults and older children need one dose of influenza vaccine each year. But some children younger than 9 years of age need two doses to be protected. Ask your healthcare provider. Influenza vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines, including pneumococcal vaccine. Some people should not get inactivated influenza vaccine or should wait 4 \u0081 Tell your healthcare provider if you have any severe (life-threatening) allergies. Allergic reactions to influenza vaccine are rare. 535 -Influenza vaccine virus is grown in eggs. People with a severe egg allergy should not get infl uenza vaccine. -A severe allergy to any vaccine component is also a reason not to get the vaccine. -If you ever had a severe reaction after a dose of influenza vaccine, tell your healthcare provider. \u0081 Tell your healthcare provider if you ever had Guillain- Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (a severe paralytic illness, also called GBS). Your provider will help you decide whether the vaccine is recommended for you. \u0081 People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting flu vaccine. If you are ill, talk to your healthcare provider about whether to reschedule the vaccination. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine. What are the risks from inactivated infl uenza vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Serious problems from inactivated influenza vaccine are very rare. The viruses in inactivated influenza vaccine have been killed, so you cannot get influenza from the vaccine. Mild problems: \u0081 soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given \u0081 hoarseness; sore, red or itchy eyes; cough \u0081 fever \u0081 aches If these problems occur, they usually begin soon after the shot and last 1-2 days. Severe problems: \u0081 Life-threatening allergic reactions from vaccines are very rare. If they do occur, it is usually within a few minutes to a few hours after the shot. \u0081 In 1976, a type of inactivated infl uenza (swine flu) vaccine was associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). Since then, flu vaccines have not been clearly linked to GBS. However, if there is a risk of GBS from current flu vaccines, it would be no more than 1 or 2 cases per million people vaccinated. This is much lower than the risk of severe influenza, which can be prevented by vaccination. One brand of inactivated flu vaccine, called Afluria, should not be given to children 8 years of age or younger, except in special circumstances. A related vaccine was associated with fevers and fever-related seizures in young children in Australia. Ask your healthcare provider for more information. The safety of vaccines is always being monitored.

Web site: www.nfid.org August 2009 What is hepatitis B? Hepatitis B is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis B viru s (HBV). The virus can affect people of all ages. Once inf ected, some people are never able to rid themselves of the virus. This long-term or \"chronic\" HBV infection can lead to liver cirrhosi s, liver cancer and death. The virus is found in the blood and body fluids of infected people and is most often spread among adult s through sexual contact or by sharing needles and other drug paraphernalia with an infected person. HBV can also be spread through normal household contact with HBV-infected persons, or by passage of the virus from an HBV-infected mother to her infant during birth. Symptoms Hepatitis B can often be a \"silent disease\" that affects people wit hout making them feel sick; th is is more common among childr en. People who do get sick from hepatitis B might experience loss of appetite, tiredness, stomachache, nausea and vomiting. They might also experience yellowing of the whites of the eyes (jaundice) and/or joint pain. People with chronic HBV infection usual ly do not feel sick for many years, but will have symptoms if th ey develop the most serious complications from hepatitis B, like cirrhosis or liver cancer. Treatment There is no specific treatment for newly ac quired HBV infection. Medicines are available to treat people with chronic hepatitis B. These medicines work for some people, but not for all. Prevention Safe, effective hepatitis B vaccines are available. The vaccines are used to protect everyone from newborn babies to older adul ts. The vaccination series is usually given as three doses over a six-month period. However, more flexible schedules can be used. Hepatitis B vaccine is recognized as the fi rst anti-cancer vaccine becau se it can prevent liver cancer caused by chronic HBV infection. Who should get hepatitis B vaccine? /.notdef.g0001 All children and adolescents from birth through 18 years of age. /.notdef.g0001 Persons at risk of sexual HBV transmission: men and women who have had more than one sex partner during the previous six months or who have had a recently acquired sexually transmitted disease (STD); men who have sex with men; and persons receiving treatment for STDs, and persons with HIV infection. /.notdef.g0001 Persons at risk of HBV tran smission by percutaneous or mucosal exposure to blood: people whose jobs potentially expose them to human blood or blood-contaminated body fluids, including most healthcare workers and some public safety workers; injection drug users; and persons with end-stage kidney disease. /.notdef.g0001 People living with or having sexual contact with a person who has chronic HBV infection. /.notdef.g0001 Travelers who live or work for at le ast six months in areas where HBV inf ection is of high or intermediate endemicity, or who stay for shorter periods and will likely have contact with blood (e.g., in a medical setting) or sexual contact with local persons. /.notdef.g0001 Inmates of correctiona l facilities, including all i nmates who receive a medical eval uation in federal and state prisons, jails, and juvenile correction facilities. /.notdef.g0001 Residents and staff of institutions and nonresidential daycare facilities for developmentally disabled persons. /.notdef.g0001 People with chronic liver dise ase including hepatitis C. /.notdef.g0001 All adults requesting protection from HBV infection.

Web site: www.nfid.org August 2009 FACT: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can be prevented with a safe and effective vaccine. FACT: You cannot get hepatitis B from the hepatitis B vaccine. FACT: During the 1970s and 1980s, 200,000 to 300,000 persons were infected with HBV each year in the United States. FACT: Hepatitis B incidence has declined substantially since 1991 when a strategy to eliminate HBV transmission through immunization began to be implemented. The decline in incidence has been greatest among children and adolescents, who are recommended to be routinely vaccinated against hepatitis B. FACT: In 2007, rates of new cases of acute hepatitis B were highest among adults aged 30 - 44 years of age. FACT: More than 50% of new hepatitis B cases could be prevented if hepatitis B vaccination were routinely offered to all persons attending sexually transmitted disease clinics and to all correctional facility inmates. FACT : About 42% of adults who become infected with HBV have a risk factor for infection in 2007. FACT : Even if a person infected with HBV does not feel sick, he or she can still infect others. FACT : HBV infection can result in chronic (life-long) infection that increases a person's risk of developing chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. FACT : An estimated 800,000- 1.4 million people in the United States have chronic HBV infection. FACT : HBV infection kills about 2,000 to 4,000 people in the United States each year, usually as the result of complications from chronic liver disease. FACT : HBV is found in blood and other body fluids such as semen and vaginal secretions. The hepatitis B virus is 100 times more infectious than HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. FACT : Hepatitis B is a sexually-transmitted disease but can also be transmitted during normal household contact with an infected person. FACT : The hepatitis B vaccine is the first vaccine that prevents a form of cancer \u2014 liver cancer. FACT : Infants born to HBV-infected women have a very high chance of getting HBV infection from their mothers unless they receive their first hepatitis B vaccination at birth. Vaccine Safety Hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective. You cannot get hepatitis B from the vaccine. The most common side effect of the vaccine is soreness at the injection site. As with any medicine, there are very small risks that serious problems could occur after getting the vaccine. However, the potential risks associated with hepatitis B disease are much greater than the potential risks associated with the hepatitis B vaccine. 60HEPATITIS B VACCINE W H A T Y O U N E E D T O K N O W Many Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages. See www.immunize.org/vis. 1What is hepatitis B? Hepatitis B is a serious disease that affects the liver. It is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV can cause: Acute (short-term) illness. This can lead to: loss of appetite diarrhea and vomiting tiredness jaundice (yellow skin or eyes) pain in muscles, joints, and stomach Acute illness is more common among adults. Children who become infected usually do not haveacute illness. Chronic (long-term) infection. Some people go on to develop chronic HBV infection. This can be very serious, and often leads to: liver damage (cirrhosis) liver cancer death Chronic infection is more common among infants and children than among adults. People who are infected can spread HBV to others, even if they don't appear sick. In 2005, about 51,000 people became infected with hepatitis B. About 1.25 million people in the United States have chronic HBV infection. Each year about 3,000 to 5,000 people die from cirrhosis or liver cancer caused by HBV . Hepatitis B virus is spread through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. A person can become infected by: - contact with a mother's blood and body fluids at the time of birth; - contact with blood and body fluids through breaks in the skin such as bites, cuts, or sores; - contact with objects that could have blood or body fluids on them such as toothbrushes or razors; - having unprotected sex with an infected person; - sharing needles when injecting drugs; - being stuck with a used needle on the job. 2Hepatitis B vaccine: Why get vaccinated? Hepatitis B vaccine can prevent hepatitis B, and the serious consequences of HBV infection, including liver cancer and cirrhosis. Routine hepatitis B vaccination of U.S. children began in 1991. Since then, the reported incidence of acute hepatitis B among children and adolescents has dropped by more than 95% - and by 75% in all age groups. Hepatitis B vaccine is made from a part of the hepatitis B virus. It cannot cause HBV infection. Hepatitis B vaccine is usually given as a series of 3 or 4 shots. This vaccine series gives long-term protection from HBV infection, possibly lifelong. 3Who should get hepatitis B vaccine and when? Children and Adolescents All children should get their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth and should have completed the vaccine series by 6-18 months of age. Children and adolescents through 18 years of age who did not get the vaccine when they were younger should also be vaccinated. Adults All unvaccinated adults at risk for HBV infection should be vaccinated. This includes: - sex partners of people infected with HBV , - men who have sex with men, - people who inject street drugs, - people with more than one sex partner, - people with chronic liver or kidney disease, - people with jobs that expose them to human blood, - household contacts of people infected with HBV , - residents and staff in institutions for the developmentally disabled, - kidney dialysis patients, 61- people who travel to countries where hepatitis B is common, - people with HIV infection. Anyone else who wants to be protected from HBV infection may be vaccinated. 4Who should NOT get hepatitis B vaccine? Anyone with a life-threatening allergy to baker's yeast, or to any other component of the vaccine, should not get hepatitis B vaccine. T ell your provider if you have any severe allergies. Anyone who has had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of hepatitis B vaccineshould not get another dose. Anyone who is moderately or severely ill when a dose of vaccine is scheduled should probably wait until they recover before getting the vaccine. Y our provider can give you more information about these precautions. Pregnant women who need protection from HBV infection may be vaccinated. 5Hepatitis B vaccine risks Hepatitis B is a very safe vaccine. Most people do not have any problems with it. The following mild problems have been reported: Soreness where the shot was given (up to about 1 person in 4). T emperature of 99.9\u00b0F or higher (up to about 1 person in 15). Severe problems are extremely rare. Severe allergic reactions are believed to occur about once in 1.1 million doses. A vaccine, like any medicine, could cause a serious reaction. But the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. More than 100 million people have gotten hepatitis B vaccine in theUnited States. 6What if there is a moderate or severe reaction? What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever or behavior changes. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarse- ness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. T ell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your doctor, nurse, or health department to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does not provide medical advice. 7The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program In the event that you or your child has a serious reaction to a vaccine, a federal program has been created to help pay for the care of those who have been harmed.

Web site: www.nfid.org August 2009 Facts About Measles for Adults What is measles? Measles is a highly contagious virus found throughout the world. People get measles disease by breathing in the measles virus which is spread when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. You can get measles just by being in the same room with an infected person. Who should get MMR vaccine? /.notdef.g0001 Adults born in 1957 or later who do not have a medical contraindication should receive at least one dose of the MMR vaccine, unless they have documentation of vaccination with at least one dose of measles-, rubella-, and mumps-containing vaccine or other acceptable evidence of immunity to these three diseases. /.notdef.g0001 College and university students, health care personnel, child care workers such as teachers and day care personnel and international travelers are at increased risk for measles, and should receive two doses of the MMR vaccine to ensure adequate protection. Vaccine Safety The measles vaccine and the combined MMR v accine are very safe and effective and generally have few side effects. Mild reactions such as fever, redness or swelli ng at the injection site have been reported. As with any medicine, there are very small risks that serious problem s could occur after getting the vaccine. However, the potential risks as sociated with measles disease are much greater than the potential risks associated w ith the measles vaccine. MMR vaccine should not be given to persons who are pregnant or severely immunosuppressed. Prevention There is a vaccine to protect against measles. The vaccine is frequently given as part of a combination vaccine, called the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella. There is also a vaccine that protects only against measles. Symptoms Symptoms of measles include high fever, rash, runny nose, watery eyes, coughing, diarrhea, and earache. The average time between exposure to the measles virus and the development of symptoms is usually from 10 to 14 days. 66National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003. Web site: www.nfid.org August 2009 Facts About Measles for Adults FACT: Measles can be prevented with a safe and effective vaccine. FACT: The risk of death from measles is higher for infants and adults than for children. FACT: Of the 140 confirmed cases of measles re ported in 2008, approximately 25% occurred among adults. FACT: Pregnant women who get measles disease ha ve an increased risk for early labor, miscarriage, and low birth weight infants. FACT: Measles is contagious from 4 days before until 4 days after the rash appears. FACT: Measles can cause life-threatening pneum onia and brain infection, severe diarrh ea and sometimes death. FACT: Outbreaks of measles in 2008, primarily affected those who has not been vaccinated with MMR vaccine. FACT: Most cases of measles in the United States now result from infections acquired in other countries or are linked to such imported cases. FACT: Globally, an estimated 10 million cases of measles occur annually, resulting in an estimated 197,000 deaths, nearly all of these am ong children less than five years old. 67National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003.

Prevention There is a vaccine to protect against mumps. The vaccine is given to adults as part of a combination vaccine, called the MMR vaccine, which protects ag ainst measles, mumps and rubella. There is also a vacci ne that protect s only against mumps. Symptoms The symptoms of mumps include a low grade fever and swelling or tenderness of one or more of the salivary glands in the cheeks and under the jaw. In postpubertal males, up to 30% may also experience testicular pain and swelling. Symptoms usually appear between 12 and 25 days after a person has been exposed to the virus. However, as many as 30-40% of the cases may be asymptomatic and nearly 50% are associated with non-specific or primarily respiratory symptoms, with or without parotitis Vaccine Safety The mumps vaccine and the combined MMR vaccine are safe and highly effective in preventing mumps. Occasionally, adults who get the mumps vaccine will develop a low-grade fever or swelling of the salivary glands in the cheeks and neck. Other adverse even ts that are associated with the measles and/or rubella component of MMR, including fever, rash and joint symptoms in adult women, may also infrequently occur. As with any medicine, there are very small risks that serious problems could occur after getting the vaccine. However, the potential risks associated with mumps dis ease are much greater than the potential risks associated with the mumps vaccine. 68National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003.

FACT: Mumps is the most contagious from 3 days before to 5 days after the onset of parotitis. FACT: Approximately two-fifth of infected people do not have symptoms of mumps. FACT: Serious complications of mumps are more common among adults than among children. FACT: About 2-3 out of every 10 adolescent or adult men who have mumps may experience painful swelling of the testicles. Sterility rarely occurs. FACT: Rare complications caused by mumps include infection of the brain (encephalitis) and inflammation of the covering of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). Other rare complications include arthritis, kidney and pancreas problems, deafness, and inflammation of the ovaries. FACT: In 2006, a multistate outbreak of mumps occurred in the United States that affected more than 6,000 people. The majority of the cases occurred among collage age persons, but adolescents and adults were also affected. FACT: In 2008, of the 386 reported cases of mumps, 54% were between 15 and 59 years old. 69 National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003.

Rubella, also called German measles, is caused by a virus that is spread from person to person when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Rubella is also spread by direct contact with the nasal or throat secretions of an infected person. If a pregnant woman gets rubella during pregnancy, pa rticularly during the first 3 months, her baby is at ri sk of having serious birth defects. Who should get MMR vaccine? /.notdef.g0001 Adults born in 1957 or later including non-pregnant women of childbearing age who do not have a medical contraindication shoul d receive at least one dose of the MMR vaccine, unless they have documentation of vaccination with at least one dose of measles-, rubella-, and mumps- containing vaccine or other acceptable evid ence of immunity to these three diseases. /.notdef.g0001 College and university students, health care personnel, child care workers such as teachers and day care personnel, and international travelers are at increased risk for r ubella and these persons should receive two doses of the MMR vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of immunity, regardless of age, in order to ensure adequate protection. Prevention There is a safe and effective vaccine to protect against rubella. The vaccine is usually given to adults as part of a combination vaccine, called the MMR vaccine, that protects against measles, mumps and rubella. There is also a vaccine that protects against rubella only. Symptoms Symptoms of rubella may include a rash, slight fever, aching joints, and reddened eyes. The rash first appears on the face and spreads from head to toe. The lymph nodes just behind the ears and at the back of the neck may swell, causing soreness and pain. Many people with rubella have few or no symptoms, and up to half of the people who have the disease may not get a rash. In most cases of rubella, symptoms appear within 16 to 18 days after exposure. Vaccine Safety The rubella vaccine and the combined MMR vaccine are very safe. The most common side effect is burning or stinging at the injection site. Other common side effects include fever, rash, headache and general weakness. Another adverse event that are associated with the rubella component of MM R vaccine is joint symptoms in adult women. As with any medicine, there are very small risks that serious problems could occur after getting the vaccine. However, the potential risks associated with rubella are much greater than the potential risks associated with the rubella vaccine. 70 National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003.

FACT: Rubella is contagious from 7 days before until 5 to 7 days after the rash appears. FACT: In most cases of rubella, symptoms appear within 12 to 23 days, and 20% to 50% of cases may not exhibit symptoms. FACT: If a pregnant woman gets rubella during the first 3 months of pregnancy, her baby has a good chance of having serious birth defects such as deafness, cataracts, heart defects, liver and spleen damage, and mental retardation FACT: During 2001-2008, 79% of all reported cases of rubella occurred among people 15 years of age and older. FACT: As many as 7 million women of childbearing age are susceptible to rubella. FACT: Up to 7 % of young adults are susceptible to the rubella virus. 71MEASLES, MUMPS & RUBELLA (MMR) VACCINES W H A T Y O U N E E D T O K N O W Many Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages. See www.immunize.org/vis. Why get vaccinated?1 Measles, mumps, and rubella are serious diseases. Measles Measles virus causes rash, cough, runny nose, eye irritation, and fever. It can lead to ear infection, pneumonia, seizures (jerking and staring), brain damage, and death. Mumps Mumps virus causes fever, headache, and swollen glands. It can lead to deafness, meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord covering), painful swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and, rarely, death. Rubella (German Measles) Rubella virus causes rash, mild fever, and arthritis (mostly in women). If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have a miscarriage or her baby could be born with serious birth defects. Y ou or your child could catch these diseases by being around someone who has them. They spread from per-son to person through the air. Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine can prevent these diseases. Most children who get their MMR shots will not get these diseases. Many more children would get them if we stopped vaccinating. Who should get MMR vaccine and when? 2 - Children should get 2 doses of MMR vaccine: The first at 12-15 months of age - and the second at 4-6 years of age . These are the recommended ages. But children can get the second dose at any age, as long as it is at least 28 days after the first dose. Some adults should also get MMR vaccine: Generally, anyone 18 years of age or older who was born after 1956 should get at least one dose of MMR vaccine, unless they can show that they have had either the vaccines or the diseases. Ask your provider for more information. MMR vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Note: A \"combination\" vaccine called MMRV, which contains both MMR and varicella (chickenpox) vaccines, may be given instead of the two individual vaccines to people 12 years of age and younger. 3Some people should not get MMR vaccine or should wait People should not get MMR vaccine who have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or to a previous dose of MMR vaccine. People who are moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting MMR vaccine. Pregnant women should wait to get MMR vaccine until after they have given birth. Women should avoid getting pregnant for 4 weeks after getting MMR vaccine. Some people should check with their doctor about whether they should get MMR vaccine, including anyone who: - Has HIV/AIDS, or another disease that affects the immune system - Is being treated with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids, for 2 weeks or longer. - Has any kind of cancer - Is taking cancer treatment with x-rays or drugs - Has ever had a low platelet count (a blood disorder) People who recently had a transfusion or were given other blood products should ask their doctor when they may get MMR vaccine Ask your provider for more information. 724What are the risks from MMR vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing seri- ous problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of MMR vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Getting MMR vaccine is much safer than getting any of these three diseases. Most people who get MMR vaccine do not have any problems with it. Mild Problems Fever (up to 1 person out of 6) Mild rash (about 1 person out of 20) Swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck (rare) If these problems occur, it is usually within 7-12 days after the shot. They occur less often after the second dose. Moderate Problems Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (about 1 out of 3,000 doses) T emporary pain and stiffness in the joints, mostly in teenage or adult women (up to 1 out of 4) T emporary low platelet count, which can cause a bleeding disorder (about 1 out of 30,000 doses) Severe Problems (Very Rare) Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses) Several other severe problems have been known to occur after a child gets MMR vaccine. But this happens so rarely, experts cannot be sure whether they are caused by the vaccine or not. These include: - Deafness - Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness - Permanent brain damage Note: The first dose of MMRV vaccine has been associated with rash and higher rates of fever than MMR and varicella vaccines given separately. Rash has been reported in about 1 person in 20 and feverin about 1 person in 5. Seizures caused by a fever are also reportedmore often after MMR V . These usually occur 5-12 days after the first dose. 5What if there is a moderate or severe reaction? What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever, weakness, or behavior changes. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. T ell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your provider to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does not provide medical advice.

Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is a very contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It is spread easily through the air by infected people when they sneeze or cough. The disease also spreads through contact with an infected person's chickenpox blisters. Because chickenpox is very contagious, it is possible for people who have neve r had chickenpox nor been vaccinated against it to become infected just by being in a room with someone who has the disease. However, transient exposure is not likely to result in infection. Symptoms of chickenpox Early symptoms may include body aches, fever, fatigue, and irritability. A rash then appears and develops into as many as 250-500 itc hy blisters over the entire body, that usually last for 5-7 days and heal with scabs. The rash may even spread in to the mouth or other internal parts of the body. The illness is usually not severe, but the risk of hospitalization and death is in creased among adolescents and adults. Symptoms appear between 10 and 21 da ys after exposure to the varicella-z oster virus. Persons who were vaccinated against chickenpox may sometimes develop chic kenpox disease but the presentation is usually mild, with approximately 50 or fewer red bumps that ra rely evolve to blisters. What is shingles? Shingles, or herpes zoster, is a common illness that strikes about 1 million Am ericans each year, about half of whom are 60 years of age and older. Shingl es is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. When people are first infected with the varicella-zoster virus, usually as children, they get chickenpox. Years or decades later, the virus can reactivate and cause shingles. Anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk of shingles. Shingles is associated with normal aging and with anything that weakens the immune system such as cer tain medications, cancers, or infections, but it can also occur in healthy children and younger persons. Symptoms of shingles A painful, blistering rash tends to occur on one si de of the body, usually on the trunk or face. There may be pain, numbness or tingling of the area 2 to 4 days before the rash appears. Pain or numbness usually resolves within weeks, but it can sometimes persist fo r much longer. Damage can occur to the eyes or other organs if they are involved. One of the most serious long-term consequences of shingles is post- herpetic neuralgia (PHN), a condition where pain pers ists after the rash has resolved. PHN pain can be very difficult to treat and it can diminish quality of life and functioning to a degree comparable to congestive heart failure, heart attack, type II diabet es and major depression. Prevention Chickenpox can be prevented by vaccination. Child ren who have never had chickenpox should get two doses of chickenpox vaccine, with the 1st dose ad ministered at 12 - 15 months of age and the 2nd at 4-6 years of age. Two doses, administered 4-8 weeks apart, are also recommended for people 13 years of age or older. There is a safe and effective vaccine to pr event shingles. It prevents shingles in 50 percent of those vaccinated and reduces the incidence of PH N by 66 percent. Although people who are vaccinated may still get shingles, they are likely to experience a milder case than un-vaccinated persons.

The chickenpox vaccine is recommended for all susceptible children and adults who do not have contraindications for vaccination. A second dose catch-up varicella vaccination is recommended for children, adolescents, and adults who previously had received only one dose. Persons belonging to the following groups who have not received the vaccine and have not already ha d chickenpox should receive special consideration because they are at a higher risk for exposure/transmission: /.notdef.g0001 Healthcare workers. /.notdef.g0001 College students. /.notdef.g0001 Household contacts of immunocompromised persons. /.notdef.g0001 Residents and staff in institutional settings. /.notdef.g0001 Inmates and staff of correctional institutions /.notdef.g0001 Military personnel. /.notdef.g0001 Nonpregnant women of childbearing age. /.notdef.g0001 Teachers and day care workers. /.notdef.g0001 Non-immune persons who have been exposed to chickenpox should receive varicella vaccine to prevent or diminish the severity of illness. The vaccine is most effective if given within 3 days (72 hours) to 5 days (120 hours) of the exposure. Vaccine is still recommended after 5 days of the exposure to prevent future disease if this current exposure does not result in disease. /.notdef.g0001 . international travelers Who should get shingles vaccine? The shingles vaccine is recommende d for anyone 60 years of age and older to keep the varicella-zoster virus from re-activating and causing shingles. National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 78 Facts About Chickenpox and Shingles for Adults FACT: Chickenpox (varicella) can be prevented with a vaccine. Sometimes vaccinated persons come down with chickenpox after vaccination but the illness is usually mild with < 50 lesions. FACT: Chickenpox is contagious from 1 to 2 days befo re the appearance of rash until all blisters have formed scabs or lesions fade away (if no blisters develop). FACT: Following exposure to an infectious person, it usually takes 10 to 21 days before the symptoms of chickenpox begin to appear. FACT: Adults are more likely than children to die from chickenpox and have serious complications resulting from varicella infection. Currently, le ss than 5% of adults are susceptible to infection with the chickenpox virus; younger adults are more likely to be susceptible. FACT: Immunocompromised people are more likely to have serious illness with complications as a result of chickenpox. The best way to prevent infection in such people is by immunizing their susceptible family members and their other close contacts. However, some immunocompromised people are eligible for vaccination. FACT: If a pregnant woman gets varicella during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, her baby has a 1 in a 100 risk of having serious birth defects such as shor tening and scarring of limbs, cataracts, small head size, abnormal development of the brain and mental retardation FACT: There are about 1 million cases of shingles dia gnosed annually in the U.S. About half of cases are in those 60 years of age and older.

FACT: PHN diminishes quality of life to a degree similar to congestive heart failure, heart attack, type II diabetes and major depression. FACT: Antiviral medications can be used to treat shingles in its acute stage; however, these medications do not have an effect on whether PHN will persist afterward. FACT: Medications used to treat PHN pain are only modestly effective. FACT: There is a vaccine available that reduces the risk of risk of shingles by 50% and the risk of post-herpetic neuralgia by 66%. FACT: The vaccine is recommended for people even if they've had shingles before because shingles can recur. The vacci ne should also be given to people in the recommended age groups even if they cannot recall if they have ever had chickenpox. National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003. Web site: www.nfid.org August 2009 Vaccine Safety Research has shown 1-dose chickenpox vaccine to be 70-90% effective in preventing disease and 95% effective in preventing severe disease. Two doses of vaccine were 99% effective in preventing disease in children in clinical trials. Varicella vaccine is also very safe. The most common side effects are mild and may include pain and redness at the injection site. A mild rash may develop. As with any medicine, there are very small risks that serious problems could occur after getting the vaccine. However, the potential risks associated with varicella disease are much greater than the potential risks associated with the varicella vaccine. Research has shown shingles vaccine to be 51% effective in preventing shingles and 67% effective in preventing the painful condition of post-herpetic neuralgia, one of the most common complications of shingles. No specific safety concerns arose during the shingles vaccine trial. The most common side-effects following the shingles vaccine are redness, pain, tenderness, and swelling at the injection site and headache. 80CHICKENPOX VACCINE W H A T Y O U N E E D T O K N O W Many Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages. See www.immunize.org/vis. 1Why get vaccinated? Chickenpox (also called varicella) is a common childhood disease. It is usually mild, but it can be serious, especially in young infants and adults. It causes a rash, itching, fever, and tiredness. It can lead to severe skin infection, scars, pneumonia, brain damage, or death. The chickenpox virus can be spread from person to person through the air, or by contact with fluid from chickenpox blisters. A person who has had chickenpox can get a painful rash called shingles years later. Before the vaccine, about 11,000 people were hospitalized for chickenpox each year in the United States. Before the vaccine, about 100 people died each year as a result of chickenpox in the United States. Chickenpox vaccine can prevent chickenpox. Most people who get chickenpox vaccine will not get chickenpox. But if someone who has been vaccinated does get chickenpox, it is usually very mild. They will have fewer blisters, are less likely to have a fever, and will recover faster. 2Who should get chickenpox vaccine and when? Routine Children who have never had chickenpox should get 2 doses of chickenpox vaccine at these ages: 1st Dose: 12-15 months of age 2nd Dose: 4-6 years of age (may be given earlier, if at least 3 months after the 1st dose) People 13 years of age and older (who have never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine) should get two doses at least 28 days apart. Catch-Up Anyone who is not fully vaccinated, and never had chickenpox, should receive one or two doses of chickenpox vaccine. The timing of these doses depends on the person's age. Ask your provider. Chickenpox vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Note: A \"combination\" vaccine called MMRV, which contains both chickenpox and MMR vac-cines, may be given instead of the two individual vaccines to people 12 years of age and younger. Some people should not get chickenpox vaccine or should wait 3 People should not get chickenpox vaccine if they have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction to a previous dose of chickenpox vaccine or to gelatin or the antibiotic neomycin. People who are moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting chickenpox vaccine. Pregnant women should wait to get chickenpox vaccine until after they have given birth. Women should not get pregnant for 1 month after getting chickenpox vaccine. Some people should check with their doctor about whether they should get chickenpox vaccine, including anyone who: - Has HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system - Is being treated with drugs that affect the immune system, such as steroids, for 2 weeks or longer - Has any kind of cancer - Is getting cancer treatment with radiation or drugs People who recently had a transfusion or were given other blood products should ask their doctor when they may get chickenpox vaccine. Ask your provider for more information. Chickenpox 3/13/08 814What are the risks from chickenpox vaccine? A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of chickenpox vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Getting chickenpox vaccine is much safer than getting chickenpox disease. Most people who get chickenpox vaccine do not have any problems with it. Reactions are usually more likely after the first dose than after the second. Mild Problems Soreness or swelling where the shot was given (about 1 out of 5 children and up to 1 out of 3 adolescents and adults) Fever (1 person out of 10, or less) Mild rash, up to a month after vaccination (1 person out of 25). It is possible for these people to infect other members of their household, but this is extremely rare. Moderate Problems Seizure (jerking or staring) caused by fever (very rare). Severe Problems Pneumonia (very rare) Other serious problems, including severe brain reac- tions and low blood count, have been reported after chickenpox vaccination. These happen so rarely experts cannot tell whether they are caused by the vaccine or not. If they are, it is extremely rare. Note: The first dose of MMRV vaccine has been associated with rash and higher rates of fever than MMR and varicella vaccines given separately. Rash has been reported in about 1 person in 20 and fever in about 1 person in 5. Seizures caused by a fever are also reported more often after MMR V . These usually occur 5-12 days after the first dose. 5What if there is a moderate or severe reaction? What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever, weakness, or behavior changes. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. T ell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your provider to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does not provide medical advice.

Tetanus, commonly called lockjaw, is caused by a bacterial toxin, or poison, that affects the nervous system. It is contracted through a cut or wound that becomes contaminated with tetanus bacteria. The bacteria can get in through even a tiny pinprick or scratch, but deep puncture wounds or cuts like those made by nails or knives are especially susceptible to infection with tetanus. Tetanus bacteria are present worldwide and are commonly found in soil, dust and manure. Tetanus causes severe muscle spasms, including \"locking\" of the jaw so the patient cannot open his/her mouth or swallow, and may lead to death by suffocation. Tetanus is not transmitted from person to person. Who should get Tdap or Td vaccine? /.notdef.g0001 All adults aged 19-64 years who have not already received Tdap and have not had a Td booster immunization in the last 10 years should receive a single dose of Tdap (rather than Td). Adults > 65 years who have not had a Td booster in the last 10 years should receive Td. /.notdef.g0001 Older adults and diabetics, who are at higher risk for tetanus, should carefully review of their history of tetanus immunization and receive Td or Tdap if they have not had a Td in the last 10 years. /.notdef.g0001 Adults who have never received immunization against tetanus should receive a three dose primary series. /.notdef.g0001 Adults who are health-care workers or who are in contact with infants <1 year of age should also receive Tdap vaccine if they have not had a Td in the past 2 years, in order to protect against pertussis (whooping cough). /.notdef.g0001 All adolescents and adults who deferred their regular booster during 2001-2002 b ecause of shortages of the vaccine - the supply problems have been resolved. /.notdef.g0001 Adolescents aged 11-18 years who have not already received Tdap or Td should receive a single dose of Tdap (rather than Td) to add protection against pertussis (whooping cough). /.notdef.g0001 Any adult or adolescent who has recovered from tetanus (lockjaw) disease should receive Tdap or Td. National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003. Web site: www.nfid.org August 2008Prevention Vaccination is the only way to protect against tetanus. Due to widespread immunization, tetanus is now a rare disease in the U.S. A booster immunization against tetanus is recommended every 10 years. A new combination vaccine, called Tdap, protects against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, and should be used for persons 11-64 years instead of Td (tetanus-diphtheria vaccine). Td should be used for adults 65 years and older. Adolescents and adults who have never received immunization against tetanus should start with a 3-dose primary series given over 7 to 12 months. Symptoms Common first signs of tetanus include muscular stiffness in the jaw (lockjaw) followed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty in swallowing, rigidity of abdominal muscles, generalized spasms, sweating and fever. Symptoms usually begin 7 days after bacteria enter the body through a wound, but this incubation period may range from 3 days to 3 weeks. Vaccine Safety Tetanus vaccine and the combination Td and Tdap vaccines are very safe and effective. Most people have no problems with either. When side effects do occur, they usually include soreness and redness or swelling at the injection site. As with any medicine, there are very small risks that serious problems could occur after getting the vaccine. However, the potential risks associated with tetanus disease are much greater than the potential risks associated with the tetanus vaccine. You cannot get tetanus from the vaccine. 86 Facts About Tetanus for Adults FACT: Tetanus can be prevented with safe and effective vaccines. FACT: You cannot get tetanus from the vaccine. FACT: Tetanus is caused by a toxin produced by a type of bacteria found worldwide in soil, dust and manure. FACT: Tetanus is not transmitted from one person to another; vaccination provides protection of the vaccinated individual only. FACT: Almost all reported cases of tetanus occur in persons who either have never received the primary series of tetanus-preventing immunizations, or those who completed a primary series but have not had a booster vaccination in the past 10 years. FACT: Approximately 10-20% of reported cases of tetanus are fatal. FACT: In the U.S., where 50 or fewer cases of tetanus occur each year, deaths are more likely to occur in persons 60 years of age and older and in persons who are diabetic. FACT: People with tetanus may have to spend several weeks in the hospital under intensive care and frequently require ventilator support. FACT: For adults, a tetanus booster every 10 years ensures protection against tetanus. Tdap booster provides protection against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, and Td provides protection against tetanus and diphtheria. FACT: Recovery from tetanus may not result in immunity. Patients recovering from tetanus should be immunized soon after their condition has stabilized.

Web site: www.nfid.org August 2008 87 Facts About Diphtheria for Adults What is diphtheria? Diphtheria is an acute bacterial disease that usually affects the tonsils, throat, nose and/or skin. It is usually spread from person to person by breathing in droplets that contain diphtheria bacteria. These droplets are produced after an infected person has coughed, sneezed or even laughed. The disease can also be spread by contact with items such as drinking glasses and soiled tissues which are contaminated by discharges from an infected person. Diphtheria bacteria can cause a \"membrane' to form over the throat that can lead to breathing problems. Untreated diphtheria can occasionally result in heart failure, paralysis or death. Although no longer a common disease in the US, diphtheria remains a large problem in other countries and can pose a serious threat to those not fully immunized who travel to other countries or have contact with international travelers coming to the US.

Most people receive their first doses as children in the form of a combined vaccine called DTwP (diphtheria-tetanus-whole-cell pertussis) or DTaP (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis). At age 11 -12, children also receive a booster dose of a combined vaccine called Td (tetanus and diphtheria toxoids )or Tdap (tetanus and diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis for adolescents and adults) For adults, a combination vaccine, called a Td booster, protects against both tetanus and diphtheria. It should be administered once every 10 years from the last dose of a diphtheria-containing vaccine to maintain immunity Adults 19-64 years should receive a single dose of Tdap to replace one Td booster. Symptoms In its early stages, diphtheria may be mistaken for a severe sore throat. Other symptoms include a low grade fever and enlarged lymph nodes (swollen glands) located in the neck. Another presentation of diphtheria can be skin lesions that may be painful, red and swollen. Symptoms usually appear 2 to 4 days after infection, with a range of 1 to 6 days. Untreated diphtheria patients may continue to carry diphtheria bacteria and can be contagious for up to 4 weeks. Some persons may also carry the diphtheria bacteria and spread the disease even though they themselves do not develop symptoms. Vaccine Safety The tetanus and diphtheria (Td) and tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccines are very safe, and very few people experience any side effects. When side effects do occur, they are usually soreness, redness or swelling at the injection site, and a slight fever. As with any medicine, there are very small risks that serious problems could occur after getting the vaccine. The potential risks associated with diphtheria are much greater than the potential risks associated with the diphtheria vaccine. You cannot get diphtheria from the vaccine. 88 Facts About Diphtheria for Adults FACT: Diphtheria can be prevented with safe and effective vaccines. FACT: You cannot get diphtheria from the vaccine. FACT: Diphtheria is transmitted to others through close contact with discharges from an infected person's nose, throat, eyes and/or skin lesions. FACT: Nearly one out of every 10 people who get diphtheria will die from it. FACT: Diphtheria can lead to breathing problems, and sometimes heart failure, paralysis or death if untreated. FACT: Most cases of diphtheria occur among people who are unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated. FACT: Contracting diphtheria is not always followed by lasting immunity, so even those persons who have recently recovered from the disease need to be immunized. FACT: A tetanus-diphtheria (Td) shot every 10 years gives protection against both tetanus and diphtheria. A tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) shot gives protection against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. FACT: Although no longer a common disease in the United States, diphtheria remains a large problem in other countries and can pose a serious threat to United States citizens who may not be fully immunized and who travel to other countries or have contact with immigrants or international travelers coming to the U.S. FACT: An epidemic of diphtheria in Eastern Europe and the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union resulted in over 160, 000 cases and over 4,000 deaths between 1990 and 2001.

Web site: www.nfid.org August 2008 What is pertussis? Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a serious infect ion that spreads eas ily from person to person. The infect ion causes coughing spells so severe that it can be hard to b reathe, eat or sleep. Coughing can even lead to cracked ribs, and is also complicated by pneumonia or hospitalization. Pertussis has been on the rise in the United States since an all-time low of just over 1,000 cases were reported in 1976. While 25,616 cases were reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2005, the vast majority of cases go unreported and some estimates of true incidence range from one to three million cases annually. Symptoms Early symptoms of pertussis are similar to the common cold or bronchitis and may include runny nose, sneezing and low-grade fever. Spasms of coughing then become progressively worse, accompanied by vomiting or incontinence, Sometimes a \"whoop\" sound occurs while gasping for b reath at the end of a coughing spell. Adults rarely have the classic \"whoop\", but the spasms of cough can last for weeks, even months. Prevention Whooping cough is most contagious before the coughing starts, so the most effective way to prevent it is through immunization. The whooping cough booster vaccine for adults (and adolescents) is called Tdap (tetanus-diphtheria- acellular pertussis). Children get a different formulation, called DTaP. Both protect against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. Two Tdap vaccines are currently licensed for use in the U.S. One preparation can be used for both adults and adolescents, and the other has been approved for use only in adolescents: ADACEL (sanofi pasteur) for use in persons 11 to 64 y ears of age Boostrix (GlaxoSmithKline) for use in persons 10 to 18 y ears of age Who should get the Tdap vaccine? The CDC recommends that adults 19 to 64 years of age (and adolescents 11 to 18 years of age) receive a single dose of Tdap in place of the next Td (tetanus-diphtheria) booster recommended for all adults and adolescents. In addition, the CDC has issued recommendations for specific adult populations to have the dose of Tdap before the usual 10 year interval after the last booster dose of Td : Adults who have or who anticipate having close contact with infants younger than 12 months of age. (e.g., parents, grandparents younger than 65 years of age, childcare providers, healthcare workers) Healthcare pers onnel in hospitals or ambulatory care settings who have direct patient contact. Priority is given to vaccination of workers in direct contact w ith infants younger than 12 months of age. Pregnant women after delivery, before discharge from the hospital or birthing center. Vaccine Safety The Tdap vaccine is safe. React ions to the vaccine are usually mild. The most common reactions after vaccination are pain and redness at the injection site. Other adverse events are possible. Please consult with your doctor. A healthcare professional should be informed if you have developed Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome within six weeks following a prior tetanus vaccination, if you are pregnant or nursing, or if you have experienced Arthus-type hypersensitivity react ions (i.e., rare but severe, exaggerated local react ions) following a prior tetanus vaccine. 90Facts About Pertussis for Adults National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003. Web site: www.nfid.org August 2008 FACT: Pertussis is a serious infectious disease that has been on the rise in the United States over the last decade, across all age groups. FACT: Protection against pertussis from early childhood vaccines wears off, leaving adults and adolescents at risk for infection. FACT: The Chinese refer to pertussis as the \"cough of 100 days\" due to the prolonged, dry cough that is experienced by infected individuals. FACT : Pertussis can be difficult to diagnose because early symptoms may appear like the common cold or bronchitis. FACT : Pertussis causes coughing spells that can affect breathing, eating and sleeping. It can even lead to cracked ribs and hospitalization. FACT: Pertussis causes coughing that lasts for weeks, even months. Sometimes a \"whoop\" sound occurs while gasping for breath du ring a bad coughing spell. However, the \"whoop\" is not always present; adults rarely have the classic \"whoop.\" FACT: The vast majority of cases are not reported. While 25,616 cases of pertussis were reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2005, experts estimate that the true number may actually be one to three million cases annually. FACT: Adults and adolescents can spr ead pertussis to infants who have not yet had all of their vaccines, even before a cough develops. Infa nts have the highest rates of pertussis complications and deaths. FACT: Parents, grandparents and older siblings are often the source of pertussis in infants. FACT: A booster vaccine, known as Tdap (tetanus-di phtheria-acellular pertussis), is available to protect against pertussis. One formulation can be used for adults and adolescents. The other has been approved for adolescents only. FACT: The pertussis booster vaccine protects agains t two other important diseases-- tetanus and diphtheria. FACT: The CDC recommends that adults 19 to 64 y ears of age (and adolescents 11 to 18 years of age) receive a single dose of Tdap in place of the Td (tetanus-diphtheria) booster previously recommended for all adults. FACT: The CDC also recommends that adults in close contact with infants younger than 12 months of age, healthcare personnel with direct patient contact \u2014 especially with infants younger than 12 months of age \u2014 and pregnant women directly after delivery receive a single dose of Tdap. 91TETANUS, DIPHTHERIA (Td) orTETANUS, DIPHTHERIA, PERTUSSIS (Tdap) VACCINE W H A T Y O U N E E D T O K N O W Many Vaccine Information Statements are available in Spanish and other languages. See www.immunize.org/vis. Why get vaccinated?1 Children 6 years of age and younger are routinely vaccinated against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis. But older children, adolescents, and adults need protection from these diseases too. Td (T etanus, Diphtheria) and Tdap (T etanus, Diphthe-ria, Pertussis) vaccines provide that protection. TETANUS (Lockjaw) causes painful muscle spasms, usually all over the body. It can lead to tightening of the jaw muscles so the victim cannot open his mouth or swallow. T etanus kills about 1 out of 5 people who are infected. DIPHTHERIA causes a thick covering in the back of the throat. It can lead to breathing problems, paralysis, heart failure, and even death. PERTUSSIS (Whooping Cough) causes severe coughing spells, vomiting, and disturbed sleep. It can lead to weight loss, incontinence, rib fractures and passing out from violent coughing. Up to 2 in 100 adoles- cents and 5 in 100 adults with pertussis are hospitalized or have complications, including pneumonia. These three diseases are all caused by bacteria. Diphtheria and pertussis are spread from person to person. T etanus enters the body through cuts, scratches, or wounds. The United States averaged more than 1,300 cases of tetanus and 175,000 cases of diphtheria each year before vaccines. Since vaccines have been available, tetanus cases have fallen by over 96% and diphtheria cases by over 99.9%. Before 2005, only children younger than than 7 years of age could get pertussis vaccine. In 2004 there were more than 8,000 cases of pertussis in the U.S. among adolescents and more than 7,000 cases among adults. Td and Tdap vaccines2 Td vaccine has been used for many years. It protects against tetanus and diphtheria. Tdap was licensed in 2005. It is the rst vaccine for ado- lescents and adults that protects against all three diseases. Note: At this time, Tdap is licensed for only one lifetime dose per person. Td is given every 10 years, and more often if needed. These vaccines can be used in three ways: 1) as catch-up for people who did not get all their doses of DT aP or DTP when they were children, 2) as a booster dose every 10 years, and 3) for protection against tetanus infection after a wound. Which vaccine, and when?3 Routine: Adolescents 11 through 18 A dose of Tdap is recommended for adolescents who got DT aP or DTP as children and have not yet gotten a booster dose of Td. The preferred age is 11-12. Adolescents who have already gotten a booster dose of Td are encouraged to get a dose of Tdap as well, for protection against pertussis. Waiting at least 5 years between Td and Tdap is encouraged, but not required. Adolescents who did not get all their scheduled doses of DT aP or DTP as children should complete the series using a combination of Td and Tdap. Routine: Adults 19 and Older All adults should get a booster dose of Td every 10 years. Adults under 65 who have never gotten Tdap should substitute it for the next booster dose. Adults under 65 who expect to have close contact with an infant younger than 12 months of age (including women who may become pregnant) should get a dose of Tdap. Waiting at least 2 years since the last dose of Td is suggested, but not required. Healthcare workers under 65 who have direct patient contact in hospitals or clinics should get a dose of Tdap. A 2-year interval since the last Td is suggested, but not required. New mothers who have never gotten Tdap should get a dose as soon as possible after delivery. If vaccination is needed during pregnancy, Td is usually preferred over Tdap. Protection After a Wound A person who gets a severe cut or burn might need a dose of Td or Tdap to prevent tetanus infection. Tdap may be used for people who have never had a dose. But Td should be used if Tdap is not available, or for: - anybody who has already had a dose of Tdap, - children 7 through 9 years of age, or - adults 65 and older. Tdap and Td may be given at the same time as other vaccines. Some people should not be vaccinated or should wait4 Anyone who has had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of DTP, DTaP, DT, or Td should not get Td or Tdap. Anyone who has a severe allergy to any component of a vaccine should not get that vaccine. Tell your provider if the person getting the vaccine has any severe allergies. 92 Anyone who had a coma, or long or multiple seizures within 7 days after a dose of DTP or DT aP should not get Tdap, unless a cause other than the vaccine was found (these people can get Td). T alk to your provider if the person getting either vaccine: - has epilepsy or another nervous system problem, - had severe swelling or severe pain after a previous dose of DTP , DT aP , DT , Td, or Tdap vaccine, or - has had Guillain Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). Anyone who has a moderate or severe illness on the day the shot is scheduled should usually wait until they recover before getting Tdap or Td vaccine. A person with a mild\\ illness or low fever can usually be vaccinated. What are the risks from Tdap and Td vaccines?5 With a vaccine (as with any medicine) there is always a small risk of a life-threatening allergic reaction or other serious problem. Getting tetanus, diphtheria or pertussis would be much more likely to lead to severe problems than getting either vaccine. Problems reported after Td and Tdap vaccines are listed below. Mild Problems (Noticeable, but did not interfere with activities) Tdap Pain (about 3 in 4 adolescents and 2 in 3 adults) Redness or swelling (about 1 in 5) Mild fever of at least 100.4\u00b0F (up to about 1 in 25 adolescents and 1 in 100 adults) Headache (about 4 in 10 adolescents and 3 in 10 adults) Tiredness (about 1 in 3 adolescents and 1 in 4 adults) Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ache (up to 1 in 4 adolescents and 1 in 10 adults) Chills, body aches, sore joints, rash, swollen glands (uncommon) Td Pain (up to about 8 in 10) Redness or swelling (up to about 1 in 3) Mild fever (up to about 1 in 15) Headache or tiredness (uncommon) Moderate Problems (Interfered with activities, but did not require medical attention) Tdap Pain at the injection site (about 1 in 20 adolescents and 1 in 100 adults) Redness or swelling (up to about 1 in 16 adolescents and 1 in 25 adults) Fever over 102\u00b0F (about 1 in 100 adolescents and 1 in 250 adults) Headache (1 in 300) Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ache (up to 3 in 100 adolescents and 1 in 100 adults) Td Fever over 102\u00b0F (rare) Tdap or Td Extensive swelling of the arm where the shot was given (up to about 3 in 100). Severe Problems (Unable to perform usual activities; required medical attention) Tdap T wo adults had nervous system problems after getting the vaccine during clinical trials. These may or may not have been caused by the vaccine. These problems went away on their own and did not cause any permanent harm. Tdap or Td Swelling, severe pain, and redness in the arm where the shot was given (rare). A severe allergic reaction could occur after any vaccine. They are estimated to occur less than once in a million doses. What if there is a severe reaction?6 What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever or behavior changes. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include difculty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. T ell the doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your provider to report the reaction by ling a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can le this report through the VAERS website at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does not provide medical advice.

Meningococcal (muh-nin-jo-cock-al) disease is a very serious bacterial infection that causes severe swelling of the protective lining around the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) or infection of the bloodstream (meningococcal bacteremia). Less often, it causes arthritis or pneumonia. The bacteria that cause meningococcal disease are spread by close, direct contact with a person who is carrying the bacteria in their nose or throat. Even with appropriate treatment, one in ten people who get meningococcal disease will die and two more will have serious permanent disabilities including brain damage, hearing loss and limb amputations. Prevention Meningococcal conjugate vaccine is effective at preventing meningococcal disease caused by four of the five types of bacteria that cause the majority of meningococcal disease worldwide. The vaccine can be given to anyone 2 to 55 years old. Another vaccine (the \"polysaccharide vaccine\") protects against the same four types of meningococcal bacteria and is available for people over 55 years old. Symptoms It its early stages, meningococcal disease symptoms can include fever, headache, body aches and a stiff neck. These symptoms may be mild and can easily be mistaken for less severe illnesses, like a cold or flu. But symptoms can progress quickly, killing an otherwise healthy young person in less than 48 hours. Other symptoms that may occur are nausea, vomiting, confusion, sleepiness, sensitivity to light and a rash (usually dark purple spots on the arms, legs or torso). Who should get meningococcal conjugate vaccine? /.notdef.g0001 Adolescents 11-18 years of age /.notdef.g0001 College freshmen living in dormitories /.notdef.g0001 Other adults at increased risk of meningococcal disease, including : military recruits, international travelers going to certain areas where meningococcal disease is epidemic, microbiologists who may be working with Neisseria meningitidis , and people who have had their spleen removed (or who have non-functioning spleens) as well as other adults with certain medical conditions. National Foundation for Infectious Diseases 4733 Bethesda Avenue, Suite 750, Bethesda, MD 20814 (301) 656-0003. Web site: www.nfid.org August 2008 The conjugate meningococcal vaccine is recommended for all adolescents 11-18 years of age, college freshmen living in dormitories and other persons 19-55 years of age who are at increased risk of meningococcal disease. Vaccine Safety The meningococcal conjugate vaccine is safe. Reactions to the vaccine are usually mild. The most common reactions are pain and redness at the injection site. The vaccine cannot cause meningococcal disease. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, a syndrome of muscle weakness, has been reported rarely among some people who were vaccinated with meningococcal conjugate vaccine. People for whom meningococcal vaccination is recommended but who have a history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome should talk to their doctors - the menin gococcal polysaccharide vaccine ma y be a good alternative for them.. 97Facts About Meningococcal Disease for Adults FACT: Meningococcal conjugate vaccine is a safe and effective vaccine licensed to prevent meningococcal disease in persons 2-55 years old. FACT: The vaccine protects against four of the five main types of meningococcal bacteria that cause meni ngococcal disease. These four types cause 75% of cases in adults and adolescents. FACT: You cannot get meningococcal disease from the vaccine. FACT: The vaccine is safe and side effects after vaccination are usually minor and can include pain and redness at the injection site. There have been rare reports of severe muscle weakness occurring in association with getting this vaccine. FACT: Up to 2,800 Americans get meningoc occal disease every year; one in every ten will die, even with treatment. FACT: Two in ten of those who survive will have serious permanent disabilities like brain damage, hearing loss and limb amputations. FACT: College-bound students, particularly those who will live in dormitories, are at higher risk for this disease. FACT: The bacteria are spread through cl ose, direct contact with a person carrying the bacteria. FACT: The bacteria are not spread by casual contact such as breathing air where an infected person has been. FACT: Early symptoms of meningococcal disease (fever, headache, body aches and stiff neck) may be mistaken for other less serious illnesses like the common cold or flu, but meningococcal disease symptoms can progress quickly killing an otherwise healthy young person in two days or less. FACT: The meningococcal conjugate vaccine is recommended for all college freshmen living in dormitories (if they have not already received it). It is recommended for other adults who are at increased risk of meningococcal disease, including military recruits, persons traveling to areas where there is more meningococcal disease, or persons with certain medical conditions.

See www.immunize.org/vis. What is meningococcal disease?1 Meningococcal disease is a serious bacterial illness. It is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children 2 through 18 years old in the United States. Meningitis is an infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Meningococcal disease also causes blood infections. About 1,000 - 2,600 people get meningococcal disease each year in the U.S. Even when they are treated with antibiotics, 10-15% of these people die. Of those who survive, another 11-19% lose their arms or legs, become deaf, have problems with their nervous systems, become mentally retarded, or suffer seizures or strokes. Anyone can get meningococcal disease. But it is most common in infants less than one year of age and people with certain medical conditions, such as lack of a spleen. College freshmen who live in dormitories, and teenagers 15-19 have an increased risk of getting meningococcal disease. Meningococcal infections can be treated with drugs such as penicillin. Still, about 1 out of every ten people who get the disease dies from it, and many others are affected for life. This is why preventing the disease through use of meningococcal vaccine is important for people at highest risk. 2Meningococcal vaccine There are two kinds of meningococcal vaccine in the U.S.: - Meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) was licensed in 2005. It is the preferred vaccine for people 2 through 55 years of age. - Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) has been available since the 1970s. It may be used if MCV4 is not available, and is the only meningococcal vaccine licensed for people older than 55. Both vaccines can prevent 4 types of meningococcal disease, including 2 of the 3 types most common in the United States and a type that causes epidemics in Africa. Meningococcal vaccines cannot prevent all types of the disease. But they do protect many people who might become sick if they didn't get the vaccine. Both vaccines work well, and protect about 90% of people who get them. MCV4 is expected to give betterlonger-lasting protection. MCV4 should also be better at preventing the disease from spreading from person to person. , Who should get meningococcal vaccine and when? 3 A dose of MCV4 is recommended for children and adolescents 11 through 18 years of age. This dose is normally given during the routine pre- adolescent immunization visit (at 11-12 years). But those who did not get the vaccine during this visit should get it at the earliest opportunity Meningococcal vaccine is also recommended for other people at increased risk for meningococcal disease: . College freshmen living in dormitories. Microbiologists who are routinely exposed to meningococcal bacteria. U.S. military recruits. Anyone traveling to, or living in, a part of the world where meningococcal disease is common, such as parts of Africa. Anyone who has a damaged spleen, or whose spleen has been removed. Anyone who has terminal complement component deficiency (an immune system disorder). People who might have been exposed to meningitis during an outbreak. MCV4 is the preferred vaccine for people 2 through 55 years of age in these risk groups. MPSV4 can be used if MCV4 is not available and for adults over 55. How Many Doses? People 2 years of age and older should get 1 dose. Sometimes a second dose is recommended for people who remain at high risk. Ask your provider. MPSV4 may be recommended for children 3 months to 2 years of age under special circumstances. These children should get 2 doses, 3 months apart. 994Some people should not get meningococcal vaccine orshould wait Anyone who has ever had a severe (life-threatening) allergic reaction to a previous dose of either meningococcal vaccine should not get another dose. Anyone who has a severe (life threatening) allergy to any vaccine component should not get the vaccine. T ell your provider if you have any severe allergies. Anyone who is moderately or severely ill at the time the shot is scheduled should probably wait until they recover. Ask your provider. People with a mild illness can usually get the vaccine. Anyone who has ever had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome should talk with their provider before getting MCV4. Meningococcal vaccines may be given to pregnant women. However, MCV4 is a new vaccine and has not been studied in pregnant women as much as MPSV4 has. It should be used only if clearly needed. Meningococcal vaccines may be given at the same time as other vaccines. 5 What are the risks from meningococcal vaccines? A vaccine, like any medicine, could possibly cause serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of meningococcal vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Mild problems As many as half the people who get meningococcal vaccines have mild side effects, such as redness or pain where the shot was given. If these problems occur, they usually last for 1 or 2 days. They are more common after MCV4 than after MPSV4. A small percentage of people who receive the vaccine develop a fever. Severe problems Serious allergic reactions, within a few minutes to a few hours of the shot, are very rare. A serious nervous system disorder called Guillain- Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (or GBS) has been reported among some people who received MCV4. This happens so rarely that it is currently not possible to tell if the vaccine might be a factor. Even if it is, the risk is very small. What if there is a moderate or severe reaction? 6 What should I look for? Any unusual condition, such as a high fever, weakness, or behavior changes. Signs of a serious allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, hoarseness or wheezing, hives, paleness, weakness, a fast heart beat or dizziness. What should I do? Call a doctor, or get the person to a doctor right away. T ell your doctor what happened, the date and time it happened, and when the vaccination was given. Ask your doctor, nurse, or health department to report the reaction by filing a Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) form. Or you can file this report through the VAERS web site at www.vaers.hhs.gov, or by calling 1-800-822-7967. VAERS does not provide medical advice.

Policy: Under these standing orders, eligible nurses and other healthcare professionals (e.g., pharmacists), where allowed by state law, may vaccinate adults who meet any of the criteria below. Procedure 1. Identify adults in need of vaccination against meningococcal disease based on any of the following criteria: a. anticipated college enrollment, particularly anticipated residence in an on-campus dormitory b. anticipated travel to a country in the \"meningitis belt\" of sub-Saharan Africa or other location of epidemic meningococcal disease, particularly if contact with the local population will be prolonged c. anticipated travel to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, for the annual Hajj d. diagnosis of a damaged spleen; splenectomy e. diagnosis of persistent complement component deciency (an immune system disorder) f. employment as a microbiologist with routine exposure to isolates of N. meningitidis g. military recruits h. any other adult wishing to decrease their risk for meningococcal disease i. history of receiving either meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) or meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4) at least 5 years earlier and with continued risk for infection (e.g., living in or recurrent travel to epidemic disease areas). Persons whose only risk factor is living in on-campus housing are not recommended to receive an additional dose if the previous dose was MCV4. 2. Screen all patients for contraindications and precautions to meningococcal vaccine: a. Contraindications: a history of a serious reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) after a previous dose of meningococcal vaccine or to a meningococcal vaccine component. For a list of vaccine components, go to www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/ appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf. b. Precautions: moderate or severe acute illness with or without fever; history of Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome (if not at extremely high risk of meningococcal disease) 3. Provide all patients with a copy of the most current federal Vaccine Information Statement (VIS). You must document in the patient's medical record or ofce log, the publication date of the VIS and the date it was given to the patient. Provide non-English speaking patients with a copy of the VIS in their native language, if available and preferred; these can be found at www.immunize.org/vis. 4. For adults ages 55 years and younger, administer 0.5 mL MCV4 via the intramuscular route (22-25g, 1-1\u00bd\u0005 needle) in the deltoid muscle. (Note: a H\u0005 needle may be used for patients weighing less than 130 lbs [<60kg] for injection in the deltoid muscle only if the skin is stretched tight, subcutaneous tissue is not bunched, and the injection is made at a 90-degree angle.) If the person has a permanent contraindication or precaution to MCV4 or if MCV4 is unavailable and immediate protection is needed, MPSV4 is an acceptable alternative, although it must be given subcutaneously. For adults older than age 55 years, administer 0.5 mL MPSV4 via the subcutaneous route (23-25g, H\" needle) in the posterolateral fat of the upper arm. Adults who remain at high risk should receive subsequent vaccination 5 years after the previous dose. 5. Document each patient's vaccine administration information and follow up in the following places: a. Medical chart: Record the date the vaccine was administered, the manufacturer and lot number, the vaccination site and route, and the name and title of the person administering the vaccine. If vaccine was not given, record the reason(s) for non-receipt of the vaccine (e.g., medical contraindication, patient refusal). b. Personal immunization record card: Record the date of vaccination and the name/location of the administering clinic. 6. Be prepared for management of a medical emergency related to the administration of vaccine by having a written emergency medi- cal protocol available, as well as equipment and medications. 7. Report all adverse reactions to meningococcal vaccine to the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) at www. vaers.hhs.gov or (800) 822-7967.
