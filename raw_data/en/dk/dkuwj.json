It's my exclusive system of healing that I formulated after years of working with various manual therapy and body therapy modalities. KRT is a combination of various potent healing systems and its purpose is to heal physical and psychosomatic pain and restore emotional balance. We first work to re-balance your kinetic chain by gently releasing tension in soft tissue structures, re-aligning the joints, and working with your body to break its holding and pain patterns. We then work to release any toxic emotional energies that are stored within the body. This is done by gently bringing you into the a deep state of relaxation as we access all dimensions of your being to clear out and recalibrate all these dimensions into a coherent vibrational resonance. In other words, I work with you to help restore the harmony within your body, mind, and spirit. KRT is influenced by a variety of modalities including: - Ortho-Bionomy\u00ae - Barnes Myofascial Release (MFR) - Acro-Therapeutics - Energy work of Wilhelm Reich and Orgonomy. We usually begin by scanning your entire body for soft tissue restrictions and then specifically utilizing Ortho-Bionomy as a powerful and sophisticated tool to unlock contractions (tensions, adhesion, knots and kinks) in muscles and re-align and mobilize joints, as we use Barnes MFR to gently stimulate your body to unwind restrictions/stickiness in your fascia (connective tissue). While Ortho-Bionomy treats the structure (bones, joints, muscles, fascia, tendons, ligaments, etc.), fluids (blood, lymph, CSF), viscera (organs), and bioenergetic field, Barnes MFR treats the fascial (connective tissue) system primarily which affects the subconscious mind, bioenergetic field, our muscles, and even our trauma patterns. In addition to the potent healing methods used, I may also use various joint mobilization and spinal decompression techniques such as Acro-Therapeutics which is the therapeutic flying technique which is part of AcroYoga - Think upgraded Thai Yoga Massage. I have found that this unique combination of methods results in longer lasting benefits in a shorter amount of time making it both more effective AND efficient than most other more popular forms of manual therapies. In my experience, KRT has proven to bring the physical body back into balance quickly and easily, frequently providing a high degree of relief and even instant resolution in most cases from the pain and discomfort caused by common musculoskeletal dysfunctions. While results may vary, most people who receive KRT sessions appreciate how their body is gently positioned in ways that make it feel safe enough to let go of tension and emotional energy on its own. By slowing down and tuning into your body, we tap into the innate intelligence of it to organically heal itself without the use of aggressive force. While various other therapies primarily treat the symptoms of pain and discomfort in the body, KRT sessions follow the principles of Ortho-Bionomy and osteopathy by treating the CAUSE of the issue or imbalance and NOT JUST THE SYMPTOMS. Your First Few Visits We work together as a team to identify areas of discomfort, tension and pain as well as areas of comfort and ease of movement. Gentle movements, specific positioning, sustained yet gentle compression and subtle contacts are used. Every session is specifically designed around your body's individual needs on that particular day. We then discuss what it would look like if we were to continue working together. "}
