He presented data on graduation rates across departments , namely: chemistry and biochemistry, mathematics and statis tical sciences, philosophy, physics, and psychology. He explained that the School has over 6,000 students , over 300 faculty members and has awarded over 1,500 degrees. Associate Dean Van Hamme indicated that the Translational Molecular Discoveries Progra m, which is an FIU Emerging Preeminent Program , integrate s the basic and applied research efforts of faculty members across disciplines for the benefit of human health and wellness. In terms of the Center for Imaging Science , he mentioned that the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD study) is funded by the National Institutes of Health and is the largest long-term s tudy of brain development and child health in the United States. For the next Health Affairs Committee meeting, Committee Chair Ar mas requested further information relating to the low graduation rates, namely the underlying causes and strategies for improvement . Associate Dean Van Hamme introduced Distinguished Unive rsity Professor Dr. William E. Pelham who serves as the Director of the FIU Center for Children and Families (CCF) . Professor Pelham presented a brief video highlighting the CCF . Professor Pelham indicated that the CCF is the leading center in Florida conducting r esearch in child mental health and one of the top programs in the country. He explained that the CCF is home to 34 of the nation's best researchers and that the work of CCF faculty was featured in 80+ articles in the national media, in cluding top-tier outlets such as The Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, and Reuters. He reported that every year the CCF trains over 100 FIU graduate students , adding that in FY 2017, 450 FIU undergraduate students were involved in one of the centers' faculty labs, and an additional 100+ from colleges around the U.S. worked as interns during the Summer Treatment Pr ograms. He explained that the CCF hosted nine speaker series events featuring national expert s in child mental health during FY 2018 , adding that the events were attended by close to 400 participants. In response to Committee Chair Armas' inquiry, Professor Pelham explained that the CCF is accessible to all members of the community and that those interested in contacting the CCF could do so by either visiting the CCF's webpage or by calling the number that is listed online.

Below is a summary of the topics addressed in this report: Health services available to students at FIU inclusive of fee coverage and pricing FIU students eligible for the aforementioned health services FIU health fee compared across the State University System (SUS) FIU services compared to services offered by other SUS institutions Allocation of the student health fee by division and service areas for 2016-2017 through 2018-2019 Access to and utilization of student health services for 2016-2017 through 2018-2019 Marketing plan update for the promotion of student health resources, survey results from the Fall 2018 student survey, and proposal for this upcoming academic year Page 6 of 161 3 BACKGROUND General The Student Health Fee ($93.69 per semester) is a mandatory fee that is charged to all degree-seeking students, with some exceptions: those enrolled in high school dual enrollment, employees using tuition waivers, and students enrolled in programs outside of the U.S. such as Tianjin, Jamaica, etc. ( More information about how this fee is allocated is detailed later in this report. ) The majority of student health services are provided within the Student Health Center (SHC) located at the Modesto A. Maidique Campus (MMC) and the Student Health Services building at the Biscayne Bay Campus (BBC). Due to space limitations, some services are provided at other locations on campus: Disability Resource Center (DRC) is located within the Graham Center (GC) at MMC and within the Wolfe University Center (WUC) at BBC On demand services for Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), Health Promotion Services (HPS) and Victims Empowerment Program (VEP) are provided at BBC in different locations depending on service/event Athletic training services are offered on the first floor of the Recreation and Wellness Center (WRC) at MMC Health Compliance is located within the Student Academic Success Center (SASC) at MMC Historically, all student health services were managed by the Division of Student Affairs. With the creation of the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine and the FIU Health Care Network, the FIU Board of Trustees felt there was a need to better integrate clinical services. Management of Services On July 1, 2015 the FIU Academic Health Center Health Care Network Faculty Group Practice, Inc. (HCN) and the then FIU Division of Student Affairs (DSA) entered into a 1-year agreement for the management and related support services of Student Health Services (SHS). This agreement, presented to the Board in June 2015, is governed by a Joint Governance Committee (JGC) for Student Health. With this agreement, the clinical services of SHS moved under the management of the HCN (e.g., general care, behavioral health and psychiatry, women's health services, dermatology, laboratory services, immunizations/vaccinations, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, pharmacy operations). The personnel under the management of the HCN include the HCN management team; student health clinics administration directors; operational support staff; providers of direct clinical care services including primary care, gynecology, behavioral health Page 7 of 161 4 and psychiatry, and dermatology; clinical support staff such as nurses and certified medical assistants; and pharmacists. Since 2015, the HCN has focused on the realignment of operations, renovating the center to meet current needs, expanding services and identifying efficiencies and maximizing capacity of the service providers. All other student health services (e.g., counseling, victim services, health promotion outreach, wellness initiatives) remained under the then Division of Student Affairs - now, the Division of Academic and Student Affairs (ASA). The original agreement was renegotiated and renewed in 2016 for a 3-year term, which expired on June 30, 2019. The renewal agreement had a 1-year auto-renewal, which was activated given the lack of a negotiation between both entities (due solely to timing since the original plan was to present to BOT-HAC in Spring 2018). The Joint Governance Committee hopes to sign a new MOU prior to the 2020 deadline. Institutional Re-Organization In July 2018, Academic Affairs and Student Affairs were merged under one division with a Senior Vice President oversees both areas. In July 2019, a new Associate Vice President of Student Health and Wellness was appointed, reporting to the SVP of Academic & Student Affairs. She oversees three health-fee funded areas (health promotion services, counseling & psychological services, and victim empowerment program) and two E&G/ A&S -fee funded areas (dean of students, and student conduct & academic integrity). In August 2019, a new Vice Provost of Population Health and Well-being was appointed, reporting to the Provost. She also serves as the Associate Dean for Clinical and Community Affairs within the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine. Student clinics and Pharmacy remain reporting to the FIU Health Care Network. Page 8 of 161 5 Blue = Health Fee funded areas Yellow = A&S Fee / E&G funded areas Green = Health Fee funded areas that report to other units * Pharmacy is only funded by the health fee at 50% Board of Governors Since 2015, the Florida Board of Governors (BOG) has supported two system-wide initiatives: campus safety & security and mental health counseling services. The latter Legislative Budget Request ( LBR ) was designed to seek additional funding from the State L egislature to \" raise the staffing levels of the SUS Counseling Centers to the minimum staffing ratios that are recommended by the profession's accreditation association, the International Association of Counseling Services (IACS). IACS standards state that minimum staffing ratios should strive to be \"in the range of one FTE professional staff member to every 1,000 to 1,500 students, depending on services offered and other campus mental health agencies.'\" Although this LBR was supported and lobbied by the BOG in 2015 (for 2016-2017) and 2016 (for 2017-2018), no additional state funding was provided to the SUS institutions. Understanding the national trends and challenges faced by college students, the BOG formed the Drugs, Alcohol and Mental Health Task Force in March 2018. Given the emphasis by most of the SUS institutions on improving mental health services, the Task Force urged the institutions to seek internal funding in order to address the gaps at their respective campuses. STUDENT HEALTH FEE Student Health & Wellness Counseling & Psychological Services Victim Empowerment Program Health Promotion Services Health Compliance Healthy Living Dean of Students Student Conduct & Academic Integrity Student Health Clinics Pharmacy* Disability Resource Center Athletic Training Services Page 9 of 161 6 During this time, FIU's ratio was over the desired ratio. FIU committed to raising the staffing levels of our counseling centers in order to meet the staffing ratios recommended by IACS. Seven (7) new counseling positions were approved along with related expenses (e.g., hiring expenses, overhead, technology), open positions were actively recruited for placement, and equity adjustments for current clinical staff were also incorporated into the funding plan. CAPS began the hiring process in early 2018. Since that time, CAPS has successfully recruited and on-boarded seven highly qualified clinicians. After the final 4 counselors are hired (currently being recruited), FIU will be within the recommended range. CAPS' ongoing outreach to students to reduce stigma related to mental health services and remove obstacles and barriers to accessing services has been very successful, resulting in a 29.5% increase in utilization over the past three years by students seeking professional help for everything from academic stress to serious and persistent mental illness that was impacting their ability to graduate. During the same period, more students have presented with more severe problems, requiring crisis intervention and urgent assessment on a more regular basis. Consequently, CAPS has shifted more resources to same-day consultations/crisis walk-ins to meet that need. Additionally, CAPS has expanded the group therapy and group psychoeducation programs to meet the increased demand by the student population for mental health services. There has also been increased referrals from CAPS to HCN for clinical psychiatry services. CAPS has been providing telehealth services on a limited basis since August of 2014. Since that time, there has been a continual expansion of these virtual services to fully online students, including virtual individual therapy (i.e., meeting with a clinician via secure video conferencing), additional marketing of services to online students, extended evening hours, and expanded therapist-guided and self-help online tools. In Fall 2019, CAPS launched tele- counseling services via WellConnect, which includes telephone, videoconference, and text/chat therapy. This program is currently targeted to our online students as well as students studying outside of Miami (e.g., study abroad, FIUinDC). Continued extension of evening hours and weekend hours for online students began in August 2019. These changes have increased access for those students who are unable to come to a CAPS location because of geographical or time constraints. CAPS has also made changes to internal processes and procedures to facilitate these initiatives, including improvements in student registration for services and training and certification for the staff in the delivery of online clinical services. Page 10 of 161 7 NATIONAL TRENDS National trends are evaluated annually to ensure that we are offering our students the services they need. The American College Health Association's National College Health Assessment (ACHA-NCHA II) offers great highlights on students across the U.S. The ACHA-NCHA now provides the largest known comprehensive data set on the health of college students. The last data sets shared with BOT-HAC were from the Spring 2016 report. The Fall 2018 survey (the most current report) consisted of 26,181 respondents across the country. Many of the statistics in this report are in line with trends at FIU and across the State University System (SUS) and have remained consistent since the last report. (NOTE: The summary below contains highlights only. Please click on link above to access the complete report.) General Health of College Students When college students were surveyed, 49.0% described their health as very good or excellent. However, this percentage increased to 82.0% when describing their health as good, very good, or excellent. 54.6% of college students reported being diagnosed or treated by a professional with one or more of the following conditions within the last 12 months.

The Student Health Fee ($93.69 per semester) is a mandatory fee that is charged to all degree-seeking students, with some exceptions: those enrolled in high school dual enrollment; employees using tuition waivers; and students enrolled in programs outside of the U.S. such as Tianjin, Jamaica, etc. Students that are not automatically assessed the health fee can still pay the fee at time of service and be eligible for services for the rest of that semester. What is the Health Fee Used For? The health fee allows the University to provide high quality, affordable clinical care, preventative care and mental health services at convenient on- campus locations, and online, by various departments. These departments include: Athletic Training Services (ATS) Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) Disability Resource Center (DRC) Health Promotion Services/ Healthy Living (HPS) Student Health Clinics (SHC) Victim Empowerment Program (VEP) What Services Does the Health Fee Include? Services funded through the health fee include access to: Primary health care Health education Limited specialty care Class presentations Health events/fairs Services for students with disabilities Counseling for issues such as anxiety or depression, and Support services for victims of emotional or physical abuse. Some additional clinical services are also offered but provided to the students for an added nominal cost ( refer to Fee Schedule ). Fee Schedule The following brochure is distributed at the centers as well as throughout the campuses. It lists the locations, contact information, services, and procedures that are covered by the health fee or offered at a reduced cost. (Services with supplemental fees are billed to the student or their University-sponsored insurance plan.) Page 15 of 161 12 Page 16 of 161 13 Page 17 of 161 14 Page 18 of 161 15 Page 19 of 161 16 Students Eligible for Services All students who pay the Health Fee (i.e., degree-seeking students) are eligible to receive student health services. The students that are not eligible to receive health services (i.e., those who do not pay the health fee) are those who are: high school dual enrolled employees using tuition waivers students enrolled in programs outside of the U.S. such as Tianjin, Jamaica, etc. Given the demographics of these populations, these students are not charged the fee as they are the population least likely to visit any of the two campuses that have student health facilities. Students that are not automatically assessed the health fee can still pay the fee at time of service and be eligible for the services for the rest of that semester. However, health education and victim empowerment services are available to all enrolled students regardless of the fee being assessed. The following table and graph illustrate the number of enrolled students since the 2016-17 AY who have been billed the health fee versus the University's total enrollment. Since the health fee is collected by headcount on a semester basis, it was necessary to weigh the semesters (0.375 for Fall; 0.375 for Spring; 0.25 for Summer) to reflect annual numbers. YEAR PAID HEALTH FEE 2016-17 weighted average 41,814 (or 84% of total student enrollment) 2016 45,951 2017 Summer 2017 32,296 2017-18 weighted total student enrollment) Fall 2017 46,417 Spring 2018 44,174 Summer 2018 37,368 2018-2019 weighted average 47,272* (or 90% of total student population) Fall 2018 51,299 Spring 2019 48,991 Summer 2019 38,474 YTD Fall 2019 51,403 (or 88% of total student population) * The notable increase in enrollment in Fall 2018 is the result of the inclusion of fu lly online students to the population of students assessed the fee. Page 20 of 161 17 Note: The increase of billed health fee in FY 2018-2019 is the result of the inclusion of fully online stu dents to the population of students assessed the fee.49,69251,59952,60458,576 41,81443,31447,22751,403 010,00020,00030,00040,00050,00060,00070,000 2016-2017 2017-2018 2018-2019 YTD Fall 2019Student Enrolled vs Billed Health Fee Weighted Average Student Enrollment Weighted Average Students Billed Health Fee Page 21 of 161 18 COMPARATIVE DATA WITHIN STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM (SUS) Health Fee Charged Across SUS For the 2019-2020 academic year, FIU ranks 9th among the 12 SUS institutions in terms of the costs charged to students for health services. (Refer to the next page for the comparative bar graph. ) FIU is the only university that bases its fees by student headcount, whereas the other 11 institutions base their fees by credit hours. Since FIU has a large commuter population and its students take an average of fewer than 12 credit hours per semester, the total revenues received using a headcount methodology is in line with the effort needed to service the total number of students enrolled. Therefore, the graph is normalized based on the cost for a student taking 12 credits per semester. Given our enrollment size, it is important to understand why the health fee is below the SUS average. To keep the cost of attendance as low as possible, FIU alternates fee increases among the three student fees (i.e., Activity and Service Fee, Health Fee, and Athletics Fee) in a rotating, three-year cycle. This means that the Health Fee would only be eligible for an increase every three years. FIU has not raised the Health Fee since fiscal year 2013-2014 (from $83.19 to $93.69 per semester). Though the fee was eligible for an increase in 2016-2017, SUS institutions have been discouraged from increasing tuition or fees since average cost is now a performance funding metric. Additional points to consider: Per Florida statute 1009.24 , the combination of the fees is subject to a cap of 40% of tuition and increases are limited to 5% of the sum of the triad fees. University of Florida, for example, has the highest health fee because it increased its health fee by the 5% cap for eight of the last ten years (fee was maintained in FY 2010-2011 and 2016-2017). Other institutions have not always gone to the allowed maximum 5% and in some cases have not increased fees for several years. Also in 2010-2011, the legislature allowed universities to exceed the 5% cap. Of the four universities with the highest health fee, UF had the highest increase at 25% in that year. Page 22 of 161 19 When understanding access and resources among the various institutions, it is also important to note that, of the 12 universities, three require students to provide proof of health insurance coverage: UF, FSU and FAMU (the three land-grant institutions for the state). Those students who do not have health insurance are required to purchase one of the university-sponsored student health insurance plans. At FIU, health insurance is only mandated for international students, the majority of our medical and nursing students, and graduate assistants with full-term appointments. The Florida Board of Governors is currently considering a mandatory hard waiver insurance plan for the SUS. We suspect the topic will be discussed this upcoming academic year. Page 23 of 161 20 *FIU Student Health Fee is based on headcount, all others are based on student credit hours [Data Source -- Florida Board of Governors, Tuition and 12-credits per semester*) SUS AVERAGE $118.58 Page 24 of 161 21 Health Services Offered Across SUS The following chart was created to illustrate a more comprehensive school- by-school and service- by-service comparison. When reviewing the information, it is important to keep the following in mind: The analysis was based on each institution's stu dent health websites and follow-up inquiries by FIU personnel. Some institutions have different names for similar services, offer multiple services under a generic service name, and/or offer highly specialized services that may be unique to their student population. Given this, there may be overlap or gaps in the chart. The following chart only shows services offered to students at each institution by their respective health centers; it does not differentiate which service is fully covered or discounted. Page 25 of 161 22 This chart reflects health services offered to students who pay the university health fee. However, services listed below do not differentiate between those covered by the respective fee and those that may be provided at an additional charge to the student.

The fee, broken out into six major service units (listed below in alphabetical order), provides services to inform, prevent and/or address problems or issues that affect students' ability to excel academically. All of these service areas are allocated their respective budgets, which are distributed between HCN and ASA. Athletic Training Services (ATS) Medical coverage during all intramural competitions First aid Evaluation & therapy of orthopedic injuries Physical therapy & athletic rehabilitation Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) Individual, couples and group therapy with students by licensed psychologists, licensed mental health counselors, and licensed clinical social workers Body acceptance program, in partnership with SHC, for students with body image concerns Consultations and recommendations for students who have been referred to CAPS Telehealth and Therapist Assisted Online (TAO) treatment APA- and APPIC-approved Doctoral and Post-Doctoral Training Programs Testing for psychoeducational, neuropsychological, ADHD and personality evaluations for students referred for academic difficulties Outreach events and psychoeducational workshops Psychiatric services in conjunction with psychotherapy services Disability Resource Center (DRC) Students registered with the DRC can request academic accommodations, including: o Note taker o Extended time for exams o American Sign Language interpreter o Use of assisted technology o Braille test conversion o Electronic textbook access o Captioning services o Qualified readers Access Consultants meet with students to discuss services, benefits of accommodations, available resources and academic guidance Students registered with DRC also gain access to the Adaptive Technology Lab to support academic coursework Page 31 of 161 28 Health Promotion Services / Healthy Living (HPS) Oversees the compliance of immunization and international insurance holds that are mandatory for student matriculation Complementary medicine services, including aromatherapy and massage therapy Dietitian/Nutrition counseling services Free access to safer sex materials, including condoms HIV/Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) counseling and testing Health education and presentations for university departments and student clubs about sexual health, substance use, balanced lifestyles and stress management Healthy Living consultations to address sexual health, nutrition education, tobacco dependence, asthma management, stress management, sleep, and substance use and abuse Management and development of online health education content including Student Health 101 blog (a monthly virtual magazine sent to all FIU students), HPS virtual newsletter, and the Healthy Minute podcast Student Health Clinics (SHC) Athletic physicals Doctors' visits to diagnose illness or injury On-campus pharmacy with discounted pricing Women's health, including gynecology, pregnancy and STI testing and insertion of long-acting contraception Specialized services including psychiatry, behavioral health and dermatology Vaccines Victim Empowerment Program (VEP) 24-hour support from victim advocates Crisis counseling for individuals who have been victimized Accompaniment to court, meetings, hearings and other events involving the criminal justice system or the FIU Student Conduct process Interaction with instructors, legal representatives, family members, or other service providers upon request Educational programming, social work internships, and training for students in the peer educator program The graphs and charts that follow will illustrate a three-year comparison of: Actual revenues and expenditures from fiscal year 2016-17 through 2018- 2019, Fiscal year 2018-2019 budget to actual results, How the fiscal year 2019-2020 health fee budget has been allocated by service area, positions and natural expense classification.

The Building and IT managers and other shared services are also split between both units.

In FY 2017-2018 revenues increased more significantly due to the health fee being charged to students in fully-online programs. (2) Overall operating expenses increased from FY 2016-2017 to FY 2018-2019 due to additional hires in CAPS, increased expenses related to the new staff, as well as across-the-board increases in certain years. These expenses were partially offset by a decreased need in OPS hires. (3) Net transfers were primarily attributed to the construction projects associated with the Student Health facilities at both MMC and BBC. (4) The ending net asset balance pertaining to Student Health Services are a result of: excess revenues over expenses throughout the years that are placed as reserves for future commitments, such as deferred maintenance and long-term capital expenditures; reserves f or continuance of operations in the event of an emergency and non-recurring expenses in any given year; and, future building expansion plans to address increased space demands for new staff as well as expansion of services (i.e., continuum of care model).

(2) Hiring delays for the additional CAPS hires reflects the bulk of the savings within Salaries & Benefits. Staff turnover and position vacancies (inclusive of related operating expenses) across all units account for the remaining savings. (3) Net Transfers represent funds transferred to and from Student Affairs and Student Health Clinics, as well as transfers to Facilities for various projects: maintenance, l ife safety, improvements to CAPS waiting area. The savings from the clinics related to salaries and benefits yielded savings to net health fees transfers. (4) The favorable change in net assets was a result of savings in operating expenses and, to a smaller degree, increased revenue from enrollments charged the health fee. Those funds will be available for non-recurring expenses during fiscal year 2019-2020.

All revenues are deposited in a central Health Fee account prior to distribution t o the various units. (5) The favorable variance in expenses was driven by both divisions primarily in Sala ries and Benefits and Operating Expenses (though th e main driver for the variance was in the delay of CAPS hires and other vacancies). (6) Academic & Student Affairs a. Favorable variance in health fee revenues under Student Affairs are a result of increased enrollment and lower b ad debt. The excess funds are allocated toward non-recurring expenses in subsequent years. Since the excess funds represent a favorable b alance for one year, they can only be used for one-time expenditures in future years (as opposed to things such as salaries, w hich are recurring). b. Academic & Student Affairs used $145k of salary sav ings on temporary personnel services to offset the delays caused by the challenge in hiring additional counselors. (7) Health Clinics a. Health Fee: savings of $316k deriv ed from vacancies in the clinics; these savings were transferred back to the centra lized health fee account. b. Other Auxiliary Services: negative variance deriv ed from the increase in revenues from fees for service (FFS) from the Pharmacy, MMC Clinic, and BBC Clinic. c. Change in Net Assets: reflect a positive net change due to revenues from MMC and BBC f ees for service.

In other words, is a student who pays the health fee able to seek clinical, counseling, psychological, disability, victim advocacy, and/or wellness services? The answer to that question is yes. Utilization , on the other hand, is the usage amount of said resources and services by those who pay the health fee. The term \"penetration rate ,\" which is the percentage of discrete students who use health services, is also referred to as utilization. An increase in utilization of health services by those students that pay the fee is of the utmost importance. The graphs and charts that follow illustrate the hours of operation at both MMC and BBC as well as utilization rates and impact reports by unit (inclusive of patient visits and outreach efforts) from fiscal year 2016-2017 through 2018-2019 by service area. ACCESS: As noted earlier, the Student Health Fee is allocated among six main service units: Athletic Training Services (ATS), Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), Disability Resource Center (DRC), Health Promotion Services (HPS), Student Health Clinics (SHC), and Victim Empowerment Program (VEP). \"Access\" to these areas are based on those students that pay the health fee and can visit their respective offices. The hours of operations at both Modesto A. Maidique Campus (MMC) and Biscayne Bay Campus (BBC ) are listed below.

Some services (like gyneco logy) are appointment only, while others (like dermatology) accept walk-in appointments. After regular hours of operation on-call serv ices are available by calling 305-348-2401 ext.2. (2) CAPS and VEP take emergency appointments for a ny \"student in crisis,\" and there are after -hours clinicians and advocates available 24/7 by calling 305-348-2277. (3) The times for Athletic Training do not reflect time providing service for club intramural spo rts, which are dependent on scheduling of games - usually in evenings and weekends. (4) All offices are open during the summer, but some departments work slightly reduced hours. L ikewise, some offices extend hours during peak times. Page 47 of 161 44 UTILIZATION: The various units responsible for delivering quality student health services have been focused on increas ing the utilization provided to the FIU student population. As depicted by the chart and table below, utilization rates have kept pace with the increase in the number of students that pay the health fee. The largest increase has been in outreach efforts. The strategy behind this is two-fold: (1) marketing around av ailable student services will increase utilization of those services, and (2) health promotion activities contributes to preventat ive care, which would free up time for health providers to see more students. 05,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,00035,00040,00045,00050,000 FY 16-17 FY 17-18 FY 18-19HEALTH FEE (Receiving Direct Services) Clinics Counseling Victim's Empowerment Health Promotion (Services) Recreation Services Disability Resource Ctr.

An integrated marketing and communications plan were initiated during fiscal year 2016-2017 and efforts have been ongoing. The joint marketing plan for Student Health at FIU was focused to promote and enhance students' awareness o n the majority of services covered by the Health Fee (i.e., SHC, HPS, CAPS, and VEP). The plan also included a university-wide survey to provide feedback regarding stude nts' knowledge of on -campus health services and effectiveness of outreach efforts. DRC and ATS were not included within the overall marketing plan since those services are to a targeted population of students. The DRC, for example, relies heavily on other departments to make referrals for students. They routinely provide brochures and branded bookmarks to Orientation, table at large events, and conduct training for peer advisors, Panther Camp facilitators, FIU tour guides, housing and residential life staff. In addition, they attend and present at faculty department meetings and First Year Student Experience classes in order to engage with faculty, who can refer students who appear to be struggling academically. Each department continued to individually promote services throughout the year such as tabling, flyers, social media campaigns and other outreach efforts. This marketing plan sought to provide widespread promotion of on-campus services that benefit students' general health and wellness and to drive students to see the Student Health Center as a \"One Stop\" for all health needs. Target Audience : Students Goals : Promote and increase students' knowledge and utilization of health -related services available on-campus. Educate students about the health fee and what services cost. Understand if students are aware of on-campus services and ascertain why students may or may not use these services regularly. Page 60 of 161 57 Key Messages : The Student Health Fee funds affordable health care on-campus, exclusively for students. Drive students to the Student Health Center to learn ways to improve or maintain their health. Most services at the Student Health Center are covered by the health fee for students, including general medicine visits and seeing a doctor for a common cold. SHC staff can also address common student needs, such as stress, anxiety, STIs, vaccines and relationship help.

(2) The \"Wellness & Recreation \" we suspect had the greatest spike due to the physical expansion and new services/events offered in 2018. (3) The \"Requesting and Academic Accommodation\" link is now more visible on the DRC homepage. For FY 2018-2019, page views for the updated link are actually at 6,106. Page 62 of 161 59 Marketing Initiatives Accomplished The following marketing and communications initiatives were completed throughout the fiscal years from 2016-2017 through 2018-2019: PHASE 1 Added all student health fee-funded departments to FIU Mobile App to increase exposure to students Updated all student health fee-funded departments on FIU Phonebook to ensure all locations and phone numbers are accurate Updated student health fee-funded department websites to ensure accuracy, consistency and transparency regarding costs for services; as well as improve all landing page visuals and functionality Updated campus maps in print, on websites, and in FIU Mobile App to reflect \"SHC - Student Health Center\" for both MMC and BBC locations Connect my.fiu.edu to the Student Health Portal o Student Portal includes online appointment scheduling as well as print out physician instructions, discharge instructions, print receipt of services, view lab results, print immunization history, and fill out medical forms. More specifically, a student can make appointments at MMC and BBC for Gynecology and General Medicine based on symptoms. Printed and distributed Student Health at FIU brochures and inserts to students at major on-campus events Utilized digital message boards around campus for topical news items and seasonal campaigns (e.g., flu season) Worked with the student newspaper and external relations to highlight health services available to students for upcoming issues PHASE 2 Conducted additional campaigns and distributed giveaways (e.g., #HealthyCampusWeek) Partnered with Student Government Association to expand annual Health Fair, and collaborated with multiple departments to be present Produced collateral materials that promote health fee-funded services for each unit Page 63 of 161 60 PHASE 3 Student Health at FIU brochures were updated and reprinted to be distributed to students at key events A Student Health Fee-Funded Services survey was distributed in Fall 2018 to measure students' knowledge, familiarity, and usage of various health services at FIU (including services provided by the Healthy Living Program, Disability Resource Center, Counseling and Psychological Services, the Victim Empowerment Program, and the Clinic) o A total of 2,973 responses were recorded (a larger the usual response rate for voluntary student surveys) o The survey results (executive summary and full report) are included in subsequent pages Articles were featured on News@FIU related to making healthy choices and ways to prevent getting sick during the semester Continued maintenance of websites Page 64 of 161 61 Fall 2018 Survey Results FIU Student Health: Knowledge, Familiarity and Usage of Health Services Survey Results Executive Summary The current report briefly summarizes results from a survey on FIU students' knowledge, familiarity, and usage of various health services at FIU. This includes services provided by the Healthy Living, Disability Resource Center, Counseling and Psychological Services, the Victim Empowerment Program, and the Health Care Network. Additionally, the analysis offers a synopsis of student responses across various demographic and institutional variables (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender, student level, etc.). A total of 2,973 responses were recorded. The report was submitted on October 19, 2018 and was produced by Cristina Jaramillo, Account Manager, External Relations and Danilo Le Sante, Director of Assessment, Division of Academic and Student Affairs. Key findings \"Over 50% of students were aware of at least one of the health services offered by FIU. Specifically, registered students were most aware of the Student Health Clinic (79%), however, they were least aware of Victim Empowerment Services (52%) and the Disabi lity Resource Center (52%).\" Overall, 75% of students were aware of the student health fee. Moreover, 41% of students reported using at least one of the health services offered at FIU. Familiarity and usage varied across all health services. However, students were most familiar with counseling services (74%). The most frequently used health service was doctor visits (16%). Approximately 64% of online students reported that they would likely use online mental health screenings and tele mental health services. Nonetheless, over 50% of all other students (i.e., MMC, BBC, Engineering, etc.) reported that they would likely use these online resources if available. Approximately 25% of students were unaware that health services were available to them via the student health fee. Students also reported that knowing more about the health services provided would encourage them to utilize these resources more frequently. Improved promotion of these services may support increased usage. Page 65 of 161 62 I. Familiarity and Usage of FIU Health Services We first examined students' awareness of the available health services on campus. Specifically, we asked students which FIU departments offer ed free healthcare services to registered students. Additionally, we asked students if these services were promoted effectively. Table 1 Effective Promotion and Awareness of Free Healthcare Service by Department FIU Health Service Students Awareness Promoted Effectively Student Health Clinic 2,360 79% 61% Counseling and Program 1,710 58% 58% We examined the familiarity and usage of FIU health services across all students surveyed (n=2,973). Responses were analyzed for each student health service at FIU. Figure 1. Overall familiarity and usage of Student Health Services at FIU We also analyzed student responses by demographics, knowledge of the health fee, familiarity, and usage of FIU health services. We examined responses by department according to the services offered (i.e., the Healthy Living Program, Disability Resource Center, Counseling and Psychological Services, Victim Empowerment Program, and the Health Care Network) (see Tables 2-6).

Page 72 of 161 69 II. Usage of FIU Health Services across student demographics The following analyses examined student usage of FIU health services. Specifically, we sought to understand why students did not utilize FIU health services, how frequently they used health services, and whether there was a demand for online resources. Table 7 Reasons why students did not use Health Care Services at FIU Age Group N I receive medical care outside of FIU. I have not had the need to use it.

Page 76 of 161 73 Proposal for 2019-2020 Given the recent reorganization for Student Health & Wellness, marketing needs to be re-evaluated. The new AVP of Student Health and Wellness is using the following approach to guide how services are provided and marketed to our students. The following are priority areas for the upcoming year: - Philosophy and Brand : The Provost has expressed a desire for FIU to be designated by the World Health Organization as a health promoting university. While this designation is much larger that student health, we are a large constituent group. Our programming, outreach, marketing, and culture should pivot to align with the institution's goals. - Digital Media o Social Media: There are too many accounts and campaigns, few of which coordinate marketing efforts. Consolidation and rebranding are required. o Websites: It is not user friendly, and information is inaccurate / missing. Consolidation and rebranding are required. - Programming and Outreach: There is a lot of duplication of efforts. Consolidation and rebranding are required. - Organizational Structure: Currently, marketing and outreach efforts are dispersed across different units. Unity of vision, goals, and messaging is needed. The AVP of Student Health and Wellness has scheduled a marketing retreat in December 2019. A proposal will be drafted by February 2020, with approval prior to the 2020-2021 budget cycle commencing.

The following report provides an update of recent SISH health -related activities . BIOMOLECULAR SCIENCES INSTITUTE (BSI) Director: Dr. Yuk -Ching Tse -Dinh The first cohort pre -doctoral students the NIGMS T32 \"Transdisciplinary Biomolecular and Biomedical Sciences\" (TBBS) training program has been selec ted for support beginning fall 2019. The four first -year and four second -year Ph .D. students are enrolled in the FIU graduate programs of the departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Physics , as well as the interdisciplinary Biochemistry Ph.D. program under CASE, the Environmental Health Sciences Ph .D. program in the Robert Stempel College of Public Health and Social Work ( RSCPHSW ), and the Biomedical Sciences Ph .D. program in the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine (HWCOM ). The students have been encouraged to submit individual graduate fellowship application s to the National Scie nce Foundation ( NSF ) and/or the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) for support following the T32 fellowship. A retreat for TBBS mentors and trai nees took place in November, 2019, to provide an opportunity for exchange of information on research interests for future collaborations across the multiple disciplines. Many BSI faculty and their collaborators have received patents this yea r for their inventions, including Drs. Kalai Mathee, Shekhar Bhansali, Yi Xiao, Yuk , Marcus Cooke , and Francisco Bhargav Guntupalli a Janak Paudyal, are co- Dr. Yi Xiao's patent (Patent 1029038). Dr. Fernandez- Lima and postdoctoral fellow Kevin Jeanne Dit Fouque were awar ded a U.S. pate nt for their Page 83 of 161FIU Board of Trustees Health Affairs Committee School of Integrated Science and Humanity Upd ate December 5, 2019 Page | 2 invention \"Materials and methods for screening topoisomers\" (Patent 10,386,372). This tool will be useful for identifying potential therapeutic drug candidates and will h ave broad application for the screening of proteins with u nique compositions. A high throughput tool, it is capable of separating proteins by their structure and se quence under physiological conditions. Their publication, \"Exploring the Conformat of Growth -Hormone -Releasing Hormone Using Dopa nt Assisted Trapped Ion Mobility SpectrometryMass Spectrometry ,\" with undergra duate student Javier Moreno as a coauthor, was recently highlighted in the 2019 Journal of Physical Chemistry 's \"Young Scientists \" Virtual Special Issue . CENTER FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES (CCF) Director: Dr. William E. Pelham , Jr. The Center for Children and Families (CCF) is an interdisciplinary team of r esearchers and service providers committed to improving the lives of children with menta l health problems , and the lives of their families. The CCF is the leading provider of evidence - based services for children in Miami. Since its establishment in 2010, it ha s served thousands of families across clinical and clinical research programs, wit h an average of 3,000 to 3, 500 families per year over the last several years. Our Summer Treatment Programs (STP) and Brave Bunch program (which targets children struggl ing with Selective Mutism) served a combined 321 children during the summer of 2 019. The CCF Summer Reading Explor ers Program, funded by The Children's Trust, is an intervention that is designed to improve literacy skills in young children. It served an impressive 2,088 children during the summer of 2019. The CCF also offers a v ariety of parenting programs through our year- round clinic, including the Incredible Years program, a 12- week group -based parenting intervention funded by The Children's Trust. Additionally, the CCF clinic has been funded by The Children's Trust to provide Universal Parenting Interventions in 60 + locations throughout Miami -Dade County. Finally, the CCF is one of the approved contractors providing mental health assessment and intervention services for children referred by Miami -Dade County Public Schools (MDCPS ). In total, we served 3,427 children/families in FY 2019 across clinical and clinical research activities, and we are on track to serving a similar number of children during this current fiscal year. The CCF continues to offer important training opportunities to our faculty, stude nts and staff, a s well as community professionals. In FY'19, we offered seven Speaker Series events, with nationally renowned experts in the field, and held five free Community Workshops that focused on important issues around parenting. We Page 84 of 161FIU Board of Trustees Health Affairs Committee School of Integrated Science and Humanity Upd ate December 5, 2019 Page | 3 recently (October 18, 2 019) held the first Speaker Series workshop of a planned eight for FY'20, in which Dr. John E. Lochman, an endowed professor from the University of Alabama, discussed his research and met with faculty and staff. With s upport from The Children's Trust and t he MDCPS, the CCF hosted the Miami International Child and Adolescent Mental Health Conference [MICAMH] in February 2019, for which more than 550 mental health professionals and students registered. Over th ree days , the conference provided keynote addresse s and workshops on child/adolescent mental health and contemporary topics provided by nationally known experts. We have offered Continuing Education Units to licensed mental health professiona ls through our training opportunities, providing more than 2,300 CEs across all our training opportunities in FY '19. Our grants and scholarly productivity have remained high. FY ' 19 was a very successful year where 13 CCF faculty obtained 15 new awards, two supplements to existing awards and three contracts to include CCF's (and FIU's) first T32 Training Grant (from NIDA), fou NIH R01s, one Institute of Education Sciences (IES) award, five five-year Children's Trust awards, one R21 NIH award, one K23 NIH award, one R03 NIH award, one foundation grant with the Universit y of Texas/Southwestern Medical Center, one supplement to an R01, one contract with Baptist Medical Center and two contracts for mental health services by the CCF clinic to MDCPS students. Since then, the CCF faculty have obtained one additional NIH R01, another IES award, a National Library of Medicine G08 and another supplement to an R01. The CCF curren tly has 19 faculty funded with 48 multi -year awards amounting to a total of $79.8M in external funding primarily from federal agencie s (the NIH , the IES, the NSF ) and The Children's Trust. Lastly , in FY '19, our faculty produced 168 publications (peer -reviewed articles and edited book chapters) and were featured in 77 articles/interviews in th e media, including many in popular national and local media outlets. Integration within the greater AHC and University : The CCF has been involved in the integration of all relevant departments into the AHC. Since its inception , we have been serving on the recently established HIPAA committee, made up of representatives from all AHC entities. Similarly, we have been involved in the enterprise -level HIPAA assessment, meant to strengthen the HIPAA program of FIU and the AHC. CCF has maintained representation in the various Search and Screen Committees for the Director of Health Compliance, who represents the AHC. The CCF now has a representat ive on the board of the FIU Self -Insurance Program, which is also a resource for the AHC. At a University level, two individuals from the CCF (Ms. Bisono -Gonzalez a nd Dr. Pelham) were involved in the strategic planning for the Next Horizon Campaign. As a Preeminent Program, the CCF Director is part of the Preeminent and Emerging Preeminent Program group that gathers periodically to discuss enterpris e-level issues. Page 85 of 161FIU Board of Trustees Health Affairs Committee School of Integrated Science and Humanity Upd ate December 5, 2019 Page | 4 As noted above, the CCF and its collaborators received a T32 grant from NIDA. T his collaboration includes the RSCPHSW 's Crusada Center and the Department of Epidemiology. In terms of affiliation, although most CCF -affiliated faculty belong to the Department of Psychology, we also have faculty affiliates from FIU's Steven J. Green School of International and Public Affairs , Nicole W ertheim of College of Nursing & Health Sciences, Biostatistics, the Department of Health Policy and Manage ment, and HWCOM (this individual faculty member - Dr. Sibley - recently separated from FIU, but maintains a courtesy appointment). In the past, anothe r HWCOM -affiliated CCF faculty member (Dr. Waxmonsky) parted ways with the University for Penn State. As a Preeminent Program, the CCF has potential hiring lines for researchers i n the field of child and adolescent mental health, and we are happy to collab orate with HWCOM and other AHC colleges and departments in this endeavor. In addition , the CCF has contributed a portion of grant Indirect Cost Return for the purchase and us e of the FIU MRI scanner (over a quarter- million dollars over the last four years) , which supports a large portion of many grants funded to CCF faculty by the NIH at FIU that include magnetic resonance imaging as part of their protocols. Resolve optimization within greater AHC and University : The CCF collaborates with most FIU centr al departments to optimize resources. For example, we have been working with the Health Care Network in preparation for billing insuranc e for our services. As mentioned above, we are a part of the University -wide HIPAA committee, and work closely with the Office of Compliance, the General Counsel's office, Office of Research and Economic Development (ORED) , Advancement, and External Relations, among others, to ensure successful operations. Avoiding duplication of resources : In order to maximize efficient use of space, all CCF space, equipment, and facilities are shared/shareable across members/clinics/researchers within the CCF; a nd, the CCF space on the ground floor in AHC 1, AHC 5, and portions of PG5 are shared with faculty from RSCPHSW and FIU's Center for Imaging Science. CENTER FOR IMAGING SCIENCE (CIS) Director: Dr. Angela Laird The Center for Imaging Science (CIS) is a multidisciplinary research cen ter housed in FIU's ORED. As part of a nationwide project, FIU was awarded a landmark NIH $12.7 million grant in 2015 to conduct research for the Adolescent Brain Cogniti ve Development (ABCD) study. Considered the largest long -term study of brain development and child health in the United States, the team -based, open -science model Page 86 of 161FIU Board of Trustees Health Affairs Committee School of Integrated Science and Humanity Upd ate December 5, 2019 Page | 5 will make collected data available to scientists around the world in order to adva nce understanding and research in the field. The CIS includes a research -dedicated facility for a 3T Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scann er, installed in August 2016. This Prisma MRI is equipped to run the Human Connectome and ABCD Protocols which entails state -of-the-art mu ltiband data acquisition, advanced motion correction (PROMO), echo planar imaging (EPI), distortion c orrection (EPIC), with ultra -fast data acquisition facilitating high angular resolution diffusion - weighted imaging (HARDI) - in place of diffusion tensor i maging (DTI) - and high - resolution, sub -second repetition time (RT) EPI acquisition. The CIS Steering Committee has approved a total of 25 projects, with three ad ditional projects currently under review and pending approval. Since the last update to the FIU Board of Trustees , six of these projects are new while two have successfully concluded. As of October 2019, there are 12 active projects led by 18 PIs or Co- PIs from three colleges at FIU, including CASE , RSCPHSW , and HWCOM . Seven of these projects are externally funded by the NIH, including two U01s, one U54, three R01s, one R21, as well as P01 and U01 subawards from the University of Florida; one is fun ded by an internal FIU pilot and two are funded by pharmaceutical companies . We support 215 active C IS facility users, and have provided facility and safety training to an additional 179 researchers who are no longer active. Our studies are re cruiting, enrolling, and scanning healthy children and young adults, children with ADHD and anxiety disorders, te ens who smoke e -cigarettes, older adults, adults with liver disease, and adults with HIV. We are currently the only MRI facility that is capable of conducting human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and MR elastography studies; thus, we pr ovid e a unique resource to FIU researchers. Our current efforts to improve servi ces are focusing on developing facility resources for data quality assurance and pre -processing pipelines. These services will reduce duplication of effort across projects and team s, thereby providing additional shared data resources for investigators to dr aw upon. During the Summer of 2019, we hired an additional full -time MR I techn ician to expand our hours of operation, providing additional service to users. The CIS provides res earch educational training opportunities to FIU undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows. We provide part -time employment to five undergraduate student assistants, and give them valuable training and professional development opp ortunities. Finally, over the past year we have provided research educational trainin g to our users, including the Coastal Coding Workshop held at the Biscayne Bay C ampus in January Page 87 of 161FIU Board of Trustees Health Affairs Committee School of Integrated Science and Humanity Upd ate December 5, 2019 Page | 6 2019, the CIS Data Boot Camp held at the Modesto A. Maidique Campus for two weeks in August 2019, and we provide monthly MRI safety training workshops that are available to all FIU personnel and are required for CIS users. In addition, Dr. Laird Kramer submitted an R25 proposal to NIH in October 2019 to provide support for research educational training in reproducible data analytics for ABCD data. Page 88 of 161 FIU Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine Report to the Board of Trustees Health Affairs Committee December 2019 HWCOM REPORT Key Institutional Distinctions: Receipt of ASPIRE Award In 2019, t he Association for Medical Education in Europe (AMEE) once again recognized the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine's unique approach to medical education, which focuses on social accountability and the social determinants of health. HWCOM is the first recipient of AMEE's ASPIRE-to-Excellence Award for Inspirational Approaches to Health Professions Education. HWCOM had previously received the ASPIRE-to-Excellence Award in Social Accountability (2016). Receipt of Alpha Omega Alpha Professionalism Award In 2019, the national Alpha Omega Alpha (AA, or \"AOA\") Honor Medical Society honored the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine with its Edward D. Harris Professionalism Award, which recognizes best practices in medical professionalism education. HWCOM was cited specifically for its professional curriculum, \"The Professional Development Strand.\" In 2019, HWCOM was also awarded an Alpha Omega Alpha Student Service Leadership Project Grant. First Graduating Class of FIU Combined MD/Healthcare MBA The FIU MD/Healthcare MBA was launched in 2017\u2014by the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine and the College of Business Chapman Graduate School\u2014to address the increasing need for better understanding of the economics and business implications of healthcare delivery. This past April, Alyssa Kimble and David Wilding became the first students to graduate from this combined degree program. Page 89 of 161FIU Board of Trustees Health Affairs Committee Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine Update December 5, 2019 Page 2 Student Achievement Distinctions: 18 HWCOM students were inducted into the Alpha Omega Alpha Medical Honor Society. Chet Ojha was awarded a PhD in Biomedical Sciences. During his research at HWCOM, Ojha worked in the lab of Nazira El-Hage, in the Department of Immunology and Nanomedicine, studying how the Zika virus reaches the brain in order to invade and kill neurons and other brain cells. Reinier Alvarez , M3, was one of only 50 medical students nation-wide chosen to participate in the NIH's prestigious Medical Research Scholars Program. He is spending this year working with some of the best clinicians and scientists in the world working on cutting-edge research at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Krissie Lobon , M1, was accepted to the 2019 Medical Student Training in Aging Research (MSTAR) Program at Johns Hopkins. The program provides medical students with an enriching experience in aging related research and geriatrics, with the mentorship of top experts in the field. Ms. Lobon participated in a 12 week structured research program in geriatrics. Thomas Weppelman , Class of 2020, received an honorable mention in the American Medical Association Accelerating Change in Medical Education's inaugural Health Systems Science Student Impact Competition for his research, \" Controlling Cholera in the West Department of Haiti Using Oral Cholera Vaccines \". Weppelman also was named a 2019 G.E.R.M. Awardee by the Infectious Disease Society of America's Foundation. He received a $4,000 stipend for his research. Irfan Khan , M2, was elected as the AAMC Southern Region Organization Student Representative Delegate for Student Affairs. Match Day Results Once again, HWCOM students matched into some of the most prestigious residency programs in the nation (including Mayo Clinic, UCLA, Georgetown, Vanderbilt, and Emory). Of the 119 FIU students who entered the match, 47 percent will complete residencies in primary care specialties; 47 percent will be doing their internship in Florida; and 27 percent will continue their residency training in South Florida. These Page 90 of 161FIU Board of Trustees Health Affairs Committee Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine Update December 5, 2019 Page 3 numbers are significant due to the critical need for primary care physicians nationwide, and the tendency for doctors to stay and practice in the vicinity of where they trained. Key Research Distinctions: Irina Agoulnik and Alexander Agoulnik , professors in the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, in collaboration with Juan Jose Marugan, Jingbo Xiao, Marc Ferrer-Alegre, Catherine Chen, Noel Southall, Wei Zheng, and other inventors at NIH, have been awarded a patent for their invention \"Modulators of the relaxin receptor 1\". HWCOM researchers are part of an international team that has discovered a new broad- spectrum antibiotic that contains arsenic. The study, published in Nature's Communication Biology, is a collaboration between Barry P. Rosen, Masafumi Yoshinaga , Venkadesh Sarkarai Nadar and others from of Cellular Biology and Pharmacology, and Satoru Ishikawa and Masato Kuramata from the Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, NARO in Japan. The newly founded Department of Translational Medicine has achieved international recognition over the last year in the field of translational glycobiology. Translational Medicine Professors, Robert Sackstein and Charles Dimitroff, were both awarded NIH Alliance of Glycobiologists for Cancer Research (U01) grants - 2 of only 9 grants awarded across the US. These major collaborative multi-year grants totaling more than $6M are designed to advance basic glycobiology findings on the pathogenesis of leukemias and on the metastasis of melanomas to improve clinical care. Knowledge of how a cancer progresses and spreads through the body is critical because these later stages of disease are often met with a poor prognosis. Work proposed in these grants aims to reveal how key sugars on the surface of human leukemic cells and human melanoma cells can be therapeutically targeted to undercut disease progression.

From their initial pool, they ranked programs acc ording to five factors: Tuition Cost Reputation Alumni Salary Graduation Rate Job Placement Rate FIU Nursing and Miami Veterans Affairs Awarded Funding to Launch Florida's Only VA -Funded Psychiatric -Mental Health Nurse Practitioner Residency Program The U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) Office of Academic Affiliations (OAA) has awarded funding for four resident stipends to Florida International University's Nic ole Wertheim College of Nursing and Health Sciences and the Miami VA Healthcare System (Miami VA) to launch Florida's only Psychiatric -Menta l Health Nurse Practitioner Residency Program under the VA's Nurse Residency Expans ion Initiative. Up to four actively licensed advanced registered nurse practitioners (A RNP) will be recruited from South Florida annually to receive clinical training in t he delivery of psychiatric -mental and behavioral health care to patients at the Miami VA. FIU Graduate Nursing faculty will oversee recruitment and didactic education, while Miami VA practitioners will serve as preceptors for the residents during their yearlong clinical tenure. \"The mission of this much -needed residency program is to enhance these specialized competencies for nurse practitioners wishing to serve the veteran patien t population while creating a pool of well -educated and well -qualified professionals to fill future clinical practitioner needs in the VA system,\" said Ora L. Strickland, dean of the college. Difficulty recruiting qualified ARNPs to fill recurring vacancies within the Miami VA Psychiatric Services unit propelled this latest educa tion-workforce alliance. The two institutions have enjoyed a highly effective collegial partnership going ba ck more than a Page 112 of 161FIU Board of Trustee s Health Affairs Committee Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing and Health Sciences Update December 5, 2019 Page 7 decade when the Miami VA began serving as a clinical rotation site for FIU n ursing students. In 2014, the relationship was augmented when the OAA awarded FIU Nursing and the Miami VA $8.2 million to establish the Veterans Affairs Nursing Academic P artnership (VANAP). Since then, nearly 120 FIU undergraduate nursing students ha ve followed a veteran -centric clinical training curriculum f ocused on the care and management of health problems predominant to military veterans and active service mem bers such as PTSD, TBI, chemical exposure and traumatic limb loss. Also stemming from that grant was the Post -Baccalaureate Nurse Residency (PBNR) program to increase nurse recruitment and retention for the VA hospital system. All 20 nurses who completed the 12 -month residency were retained on staff by the Miami VA, joining the 16 FIU VANAP students who were hired back upon graduation. According to Miami VA's Marcia Lysaght, associate director of patient care services, the clinical and operational effectiveness of these earlier joint efforts h as set similarly high expectations for the Psychiatric -Mental Health Nurse Practitioner Residency initiative with FIU. \"Our partnership with the NWCNHS has proved to be an unprecedented succes s for the Miami VA, bolstering our nursing workforce and lowering our recruitme nt and retention costs by more than $2 million per year,\" said Lysaght. \"Furthermore , we hav e witnessed clinical patient outcomes improve because of the quality o f care delivered by the FIU -trained nurses in these programs. It is a major reason why our PBNR has th e rare distinction of being one of the few in the nation to receive accreditation from the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.\" FIU Occupational Therapy Program Garners 10 -Year Re- Accreditation The FIU Occupational Therapy Program hosted an onsite re -accreditation visit from the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE\u00ae) for our Occupational Therapy (OT) program on February 4 -6, 2019 and garnered a re- accreditation for 10 -years. The Occupational Therapy (OT) Program was created in 1975 to award a professional entry-level Bachelor of Science in OT. In 2004, th e entry- level Bachelor of Science in Occupational Therapy program was terminated a nd replaced by the Bachelor of Heal th Sciences Occupational Therapy track leading to the entry -level Professional Master of Science in OT. The Bachelor of Health Scien ces and all tracks were terminated in 2010. During the 2008-2009 academic year, the Departme nt Page 113 of 161FIU Board of Trustee s Health Affairs Committee Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing and Health Sciences Update December 5, 2019 Page 8 revised the entry -level Profe ssional Master of Science in Occupational Therapy curriculum and began enrolling all students and offering all courses at t he graduate level.

Introduction and Background The Florida International University Academic Health Center Hea lth Care Network (FIU-HCN) supports the mission of the Florida Internatio nal University (FIU), improves and supports health education at FIU Herbert W e r t h e i m C o l l e g e o f M e d i c i n e ( H W C O M ) ; R o b e r t S t e m p e l C o l l e g e o f Public Health and Social Work (RSCPHSW); Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing and Health Scienc es (NWCNHS); and departments in the College of Arts, Sciences and Education (CASE) with clinical ac tivities. FIU-HCN is organized as a not-for-profit corporation under Chapter 617, Florida Statutes. FIU-HCN developed as a full risk clinical model at its inceptio n on 2010. In fiscal year 2015-2016, the FIU-HCN transitioned from a full risk clinical model to a Management Se rvices Organization model (MSO). On July 2015, new leadership was appointed and FIU transferred the mana gement of student health clinics to FIU- HCN. Under the current structure, as an MSO, FIU-HCN manag es th e following units: HWCOM clinical sites at the MMC and Broward; Student Health Clinic and pharmacy at MMC and Student Health Clinic at BBC campuses; HWCOM International Program; Embrace program under OR ED and leases for the ACC FIU-HCN building occupied by Nicolaus Children's Hospital Ambulatory Su rgery Center. On July 2015, a new CEO was appointed and approved by the FIU Health Care Network Board of Directors. The FIU Health Care Network Board of Directors current ly consis ts of: Designee of the President of Florida International University also serving on the Board of Trustees; Provost of Florida International University; Chief Financial Officer of Florida International University; Se nior Vice-President of Health Affairs/Dean of College of Medicine (HWCOM); Dean of the College of Nursing (NW CN H S ); D e an of th e C olleg e of Pu b lic Health (RSCPHSW); the Dean of the College of Arts and Sci ences (CASE) or a clinical faculty member of the CASE designated by the Dean of the CASE; HWCOM Executive As sociate Dean for Clinical Affairs; non-chair clinical faculty; one HWCOM clinical chair faculty; a n d u p t o f i v e c o m m u n i t y m e m b e r s , s o m e appointed at the discretion of the FIU President. At least one of the aforementioned members should have expertise in finances and is appointed Finance and Audit Chair of the Board of Directors. Prior to July 2015, FIU-HCN focused on expansion of the HWC OM faculty plan. Rapidly changing healthcare environment in addition to the needs across the University, hel ped embark the FIU-HCN into a different more comprehensive model aligning competencies, tasks and operations with financial structure that involved collaboration across other FIU colleges. The units mana ged unde r FIU-HCN have distinct needs. Some units are engaged in clinical services and delivery while others are focused on expansion of educational offerings in a global market. Under new leadership and model, the task was to realign the FIU -HCN structure into a management service organization that would manage the different units of the FIU A cademic Health Center as previously stated in the introduction. Leadership embarked on a plan that consist ed of four pillars: Stabilization and due diligence; Realignment to MSO model; Managing expectations and defining roles under the new MSO model; and Growth. The plan was completed fiscal year 2016-2017 ending on June 201 7. For the past FY 2017-2018 and beyond, the FIU-HCN team will continue to focus on financial stability, sustainability and growth for the MSO and its stakeholders. The FIU-HCN had changes in management oversight and responsibil ities thus changing reporting lines. Prior to July 2015, the faculty that practiced in the HWCOM clini cs reported to the leadership of the health care network. On July 2015 and thereafter, the faculty reports to th e HWCOM Chair of the respective department. The clinical support staff of the HWCOM clinics report to FIU-H CN leadership management team for purposes of administrative and clinical o perations. At student health cl inics and Pharmacy, the administrative staff 3 Page 121 of 161reports directly to the FIU-HCN leadership management team and the clinical staff reports directly to the clinical team at the student health clinics with oversight from FIU-HCN. At the student health clinics there is integration of daily operations beyond management oversight. FI U-HCN and Student Health Wellness (CAPS) are part of the governance structure for all Student Health Ser vices through their participation in the Joint Governance Committee (JGC), a committee convened by President R osenberg. The staff from the HWCOM Office of International Affairs reports directly to the Chief E xecutive Officer of the FIU-HCN who also serves as the Associate Dean for International Affairs. The Chief Executive Officer reports directly to the FIU Health Care Network Board of Directors. The direct and matrix reportin g provides the best form of integration across the operation of the respective units. In this manner, leadersh ip and staff have shared responsibility and held accountable for key performance indicators and unit specific pe rformance. As part of the 90-day plan and within fiscal year 2015-2016, FI U-HCN team accomplished several milestones in collaboration with its stakeholders. FIU-HCN established rol e and responsibilities as a management service o r g a n i z a t i o n a c r o s s a l l s t a k e h o l d e r s a n d b e g a n t o b u i l d t h e F I U -HCN management team to provide the services tasked to the MSO. These services include: operations and personnel management; leadership management; revenue cycle management; operation process improve ment; accounting and financial management and reporting; budget planning and implementation; a nd business development. An important focus for FIU-HCN was realignment of the revenue cycle management, comprehen sive credentialing process, and dashboard reporting to successfully attain optimization of revenue and commitment to operation process improvement. FIU-HCN committed to increase visibility a cross the campus and participate in all and any health care event representi ng Florida International Univer sity and stakeholders. A t t h e H W C O M M M C A m b u l a t o r y C a r e C e n t e r ( A C C ) , i n c o l l a b o r a t i o n with the HWCOM Department of Humanities, Health and Society, FIU-HCN increased access in pri m a r y c a r e . I n a d d i t i o n , g r e a t e f f o r t w a s placed to enhance visibility and marketing of services across U niversity campus. A new tri-party Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed with the FIU Offic e of Research and Economic Development (ORED) and HWCOM to manage the Embrace program at t he HWCOM MMC/ACC and Broward clinics. Embrace is a comprehens ive health care delivery for ad ults with autism spectrum disorder and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of the Embrace program i s to develop a comprehensive program that would deliver multispecialty services to this special popu lation. For the past three years, the HWCOM faculty practice has increa sed both primary care and specialty care in areas such as Dermatology. This expansion contributed to increa se patient visits, referrals and net patient revenue. Visits at the Faculty group practice (FGP) has see n an increase of approximately 34% growth over the past three years. This is reflected by an upward trend in c linical patient revenue. Overall other successful metrics that have contributed to upward trends include: reduced no shows through the implementation of patient reminders; increased same day appointments by an averag e of 13% (MGMA benchmark is 10% as patients; opt imization of credentialing process, revenue cycle management and operation process improvement. In addition , workflow optimization has provided cost savings to HWCOM and monthly reporting to HWCOM and Depart ment Chairs has contributed to enhance collaboration and operation improvement. Implementation of dashboard reports was essential to monitor key performance indicators and make informed decisions on operations. (See section V.) At the student health clinics and pharmacy services, realignmen t of operations within the first FIU-HCN 90- day focused on efficiencies across the management layer and exp a n d i n g h e a l t h c a r e s e r v i c e s t o t h e F I U student body. The realignment was successful and produced an an nualized savings of $1.2M in FY 2015-2016. It expanded services and specialized service health care to stu dents in the areas of Gynecology, Dermatology, 4 Page 122 of 161and Behavioral Health. These services continue to be a focu s of expansion with other enhancements. The outcome of the realignment was presented to the FIU Board of Trustees on December 2015. Expansion of services contributed to increase student visits and no-show rat e has remained stable at 4% since FY 2015- 2 0 1 6 .

Another important miles tone was the renegotiation of the Collective Bargaining units at student health clinics. An extended three-y ear contract was successfully signed in 2017. Currently, there is no third-party billing at student health cl inics except for the University-sponsored health insurance. FIU-HCN shares in the revenues from student heal th fee with Student Health Services/ Wellness (CAPS). FIU-HCN has the responsibility for the entire clinic op eration, services and finances. Periodic performance updates are presented to the FIU Board of Trustees. Further integration with Behavioral Health is an important focus and directive from FIU and State Leadersh ip. Members of FIU-HCN leadership and HWCOM Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health participat ed as part of the Behavioral Integration Task Force to develop a consensus report of the Florida Academi c Patient Safety Organization on Behavioral Health Integration in the University Setting.

T h e H W C O M O f f i c e f o r I n t e r n a t i o n a l A f f a i r s i n c o l l a b o r a t i o n w i t h FIU-HCN continues to increase student participation across the globe and enhance the partnership with its main partner, University of Manipal and American University of Antigua. In response to increasing stude nt participation, FIU-HCN embarked on expansion of clinical sites and faculty preceptors to accommoda te growth especially from the International Visiting Medical Student program. The international prog ram con tinues to produce successful outcomes. FIU- HCN provides financial reporting and management of all programs and manages all the MOU's for all partners and affiliates in collaboration with FIU export control, compli ance and legal department. The FIU-HCN CEO participates in the FIU Global Consortium and was appointed co- chair for the FIU Global Strategy. The international program increased from one to four programmatic o fferings and expanded to 51 countries and 240 Universities since inception in 2013. A separate five-year report has been completed illustrating its growth and future expansion and submitted to the HWCOM le adership and FIU-HCN Board of Directors. (See Section V.) FIU-HCN manages other services and units across the University. It manages credentialing for the FIU Center for Children and Families (CCF) and collaborates with other ext ernal stakeholders such as Nicklaus Children's Hospital Ambulatory Surgical Center housed in the ACC building and Gastro Health which leases space at the ACC Ambulatory Care Center.

Financial Report FIU-HCN developed as a full risk clinical model at its inceptio n on 2010. In fiscal year 2015-2016, the FIU-HCN transitioned from a full risk clinical model to a Management Se rvices Organization model (MSO). As a result, since FY 2015-2016, revenue sources for FIU-HCN derive from man agement fees. In the MSO model, FIU- HCN revenues based on management fees derive from managing the HWCOM clinics, HWCOM Office of International Affairs (OIA), FIU Student Health Clinics, ORED E mbrace, and the leases of the Ambulatory Care Center (ACC) to Nicklaus Children's Hospital and Gastro H ealth. Patient revenues and respective accounts receivables for clinical services after fiscal year 2015-2016 a nd beyond are now recorded under the HWCOM. A s p a r t o f t h e m a n a g e m e n t o f t h e H W C O M c l i n i c s a n d t h e O I A p r o g ram, the operating expenses are processed and recorded on the books of FIU-HCN under the respec tive line of business. The operating expenses of the HWCOM clinics are billed to and reimbursed by H WCOM to FIU-HCN. The expenses of the OIA program are captured along with the OIA program revenues un der the OIA line of business. By fiscal year end and after the annual audit, the net income from the OIA line of business are transferred to HWCOM to support its clinical operations. Below is a summary of each of the three-year financial model ev olution respectively. In FY15-16 FIU-HCN transitioned from a full risk clinical model to a Mana gement Services Organization model (MSO). In FY15-16, MSO revenues for the management of the HWCOM c l i n i c s w e r e b a s e d o n 1 5 % g r o s s patient charges. As a result, th e patient revenues and respecti ve AR for clinical services provided since July 2015 are no longer the revenues of FIU-HCN. The patient revenue s and patient AR deriving from the clinical servic es b eg an to g e t rec o rd ed u n d er th e b ook s of t h e H WCOM a n d th e ca sh receip ts fr o m th e ser vice s g e n e r a t e d b y t h e H W C O M c l i n i c s a r e d e p o s i t e d d i r e c t l y i n t o F I U - HWCOM bank account. The expense associated with th e salaries and benefits of the physician facu lty and the clinical support personnel were directly absorbed by HWCOM in FY15-16. Management fees rela ted to the OIA programs came directly from the University of Antigua (AUA) as a flat fee to FIU-HCN and th ey derived from the administration of the AUA Certificate Program for the Clerkship Rotation to third year me dical students. Revenues from the FIU SHS Clinics are based on 10% of the health fees allotted for the SH S Clinics and 10% from other SHS revenues such as fees for service revenues. In FY16-17 the management fees revenues from the management of the HWCOM Clinics transitioned from a 15% fees from gross clinical charges to a cost reimbursement model where HWCOM reimbursed to FIU- HCN all operating expenses for their clinics. The salaries and benefits for the clinical support staff and the operating expenses for the clinics began to be reported under t he Clinic's line of business. In this cost reimbursement model, the clinic's operating expenses also inclu ded a percent allocation of the FIU-HCN personnel salary expense. These expenses were billed to HWCOM o n a monthly basis and were recorded as Management Fee revenue in the FY16-17 under the clinics line of business on the books of FIU-HCN. The cap of this cost reimbursement model was $2.1M. The actual expenses for the clinics line of business in FY16-17 came at $108K below the cap that represented this amount in sav ings to the College of Medicine. The revenues generated from the clinical services provided by the f aculty along with the faculty salary percent effort allocation continued to be directly recorded under the b ooks of HWCOM. As a result of this transition to a cost reimbursement model, the FIU-HCN management fee reven ue stopped deriving from the 15% of gross clinical charges and began coming through via a reduction to expenses in the MSO line of business. In FY16-17 the management fees revenues for FIU-HCN from the OIA p rograms continued to include the fees paid directly by AUA for the administration of the Core Cer tificate Program plus an added 15% coming from 30 Page 148 of 161HWCOM for other OIA programmatic revenues deriving from: the AU A Fifth Semester program, AUA Electives program and the International Visiting Medical Students (IVMS) programs administered to international students through collaboration with various institutions around the world. In FY16-17 FIU-HCN also began to implement other revenue sources for the OIA line of business de riving from registration, cancellation, and change fees. The revenue structure of FIU-HCN for the managemen t fees coming from the management of the FIU SHS Clinics, Embrace and the leases remained unchanged. FY17-18 to Present ; FIU-HCN continues to operate as a Management Service Organiza tion and it stands as a self-sustained financial model absorbing the expenses aligned t o the MSO operations. The percentage of the FIU-HCN admin personnel expenses and the HWCOM IT support perso nnel previously allocated to the clinic's line of business are fully absorbed by FIU-HCN under the FIU-H CN MSO line of business. The HWCOM clinic's operating expenses are reported as a pass-through expense under the clinic's line of business through the books of FIU-HCN and they are billed to and reimbursed by H WCOM to FIU-HCN. This expense reimbursement for the operating expenses of the HWCOM clinics is recorded as \"Other Revenue\" under the clinic's line of business. In July 2017 the management fees structure for t he ma nagement of the HWCOM clinics changed to a flat amount with a cap of $250 thousand that represents ap proximately 10% of the entire clinic operations managed by FIU-HCN. These fees are recorded as Manag ement Fee revenue under the FIU-HCN MSO line of business. Effective in FY17-18 the revenues from management fees coming from OIA are inclusive of 15% of other programmatic revenues deriving from program can cellation and change fees. The management fee structure remains unchanged for the revenues der iving from the FIU SHS Clinics, Embrace and the lease The graph below illustrates the transition timeline related to the FIU-HCN financial evolution from a clinical model to an MSO model. The pages to follow include graphs that show financial outcomes for FIU-HCN for the three years reported and a graph reflecting the impact to t he FIU-HCN net income resulting from the transition to the MSO model as compared to pre-transition years . 31 Page 149 of 161 The FIU-HCN MSO graph below illust rates the FIU-HCN MSO revenue s, expenses and net income from FY2016 through FY2018 reflecting the transition into a fully su stained financial model by FY2018 where all operating expenses and revenues are aligned with the MSO model as a financially sustained unit. Revenues of the FIU-HCN MSO in FY2016 derived from 15% of gross clinical charges. FY2017 reflects lower expenses resulting from the proposed HWCOM model where they beg an to absorb all operating expenses for the clinics inclusive of the MSO personnel allocation effort which replaced the management fee from HWCOM. FY2018-19 (Forecasted) reflects the negotiated co ntract ual management fee from AUA which include the fees for the AUA ele ctives and the AUA IM1-FM1 curr ently paid by HWCOM. On October 2018, the new management fee will incl ude the programs managed by FIU -HCN for AUA up to cap as per contract. All other management fees remain unchanged. As part of the evolution period in FY2016, some of the clinic e xpenses such as the Centricity and Patient- Keeper system were part of the FIU-HCN MSO expenses and later t ransition to the clinics in FY2017. Also, in FY2017, the expenses for FIU-HCN MSO reflect savings related to personnel expense allocation to the HWCOM clinics. In FY2018 FIU-HCN MSO fully absorbed 100% of the ir MSO personnel expenses and all other expenses aligned to the MSO operations.

For FY2016-17 HWCOM proposed a change to the MSO fee by replacing the MSO management fee with incurring part of the cost of the FIU-HCN MSO personnel as part of the expenses under the HWCOM clinics. In addition, the cost of the Centricity and PatientKeeper systems were incurred by the clinics as part of their operating expenses. In FY2017-18 the expenses for the clinics represent only those expenses aligned with its operations. In FY2017-18, FIU-HCN m a n a g e m e n t f e e b e c a m e a f l a t f e e a l i g n e d w i t h MSO tasks. In summary, after two ye ars of realignment and evolution of the MSO model, under the FIU-HCN m a n a g e m e n t n e t p a t i e n t c o l l e c t i o n s a r e increasing thus improving financial performance of the HWCOM clinical operations.

In summary the HWCOM clinics, the HWCOM international program a nd the FIU Student Health Clinics have seen positive impact to their financial performance under the management of the FIU-HCN MSO. VII. Future The Florida International University Health Care Network has be en operating as a management service organization (MSO) since July 2015. During these past thr ee yea rs, it has realigned its operations and financial structure to be in accordance with the MSO model. It has pro duced successful outcomes to its stakeholders through optimization of operations that include realignment of personnel and reporting lines, reduced expenses or subsidies, expansion of programs, increased visibility, optimization of contract negotiation, operation and financial dashboard reports and increased revenue s. As the FIU-HCN enters the next phase, it is positioned to provide MSO services across the FIU campu s to other colleges and stakeholders. The pillars to which it will operate are sustainability, profitability and growth . These three pillars are the focus for MSO and stakeholder operations. The focus on sustainability is core for its operations. It is imperative that FIU-HCN con tinues to provide its services in an efficient and effective manner while remaining n imble to change. It is committed to invest in resources that will enhance stakeholder value. A focus on profitability is inevitable for growth. FIU-HCN is ready and able to provide MSO services to new partners such as the Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing and Health Sciences (NWCNHS) for its proposed Physical Ther apy Clin ic and add services of expanded educational programs to global partners in collaboration with the Robe rt St empel College of Public of Public Health and Social Work (RSCPHSW) and with the FIU College of Business. At the HWCOM clinics, FIU-HCN will continue to focus on increas ing patient clinical revenue by increasing patient volume and expanding services such as travel medicine a nd others. Marketing efforts especially across the FIU community is a priority by increasing awareness of services, participation in FIU community events and enhancing patient experience. FIU-HCN is committed t o optimize workflows and operation efficiencies to enhance patient experience through reduced wait times for appointments and walk-ins.

Finally, it will cont inue to work closely with HWCO M clinical chairs and HWCOM Office of Clinical Affairs to implement physician reporting to enhance accountabil ity and efficiencies. FIU-HCN will present a comprehens ive plan to the Joint Governan c e C o m m i t t e e ( J G C ) o n e x p a n s i o n o f student health services and access through implementation of bi lling services at student health clinics. Online FIU students are now able to access services at student healt h services. In order to expand access to online students beyond FIU campus locations, a comprehensive plan to i mplement Telehealth services will be p r o p o s e d b y e n d o f t h i r d q u a r t e r F Y 2 0 1 8 - 2 0 1 9 . T h e a r e a o f T e l e psychiatry, an area of focus on State University System, will be a priority. Many FIU students are in cluded in their parents' insurance and currently pay out of pocket when offered services outside the health fee covered services. By implementing billing services at the student health clinics, student access may incr ease and subsequently contribute to optimize health fee covered services. Impl ementation of efficient workfl ows will be implemented upon the receipt of operation improvement study currently in progress. Pharmacy ser vices and efficiencies in this area will continue to be important. Enhanced pharmacy services throughout the campus can contribute to reduce subsidy from student health fees. Reducing subsidy will assist to use fees to expand health care services to the FIU student body. On June 2018, FIU-HCN successfully negotiated and signed on beh alf of HWCOM an extended ten-year contract with the main international partner, University of Man ipal and American University of Antigua. This partnership has now expanded from the current five-year to a te n-year commitment extending until 2028. This will enable future expansion on number of students, progra mmatic offerings, affiliations, clinical sites and FIU community partnerships. The addition of the Global MD p rogram, with student participation in FY 2019-2020, offers an opportunity to further expand current and future global partners through the coordination of opportunities for Global MD students to serve t heir clinical electives in the fourth year of medical school at the respective partner global universities. O ther potential areas for growth include simulation lab offerings and collaboration with the FIU Florida A d v a n c e d S u r g i c a l T r a n s p o r t t e a m ( F A S T ) offering disaster management certificate programs to student fr om global partners.

In addition, FIU-HCN is open to other areas of growth to fulfill its purpose of supporting the mission of the Florida International University (FIU) improve and suppo rt health education across the all units it currently serves and those that may be added in future opportun ities. 38 Page 156 of 161 This page intentionally left blank Executive Summary End of Year FY 2018 -2019 Introduction: FIU Health Care Network (FIU -HCN) ended another year with very favorable performance outcomes across all units managed . Operations continue to improve through efficie ncies in workflows across all units and more specifically in revenue cycle management. This has contributed to increase margins in net inco me for all stakeholders and for FIU -HCN management service organization ( MSO ) as compared to budget and year over year. Management has focused efforts on vendor negotiation and renegotiation to reduce losses while increasing revenue. New p rojects that are being ente rtained for FY 19 -20. A t the faculty group practice ( FGP) ACC and Broward clinics, expansion of services and providers with contin ued focus on new patient acquisition and retention by enhancing patient satisfactio n. Implementation of billing at student health clinics and telemedicine project to better serve and improve access across the entire student population. I n the international program, standardization of student educational goals across all sites and further expansion into Asia and C entral America with the addition of the international physician observer -ship program . Finally, increase collaboration across FIU campus with c olleges to provide programmatic offerings as part of the international program. Management Service Organization (MSO) : FIU-HCN has completed year four as an MSO . In this model, r evenues to FIU-HCN derive from management fees from services provided to HWCOM, O ffice of International Affairs (OIA) , Student Health Services and Embrace. Other revenue sources for FIU -HCN derive from the lease proceeds from Nicklaus Children's Hospital at the ACC ambulatory surgery center . For FY 18-19, management fees to FIU-HCN from HWCOM continue to be a flat amount capped at $250 thousand repre senting 10% of the entire clinic operations managed by FIU-HCN . Management fees from international programs to FIU -HCN include monthly contractual management fee from the FM1/IM1 program, certificate program , and electives paid by AUA directly to FIU-HCN and 15% of the programmatic fee of all other international programs paid by HWCOM . Management fee revenue to FIU -HCN from Student Health Services are 10% of contractual student health fees and fee for service revenues. Financial: At the end of the FY 17 -18, FIU -HCN en ded with a cash position of $ 8.3M up by approximately $2.3M as compared to the end of FY 1 7-18 . Accounts receivables as of the end of the r eported period decreased by $480 thousand driven by be tter efficient workflow of turn around in payments from AUA. Working capital changed from $3.54M in prior fiscal year to $ 4.96M in current fiscal year driven by HCN -MSO line of business. Overall revenues for FIU -HCN MSO ended at $ 3.4M, $441 thousand exceeding budget. Management fees der ive from 7% from management of the HWCOM clinics; 59% from the management of the internat ional program; and 17% from the management of the student health clinics. Other revenues include 15% from leases and 1% from management of the Embrace program . The positive variance in the management fee is related to the new renegotiated agreement by FIU-HCN management with i nternational partners.

The mai n goals of this plan are to improve efficiency, access to care and improve overall health outcomes in our student population. The task force committee continues to work successfully on the model . The HCN management and student health clinic staff embarked on a process improvement v alue analysis project.

Key outcome goals are one of access, increase student/patient satisfaction and enhanced quality of care. Pharmacy operations and workflows contin ue to improve. Revenues were up by 2%. A comprehensive analysis of prescription preferences and inv entory is now best reported with adequate data for decisi on-making. The next phase is review of payer negotiations and contracting.

In this fiscal year 19-20, two important projects will be launched. First is the billing project at student health clinic. A comprehensive analysis of billing processes has been completed to show the impact on operations. The analysis will be shared at the joint governance committee prior to launching the plan.
