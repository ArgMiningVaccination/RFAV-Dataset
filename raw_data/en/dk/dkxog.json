MHTC (Malaysia Health and Travel Council) states, Penang's healthcare system in 2017 alone generated RM 500 million (US$ 165 million) in revenue. Class and affordability - Penang's competitive edge in Medical tourism: Malaysia is going almost neck-to-neck in competition with Singapore and Thailand who have already made a mark in medical tourism two decades ago. Sherene Ali, the CEO of MHTC attributes the country's fast-paced medical tourism growth primarily to the affordability factor. While healthcare costs have shot up significantly in the neighboring countries, Malaysia strengthened its position by offering more [affordable prices](https://drprem.com/travel/a-short-guide-to-finding-the-most-affordable-travel-package/) and effectively strategizing niche marketing. The benefits of medical tourism in Malaysia can be seen in the economic boost of the country.

Datuk Tee also mentioned that the numbers presented show the actual number of patients without including their family members and companions. The growth of Malaysian medical tourism industry has definitely helped Johor gain massive popularity worldwide. Why is Malaysia a popular choice among medical tourists? One of the major reasons, which have helped the growth of Malaysian medical tourism, is the low [cost of medical treatments](https://drprem.com/medical-tourism/a-comprehensive-look-at-medical-expenses-that-dominate-medical-tourism-budgets). By traveling to Malaysia from developed countries like US and Canada, medical tourists can save up to 65% to 70% on healthcare procedures.

Malaysia is also a very popular Asian tourist spot. Getting treatments in this country lets people travel to the popular beaches and scenic locales.

Another reason for Malaysia's popularity as a medical tourism destination is that it has maintained the quality of medical care over the years.

Medical tourists are also visiting Malaysia for [different types of treatments ](https://drprem.com/wellness/5-main-types-alternative-medicines/)ranging from cancer, medical screenings and weight loss surgeries to general, restorative and cosmetic dentistry, cardiovascular surgery and orthopedic treatments.

But Johor can still win the race by enhancing its medical care infrastructure and advertising itself as a reliable medical tourism destination. Johor has gained popularity as a medical tourism destination in the recent years by offering wide range of low cost medical services. Rebranding is the key Though Malaysia was the first to create the safe 'Green-bubble', the country still had to face the economic downturn due to Covid-19. The way out of this situation could be [rebranding](https://drprem.com/medical-tourism/medical-tourism-training-courses) the medical tourism of the country, focusing on domestic medical tourists rather than international. International travel is still tricky, and it will take some time to return to normalcy. Stakeholders in the Malaysian healthcare catering to medical tourism are looking at the domestic healthcare market. This market has never been strategised properly, according to Professor Dr. S. Mostafa Rasoolimanesh, the Associate Professor and Director at CRiT (Taylor's University's Centre for Research and Innovation in Tourism.

Dr Mohd. Raziff Jamaluddin President of the Tourism Educators Association of Malaysia, also spoke that domestic tourism focusing on healthcare could help revive the sector, though the spending is only 4.2% on wellness and medical activities currently, per trip. Medical tourism companies in Malaysia have to repackage and rebrand their products to appeal to the middle-income group being the group that spends the most in Malaysia. The products have to meet the requirements of this group. Reviving medical tourism from the doom - How Malaysia is showing the way? The MHTC is trying all sorts of innovations to help medical tourism to rebound from the pandemic, the sooner and faster.
