Instructions for Storage and Use of Homeopathic Remedies Don't expose homeopathic medicines to substances which have strong odors, such as camphor, menthol, peppermint or other aromatic products such as Tiger Balm, Ben Gay, Noxema, etc. Don't expose the medicine to direct sunlight. Keep the container in a dark, dry, odor -free place while not in use. Don't take homeopathic preparations within 30 minutes of brushing teeth, or consuming food or dr ink. Don't handle the contents of the container. Handling the Medication Properly When using pellets or tablets, carefully roll the prescribed number of pellets into the cap of the bottle without actually touching the medication with your hands. Then, drop the dose under your tongue and allow the pellets to dissolve there. (Sometimes it's difficult to persuade small children to keep the pellets under their tongues - in the mouth is good enough!) When using drops, squeeze the prescribed number of drops on or under your tongue without touching the dropper to your mouth. Drops may be diluted with water if desired. If you have any questions regarding the use of this product, please contact your physician. "}
