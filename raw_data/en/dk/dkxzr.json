This systematic review w as conducted as part of the Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months (P/B -24) Project by USDA's Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team . The purpose of the P/B -24 Project was to conduct a series of systematic reviews on diet and health for women who are pregnant and for infants and toddlers from birth to 24 months of age. This project was a joint initiati ve led by USDA and HHS, and NESR carried out all of the systematic reviews. A Federal Expert Group (FEG), a broadly representative group of Federal researchers and program leaders , also provided input throughout the P/B -24 Proj ect. More information about the P/B -24 Project has been published2 and is available on the NESR website: https://nesr.usda.gov/project -specific - overview -pb-24-0. NESR, formerly known as the Nutrition Evidence Library (NEL), specializes in conducting food- and nutrition- related systematic reviews using a rigorous , protocol -driven methodology . To conduct each P/B-24 systematic review, NESR's staff worked with a Technical Expert Collaborative (TEC) , which is a group of 7- 8 leading subject matter experts . NESR's systematic review methodology involves developing and prioritizing systematic r eview questions , searching for and s elect ing s tudies , extracting and assessing the risk of bias of data from each included study , synthesizing the evidence, developing a conclusion statement, grading the evidence underlying the conclusion statement, and recommending future research. A detailed description of the methodology used in c onducting systematic reviews for the P/B -24 Project has been published3 and is available on the NESR website : https://nesr.usda.gov/pb- 24-project - methodology -0. In addition, starting on page 38, this document includes details about the methodology as it was applied to the systematic review described herein. An analytic framework that illustrates the overall scope of the question, including the population, the interventions and/or exposures, comparators, and outcomes of interest , is found on page 38. In addition, the literature search plan that was used to identify studies included in this systematic review is found on page 38 . 2 Stoody EE, Spahn JM, Casavale KO.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY What is the question? The question is: What is the relationship between shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and food allergies, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, a nd asthma? What is the answer to the question? Moderate evidence mostly from observational studies suggests that , among infants fed human milk, shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding are associated with higher risk of asthma in childhood and adolescence. Limited evidence does not suggest a relationship between the duration of any human milk feeding and allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis in childhood. Evidence about the relationship between shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and atopic dermatitis from birth to 24 months is inconclusive, and t here is insufficien t evidence to determine the relationship of shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding with f ood al lergies throughout the lifespan; allergic rhinitis from birth to 24 months, in adolescence, or in adulthood; asthma in adulthood; and atopic dermatitis in adolescence or in adulthood. Why was this question asked? This important public health question was identified and prioritized as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project. How was this question answered? A team of Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review staff conducted a systematic review in collaboration with a group of experts called a Technical Expert Collaborative. What is the population of interest? The population of interest was generally healthy infants and toddlers (ages 0-24 months ) who were in studies examining food allergies, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis throughout the lifespan and asthma from childhood through adulthood (ages 2 years and up). What evidence was found? This review includes 35 articles . These articles compared infants fed human milk for shorter durations with infants fed human milk for longer durations . The infants could be fed any amount of human milk . These articles examined available evidence related to food allergies, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma. Most of the evidence examined allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma through childhood. 8 o Children and adolescents who were fed human milk for sh orter durations may have higher risk of asthma than children and adolescents who were fed human milk for longer durations . o Children who were fed human milk for shorter durations and children who were fed human milk for longer durations do not seem to have different risk of allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis . There are limitations in the evidence as follows: o There was not a lot of evidence about food allergies . o There was not a lot of evidence in adolescents or adults . o Some studies did not use s trong methods to collect infant feeding data or measure outcomes . o It is possible for factors other than infant feeding to impact the observed outcomes, and these factors were addressed differently by different studies . o Some of the articles studied groups of children that may have been too small to detect whether there is a relationship between shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and the outcomes . o Atopic disease may impact the duration of any human milk feeding, because parents may decide, or receive medical advice, to continue or discontinue feeding human milk based on infants' symptoms or because of a history of atopic disease in parents or older siblings . How up -to-date is this review? This review includes literature from 01/1980 to 03/2016. 9 TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background This systematic review was conducted as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project. The goal of this systematic review was to examine the following question: What is the relationship between shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and food allergies, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, a nd asthma? This systematic revie w examines comparisons of infants who were fed human milk for shorter durations with infants who were fed human milk for longer durations . Human milk feeding was defined as feeding human milk alone or in combination with infant formula and/or complementary foods or beverages such as cow's milk. Human milk was defined as mother's own milk provided at the breast (i.e., nursing) or expressed and fed fresh or after refrigeration or freezing. Donor milk (e.g., banked milk) was not examined in this review. This systematic review examines available evidence related to food allergies, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis from birth through adulthood and asthma from childhood through adulthood (outcomes prior to childhood may represent transient recurrent wheeze4). Conclusion statement and grade Moderate evidence mostly from observational studies suggests that , among infants fed human milk, shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding are associated with higher risk of asthma in childhood and adolescence. Limited evidence does not suggest a relationship between the duration of any human milk feeding and allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis in childhood. Evidenc e about the relationship between shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and atopic dermatitis from birth to 24 months is inconclusive, and t here is insufficient evidence to determine the relationship of shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding with f ood al lergies throughout the lifespan; allergic rhinitis from birth to 24 months, in adolescence, or in adulthood; asthma in adulthood; and atopic dermatitis in adolescence or in adulthood. Grade: Moderate - asthma in childhood and adolescence; Limited - allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis in childhood; Grade Not Assignable - food allergies throughout the lifespan, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis outside of childhood, asthma in adulthood Methods The systematic r eview was conducted by a team of staff from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review in collaboration with a Technical Expert Collaborative. 4 Stein RT, Holberg CJ, Morgan WJ, Wright AL, Lombardi E, Taussig L, Martinez FD. Peak flow variability, methacholine responsiveness and atopy as markers for detecting different wheezing phenotypes in childhood. Thorax 1997;52(11):946- 52. 10 A single literature search was conducted to identify literature for several related systematic reviews that examined infant milk -feeding practices and different outcomes . The search was conducted in CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, and PubMed, and used a search date range of January 1980 to March 2016. A manual search was done to identify articles that may not have been included in the electronic databases searched. Articles were screened independently by 2 NE SR analysts to determine which articles met predetermined criteria for inclusion. Data from eac h included article were extracted, risk s of bias w ere assessed , and both were checked for accuracy . The body of evidence was qualitatively synthesized, a conclusion statement was developed, and the strength of the evidence (grade) was assessed using pre- established criteria including evaluation of the internal validity/ risk of bias, adequacy , consistency, impact, and generalizability of available evidence. Summary of evidence Thirty -five art icles met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review, including 3 with evidence about food allergies, 7 with evidence about allergic rhinitis, 15 with evidence about atopic dermatitis, and 23 with evidence about asthma. Almost all of the evidence was from observational studies. Evidence about the association between shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and higher risk of asthma in childhood and adolescence was moderate. Across the 20 independent studies ( 21 articles), 8 found statisti cally significant associations and, with 1 exception, they showed that shorter durations of any human milk feeding was associated with higher risk. The majority of nonsignificant associations were also consistent in suggesting higher risk of asthma in childhood and adolescence with shorter durations of any human milk feeding, and some of the inconsistency in statistical significance may be explained by insufficient statistical power. The ability to draw stronger conclusions was primarily limited by the limited statistical power in some studies and concerns about reverse causality and internal validity , such as the potential for confounding in a body of evidence primarily made up of observational studies. Evidence about the lack of an associati on between shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis in childhood was limited. Across the 5 independent studies (6 articles) that examined allergic rhinitis in children, the only significant assoc iation was from a subsample analysis of African- American children, and there were no comparable analyses with which to compare the result. Likewise, across the 8 independent studies (9 articles) that examined atopic dermatitis in children, the only signifi cant associations were reported by a study with risk of multiple comparison bias. The ability to draw stronger conclusions was primarily limited by the small number of studies, limited statistical power in some studies, concerns with generalizability of the samples to diverse U.S. populations, and concern about the potential for confounding. Evidence about atopic dermatitis from birth to 24 months was inconclusive. Across 8 studies, the associations were inconsistent in direction. There was also concern about the specificity of diagnosing atopic dermatitis in this age group. Evidence related to food allergies throughout the lifespan, and outcomes beyond childhood, in general, was scant. 11 FULL REVIEW Systematic review question What is the relationship between shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and food allergies, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, a nd asthma?

There was also concern about the specificity of diagnosing atopic dermatitis in this age group. Evidence related to food allergies throughout the lifespan, and outcomes beyond childhood, in general, was scant. Description of the evidence Thirty -five articles met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review question (1-35). Of these, 3 presented evidence related to food allergies (1 -3), 7 presented evidence related to allergic rhinitis (4-10), 15 presented evidence related to atopic dermatitis (2, 4, 5, 7, 10 -12, 18, 29- 35), and 23 presented evidence related to asthma (5, 7-28) (some articles presented evidence for more than 1 outcome) . Food allergies Three articles presented evidence about the relationship between shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and food allergies (Table 1). One nested case- control study (1) and 1 prospective cohort study (2) presented outcomes from birth to 24 months, 1 prospective cohort study presented outcomes in childhood (3) , and no studies examined outcomes in adolescence or adulthood. The studies were from the US (3) , UK (1) , and Sweden (2). Participants were newborn at baseline. The US study included some ethnic diversity but the other studies did not report race/ethnicity. Participants in two of the studies were at risk for allergic disease (based on parent history of allergy) (2) or type 1 diabetes (based on genotype or family history) (3). The durat ion of any human milk feeding was collected prospectively by parent report and assessed as a continuous variable. The outcomes were food allergy by 18 months (2) and 2 years (1) of age and 13 wheat allergy by 4 years of age (3). Only 1 of the studies controlled for confounding variables (3) . Allergic rhinitis Seven articles presented evidence about the relationship between shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and allergic rhinitis (Table 2). No studies examined outcomes in adolescence or adulthood. One article (4) examined outcomes from birth to 24 months . It presented evidence from a Swedish birth cohort. Data about the duration of any human milk feeding were collected prospectively by parent report and assessed as a categorical variable ( 6 months vs < 6 months ). The outcome was incidence of suspected allergic rhinitis by age 2 years, based on parent report of either symptoms or a doctor's diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. The analysis included important adjustment variables. Six articles pres ented outcomes in childhood (5-10). Kramer et al. (5) presented evidence from the Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial (PROBIT) , a cluster randomi zed controlled trial of an intervention to promote prolonged duration and exclusivity of human milk feeding among mothers who chose to feed human milk. Study pediatricians collected human milk -feeding data at well-baby medical appointments , and the intervention group had higher rates of human milk feeding than the control group measured at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The outcomes, ever having hay fever symptoms or having hay fever symptoms in the previous 12 months, were assessed by study pediatricians using th e validated instrument from the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood (ISAAC)6. There were also 4 prospective cohort studies that presented evidence across 5 articles (6-10) (unique evidence from the Dampness in Buildings and Health (DBH) s tudy was presented by Larsson et al. (7) and von Kobyletzki et al. (8)). Two of the studies examined high- risk cohorts (based on family history of allergic disease) (6, 10) , and a third study examined children who were at risk for type 1 diabetes (9). Data about the duration of human milk feeding were collected by parent questionnaire and assessed as a continuous variable by Codispoti et al. (6) and as heterogeneous categorical variables by the other studies (7 -10). Allergic rhinitis was defined based on parent responses to items from the ISAAC questionnaire (6 -9), parent report of physician diagnosis (7) , or positive skin prick test or allergen- specific IgE level 0.7 kU/l plus a history of symptoms (10). The comparisons of interest in 2 studies were unadjusted (7 -9), and the remaining studies considered a range of confounders (6, 10) . Atopic dermatitis Fifteen articles (2, 4, 5, 7, 10- 12, 18, 29- 35) presented evidence about the relationship between shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and atopic dermatitis. Eight articles presented evidence from birth to 24 months (2, 4, 10, 18, 29- 32) (Table 3), 9 articles presented evidence in childhood (5, 7, 10- 12, 18, 33- 35), and no articles presented outcomes in adolescence or adulthood (some articles presented evidence in more than one age group). Birth to 24 months The 8 articles that examined shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and 6 International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood. Version 5 April 2017. Internet: https://www.cancer.gov/types/leukemia/hp/child- all-treatment -pdq (accessed April 13 2018). 14 atopic dermatitis from birth to 24 months presented evidence from 1 cluster randomized controlled trial (32) , 1 nested case- control study (29) , and 6 prospective cohort studies (2, 4, 10, 18, 30, 31) (Table 3). The cluster randomized controlled trial, PROBIT, was described previously in the section about allergic rhinitis . The outcome relevant to atopic dermatitis during the birth to 24 month period, atopic eczema by 12 months, was listed as a secondary outcome of the study7 and was diagnosed by study physicians. The nested case- control study was from the Netherlands (29) and the prospective c ohort studies were from Sweden (2, 4) , Finland (10) , Japan (30) , New Zealand (31) , and there was a multinational study from Finland, France, Germany, and Switzerland (18) . All of these studies enrolled participants as newborns. Three studies specif ically recruited individuals with family history of allergic disease (2, 10, 29) . Data about human milk feeding duration were collected by parent report. The duration of any human milk feeding was assessed as a categorical variable by comparing specific ranges of duration (4, 10, 18, 30) , and as a continuous variable (29, 31) , including comparing the median duration of any human milk feeding between participants with and without atopic dermatitis (2) . Atopic dermatitis was based on clinical examination (2, 10, 18, 29) or parent report of morbidity data and/or physician diagnosis (4, 18, 30, 31) , and was measured from birth to 6 months (2), 15 months (31) , 18 months (2), and 2 years of age (4, 18) , and at 16 to 24 months (30) , and 2 years of age (10) . Kerkhof et al. (29) reported the expected probability of atopic dermatitis at 12 months. The studies varied in their selection and treatment of confounding variables. The comparisons of interest in 2 studies (2, 29) were unadjusted; however, the remaining studies considered a range of confounders. Childhood The 9 articles that examined shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and atopic dermatitis in childhood presented evidenc e from 1 cluster randomized controlled trial (5) , 6 prospective cohort studies that presented evidence ac ross 7 articles (7, 10- 12, 18, 33, 34) [Bergmann et al. (11, 33) presented evidence from the Multicentre Allergy Study across 2 articles] and 1 nested case- control study (35) (Table 4) . The cluster randomized controlled trial, PROBIT, was described previously in the section about allergic rhinitis. The outcome relevant to atopic derm atitis during childhood, eczema by 6.5 years, was listed as a secondary outcome of the study8 and was diagnosed by study physicians using the ISAAC instrument. Across the prospective cohort and nested case- control studies , data about human milk feeding were collected by parent report. The duration of human milk feeding was assessed as a continuous variable (12, 33- 35) and heterogeneous categorical variables (7, 10, 11, 18, 33, 35) . Atopic dermatitis was defined based on parent responses to items from the ISAAC questionnaire (7, 35) ; by parent report of a physician's diagnosis or a positive SCORring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score (18); and by physical examination plus parent -reported case history (11, 12, 33), a positive skin prick test on at least 1 occasion (10, 34) or an allergen- specific IgE level 0.7kU/l (10). Bergmann et al. (11, 33) , Sandini et al. (10) , and Kusel et al. (34) specifically recruited high- risk or \"risk- enriched\" samples based on family history of allergic disease and/or 7 U.S. National Library of Medicine. Clinicaltrials.gov.

(35) , Larsson et al. (7) and Kusel et al. (34) were unadjusted, whereas the remaining studies considered a range of confounders. Asthma Twenty -three articles (5, 7 -28) presented evidence about the relationship between shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and asthma. Two prospective cohort studies presented evidence in adults from Brazil (27) and G ermany (28) (Table 6). Partic ipants were newborn at baseline. Data about the duration of any human milk feeding duration was collected prospectively by parent report, and the studies compared categorical ranges of duration. The Brazilian study examined asthma at 18 years of age in a male- only subsample of the Pelotas Birth Cohort (27). The German study examined a \"risk -enriched\" sample based on family history of allergic disease or IgE l evels and assessed asthma by 20 years of age (28). Outcomes were based on responses to validated ISAAC questionnaire items about symptoms, medication use, and physician diagnosis. Both studies includ ed important adjustment variables. Childhood and adolescence Almost all of the articles examined asthma in children and adolescents (5, 7-26) (Table 5). These articles presented evidence from 1 experimental study and 19 independent observational studies (Larsson et al. (7) and von Kobyletzki et al. (8) presented unique evidence from the same study) . The experimental study, PROBIT (5), was described previously in the section about allergic rhinitis . The outcome relevant to childhood asthma, ever having asthma by 6.5 years, was a secondary outcome of the study9 assessed by study pediatricians using the ISAAC instrument . The observational studies included 2 case- control studies from Kuwait (23) and Sri Lanka (14) and 17 independent prospective cohort studies from the US (15, 24) , Sweden (7, 8, 16, 19, 20) , Finland (9, 10, 25) , Norway (26) , Denmark (12), Germany (11) , the UK (13) , Brazil (22), Australia (17), New Zealand (21), and a multinational study from Finland, France, Germany, and Switzerland (18). The case- control studies sampled participants who were 1 to 10 (14) and 8 to 15 (23) years of age at the time of the study. With a few exceptions (7, 8, 19, 20, 25) , the prospective cohorts followed participants from birth . A minority of articles reported race or ethnicity ; the U.S. samples were mostly Non- Hispanic white (24) and \"primarily Caucasian\" (15) , and the studies in Australia and New Zealand reported that the samples were 2.5% Aboriginal descent (17) and 14.6% Maori (21) , respectively . A few studies recruited high- risk or \"risk- enriched\" samples based on IgE levels (11), a family history of allergic disease (10, 11, 15) , or having had respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis in infancy (20) . One study (9) recruited a sample with high risk for type 1 diabetes. Data about human milk feeding were collected by parent report . Asthma outcomes were based on physician diagnosis (7, 12- 14, 20, 23) , medical record (10, 15) or parent report of morbidity data and/or physician diagnosis (7 -9, 15, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24- 26). The studies varied in their selection and treatment of confounding variables ; with the exception of 1 study (15), the studies considered a range of confounders .

Internet: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01561612#wrapper (accessed February 16, 2018). 16 The available evidence was insufficient to determine the relationship between shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and food allergies throughout the l ifespan (Table 1). There were only 2 studies of outcomes from birth to 24 months (1, 2 ), 1 study of outcomes in childhood (3), and no studies of outcomes in adolescence or adulthood. This small number of studies examined both food allergy (1, 2) and wheat allergy (3) , and included heterogeneou s samples with regard to their risk for both allergic disease and type 1 diabetes. The studies also had limited methodological rigor; for example, only one study controlled for confounding variables (3). Table 1.

There was only 1 study of outcomes from birth to 24 months (4) and no studies of outcomes in adolescence or adulthood. Limited evidence did not suggest a relationship between the duration of any human milk feeding and allergic rhinitis in childhood. The only experimental study, the PROBIT study, found no association between group status (the intervention group had higher rates of human milk feeding than the control group measured at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) and ever having hay fever symptoms or having hay fever symptoms in the previous 12 months, both measured at age 6.5 years (5) . Nearly all of the associations across the 4 prospective cohort studies were also nonsignifi cant, with no discernable trend in the direction of the point estimates. The only statistically significant association was by Codispoti et al. (6) , which found that a longer duration of human milk feeding was associated with lower risk of allergic rhinitis in African Am erican 3- year-olds (OR: 0.8; 95% CI: 0.6, 0.9). There were no comparable analyses in other studies in this body of evidence that would allow TEC members to examine whether this association is typical among African American children. There are limitations to the adequacy, generalizability, and internal validity of the evidence in childhood. With regard to adequacy, there were only 5 independent studies and 1 sample may have been too small to have sufficient statistical power for the comparison of interest because the nonsignificant association had a wide confidence interval (10) . Regarding generalizability, although all of the studies were conducted in countries listed as high or very high on the 2014 Human Development Index10, there was only 1 study from the US (6) and its sample was mostly white. The non- US samples did not report race/ethnicity. In addition, 1 study had participants with high risk for type 1 diabetes (9) and the comparison of interest for this systematic review was not adjusted for any type 1 diabetes risk -related variables . Confounding is possible because infant - feeding decisions can be strongly socially patterned; differences between feeding groups were only mitigated by randomization in the PROBIT study (5) and 2 of the observational studies did not address confounding variables in the analyses of interest (7-9). In addition, the DBH study may have been prone to attrition bias because there was high attrition (7, 8) that was differential with regard to 3 critical confounders: socioeconomic status, smoking, and family design. 10 United Nations Development Programme.

The evidence from birth to 24 months was inconclusive, as described below, and no articles presented outcomes in adolescence or adulthood. Birth to 24 months Eight articles presented inconclusive evidence on shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and atopic dermatitis from birth to 24 months (2, 4, 10, 18, 29- 32) (Table 3). Kramer et al. (32) provided compelling evidence from the PROBIT study (a cluster randomized controlled trial) that the experimental group had lower risk of atopic dermatitis at 12 months of age than the control group (OR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.95). Yet, evidence from 7 observational studies (2, 4, 10, 18, 29- 31) was inconsistent with evidence from the PROBIT study. Miyake et al. (30) found that feeding human milk 6 months, in comparison to <6 months, was associated with significantly higher odds of atopic dermatitis in the absence of parental atopic history (OR: 3.39; 95% CI: 1.20, 12.36), and evidence from the remaining studies lacked statistic al significance and had point estimates that were inconsistent in direction. Furthermore, TEC members had concerns about reverse causality and the specificity of detecting atopic dermatitis during the birth to 24 month period. Childhood The available evid ence does not suggest a relationship between shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and atopic dermatitis in childhood ( Table 4). The PROBIT study (a cluster randomized controlled trial ) (5) found no association between group status and ever having eczema by 6.5 years . Likewise, m ost of the associations between the duration of any human milk feeding and atopic dermatitis in childhood across the observational studies were nonsignificant . Only Bergmann et al. (33) found a positive association between the duration of any human milk feeding (assessed as a continuous variable) and atopic eczema through 7 years of age (OR: 1.029; 95% CI: 1.002, 1.057) and between being fed human milk 2 months, in comparison to <2 mont hs, and higher odds of atopic eczema through years of age (OR: 1.384; 95% CI: 1.025, 1.869). However, the significant associations were limited to 1 (33) of 2 arti cles (11, 33) with data from the M ulticentre Allergy Study , and to 2 of the 10 relevant analyses in the article. There are limitations to the adequacy, generalizability, and internal validity of the evidence. With regard to adequacy, t here were only 8 independent studies (with evidence across 9 articles) and the samples in 4 of the studies (5, 10, 11, 18) may have been too small to have sufficient statistical power to examine the comparisons of interest for this systematic review, as they had wide confidence intervals around their nonsignificant associations . Regarding general izability, although all of the studies were conducted in countries listed as high or very high on the 2014 Human Development Index11, no studies were conducted in the US or reported race/ethnicity . Confounding is possible because infant -feeding decisions can be strongly socially patterned; differences between feeding groups were only mitigated by randomization in the PROBIT study (5) and 3 of the observational studies did not address confounding variables in the analyses of interest (7, 34, 35) . In addition, some studies may have prone to attrition bias due to high and/or 11 United Nations Development Programme. Human Development Report 2014.

There w ere only 2 studies (27, 28) , generalizability was limited becaus e one study exam ined asthma in male participants, only (27) , and t here was high attrition. Childhood and adolescence Across the studies that examined asthma in childhood and adolescence (5, 7-26) (Table 5), statistically significant associations were reported by 6 prospective cohort studies (7, 9, 16, 21, 24, 26) and both case- control studies (14, 23) . With 1 exception (24) , these studies found inverse association s between the duration of any human milk feeding and asthma risk in children and adolescents, and suggested that the predominant difference between the statistically signific ant and nonsignificant associations was statistical power. Specifically, in the study by Hovland et al. (26) a larger proportion of the participants who never had asthma (N=322) were fed human milk >4 months than participants who had asthma. However, the difference was only significant with the subsample of participants with asthma in remission during puberty [10 to 16 years of age (OR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.65)], and not in the subsamples w ith asthma during puberty. Kull et al. (16) examined shorter versus longer durations of exclusive plus add itional partial human milk feeding. Being fed human milk 3 months after 3 to 4 months of exclusive human milk feeding, and being fed human milk 5 months after 3 months of exclusive human milk 26 feeding (i.e., longer durations), in comparison to being fed human milk 0 to 2 months after to 0 to 2 months of exclusive human milk feeding (i.e., a shorter duration) were associated with lower odds of asthma at 4 years of age The nonsignificant associations were in the same direction but had wider confidence intervals indicative of suboptimal statistical power. In the DBH study, Larsson et al. (7) and von Kobyletzki et al. (8) examined the 5- year cumulative incidence of asthma by 6 to 7 (8) and 6 to 9 (7) years of age in a sample of children who did not have asthma at baseline, and in subsamples of children who did (7) and did not (7, 8) have wheezing at baseline. In the subsample of children with wheezing at baseline, Larsson et al. (7) found higher odds of asthma in children fed human milk <3 months and 3 to 6 months in comparison to >6 months (OR: 1.09, 3.11, respectively). In analyses of the full sample and the subsample with no wheezing at baseline, the nonsignificant associations were in the same direction and had wide confidence intervals indicative a lack of statistical power (7, 8) . In a sample with high risk for type 1 diabetes, Nwaru et al. (9) found higher hazard ratios among children fed human milk <5 months and 5 to 9.5 months in comparison to >9.5 months respectively ). Silvers et al. (21) examined the duration of any human milk feedi ng as a continuous variable and found lower odds of asthma at 3 and 4 years of age as the number of months of human milk feeding increased (OR: 0.92, 0.99, respectively). At 5 years of age the upper limit of t he confidence interval was 1.00, and at 6 years of age the confidence interval included the null. Colen et al. (24) conducted the only prospective cohort study with a statistically significant association that showed that a longer versus shorter duration of any human milk feeding was associated with a higher risk of asthma. It examined asthma from 4 to 14 years using a between- family estimate from the full sample as well as a within- family estimate from a subsample of sibling participants. In the full sample, each additional week of feeding human milk tended to increase asthma; however, the effect size was small (: 0.00 4; SE: 0.002; p<0.05) and a nonsignificant and similarly small effect size was found in the sibling subsample analysis. Statistically significant associations were also reported by both case- control studies (14, 23) , which provided additional evidence of an inverse association between the duration of any human milk feeding and asthma risk in children and adolescents. Karunasekera et al. (14) reported that being fed human milk 6 months versus >6 months was associated with higher odds of asthma at 1 to 10 years of age (OR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2, 3.2), and Al -Mousawi et al. (23) reported that being fed human milk >2 months versus <2 months was associated with lower odds of asthma at 8 to 15 years of age (OR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.96). The nonsignificant associations provided further evidence of an inverse relationship between the duration of any human milk feeding and asthma because they were consistent in direction with the significant associations (7, 8, 10- 13, 16, 17, 20- 22, 26) and some of the non- significance was explainable due to inadequate power. The minority of studies had nonsignificant associations that were discrepant (5, 18, 19, 25) or did not report point estimates so direction could not be assessed (15). The evidence related to shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and asthma in childhood and adolescence was graded moderate after considering the adequacy, consistency, impact, generalizability, and internal validity of the evidence. Twenty independent studies 27 examined the duration of any human milk feeding and asthma in children and adolescents and, with 1 exception (24) , the statistically significant associations showed that shorter versus longer durations associate with higher risk of asthma (7, 9, 14, 16, 21, 23, 26) . The majority of nonsignificant associations were also consistent in suggesting higher risk with shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding, and some of the inconsistency in statistical significance may be explained by insufficient statistical power resulting in wide confidence intervals. Evidence was consistent despite heterogeneous independent variables resulting from not defining shorter or longer for the systematic review, and instead including all relevant comparisons. However, the consistency was limited to observational studies because the single experimental study had a nonsignificant association (5). In the NE SR grading rubric, the impact of the evidence takes into consideration the directness with which the study designs examined the link between the exposure and outcome of interest in the systematic review question, and the clinical significance of the evidence. Although some studies' original objectives were not explicitly stated, most studies described objectives related to examining the link between feeding human milk and asthma; 6 studies were indirect (7-10, 17, 20, 22) . Regarding clinical significance, asthma affects the quality of life for millions of children in the U.S. and can be life- threatening; therefore, even small decreases in the risk for asthma have the potential to be of public health importance. The generalizability of the evidence to U.S. populations had a few limitations, but was sound overall. There were 2 U.S. studies of shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and asthma in childhood and adolescence; however, they lacked racial and ethnic diversity. In addition, 1 sample was high- risk for type 1 diabetes and the evidence of interest for this systematic review did not include any corresponding model adjustments (9) . The samples were from countries that were high or very high on t he 2014 Human Development Index12 and therefore had a level of human development likely generalizable to the U.S. There were some concerns about internal validity. Infant milk -feeding research can be prone to detection bias because infant milk -feeding data are often collected using parent reporting methods that may not be valid and reliable; however, most studies collected these data prospectively, which reduces recall bias. Confounding can arise because differences between feeding groups are rarely mitigat ed by randomization (due to ethical issues around allocating infants to be fed no human milk) and infant -feeding decisions can be strongly socially patterned. However, most studies adjusted for confounding variables deemed important and feasible to control , although the specific adjustment variables varied between studies. Reverse causation can be a major concern because parents may decide, or receive medical advice, to continue or discontinue feeding human milk based on infants' symptoms and because atopic disease in parents or older siblings may influence parents' feeding decisions as they try to prevent asthma. However, the majority of studies found no baseline differences in family history of atopic disease between groups or included family history of at opic disease as an adjustment variable (5, 7-11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20- 23, 25, 26) . Attrition bias, due to high attrition, differential attrition, or both, may have existed among some of the studies in the body of evidenc e (7, 8, 11, 12, 17, 24- 26); however, these studies were not more concentrated among the st udies with significant versus nonsignificant associations. 12 United Nations Development Programme.

In addition, it would be beneficial to have more research with representative U.S. samples to confirm current evidence . We propose that researchers study the duration of human milk feeding among infants fed human milk (i.e., assess infants who were never fed human milk separately from humans who were fed human milk). Infant -feeding research will continue to rely on observational designs , because of ethical issues related to randomizing infant to be fed less or no human milk ; however, researchers should endeavor to minimize bias through sound research design and conduct. In general, i nfant -feeding researchers should: 35 Move toward collecting data consistently using valid and reliable methods Increase the precision with which they define infant -feeding variables Incorporate effect modification into their study design whenever possible i n case different biological or environmental characteristics modify the impact of infant feeding on the outcomes Assess baseline differences in critical confounding variables between comparison groups, and make statistical adjustments as necessary Address temporality and reverse causality when outcomes are measured from birth to 24 months 36 Included articles 1.

The results of the electronic database searches were screened independently by two NESR analysts in a step- wise manner by reviewing titles and abstracts, and then full text articles to determine which articles met the criteria for inclusion. A manual search was done to ascertain articles not identified through the electronic database search. The systematic revi ew on shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding and food allergies, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma included 35 articles . 45 Table 8.
