Such regulatory agility and flexibility allow for speedier development and evaluation. Some companies have also leveraged international clinical trial networks to select trial sites with high infection rate, enabling rapid enrolment into the trials. | | HSA's Review & Evaluation | | For routine vaccine registration purposes, the manufacturer will need to make an application to HSA to register the products with the complete pre-clinical, clinical and manufacturing data to substantiate the quality, safety and efficacy of the products at the point of application and demonstrate that the benefits outweigh the known risks for use in our population. | | Under PSAR, companies can submit data on a \"rolling\", or staggered basis and continue their clinical trials and development while HSA reviews the submitted data concurrently, instead of waiting for the full data set to be submitted before starting evaluation. Hence, evaluation can potentially be completed in a shorter time, by working expeditiously on the available rolling data. As with other new vaccines undergoing routine registration, data submitted by companies under PSAR will be robustly and thoroughly reviewed by HSA's regulators, in accordance with international scientific standards during the evaluation. Although companies can start submitting data from the early development stages, HSA will only grant PSAR authorisation if there is reasonable quality, safety and efficacy data suggesting that the potential benefits outweigh the known risks. HSA also consults with and presents our assessment and recommendations to our Medicines Advisory Committee and Panel of Infectious Diseases Experts before granting any interim authorisation. Ongoing data must continue to be submitted post-authorisation to transition the status of the vaccine from PSAR interim authorisation to full registration. | | Vaccine Safety Monitoring | | Following regulatory approval and registration of a vaccine, HSA's post market surveillance programme allows for the continual monitoring of the safety profile to ensure that the benefit continues to outweigh the known risks after the vaccine has been in use in wider clinical setting. | | In addition to the existing pharmacovigilance system that is already in place, HSA will actively monitor the safety profiles of the COVID-19 vaccine and use data analytics to detect safety signals. This will enable HSA to take swift regulatory actions should any safety concern emerge. "}
