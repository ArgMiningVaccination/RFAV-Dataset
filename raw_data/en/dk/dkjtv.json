Although herbs are natural, they are not always safe. Taking the wrong dose or combination, or using the wrong part of the plant, may cause side effects or be poisonous (toxic). Serious side effects include damage to the liver or kidneys. Some Ayurvedic and Chinese products have been shown to contain lead, mercury and arsenic in high enough quantities to be considered toxic. Other herbal preparations have been found to contain pesticides and prescription medicines. Learn more about: Using herbal products safely There are things you can do to use herbal products safely: - Buy herbal products from a qualified therapist or reputable supplier. - If your therapist is making up a preparation for you, ask for it to be clearly labelled in English with your name, date, quantity, ingredients, dosage, directions, safety information (if applicable) and your therapist's contact details. - Avoid buying over-the-counter products online. Products from other countries that are available over the internet [are not covered by the same quality and safety regulations as those sold in Australia](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/safety-concerns/regulation-of-medicines/), and may not include the ingredients listed on the label. - Make sure you know how to prepare and take your herbs. Like conventional medicine, taking the correct dose at the right time is important for the safe use of herbal remedies. - Check the label for any warnings about side effects and drug interactions. Talk to your doctor and complementary therapist about possible side effects and what you should do if you experience them. - Report any suspected adverse reactions to any kind of medicine to your therapist or doctor. If the reaction is serious, call Triple Zero (000) or go to your nearest emergency department.
