Between 10 and 20% of women develop a mental health problem during pregnancy or within the first year after hav ing a baby. Perinatal mental health problems are an important cause of ma ternal mortality and if untreated may not resolve for a long time an d can have a devastating impact on both women and their families . Mental disorders in the perinatal period include an tenatal and postnatal depression, anxiety disorders including obsessive c ompulsive disorder and panic disorder, eating disorders, post-traumati c stress disorder, relapse of known severe mental illnesses including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and bipolar affective diso rder and postpartum psychosis. These conditions may develop insidiously or extremely suddenly during pregnancy and post-delivery. Post-p artum psychosis and severe affective illnesses are particularly lik ely to occur close to delivery and are severe and sudden in their present ation, constituting a medical emergency. Perinatal mental health problems range from mild to extremely severe, requiring different pathways, management and care. However, if individuals prone to relapse and those who do develop an illness are identified early, it is poss ible to promote recovery in a timely way and mitigate many of the negative e ffects of perinatal mental health problems for women, their infants and their families. The perinatal mental health care pathway in this do cument has been developed by senior practitioners within perinatal mental health services in London and sets out guidance on the key components required to develop and deliver perinatal mental he alth services that meet the needs of women and their families. It is c oncordant with NICE guidance (NICE APMH 2014) and the Perinatal Quality Network (PQN/CCQI) service standards. PERINATAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE PATHWAYS London Perinatal Mental Health Network 2015 5 The key to successful implementation of this pathwa y lies in the close integration of community perinatal mental health se rvices and maternity provider based obstetric and midwifery leads. Given the complex geography of London, commissioners will play an imp ortant role in configuring these services and ensuring seamless in tegration. The London mental health and maternity clinical str ategic networks are very pleased to be able to endorse this care pathwa y. This pathway is an important tool that will support commissioners t o improve perinatal care through enabling prevention, prediction, detec tion and treatment of perinatal mental health problems. Perinatal ment al health provision needs to be comprehensive, accessible, equitable an d available within a timely manner. This document sets out how this ma y be achieved to ensure that women and their families in London get the right treatment, from the right services at the right time. Matthew Patrick Co-clinical Director, London Mental Health SCN Chief Executive, South London and the Maudsley NHS Trust Nick Broughton Co-clinical Director, London Mental Health SCN Medical Director, West London Mental Health NHS Trust Professor Donald Peebles Co-clinical Director, London Maternity SCN Professor of Fetal Medicine University College London Donna Ockenden Co-clinical Director, London Maternity SCN Formerly Chief Midwife & Care Group University Director - Family Health Services South London Healthcare Trust PERINATAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE PATHWAYS London Perinatal Mental Health Network 2015 6 INTRODUCTORY NOTES AND THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK The Pan London Perinatal Mental Health Network The Pan London Perinatal Mental Health Network was formed in 2013. It is a multidisciplinary network accountable to th e Clinical Director of the London Mental Health Strategic Clinical Network (SCN). It oversees the North West, North East and South Londo n Perinatal Mental Health Clinical Networks, which each have a chair and a co- chair. The following initial priorities were set for the N etwork in 2013: To develop standardised Perinatal Mental Health Tr aining for London To develop a Pan London MBU Admission Protocol To develop a London Perinatal Mental Health Care P athway & standard protocols To undertake a Pan London Perinatal Mental Health Needs Assessment To develop a London Perinatal information sharing 'Electronic Hub' Consultation process and pathway development The present document is the result of an extensive consultation exercise over a period of two years involving a wid e range of stakeholders across maternity, health visiting, soc ial care, psychology, psychotherapy, psychiatry, the third se ctor and service users. The views, opinions and experiences of the stake holders were collated through regular meetings of t he North West, North East and South London Perinatal Mental Health Clinical Network Meetings and through reporting to the Pan London Perinatal and Mental Health Strategic Clinic al Networks. The authors have combined the views of the various stakeholders with the recommendations of all the re levant guidelines, policies and reports on perinatal menta l health available at the time of writing. PERINATAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE PATHWAYS London Perinatal Mental Health Network 2015 7 It is anticipated that the care pathway will be up dated to incorporate any updates to existing guidance as wel l as newly launched professional guidelines and government pol icies. The aim is for this pathway to be on a website. If users click on boxes in the pathway additional, more detailed, inf ormation will be available. The first set of diagrams, outlining service line strands will lead to the more specific algorithms. An example is included of the algorithms for the perinatal psychi atric service line strand. Work needs to be completed for the oth er service line strands. Potentially, localised information ab out specific services and resources can be added in to make the pathways more specific to local boroughs.

The Royal College of Psychiatrist's Perinatal Qual ity Network defines standards for community perinatal mental he alth services which will become part of an accreditation process. Standards are defined for the following areas: o Access and referral o Assessment o Care plans o Care and treatment o Discharge o Infant welfare and safeguarding o Staffing and Training o Recording and Audit PERINATAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE PATHWAYS London Perinatal Mental Health Network 2015 9 The Royal College of Psychiatrist's Perinatal Qual ity Network standards require that community perinatal mental h ealth services be staffed as follows in order to be accre dited as a good psychiatric service: o Consultant Perinatal Psychiatrist (Adult); o Non-consultant medical staff; o Perinatal community psychiatric nurses; o Social worker; o Clinical psychologist; o Nursery nurse; o Occupational therapist o Administrative and data entry support The Royal College of Psychiatrists (Council Report CR197 - July 2015) suggests staffing levels for specialised perinatal community mental health teams as follows: o The team must be led by an adult consultant perina tal psychiatrist (at least 1PA per 1000 births). This s hould be increased if there is no junior doctor support. o The team should have specialist perinatal mental h ealth nurses (at least 0.5WTE for 1,000 births). Nurses s hould have caseloads of around 25 women each It is expected that the composition and the capacit y of the workforce should be carefully tailored to the local needs of the geographical area and maternity service served by t he perinatal mental health team The Royal College of Psychiatrist's Perinatal Qual ity Network Service Standards for Mother & Baby Units is associ ated with an accreditation process. The London Perinatal Network is mindful that perin atal mental health encompasses a wide range of disciplines -psy chiatry, psychology, and psychotherapy - across both adult a nd early year's services and that it should be fully integra ted with maternity care and health visiting. Therefore, this care pathway incorporates five main interfacing strands: Materni ty & Neonatology, Maternal Psychiatry, Maternal Psychological PERINATAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE PATHWAYS London Perinatal Mental Health Network 2015 10 Therapies, Infant Mental Health, Social Care and He alth Visiting each with clearly defined professional, clinical an d managerial service line accountability. The diagrammatic divid e is a construct for ease of reference. In practice servic es may include aspects of more than one service line strand (e.g. a perinatal psychological therapies service may include psychol ogical therapies for the mother as well as parent-infant psychotherapies; or one \"perinatal mental health se rvice\" may include both the maternal mental health psychiatric and psychological therapies service line strands) The Maternity & Neonatology service line strand is expanded with a focus on integrating physical and mental hea lth. The Social Care service line strand, is explored with a focus on the interface with perinatal mental health, when the ne eds/risks are contingent upon parental psychiatric illness. Healt h visiting is envisaged as an essential component of the care-pat hway. Therefore it is expected that adequate health visit ing and perinatal specialist health visiting provisions are ensured. The maternity service must factor in specialist pr ovisions to facilitate integration of physical and mental healt h through joint clinical management, education, training and superv ision and establishment of an adequate specialist workforce, namely mental health lead midwives and obstetricians. The partnership among the two services should take the form of robu st regular training and education packages for midwives and obstetricians, joint and co-located obstetric psych iatric liaison clinics, joint management plans with active involve ment of obstetric and midwifery teams for women with comple x needs (e.g. medical complications in pregnancy) and/or se vere and enduring mental illness. Each maternity unit should have a dedicated (i.e. with clinical sessions additionally funded) obstetric consultant as the Obstetric Perinatal Mental Health lead and at least one WTE specialist perinatal mental health midwife who will work closely with the child safeguarding midwife, the perinatal psychiatrist and specialist perinatal mental health nurses forming a PERINATAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE PATHWAYS London Perinatal Mental Health Network 2015 11 dedicated multi-professional team. The specialist p erinatal mental health midwife role should be in addition to and not merged with the pre-existing child safeguarding mid wife. The service line strands span through service tier s 1, 2, 3 & 4 according to the level of complexity and risk; some interventions are likely to overlap. It is expected that Perinatal Mental Health teams will have a multi- and inter-disciplinary composition and work philosophy. However, the clinical and managerial accountability should be in accordance with the relevant professional specia lty, code of practice and clinical governance. Women referred to a PMHS may present with multiple risks at a variable level e.g. high psychiatric low obstetric risk; high mental health, high social but low psychiatric risk . The coordination of care should be led by the service o r services managing the highest level of risk. Psychological therapies may be accessed either thr ough the mother (Psychological Therapies strand) or through the infant (Infant Mental Health strand). Both routes of acces s should work with the mother and infant as a system, with a n awareness of the forming attachment. Although acces s to these therapies has been categorised in separate strands, there is likely to be an overlap in the therapy implemented in both pathways. Psychological therapies should be delivered by pra ctitioners with expertise and training in perinatal mental hea lth. This is in order to provide optimum interventions for women, w hich also takes into account the baby and the developing atta chment, to safely and effectively manage risk and to allow the interagency working necessary during the perinatal period. Whe re specialist perinatal psychological therapies are no t available, therapies will be delivered by practitioners in gen eric adult mental health services. Although women in the peri natal period PERINATAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE PATHWAYS London Perinatal Mental Health Network 2015 12 are often prioritised by these services, the provis ion is unlikely to be as specialised. The care pathway for young people (<18 years old) is the same with the exception that the psychiatric care is led by a CAMHS consultant psychiatrist. Perinatal mental health se rvices can work jointly with CAMHS services. It is expected that the relevant commissioning pro cess across London reflects the composite multiagency nature of the PMHS care pathway coherently and that all the relevant C CGs contribute to the establishment of the services acc ordingly. It is anticipated that the final configuration and the level of investment required to bring perinatal mental healt h care pathways up to standard across London will be deter mined by the extent and sustainability of pre-existing servi ce provision and local need. Principles of Care Training and supervision should be available for a ll professionals and agencies involved in the care of pregnant and postnatal women with mental illness. Practitioners with the relevant competencies and professional accreditatio ns should deliver this training. Professionals should work in partnership with wome n (and others she wishes to include: partner, family & car ers). Service provision should be matched to the woman's needs. All professionals should be sensitive to cultural needs. Advice and support should be offered to partners ( and carers). Good communication and information sharing between all professionals, the woman (and partner and family, i f she wishes to involve them) is essential. Information needs to be available for women, partn ers/family and professionals about: perinatal mental health se rvices, mental disorders, treatments, voluntary sector serv ices, other sources of information/support and advice. PERINATAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE PATHWAYS London Perinatal Mental Health Network 2015 13 Professionals should consider risk at points of tr ansition (e.g. to new midwife or GP, or move to new area).When women move to a new area or transfer their maternity care it i s essential to ensure that all relevant information is shared appr opriately with the professionals in the new area. It is important to ensure women who are homeless, those who move frequently and those who have no recourse to p ublic funds, do not fall between services. There should be systems in place to ensure that if there is significant change (e.g. relapse; domestic violence ; relationship breakdown) this is identified, communicated to all involved professionals and that a multiagency meeting is hel d if needed. Women with a primary substance misuse diagnosis sh ould be referred to a substance misuse service. In pregnanc y this should preferably be a specialist antenatal substan ce misuse service. Prescribers can access information on prescribing in pregnancy and breastfeeding from the following: o NICE Guideline for Antenatal and Postnatal Mental Health (2014) o UK Teratology Information Service (www.uktis.org) Psychological therapies services should prioritise women who are pregnant or in the first postnatal year. When many professionals are involved in a woman's care, it is important to clarify professionals' roles and clini cal accountability. All professionals should consider the need for ref erral to Children and Young People's Services (CYPS) for Safeguarding or Early Help. There should be a thorough review of previous ment al health and CYPS records as part of the assessment by the r elevant agencies.

National Centre for Infants, Toddlers and Families. Washington DC. The interventions available in the tiers described above are not mutually exclusive and parents may receive interventions that are availabl e across two tiers. 'Evidence-based' is defined as an intervention that has shown consi stent clinical effectiveness (a significant improvement in parenti ng, sensitive interactions, attachment or infant behaviour) in at least one randomised contro lled trial. In the case of family therapy, evidence was only found for its effectiveness in im proving sleeping and eating difficulties. Staff teams . It is recommended that teams should be formed bas ed on practitioners' clinical skills and their ability to provide the most eviden ce-based interventions. It is therefore recommended that staff are recruited into generic p osts - 'parent-infant mental health practitioner' which reflect a range of seniority (i .e. 1 x band 6, 1x band 7, 1x band 8 and a consultant post). At least one member of staff shou ld have an intensive outreach role to engage families in the community. Clinical backgrou nds that might fit these posts include Child Psychiatrists, Clinical Psychologists, Parent -infant Psychotherapists, therapeutically trained Nurses and Social Workers, Child Counsellor s and Systemic Family and Couples Therapists.
