Booster doses help boost the body's immune response and provide protection against the illness that the vaccination is for. A booster dose of COVID-19, therefore, helps to prevent someone from becoming seriously ill or needing to go to hospital if they catch COVID-19. For the most up-to-date information, please visit the [NHS website.](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/coronavirus-booster-vaccine/) The NHS should contact you if you're eligible for a seasonal booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine this spring. You may be offered a seasonal booster if you: - are aged 75 years or over (you need to have turned 75 on or before 30 June 2023) - live in a care home for older adults - are aged 5 years or over and have a weakened immune system To find out more about the COVID-19 spring booster or to book an appointment or find your local walk-in site, visit the [NHS website.](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/how-to-get-a-coronavirus-vaccine/how-to-get-a-booster-dose/) Boots will support NHS England to deliver the COVID-19 booster vaccinations and will be offering these at special vaccination hubs that are located in some of our pharmacy stores. To book your spring booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, please visit the [NHS booking system](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-vaccination/book-coronavirus-vaccination/). A pharmacy team member will check your details and ask you some questions before you get your vaccination to check whether it's suitable for you - you should answer these as accurately as possible. If you are attending the pharmacy with someone who is unable to answer these questions, you will need to answer for them. If you are unable to answer, we will be unable to provide the vaccination and you will be advised to contact your GP. You may be asked to wait for 15 minutes after your vaccination before you can leave the vaccination hub. "}
