The validity of this conditional approval is one ( 1) year. During this period, the DCA will periodically be updated with all necessary information related to the quality, safety and efficacy of this vaccine. The conditional registration can be revoked if the conditions are not fulfilled by the PRH or if the benefit over risk of the vaccine is no longer deemed beneficial. Q3: Why is COVILO granted a conditional registration? A3: Clinical studies for COVILO are currently still on-going.

This fulfilled the efficacy standard as recommended by WHO, where the primary efficacy endpoint point estimate for a placebo -controlled efficacy trial should be at least 50%, and the lower bound of confidence interval (CI) should be >30%. More data is expected from other ongoing Phase III trials in other countries on a rolling review basis. Q10: How long will COVILO provide protection?
