To produce that energy, they need to be powered with their most important meal of day: fuel. This is where members of the petroleum, oil and lubricants 51st Logistics Readiness Squadron fuels management flight apply their skillsets to get the engines running. The flight is responsible for fueling more than 1,400 government operating vehicles and aircraft on base. \"They say Osan is a walking base, but the majority of the units here rely on vehicles to get their mission done,\" said Master Sgt. Christopher Paul Macfadden, section chief with the 51st LRS fuels information service center. To ensure their mission does not fail, the flight of approximately 60 Airmen and U.S. and Korean civilian employees work with 14 fuel trucks to get fuel to aircraft and gasoline dispensaries for government vehicle refueling. \"We have a great working relationship with our local nationals,\" said Master Sgt. Jay Elledge, fuels operations section chief with the 51st LRS. \"If we didn't have the synergy, it could affect our ability to get fuel from one place to another.\" Throughout the year an estimated 23 million gallons of fuel is delivered and used at Osan, to include jet fuel, diesel and gasoline.By Staff Sgt. Sergio A. Gamboa 51st Fighter Wing Public Affairs PAGE 4 | CRIMSON SKY February 8, 2019 nEWS KUNSAN AIR BASE, Republic of Korea -- Every installation has a multitude of offices who help support day-to-day operations at their specific location. The 8th Civil Engineer Squadron structures shop, here, has Airmen who not only support the 8th Fighter Wing, but help improve and maintain other work centers around the base. \"Our mission is to ensure that the facilities stay in good repair and working order so that everyone else can do their mission,\" said Staff Sgt. Josiah Sorrels, 8th CES lock shop noncommissioned officer in charge. \"The structures shop is responsible for the maintenance and expansion of all the facilities on base. We cover everything from carpentry to masonry to metal work.\" These wide range of skills that structural Airmen bring to the table are what makes them a unique career field in the Air Force. At Kunsan, there are different challenges they run into here than a base in the U.S., but their training keeps them going.\"We have a lot of work in this country, for example, duct work, sheet metal, that's not very common amongst other bases. And of course, there's the language barrier as well,\" said Sorrels. \"It's fun, I enjoy these challenges. It's nice to be able to overcome these. There's always another way...we haven't been stopped yet.\" Despite the challenges faced, the structures shop completed more than 1,200 work tasks in 2018 with a small team comprised of Koreans and Americans. Staff Sgt. Coleman Ballard, 8th CES structural craftsman, said one priority project for the team was fixing the baffles at the 8th Security Forces Squadron firing range. Baffles are angled wood surfaces attached to the ceiling that helps prevent ricochets from bullets fired at targets. \"There were a total of nine baffles that needed to be repaired due to weathering over the years. The screws they used had rusted away and the plywood started to fall down...causing a huge safety concern,\" said Ballard. \"We replaced a total of 5,200 square feet of plywood in 5 weeks with only six people.\" With projects that can last from minutes to months, Kunsan Airmen can rest easy knowing the structures shop is here to help them reach mission success. \"I like being able to go work and just do different things each day,\" said Sorrels. \"It really presents a challenge and you just feel accomplished at the end of the day.\" *Editor's Note: This is the third article in a series designed to highlight innovative efforts, large and small, that are improving infrastructure at Kunsan Air Base.

Over the last decade or so, the USAF Dental Corps has seen significant improvements in efficiency and customer care support due to innovation such as advancement in computer-aided design (CAD) or computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) screen capabilities. These innovative programs will be implemented at Kunsan in the near future, which will help shorten the waiting time for procedures such as building crowns for teeth. This procedure often takes weeks to complete but with CAD/CAM capabilities, the time is expected to be cut in half, said Bannister. Kunsan and the rest of the U.S. Air Force Dental Services should also see a change in patient records. \"I think it's really important to be able to talk across our system, and across the different services and locations,\" Bannister said. \"It's hard to treat patients without a record. We are in the early phases of transitioning to electronic health records, which will open up amazing opportunities to be able to have that continuity of care, no matter where our service members go.\" During her visit, Bannister experienced the extraordinary dedication to readiness the Wolf Pack is known for, as well as the close ties developed in personnel's short time on the Korean peninsula. \"When you're in a location where you always need to be ready to go, like Kunsan, it's impressive to see that unity of effort and purpose,\" Bannister said. \"You don't have your families here, but you become each other's family. Yes, we work hard, we train hard, we are focused on the mission, but it's also a lot of fun.\" Bannister encourages Airmen everywhere to focus on being ready today, tomorrow, and always. \"I charge each of you to focus on readiness\u2014 ensuring a dental ready force and ready dental force,\" Bannister said. \"Our nation is counting on us to ensure the Department of Defense is ready to support the global mission\u2014and I have no doubt we are up for the charge.\"NEWS U.S. Air Force Brig.

Senior Airman Nathan Howard, a biomedical equipment technician with the 51st Medical Support Squadron, received the achievement from the Air Force Surgeon General for demonstrating expertise, leadership and commitment to the Air Force's medical mission. \"I am happy that I received the award,\" said Howard. \"This last year was hard work, and I did not expect to be selected for the award. Even though I was selected for this award, I could not have accomplished it without my team. The support they provided was instrumental in allowing me to succeed.\" This past year, Howard was able to complete 575 work orders, augment war reserve material personnel for four weeks, as well as deploy to the ROK in support of Operation Southern Hope in which he established a 270 bed military treatment facility. \"Airman Howard was instrumental in the exercise Southern Hope,\" said Master Sgt. Charles Wolfe, clinical engineering flight chief with the 51st MDSS. \"He provided excellent support there by taking care of the initial setup of a lot of equipment that needed to be installed to get the facility up and running.\" Howard recently moved from Travis Air Force Base, California, a unit assigned to Air Mobility Command, and has already made an impact at his new shop at Osan. \"His help has been invaluable to the mission that we do at Osan,\" said Capt.

BULLETIN PAGE 7 | CRIMSON SKY February 8, 2019 nEWS FALLS CHURCH, Va . -- As space continues to play an increasingly critical role in our nation's defense, the need for the space medicine specialty grows. Medical Airmen within U.S. Air Force Space Command are making sure space operators are ready for future readiness requirements. \"Space is no longer a neutral, docile domain,\" said Col. Walter \"Sparky\" Matthews, AFSPC Command Surgeon. \"It has become a contested environment where many state and non-state actors actively seek to disrupt U.S. space capability.\" It is the role of AFSPC medics to ensure space operators are medically ready to complete their mission, and to optimize their performance, while also preparing for the future of space medicine. Space operators have unique readiness requirements because they are employed in place, meaning they must maintain readiness and high vigilance every day. Currently in the Air Force, \"space medicine is the field of medicine that cares for the space operators who launch, monitor and operate our satellite systems,\" said Col. Brian Agee, Chief of Aerospace Medicine for AFSPC. \"It also includes launch and recovery support for astronauts.\" To prepare for future readiness needs, AFSPC medics are developing the requirements and training for future space surgeons, building on current training requirements. Specifically, AFSPC medical Airmen are focusing on four areas of interest: managing fatigue exposure; defining fitness to meet the needs of line commanders; working within the specification of deployment and readiness; and evaluating retention standards for certain conditions. \"We are also pursuing space operations basic training for all medical personnel who support the space mission,\" said Matthews. \"It is important that all medical personnel, including nurses, techs and administrators who support the space medicine mission have a common baseline understanding of what makes the space domain different.\" During the early years of the U.S. space program, Air Force doctors led the way in the space medicine field, but NASA later assumed most medical responsibilities for its astronauts. Today, understanding of the space Col. Brian Agee, Air Force Space Command Surgeon General Chief of Aerospace Medicine, goes over the daily improvements board, with Lt. Col. Meredith Sarda and Maj. Chris Noah, during the morning meeting at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado, Oct. 19, 2018. Medical Airmen assigned to U.S. Air Force Space Command are charged with delivering care to the Airmen who launch, monitor and operate the Air Force's satellite systems.

As space continues to play an increasingly critical role in our nation's defense, medical Airmen in AFSPC are also preparing for the future of space medicine. (U.S. Air Force illustration) By Shireen Bedi, Air Force Surgeon General Public AffairsGrowing Air Force's space medicine culture environment's effect on the human body is growing at a fast pace. As space becomes an ever more important domain, AFSPC medical Airmen continue to keep up with that growth in knowledge. Space medicine builds off aerospace medicine and ties closely to occupational and preventive medicine, accounting for the impact that the space environment has on the body. This includes oxygen, pressure, acceleration, radiation, communication issues, logistics, and isolation. Space medicine has to account for all of this. \"Part of what makes space medicine a distinct specialty is the ability to adapt to this pace,\" said Agee. \"The unpredictability and vastness of space drives us to constantly anticipate, adapt and use existing data to predict future needs.\" \"Space is a completely different and separate domain from any other in which the U.S. Air force operates,\" said Matthews. \"This is the reason for our development of a team of space medicine specialists that exist in a space medicine culture.\" AFSPC medical Airmen like Matthews and Agee are eager to take on the challenges and prepare Airmen for future readiness requirements. \"These are exciting times and I am fortunate to be involved, and grateful for this opportunity to be part of our revolutionary undertakings here at AFSPC,\" said Agee.February 8, 2019 CRIMSON SKY | P AGE 8 NEWS OSAN AIR BASE, Republic of Korea -- When it comes to developing Airmen and providing feedback, Team Osan used a new tool Jan. 28-29 to train its company-grade officers: The Flight Commander Course. The course seeks to lay a solid foundation of communication strategies and distill effective leadership habits in the Air Force's future squadron and group commanders. \"When we get bogged down with our day-to-day mission, there's always going to be taskers. Sometimes we don't take time out to develop ourselves as well as others,\" said Chief Master Sgt. Roy Hensley, superintendent with the 51st Logistics Readiness Squadron. \"One of my big takeaways is not just being receptive, but also learning how to use effective, timely and honest feedback.\" Hensley said that the earlier Airman leadership and development are maximized in CGOs, the better prepared they will be when they're in a commander position. \"You can help guide a vision from planting seeds too early, but if you wait too long it's harder to change the way people have their foundation set,\" he said. The course isn't only a standard classroom-style lecture. The officers also participate in guided discussions to explore concepts and hypothetical situations in depth. \"This is my second time as a flight commander, and I've never been to a flight commander development course, so my squadron commander thought it was a good idea that I attend,\" said. Maj. Gary Webb, emergency room flight commander with the 51st Medical Group. \"All of it leads into Airmen development. Our job is to guide Airmen to be successful in the mission, at the same time, learn how to take care of them, keep them safe and hold them accountable.\" Webb emphasized the need to value their troops' personal well-being, as their Airmen's lives outside of the mission can have a direct impact on their performance at work. Upon completion, course leadership will solicit feedback from class participants and will continue to build a more robust curriculum to train officers for future leadership responsibilities. By Senior Airman Savannah L. Waters, 8th Fighter Wing Public Affairs \"Without POL, pilots are just pedestrians,\" said Macfadden. \"We are one of, if not, the most important resource on the base.\" The flight outputs roughly a million gallons of fuel to its assets monthly. \"Part of maintaining a healthy system is ensuring we have system integrity,\" said Elledge. \"Recently, we have contracted the cleaning of our bulk fuel tanks to ensure we can issue clean, dry fuel to our customers.\" The unit makes sure fuel is ready at moment's notice and contaminant free by filtering it and inspecting for water, dirt or debris to avoid mission delay. \"It's not the most glamourous job, we understand that,\" said Elledge. \"We are out there driving those big green ugly fuel trucks, but we look at them like Mercedes because they are our pride and joy. What we have in the back of the trucks is a sought out commodity and without that fuel, aircraft aren't flying and are just static displays. \"Our POL Airmen are amazing and perform at a high level,\" Elledge added. \"We've got America's sons and daughters over here making things happen and ensuring Osan is ready to fight tonight.\" - Continued from page 3 - CGOs benefit from new leadership course U.S. Air Force Chief Master Sgt.

By World War II the migrants continued to move North but many of them headed west to Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco, California, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington. The northern demand for workers was a result of the loss of 5 million men who left to serve in the armed forces, as well as the restric - tion of foreignimmigration. Some sectors of the economy were so desperate for workers at this time that they would payfor black African Americans to migrate north. The Pennsylvania Railroad needed workers so badly that it paid the travel expenses of 12,000 black migrants. The Illinois Central Railroad, along with many steel mills, factories, and tanneries, similarly provided free railroad passes for black migrants. World War I was the first time since Emancipation that labor was in demand outside of the agricultural south, and the economic promise was enough for many black migrants to overcome sub - stantial challenges to migrate.AFN SURVEY: Want to make AFN bet - ter?

Moreover, we learn that when two people unite deeply in love, it's as if they \"cleave to each and become one flesh\" (Genesis 2:24). From the time of Adam and Eve until today, countless couples have demonstrated the remarkable power of love and devotion in their relationships. As we approach Valentine's Day, I want to share with you one inspiring story that demonstrates what true love and devotion look like. More than 50 years ago, Luther Younger met a woman named Waverlee in a laundromat. After gazing at Waverlee, Luther went over to her and said \"You're a beautiful lady...you got a husband?\" She replied \"No...my husband is a drunk.\" Luther responded \"I need somebody\" and Waverlee said \"I need somebody nice.\" The two have been together ever since. In 2009, Waverlee developed a brain tumor that forced her in and out of a Rochester, NY hospital. Some months ago, she was once again lying helplessly in the hospital, this time in the intensive care unit with a breathing tube attached to her throat and her eyes closed. Regardless of Waverlee's nearly unresponsive condition, Luther made it a point to visit his wife every day. Adding to the intrigue is the fact that Luther is 77 years-old and he walked 6 miles round-trip every day to see her, no matter the weather. Moreover, he is so in love with his wife, he turned down offers of a ride by his daughter and other local admirers so he could think about his wife on his long journey. Sometimes, he quickened his trip by running along the way; especially as he neared the hospital. In explaining his eagerness to be by Waverlee's side, Luther said \"that's my wife, she's my best friend.\" Once inside the hospital, Luther would make his way to his beloved's bed. Gently bending over her, Luther placed his lips on Waverlee's and said \"baby give me a kiss, give me a kiss.\" Although barely discernable to the casual observer, Luther insisted that his wife's eyes fluttered every time they kissed. While gently holding Waverlee's hand, Luther further explained why he loves his wife so much: \"I love her because she was tough. She wasn't easy. She was the type of person if you didn't work, you got to go. And I had to work. And she helped me with all my kids. They weren't none of her kids. That's why I'm sticking with her, because if it hadn't been for my wife, I wouldn't have made it. (She's) my cup of tea....and it's sweet too.\" At the end of his visits, Luther would kiss her again before walking 3 miles back home. Saying to himself along the way \"that's the best cup of tea I ever had in my life\", Luther couldn't wait for the next day to arrive so he could once again spend time with the love of his life. The Bible tells us that genuine love can cleave two people together as one flesh. Luther and Waverlee fit that description for they demonstrate what deep love and devotion look like. This Valentine's Day, whether you're in a committed relationship or not, I wish you the kind of love that Luther and Waverlee share, a true love, a timeless love, a love that is \"the sweetest and best cup of tea\" you'll ever drink in your life. SPIRITUAL CHARGE Chaplain, Major Gary DavidsonThis is What True Love and Devotion Look Like PAGE 15 | CRIMSON SKY February 8, 2019 nEWS WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE, Mo. (AFNS) -- \"We've been innovating since the Wright Brothers, since we first took flight,\" said Brig. Gen. John J. Nichols, B-2 Spirit pilot and commander of the 509th Bomb Wing at Whiteman Air Force Base. \"We are a service of innovation.\" Across the Air Force, changes to equipment, policies and procedures have been made to save money, to save time and to save lives. From the highest levels, Airmen across the service are being encouraged to innovate. It's this innovation that will deliver lethality to outpace adversaries, says Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David L. Goldfein, and maintain the U.S. position as the world's strongest, most powerful military. One such innovation came in response to a recognized potential issue within the B-2 - the world's most strategic aircraft and the heart of the stealth mission at Whiteman AFB. A four-switch panel called the airframe mounted accessory drive, or AMAD, sits on the left side of the B-2's two-person cockpit. The AMAD switches control the connection of the engines to the hydraulic and generator power of the aircraft. \"We wanted to make sure that these switches were protected,\" said Nichols. \"I had a feeling if we tapped our community partners, they would work hand-in-hand with our Airmen.\" An innovative partnershipNichols said he believes innovation can come from anywhere, including the younger generation. So, he called Jerrod Wheeler, Knob Noster School District superintendent, the lead school administrator in the small town just outside of Whiteman AFB, to see if the high school robotics team could help the base with a solution. Nichols' initial simple suggestion resembled a rectangular, rounded butter-dish looking cover that would be secured over the switches to protect them. The cover would have to be a perfect, customized fit that would not come loose during flight, while also allowing the pilots to see the switches beneath it. Wheeler took the challenge to Christopher J. Adams ,Knob Noster High School engineering and technology education teacher, and his Stealth Panther Robotics students, who readily accepted. \"Part of what we do in engineering class is to apply the design process to a problem,\" said Adams, describing how the students drafted a variety of prototype designs and printed them on the school's 3-D printer. Throughout the process, the students were guided by several seasoned B-2 pilots. \"It was impressive to see the ingenuity and the initiative in each of these students,\" said Maj. Joe Manglitz, a B-2 evaluator pilot. \"They're young high school students, but they're incredibly smart. They're the type of people we need in the future of our country and certainly in the future of our Air Force.\" The students met with Nichols throughout the process and also visited the B-2 simulator to test their prototype. \"I thought it was great when they completely rose to the level of the folks they were with,\" said Adams. \"I was super proud of them absolutely grasping the gravity of the situation and the problem, the seriousness, and then handling themselves like professionals far beyond their years.\"With the feedback and perspective they gained through these interactions, the students went back to the digital drawing board. 'A dollar twenty-five'\"My favorite part of this process was being able to talk geek with all the people involved,\" said Gabriel Gish, a KNHS junior and military child, who serves as the robotics team leader for the design and prototype section of the Stealth Panthers. He discussed some of the challenges the team faced through the design and production process, ensuring the necessary level of heat produced by the 3-D printer for stable panel covers. They also needed to find a way to affix the covers to the AMAD panel without permanently altering it. \"We realized the dual-lock Velcro we use on our robots would work really well,\" said Gish. From the initial design to the final printed cover, there were eight structurally different designs. With feedback from the pilots, the robotics team made small modifications to ensure the cover could be easily gripped and removed, as well as withstand the pressurization and heat requirements of flight. Furthermore, the switches needed to be visible to the pilots at all times. After extensive testing and levels of approval - Nichols was the first pilot to fly a B-2 with the cover in place - the AMAD panel cover is now being used inside all 20 of the Air Force's B-2 stealth aircraft. \"It feels really good to be able to say that I helped keep B-2 pilots safe,\" said Gish. Nichols sang the praises of the students.\"This team of high school, STEM-related, super-smart students printed this,\" said Nichols, punctuating his sentence in the air using the AMAD panel cover in his hand. \"Seventy-two hours from the initial design concept to the final product at the grand total cost of a dollar twenty-five a copy.\" Nichols highlighted the collaborative effort between the Airmen and the student robotics team. \"This is an unbelievable story of partnering and innovation, which has brought a known level of risk down in a short period of time,\" said Nichols. \"I'm so proud of this team. I am so proud of this partnership with the local community and these kids over at Knob Noster High School. They just did an amazing job.\" Stealth pilots, high school students create innovative part for $2.2 billion aircraft By Staff Sgt. Peter Thompson 33rd Fighter Wing Students on the Knob Noster High School robotics team, outside of Whiteman Air Force Base, Mo., designed a protective panel that covers four switches in the cockpit of the $2.2 billion B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. Each panel costs $1.25 to produce. A four-switch panel called the airframe mounted accessory drive, or AMAD, sits on the left side of the B-2's two- person cockpit.

Tax season is generally February through April 15th, but it's never too early to plan. Here is some pertinent information 8th Fighter Wing Airmen should know about filing and paying taxes from the Wolf Pack: 1. While service members in the United States must file their taxes by April 17, Wolf Pack Airmen get a two-month extension to June 15 due to their overseas duty status. However, this extension is only for the tax return. Taxes due must still be paid by the normal deadline in April. 2. The 8th Fighter Wing Judge Advocate's Office will provide legal assistance relating to income tax issues year round. They will also make computers available for those who want to use an online service and are available answer questions as they fill out their forms, but will not operate a full one-on-one tax center. Service members can call DSN 782-4283 to inquire about more information. 3. The 51st Fighter Wing Judge Advocate's Office at Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea, will have a full tax center which will be open from Feb. 19 until the end of tax season. Services will be available by appointment only every Tuesday and Thursday for pay grades E-1 through E-4, and O-1 and O-2. Service members can call DSN 784-4131 to inquire about more information or to schedule an appointment. 4. Service members are encouraged to utilize Military OneSource online. This website provides 24/7 support for military personnel, spouses, family members and survivors, offering a wide range of individualized consultations, coaching and non-medical counseling for many aspects of military life, including taxes. Visit militaryonesource.mil for more information. 5. The IRS website, IRS.gov, is another online source that offers a wide variety of information that service members may find useful; such as refund statuses, tax records, free services for filing taxes, making payments, and special rules and deadlines that may apply for combat zone service or service outside the U.S. The Airman & Family Readiness Center encourages Airmen to develop a plan and responsibly spend their refund. \"There are many financial plans for gaining individual financial capability, the most simple one being B.S.I.R., which stands for Budget, Savings, Investing, and Retirement,\" said Brian Bentz, Airman & Family Readiness Center community readiness consultant. \"Monitor your income and expenses, and outline your surplus and deficit. Establish a plan for your emergency and goal savings, and invest for tomorrow. Plan for your future.\" Using financial tactics for daily spending and incidentals, creating and sticking to a plan, and seeking financial assistance whenever possible can help Airmen decide how to best use their tax return, as well as develop other financial plans, Bentz said. \"The majority of Airmen with a family who have been in service for four years or more live paycheck to paycheck with little savings, acquiring debt quoting 'the more money you make, the more money you spend,'\" Bentz said. \"Financial education is not taken seriously among service members, and financially uneducated service members end up in debt. Plan for tomorrow (meaning 40 years from now), and not for today.\" Ensuring you file your taxes correctly and learning how to budget your returns is important, because as the old saying goes: \"Nothing is certain, except death and taxes.\" Pertinent 2018 Tax information for Wolf Pack Airmen By Senior Airman Savannah L. Waters, 8th Fighter Wing Public Affairs A U.S. Individual Income Tax Return 1040 form is displayed at Kunsan Air Base, Republic of Korea, Jan. 17, 2019. The IRS is the nation's tax collection agency, and administers the Internal Revenue Code enacted by Congress. Its website offers a wide variety of information that service members may find useful. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Savannah L. Waters) SMOKING SAFETY According to the National Fire Incident Reporting System for 2018, we had 128 dumpster or garbage fires in the Air Force. These fires are absolutely preventable! If you smoke or live with someone who smokes, learn the facts. A lit cigarette accidentally dropped onto a chair or bed, hot cigarette ashes or matches tossed away before they are completely extinguished can ignite a fire in seconds. Smoking & Home Fire Action Steps: If you smoke, smoke at the designated area. Whenever you smoke, use deep, sturdy ashtrays. Keep matches and lighters up high out of children's sight and reach. To prevent a deadly cigarette fire, you have to be alert. You won't be if you are sleepy, have been drinking, or have taken medicine or other drugs. Before you throw out butts and ashes, make sure they are out, and dousing in water or sand is the best way to do that. Never smoke in a home where oxygen is used. (Ref: U.S. Fire Administration) Smoking in Air Force facilities is prohibited in most cases. (Ref: AFI 40-102, Tobacco Use in the Air Force) All areas will be considered \"NO SMOKING\" areas unless a \"DESIGNATED SMOKING AREA\" sign is posted.

People often refer to the 4 seasons of Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter, but a year actually goes through 24 seasons. Every season feels cold, hot, long nighted, short nighted, and many other changes in weather and time; this change is known as a \"solar term\". In the modern age, which cannot be called a farming society, many customs of the 24 solar terms have faded, but can still be related to people's lives. Korean Solar Season's matches where the sun is in relationship to the earth's celestial sphere. This is known as the ecliptic, or the orbit of the earth around the sun. This allows astronomy's to determine the positions of other objects in our night sky. The ecliptic degree for each solar season is correlated with astronomical seasons (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter), not to the Solar Seasons.

The final spring break of high school has commenced. What better way to celebrate than with the clamor of conversation and laughter among good friends. The boyish compulsion to impress girls at any cost and the youthful mindset of invincibility included riding in the back of a truck on a seemingly innocuous afternoon drive to pick up a friend. For Kevin Waterhouse, then 17 years old, spring break came to an abrupt end when he was riding in the bed of the truck and the driver lost control on a curve, crashing into a home at 80 miles per hour. The impact of his body against the cab of the truck resulted in, among a gruesome laundry list of injuries, his spinal cord being severed in three separate places leaving him paralyzed from the chest down. Spring break was not the only thing that ended for Waterhouse that day. His cross-country pursuits. His dream of attending the Air Force Academy or enlisting to serve in the Coast Guard. His ability to walk. All dashed in an instant. \"I never once considered that I might not have the use of my legs someday,\" said Waterhouse. \"It never crossed my mind as a possibility, so all of my planning was military. Air Force, Coast Guard, police, maybe and all of a sudden I can't do my plan, my backup plan or the backup plan to my backup plan. I had to refigure out what I wanted to do with my life.\" Almost 22 years, two degrees, countless people young and old being influenced by his story, and one book later, Kevin now serves as the wing commander's secretary for the 403rd Wing at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi. After such an accident, especially at such a young age, one would expect a grieving period or maybe a period of depression to have occurred, but Waterhouse said he never went through a \"why me?\" phase. He credits the support from those around him as his initial catalyst towards resiliency and being able to rise to the new, unexpected challenges he was faced with. Despite the physical setback, Waterhouse said being in a wheelchair has taught him a lot and given him valuable insight on the subject of resiliency and has allowed him to teach and help others. According to the Merriam- Webster dictionary, resilience is defined as the capability of a strained body to recover its size and shape after deformation caused especially by compressive stress or an ability to recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change. Those black and white explanations suffice for non-human elements such as a business model or a memory foam mattress, but human challenges are so unique to each individual facing them that resiliency cannot be defined or explained in so few lines. For Waterhouse, there is a lot of learning and adaptation involved in order to be resilient. \"Resiliency,\" he said, \"is having faith that no matter what happens you are going to have the strength to get through it or that you already have the strength to get through it. You just have to learn how to tap into it.\" He also said an important factor of resiliency is gratitude. Focusing on and being grateful for what he has rather than lamenting over what he has lost allows for Waterhouse to maintain a positive outlook and attitude which provides him with the ability to move forward. After his accident, in his quest to figure out what to do with his life, Waterhouse said he traveled the country for 15 years. He worked at camps, volunteered at places like the YMCA and visited newly disabled people in hospitals with his service dog, Jade, to lift others up. \"Extend the hand of service,\" Waterhouse said as advice to those facing a challenge. \"There is nothing like losing yourself in service to help you be grateful for what you have.\" Just like any other person's path in life, except for the part where he was in a wheelchair, Waterhouse did from time to time face adversity in the form of people underestimating his capabilities. Shortly after the accident, he revisited his life-long aspirations to serve his country by talking with an Air Force recruiter post-accident thinking surely there was still some way he could serve his country. The recruiter explained to him that due to his physical disabilities, the best way he could serve the military was to go home and pay his taxes. Waterhouse, not allowing anyone to dictate his capabilities took the advice with a grain of salt and continued to push himself, despite setbacks like losing his leg and all of his toes to infection. He pursued higher education at Ottawa University in Ottawa, Kansas where he graduated first with a Bachelor's degree in business administration and later with a Master's in the same subject area. After finishing his education, his life-long desire to somehow serve his country just like his Army Ranger father and his government-employed mother remained. He took matters into his own hands and said he filled out over 180 job applications for federal employment. Evidently those efforts paid off and landed him with the Air Force Reserve as a civil servant in December 2017. Col. Jennie R. Johnson, 403rd Wing commander, hired Waterhouse. \"I was so impressed by his positive attitude, personality and accomplishments,\" she said. \"There is no job too big or small. He attacks every project with enthusiasm. He is a great addition to our staff and this wing.\" \"The leadership team here has been very supportive,\" said Waterhouse. \"They gave me my shot and gave me the chance to get in.\" Surrounding himself with supportive people, believing in his ability to adapt and remaining grateful no matter what, continues to be the pillars of resilience for Waterhouse every day.
