The amount of coffee in the remedy would be tiny (nowhere near enough to give you the usual effects of caffeine), and usually mixed in a light alcohol or water solution. By preparing the remedy in this way, the healing essence of the substance is carried over to the solution. Naturopathy encompasses a variety of natural treatments, like supplements, herbs, and dietary advice.

The speed of homeopathic remedies changes depending on the problem being treated, and its severity. Chronic problems can take longer to see effects, for example.

Some homeopathic remedies are also taken in a series of doses, which can obviously affect the time it takes for them to work. Homeopathy is a complementary medicine, which means it complements conventional health approaches. So it's absolutely fine to take homeopathic remedies with conventional medicine, although you should outline your medications to your homeopath to be on the safe side. Conventional medicines can also be extremely potent, and in some cases, block the effects of homeopathic remedies, which is another reason for communicating your medications "}
