The pathogenesis of this degeneration is unknown or also known as idiopathic2 which is the most obvious and well known manifestation of this neurodegenerative disease. Dopamine3 production and regulation is one of the most vital task s carried out by the brain for normal behavior . It has a multifaceted function in the human brain such as movement, memory, cognition, sleep, mood and other physiology of the body. Movement is a critical area affected by the loss of dopamine production. The basal g anglia4 which is linked to the Thalamus regulates coordinated movement and requires certain amount of dopamine to function efficiently. The action of dopamine occurs through the dopamine receptors5 D1-5 (D1-5 are a family of receptors that control overall movement) and nigrostriatal pathway which creates a junction between substantia nigra and striatum. The nigrostriatal pathway6 is the direct and indirect control factor of the thalamus. Dopamine reduces the influence of the indirect pathway and increases the functions of the direct pathway within the basal ganglia. The t halamus has an excitatory respon se signal for the motor cortex (allowing for movement) when unregulated results in the most common symptom; slowness of movement (bradykinesia) . Motor symptoms occurs at approximately at the 80% loss of the dopamine neuron [See Figure 1 ]. Other common symptoms /issues associated with Parkinson's Disease such as sleepiness, fatigue, cognitive decline, impaired speech, anosmia, and altered mood levels . 1 Dopaminergic neurons : releasing or involving dopamine as a neurotransmitter. Drugs with this effect are used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and some psychiatric disorders; some are subject to abuse. 2 Idiopathic : relating to or denoting any disease or condition that arises spontaneously or for which the cause is unknown. 3 Dopamine : a compound present in the body as a neurotransmitter and a precursor of other substances including epinephrine. 4 Basal ganglia: a group of structures linked to the thalamus in the base of the brain and involved in coordination of movement. [Figure 1] 5 D1-5: are a family of receptors that control overall movement. 6 nigrostriatal pathway : a biochemical and anatomy junction between substantia nigra and striatum. [Figure 1] 2 An Insight into Ayurvedic Medicine and Timeline The earliest reference to \"shaking palsy\" in west ern medical literature comes from Galen7 during 138- 201 AD era and a complete picture was provided by James Parkinson8 in 1817 regarding the symptoms to what became Parkinson's Disease (PD). These explorers of the human state definitely look to a more ancient form of medicine known as Ayurveda. Arguably one of the most comprehensive ancient literature, the Ayurveda sought to compile the knowledge of human imbalances and the counteractive treatment for it. This ancient system of health care is estimated to be originated and practiced in India between 5000 to 3000 BC . [Figure 2 ] The word Ayurveda9 comes from the root of 'veda' meaning 'knowledge or science.' Quintessentially, Ayurveda stems from observations of systematic imbalances and seeks to counter act it with alternative and herbal -based treatment. Furthermore, it holds a historic precedence of being an alternative method to typical allopathic medicine in several countries such as Nepal, Tibet, Sri Lanka , Burma, Malaysia and Indonesia iii. These countries present a fertile ground for further research on the effective usage of non- allopathic medicine in parallel with a llopathy practices. The Ayurvedic approach can be typically divided into three theoretical called Tridosha approach which are psychological )iv. This is treatment approach is similar to prevailing allopathic medicine as a way for patients to better manage their malfunctions or problem. But mostly allopathy focuses on mostly the 'vata,'which is considered the imbalance on the physical leveliv. 'Shaky palsy ,' as a specific disorderi, is described as 'kampavata' which is derived from the sankrit root of ' kampa' meaning tremors and ' vata' being 7 Galen : (129- 199) Greek physician; full name Claudios Galenos; Latin name Claudius Galenus. While attempting to systematize medicine, he made important discoveries in anatomy and physiology. 8 Parkinson's Disease : late 19th century: named after James Parkinson (1755 -1824), English surgeon. 9 Ayurveda : (medical literature/text) from the Sanskrit root of 'yur' meaning 'life' and 'veda' meaning 'knowledge or science.' Ancient system of health care is estimated to be originated and practiced in India between 5000 to 30 00 BC 3 a physical manifestation. Furthermore, the Ayurvedic literature uses various terminologies to tackle the diverse range of symptomatic severity such as 'kampana,' 'vep ana,' 'vepathu,' and 'spandana'iv. The Ayurveda describes the typical motor and non -motor symptoms of PD as tremors (kampa), stiffness (stambha), and depression (vishada)iii. These predominant and identifiable symptoms are still used in modern -day prog nosis made by medical doctors and specialists in the movement disorder field. This evidence suggests that the clinical symptoms of parkinsonism were identified much earlier than the time of Galen and James Parkinsonii. Furthermore, a precise therapy plan i nvolved a combination of edible medications, enemas, massages, and nasal instillations of fixed solutions . The essential plant based drugs are derived from Aswagandha Atmagupta ( Mucuna prureins )ix. Analysis of Ancient and Modern Literature This primary section serves a purpose of comparing the diagnostic tools and identifying non-motor symptoms that were used by ancient physicians an d modern- day clinicians. The physical examination according to contemporary medical sciences is consist of four methods - inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation. This same methodology is taught in Caraka which can be seen from the image below: [Sample #1] The rough translation of this is, \"Seeking to know the nature of a disease by direct observation, the physician should explore by means of all his sense -organs except the tongue, the entire field of sensible data presented by the patient's body\" (Caraka, Nidana Sthana). This methodology is 4 what is being used to the present day by the use of sensory inputs , within r easonable manner , as a prognostic tool. This is most pertinent to the Pitta's (physiology) of the Parkinsoni sm and Parkinson's Disease since it is almost inarguable that this neurological d isorder is a systemic disorder of the body as well. This same aspect was discussed by Galen in De tremore10, and Book II of De Causis Morborum11, the deriving factors of a disease to a physician is through the four - fold system - vision, smell, taste, and to the touch. The similarities between both are clearly visible especi ally in the way diagnosis is made in the present day often involve these sensory systems . Furthermore, the specific diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and pre -motor symptoms are identified in the Caraka and Sushruta Samhita of the Ayurveda. [Sample #1] One particular part of Parkinson's Disease (PD) that needs to be focused on is pre-motor symptoms such as hyposmia. Modern science knows this as the potential dysregulation of the olfactory bulbs12 situated below the frontal cortex of the brain results in the loss of smell. A popular hypothesis indicates that alpha -synuclein13 begins to clump in these parts of the body before affecting the brain. This is a common pre -condition of PD is the pathological hallmark and Ayurvedic medicine addresses the potential causes of it along with many other non- motor symptoms . 10 De Tremor e, palpitatione, convulsion et. Rigore : by Galen 11 De Causis Morborum : The cause of diseases by Galen 12 Olfactory bulb : is a structure that is located beneath the forebrain is a sensory input receiver from the cells in the nasal cavity. 13 Alpha -synuclein or -synuclein : is a protein whose functionality in the brain is not fully known but is very important because it makes up the majority of Lewy bodies in the brain cells of PD patients. 5 [Sample #2] [Sample #2] Building on the process of a diagnosis, the way diseases manifest themselves and their previous forms are also instilled in the A yurvedic principles. These previous forms are cal led \"prva rpa\" and play a significant role in building a comprehensive review of ailments and patient history (Caraka Samhita). Thus, a trained or even a trainee can follow a systematic approach to the treatment of a diagnosis especially major conditions such as PD. The prescribed tools in the treating physician's arsenal involve \" vihara,14\" \"hra,15\" and \"bhesaja16.\" This systematic approach is driven three principles of treatment; \"hetu\" (causal agent), \"vydhi\" (primary disease) and when combined become \"hetu vydhi\" (cause and disease). Although many would argue that these methodologies are rooted in medieval notions of anatomy and physiology as seen wit h the middle English traditions of the humoral bodies 17. In contrary, the resemblances of Ayurvedic is much more in line with contemporary parallels to Osteopathic/Medical philosophy and while supplementing it with a holistic medical approach . The shift tow ards holistic medicine begins with the funda mental change in the way modern -day physicians treat patients. This approach 14 Vihara: regimens (modern translation of medical treatment plans) 15 hra: dietary treatment plan 16 Bhesaja: (Drugs) Concocted combination of plants, minerals/vitamins, and other bioactive agents in forming drugs. 17 Humoral Bodies : the medieval notion of anatomy and physiology being tied in with seasons and dispositions. 6 focuses not only on allopathic issues but also incorporating lifestyle factors and public health/policy. [Sample #3] This is developed further with the medical respo nsibilities, the nature of caregiving, and moral duties which have many similarities both in Ayurvedic times and the writing of even Hippocrates. Take for the line mentioned below from Caraka Samhita and a case study by the ancient physician Vaidya: [Sample #3] Vaidya declares the patient incurable but adheres to regulations of society and medicine by saying, \"The patient suffering from cough born of consumption with all the symptoms of consumption fully developed, who is debilitated should be considered incurable but if the cough is of recent origin and the patient is strong, the treatment should be undertaken despite declaring it to be of the incurable type\" ( Caraka Samhita). The Potential Early Diagnosis: D iabetes was treated by ancient A yurvedic physicians through a series of medical drugs and lifestyle changes. This has great significance to PD due to the prevalence of Insulin resistance vi and Metabolic Syndrome playing a key factor in future dopamine receptors malfunction. This characteristic of PD plays a vital role in the cognitive and physiological deterioration of the day -to-day patient's quality of life. It is a known fact in the conte mporary clinical setting but in ancient time, it was a missed opportunity for an early diagnosis of PD. Although in ancient times there were up to 45 plants and their bioactive products which have shown to have a spectrum of hypoglycemic and anti -hyperglyc emic properties v. These plants included widely accessible and 7 household essentials such as allium cepa18, allium sativum19, and aloe vera such as cajanus cajan,20 capparis decidua,21 and several others. These plants were tested in a 2002 study by J.K Grover in rat models to see the direct potential antidiabetic properties, the results were truly astounding due to the active combating of IR through household ethnomedical approach v. Target Study: Mucuna Pruriens Isolation of levodopa from the seeds of Mucuna pruriens serves an important role in addressing the vital qu estion on how the metabolic breaking down of levodopa in the human body. The earliest evidence of the isolated form of L -DOPA from M. pruriens in 1937. There is a clear line of symptomatic support and neuroprotective properties associated with L -DOPA content from M. pruriens. Artificial synthesis of L -DOPA in a laboratory setting have shown to be fantastic in the therapeutic usage because it is pure and relatively controllable in dosage regulation with patients. The important aspect that is often forgotten is that with M. pruriens has shown to have a significantly higher anti -Parkinson's capacity. There is an increased mitochondrial complex -I activity and the production of endogenous22 amount of L -DOPA, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin level associa ted with catecholamine pathway23. The two specific molecules that are 18 Allium cepa : also known as onion 19 Allium sativum : also known as garlic 20 Cajanus cajan : also known as Pigeon pea 21 Capparis decidua : also known as Caper plant 22 Endogenous: having internal causes or origin which is typical within the organism. 23 Catecholamine pathway : The process by which a series of precursors are broken down into their functional parts. (i.e. Levodopa \u00bb Dopamine) 8 formulated from the mitochondrial Complex -I24 are NADH25 and the Co-Enzyme Q1026, which both have anti -oxidant properties27 and thus decreasing the chances of free radicals28 in the organic synthesis chains. Further evidence suggests that there are ot her bioactive properties such as n- propanol which has proven to be neuroprotective. Clinicians and medical researchers are aware of the complex nature of the delivery system of L -DOPA and the problems that arise from the intake of dopamine precursor. It is suggested by Hinz, M in a 2014 study that the natural inhibi tor of dopa decarboxylase due to carbidopa is also a secondary cause of nausea and reversible dyskinesia. But subsequent usage of the lab synthesized version of carbidopa or benserazide has shown to have irreversible dyskinesia. The cause of this was the binding and deactivation of vitamin B 6 this resulting in a serious compromising of enzymatic action and protein synthesis. The method used by the ancient clinicians circumvented this but purely applying M. Prureins through enemas and oral intake w hich allowed for the previously discussed neuroprotective properties to be present along with targeted levodopa crossing into to the hematoencephalic barrier29 (BBB) . The pharmacological breakdown of M. prureins shows that there is a high content of the nico tinic acid which has counter effects to the laboratory synthesized L -DOPA. This will be further explored in the next passage which will focus on the mechanism by which Ayurvedic medicine addressed Parkinson's Disease. 24 Mitochondrial Complex -I: is a primary mechanism for creating energy within an organism by producing several chemical compounds such as NADH and Co -Enzyme Q10. 25 NADH: (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) (C 21H27N7O14P2) plays a vital role in energy production in the mitochondrial complex. 26 Co-Enzyme Q10: (C89H90O4) also known as ubiquinone and serves a role of being an antioxidant and free radical 27 Antioxidant : serve a vital role of removing free radicals in the syste m which disrupt cell functions through degrading chain reaction. 28 Free radicals: is a chemical structure that has an unpaired valence electron which makes it highly reactive in the cellular functions of organisms. 29 Blood Brain Barrier : The semipermeable membrane barrier that separates the circulatory system and cerebral fluid which is tightly protected by endothelial cells which form tight junctions. 9 Allopathic Medicine and Ayurvedic Approach To appreciative true ingenuity of both contemporary and homeopathic medicine, there need to be some understanding of pharmacology and physiology of the human body. The primary medication in Ayurveda for 'Kampavata' is Mucuna prureins30 which contains 4% -6% of levodopa31 is primary precursor32 to neurotransmitters like dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine which are all structural catecholamine33 (one benzene ring and two hydroxyl tails) . [See Figure 3] As previously noted, dopamine in the substantia nigra controls the thalamus and motor complex indirectly. Patients with PD have degenerative dopaminergic neurons which are unable to produce dopamine necessary to counteract many of the symptoms. Furthermore, treatment of PD would involve direct injection of dopamine into the brain since dopamine is a charged which is not permeable through the blood- brain barrier. So, the natural choice for physicians would be to work with the precursor levodopa or commonly known as L -Dopa which can pass through the BBB34 and CNS35. Although in the peripher al blood system, levodopa , when administrated to the body , can be broke n down in the blood before reaching the brain. The two specific enzymes that break down L-Dopa are dopamine de carboxylase (D DC36) and Catechol -O- methyl transferase (COM T37) which results in an ineffectiveness of the medication. Furthermore, the side of effects of consuming a large amount of L -dopa results in nausea and severe vomiting which can result in patient eventually developing anorexia. The two reducing agents for these 30 Mucuna prureins : also known as 'kampavata' or velvet beans which are itchy to touch due to the serotonin in the surface but are good source of L -dopa. 31 L-dopa : the levorotatory form of dopa, used to treat Parkinson's disease. Also, called levodopa. 32 Precursors : a substance from which another is formed, especially by metabolic reaction. 33 Catecholamine : any of a class of aromatic amines that includes a number of neurotransmitters such as epinephrine and dopamine. 34 Blood Brain Barrier : The semipermeable membrane barrier that separates the circulatory system and cerebral fluid which is tightly protected by endothelial cells which form tight junctions. 35 CNS : Central Nervous System 36 Dopamine decarboxylase (DDC): catalyzes the conversion of amino acids into corresponding amines such the synthesis of dopamine and serotonin from L -DOPA and L -5-hydropxytrypotophan respectively. 37 Catechol -O-methyltransferase (COMT): part of couple of enzymes that degrade catecholamines (dopamine, epinephrine, etc.) 10 enzymes are C arbidopa (Benserazide in Europe) and COMT -inhibitor which allow for more L- dopa to pass through the blood brain barrier. Usually , COMT inhibitors are not given due to carbidopa infused levodopa (Sinemat) taking care of dopamine de carboxylase. [Figure 4] This is not a flawless system since the operational time between each dosage slowly decreases as time progresses. This is called the wearing off phenomena, this usually common manifestation with most neurological related treatment since inhibitors become insufficient and dosage amounts have to be increased to compensate. [Figure 5] The Ayurvedic approach to the same diagnosis involves making a powder ed Mucuna pruriens or atmagupta that contains a combination of natural seed extracts and the L -dopa. This naturally has same side effects as taking pure levodopa except with a muted side effects of nausea. Furthermore, atmagupta does not contain any tracea ble element of carbidopa which shows that small amount of L -dopa is handled well in patients in ancient practices . This has a domino effect on the wearing off symptoms being deterred for a longer stretch of time as compared to allopathic approach, which deals with 100- 250 mg per capsule with a combination 10-25 mg of carbidopa. Wearing off from this allopathic approach results in motor fluctuations as the levodopa breaks down in the system. A typical medi cal diagnosis for wearing off would result in the medical professional to change dosage and schedule cycles of administration . This is further supplemented inhibitors like MAO -I38 could prove quite effective when it comes dosage alteration between Carbidopa -Levodopa and Mucuna pruriens [Figure 6] . Although important to address that measurement of Mucuna pruriens is not easy unl ike the exact quantity of Sinemet (Carbidopa and Levodopa) medication due to the content of levodopa varying from 4% -6%. But it would be a study of interest to pursue in the future to see the application of an Ayurvedic to an allopathic could lead to a new breakthrough for treating wearing off phenomena . A more palatable approach 38 Monoamine Oxidase B : breaks down dopamine which inhibits the prolonged action of dopamine in the neuronal level. 11 is using Mucuna pruriens as an early treatmen t option when a patient is diagnosed with parkinsonism or PD . MAO- Inhibitors and COMT -Inhibitors can improve scores the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS39) and in Motor Cognitive Assessment (MoCA40). These baseline scores improved with early therapeutic usage but as the 5-6 year range is met by long time patients with Parkinson's Disease, there is a sharp drop in both scores of UPDRS III (Motor Examinations) and MoCA (cognitive and perception) . A Historical Review of Parkinson's Disease The first identifiable version of Parkinsoni sm or PD emerges in 600 BC with the official written form of the Charaka Samhita. Although according to oral traditions, there is evidence of diagnosis and treatment as early as 5000 -1000 BCE. [Figure 2] Much of the credit goes to the Rishi41 known as Atreya Punarvasu who converted the oral tradition of medicine to a written and systematic form. This opened up access to the world in terms of medical practices where traces of it can be found in middle eastern and Europe an philosophies of medicine. Although much of the hard copies of Atreya's medical literature is lost due to degradation of manuscripts, conquest, and translational efforts. Though the primary \"Samhit\" remain s understood due to the translational effort by the Indian government and private/public sponsorship. Rishi Atreya is credited also for establishing the original medical college in Indus Valley, about 1000 BCE, which rivals some of the medical schools and hospitals of modern day. This ancient medical institution is in many ways a body of work itself where the manuscripts, ancient physicians, and emerges of new diagnosis 39 UPDRS : Specific rating system used to track the progression in longitudinal manner for both clinical and research settings. 40 MoCA: A supplemental rating system used for variety of diagnosis including PD, relating to cognitive and mental capability of patients. 41 Rishi or Guru: is a modern word which is synonymous teacher of a certain knowledge or academic level, in vedic terms, an inspired poet of hymns. 12 occurred. Inarguably, this institution would have been the birth place of the first diagnosis of PD. This can be compared to the first We stern identification of Parkinson's which began with Claudius Galen . Galen was able to isolate the primary symptoms of resting tremors, gait cha nges, which followed paralysis but was unsure as to the aetiology of this condition. These observations on the emergence of PD were noted in the 2nd century CE. But the true lasting definition emerged on the \" An Essay on Shaking Palsy\" by Dr. James Parkinson in 1817. The essay and observation of Dr. Parkinson that took a structural natural history of the coined ter m \"Shaking Palsy\" which would eventually become known as Parkinson's Disease . Several other researcher s gave a better spectrum of this debilitating condition with works by Charcot and Gower in terms of physiological issues as well as deformities. Building on Charcot and Gower, the official metrics of PD occurred with the famous study of Hoehn and Yahr42 who gave the condition its various stages which appeared in 1967 publication. This scale is so universal and well adopted that it is used to this day by most physicians for quantifying the prog ression of PD. The first synthesis of dopamine began by G. Barger and J. Holtz which occurred in 1910. While first administration of levodopa began in 1961, but the medicine for treating PD was only starting to be refined due to several issues . As previously mentioned, the effectiv eness of lab synthesized or S -Levodopa and some acute side-effects made it difficult to adopt widely for patients. Furthermore, bioactive components could not effectively reac h the targeted part of the brain which resulted in higher dosages being administered. This feasible option only became available after the early 1970s when inhibitors of DOPA decarboxylase allowed for the treatment of levodopa. 42 Hoehn and Yah Scale : provided a universal metric for analyzing the stages of PD and its progress. (Stages 1 -5) 13 The clinical availability o ccurred shortly after with the commercial production of carbidopa/levodopa combination. Neuronal agonists found a trade mark location in modern- day physician practices due effectiveness, sustained usage, and the wearing off effect. [Figure 4] All of the sci entific advances now focus on several frontiers; Deep Brain Stimulation43 (DBS), Stem cells, and identifying earlier markers of this neurodegenerative condition. Current studies now focus on several early detection symptoms such anosmia, insulin resistance (IR), and cognitive decline. Several studies now focus on the Metabolic Syndrome44 (M-Syn) and Insulin Resistance45 (IR) in nondiabetic patients. The M -Syn plays a crucial role in the functionality of mitochondrial activity and the chronic inflammation response patients might feel. This coupled with a biochemical decrease in insulin functionality as shown to be significant in potentially diagnosing PD in advance. The evolution of PD according to most allopathic medical literature originates with Galen and Parkinson's discoveries but the practices of Ayurvedic Medicine contradicts these notions. During the course of time, PD has been noted and tr eated with various manifesting forms in the Indus Valley civilization. Although the knowledge of these practices has been long since eroded by time, conquest, and lack of translational capabilities. The evidence of these works has been noted in European ce ntric medical work due to the pass off the knowledge and craft during the establishment of the Asia -Euro trade systems. This can be seen by the Rishi Atreya who was able to establish a medical school in the early ages of civilization. The knowledge from this school 43 DBS : Typically, a permanent implanting of electrodes into the brain, targeting the Substantia Nigra, to alleviate the hallmark movement re lated issues in PD. 44 Metabolic Syndrome : grouped risk factors marked by high blood pressure, high blood glucose levels, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and high waist line. These factors play a role of many cardiovascular disease as well as neur ological. 45 IR: deals with a physiological or biochemical inability to process glucose due to denature or the loss of insulin functionality 14 encompassed a dynamic and systematic approach that rivals most contemporary hospital and teaching centers. The history of PD is rich with not only the advances in medicine but has key figures who have shaped global and historical foundations of medical humanities . Several historical figures had or are dia gnosed with PD including Mohamme d Ali, Billy Graham, Janet Reno, Charles M. Schulz and many others. One key figure, Michael J. Fox (actor) established an entire foundation in 2000 for research a nd clinical initiatives to help speed along the cure for PD. These figures have used PD as a platform for global advocacy and scientific initiatives. Thus , the significance of PD has been established and its effect on modern day culture and history is firm ly integrated . Discussion Ayurvedic medicine defined by principles from both allopathic and homeopathic medicine due to its approach in treating patients holistically. This form of medical practice is rooted deeply in a multidisciplinary and strategic approach to patient care and treatment. Key examples of this form of care are seen with the diverse arsenal by which ancient and modern- day physicians treat PD. The forefronts of PD research involve the address of three vital points; preventative care, ea rly diagnosis/management, and potential solutions/cure. Ayurvedic Medicine address these points through the treatment of presymptomatic conditions and management of PD through the usage of herbology. This can be seen by which ancient physicians crafted a t reatment plan that involved \"vih ra, 46\" \"hra,47\" and \"bhesaja.48\" These plans involved the building of lifestyle plan, dietary support in order to maximize bioactive entities and the prescription of drugs by a practicing 46 Vihara: regimens (modern translation of medical treatment plans) 47 hra: dietary treatment plan 48 Bhesaja: (Dru gs) Concocted combination of plants, minerals/vitamins, and other bioactive agents in forming drugs 15 physician. This is similar to contem porary physicians treating PD by address lifestyle struggles, implementation drugs , and dietary restrictions or supplements. Thus, the management and treatment of PD has been historically present for countless of years starting from 1000 BCE. This shifts t he narratives by which philosophical the viewpoint of Hippocrates, Galen, and even Parkinson become less revolutionary but rather evolutionary. The description of the anosmia as a diagnostic tool and the previous treatment of patients with IR suggest s that map of PD was being cleared up far before the modern era. These factors suggest that the road to an official diagnosis of PD begins with several influences deal with issues that deal with poor health outcomes and chronic ailments. Focusing on the treatmen t plan involving levodopa (LD), the use of mucuna pr urines iii was widely adopted as the baseline for treating kampavata or PD in ancient timesi. Certain enzymatic factors such need to boost mitochondrial function such as NADH and Coenzyme Q10 have helped facilitate the uptake of LD across the BBB. Although the running hypothesis in this paper suggests certain other factors are co -promoting the natural uptake of LD. Especially in terms of effectivity Natural LD has better uptake and sustained release time as compared to a clinical synthesized version or S -LD. According to previous studies , the effectivity of N -LD lasts up to 30 mins longer at equivalent dosages ix. This is suggestive of potential bioactive and chemical properties that allow a greater receptiv ity in LAT receptors49. Furthermore, the lack of commonly used carbidopa, MAOB -I, and agonists suggests that ancient practitioners had figured out how to facilitate effective administering of dopamine into the brain. This evident usage produces a questiona ble line of regarding what the potentiality of mucuna pr urines and what biochemically rich properties it holds. Further studies definitely need 49 LAT Receptors : (L-Amino Acid Transport) serves as the pathway for the administered levodopa to cross the BBB in order support neuronal functionality. 16 to be conducted to isolate organic compound or compounds that play a significant role in the treatment of Parkin son Dise ase. A potential line of inquiry must look at the retrospective usage of these mucuna legumes which were used with several ingredient s for ancient clinical regiments. Potential factors include plants and legumes such as Aswagandha ( a comprehensive literature and translational efforts must be undertaken in order to restore much of the vernacular herbology and treatment plans to current clinical kno wledge and research inquiries. From this analysis, the hallmark of medical knowledge and humanities can be updated to reflect the historical significance of Ayurvedic medicine and many other diverse forms of holistic sciences. Conclusion The use of ethnomedical approaches is a growing health trend in the modern era since holistic medicine address several areas with a combined effort in lifestyle management, treatment, and potential cure. Especially in terms of this paper, it is easy to see how PD has typically been marked with an arduous battle with a rapid on setting neurodegenerative condition. Thus, Ayurvedic medicine serves a role in not only retrospectively reviewing ancient practices but also potential areas of exploration and research. This paper expands the medical timeline or natural history of this condition in hopes of encouraging future research into the bioactive factors in levodopa treatment plan and potential cures for PD. This paper is a living testament to combining a scientific and hu manities -based approach to medicine and clinical research. The significance of Ayurvedic medicine and other holistic forms serve in pushing the boundaries of an interdisciplinary field of medical humanities. 17 It serves a role of combining the fields of hist ory, medicine, biochemistry, herbology, public health, and neuroscience in an effort of to show how Ayurvedic medicine can be much more than an ancient medical knowledge. The suggested approach of combining Ayurvedic medicine and contemporary allopathic ap proach would be to the combined effort. An early diagnosis of PD would follow an initial treatment with an Ayurvedic regiment, in order to explore more invasive options in the later stages of PD with allopathic treatment. This ideal scenario would lower th e immune response due to more natural remedies as compared to initial high dosages of medication. I want to conclude by stating that the information present in this paper serves as a point of knowledge rather than a prescribed method since approached must be safely regulated by a specialist. The manifesting forms of PD are very much varied from patient to patient thus an approach must be tailored to each individual. Thus, this work is reflective of a scholarly review rather than a prescribed methodology for treatment of PD. 18 References i. Dev, S. (1999). Ancient -Modern Concordance, 107(10), 783-789.
