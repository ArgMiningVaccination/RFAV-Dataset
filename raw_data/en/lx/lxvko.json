The meandering paths at SpIN aren't running or conquer-the-mountain hiking trails; these paths are for spiritual fitness. Signs with quotations, some from religious texts and traditional teachings, others from scientists, poets, philosophers and an architect, broaden our understanding of the natural world and our role in it. They place the current state of our lives and of the world into the context of the timelessness represented by the forest, the river, the sky, and the seasons. LAND ACKNOWLEDGMENT The Spirit In Nature Sanctuary sits on land which has served as a site of meeting and exchange among indigenous peoples since time immemorial. The Western Abenaki are the traditional caretakers of these Vermont lands and waters, which they call Ndakinna, or \"homeland.\" We acknowledge and honor their connection to this region, and their continuing contributions. We give thanks for the opportunity to share in the bounty of this place and to protect it. We are all one in the sacred web of life that connects people, animals, plants, air, water, and earth. [SpIN Board of Trustees, April 2022] SpIN is free and open to the public; all are welcome. Donations are accepted with thanks, as SpIN is a non-profit, but are not a requirement. HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR THE PUBLIC Accessibility: The paths at SpIN are not wheelchair accessible, due to their uneven terrain, narrow width, and multiple tree roots. We recommend the Robert Frost Interpretive Trail, on Route 125 less than a mile east of SpIN, which is 100% accessible. [SpIN Board of Trustees, April 2022] Dogs: If you decide to walk your dogs here, please keep them on leash at all times, and remove any dog waste from the property. [SpIN Board of Trustees, June 2023] Fires and Campfires: Campfires are not allowed on SpIN land. Fires in the Sacred Circle may be allowed for SpIN-authorized events; contact SpIN in advance. No Cellphone / Mobile Phone Service on SpIN land: Your cellphone / mobile phone will not receive service at SpIN. Thus, do not rely on this mode of communication when walking our paths, or in any emergency. SpIN land and connection with Middlebury College The land in Ripton where SpiN resides is owned by Middlebury College. Middlebury College representatives confirmed in May 2021 that the SpIN land will NOT be included in any \"land swap\" with the United States Forest Service. SpIN operates under license from Middlebury College, maintaining its autonomy and its inclusive spiritual/religious approach to the world of nature.
