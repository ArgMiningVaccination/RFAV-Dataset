Is the COVID vaccine safe for heart stent patients? 2 Answers [Behzad Taghizadeh](/Expert/1541635-Behzad-Taghizadeh)Cardiologist Winston Salem, NC There is no issues with getting Covid vaccine in a patient with coronary artery stent. [Dr. Allan Stewart](/Expert/1197101-Allan-Stewart)Thoracic Surgeon MIAMI, FL The honest truth is that its is too early to tell. Certainly, there have been adverse effects with the vaccine including myocarditis (inflammation of the heart) and increased clotting. Both of these issue seem to be transient and not life-threatening. However, in patients with stents, increased clotting could be a devastating complication. The risk/benefit of the vaccine should be considered in each patient, at this point. COVID, while still present, does not appear to be the life threatening virus that griped the world during the past few years. If I were to advise an individual heart stent patient, I would be sure to tell them to take their anti-platelet medicine (aspirin and Plavix or Brillinta) before, during, and for at least a month after vaccination. I would also advise any heart patient to reduce the likelihood of severe COVID by maintaining an appropriate weight, making exercise a routine part of life, and taking supplemental vitamin D (deficiency was shown to be associate with more severe illness).
