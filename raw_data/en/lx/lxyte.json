Welcome to our online booking site Traditional Chinese Medicine & Acupuncture [Read More](1-description) Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a system of holistic mind/body/spirit wellness rooted in evidence-based science with more than 5000 years of history. While TCM is very effective in treating acute conditions, it excels at uncovering patterns of disease and treating root causes of illness. Complex and chronic illness often manifests from underlying disharmony that unfortunately Western Medicine sometimes misses or does not effectively address. TCM can provide understanding, realistic hope, and life-changing treatment for patients who may have exhausted other available treatments. The goal of Traditional Chinese Medicine is to re-establish balance, to enable your body to heal itself. Traditional Chinese Medicine has been shown to very effective in treating and assisting: pain conditions, arthritis, shoulder/joint/rotator cuff inflammation and injuries, repetitive stress injury, insomnia, stress, anxiety, headaches & migraines, hormonal balance, menopause and perimenopausal difficulties, menstrual and gynecological conditions, fibromyalgia, fatigue, stroke sequelae, neurological conditions, auto-immune disorders, seasonal allergies & asthma, skin conditions, flu, common cold, cough, bronchial and viral infections, post-viral fatigue and long-COVID, mental health, depression, PTSD and nervous system dysregulation, digestive complaints, hypertension, respiratory conditions, establishing new habits & supporting change, support during treatment for cancer and other serious illness, circulatory issues, relaxation, overall wellness and vitality, health maintenance, disease prevention ... and more. Modalities of TCM: ACUPUNCTURE: Acupuncture is the insertion of very thin sterile needles at strategic points along fascial planes of the body, to influence qi/energy, blood, and fluid movement in the physical and etheric body. Within the context of Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture can effect subtle yet profound change, well beyond the pain relief of \"dry needling\" that one might receive from other qualified practitioners such as chiropractors, naturopaths, and physiotherapists. When performed by a Registered Acupuncturist, Acupuncture is covered by many Canadian insurance policies. 1.

ACUPRESSURE FOR RELAXATION is a 60-minute full body & facial relaxation treatment. Acupressure utilizes moving, comfortable pressure on strategic areas and points of the body. Acupressure can be indicated for patients who are hesitant about needles or for whom acupuncture is contraindicated. Deep relaxation results from harmonizing qi and blood flow throughout the body. ANCIENT TCM THERAPIES - including Moxibustion, Fire Cupping, Gua-sha, and Tui-na: Ancient TCM therapies are offered individually as 30-minute targeted/acute treatments (particularly effective for acute pain or illness or for ongoing support) or as 60-minute comprehensive treatments, utilizing any combination of these ancient therapies: MOXIBUSTION is an ancient method of heating specific points on the body by burning a small bundle of specially dried mugwort herb close to or on the skin. Moxibustion can help bring warmth and movement deep into tissues. FIRE CUPPING is the therapeutic use of heated glass cups to move stagnation in the body. It can be very effective in treating tight muscles by lifting the fascia to create more space for muscles to relax. Fire cupping can be used very effectively to manage qi and blood flow, address inflammation, and to expel pathogens. GUA-SHA is the use of specialized stone tools to stimulate micro-circulation of the soft tissue to increase qi & blood flow, address inflammation and edema, and to expel pathogens. TUI-NA is Chinese Medical Massage. It is often used for pain relief. Chiropractic [Read More](2-description) One of the largest primary care professions, chiropractic is an evidence-informed, non-invasive, hands-on health care discipline that focuses on the neuromusculoskeletal system. Chiropractors practice primarily using their hands, providing diagnosis, treatment and preventive care for disorders related to the spine, pelvis, nervous system and other joints. Chiropractors use a combination of treatments, depending on the specific needs of the individual patient. After taking a history, performing an examination and establishing a diagnosis, a chiropractor can develop and carry out a comprehensive treatment/management plan, recommend therapeutic exercise and other non-invasive therapies, and provide nutritional and lifestyle counselling. One of the most common therapies a chiropractor uses is adjusting, which can comprise a variety of techniques. Specific training allows chiropractors to provide highly-skilled and precise adjustments to the vertebrae of the spine and other joints, correcting joint motion to restore proper movement and improve function. For many conditions, such as low back pain, chiropractic care is the primary method of treatment. When a multi-disciplinary approach is advisable, a chiropractor will coordinate care with other health care professionals. Where other conditions exist, chiropractic care may complement or support medical or other treatment by relieving the musculoskeletal aspects associated with the condition. Chiropractic care may also be used to provide symptomatic relief for patients with chronic conditions. There are many reasons to seek chiropractic care: Back pain, Neck pain, Headache, Whiplash, Strains and sprains, Repetitive strain injury (RSI), Work and sports injuries, Arthritis, Limited range of motion in the back, shoulder, neck or limbs, Various pediatric conditions, and most patients continue simply to stay active and thrive. Chiropractic is a regulated health profession, recognized by statute in all Canadian provinces and American states. Millions of patients rely on chiropractic care every year to help them live healthy, active lives. Massage Therapy Massage therapy is the manipulation of soft tissues of the body including, muscles, connective tissues, tendons, ligaments and joints. Massage Therapy is a clinically oriented healthcare option that helps alleviate the discomfort associated with everyday and occupational stresses, muscular over-use and many chronic pain conditions. Reflexology [Read More](7-description) A natural, non-invasive holistic therapy that works by applying pressure to reflex areas on the feet (and hands) to help restore balance to the corresponding systems of the body, by encouraging your body's own self-healing process -- there are over 7,000 nerve ending in each foot! The mental, emotional, and even spiritual aspects of a person are always involved in the disease process, as well as the process of recovering well-being -- the healing process; therefore, treating only the symptoms does not fix the issue; the whole body must be treated in order to relieve the symptoms, restore wellness, and return to positive health -- and reflexology treats the whole body! Reiki [Read More](8-description) Reiki is an ancient holistic healing technique that involves the practitioner channeling Universal Life Force Energy (that's all around us) by using the hands directly on or above the body in various positions. It assists the natural healing process of the body, enhancing its ability to re-balance to a healthier state. During a treatment, the body draws in the energy to relieve itself of physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual blocks. Holistic Nutrition [Read More](9-description) Holistic nutrition takes into account the concept that we are all complex beings - mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually; our entire body works as a whole system and all systems are interconnected -- so when something is wrong in one part of our body, it will affect the entire body In terms of health and wellness, and specifically holistic nutrition, the approach is based on individual needs, and not \"one-size-fits-all\", and finding the root cause of any health concerns The one critical component is the client's active participation -- it is ultimately the client who holds the key to his/her own health and well-being! -- a process of empowerment occurs as one takes responsibility for him/herself by making changes necessary to become healthier and more balanced Holistic nutrition is based on eating healthy food as close to its natural state as possible for optimum health and well-being -- unrefined, unprocessed, organic, and locally grown whole foods (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds) Consideration of individual needs, combined with nutrient-dense whole foods and lifestyle recommendations, help one come back to a state of balance / homeostasis / equilibrium.
