When reducing carbohydrates by replacing them with fats, this helps your body enter a metabolic state, called ketosis. Well, some folks decide to go on a tweaked version of the ketogenic dietary regimen, known as the dirty keto diet. So, what is dirty keto? The dirty keto diet involves decreasing your carbs and increasing your fats intake, but without any considerations for the quality of food you consume. It allows processed and fast foods, as well as prepackeged snacks. The dirty keto diet is more flexible and less costly than the clean keto diet. However, it can lead to some adverse health effects. Although the dirty keto diet differs from the clean keto, it still helps you burn your body's stored fats. Dirty keto involves consuming around 65-70% fat calories daily, 10% carbohydrates, and 25-30% proteins. Key Takeaways: Dirty keto follows the main principle of the ketogenic regimen, which comes down primarily to focusing on the ratio of the macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins and fats) you consume.

You can consume processed foods, fast foods, drinks, together with healthier foods, as long as they fit your macros. Therefore, dirty keto foods may include sugar-free cookies, sweets and chocolate, soft drinks with artificial sweeteners, low-carb chips, keto-friendly prepackeged snacks, processed meats and dairy, and cheap-to-procuce oils.
