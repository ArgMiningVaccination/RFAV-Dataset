ASM Calls on Congress and the Administration To: Continue investments within and among key US agen-cies to build on the science and ensure that new and emerging infectious dis-eases are addressed with evidence-based, preventive measures like vaccines. Partner with scientific societies, like ASM, in supporting basic and clinical research and pro-moting evidence-based poli-cies that support immunization regimens recommended by public health agencies.Substantially increase in-vestments in education and outreach efforts to provide evidence-based messages on vaccines to the public. Support H.R. 2862, the VACCINES Act, and similar provisions included in S. 1895.ASM strongly supports the universal application of vaccines to prevent illness and death caused by infectious diseases. Thanks to federal investments in basic and clinical research, there is a sound evidence-based foundation for U.S. immunization strategies. The development and effective use of vaccines for a broad range of life-threatening illnesses has saved countless lives in our nation and around the world. US Government Role: A Multi-Agency Effort The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ensures the safety, effectiveness, and availability of vaccines in the United States. Before the FDA approves a vaccine, it is tested extensively by its manufacturer. FDA scientists and medical professionals care-fully evaluate all the available information about the vaccine to determine its safety and effectiveness. Although most common side effects of a vaccine are identified in studies before the vaccine is licensed, rare adverse events may not be detected in these studies. There-fore, the U.S. vaccine safety system continuously monitors for adverse events after a vaccine is licensed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tracks vaccine use and ed-ucates consumers on vaccines. Education materials are targeted for both domestic and global audiences, with printable fact sheets accessible on CDC's website. CDC's cooperative agreements also support the New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN). The Network includes study sites that focus on population-based surveillance and data collection on the use and impact of vaccines and the effect of vaccine policies. Researchers at the Department of Defense's (DoD) Walter Reed Army Institute of Re-search, develop vaccines aimed at saving military and civilian lives. DOD researchers de-veloped the first effective licensed vaccine against meningitis in the 1970s, and have tested vaccines for Ebola and Zika in recent years. The National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) conducts and supports basic research in areas such as infectious diseases, microbiology, and immunology to generate the knowledge essential for developing safe and effective vaccines. NIAID also supports clinical research on vaccines against bacterial, viral and parasitic microbes in people of all ages and risk categories. The Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) at the Department of Agriculture (USDA) is responsible for regulating veterinary biologics, including vaccines, that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of animal diseases. Most vaccines are generally covered as a preventive service with no cost sharing (such as copays and deductibles) for the beneficiary with private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid. "}
