Th is is one of the biggest questions you face as a person with MS. Not so long ago, you wouldn't have had a choice. Your doctor would have decided for you from a limited list of possibilities. But today there are several ways to manage MS and a long list of ways to ease MS symptoms. In order to understand and evaluate your options, and manage your MS over time, you need to be an active, informed consumer. Th is is particularly important if you choose to pursue an alternative or complementary therapy. Here, it is much harder to identify and evaluate the risks and bene ts. Th erapies range from the widely accepted to the truly bizarre. To protect your health and your pocketbook, you must track down and scrutinize information from as many sources as possible. What are alternative therapies? Th e term alternative is di cult to de ne. When applied to health care, it encompasses everything from drugs and diets to food supplements, mental exercises, hands-on techniques, and lifestyle changes\u2014virtually anything not connected with traditional Western medical practice. Alternative therapies come from many disciplines and traditions. Th ey include acupuncture, aromatherapy, biofeedback, chiropractic, guided imagery, herbal medicine, homeopathy, hypnosis, hypnotherapy, macrobiotics, naturopathy, refl exology, relaxation techniques, traditional Chinese medicine, yoga, \"therapeutic touch,\" and various schools of massage, among others. Alternative treatments may have no clear relation to what medical science knows about the cause of a particular disease or its symptoms. Despite this lackof scienti c rationale, alternative medicine appeals to many Americans. biofeedbac k, chiropractic, guided imagery, herbal Eric, diagnosed in 1951.4 CLEAR THINKING ABOUT ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 5 STAYING WELLUnfortunately, there is plenty to lose. Health, money, hopes\u2014even one's life. Th at's why we've prepared this booklet. We believe information can help youchoose intelligently. Separating fact from ction Th ere are many misconceptions about alternative medicine. Here are some of the most common. Fiction: Alternative medicine is completely natural a nd nontoxic. Fact: Not all alternative therapies use natural s ubstances. And even a natural substance can be toxic. Remember, poison ivy is completely natural. Fiction: Alternative medicine is non-invasive and pa inless. Fact: Some alternative therapies are invasive, painful, a nd may produce serious side e ects. Examples include chelation therapy, colonic irrigation, and bee sting therapy. Fiction: Alternative medicine is risk-free. Fact: Every test, treatment, therapy, and medication\u2014 wh ether conventional or alternative\u2014carries some degree of risk. Th e question is, do the bene ts outweigh the risks? Only well-conducted, scienti c studies or documented clinical experience can determine this. However, the experience of a seasoned MS clinician can provide valuable guidance.Advocates of alternative therapies sometimes claim that conventional medicine is ignoring or suppressing treatments that can alleviate symptoms or even curesome diseases. Opponents of alternative therapies maintain that conventional medicine adopts whatever therapies can be proven safe and e ective. Th ey challenge the advocates of unproven treatments to produce the scienti c evidence that will substantiate their claims. Why is it so popular? People want to believe that someone, somewhere, has the answer\u2014or, at least, part of the answer. It's not hard to understand why. Th e inability of conventional medicine to cure certain illnesses or alleviate symptoms can be deeply frustrating. In addition, people want to take responsibility for their own well-being. People with chronic diseases are often urged by their conventional health-care advisors to take a \"wellness\" approach to living with their disease. Th ey are urged to improve their diet, exercise regularly, and take steps to support their emotional well-being. It is a short step from this to alternative therapies. In fact, the distinction is very blurred. If an alternative treatment appears to be harmless, many people feel it's worth a try. Perhaps you agree. \"What do I have to lose?\" you may ask.6 CLEAR THINKING ABOUT ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 7 STAYING WELL Fiction: If a person improves while using a t reatment, that means it works. Fact: It's always good news when someone's condition i mproves. However, the improvement may be due to the natural course of the disease, not to the treatment. MS particularly is notorious for being variable. It can stabilize for no known reason at any time. Or, the placebo e ect may be responsible for the improvement. (See page 11 for more informationon this.) Fiction: Conventional medicine has all the answers. Fact: No. Conventional medicine has not fully e valuated many of the treatments it currently uses. Doctors do not always know how or why some treatments work, but they use them anyway. However, reputable professionals avoid secrecy, and share information about their practices via journals, professional meetings, and correspondence. Fiction: Conventional physicians reject alternative me dicine. Fact: Today, the term c omplementary medicine is used by mainstream physicians for alternative regimens or therapies chosen by their patients. Th ese therapies complement but do not replace the conventional treatment plan. A growing number of physicians are interested in this approach. Some MDs refer patients to alternative medical practitioners. Some even administer complementary treatments themselves. And a few non-conventional therapies, such as meditation, have been tested, found to have some positive e ects, and are accepted by mainstream medicine. Fiction: Alternative medicine is inexpensive and p rotects people from pro teering corporations. Fact: It is possible to spend hundreds of thousands o f dollars on alternative medicine. Th e nutritional supplement business alone is a multimillion dollar industry, with rms both large and small vigorously marketing their products. 8 CLEAR THINKING ABOUT ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 9 STAYING WELLhis stress/recovery exercise program called Superesonant Wavenergy (SRWE) would correct imbalances in the immune system and cure multiple sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, and other chronic and fatal illnesses. When we met, I believed Dardik's enthusiastic assertion that he had the answer to MS. He emphasized he was not talking about a remission; he could cure me. It would take a year and I would walk again. My family gave in to my plea to pay this man $100,000-$50,000 of it up front. Within seven months, my condition deteriorated. Dr. Irving I. Dardik's worthless cure and greed had taken a year of my life that I could not afford to lose. I had to quit my job, I needed 24-hour nursing care, and I now used a wheelchair full-time. Dardik offered no restitution. In July 1995, based on my complaint, the New York State Administrative Review Board for Professional Medical Conduct upheld a hearing committee's decision to revoke Dardik's medical license in New York State. There was also a penalty ne of $40,000. While there are honest and honorable people who offer alternative medical treatments, there are too many charlatans who will prey on your desperation to be cured of MS. Please be careful! Please Be Careful by Ellen Burstein MacFarlaneThe diagnosis of MS is a shattering experience. This disease is unpredictable, the prognosis a question mark. While medicine can alleviate symptoms and, in some cases, slow progression, there is, as yet, no cure. I want to warn you that MS can make you desperate, and desperation makes you vulnerable\u2014an easy target for snake-oil salesmen selling false hope and phony cures. I know. I was a victim.In 1986, I was working as an investigative consumer reporter for WCPX-TV in Orlando, Florida, when I learned I had a slow, progressive form of MS. In my job, I warned the public about bad people and bad deals, and I thought I knew every con. But illness isa great leveler. By 1991, my MS had become severe and progres- sive, and I was struggling to stay on my feet. As my condition deteriorated, so did my judgment. I rst learned of Dr. Irving I. Dardik when a well- respected magazine did a nine-page cover story on him. Dardik, an impeccably credentialed vascular surgeon and former head of the Olympic Committee's Sports Medicine Council, claimed 10 CLEAR THINKING ABOUT ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 11 STAYING WELLHow is alternative medicine different from conventional medicine? Conventional medicine quanti es the risks and bene ts of a new treatment. Before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves any new drug or medical device, it must be proved safe and e ective in controlled clinical trials. People are protected by disclosure require-ments such as package inserts in prescription drugs and \"informed consent\" procedures. People who use an alternative therapy usually have little or no idea of the risks. Th ere is little published documentation to substantiate claims. What is available may be unreliable. Claims that alternative treatments work are often based on anecdotal evidence. An anecdote is a story about individual experience. It typically has not been measured against baselines or checkpoints to assure objectivity. Many alternative therapies simply do not stand up to scienti c scrutiny. For example, herbal preparations, sold as nutritional supplements, have until now been only lightly regulated by FDA rules. Fortunately, the FDA established new regulations in 2007 for the manufacture of nutritional supplements. Th ese regulations, which will be phased in by 2010, are designed to ensure that nutritional supplements are produced in a quality manner, without contaminants or impurities, and are accurately labeled so that the consumer can be sure of the contents. The controlled clinical trial Most clinical trials divide participants into two groups. One group gets the experimental treatment, the other gets a placebo , a look-alike but inactive treatment. Or they receive a standard, already proven treatment. In the most reliable clinical trials, neither patients nor researchers know who is receiving which treatment to prevent bias from creeping in. Th is kind of study allows researchers to separate the response to the test agent from responses produced by what is called the placebo e ect. Th is refers to bene ts caused by a patient's or a researcher's expectations about a treatment rather than by the treatment itself. 1111111 SSTSTSAYAAYYYAYYININININININNINNININNNNININNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGG GGGGGG GGGGG GGG G WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWEWEWEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWLLLLLLLLLLL12 CLEAR THINKING ABOUT ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 13 STAYING WELLYou can't assume that a therapy works just because it is currently undergoing clinical trials. It may well be proven ine ective. In fact, only a small percentage of products that undergo clinical trials ever gain FDA approval. Doing better research on alternatives In 1992, the U.S. National Institutes of Health established the O ce of Alternative Medicine to fund research on the safety and e ectiveness of alternative therapies. Th is o ce is now the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( www.nccam.nih.gov/research ). It awards grants to researchers in educational and research institutions around the country. Individuals can enroll on their site for a quarterly newsletter, \"CAM at the NIH.\" Belief\u2014a potent medicine Our bodies respond to suggestion. Some scientists think that a person's belief in a therapy causes the body to produce hormones called endorphins which act as natural pain-killers. Th is may ease pain and reduce discomfort. In other words, believing can literally make it so, at least for a time. Th e catch is that the placebo e ect diminishes over time even when the person's belief remains strong.About 32% of people in clinical trials respond to placebos, according to a groundbreaking 1955 study by H.K. Beecher. He was not studying MS. Experience in clinical trials for MS suggests the e ect is even stronger in this disease. Up to 60% of people with MS have responded to an inert drug look-alike\u2014at least for a short while. Th e power of suggestion can be a powerful tool to improve the quality of life for many people with MS. But it can also lead people to believe that an expensive and ultimately useless treatment is essential. (See pages 8-9 for Ellen Burstein MacFarlane's story.) Special issues in MS Clinical trials are particularly important in establishing the safety and e ectiveness of new treatments for MS. MS is a disease famous for spontaneous remissions. So much is still unknown about this disease, and its course can be so di erent from one person to another, that it can be di cult to determine what works and what doesn't. Th us a new MS therapy is tested on a large number of people with similar forms of MS over a long period of time. Th e results give information that assures everyone that the treatment is likely to do more good than harm. How to think for yourself Some alternative treatments may improve general health. Others could trigger a helpful placebo e ect, if only for a limited time. Others are ine ective for MS, and still others are actually dangerous. So how can you tell the good from the bad? How do you know what to avoid and what might be worth a try? 14 CLEAR THINKING ABOUT ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 15 STAYING WELLcancer, arthritis, heart attacks, strokes, MS, and Parkinson's disease. Evaluation: Th e Food and Drug Administration, the Veterans Administration, and other professional associations call chelation therapy worthless for purposes other than heavy metal accumulation. Th ere is no evidence that MS is caused by heavy metals in the bloodstream. Risks/Costs: Th e therapy carries signi cant risk. It can cause kidney damage and is potentially lethal without adequate supervision. A course of treatment extending over several months can cost thousands of dollars. Removal of mercury-based llings \u2014Ineffective Description: Dental llings made of silver and mercury amalgam are removed and replaced. Proponents claim that mercury leaks from amalgam llings and damages the immune system, causing a broad range of problems, including MS. Evaluation: Th ere is no scienti c evidence to connect the development of MS with mercury-based dental llings. Poisoning with heavy metals, such as mercury, lead, or manganese, can damage the nervous system and produce symptoms, such Th e answer: Gather information (see checklist on page 24). Carefully and thoroughly inquire about any therapy you are considering. Keep asking questions until you get the answers you need. Th is is the only way to fully understand what you are getting into. What does the treatment involve? How and why is it supposed to work? How e ective is it? What are the risks? How much does it cost? Three sample therapies, analyzed Here is the bottom line on three therapies that have been promoted for use by people with MS: Chelation therapy \u2014Ineffective and dangerous Description: Chelation means \"the process of combining with and dissolving.\" A crystalline acid (EDTA) is injected intravenously over several hours. It chelates, or binds, heavy metals in the bloodstream, which are then excreted through the kidneys. Chelation is accepted therapy for lead poisoning and a few very rare disorders involving heavy metal accumulation. It is advocated by some alternative practitioners as a treatment for diseases as diverse as 16 CLEAR THINKING ABOUT ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 17 STAYING WELLas tremor or weakness, similar to those seen in MS. However, the underlying mechanism of the nerve damage is completely di erent from MS. Risks/Costs: Although it can be painful and might cause dental complications, the procedure is medically harmless. However, it is usually very expensive. Tai chi \u2014Harmless and may bene t general health Description: Tai chi is an ancient Chinese system of meditative exercise. Th e participant concentrates on performing gentle patterns of movement that are described as bringing the body and mind into harmony. Tai chi is practiced by people of every age and physical condition. Evaluation: Tai chi may lower stress, promote relaxation, relieve fatigue, and improve balance. Risks/Costs: Th e exercises are safe. If necessary, they can be done in modi ed form from a seated position. Th e only costs are for instruction in a class or for a video.Danger signals! Alternative medicine attracts many quacks and frauds. Th ey claim their treatments can produce miracles. Quacks may be well intentioned and deeply convinced about the value of their remedy\u2014or they may be crooks, plain and simple. Either way, fraud produces misery in the form of wasted money, dashed hopes, and even direct physical harm. Suspect fraud if: Promoters suggest an alternative treatment is a \"cure\" for MS. Th e grander the claim, the more alarming this signal is. You must pay in advance. Th e treatment is available from only one source or works by a \"secret\" formula. A practitioner does not want to work with your medical doctor. Th e promoters claim there is a medical or scienti c conspiracy against them. Advertising uses testimonials from \"satis ed customers.\" Th e product or treatment is promoted by: > telephone solicitation, direct mail, or the Internet > a TV infomercial that uses a talk-show format > newspaper ads designed to look like news articles > a salesperson working for a multilevel marketing o rganization (known as \"pyramid marketing\") cks s ey r en 18 CLEAR THINKING ABOUT ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 19 STAYING WELLLook before you leap Don't make your decision in a vacuum. Contact a variety of sources to get reliable, objective information about any alternative therapy you are considering. Begin by calling the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at 1-800-FIGHT-MS (1-800-344-4867). And use the resources on pages 20-23. Discuss the alternative therapy with your doctor. Ask for your doctor's views on the risks, bene ts, side e ects, and potential interactions with medications you are currently taking. Also ask about the experience of other patients who have used the same therapy. A frank talk with your nurse may be helpful if you run into communication problems. Find out if the alternative practitioner works with conventional doctors. Be sure that the practitioner is willing to refer patients to a physician. Avoid those who do not want to work with regular doctors. Talk to people who have used the treatment. Firsthand knowledge is invaluable. Ask people who have used the therapy about its advantages, disadvantages, risks, side e ects, costs, and the results they got from it. Try to track down these people yourself. Chat groups like those on MSWorld\u00ae can be helpful here. Don't rely on references supplied by an alternative practitioner or a person who is trying to sell you a product or service. Investigate the background of any treatment provider. Find out about the person's training and credentials. In particular, determine how much experience this person has had treating peoplewith MS. Th oroughly investigate any clinic that requires inpatient stays. Be particularly vigilant about any clinic (in the U.S. or abroad) that will not treat you as an outpatient. Find out why they require inpatient treatment. Determine the costs. Ask about the cost for a full course of treatment. Some alternative therapies are very expensive and most are not covered by health insurance. Proceed with caution If you do decide to try an alternative therapy, continue to use your common sense. Do not abandon your conventional therapy. One of the greatest dangers of alternative medicine is quitting conventional treatment in a headlong rush to embrace an alternative. Only use alternative therapy in addition to, not in place of, treatment prescribed by a quali ed physician. Document your experience. Keep a detailed log of your experience. Record whom you consulted, what you took or did, and what changes you observed. A log will help you keep your doctor informed. Keep your doctor up to date. Tell your doctor about all the therapies you are using. A physician who can't see the whole picture will be practicing medicine in the 20 CLEAR THINKING ABOUT ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES 21 STAYING WELLdark. Your doctor can alert you to possible side e ects or interactions with your medications. He or she can also help you decide whether to continue a particular alternative therapy. A nal word Stay tuned for further developments. New ndings are now common in the fast-moving world of modern medicine. An alternative therapy that you've considered using may be proven harmful. On the other hand, some age-old folk remedy may prove to be the source for anew treatment. Th e best advice: Remain open-minded but skeptical. Remember, every alternative treatment is suspect until it has been proven safe and e ective.
