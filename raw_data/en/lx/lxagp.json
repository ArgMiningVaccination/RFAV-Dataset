Copper (Tamra) is one such metal, used to prepare a bhasma, called \"Tamra Bhasma\" (TB) which is claimed to cure various diseased conditions. Though bhasmas are prepared since centuries, the exact mechanism of conversion of metal to its bhasma, especially by the use of modern scientific tools is not established. Here is an attempt to prepare TB as per the text \"Ayurved Sar Sangraha\" and analyze the stepwise changes in terms of chemistry. TB was prepared from the copper wires. Steps involved in the preparation were shodhan, maran and post maran treatment. Raw materials, intermediates and finished product were analyzed as per Ayurvedic pharmacopeia. Modern scientific techniques such as XRD, XPS and SEM were employed to assess the changes taking place during the steps of preparation and thus characterization of the intermediates and finished drug was accomplished. Chronological study of TB preparation, showed that conversion of copper metal to its compounds starts right from shodhan process. Further changes occurring during maran and post maran treatment, gave fair idea about the complex mechanism of TB formation. Sixteen cycles of incineration (puta) were required to get the final product which fulfilled the Ayurveda tests. At the end of puta 16, XRD indicates Cu2O and CuO as major phases in TB, which subsequently transforms into CuO after puta 22. This research also highlights the contribution of post maran process on the Bhasma Article Information 46 and S.
