One of the most rewarding parts of my job, definitely. [Ear infections](http://www.drmeganjanuary.com/earache-treatment-without-antibiotics) and colic are two of the main reasons parents start seeking out a [Pediatric Chiropractor](http://www.drmeganjanuary.com/pediatrics). With colicky babies, a lot times it's one of those things where your baby won't stop crying. The parents and doctors have tried all these different things because nobody really knows what's going on with them. We see two things with colicky babies. Usually it's something in their neck in the upper cervicals, or they're having that digestive problem which they kind of throw into that colic category too. That's more in the middle of the baby's back because that's the nerve supply to their digestive system. Getting both of those things taken care of, we see amazing results in colic, fairly quickly too. During birth your baby's spine gets torqued many different directions. If you were balled up for eight months in your mom's stomach, you might have some neck problems too. Coming out of the vaginal canal during birth or the pulling during birth can cause some trauma. Making sure their little vertebrae is lined up is incredibly low force. It's not like an adult's adjustment. I think people get a little hesitant and scared getting a baby adjusted, especially with the newborns. I usually tell people, \"If you're putting pressure on a tomato and you're breaking the skin, it's probably harder than what I'm pushing on the newborns to get them adjusted.\" Making sure that all of those nerves are getting to where they need to be and lining all those little vertebrae up to let their digestive system work properly is all it takes to give both baby and parents relief.
