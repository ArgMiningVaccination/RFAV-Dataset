Not only is she kind and compassionate, but she is also dedicated to best practice methods as well as remaining informed of the newest research to ensure her patients receive the best possible treatment outcomes. I grew up in as the child of an MD taught to disregard naturopathic healing methods. Dr. Smith literally saved my life after allopathic medicine failed me. I was denied treatment in my home state due to uninformed MDs stuck in an antiquated belief system about biotoxin exposure and the extreme risks this exposure poses to individuals. I highly recommend Dr. Smith and SilverTree Wellness Center. "}
