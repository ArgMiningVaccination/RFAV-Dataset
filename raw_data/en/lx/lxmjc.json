Whitens, Brightens And Evens Skin Tone Crystal Tomato has been scientifically proven to offer the following benefits: - Serves as a natural sunscreen against UVA and UVB rays to protect against UV damage, photo-oxidation and sunburn. - Anti-oxidant effect to protect against free radical damage caused by environmental aggressors (smoke, haze, pollution). - Contains anti-inflammatory properties against wounds and UV damage. - Inhibits melanin synthesis to prevent pigmentation spots from forming. - Reduces the melanin present in the cells including dark acne scars, freckles, dark underarms and age spots for an anti-ageing and anti-photo ageing effect. - Prevents DNA damage. - Promotes even skin tone and radiant complexion. - Protects and enhances the efficacy of other active ingredients and their activity. Unique Active Ingredient The secret to the efficacy of Crystal Tomato lies in the patented active ingredient - Crystal Tomato carotenoids - one of nature's most effective whitening ingredients. The supplement is the result of a decade of research and development by an established international laboratory and is formulated with extracts of a unique breed of non-genetically modified white tomatoes that contain the highest concentration of Crystal Tomato carotenoids. Naturally Safe As this is a natural extract, there are no side effects to consuming this supplement. Unlike orange or red carotenoids, which change the skin's colour to a tan or orange shade when consumed in large amounts, Crystal Tomato carotenoids, do not contain any visible colour and will not affect skin colour. Crystal Tomato is as safe to consume as a tomato but offers so many more benefits for healthier and more radiant skin. Just one-a-day is all it takes. Additional Boost For added benefit, L-Cysteine, an amino acid, is also included in the formulation. L-Cysteine helps to boost the liver's production of Glutathione, commonly referred to as the body's master anti-oxidant, to maintain skin health. Without Glutathione, cells age much more quickly. Glutathione also has the ability to lighten dark skin and pigmentation. Although Glutathione is frequently touted in many oral supplements, it is not well-absorbed when taken orally and therefore has no effect on the skin. By including L-Cysteine, a natural precursor of Glutathione in Crystal Tomato, the natural mechanisms in the body are activated to produce its own Glutathione to improve the appearance of the skin. Beauty From Within Crystal Tomato provides skin whitening, skin health and beauty from within for the whole body, from head to toe - unlike topical applications. Crystal Tomato is the safe, effective solution to youthful, fairer and healthier skin. [border margin=\"no\"][/border] Frequently Asked Questions About Crystal Tomato Is Crystal Tomato safe? Yes, it is a tomato-based supplement and has been in the market since 2012. Widely popular, there have been no adverse reports to date. Can you briefly explain what are carotenoids and how do they benefit the skin? Carotenoids are a class of natural chemicals which primarily functions as an antioxidant. What is the difference between Crystal Tomato and Carotenoids? There are many Carotenoids, the most well known ones being beta carotene (orange in colour and with a high presence in carrots) and Lycopene (bright red colour, high presence in tomatoes). Crystal Tomato carotenoids are the first in the family. They have no colour; they absorb UV. As you may recall, colour reflects the absorption of visible light; colourless substances do not absorb in the visible spectrum, they absorb at lower wavelength (UV) or higher wavelength (Infra Red). Is phytoene & phytofluene found in regular tomatoes? Phytoene is found at a concentration 400 times lower in a regular tomato, while Phytofluene is not found in regular tomatoes. Are they found in this white tomato in higher concentrations compared to regular tomatoes? Yes; but more importantly, normal tomatoes have high concentration of coloured carotenoids which colour the skin (tan-like to orange colour). How many tomatoes worth of Crystal Tomato carotenoids are in each caplet? Because of the high concentration of carotenoids in this particular tomato, each pill corresponds to 3 special tomatoes. Does consuming carotenoids/carotene give the same whitening effect as consuming CLCs? How much would you have to eat to get this whitening effect, and what would be the side effect to the skin (e.g. skin turns orange instead)? Consuming too much carotenoids increases the colour of the skin, making it look orange. As other products or normal tomatoes contain coloured carotenoids they are not adequate for skin whitening and protection against UV. Only Crystal Tomato carotenoids absorb UV and protect the skin while reducing melanin. Are there clinical studies that demonstrate lightening of the skin by using Crystal Tomato orally? There are several clinical studies to show that when taken orally, the Crystal Tomato carotenoids concentrate preferentially in the skin. Other tests were done in-vitro; showing that Crystal Tomato reduced existing melanin, preventing the formation of new melanin while absorbing UV radiation (UVB and UVA). In a clinical studies* carried out at National Skin Centre of Singapore, a combination treatment of Crystal Tomato supplement and Crystal Clear Skin Clarity Cream showed significantly better results than the industry's most well known whitening agents. *Results and conclusions of the trial was accepted and published in the leading American scientific journal, Journal of Pigmentary Disorders, December 2014.
