Caught Between Borders and this conference are an attempt to bet-ter understand the situation facingthe displaced by looking more closelyat what they do for themselves andamong themselves to respond to thetrauma and upheaval of displacement.What we learned was a testimony tothe ingenuity and courage of the dis-placed. Secondly, while improved knowledge and understanding by themselves areimportant, the objective of greaterunderstanding was to enable NRC as ahumanitarian organisation to respondbetter to the needs of the displacedand contribute to the wider objectivesof the humanitarian community. Thechallenge now is to ensure that thisperspective is included in the plan- ning and implementation of allprogramme activities. By bringing together experts from around the world as well as contribu-tors to the book, some of whom aredisplaced in their home country, wecan together seek ways to improveour response to the needs of the dis-placed and identify ways to enable usto better support the activities andstrategies they undertake. We hope that this conference will be a first step in defining practical meth-ods and tools for both practitionersand researchers working with protec-tion and assistance to IDPs on how tobuild on self-help activities andresponse strategies. Specific recom-mendations and workable proposalson how to proceed are needed.Equally important is the need todefine responsibilities for follow-up. The job will not be easy. As we watch events unfold in Afghanistan, thecomplexity of the task is clear. On theone hand, humanitarian organisations need to respond quickly and efficient-ly in an emergency in order to avoidloss of life. At the same time, howev-er, in order to respond appropriately,we need to understand and workwithin a complex and changing socialfabric. How do we balance thesesometimes competing interests andneeds? We hope that today we will make a small step forward in our under-standing. 4 FWelcome address by Steinar S\u00f8rlie, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council On behalf of the Norwegian Refugee Council, it is a pleasure for me to welcome you all to this conference. NRC/Lars Torjesen5 n the one hand, they have often been let down by their ownnational authorities that were supposed to protect them from becom-ing IDPs in the first place. On the otherhand, unlike refugees, they do not havean international organisation to dealwith their plight. The basic principle ofstate sovereignty limits the ability ofthe international community to providethem with assistance and protection. During the past few years, increased international efforts have been made toimprove the lot of the internally dis-placed. Their sheer number has madethem a phenomenon in world politicsthat cannot be ignored. InfluentialNGOs like the Norwegian RefugeeCouncil have also helped to put IDPson the international agenda. Norway for one has been among those states that have worked to involve theUN in this respect and the NorwegianUN Mission is currently hard at workpromoting this year's main GeneralAssembly resolution on IDPs. Ourguiding principle is that the interna-tional community has the right andthe obligation to ensure that thehumanitarian and human rights ofIDPs under international law arerespected. Nevertheless, we maintain that it is the national authorities thathave primary responsibility for provid-ing protection and assistance to IDPswithin their jurisdiction. Since IDPs have become an object of international diplomacy, the focus hasbeen on protection and assistance.Progress in this area, as in so manyother areas of international diplomacy,is slow. But I am pleased to note thatwe are moving steadily forward. Some of the prime movers whose contribu-tions to the IDP cause have been trulysignificant are with us here today. It isa privilege to have here one of the prin-cipal architects behind the milestonedocument The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement , Roberta Cohen, as well as the UN Special Coordinatorfor Internal Displacement, KofiAsomani. The Norwegian Refugee Council has played a leading role in focusing worldattention on the internally displaced,especially through its global IDP data-base, and I am happy to see that onceagain the Council is pioneering a newunderstanding of IDPs. Whereas the ini-tial centre of attention has been on theinternally displaced as victims in needof protection and assistance, the nextstep is to recognise the immensehuman resources that IDPs represent.They need to be given a voice. This willimprove our understanding of their sit-uation and enable us to better targetour efforts on their behalf. The book that is being launched today, Caught Between Borders: ResponseStrategies of the Internally Displaced,does give the IDPs a voice - indeed, several voices. And we owe it tothem to listen. It is a groundbreakingcontribution to enhancing our com- prehension of how individuals, familiesand communities respond to the expe-rience of displacement. I am sure thatthe book will offer insights that willbenefit IDPs and their cause. Today's seminar will also give the internally displaced a face. ThorvaldStoltenberg, the former NorwegianForeign Minister and UN High Commissioner for Refugees, entitledhis recently published memoirs It's a question of human beings. We must get past IDPs as an abstract notion andappreciate that they are individuals,like you and me. Although they sharecertain aspects of the experience ofdisplacement, the circumstances oftheir displacement and their reactionsto it may be quite different. Each inter-nally displaced person respondsaccording to his or her character andbackground. This notwithstanding, I still believe that IDPs have common elements andinterests that make it worthwhile pur-suing an international policy towardsthem as a broad category. Our chal-lenge continues to be to fill in the largeand small cracks that still trap millionsand millions of our fellow humanbeings. My hope is that today's eventwill help meet this challenge. I wishyou every success. Introductory address by Kim Traavik, State Secretary (Conservative Party), Ministry of Foreign Affairs In Norwegian we have an expression: 'to fall between two chairs'. I think the English equivalent is to 'fall between the cracks'. In many ways, thisdescribes the situation of IDPs. O6 he relevance of this topic is beyond dispute. I would espe-cially like to thank and congratulate NRC for its support tothe project that preceded this seminarand which has resulted in the bookCaught Between Borders that I edited with Marc Vincent. What I find mostcommendable here are not simply thetime and money invested by NRC butrather the approach and attitude thathave been expressed. Practitioners and researchers tend to work in separate worlds. Practitionersdefend this position by arguing thatresearch is too time-consuming orirrelevant to practice and policy.Researchers, on the other hand, claimthat practitioners are governed bytheir own organisations' agendas,always impose their own worldviewand categories and resist the complex-ities of life. However, there are alsosome with a keen interest in findingways in which the existing gapbetween research, practical work andpolicy making can be bridged. NRC, I believe, belongs to this last cate-gory. This project is an example ofhow the agendas and interests ofpractitioners and policy makers onthe one hand and those ofresearchers on the other can becombined in a joint effort toenhance the understanding andhopefully improve the responses toa particular situation. This leads me to my own role in the project - and my own agenda.When I participated in a similarseminar organised by NRC in 1997in order to get IDPs on the interna-tional agenda, I was surprised anddisturbed to hear most participantsspeaking only about how 'we' couldhelp 'them'. It became clear that IDPs were in the process of becominga new category of humanitarian con-cern, defined primarily by its lack -lack of home, lack of rights, lack ofresources and lack of a proper legaldefinition. Let me immediately stress that I do not dispute that those forcefully dis-placed as a result of war are often inneed of various forms of assistance.Rather, my objection concerns, firstly,the grouping together of some 20-25million people from several continentsinto one single humanitarian categorywith little attention to the aspects thatdefine the internal differences of that category. Secondly, it concerns the speedy conclusion that these people'have lost everything', a judgementwhich is the basis of many well-intended humanitarian interventionsbut which also strips people of theirhistory and identity and disregardstheir capacity to act in response to thecrises in their lives. In other words,internal refugees become defined asvictims and beneficiaries, not aspeople and actors. More attention must be paid to how IDPs, like other people affected by war, seek to re-con-struct their own livelihoods - socially,psychologically, economically, political-ly and culturally. I believe that what I, and others of similar orientation, said at that con-ference was an important input intocreating the Response StrategiesProject. When I was later invited tocoordinate with Marc Vincent the pre-sent project on how IDPs respond tocrisis and displacement we agreedthat our starting point would be tosee IDPs as actors - even when theywere clearly victims. We also agreedthat, insofar as possible, our investi-gation of the issue should be based onfield research, interviews and partici-patory methods that would betterallow us to see things from IDPs' ownpoint of view. All are aspects that arecharacteristic of an anthropologicalapproach. Finally we agreed to adopt Francis Deng's Guiding Principles as a themat-ic guideline for all the country casestudies. Regardless of the initial moti-vation for choosing these as aframework, they also turned out to beuseful in linking the humanitarian andthe research agendas and creating ashared framework, focus and language. Employing an anthropological approach has allowed broader, morepersonal and, perhaps, more in-depthaccounts to be voiced. Practitionerswith responsibility for a programmeor project, of course, also interviewpeople at various stages in the projectcycle. My own experiences tell me thatoften you end up steering the inter-view and only listen partially. Basicallywhat you are interested in hearing iswhat needs people have that somehowmatch your mandate and capacity asan organisation. That this is the caseis, for instance, reflected in the differ-ent 'shopping lists' that people inareas with many humanitarian agen-cies - they know exactly whatto tell SCF, Oxfam, UNICEF and others.The diversity of lived experiences istranslated into a limited and tangible TIDPs: an anthropological perspective by Birgitte Refslund S\u00f8rensen I would like to thank the Norwegian Refugee Council, NTNU and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs(MFA) for inviting us all to this seminar on theresponse strategies of people who are displaced byconflict within the borders of their country. number of 'needs' that are defined by 'availability and supply'. I do not claim that we arrived at whole truth and nothing but the truthbut I do think that because we did notcome to the task with any precon-ceived ideas we got a broader andmore complex picture. If people'sresponses can be used to make ajudgment, it was significant andheartening that so many peopleexpressed their appreciation that\"finally somebody has listened to our story\". There were other benefits too. The field studies brought out the internaldifferentiation of the IDP category.Despite often stressing how importantit is to remember this we frequentlyfall back on the general IDP category.'IDP' has different histories and socialand political meanings in differentconflicts. Rather than being an objec-tive universal descriptive category, itis one that is constantly being sociallyand politically constructed. The pro-ject also reminded us that differencesin religion, ethnicity, gender, age andoccupation influence not only how and to what extent people are affect-ed by forced displacement but alsothe response strategies that peopledevelop. In several case studies itbecame apparent that forced displace-ment is never the only axis of identityand that in most cases it is far frombeing the most important one.Religion, ethnicity, gender, age, occu-pation or other aspects of identify aremore important than being an IDP. This leads to the second point regard- ing the interpretation or narrative ofdisplacement. Humanitarian thinkingidentifies conflict and displacementas the main cause of displaced peo-ple's current predicaments and oftenfalsely assumes that displacement isthen also the most important event inpeople's lives. There is a furtherassumption that displacement is atemporary deviation from normal life,that it exists only between brackets,so to speak, and that consequently alldisplaced people long for return andresettlement. Studies showed, how-ever, that other events, positionsand relationships were often evokedin explanation of a person's current situation. Getting married or marry-ing off your daughter were, forinstance, often seen as more signifi-cant events, which changed aperson's social identity and status ina more fundamental way. Another point that was brought out clearly was that in several cases dis-placement was interpreted within aspecific cultural framework that gaveit a particular meaning and some-times even purpose as part of agroup's or community's self-realisa-tion. The study showed that thenotion of 'home', which is so centralin the discussion of displacement andresettlement, was much more ambigu-ous than we tend to think. The ideathat 'home' is your community, yourvillage, the place where you, yourancestors and relatives come from,the soil where your identity is rootedand where you have an almost naturalsense of belonging, is only partly true.IDPs' accounts revealed that this wasonly the case for some. For others,'home' was something that wasalways in a process of being created, 7 IDPs: an anthropological perspective UNHCR/M KobayashiIDPs returning to East Timor.IDPs: an anthropological perspective 8 depending as much on future oppor- tunities as on past experiences. This shows us that while we tend to think of displacement as a temporarydeviation from normal life, a disrup-tive event to be corrected, thepossibility also exists that some peo-ple see displacement as anopportunity for change. People do notonly look back; they also look to thefuture and try to plan for it. The third point I would like to include concerns the social meanings of socialand economic activities. Often whendiscussing the initiatives of people, orthe projects of agencies, we focus onthe activity itself in a narrow sense.For instance, when talking about eco-nomic activities we simply talk abouttrade or business, maybe including adescription of the items being traded.Our interviews showed that an activitysuch as 'making baskets and sellingthem at the local market' could meanvery different things to different peo-ple. It could be a continuation of arecognised pre-war activity, providinga guaranteed level of income while also defining the person's social iden-tity as member of a community. Itcould be a new activity that impliedlearning new skills, entering new rela-tionships, reworking domestic genderroles and perhaps even risking socialstigmatisation and marginalisation. Inthat case economic gains would havetremendous social costs. The generalpoint here to remember is that IDPs -like any other social group - inhabitparticular social and cultural worlds. We must not lose sight of the capacity of people to analyse their own situa-tion. When we gave IDPs the chance totalk about what they had done priorto, during and after displacement,rather than what their needs were (thestandard project needs assessmentsapproach), many of them demonstrat-ed great capacity to analyse theirsituation and make risk assessments.Their analyses were translated intoactions that prepared them for whatmight come but also informed theirconstant adjustments of responsestrategies and learning from pastexperiences. In fact, their analyses were often more in touch with recentdevelopments and more precise (con-taining more variables and concretedetails) than those provided by theexternal agencies. In conclusion, I believe that the approach taken by this initiative,which has focused on documenting'conflict and displacement as the IDPsexperience it and respond to it', hascontributed many novel insights andperspectives. Many issues remainunexplored and not yet well under-stood. I hope that you, practitionersand researchers, will take this oppor-tunity to identify and discuss possibleshared interests, so that in the com-ing years we will see a number of newinitiatives in this direction.

Email: birgitte.soerensen@anthro.ku.dk e felt that, while there was alot of emphasis on institu-tional dilemmas and issues of sovereignty, we needed to lookmore closely at how real peoplerespond to displacement. This wasparticularly important if we were tobegin working on our second objec-tive which was to try to see how wecan develop concrete recommenda-tions as a humanitarian community toimprove our response. These objectives are not particularly new. Indeed, the refugee field and theanthropology field have been talkingabout them for a long time. So whatexactly have we tried to do that was different? Firstly, although many of the condi- tions facing IDPs may be the same asthose facing refugees, we know thattheir context can be very different asa result of their closer proximity tothe actual armed actors or potentialsecurity and protection threats. Inorder to better understand the protec-tion issues we wanted to focus someof our attention on that particulararea. Secondly, as many of us who are working in the humanitarian fieldknow, we frequently talk about theneed to better integrate and includethe displaced in our decision-makingprocesses. This is something which isclearly supported in the GuidingPrinciples on Internal Displacement.Often, however, the difficulty is find-ing out how best to integrate andResponse strategies: the need to involve the displaced by Marc Vincent I would like to start with an overview of the Response Strategies Project. We started with twoprincipal objectives, the first of which was to under-stand how individuals in communities respond todisplacement. W9 include them. It always seems that when emergencies begin and when weare doing evaluations, it is not untilthe end of the process or after the so-called 'emergency phase' that wedecide to consult the displaced. Weneed to involve the displaced earlierin the process - indeed, from the verybeginning. For that reason we wantedto start from the very beginning, bylooking at what the displaced do forthemselves and among themselves. What did we learn from this process? The first lesson for me was to recon-sider the lens through which weviewed the problems of internal dis-placement. As humanitarian workerswe tend to see things in logisticalterms, in terms of emergencies anddelivering assistance as fast as wecan, or we think in terms of protec-tion. And so we often see thedisplaced through a one-dimensionallens: we see them as victims ratherthan as human beings with varioushistories and backgrounds, ambitionsand resources. As Birgitte RefslundS\u00f8rensen has said, there are differentaxes of identity and all these differentaxes have an impact on how peoplerespond to displacement. Narrow perspective on vulnerability By using the uni-dimensional lens we create our own dilemmas and expec-tations as well as false dichotomies. Iam reminded of a workshop that werecently held in Burundi where therewas much discussion about vulnera-bility. The question was askedwhether IDPs are more vulnerablethan people living in their own com-munity and whether refugees aremore vulnerable than IDPs. First, thequestion assumed that IDPs must bevulnerable and, second, the ensuingdiscussion created a pointless cate-gorisation of who is more vulnerable.Some of the chapters in the bookCaught Between Borders actually tell a more nuanced story. The research showed that sometimes a person may be displaced yet notnecessarily be vulnerable. In fact, itshowed that some people even man-aged to improve aspects of their lifeduring displacement - such as findingaccess to education which they werenot able to do before. In anotherexample the research in Angola andAfghanistan showed that people whoare not displaced may be more vul- nerable than those who weredisplaced, because some were unableto flee because of financial reasons. The point I am trying to make is that, generally, it is important that weagree that the internally displaced arefrequently more vulnerable than othervictims of conflict precisely becausethey have been forced from theirhomes and communities. However, inorder to really understand their situa-tion and what we need to do torespond, we need to look at them asindividuals at the family and commu-nity level. That is why we have chosento use the term 'changing the humani-tarian lens' for this conference. It isnot easy for us to step outside thathumanitarian role but I think it issomething that we have to do if weare to better understand what IDPsthemselves are doing and how weshould respond. It is only when we do change the lens that we get to see both variety andingenuity among the displaced. Andwe also get a better view of what weshould be doing as a humanitariancommunity to respond to displace-ment without upsetting the delicateUNHCR/M Kobayashi IDP children in Sri Lanka10 Response strategies: the need to involve the displaced social balance and fabric - or making things worse than they already are. Preparation for displacement One area that I found particularly fas-cinating during the research was thelevel of preparation for displacementamong IDPs. For me, it turned theidea of the displaced as victims on itshead and came as a surprise.Comments from Burundi, for example,illustrated that those who survivedthe first instance of flight had muchbetter chances of surviving subse-quent displacements because theybecame better informed, they werebetter able to identify the risks andthey had been able to identify somecontingency plans. There was a clearlearning curve. It showed up in theidentification of essential supplies. InBurma, for example, those displacedwere able to pre-position suppliesalong potential escape routes prior tothe arrival of military patrols. In othercountries there was a change in atti-tude towards goods and belongings;mobile assets - something that youcould carry with you - and personalskills became increasingly important. In another example from Angola, the chapter describes a tailor who hadbeen displaced several times. Healways brought his sewing machinewith him because it gave him someform of survival capacity after dis-placement; this was something he hadlearned after the first experience of losing everything. Another example of the learning processes of the displaced was thedevelopment of escape routes andsafe havens. One revelation was thenumber of information networks andearly warning systems that existedamong displaced communities. Thesecould be based on groups and fami-lies, on kinship or community. Whendisplacement occurred regularly theseinformation networks were extremelywell developed. In Columbia, forexample, the potentially displacedrelied on both traditional warning sys-tems - such as cattle horns - or moresophisticated messages hidden withinradio programmes to warn of thepresence of armed actors and enablethose potentially in danger to move tosafe areas. However, although thisreveals the resources and capacityavailable, we must be cautious andnot assume that these mechanismsalways work. Despite all the mecha-nisms that exist in Colombia, manypeople still preferred to escape theirhome areas altogether and move inanonymity to large urban settings. Learning to listen What kind of implications does thisresearch have for the humanitarianresponse? The first implication isclearly the need to listen better.Obviously, the displaced are muchbetter prepared than the humanitarian community gives them credit for.Humanitarian organisations often pre-fer to rely on their own analysis of asituation rather than giving credenceto local analysis. And this can oftenhave disastrous consequences.Humanitarian organisations need tomake more of an effort to listen toand learn from local analysis. Theycan then support local actors in devel-oping feasible contingency plansshould they be displaced again. Another area of great importance which came out in the research wasthe area of shifting gender and gener-ational roles. The case-studies clearlyunderscored the importance of sup-porting changes in family life and inthe extended community. These arethe structures that play such animportant part in sustaining responsebut they are also the structures thatundergo a great deal of strain. Forexample, many of the contributors tothe book noted that men seemed tosuffer more from losing their housesand employment because that losshad a direct consequence on theirsense of identity and dignity. Thesestrains were reflected in destructivebehaviour ranging from increased alco-holism to violence and direct challengesto women's role as bread-winners. For women, displacement prompted a wide range of emotions from despairabout providing for their family toenthusiasm about their newly-wonfreedom and their new roles withinthe family. The humanitarian commu-nity frequently looks at womenseparately or at women and childrenas vulnerable groups but perhaps weshould be looking more closely at therelationship between women and menand children so that we can minimisethose strains. Another area of importance that came out of the research was the questionof documentation. We often underesti-mate the value of documentation butit is incredibly important for freedomof movement and for accessing socialservices. It would be worthwhile look-ing at how the humanitariancommunity could more regularly facilitate access to documentation. Marc Vincent was until December2001 the coordinator of theGlobal IDP Project (www.idpproject.org). He now for vincent.m@un.org. IDPs in Pavarando Camp, Colombia UNHCR/J Spaullspeak also as a leader of an NGO which I set up with severalfriends to organise psycho-reha- bilitation programmes for ourtraumatised children and vocationaltraining programmes for the disabledwomen in our community; and, final-ly, as a member of the UN team inGeorgia who has been given theopportunity to promote the needs ofthe IDP community at the UN level.From all these points of view I want togive you one message: we do not wantto be IDPs. We do not want our chil-dren to be labelled as IDPs; we wantto return home and - until this is pos-sible - we want to live as equalcitizens, with dignity and equal rights. Prospects of return After the breakup of the Soviet Union,military conflicts in Georgia led tomassive displacement of the mainlyGeorgian population from the zonesof conflict (Abkhazia and theTskhinvali regions). Abkhazia thenannounced its independence and de facto separation from Georgia. The return of IDPs is now dependent onrestoring Georgian jurisdiction overthe territory of Abkhazia (or on thecreation of international mechanismsfor guaranteeing security).According to official data, there are about 282,000 IDPs in government-controlled Georgia. Approximately40% live in so-called communal cen-tres - former public buildings, such ashostels, hotels, hospitals, kinder-gartens and shops. The rest live'temporarily' with relatives or friends;some eventually manage to buy pri-vate accommodation. Eight years havepassed and those IDPs who have man-aged to adapt and find jobs representthe minority. The majority of IDPsstill need to think about survival. Thecommunal centres are overcrowded,most IDPs live in miserable condi-tions, unemployment is very high andthe prospect of political settlement ofthe conflict is uncertain. Security of returnees: peace initiatives and prospects There have been official peace talks since 1994 but no real achievements.The concept of the status of Abkhaziain the framework of a united Georgia,which was prepared by the SpecialRepresentative of the UN SecretaryGeneral for Georgia, was recently onceagain rejected by the UN SecurityCouncil due to the position taken bythe Russian delegation. Success is more evident at the level of civil society, where Georgian andAbkhaz NGOs have established coop-eration and even managed jointimplementation of some projects.Unfortunately, this cooperation stopsimmediately whenever the question ofIDP returns is raised. The only zone of possible return for IDPs is the border region, the Gali dis-trict, which before the war (and evennow) was populated almost exclusive-ly by Georgians. From time to timethey return to work their lands butnobody takes responsibility for theirsecurity. The Georgian government has no access because this zone iscontrolled by Abkhaz and Russiansecurity forces. As a result, Georgianreturnees are subject to all kinds ofviolations of human rights - in partic-ular personal security and right toemployment. Women are major vic-tims of these violations because theyrepresent the majority of returnees.Schools which were reopened in theGali district were ordered by the de facto Abkhaz government to operate in the Russian language which, inpractice, is not yet possible as theteachers cannot teach in Russian. Inthe long term it is feared the Georgianlanguage will be eliminated from theregion. Economic and social status of IDPs in Georgia:prospects for survival The social and economic situation of the IDP community is a subject ofconcern. Humanitarian needs are stillgreat, especially in remote areaswhere hunger is rife. IDPs with noaccess to land and who live in com-munal centres cannot ensure even aminimal standard of living: the stateallowance is wholly inadequate (US$7per month) and paid very irregularly.The overall deterioration in the situa-tion in Georgia has brought evengreater frustration for the IDP popula-tion. In the face of electricity andwater shortages, the advent of winter,increasing political instability andgovernmental crisis, the prospects forimprovement and positive action forIDPs look doubtful indeed. For a number of years, the Georgian government recognised only oneoption for the IDP population: returnto Abkhazia. At the same time,because of the lack of progress inofficial negotiations, it was clear thatthe displaced should have the oppor-tunity at least to gain temporaryintegration. UNDP, UNHCR, the WorldBank and NGOs involved in IDP issuestried for a long time to promote theright of IDPs to participate on an11 Internal displacement in Georgia: a personal perspective by Julia Kharashvili I speak as an IDP woman whose husband was miss- ing after the war in Georgia, and who was displacedwith two small children, no shelter and no job. I12 Internal displacement in Georgia: a personal perspective equal basis in development pro- grammes; finally in 1999 the Georgiangovernment and the UN togetherlaunched a \"new approach to IDPassistance\". The Georgian Self-Reliance Fund (GSRF) was created: apilot fund for the support of self-reliance initiatives which should beinnovative and appropriate for the IDPcommunity. The \"new approach\" wasan attempt to include the internallydisplaced in a general framework ofdevelopment and to ensure theirequal rights to employment, housingand social services. Initial contributions for the fund were provided by the UN agencies, USAIDand the Swiss Agency for Development.Unfortunately, the GSRF has not yetbecome an instrument for realchange, firstly because it is only apilot fund and secondly because theprocess was developed too slowly. Atthe same time, expectations in the IDPcommunity were and continue to bevery high. It is important to mentionthat there is still a great interest inthis fund among the IDP population.No fewer than 85 projects were sub-mitted to the current, second roundof competition. There are several opportunities for improvement of this \"new approach\"initiative and for transforming it intoa real tool for social change in the IDPcommunity:The new approach should beimplemented in its entirety, notfocusing only on GSRF; the firstarticle of this initiative, for exam-ple, stated that the UN shouldcontinue to promote the right ofIDPs to return to Abkhazia. Equal rights and access to infor-mation should not only befinanced through GSRF but alsoadvocated at all levels; here theUN can cooperate more explicitlywith the NGOs. More international and nationalNGOs should participate in thedesign and monitoring of this ini-tiative. It is important that the initiativescoming from the UN or otherintergovernmental organisationsare gender-sensitive and recog-nise the role that IDP womenhave - and continue toplay - in their community's sur-vival during the emergency andpost-emergency stages. It is vital to ensure that theguidelines of the new approachreflect the vision of the IDPsthemselves, not the donor com-munity's vision. Most importantly, the newapproach initiative should havesufficient financial backing toensure that all real initiatives can be financed and implemented. The UN and other initiators ofthe new approach should ensurethat useful and innovative pro-jects approved by the GSRF canbe replicated in different regionsfor both the IDP and the residentcommunities (such as road infra-structure and rehabilitation ofpublic buildings). Recent paramilitary operations in Abkhazia have shown that ex-combat-ants, veterans and war invalids can beeasily recruited into the armed forcessimply because they have no positivealternative. In Georgia, the interna-tional community has always beenreluctant to work with this categoryof IDPs. No nationwide demobilisationprogrammes, retraining or specialeducation have been undertaken.Their skills are a resource whichshould be harnessed to stabilise thesituation and to give these IDPs achance to participate in preparationsfor peaceful return or integration. The word 'integration' continues to be painful for IDPs. Even when they havethe chance to integrate with the resi-dent community, it is difficultpsychologically as they would still pre-fer to return if Georgian jurisdictionover Abkhazia were restored. Providinga meaningful legal guarantee thatimprovement of IDP living conditions Corn-growing pro- ject for 100 Abkhaz IDP families whose prospects of return are limited. UNHCR/A Hollmannin government-controlled Georgia would not imperil the chance ofreturning to Abkhazia would makedevelopment programmes much moreattractive for the displaced population. The IDP community in Georgia repre- sents very different groups, rangingfrom peasants from the Gali to a high-ly educated community (about 45%with a university degree) fromSukhumi. Many have experience intechnology, agricultural managementand industry. With their knowledge ofresources, skills and implementation,they have created their own develop-ment strategies which could easily beincluded in the international commu-nity's development programmes. Atthe same time, humanitarian assis-tance has almost ground to a halt andthe most vulnerable IDPs have fewsurvival resources. Who can and should give a voice to IDPs today? The government in exile, recreated in exile after displacement, initiallyserved as a means of communicationwith the central government but hasnow almost lost this function.Economically, the government hasshowed no ability to mobilise resourcesfor development of the IDP community.They are not sufficiently trusted by theinternational organisations and donorcommunity and cannot set up real sup-porting structures. From the beginning, international and local NGOs in Georgia have beenworking shoulder to shoulder to pro-tect the rights of the displaced, toraise the capacity of IDPs and toaddress their most urgent needs. Theworking groups from the GenevaConference on Migration has created anetwork to promote equal politicaland social participation of IDPs. Atthe same time, over the last few yearsthe IDP community itself has not beenvery active at the level of civil societyand has tried mainly to achieve itsgoals through political demands andactions. Several NGOs existing thendid not significantly change the gener-al picture. During the last year, however, some changes in the social structure of theIDP community have been evident.When the process of establishing non-governmental and community-basedorganisations was reinforced both bydonor policy (such as the newapproach initiative) and by the failureof official negotiations for peaceful return, at least four different net-works of IDP NGOs were created inthe capital and in the regions.Recently, a forum of NGOs of IDPsand refugees from the SouthernCaucasus was held in Tbilisi to dis-cuss the opportunities and challengesfacing them. Many constructive pro-posals were put forward. The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement present a range of waysto increase social participation of IDPsand to improve their standard of liv-ing and status in the community. Insome regions, such as Samegreloregion which has a very large IDP pop-ulation, both local authorities andIDPs themselves have a poor under-standing of the Guiding Principles. Inother areas, however, organisationsare starting to use them as a tool ineveryday practice. In 2001 a new elec-toral law was approved which,because of NGO lobbying, allows IDPsthe right to fully participate in parlia-mentary and municipal elections. It isnecessary to raise awareness of theGuiding Principles not only ingovern ment-controlled Georgia but also in the zone of possible return sothat the de facto authorities also know the legal rights of returnees. Conclusions There are many untappedresources within the humanitari-an and intergovernmentalorganisations, as well as withinthe IDP community itself. After eight years of displacement,civic activists from the IDP com-munity are ready to take onresponsibility. The creation ofNGOs and community basedorganisations is enabling them to identify and make more effectiveuse of the intellectual and socialcapital of the IDP community. Programme design shouldacknowledge the capacity andvision of the IDP community. The state, together with interna-tional organisations, shoulddesign programmes which willemploy both IDPs and residentsliving in the same areas, in thesame type of work, for the bene-fit of the whole of society. Vulnerable groups should beassisted within the framework ofdevelopment programmes, draw-ing on Georgia's experience from1998 when emergency assistancewas provided within the frame-work of development. Project blueprints should bedeveloped - to be implementedby the Georgian government withsupport from the UN, internation-al organisations and NGOs -which realistically meet theobjectives of the new approach:better housing, better employ-ment, equal human rights andequal benefits for IDPs and resi-dent communities. The Guiding Principles onInternal Displacement should bepromoted to the de facto authori- ties in conflict zones which arepossible areas of return.

I was also studying for a degreein Spanish and Literature. I was com-munity leader for the district where Ilived, developing social programmesto help improve the quality of life ofthe residents. In 1998, the army's 11th Brigade initi- ated a major project to build twooxidation lakes for the treatment ofsewage effluent from military installa-tions on the perimeter of the district.Aware of the potentially harmfuleffects for the environment and thehealth of the inhabitants, the commu-nity opposed their construction. Theywrote letters, held protests and con-vened a Public Environmental Hearing. As president of the Committee for Communal Action and as one of theleaders opposing the project, Ireceived verbal threats from membersof the B-2 military intelligence organi-sation. Armed B-2 agents visited myhome. Eventually in May 1998 I had toleave with my family. After our arrival in Bogota, our living conditions were very poor. I receivedno assistance from the governmentand had to look elsewhere to survive,seeking help from the churches, NGOsand local communities to support myfamily - my wife and two sons of oneand eight years. We initially rented an apartment. We did not try to access governmentassistance as, in addition to the lackof information about how to apply, wealso feared for our safety in case theauthorities denounced us to the army. This situation lasted for five monthsuntil we received emergency humani-tarian assistance from the Ministry ofthe Interior. In 1999 we set up the Association of Displaced People for PeacefulCoexistence (ADESCOP) in order tooffer solidarity to displaced familiesand to develop assistance pro-grammes in accordance withColombia's 1997 Law 387. This organ-isation, of which I am president,currently includes 250 families.ADESCOP is part of the Bogota Deskon Internal Displacement, formed by three organisations of displaced peo-ple working with an NGO devoted toformulating proposals for solutionsand to developing dialogue withnational and local government author-ities. Since 2000 ADESCOP has beeninvolved in the National Coordinationof Displaced Persons, an attempt atawareness-raising by IDP organisa-tions in different regions of thecountry. Despite many difficulties, wehave tried to establish a dialogue withthe National System for Care of theDisplaced Population. In February 2001 I was elected Representative of the Displaced in theDistrict Council for Care of theDisplaced Population, responsible forthe development of the District Planfor Care of the Displaced Populationand for ensuring its coordinatedimplementation by the DistrictMayor's office and by the public enti- My experience as a leader of the displaced in Colombia by Antonio Perez Ballestero Hober In the 1980s the department of Cordoba started to be affected by the presence of paramilitary groupsand by their actions against the civil population,especially against peasant, community and unionleaders. A CINEP (Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n y Educaci\u00f3n Popular)ties at national level. Despite the fact that the representatives of the dis-placed in this council have beenconstant in participation and in puttingforward proposals for action, aftereight months of meetings the DistrictPlan has still not been approved. In my experience, the main difficulties for the organisations of the displacedand for its leaders are: the dispersal, heterogeneity andanonymity of the displaced popu-lations in Bogota lack of information among thedisplaced population regardingtheir rights and regarding theprocesses for access to the fewgovernment programmes thatexist the continuation of persecution,threats and attacks by armedgroups discrimination and rejection bylocal authorities and communities Despite the existence of a lawprotecting the rights of the dis-placed, the response of the stateis less than generous, usually lateand generally focused on emer-gency assistance. Furthermore,the authorities delegate theirresponsiblities to national and international NGOs. Facing this situation, the dis-placed population is then at thewhim of offers of help and ofpressure by political sectors andarmed groups. Basic operating conditions do notexist for organisations nor forthe practice of leadership anddialogue with the state. The gov-ernment does not support theorganisations; its relations withthem are characterised by dis-trust, lack of transparency andverbal aggression. Also, in thefew instances of participationand dialogue, the governmentwill not offer logistical assistance(offices, transport, photocopiesof documents, etc) which meansthat most of the organisationsare weak and it is difficult for theleaders to do their work and sup-port their families. The government does not meetits obligations under Law 387 tooffer protection to IDPs andtheir leaders, many of whom areonce again victims of threats,attacks and repeated displacement.On the other hand, my experience does offer some positive results: Despite all the above constraints,the displaced population persistsin its attempts to organise inorder to rebuild its social fabricand to demand that the govern-ment fulfil its legal duties to carefor and protect IDPs. Through its efforts in organisa-tion and training, the displacedpopulation has succeeded in for-mulating and disseminatingseveral proposals for widescalesolutions (such as resettlementand urban integration) andpressed demands for truth, jus-tice and reparation. There has been some progress inrelations between the organisa-tions for the displacedpopulation and national andinternational NGOs, UN agenciesand other sectors of Colombiancivil society.

The Unit will bring togeth-er major agencies working for IDPs. In July 2000 the UN Inter-AgencyStanding Committee, a body thatgroups agencies involved in humani-tarian work, decided to establish anInter-Agency network on internal dis-placement composed of focal pointsfrom different organisations. The net-work was to be an ad hoc body which would look at the questions of inter-nal displacement and come up withrecommendations. A special co-ordi-nator was appointed, my predecessor Dennis McNamara. This group hasundertaken a number of missions todifferent IDP situations, visitingEthiopia, Eritrea, Burundi,Afghanistan, Colombia and Angola.The network came up with recommen-dations on ways of improving theresponse to IDP situations in thesecountries. In addition to the missions, one of the tasks of the network was to proposeinstitutional mechanisms for respond-ing to these situations of internaldisplacement. In August 2001 it wasdecided to create a Unit. Putting thisUnit together is one of the tasks that Ihave undertaken. The Unit is expectedto strengthen the hand of theEmergency Relief Coordinator whoheads the UN Office for theIDPs: time to move forward by Kofi Asomani Governments and the UN believe that the response to internal displacement has often been ineffective. I IDPs: time to move forward 16 Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and to find ways of support-ing the system when there is anemergency concerning IDPs. The Unitwill be small, non-operational key IDP agencies as UNICEF,WFP, UNDP and IOM, as well as NGOs.The recommendation to set up theUnit has been endorsed by the UNSecretary-General and we expect theUnit to be fully operational from 1January 2002. In addition to the involvement of UN organisations, the Unit will workclosely with other intergovernmentalorganisations and the large range ofNGOs working with IDPs. We will alsoestablish close liaison with theRepresentative of the Secretary-General on IDPs, Francis Deng,particularly in support of his ownadvocacy functions. The Unit will have a great opportunity to make a difference in three particu-lar areas where there have been gapsin the way that the international com-munity has dealt with IDPs. First of allwe need to have more accountabilityin terms of what the international sys-tem does. There are too manyrecommendations, too many missions,too many ideas which are not imple-mented. By ensuring thatrecommendations are actually fol-lowed up, the Unit will add value topresent arrangements. Secondly, we hope to sharpen our response in terms of protection. Themissions of the network have con-cluded that in many cases theprotection response was very weak or,in some places, non-existent. One ofthe first tasks of the Unit will be toestablish a small sub-committee ofagencies dealing with protection. Wewant to discover ways of operational-ising the Guiding Principles onInternal Displacement, to come upwith ways of dealing practically withprotection in situations of internaldisplacement. A third area where we need to move forward quickly is that of solutions.There should be a bigger thrusttowards finding actual solutions tothe problems faced by displaced per-sons. We have seen this happen inplaces where it has been possible toget communities together with author-ities to come forward with solutionsallowing more or less permanent reso-lution of the situation of displacement.At times there is a lack of in-depth analysis and a lack of sensitivitytowards the communities with whomthe UN is supposed to be dealing. Thisin turn leads to a situation where thedesired activities of the UN do nothave the desired impact. Capacitiesexist either within IDP populations orin the wider environment in whichthey live which could be mobilised torespond effectively to the situationsthat we are faced with. We sometimes lack access: the ability to provide IDPs with assistance andprotection. Resources available to usare in many cases deficient. We needto stress the importance of promotingempowerment of IDPs and vulnerablepopulations so that they themselvescan recognise possibilities, recognisetheir aspirations and identify ways ofsupporting the response strategy fordealing with their own situations.Fortunately, there is a growing under-standing that this is a dimension ofthe international community's effortson behalf of vulnerable populationswhich needs to be expanded. I amtalking not only about economicempowerment but also about protec-tion. In Colombia and elsewhere, wehave seen that IDPs can play a keyrole in protecting themselves. In situa-tions where communities were awarethat they were the objects of displace-ment, the fact that they were very wellorganised enabled them to be able towithstand and to foresee the impactof displacement. In some contextsthey were even able to avoid displace-ment, because they were organised. Insome situations, they were able toassert themselves as a communi-ty and, at the same time, claimtheir rights. We think it is necessary to help IDPs to help them-selves, particularlyin the search fordurable solutions.The activities asa starting pointsupport of thecapacities ofthe groupsthemselves. They should aim not just at support- ing them to be resilient but also athelping them promote in a construc-tive manner their recovery andreintegration. We have examples ofhow this has been done. We haveexamples of IDP communities beinghelped to help themselves in Georgia,Azerbaijan and elsewhere in the fieldsof professional training, income-gen-erating activities, credit schemes andso on. As a Unit we will try hard todevelop and expand activities in theseareas. We are planning a review ofactivities in Georgia and Azerbaijan inorder to draw out lessons which canbe applied elsewhere. We want to broaden the UN response, to make it more effective and moretimely. We will also be looking at thewider environment. We will focus onwhat IDPs can do and what opportuni-ties are presented by situations sothat they can respond to their ownneeds. Kofi Asomani collabora- tion they have extended to theRepresentative of the UN Secretary-General on IDPs, FrancisDeng, and for today's programmewhich focuses on aspect internaldisplacement often overlooked: theresponse strategies of IDPs and howthe international community can sup-port them. The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement are an important toolfor IDPs. Presented to the UN in 1998,they are the first international stan-dards for IDPs. They consist of 30Principles which identify the rights ofIDPs and the obligations of govern-ments and insurgent groups towardthese populations. They also provideguidance to all other actors engagedwith IDPs - in particular internationalorganisations and NGOs. They coverallphases of displacement - prior to displacement (the right not to be dis-placed), during displacement andduring return or resettlement andreintegration. They are based on inter-national human rights law,international humanitarian law andrefugee law by analogy. They bring together into one document all theprovisions of international humanrights and humanitarian law relevantto IDPs. What is unique about thePrinciples is that in addition to restat-ing provisions of existing law theytailor the provisions of the law to thespecific needs of IDPs. The Principles were developed by a team of international legal expertsunder the direction of the Represent-ative of the Secretary-General and inconsultation with a wide range ofinternational organisations, NGOs andresearch institutions. Although theyare not a legally binding documentlike a treaty, since their presentationto the UN Commission on HumanRights in 1998 they have fast acquireda good deal of international standing,moral authority and acceptance. Onereason for this is that they are basedon, and are consistent with, bindinglaw. Another reason is the overridingneed for a document relevant to IDPs.Prior to their preparation, there wasno single document to turn to oninternal displacement. International organisations, regional bodies, non-governmental groups anda growing number of governmentshave acknowledged the Principles andare using them as a basis for policyand law. Indeed, a unanimouslyadopted resolution by 53 states during the April 2001 UN Commissionon Human Rights recognised that anincreasing number of states, UN agencies and regional and non-govern-mental organisations are making use of them. The resolution called fortheir further dissemination and application. How can the Guiding Principles support theresponse strategies of IDPs? There are five principal ways. First, the Guiding Principles provide a framework for understanding theproblem. In many countries IDPs do not realise that they have certainrights or that local authorities haveobligations toward them. They are notaware of internal displacement as aphenomenon or do not realise thatpeople in other countries are suffer-ing in the same way and that inter-national approaches are being devel-oped to address the issue. InIndonesia, for example, I found IDPsinterested to learn about a documentthat explained their plight andshowed them that internal displace-ment is a worldwide problem forwhich solutions are being sought andthat there might even be an emerginginternational responsibility towardIDPs. In Macedonia, where I have beenon two different occasions to lead dis-cussions on internal displacement andthe Principles, displaced persons wereinterested in learning more abouttheir situation and how it comparedwith other situations in Europe. ThePrinciples thus are a valuable frame- 17 The Guiding Principles: how do they support IDP response strategies? by Roberta Cohen It is a great pleasure to be in Oslo again. I would like to thank the Norwegian Refugee Council and itsSecretary-General Steinar S\u00f8rlie and the GlobalIDP Project led by Marc Vincent for the importantwork they are doing worldwide for IDPs. I work for promoting a greater under- standing of what is happening topeople when they become forcibly dis-placed. Second, the Guiding Principles are an empowerment tool. When displaced people learn that certain standardsexist which bear on their plight itgives them ideas for empoweringthemselves. Just look at the languageof the Guiding Principles. They assert,for example, that IDPs have the rightto request and receive protection andhumanitarian assistance from nationalauthorities. They speak of participa-tion of IDPs in planning anddistributing supplies and in planningand managing their return and reinte-gration. This is empowermentlanguage. I saw this to be the case inColombia when meeting with a groupof internally displaced women fromall parts of the country. Despite thesecurity threats they faced and thematerial deprivation they suffered,they were heartened to learn that adocument existed with articles specif-ic to their particular needs. Inparticular, Principle 20 on the right ofwomen to have documents in theirown name resonated with thesewomen. This is something they could use, they said. Right now, theBrookings-CUNY Project on InternalDisplacement, which I co-direct, isworking with NGOs in Colombia todevelop an outreach campaign to dis-placed communities based on theGuiding Principles so that these com-munities can better use the Principlesin support of their own responsestrategies. Third, the Guiding Principles are a monitoring tool, a valuable bench- mark for measuring conditions in acountry. At present, a number ofregional and non-governmental organ-isations are monitoring conditions inparticular countries in terms of thePrinciples. Displaced communities canbegin to undertake monitoring aswell. One can see the beginnings ofthis in Colombia, Sri Lanka, Georgiaand Macedonia, where the Principleshave been translated into the locallanguages and outreach programmesare underway. Fourth, the Guiding Principles can serve as an advocacy tool. Of course, this works best when IDPs are alreadyin conditions of relative safety andcan pursue advocacy vis-\u00e0-vis theirlocal and national authorities. In theSouthern Caucasus, for example, IDPs are working together with lawyers inGeorgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia toexamine the laws and regulations intheir countries in terms of theGuiding Principles and to advocate forlegislative reform. When discriminato-ry electoral laws were identified inGeorgia, a group of IDPs made anappeal to the Supreme Court. Whenthe court did not rule in their favour,IDPs together with NGOs appealed tothe government which announced atthe UN that it would explore bringingthis particular law and other laws intoline with the relevant provisions inthe Guiding Principles. Another com-pelling example can be found in SriLanka where an NGO consortium (theConsortium of HumanitarianAgencies) organised a meetingbetween IDP camp commanders andIDP representatives using the GuidingPrinciples as the framework. At themeeting, the representatives of theIDPs advocated for better conditions,in particular more ample food rations,more timely deliveries of food, cleanwater and more personal security inthe camps. They found the Principlesa valuable vehicle for making theirconcerns known. Fifth, the Guiding Principles define 'protection' for IDPs and provide aframework for developing protec-tion strategies. IDPs not only need food, medicine and shelter. They alsorequire protection of their personalsecurity and human rights. Indeed,IDPs often point out that protectionagainst assault, rape and forcedrecruitment is as essential to them asmaterial assistance. While there is nointernational consensus on whoshould undertake protection activitiesin support of the response strategiesof the displaced, the Handbook for Applying the Guiding Principles , pub- lished by the UN and the BrookingsInstitution, does set forth the kinds ofsteps that can be taken to enhanceprotection for IDPs. It contains sec-tions on 'What You Can whichoffers a framework for a protectionstrategy. The Handbook , for example, suggests that channels of communica-tion should be opened betweendisplaced communities and nationalor local authorities and it shows howinternational organisations and NGOscan assist in achieving this. It alsocalls for members of displaced com-munities to visit proposed relocationsites with a view to evaluating theirsafety. On a trip to Angola last year,the Representative of the Secretary- General recommended that NGOs andinternational organisations consultwith displaced populations to developprotection strategies using theGuiding Principles and Handbook as the base. To be widely used, the Guiding Principles will have to be translatedinto local languages. So far, the UNhas translated the Guiding Principlesinto its six working languages. Inaddition, governments, UN agenciesand international and local NGOs havehad the Principles translated into afurther 15 languages. Even this ishardly enough: requests come in regu-larly from different countries. Forexample, there are requests fromUganda to translate the Principles intoGulu for use in IDP camps, from Iraqto translate the Principles intoKurdish, from East Timor to translatethe Principles into Tetum and fromthe Sudan for a Dinka translation.Priority needs to be given to theserequests by the UN and resourcesmade available. The Handbook for Applying the Guiding Principles must also be trans- lated and disseminated in the morethan 40 countries affected by internaldisplacement. Here, an even worsedeficiency exists. The Handbook exists at the UN in published form inEnglish only, even though theHandbook sets forth (and indeed is the only text that does set forth) whatinternational organisations, NGOs andIDPs can do to reinforce responsestrategies. Unfortunately, the UN hasnot fully focused on the importanceof empowering local displaced 18 The Guiding Principles: how do they support IDP response strategies? 19 The Guiding Principles: how do they support IDP response strategies? communities. It has not initiated translations of this booklet into theUN's working languages or developedoutreach strategies to use the bookletin these languages. To fill this gap, the Brookings-CUNY Project has recently had the Handbook translated into French and the UN hasagreed to publish it. Next, we willfund the translation of the Handbook into Russian and will again ask the UNto publish it. In Colombia, NGOs andthe Pan American Health Organisationhave translated the Handbook into Spanish and the Brookings-CUNYProject has agreed to help with thepublication and dissemination of thebooklet in Latin America. However, translations of the Handbook are needed not only into the UN's working languages but alsointo local languages, and outreachcampaigns are needed to disseminatethe Principles to IDPs. Here, some ini-tiative has begun to be shown by the UN. In Indonesia, for example, theOffice for the Coordination ofHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA), togetherwith the Brookings-CUNY Project, is having the Handbook translated into Bahasa Indonesia and an out-reach campaign is being developed byOCHA and OXFAM. This kind of pro-gramme could well be replicated inother countries. In Sri Lanka, with help from UNHCR, the Norwegian Refugee Council andthe Brookings-CUNY Project, an NGOconsortium has published a Toolkit in English, Sinhala and Tamil, based onthe Guiding Principles and theHandbook , to help empower and strengthen the capacities of IDPs. The University of Skopje, with support from UNHCR and theBrookings-CUNY Project, has translat-ed the Principles and the Handbook into Macedonian and Albanian. TheUN must give greater priority to thiseffort and hopefully will do sothrough its newly-formed IDP Unitheaded by Kofi Asomani. Strengthening the response strategies of IDPs is one of the most importantways we can help. As emphasised inthe Norwegian Refugee Council's newbook, Caught Between Borders , IDPs are not just victims but resources. Wemust work to reinforce their capaci-ties and help provide them with thetools they can use to help themselvesand in the languages in which theyneed them. In closing, I would like to recount an experience from the human rightsarena to emphasise the importance ofmaking the Guiding Principles andHandbook available to displaced pop- ulations. Back in the 1970s, throughmy human rights work I had the occa-sion to meet a Soviet dissident whohad been confined to a psychiatrichospital because of his political views.He had been injected with painfuldrugs, abused and partially starved.Because of an international campaign,he was released. When I met him inNew York, I could not help but askhim: \"How did you get through all ofthis?\" In response, he took a crum-pled piece of paper from his backpocket, and said, \"This is how.\" Thepaper was the text of the InternationalCovenants on Human Rights, the UN-adopted standards on civil, political,economic, social and cultural rights.This man had memorised them andknew them by heart. When I asked him how it was possible that this document had sustained himwhen his government did not abide bythe standards in the Covenants, hereplied: \"Oh, they know about them,they adopted resolutions on them atthe UN, in fact they have ratifiedthem, and one day they will have toobserve them.\" Holding up theCovenants, he said, \"This documenthas power.\" He proved to be right. I believe this story should be instruc-tive for today's discussions about theGuiding Principles and how they canreinforce the response strategies ofIDPs. Roberta Cohen is Co-Director ofthe Brookings-CUNY Project onInternal Displacement(www.brook.edu/fp/projects/idp/idp.htm). Email: RCOHEN@brookings.edu Testimony of a displaced woman trained in community protection and conflict resolution at Salga Camp, LuandaProvince, Angola: \"I knew that we had rights, just like any other person. Now that I know exactly what they are, it is my responsibility to ensure that my community understands them too. I am awidow, a mother of four. I never went to school. I am thankful for this opportunity tolearn and teach about our rights. If we know about the Guiding Principles and the[Angolan] Norms [on Resettlement], we know our lives can improve.\"rom this study and other ongo- ing research projects emerge anumber of other themes which are important in the process fromconflict to peace and about which westill have very little knowledge andunderstanding. One that I will beworking on in the coming years is therole of local organisations and institu-tions in helping communities orhouseholds to cope with conflict-induced problems and to grasp newopportunities which present them-selves. Armed conflicts can affect local organisations in numerous ways.Some cease to exist as a result of dis-placement or lack of resources orbecause they are no longer relevant topeople's lives. Others continue toexist but adjust activities and respon-sibilities to suit the newcircumstances. Some find that theirrole and influence are enhanced. War,displacement and new economicforces may give rise to new localorganisations and institutions. Humanitarian agencies have long been interested in building on, supportingand working through local organisa-tions. Arguments in support of thisstrategy variously point to notions of'ownership', 'partnership', 'sustain-ability' or 'accountability'. In practice,humanitarian agencies usually eithersupport and reinforce some existingorganisations (while marginalisingothers) or they create new organisa-tions or institutions after judging thatexisting local NGOs do not have thecapacity or commitment to match theagencies' expectations.Such changes in the organisational and institutional landscape naturallyaffect what kinds of leadershipemerges and how leaders relate to thepopulation at large. Seen from a widerperspective, these processes enable usto get a glimpse of the kinds of futuresocieties and political cultures thatare emerging. For practitioners, themain concerns remain how to developand implement sustainable projectsand to identify suitable partners. Forresearchers the task is to understandsocietal development in its totality orat least from a broader and longerperspective. Research into processes of social and political change in local organisationsand institutions involves seekinganswers to a variety of questions.What are their 'ground rules'? Arethey working toward unity or frag-mentation? Are claims to authoritymade through means of force or dis-tribution? Who do their leaders takeas their role models - kings, rebels,entrepreneurs or administrators? Arethey perceived and judged by the pub-lic in terms of charisma, insight, theirability to access and share resourcesor by their capacity to bring justice?Do organisations and leaders eventu-ally work toward peace or new socialand political conflicts? We need to identify traditional and new organisations and institutions indifferent localities and documentwhat kind of activities they assumeresponsibility for. We need to explorehow different organisations createand define their constituencies andthe kinds of relationship or exchangebetween them. How are their presence and influence negotiated and legit-imised? How do traditional and morerecent forms of leadership and organ-isations relate to each other? Doesone form marginalise the other? Dothey agree upon a division of labouror are they forever locked in conflict? On a more theoretical level the answers which will hopefully emergemay shed new light on the meaning ofterms like University Between Borders:Response Strategies of theInternally Displaced.

F 21 The response strategies of IDPs: questions to be asked by Cathrine Brun hat are the gaps? What are the priorities? Where do wego next? How should we do research with IDPs? Empirical experience from Sri Lanka's protracted crisis of internal displace-ment provides some answers. My PhD project is about the Muslim IDPs whowere expelled by the Liberation Tigersof Tamil Eelam in 1990. After 11years as IDPs they have slimprospects of return in the near future.I have been analysing how thoseinvolved with and affected by dis-placement are creating and recreatingsocial organisation and relationships,livelihood strategies and sense ofplace. In Sri Lanka and elsewhere there is lit- tle knowledge of either why internaldisplacement is often so protracted orhow hosts are involved in and affect-ed by internal displacement. Howdoes the meaning of the IDP categorychange for the people involved withdisplacement? What are the needs andrights of IDPs that should be acknowl-edged at different stages of their dis- placement? Now that researchersunderstand that people who areforced to move do not necessarilybecome powerless and lose their iden-tities, why do we still know so littleabout how power relations and identi-ties change, or do not change, due todisplacement? As time goes on it is not necessarily the case that IDPs and hosts becomemore and more integrated. Evidencefrom Sri Lanka, where the IDP conceptis well known, shows that perpetuat-ing the categories of IDP and non-IDP(in order to access resources from dif-ferent external actors) results in astatic dichotomy which restricts localintegration and normalisation ofsocial relations. In some long-termcases of displacement, the length ofthe displacement may cause furthertensions and the integration processmay be reversed. There should bemore research on the whole history ofintegration processes. We also need to Despite what we think there are huge gaps in our understanding and knowledge of the response strategies of IDPs. WIDPs in Sri Lanka.UNHCR/M Kobayashi22 The response strategies of IDPs: questions to be asked Working Group I: research know more about what happens in an area when humanitarian agencieswithdraw but IDPs remain. Since Chambers wrote in 1986 that the poor are the 'hidden losers' incrises of displacement there has beena rhetorical commitment to includingthe hosts in academic, policy andpractical work. However, very littlesystematic research has been under-taken that actively studies andanalyses the situation of the hostsother than as complementary back-ground actors. More knowledge isneeded on the role of the hosts inprotracted cases of displacement. Amore active and systematic involve- ment of the hosts and a realisationthat actors involved in displacementinclude both the people who flee, thepeople who stay behind and the hostsare needed to get a more holisticunderstanding of crises of internaldisplacement. Studies of the crises of internal dis- placement often tend to emphasisethe civil war or other type of conflictcausing the displacement but payinsufficient attention to social con-flicts among IDPs or between IDPsand their hosts. How to make sense ofsuch social conflicts in times of civilwar is a challenge that requires closer connection with all parties to a con-flict. We need to ask how well we asresearchers and aid workers makesense of people's explanations andrationale on both the causes of con-flicts and of their involvement inthem.

If someone was displaced ten years ago but is nowintegrated into the local community,should they still be considered anIDP? Should there be a cut-off point?In Angola, government policy is to classify people as 'displaced' for thefirst six months after which they arejudged to be 'integrated' even if therehas been no change in their circum-stances. What criteria should we useto differentiate IDPs from other war-affected populations such asdemobilised soldiers, their depen-dants and camp followers, returningrefugees and street children? Is it pos-sible to, and should we, differentiateIDPs from the urban poor? Amid these uncertainties, it is hard to reach agreement on a realistic esti-mate of IDP numbers. The kind ofquantifiable data required by donorsto formulate budgets, policy and pro-grammes is lacking. Compounding these difficulties are political and security-related con-straints on reaching and talking toIDP communities. IDPs are often a sensitive issue for governments whomay be unwilling to cooperate withinformation gathering. The Sudanesegovernment has in the past preventedor frustrated efforts to collect data ondisplaced populations because thedisplaced are perceived as a politicaland security threat to the authorities.This attitude has made it difficult toobtain information about places oforigin, location, numbers, nutritionalstatus and duration of displacement.The government's position has alsocreated difficulties for local researchorganisations working on IDP issues.Some of the data in our chapter onSudan in Caught Between Borders was gathered by a local Sudanese researchorganisation working in collaborationwith the Feinstein InternationalFamine Center at Tufts University. Forsecurity reasons, the name of thisorganisation could not be mentionedin the publication. Governmental sensitivities about IDPs can also lead to disputed informationon such issues as the number of dis-placed persons and their regionaldistribution. In Sudan there is a long-standing disagreement between the Some problems with conducting research on IDPlivelihood strategies by Karen Jacobsen Compared with studying refugees or other research populations, the task of defining what we mean by'IDP' and counting their numbers is fraught withdifficulty. Wgovernment and the UN and interna- tional NGOs over when displacementoccurred, relief strategies and defini-tions of categories. These problemsare exacerbated by weaknesses innational census data. As researchers, advocates and policy makers, we need the following kindsof information in order to supportIDP livelihoods: better data on how many (and who) we are dealing with improved understanding of patterns of movement, andprogressive impoverishment(A widespread pattern is for ruralpeople to move to local towns insearch of security or food andthen, when towns become unsafe,to migrate further afield, perhapstowards the capital, the numbersof those on the move growing asresidents of small towns join theflow.

Is it fear ofrecur ring conflict, landmines, insurgency movements, policies ofgovernments and/or the prospectsof maintaining existing livelihoodand survival strategies?) Finally, we need to ask what kinds of livelihood interventions can realisti-cally be aimed at IDPs. In manyconflict-affected countries, IDPs subsistencefarmers forced off their land intonearby government-controlled townsand cities.

Email:karen.jacobsen@tufts.edu23 Working Group I: research Some problems with conducting research on IDP livelihood strategies The group noted that their group had the smallest number of participants.Does this reflect the apparent lack ofinterest on the part of practitioners/donors in research? Are researchersand practitioners not talking the samelanguage? Definitional problems continue to bedevil research. Is the ICRC's 'war-affected population' a more accurateterm than 'IDP'? What do callreturned refugees who subsequentlybecome displaced? What is the cut-offpoint for being an IDP? Is it helpful tomaintain this identity long after dis-placement? Do IDP and non-IDPcategories restrict integration? Are the large numbers of people dis- placed by development projects andenvironmental change to be thoughtof as IDPs? In places such as Indiaand Sri Lanka, where civil society isactive and the Guiding Principlesbecoming increasingly well known,what is the role of researchers inhighlighting the aspirations of peopledisplaced by dams, mines, forestryprojects or other development pro-jects who might like the protection and publicity accorded by beingrecognised as IDPs? When IDPs become mixed with the urban poor (as in Khartoum), can orshould they be distinguished from therest of the population who are per-haps just as much at risk? In anurban environment, can a rights-based approach identify and targetthose most in need? Is the standard assumption that IDPs are conceptually linked with refugeesnecessarily helpful? Does it obscurethe connections between IDPs andmigrants? Exact numbers of IDPs rarely seem to be of concern to researchers or prac-titioners. Researchers need to tacklethe persistent tendency to bandyaround spuriously-rounded up num-bers of IDPs which are never verified.Thus the 1.4 million IDPs inKhartoum have assumed an iconicsignificance despite the lack of proof.Researchers must help get a betterhandle on numbers.Researchers face serious practical problems in doing research. ThoseIDPs to whom researchers are allowed(by state and non-state actors) to talkare not likely to be the most repre-sentative. Researchers need to bemore explicit about how reachingagreements with governments andnon-state actors can seriously com-promise research findings. The group identified gaps in current knowledge, indicating the need formore empirical research. Theseinclude: What are the pre-flight strategies - commonly from village to townto city - used by those fearingdisplacement? Local community-IDP interactions: more needs to be learned aboutlarger-scale ripple effects and ten-sions over land and otherresources. Getting informationabout hosts is much harder thanabout the displaced butresearchers can do more. Working group I: research Additional issues raisedThe impact of humanitarian assis- tance: in many contexts we do notknow whether humanitarian assis-tance encourages or discouragesthe prospects of return. What isthe impact on existing and newlivelihood strategies? What happens to displaced and local populations when externalfood assistance is suddenly cur-tailed by WFP or other agencies? Are the common, invariably top- down, income-generation andmicro-credit schemes for IDPsreally practical? Do they reflectthe reality that most IDPs are dis-placed farmers struggling to findlivelihoods in urban environ-ments? Are the needs of displacedpastoralists being met? What is meant by self-reliance? What do the variety of agency def-initions and concepts ofself-reliance indicate about thesustainability of interventions? Gender implications of displace- ment and return: what happenswhen women have been empow-ered and/or undertaken newresponsibilities during displace-ment and have this threatened bythe prospect or reality of return?The geographical spread of IDP family/kin links, both nationallyand transnationally, is rarelyexplored. The consequences of international NGOs establishing local organisa-tions in their own images: what isthe effect of creating a new NGOclass skilled in English, use ofcomputers and writing proposals?How they do (co)exist with tradi-tional leadership elites? Recommendations for the IDP research community: Encourage greater employment of local researchers. Examine, where feasible, the scope for the use of the Internetto maintain cyber contact withlocal researchers when access isrestricted by security concerns.Can discussion and protection bepromoted via the Internet? Researchers working as consul- tants for agencies should notnecessarily be constrained by theterms of reference often preparedby HQ-based managers. If theywant to effectively inform pro-gramme interventions,researchers must ask whatagencies really need to know, not just what they think they need toknow. Researchers must challengeassumptions inherent in bureau-cratic agendas. Undertake better mapping of the research environment, puttingagencies and researchers intomore regular contact, thus endingthe all-too-common practice ofagencies employing consultantswho know little or nothing aboutthe country to which they are sent. Ensure that the Guiding Principles are incorporated into all fundingproposals. Promote greater inter-disciplinary cooperation, particularly withpolitical scientists and economists- both of whom are usuallyabsent when IDP programmes areplanned, managed or evaluated. Take a sectoral approach to IDP programmes, not just consideringindividual interventions in isola-tion but also identifying commonvariables. Researchers must learn to be more concise when presentingreports and recommendations.24 NRC/Lars TorjesenAdditional issues raised Working Group I: researche need to further develop data collection methodologyto learn about them. Among the many questions to consider are: Is it possible to count IDPs? Who can and/or should be assisted?Just IDPs? What about the hostpopulation? What about thosewho have stayed behind? Whatissues are sensitive for the com-munity? Why did they flee? Wheredid they come from? How can we listen to IDPs? RRA (rapid rural appraisal) is onemethod but not always the best.Will researchers hear differentresponses than humanitarianagencies? How do we gather and act on local knowledge? Are we aware of the short and long-term social impact of ouractions as external actors? What is the role of local NGOs in enabling access to IDPs? Are we aware of security issues at different levels? In researching the case study of Huambo in Angola presented inCaught Between Borders we asked such questions in order to betterunderstand the experiences of thedisplaced. Though them we gained insight into the causes of their dis-placement, the strategies they chooseand apply during flight and settle-ment and how they experience theiridentity as displaced. Angola is ranked 160th out of 174 countries in the UN HumanDevelopment Index. Every third childdies before the age of five. Civil warhas tormented the country for morethan 25 years. Four million out of apopulation of approximately 12 mil-lion are internally displaced. The 'IDP' identity is a social identity. It is important to note that thosewhom we label as displaced inHuambo have multiple axes of identi-ties, such as woman, the elderly,Ovimbundu (ethnic group), Sambo(a tribe), peasant, head of family,Catholic and supporter of the MPLA(Angola's ruling party). These axeshave different importance at differenttimes and 'displaced' forms only oneaxis of identity for those interviewed. Although many IDPs have experienced several displacements they stillregard their 'displaced' identity as atemporary one. For rural populationsidentity is often deeply embedded inland and agricultural practices. Eventhough the displaced in Huambo havenot fled great distances, they rarelyhave the opportunity to use their for-mer agricultural practices in their newlocation. As a result, they have littleopportunity to practise their normalcultural activities. When asked to identify the cause(s) of their displacement two explanationswere given by IDPS: either guerra (war) or confus\u00e3o (trouble). The inter- weaving of causes - multiple andinterlinked - is evident. Even thoughforced displacement has been a cen-tral part of their daily lives it is notconsidered normal to flee. There is aclear local understanding that there is a significant difference in meaningbetween forced migration and otherforms of voluntary relocation. TheHuambo case illustrates that it is notthe causes of the forced migrationwhich give the displaced their identitybut rather the situation in whichforcibly displaced people find them-selves. When we talk of 'development-induced displacement' or of 'political',economic' or 'environmental'refugees, we impose a kind of differentiation that the displaced inHuambo do not themselves use orrecognise. Both recent and long-termdisplaced identify themselves as tem-porarily displaced. Most have plans toreturn home as soon as possible.Further research is needed to find outmore about the relevance of using thecategories of 'new' and 'old' displaced. Experiences of displacement are dif- ferent from place to place. Clearly,being marginalised in Georgia is dif-ferent than in Angola. We need toconsider what are the social, culturaland economic changes that IDPs haveto cope with. How can these differ-ences be taken into consideration inthe programming of humanitarianNGOs and agencies? For those researching among the dis- placed in Huambo, it was importantto note that most of the displaced inHuambo live outside camps and tran-sit centres. The complex humanitarianemergency and forced displacementhave become the norm for the popu-lation. As the state is so weak, it isthe informal mechanisms among thedisplaced and NGOs that provideopportunities for survival both for theestablished and IDP populations. The displaced are not passive victims but active agents able to formulatedecisions and chose strategies. Thedisplaced population living in campsand transit centres normally put intouse both external assistance and self-help activities in their survivalstrategies. In most camps there is distribution of food (rarely sufficient 25 Working Group II: the humanitarian response IDP response strategies and the humanitarian system by Nina M Birkeland Within each IDP community there is a diverse set of actors and survival and response strategies. W either in terms of calories or variety), soap, blankets, cooking utensils andsome medicines. Salt and clothing areprovided but in insufficient quanti-ties. External assistance is usuallysupplemented by the IDPs' own pro-duce or items bought through workand trade. In Huambo these includefirewood collection, charcoal produc-tion, working for others, manufactureof natural fibre mats, trading offruits, vegetables and staple foods,and farming of 'own' land. The displaced employ many strategies for their protection. Individual storiesof the displaced from the Sambo areanow settled in the village of Vinte-e-Sete near Huambo reveal how peoplefrom the same area chose to flee atdifferent times over a period of threeto four months. Other protection deci-sions which the displaced had tomake as actors included the directionin which to flee, the route to followand whether to flee in groups or indi-vidually. Their decisions were basedupon assessment of costs and bene-fits. It is, for example, faster to flee byroad but this adds to the risk of rob-bery by both UNITA and government soldiers. In the decision-makingprocess, IDPs put to use previous per-sonal experiences of flight andcollective knowledge about forced dis-placement. From the interviews it isevident that different people madedifferent choices of protection strate-gies when exposed to the samestructural circumstances. A majorproblem is that many do not have thedocuments that would give them theopportunity to flee to the relativelysafer areas along the coast or to thelarger towns and cities in the region. Since no IDP can be sure that external actors will provide assistance, self-help strategies are uppermost. Almostall assistance in the region is financedthrough emergency programmes lack-ing any long-term perspective. Othercharacteristics of self-help activitiesare that they are based on low capitalinvestments, are easy to relocate ifand when the displaced have to moveon and that they provide an outcomeon a daily basis. For the IDPs livingoutside camps the self-help activitiesare more or less the same, except thattheir own food production plays a more important role in the dailystruggle for survival. Almost all self-help strategies devel- oped and used by the IDPs areoriented towards the short term.People need an outcome now, not inthe future, even though a long-termperspective could be more profitable.The displaced know this themselves.Until such time, however, as they canmove away from the desperate strug-gle for survival to a situation wherethey can focus on developing sustain-able livelihoods, short-termperspectives are likely to predomi-nate.

UNHCR/W Rappeport27 Working Group II: the humanitarian response he humanitarian community has to seriously re-think itspolicies and strategies in mounting a humanitarian response tothe needs of IDPs and, indeed, othertarget populations. I would propose the following four priority areas and initiatives as essen-tial to improve the quality ofhumanitarian response. Access While Caught between Borders high- lights a number of important lessonson how IDPs develop strategies torespond to their displacement, thisnew awareness should not detractfrom the reality that humanitarianorganisations do not have access inmany of the country situations por-trayed in the book. It must not beforgotten that in countries such asBurma, Burundi, Sri Lanka and Sudangovernment authorities do everythingthey can to obstruct internationalorganisations from reaching IDPs.Access must be top of the agenda.Protection The recent missions of the SeniorNetwork on Internal Displacementillustrate that the biggest gap in theresponse to IDPs is protection. Yetthere is considerable confusion overwhat constitutes protection and howit relates to humanitarian assistance. Nowadays many humanitarian organi- sations, including NGOs, recogniseprotection-related activities as being apart of their work, for example in theform of advocacy. At the headquar-ters level, several initiatives have beentaken by UNHCR, the ICRC and NGOsto discuss their respective roles inprotection. At the same time, howev-er, many field staff fear thatincorporating human rights and pro-tection elements in their work will putat risk their operational presence andwill impact negatively upon negotia-tions for humanitarian access. There is much that can be done. The Guiding Principles can serve as achecklist in assessing humanitarianneeds. In the course of their workNGOs compile considerable practicaldata which can be used to formulateindicators to measure human rightsviolations. Another initiative whichhas been taken by some NGOs is torecruit specific staff to help opera-tional colleagues to collect andanalyse this information. Rights-based approach and the Sphere Project Perhaps similar to the protection debate is the present emphasis placedon developing a rights-based approach to responding to humanitar- ian needs. As Hugo Slim hasobserved, \"rights dignify individuals,rather than patronising them, and vic-tims of conflict become claimants ofrights rather than objects of charity.\"A rights-based approach groundshumanitarian action in a legal frame-work which sets out duties andresponsibilities and which thereforealso provides a framework withinwhich actors can be held accountable. One tool in developing a rights-based approach may be the Sphere Project. 1 Its Humanitarian Charter explains thebasic notions and principles ofhumanitarian action and is followedby a set of minimum standards, indi-cators and guidance notes in fivetechnical areas: food distribution,nutrition, shelter, water and sanita-tion, and healthcare. Sphere may be ahelpful tool in assessing needs, plan-ning, monitoring and evaluatingresponse, advocacy and training. Onestandard consistently put forward bythe Sphere Handbook is the involve-ment of the beneficiary population inprogramme design and operations.This principle is also crucial ifhumanitarian response is to build onand strengthen the capacity of theaffected populations and local organi-sations. Another interesting issue with regard to IDPs and Sphere is the apparent Improving the quality of humanitarian response by Ed Schenkenberg van Mierop The stories in Caught between Borders perfectly illustrate how much - or, rather, how little - weactually know about how people who are forciblydisplaced from their homes cope with their situationand what sort of mechanisms they develop in orderto survive and rebuild their lives. TAdditional issues raised Working Group II: the humanitarian response relation between the Guiding Principles and minimum standards inhumanitarian assistance. Principle 18and section IV of the GuidingPrinciples provide for a right for IDPsto receive certain forms of humanitar-ian assistance essential for humansurvival. In years to come Sphere maywell be recognised as having set thestandards on what constitutes suchassistance. Accountability NGOs hold the issue of accountabilityto be crucial in improving the interna-tional response to IDPs. In the UNsystem it seems that every actor canhide behind somebody else, thus passing the buck for failures toaddress the assistance and protectionneeds of IDPs. NGOs must continue toensure that IDPs no longer fallthrough the cracks of the internation-al system. On another level, humanitarian organ- isations seem to have accepted thenotion that they are not only account-able towards their donors, be itprivate or institutional, but also to thepeople they help to survive. Part ofthis concept of accountability is therelationship with local organisationsand structures. As Mary B Andersonhas observed, external aid alwaysleads to inequalities and dependen- cies. However, if humanitarian aid isto do more good than harm, interna-tional organisations and NGOs mustbuild their responses upon the capaci-ties of the IDPs themselves, as well ason the capacities of local organisa-tions and structures. Ed Schenkenberg van Mierop isthe ICVA(www.icva.ch). Email: ed.schenkenberg@icva.ch 1 See www.sphereproject.org.28 One of the main issues discussedrelated to the image of IDPs as vic- tims. What can be done to dispel this image and change our perspective? Isthis a wider problem relating to mostgroups of people receiving assistance?How can we support IDPs in such away that their own self-image isrestored and they regain control overtheir lives? To avoid stigmatising groups of peo- ple, it is important to focus on arights-based approach, using humanrights as the basis in planning andimplementing humanitarian assis-tance. Such an approach allows us tosee IDPs as rights holders, not vic-tims. The Sphere Project 1is an important initiative because it inter-nalises this rights-based approach.The importance of involving IDPs inthe design - as well as the implemen-tation - of projects was underlined. Categorising of groups and categoris- ing of situations can sometimes makethings worse. We categorise our targetgroups into IDPs, refugees, vulnerablegroups and so on; and we categoriseour response in terms such as emer-gency situation or developmentphase. Sometimes this leads us tomiss some important issues. How can we improve our response and develop field activities based onresponse strategies? Information gathering and dissemina- tion is of key importance. IDPsdepend on survival mechanisms andtheir ability to adapt. We need to gaina better understanding of copingstrategies among IDPs. We shoulddevelop greater awareness of how dif-ferent groups and individuals are ableto survive and use this informationwhen planning assistance. We need toask what previous structures existedfor decision making and what IDPs'current procedures are. What are theirinputs into the economy, their hostfamilies or host communities? Weneed to develop a methodology forinformation gathering and tools forunderstanding the communities inwhich we work. Agencies coulddevelop a 'toolbox' of data collectionmethods and train local staff/localNGOs how to use and develop them. Existing and new information needs to be gathered and made accessible.This should be done in close coopera-tion with the research community. Itis essential that we include localresearchers. The need for an interdis-ciplinary approach is vital. It is hopedthat the joint NRC-NTNU database oncompleted and ongoing IDP research which is about to be established, willbegin to meet these needs. 2 Another priority is to find better waysof combining protection and assis-tance. The UN and NGOs must alsofocus more on gaining access to thoseIDP populations that are out of reachof international humanitarian organi-sations because of security issues. The importance of improved coordi- nation between different UNorganisations and international NGOswas underlined. This should be theresponsibility of Humanitarian/Resident Coordinators and theyshould be trained to do so. An overallplan for assistance should be made ineach country with set standards andspecific monitoring responsibilitiesfor different agencies clearly spelledout. Better mechanisms are alsoneeded in terms of accountability.Working towards a single inter-agency assessment in humanitarianemergencies should be a long-termgoal. 1 www.sphereproject.org 2 See information box on p46.Working group II: The humanitarian response Additional issues raised29 Working Group III: Listening ensions at both the family and the community level can mani-fest themselves in various ways, such as reduced participationby leaders (formal and non-formal) inmeetings, increased female attendanceat meetings and in aid distribution,gradual reduction in numbers ofyoung people in the camps, conflictand harassment of women in thecamps, attitude and behaviour disor-ders and trauma and, at the extremeend, attacks on humanitarian andrelief staff. Through Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) exercises, the following causesof such tensions in Burundi wereidentified: i. Disempowerment of community traditional leaders The existing community structure views the humanitarian assistancestructure as a threat to their tradition-al community leaders as it reduces, orremoves, their social power and sta-tus. Silent boycott at the beginningand open conflict later on are mani-festations of their coping mechanismto regain power and authority.ii. Role reversals (gender and generation) In many African communities, men and women are expected to fulfil cer-tain roles and responsibilities. Womenare responsible for domestic work andchildcare whereas men are responsi-ble for productive activities andprotection of the family. In the case ofrelief response, it is normally the headof household (male) who has to beregistered by the relief agency; there-fore he will be the one to queue forfood and non-food aid. In his commu-nity he is supposed to be seen as aprovider but in this case he is therecipient; this is humiliating for himand the reversal of roles is sociallyunacceptable for both men and women. It is the parents' responsibility to feed, clothe and protect their children.In an emergency situation, however,parents can no longer play this rolefully; in some cases, it may even bereversed as children take on theparental responsibility for getting anincome for the whole family. Youngmen and women are often sent bytheir parents to find paid employmentin cities. iii. ShelterShelter provided in camps is usually too small to accommodate the wholefamily. Older children cannot sharethe small piece of sheeting with theirparents and therefore either thefather or the older children have tofind alternative accommodation. Inthe process, parents lose their educa-tional role and their control over thewhole family unit. iv. Traditional rituals and religious practices The change in family life and situation also presents cultural challenges. Inthe new environment, families cannotcarry out their traditional and reli-gious rituals. At worst, displacedpeople may not able to conduct prop-er grieving and funeral ceremonieswhile they are in the camps. This gen-erates great fear that the spirits ofdead relatives will haunt thembecause they have not observed theirtraditions. What can be done to reduce tensions? From the author's experience, those working to reduce tension should beaware of tensions which may arisefrom displacement conditions andoperational approaches implementedby humanitarian and relief organisa-tions. Management structures atcommunity/camp level, district/provincial level and national levelshould be set up. Displaced peopleshould be involved in identification oftensions and alternative solutionsand, above all, in decision making onissues which affect them. Management structures At the national level, management isprimarily a question of policy, advoca-cy and coordination. Humanitarianassistance organisations need to setup coordination mechanisms thatdefine roles and responsibilities,strategies and approaches, and appro-priate interventions. This includessetting up structures that will enablethem to listen to and involve the com-munity. At the district/provincial level, man- agement is more operational,involving needs assessment, capacitybuilding, implementation and evalua-tion. The operational strategy shouldAddressing tensions and building appropriate supportstructures by Salvator Nkurunziza In many cases, as outsiders, we may see the effects - though not necessarily the causes - of tensions thatarise in the community. Tirstly, and most importantly, the element of change is crucial to understand if we are to imple- ment effective strategies to addressdisplaced people's needs. Change mayrelate, for example, to people's healthstatus. Some people are traumatised by the events that caused them toflee; some have been abused andexploited during flight. They may beill or exhausted. Or changes may haveoccurred in their social status, such aswhen professionals can no longerpractise their profession. Moreover,traditional networks of support, suchas family and community, have beendestroyed, leaving some members(women, children, disabled) especiallyvulnerable. In general, changed cir-cumstances often mean that peoplecannot do what they are used to orwould want to. Sometimes thesechanges may affect what for us seeminsignificant issues, such as food; forthem, however, that can be of greatimportance.Secondly, people react to events/expe- riences in accordance with what itmeans to them. In other words, reac-tions are result of cultural context, which may transform individual expe-rience; the same signs and symptoms,for example, may mean differentthings in different social settings. Thirdly, in times of disaster, the focus is on rapid delivery of goods and ser- vices. Important though this is,however, it is often undertaken withlittle or no reference to the capacityof the population to help itself andwith no participation by the affectedpopulations. Moreover, there is a lackof coordination, further diminishingthe capacity of the displaced popula-tion as well as the possibility for hostcommunities to contribute and bene-fit. This can ultimately undermine thecoping mechanisms of the affectedpopulations, denying them the dignityof self-reliance and creating long-termdependency.be a joint intervention involving all specialised humanitarian organisa-tions to avoid duplication andconflicting approaches that might cre-ate confusion and tension at thecommunity level. At the affected community level, the operational team must recognise thatdisplaced communities would alreadyhave their own organisational struc-tures - formal and/or informal.Examples of traditional authority inAfrica include the Bashingantahe inBurundi, Paramount Chiefs in WestAfrica and Gacaca in Rwanda. Insteadof starting from scratch, therefore,the operational team should identifyand build on the existing communityleadership structures. How do we set up management struc- tures at the community level in campsfor displaced people? During theassessment phase, the following ques-tions should guide the assessmentteam:Are there any existing formal and/or informal structures? How have issues of gender and generation been considered vis-\u00e0-vis representation? Concerning geographical repre- sentation, are all communities/areas affected represented in thecommittee and are they involvedin decision making? Are the most vulnerable displaced persons represented in the exist-ing community managementcommittee/structure and involvedin decision making? What resources, capacities and skills do the existing structureshave and what gaps are there thatneed to be fulfilled? What will be the role and respon- sibilities of the managementcommittee? Answers to the above questions could be sought via exercises such as map-ping, Venn diagrams and SWOT(Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunitiesand Threats) analysis. These will helpthe affected communities and the assessment team, working together, toidentify the gaps, resources andcapacities of the communities andwhat is required of the humanitarianorganisations. Conclusion Tensions arise from the conditionscreated by displacement and are rein-forced by top-down interventions.Unless we make an effort to identify,work with and build on the capacitiesof existing structures, and therebymore effectively minimise tensions,humanitarian interventions will beless than effective in listening andresponding to the needs of the dis-placed.

F31 Working Group III: Listening Additional issues raised The sources of tensions inside and outside IDP camps may stem from thedisempowerment of traditional leader-ship, a reversal of pre-displacementgender and generational roles, theexodus of young people or behaviour-al problems and violence. Agenciesneed not only to listen to how IDPsidentify sources of tension but also toreflect that awareness in the struc-tures established to address andprevent them. Different managementstructures are needed at different lev-els. While they should try to buildwherever possible on existing mecha-nisms, it should be remembered thatsome traditional structures do notnecessarily address the needs of themost vulnerable. Policies that effectively listen to and respond to IDPs' needs must look attheir real needs and real capacities.Agencies need to understand firstlythat all displacement involves change,both physical and psychological; accu-rate information about the nature ofthese changes is essential prior to for-mulating interventions. Secondly,agencies need to understand the cul-tural context in which these changesare taking place in order for interven-tions to be culturally appropriate andto accord with IDPs' wishes and prior-ities. Thirdly, they should identify IDPcapacities and involve them in inter- ventions. In all these areas, thegathering of accurate informationplays a crucial role; misinformation orwrong information can have dire con-sequences. There is need for a note of caution regarding the empowerment ofwomen. As women are increasingly recognised as resilient actors, often taking onboth livelihood and additional fami-ly/child care roles in displacement,the tendency - and fashion - is foragencies to focus on projects to'empower' women via education,training or income-generation initia-tives. Women could spend all theirtime on such activities, foreverenhancing their empowerment.International organisations tend tofind it easier to fund and implementprojects involving women with theresult that there are hardly any pro-jects targeting men. This contributes toan increase in inactivity, drinking, vio-lence and other antisocial behaviour. Gender is not only about women's roles but also about male/female rela-tions. Agencies need to be more awareof the related needs and possibleareas of tension arising from displace-ment. They should consider develop- ing complementary projects, learningfrom examples such as the case inBosnia where a weaving scheme wasset up for women while men beingcontracted to make the looms. The increase in reconciliation projects reflects another fashion in interven-tions. Millions of dollars have beenpoured into reconciliation projectswithout, perhaps, sufficient awarenessof whether the timing has been appro-priate. Again, agencies need tounderstand a situation and developappropriate interventions, rather thansimply following fashions. Bearing the above in mind, as trainerswe first try to identify both observ-able change and people's perceptionof the change. At the level of needs,we try to include what people need aswell as how they want it. In definingthe overall approach, we start withwhat resources exist within the popu-lation and build on those. In short, our approach to training is value-driven and based on partici-pants' analysis of what is mostrelevant and manageable in the lightof their current capacities and resources. We recognise that trainingis a continual process and not some-thing learned as the result ofattending one or two workshops.Training needs to fit into a larger pic-ture and process. We work withpeople to define that larger picture inorder to determine how a trainingcourse can contribute to it. Participation is a major factor in determining whether or not the pro-ject will be successful. Failure toinvolve people will ultimately lead to growing lethargy on the part of thepopulation, increase in cost anddecrease in communication.

Email:paklar@icmc.net Working group III: Setting up structures that listen to the needs of the displaced Additional issues raisedwould like to discuss the liveli- hood of IDPs against a backgroundof how conditions of mobility and livelihoods in general change in situa-tions of armed conflict. During armedconflict, mobility and control ofmobility are of primary strategicimportance for everybody involved.The changing patterns of mobilityduring and after conflict should beseen in this context. Displacement oflarge parts of the population is a com-mon feature of armed conflict.Sometimes parties to the conflict usedisplacement as a military strategy forterritorial or population control; atother times displacement is an out-come of widespread conditions ofinsecurity and impoverishment. In thePeruvian Andes, as in many places,mobility is an essential aspect oflivelihoods. Difficulty in travelling cantherefore cause impoverishment, asaccess to markets, education andmigrant work is limited. Many people fleeing regions of armed conflict live in precarious conditionsand are often viewed with much sus-picion or even hostility by both theirnew neighbours and the authorities.Although the framework for the pro-tection of IDPs is still much weakerthan the refugee framework, theappointment of the Representative of the UN Secretary General for IDPs andthe publication of the GuidingPrinciples have served to increaseinternational attention on the subject. In order to probe possible effects and implications of such attention, theCDR project has explored how the IDPconcept was introduced in Peru in theearly 1990s and appropriated by localNGOs, people affected by violent con-flict and displacement, and by agovernmental organisation, Programade Apoyo al Repoblamiento (PAR).PAR was set up to facilitate returnand repopulation at the end of armedconflict. Learning about the IDP con-cept has encouraged and enabledlocal and national IDP organisationsto speak out about their needs andrights, and to receive different formsof assistance, including support forreturn. Our research indicates that those agencies and programmes that havebeen working in support of IDPs havetended to disregard the mobile liveli-hood practices of both IDPs andreturnees. These groups of people frequently engage in seasonal migra-tion or seek to re-establishrural-urban linkages by living in bothcity and village, building up dual resi-dence whenever possible after'returning' to the villages. The agen-cies and programmes, however, haveseen this mobility as an impedimentto advocacy and longer-term develop-ment strategies. IDPs and returneesare expected to stay in one place. Our research suggests that, ratherthan considering displacement (andreturn) as an absolute break with thepast, a focus on networks and mobile livelihoods may be a better way tohelp people affected by violent con-flict to move beyond emergency relief.

Iowever, the distinctions between the two are blurred:conflicts tend to be pro- longed and the aid system is notalways particularly sensitive to whenand why one type of support - relief -ends and another - development -begins. Agencies need to addresssimultaneously both the immediateneeds and the longer-term require-ments of displaced communities. A new proposal for the Norwegian aid budget proposes support that mayovercome traditional distinctionsbetween relief and development, ( overgangs- bistand ). NGOs and voluntary agencies should explore the potential of thistype of support. What does the concept of 'livelihood' mean and what does it imply in termsof assistance? Generally, we refer tolivelihoods as a means of living, anincome. In development studies, theconcept normally goes beyond theeconomic and denotes a wide range ofmeans and ways to survive and to sus-tain people's existence at a given place.Richard Black 1writes about the need to protect 'livelihood environ ment'.The failure to protect the physical environment will make it more diffi-cult for refugees to find essentialcommodities, especially if they are inexile for a long period, and may con-tribute to malnutrition, disease andenhanced poverty. 'Livelihood envi-ronment' refers both to people'simmediate surroundings - their needfor basic items such as wood, grazingland and water - and to infrastructureneeds such as roads, schools and clin-ics. Finn Stepputat and BirgitteS\u00f8rensen write of 'mobile livelihoods',referring to the existing levels ofmobility between sites of production,sites of wage labour and temporarymigration. 2 There is need for clarification andnuancing of the concept of livelihoodstrategies. Livelihood systems are cul-turally and socially unique. Whendeveloping support policies, donorsshould acknowledge people's tradi-tional strategies and should serve asfacilitators. Historical and new liveli- hood strategies Traditionally, poor people's strategies reflected their desire to spread riskrather than increase their output fromone source only. In times of conflict,such reasoning and resulting strate-gies may provide the mostappropriate knowledge base for sur-vival for IDPs. Knowledge of thesocio-economic and cultural charac-teristics of IDPs is essential forlong-term capacity building and socialreconstruction. Against this background, Stepputat and S\u00f8rensen's suggestion that pro-grammes should focus on people'snetworks and mobile strategies, build-ing on what is 'at hand', may be anappropriate way to help people affect- ed by violent conflict and to movebeyond emergency relief. However,such a strategy may also sustain thedifferences between different types ofIDPs, as some may have better accessto supporting networks and resourcesthan others. It is vital to ensure that the needs of the host populations are alsoaddressed. Programmes could, forexample, promote legal rights todevelop business and work for bothgroups, ensure everybody's mobility,clarify use rights to resources, identi-fy the priorities of both groups andtry to avoid conflicting agendas. Practical needs versus strate- gic interests In our research on IDPs at NTNU we have decided to pursue an actor-oriented approach. This meansemphasising the enabling capacity ofthe individual, indicating that IDPsmay influence their own situationeven at times of extreme deprivation. However, such emphasis on agency should not ignore the structuralaspects of flight and deprivation.Rather, it should concentrate on iden-tifying the enabling structures rather than the constraining ones. This is a major challenge: how to assist IDPs asindividuals and as a group by serviceprovision, and at the same time pro-vide changes in the supportstructures that in the long run mayengender changes in the system. This brings us to the discussion of how IDPs may be empowered toimprove their situation and to changeit in the long run. The terms 'practicalneeds' and 'strategic interests' arenormally associated with the dis-course on empowerment of gender.Both are needed to create sustainablelivelihoods. By practical needs wemean shelter, food and service provi-sion. By strategic needs we mean howwe may sensitise people and mobilisethem collectively in order for them toidentify how they can change their34 Creating livelihoods for IDPs: some conceptual and practical considerations by Ragnhild Lund The focus on livelihoods derives from the debate on 'from relief to development' and the distinctionwhich it makes between what is short-term/immediate and long-term/sustainable. HWorking Group IV: Livelihoodssituation. The latter takes time, and again marks the difference betweenrelief (service provision and immedi-ate needs) and development (how tocreate positive structural and individ-ual change, meet longer-term needsand encourage sustainability). Bothpractical needs and strategic interestsneed to be seen as complementary,whereby meeting practical needs mayresult in creating preconditions forstrategic moves and empowerment. Agencies need to be active in creating tools for identification of practicalneeds and strategic interests and informulating measures to achieve abroader approach to livelihood cre-ation which uses participatorymethodology to identify changes inthe support structure through partici-patory methodology and improvesaccess to natural resources, food pro-duction and economic resources. New and old conflicts IDPs currently number 20-25 million.In 1992 the figure was 24 million.Numbers are not increasing but arenot dropping significantly either.When conflict erupts and people haveto flee their homes and ancestralplaces, some are identified as IDPs and are entitled to support, while oth-ers have to fend for themselvesoutside the migration mainstream.The present classification of IDPsdoes not cover all affected groups. Formany, the status of IDP is a transition-al situation: when does it start andwhen does it end? Furthermore, howshould early warning systems be for-mulated to be effective in pre-warsituations? The challenges relating toour thinking on livelihoods and aidare multi-faceted and relate to severalstages of displacement; as Dengemphasises, the Guiding Principlesshould be used as a basis for dialogueon these issues with governments andother actors. We all need to develop alonger-term perspective. From these last points, several further recommend-ations emerge: Registration and classification of IDPs must be improved and tai-lored to specific geographical andcultural contexts. The Guiding Principles need to be reformulated and contextualisedprior to implementation.Programmes and aid activities should not be isolated from offi-cial development policies. Stronger links with governments should be developed. NGOs (local and international) must be strengthened to work ina complementary manner andfacilitate measurement ofimpacts. Inter-agency coordination needs to be made more effective, allow-ing flexible strategic planning. Finally, there is the challenge of 'keeping in touch' with IDPs andhost communities, and the needto create channels for effectivelong-distance communication.

All situations of IDPs are different. It is important to contextualise andidentify the social and cultural struc-tures among IDP and hostcommunities and how they interact.When looking at the differencebetween IDPs and refugees, it becameapparent that often IDPs might bebetter equipped to work on recon-structing social and culturalstructures than refugees who findthemselves in foreign lands withoutknowledge of social and politicalstructures. When we talk of IDPs there are pre- vailing general assumptions ofimmobility and discontinuity. Ourconceptions of discontinuity have for the in whichdevelopment-oriented assistance forrefugee and IDPs has been conceived.Our responses fall into threecategories. Either IDPs are assisted atthe site of refuge with the intention that this is where they will perma-nently settle; or they are kept inlimbo, forever receiving relief untilsuch time as conditions are ripe forreturn or resettlement; or, thirdly,they are assisted in ways whichprepare for their future by providingthem with transportable assets, edu-cation, training or organisationalskills. There is a challenge in the fact that although the state of discontinuity isoften real it is at the same time areduction of reality which has impli-cations for assistance and relationsforged between IDPs, returnees andthose who stay. The importance ofmobility for commercial relations,education and migrant labour impliesthe need to capture how mobility isembedded in livelihood practices.Conventional thinking often seesrefugees and IDPs in terms of securi-ty. Spatially restrictive regimes ofhumanitarian assistance may denyrecipients the right to move aroundand disqualify them from makingclaims to special victim status.Livelihoods may be disrupted in manyways. There are risks that:markets become inaccessible labour opportunities are restricted long distance control of assets becomes difficult rural-urban exchanges of food, building materials and informa-tion are blocked leaders cannot represent their people as they cannot reachurban centres of power secondary and higher education opportunities in urban centres aredenied to IDPs We need to do much more to learn about displaced livelihoods and howto improve freedom of movement andprospects for their normalisation. We must not forget that IDPs are a symptom of profound problems thatneed to be addressed. We have toproactively tackle the causes of dis-placement. Power struggles, fragileand undemocratic states and lack oftransparency and equality in systemsand structures of distribution are rootcauses of poverty. Conflict, globalisa-tion and environmental degradationwill continue to increase the numbersof IDPs unless we take action.

The international presence in Colombia has been oriented towardsprotection and rights, perhaps moreso than in many other so-called com-plex emergencies. This is mainly dueto a strong national human rightsmovement of NGOs, grassroots organ-isations and other social movementsthat existed prior to the increase ininternational presence around 1996-97. There has been some innovatory cooperation between internationalNGOs and intergovernmental organi-sations to meet the protection needsof IDPs and the civilian population.Supporting and monitoring of negotia-tion, support of local early warningsystems and setting up common pro-tection agendas have been some ofthe ways in which these protectionneeds have been addressed.Support for Peace Communities The best known organised self-protec- tion movements in Colombia are the'peace communities' ( Paz) and Communities in Resistance en Resistencia ) in Urab\u00e1. These emerged after intensefighting between government forcesand the Revolutionary Armed Forcesof Colombia (FARC) in 1997 led to thefirst massive displacement and subse-quent threats and massacres byparamilitary groups. The initial objective of the movement was to keep the civilian populationout of the armed conflict by declaringcivilian autonomy vis-\u00e0-vis armedgroups. That autonomy involvedorganising the community democrati-cally and formulating and adhering toself-imposed restrictions on carryingarms, passing information to armedfactions or in any other way support-ing the armed groups. It was hopedthat, by doing so, those displaced andliving in camps in Pavarand\u00f3 andTurbo would be able to return to theirhomes and future displacement wouldbe prevented. The peace communities negotiated with paramilitaries and guerrillasthrough third parties, mainly thechurch. The armed groups agreed notto attack the communities. Similaragreements made with governmenttroops were commu-nity in thegovernment's responsibility for pro-viding protection and security andnegotiated an unarmed state presence (the 'house of justice', which includesan ombudsman and a finance office). The peace communities designed sym- bols to designate the member villagesand individuals. Signs were erectedoutside villages and 'camps'. Memberscarry ID cards affirming that theybelong to the community and thatthey do not carry arms and do notparticipate in the armed conflict. TheID cards have proven to be importantassets for travel through the region asholders of those cards pass easilythrough the numerous checkpointsset up by each faction. As another way of protecting them- selves and their right to freedom ofmovement, members of the peacecommunities travel in groups andwork collectively on such tasks asplanting, road repair and fruit har-vesting. Teams of missionaries andNGO staff often accompany peacecommunity members in their tasks,providing another level of protection. Most of these communities are Afro- Colombian and, as recognisedminorities, enjoy particular rights, themost important of which are collec-tive land rights, including the right touse surrounding natural resources.Titulaci\u00f3n , or the legal registration of collective property, is crucial forreclaiming their land once the dis-placed return.

Hsteadily increasing but is still very limited compared to the scope andmagnitude of the humanitarian crisis. When asked what they most need, IDP communities (despite the fact thatthey have many material needs) mostoften request presence and accompa-niment. Peace Brigades International 1 have had the most direct accompani-ment role, as they have beencontinuously with some communitiesduring and after return. Other organi-sations (UN and international NGOs)have attended larger meetingsbetween the communities in order togive visibility, prestige and some secu-rity. These meeting have alloweddialogue between the displaced com-munities and representatives of theinternational community. The Cacarica Community and the gov- ernment created a joint commissionto negotiate conditions for return andto undertake the planning and moni-toring of the actual return process.The community invited national andinternational organisations to serve as observers. National NGOs have hadthe most proactive role in supportingthe community in negotiating anagreement. The international presencehas offered legitimacy to the commu-nity and their claims and at timesfunctioned as a buffer between thecommunity and the government.Protection issues have been a priority,for the community, the NGOs and theinternational agencies. Direct involve-ment was complemented by fundingof the whole negotiation process.International NGOs supported theorganising of the community, as wellas financing the costs of negotiation. Return to the places of origin took place amid escalating conflict in theregion, thus increasing protectionneeds. Return was relatively success-ful; thousands of people were able to go home and large communitiesgained formal ownership of the land.However, the return process has hadits costs. The communities have suf-fered attacks and harassment.Advocacy and international supporthave been crucial in preventing fur-ther escalations and new large-scaledisplacement. The peace communities' developed organisation and own capacity toanalyse security risks and defineadvocacy agendas have always beenthe basis for advocacy. The protection challenge of individually displaced people While the peace communities in Urab\u00e1 were organised communities withdefined collective protection agendasand good negotiation skills, most dis-placed persons in Colombia seekrefuge individually or in small groups.The pattern of displacement is com-plex. In one town some families canbe arriving, seeking protection andsecurity, while at the same time sever-al other families are fleeing. Most displaced persons in Colombia face a high degree of insecurity evenafter displacement. In towns andcities like C\u00facuta andBarrancabermeja, the risk of beingpersecuted and even killed is so highthat many of the displaced choose tohide their identity as IDPs. Silence andanonymity are often necessary andperceived as the only way to survive.This strategy will most often result inlack of access to public services andhumanitarian attention, and noresponsibility taken by the authoritiesto protect the IDPs. External humani-tarian actors, including internationaland national NGOs, have difficultyreaching a population that will not identify itself as displaced. Even when silence and anonymity are most common self-protection strate-gies, IDP families will look fortrustworthy structures for supportand guidance. At its most basic, suchstructures are relatives or friends inpoor neighbourhoods. More importantfor protection and assistance are localparishes, women's organisations,neighbourhood committees and othergrassroots organisations. For international organisations, alliances and support for these organ-isations and structures will often bethe only way to support displacedpopulations. The need for financialand institutional strengthening of theorganisations is often overlookedwhen both protection and humanitari-an assistance are discussed. Whenneeded, visible international supportshould be provided but always afterdiscussion with local partners and thedisplaced communities. Visibility andpresence can often function as deter-rents but in certain situations suchvisibility can be counterproductiveand actually trigger persecution orattacks. It is obvious that the onlyway to ensure that a certain interven-tion will have protection impact, andnot constitute potential harm to thecommunity, is through acquiringknowledge and information aboutself-protection mechanisms. For this,continuous dialogue is needed withthe displaced persons themselves,their organisations and other localactors. Most important are awarenessof and interest in detecting protectionneeds and self-protection strategies. Humanitarian responses should be adapted to self-protection mecha-nisms. In situations of individual 38 Strengthening of response strategies to improve protection for IDPs Working Group V: Protection Village destroyed by paramilitaries, Colombia. UNHCR/J Spaull39 Working Group V: Protection Strengthening of response strategies to improve protection for IDPs displacement and where anonymity is used in self-protection, one responseis to increase local actors' capacity toassist in a low-key manner. In somepilot projects, and ProjectCounselling Services (PCS) havedefined local 'protection agents' andprovided them with small protectionfunds to be used flexibly according toeach family's needs. In some areas, like Urab\u00e1, Magdalena Medio and the North East, some inter-national actors have managed todefine common protection agendasthrough establishment of informalroundtables. International NGOs andUN agencies undertake common mis-sions to areas with difficult access, with the main objective of meetingwith local organisations, churches anddisplaced communities to discuss pro-tection problems and challenges. Thedefinition of common advocacy agen-das and protection activities amonglocal actors and international net-works has proven much moreeffective, particularly in giving legiti-macy to the local actors. International agencies will often have easier access to regional and nationalmilitary and civil authorities and theroundtables have used this access tovoice general and specific protectionconcerns. International early warningsystems will always be most timely and effective when based on the IDPs'own analysis and warnings. Whendoing advocacy work, we as interna-tional organisations are all too oftenself-proclaimed advocates orspokespersons. We have an ethicalobligation to engage in dialogue andconsultation with those whom weclaim to represent.

What response strategies are employed by IDPs? What do we really mean by 'pro- tection'? What action should be taken to increase the level of IDP security? Angola has been at war since the start of the independence struggle againstthe Portuguese 40 years ago. Multipledisplacements have led to rural depopulation and the concentration ofpeople in provincial capitals, coastalareas and Luanda. The conflict hasacquired a nature and a level of inten-sity and violence never reachedbefore. Since mid-1998 both warringparties have deliberately used IDPs fortheir own military purposes. As aresult, the total number of IDPs inAngola has now reached 4 million.OCHA reports an increase of 384,000people in the first nine months of 2001. UNITA forces use brutal measures to prevent people leaving areas undertheir control. Entire groups are forcedto accompany UNITA soldiers on hit-and-run attacks. Systematic physicalabuse, mutilation of limbs and mur-der are the fate of those suspected ofbeing informers. For its part, the gov-ernment displaces people in order todeprive UNITA of food, labour, fight-ers and sex slaves. Families areintentionally separated, forcing menand male adolescents to remain andserve in the pro-government civilianmilitia. When new territory is cap-tured from UNITA, IDPs are preventedfrom leaving and are forced to remainwhile their living conditions progres- sively deteriorate. IDPs are oftentaken along during foraging expedi-tions and exposed to risk of UNITAambushes and landmines. Indiscrimin-ate beating, harassment and rape arefrequent. The near impossibility of securing access to the estimated half-millionIDPs in rebel-controlled areas imposesa serious obstacle for any protectionefforts. Here there is no officialhumanitarian assistance or presence,only some church workers facinggreat risks and intimidation whenthey try to help. Discussions aboutthe possibility of opening humanitari-an corridors have led nowhere.Reaching IDPs in areas recentlyreclaimed by the government is alsofraught with difficulty as humanitari-an workers are offered no security bythe authorities. Those IDPs who have managed to set- tle in camps enjoy a higher level ofprotection but still suffer abuses atthe hands of the security forces.Camps are often situated in insecureareas outside the security perimetersof urban areas, close to minefields oralongside roads and barracks subjectto UNITA attack. In official transitcentres or camps there is scope bothto deliver protection-oriented humani-tarian assistance and to develop Improving protection for IDPs: lessons from Angola by Andrea Lari We cannot hope to strengthen the response strategies of IDPs and their capacity to secure protection with-out first asking ourselves: 40 Improving protection for IDPs: lessons from Angola Working Group V: Protection protection projects. It is mainly in this setting that local responses and sub-sistence strategies can be identified,reinforced or improved. IDP response strategies During their multiple displacements,Angolans have learnt how to surviveand cope, how to flee and what tobring with them. Organised in smallgroups, they hide in the mata (bush), move by night and avoid main roads,minefields and routes used by UNITA.Food is carried for consumption andto exchange for agricultural and othertools needed to create a livelihood inthe area of new settlement. However, in the last few years these survival mechanisms have been break-ing down with increasing frequency.Many testimonies tell of people, andespecially children, dying in the bushbefore they are able to reach camps orsettle with friends and relatives inurban areas. The same happens ingovernment-controlled towns receiv-ing no external assistance. Lack offood and medicine plus chronic inse-curity soon take their toll. Those IDPs who do manage to reach the relative security of camps orrelatives have shown some importantskills that are shifting the nature ofthe strategy from survival to subsis-tence. During their first days in acamp it is common to see alreadysettled families providing moral andmaterial support and informing thenewly arrived how to access food.IDPs hosted by family members orfriends enjoy immediate support butwithin a few days have to start fend-ing for themselves. Host familiesrarely have enough resources to shareand the presence of new guests soonbecomes unbearable and gives rise toconflict. The subsistence activities ofIDPs have economic and social effectson the hosting community. While IDPsoften complain about the insufficientamount of food they receive fromhumanitarian agencies, their majorgrievances are to do with lack ofaccess to good quality land, tools andseeds. What is 'protection'? There should be general recognitionamong humanitarian actors of what ismeant by protection. It should com-prehend all activities oriented towardsthe full respect of the rights of the individual in accordance with the let-ter and the spirit of human rights andinternational humanitarian andrefugee laws. Some activities are oriented towards enhancing knowledge of human rightsstandards through education andtraining, Others, focusing on enforce-ment, include information gathering,monitoring, investigation, advocacy,public reporting of violations, pursu-ing cases through the national courtsor presenting complaints to interna-tional bodies when domestic remediesfail. The intent is to make the authori-ties account for their conduct and totake action when violations occur. Practical protection responses need to be delivered at field level. The UNGuiding Principles on InternalDisplacement represent an importantstarting point but they need to beincorporated into domestic law in theform of specific legislation whichactually operationalises its provisions,specifies the authorities responsiblefor protection and makes themaccountable. A functional justice sys-tem is essential if human rightsabuses suffered by IDPs are to beredressed. Angolan IDPs say that lack of physical security and freedom of movementare their major protection concerns.Abuses take place mainly outside the International Campaign to Ban Landmines/Mercedes Sayagues Kuito, Angola.camps, in isolated areas, close to army barracks or civilian militia checkpoints and when night is falling.Collecting firewood, gathering fruitand agricultural labour all requiremovement over long distances andoften in remote areas. Informal taxa-tion and physical harassment takeplace at checkpoints. Indiscriminatebeatings are common if IDPs fail topresent personal documentation orare unable to pay bribes. Women facephysical assaults and rape on theirway to or from the fields. There isgreat fear of being relocated to newcamps in sites where people are putat greater risk of UNITA attack. In theQuessua camp in Malanje provinceIDPs were happier to remain in theircamp bordering a minefield than bemoved. Increasing IDP security We should start to find ways toimprove the protection of IDPs byreducing the opportunities for theperpetrators to commit violations. Reinforcing existing mechanisms would be the first step. IDPs havedeveloped a great ability to organisetheir own protection strategies but are vulnerable as families are separat-ed and social structures distorted as aconsequence of displacement. Incamps some self-support networksare still working if the camp popula-tion is from the same area of origin ordue to the homogeneity of the groupsof people living there. After identify-ing the networks and representativeleaders of the camp, communityactions should be taken to strengthentheir capacity to respond to comm-unity needs. This allows IDPs themselves to take practical measures. As an example, inthe Sangondo camp in Moxicoprovince, a complaint was made tothe local army commander after acommunity leader was beaten by anarmy sergeant. As a result the perpe-trator was removed from the area andno new cases of abuse have sincebeen registered in the camp. Such an approach is more difficult in the case of IDPs living outside formalcamps where the task is to identifychurch and civic organisations whichare established and functioning withinthe resident community. Sounding outthe resident community remains an important resource to explorebecause of the multiple dynamics thatlink it to the displaced people. Agencies must ensure that they do not weaken local capacity by under-mining local resilience. There havebeen cases where aid has furtheredthe agenda of external actors butjeopardised the security of IDPs. Thiswas the case in a camp in Moxicowhich adjoins a minefield. Two agen-cies continued to supply food andnon-food items to the IDPs, thusweakening the effort made by otherorganisations to force the localauthorities to move the people to asafer location. Another example wasthe policy to supply food assistanceonly to those IDPs settled outside theprovincial capital of Malanje. Thoughdesigned to prevent overcrowding ofthe city centre and the risk of disease,the effect was to force IDPs to live inunsafe areas, vulnerable to UNITAattacks or reprisals. Even if there is room to improve the protection of IDPs through reinforcingtheir own response strategies, thesestrategies need to be complementedwith greater intervention by externalactors. When planning and imple-menting assistance operations,humanitarian organisations shouldensure that they include protectionstrategies. Action must be taken onbehalf of the victims and practicalprotection responses developed.Efforts should be made to involvelocal and national NGOs. Close moni-toring and advocacy at local level areessential. Programmes should bedesigned on the basis of good knowl-edge and detailed local analysis.Planning and implementation must becollaborative and informal andinclude IDPs as much as possible atall stages. Above all else, we should focus on getting national government struc-tures to fulfil their duties underinternational law to protect their owncitizens.

The group agreed on nine recom- mendations: We must look more closely at the link between protection strategiesand empowerment. What caninternational actors do to empow-er IDPs and enable them toprotect themselves? Greater protection must be offered to IDP leaders. Is this atask within the mandate of theUN rapporteur on human rights?If not, it should be. When preparing protection strate- gies in the field we need to domore to collect better information about the situation of IDPs livingin areas under the control of non-state actors. Continued dissemination of the Guiding Principles and theirinclusion in all protectionstrategies. Greater linking of humanitarian assistance and protection work.Humanitarian assistance organisa-tions, offering the carrot ofmaterial assistance, have an opportunity to more assertivelyput across the need forimproved protection of IDPs. Greater attention must be paid to identifying differences within IDPpopulations when protectionstrategies are developed. Theneeds of adults, children, men,women, the young and the elderlyare not the same. Investigate the possibility of inte- grating protection into the SphereProject in order to increase the quality of NGO protection work,improve lesson sharing andincrease accountability. Establish field-level protection working groups with a wide rangeof representatives from the localpopulation and internationalorganisations (but not the localauthorities) in order to jointly col-lect and analyse human rightsinformation and develop strate-gies to respond to human rightsabuses. International NGOs needto adequately fund such workinggroups and ensure that membershave commitment, adequateexpertise and training. International organisations need to build broader alliances withlocal organisations especially insituations where there is only onemajor international NGO with ahighly visible presence. Additional issues raised Working Group V: Protection Sphere Project (www.sphereproject.org)Sharing the Sphere Minimum Standards in Sri Lanka.Working group V: Protection Additional issues raised43 Final plenary session Final plenary discussion and recommendations1 1. Definition and responsibility At the time when the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacementwere developed, there were many defi-nitional debates. Some wanted to limitthe definition of IDPs to include thosewho, if they had crossed a border,would be refugees. Refugee organisa-tions argued that IDPs are necessarilythose suffering persecution.Eventually a broader definition wasdeveloped, including displacementboth by man-made events and naturaldisasters. The argument for this wasthat IDP is a description of a situationwhich cannot be limited. You cannottell people that they are not displacedif they are. Despite this broad definition, it is not always easy to say who is or who isnot an IDP. If people are re-settledthat might be a reason for saying thatthey are no longer internally dis-placed. But what about people whomay have integrated somewhere elsebut who, nevertheless, want to returnhome? How long are these people tobe considered internally displaced?Cyprus presents such a dilemma. Arethose Greek Cypriots who, 25 yearsago, integrated into new communitiesbut who still want to return home totheir original land to be classified asIDPs? And what about those peoplewho do return only to find theirhomes occupied and/or that theycannot sustain themselves? Although the definition it a broad one, it does have limits. Coercionmust be involved. Internal displace-ment is forced displacement.Voluntary migration does not makepeople IDPs.The question of definition is some- thing that has concerned the GlobalIDP Project because, when trying tocount the internally displaced, it isnecessary to have a specific categoryand grounds for inclusion or exclu-sion. It has become increasinglydifficult for the Project to determinewho should be included. There is aneed for more clarity, not necessarilylimiting the definition but at leastmaking it clear about whom we areconcerned and who we are going tocount. Linked to the question of definition is the question of whether the interna-tional community should beconcerned with all categories of IDPsand who in the international commu-nity should shoulder responsibilitiesfor them. There are IDPs who wouldbe classified as refugees if they hadcrossed a border while others dis-placed by natural disasters would notbe regarded as refugees if theycrossed a border. In a further categoryare those displaced by developmentprojects. Though the international community becomes involved with would-berefugees and victims of natural disas-ters, it is not the same agencies whichdo so. Even more controversial, inview of the level of passion about theissue of sovereignty, is the questionof people displaced by developmentprojects. Some have argued that themandate of the Representative of theSecretary-General on IDPs shouldinclude those displaced by develop-ment projects. Further research anddiscussion are underway on thisissue. 22. Protection and accountability Protection must be central toresponse strategies. Not only a fewpeople or a few organisations shouldtake on protection work. There shouldbe a clear lead on developing protec-tion strategies for each country sothat all international and local actorsin a particular country affected byinternal displacement could benefitfrom lead agencies, such as UNHCR orUNHCHR (High Commissioner forHuman Rights), working on a strategyfor detecting protection needs andalso on developing training, discus-sion groups and broad alliances. The new IDP Unit could take a lead inthis. Nowadays many NGOs are searching to find a role in protection. Many stillsee it as additional to their core workof providing health care, educationand other community services. Theysimply do not have the time and thecapacity to deal with complex humanrights and political issues. However,the link between providing assistanceand protection is crucial. There ismuch that NGOs can and should do.For a start, any information that NGOsgather due to their presence in a par-ticular area should be automaticallypassed on to human rights organisa-tions. In the field, core groups of experi- enced and committed people need tobe set up to focus on protection.Broadly constituted protection work-ing groups need to bring together arange of representatives of the IDPpopulation and the host society inorder to gather and analyse informa-tion and jointly develop protectionstrategies. There is a concern about the need for improved coordination of the humani-tarian response. In each country, anoverall plan for assistance could bemade, with benchmarks, monitoringof implementation and a clear plan ofthe responsibilities of the differentagencies involved. In addition, thequestion of accountability - linked toresponsibility - needs to beaddressed. Many recommendationswere made, for example, by the mis-sions of the office of the UN SpecialAll working groups agreed that we need: more information and better understanding of the coping mechanisms and response strategies of the inter- nally displaced and how researchers and practitionerscan work with IDPs much closer partnerships between research, humanit- arian and IDP communities improved methodologies, particularly in setting standards and contextualising guidelines Discussion in the final plenary focused around four main areas:44 Final plenary session Coordinator on Internal Displacement, relating to each country visited; thechallenge now is to ensure effectiveimplementation of the recommenda-tions. The new IDP Unit will need tofind mechanisms for implementationof these recommendations by the UNand by NGOs. The UN system ofhumanitarian coordinators should bebetter used to strengthen coordina-tion and hence accountability. Linked to this is the need for donors to be committed to evaluating howfunds are spent. Colombia provides agood example in its follow-up matrixwhich indicated tasks and responsibil-ities and which the government wasactive in overseeing. 3. Working with local authorities The humanitarian community has to grapple with the dilemma of whetherto cooperate with authorities whohave themselves been responsible foratrocities against IDPs. In general, weneed to pursue complementary meth-ods and keep open dialogue with theauthorities. There are different methods of doing so. At meetings when individuals whohave suffered human rights violationsare relating their experiences, thoseinvolved need to consider and decidewhether or not the perpetratorsshould be allowed to be present.When we are gathering informationand views from community leaders onhow to develop protection strategies,government representatives and armypersonnel may well need to be exclud-ed so that people can talk freelywithout fear of reprisals. A furtherpossibility is to involve the govern-ment in a working group when, forexample, discussing the ramificationsof providing assistance in a district orprovince. The humanitarian communitycan prepare and organise protection fora group in cooperation with stateactors. We can specify what specificviolations must be avoided with theclear intention not to jeopardise thesecurity of those who have previouslysuffered from such violations. To address long-term objectives we need to consider working to createviable structures involving local gov-ernment, civic groups or religiousorganisations. By assisting and strengthening local structures andcapacities we are much more likely toprovide future protection from humanrights violations. 4. Research and information Many have pointed to the need tomake available all the research andother information that exists relatingto IDPs. The Global IDP Project has awidely used database with a wealth ofinformation on displacement aroundthe world 3. There is, nevertheless, a substantial amount of knowledge inthe research community, particularlywithin academic environments, whichshould be more widely shared. Whatis the point in gathering informationwhich does not reach key actors orfeed into policy making? Our chal-lenge is to spread information andmake it useful and valid for all con-cerned with IDP issues. Humanitarian workers try to be as well prepared as they can and receivea lot of information when they are outin the field. They are never sent outwith a set of preconceived answersbecause every displacement situationis unique and unpredictable. What isreally needed is a link betweenresearch and practice, a motivation toask and to seek answers to questions.What kind of information do we needto know? What warning signs can beanticipated? How do we know whenthings are going well or badly? Afterhumanitarian workers make anassessment, are they committed tosharing it with the research communi-ty? Could an email discussion groupfocused solely on IDP issues improveinformation exchange? In response to this information gap, NTNU and the Global IDP Databaseproject of the Norwegian RefugeeCouncil are planning to set up a newdatabase and contact networkbetween academics, practitioenrs andpolicy makers. For details, see p 46. Another issue is information sharing within and between humanitarianagencies and IDP communities on theground. The humanitarian communityknows far too little about how andhow fast information is exchangedamong displaced populations. Oftenpeople do not trust internationalorganisations when they give outinformation. Frequently IDPs perceive information given to them about con-ditions and prospects for return asbiased. They prefer to trust their ownways of obtaining information - a sys-tem that is more sophisticated thanwe tend to think. The humanitariancommunity needs to vastly improveits sharing of information about activ-ities with displaced populations andbeneficiaries. An existing vehicle for bridging the gap between researchers and practi-tioners is Forced Migration Review , published three times a year (inEnglish, Spanish and Arabic) by theRefugee Studies Centre in associationwith the Norwegian Refugee Council(www.fmreview.org). Researchers andpractitioners should be encouraged touse such vehicles. Sharing and contextualising of inter- national principles and standards withthe internally displaced should be akey objective of the international com-munity. The Guiding Principles havebeen translated into many languages(see page 46) but more translationsare needed. The international commu-nity needs to emulate a recentexample in Sri Lanka (see page 19)and work with local NGOs to contex-tualise them. Although the SphereMinimum Standards have been pub-lished in five languages (English,French, Spanish, Portuguese andRussian), more needs to be done toget them more widely translated andshared with internally displaced com-munities. 1 This is a summary of views expressed by a num- ber of participants but does not necessarily reflectthe views of all who attended the conference. 2 W Courtland Robinson of the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health is currentlypreparing a research paper for the Brookings-CUNY Project on the subject of development-induced displacement, in particular on the applica-bility of the Guiding Principles to development-induced displacement and the extent to whichthere should be international attention to suchcases and by whom. This includes identifying thekinds of cases the international community, in par-ticular the Representative of the UNSecretary-General on Internally Displaced Persons,might be expected to focus upon. The Brookings-CUNY Project has been collaborating with expertsfrom the World Bank, among others, on this; ameeting on the subject will be held once a finaldraft is ready for review. 3 See www.idpproject.org45 Final plenary session Final remarks here have been IDP confer- ences, symposia, seminars,round tables, square tables, all sorts of tables. I am not sure to whatextent all these conferences havebrought the issue of IDPs forward orupwards. Still, it has been andremains important that we all contin-ue to participate in efforts to keep theIDP issue on the agenda. What do we do after this conference? How do we keep the momentumgoing? While I do not have any finalanswers, I can give you an indicationof three concrete actions that we inthe Norwegian Ministry of ForeignAffairs plan to take. First of all, we want to engage and involve Norwegian NGOs in discus-sions related to internally displacedpersons. When we discuss projects orfinancing of projects initiated by theNorwegian Refugee Council, NorwegianPeople's Aid, the Norwegian Caritas, the Norwegian Red Cross or others,we will, when it is appropriate andrelevant to do so, ask them: \"Is therean element or component that youshould address which has somethingto do with IDPs? If so, bring it out!\" Secondly, we will put the IDP issue high on the political agenda in ourhumanitarian work as a member ofthe UN Security Council. The Security Council as such may not be the mostrelevant forum for raising humanitari-an issues but we believe that theyshould be a part of the agenda of theSecurity Council. When appropriateand relevant we shall bring the IDPissue into discussions in the SecurityCouncil. I have today chaired a meeting in my ministry, with the participation of thefive big Norwegian humanitarianNGOs, to initiate a process by whichwe can involve NGOs in our dailywork in the Security Council. In orderto keep IDPs high on the agenda ofthe Security Council we will bring theexperience, knowledge and compe-tence of Norwegian NGOs to theirattention. IDPs will be high on ourinternal agenda when we assume thepresidency of the Security Council.I cannot say here and now that we cancommit ourselves to selecting the IDPissue as our theme but the fact that itis under discussion speaks for itself. Thirdly, and lastly, we certainly wel- come the establishment of KofiAsomani's IDP Unit in OCHA. Webelieve that this indicates that theinternational community is takingseriously the institutional issues related to the IDP issue. Mr Asomani, while we welcome your entity, we will not just confine our-selves to writing cheques, for we areyour owners, we own the UN system,the specialised agencies and all thepeople working there. More than any-thing else, we want to support you onthe political side. As we talked aboutin one of the coffee breaks, we shalldefinitely keep channels open. We willbe here; we know that you are there.We are looking forward immensely tostarting cooperation with you in orderto maintain momentum and to movethe agenda forward so that we canalleviate the problems and the disas-ters facing our internally displacedfellow human beings.

Email: fredrik.arthur@mfa.no Final remarks by Fredrik Arthur Deputy Director-General, Section for Humanitarian Assistance, Royal Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Norway. I should like to share with you a few impressions from a number of IDP conferences that I haveattended over the last four or five years. T46 Resources A new database on IDP research and academic publications will belaunched by the end of 2002 as anintegrated and complementary com-ponent of the Norwegian RefugeeCouncil's Global IDP database(www.idpproject.org). The new web-site will provide a forum fordeveloping better links between acad-emics, practitioners and policymakers concerned with IDP issues. The database will include overview and short description of ongoing and completed researchprojects related to internal dis-placement, including the names ofresearchers, institutions, researchtopics and location of fieldwork bibliographies updated monthlyidentification and formulation of current research needs, issuesand methodologies notice-board for conferences on internal displacement discussion group(s) and message service exchange of inputs on ideas for future research The database is to be jointly coordi- nated by the Research Group onForced Migration at the of Technology and Science(www.svt.ntnu.no/geo/Forskning/Researchgroup/forcedmig.htm) and theGlobal IDP Project/Norwegian RefugeeCouncil, Geneva. It is hoped that the network will pro- vide a valuable information resourcefor researchers and actors outside the academic community in governments,NGOs and the UN system. Improvedaccess to academic informationshould encourage researchers toaddress the research gaps in currentunderstanding of displacement.

Drawing on case studies and testimonies from dis-placed people from across the globe, it vividly illustrates themethods and networks used by IDPs. The authors identify cross-cultural patterns of coping strategies and examine theireffectiveness. A series of recommendations urges the internation-al community to listen to and work with IDPs and ensure thatrelief and protection activities build on and reinforce existing coping mechanisms.
