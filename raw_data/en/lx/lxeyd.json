Arginine is known to improve blood flow to the genitals and has been shown to be effective in treating ED. 2. Oysters Oysters are a well-known aphrodisiac and are rich in zinc, which is essential for the production of testosterone. Testosterone is important for sexual function and arousal. 3.

It is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and has been shown to improve sexual function in women with menopause. It is proven to boost the production of nitric oxide, a compound that aids blood flow and helps muscle tissues relax. This may help alleviate the symptoms and ED and enhance sexual arousal in men. 5. Saffron Saffron is a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus, commonly known as the \"saffron crocus\". Crocin is the main active ingredient in saffron and is responsible for its yellow-orange color. It has long been used in traditional medicine as an aphrodisiac. Modern science has confirmed its libido boosting effect by showing that it increases levels of testosterone and prolactin, two hormones essential for sexual arousal ( [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29881706/)). It's also effective at lowering stress levels, which may have the effect of increasing sexual desire and satisfaction. 6. Maca Maca is a root vegetable that grows in the Andes mountains of central Peru. It has been used by indigenous people for centuries to enhance stamina and energy levels ( [4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12472620/)). Maca is rich in several nutrients including iron, magnesium, and zinc. It also contains a high concentration of glucosinolates, which are thought to boost libido. In one study, men who took maca supplements for 12 weeks reported increased libido, improved sexual function, and increased ejaculation volume. Another study showed that maca may improve sexual desire in postmenopausal women. When it comes to weight loss, progress is made by inches, not miles, so it's much harder to track and a lot easier to give up.

One study found that taking 600 mg of fenugreek extract daily for eight weeks improved sexual function in men with diabetes.

Ginkgo biloba is thought to act as a natural Viagra for men because it improves blood circulation. It is also believed to improve sexual function in men by increasing libido and treating erectile dysfunction ( [7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27661038/)).
