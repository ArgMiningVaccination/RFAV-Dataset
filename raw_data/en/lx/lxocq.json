In a recent publication, we estimated a relative vaccine effectiveness (rVE) of HD-IIV3 vs. aIIV3 of 12% (95% CI: 3.3-20%) for influenza-related hospitalizations using a retrospective study design, but did not report the number of prevented hospitalizations nor the associated avoided cost. In this paper we report estimations for both. Methods: Leveraging the rVE of a cohort study over two influenza seasons (2016/17 and 2017/18), we collected cost data for healthcare provided to the same study population. Vaccine costs were obtained from the Medicare pricing schedule. Our economic assessment compared cost of vaccination and hospital care for patients experiencing acute respiratory or cardiovascular illness. Results: We analyzed 1.9 million HD-IIV3 and 223,793 aIIV3 recipients. Average vaccine list prices were $46.23 for HD-IIV3 and $48.26 for aIIV3. The hospitalization rates for respiratory disease in HD-IIV3 and aIIV3 recipients were 187 (95% CI: 185-189) and 212 (195-231) per 10,000 persons-years, respectively. Attributing the average cost per hospitalization of $12,652 ($12,214-$13,090) to the difference in hospitalization rates, we estimate net savings of HD-IIV3 to be $34 ($10-$62) per recipient. Conclusion: Pooled over two predominantly A/H3N2 respiratory seasons, vaccination with HD-IIV3 was associated with lower hospitalization rates and associated costs compared to aIIV3 in senior members of a large national managed health care company in the U.S. Reduced hospitalizations affect healthcare utilization overall, and therefore other costly health outcomes.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-09-24", "cleaned_text": "Economic Assessment of High-Dose Versus Adjuvanted Influenza Vaccine: An Evaluation of Hospitalization Costs Based on a Cohort Study [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9101065](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9101065) [Health In the U.S., the annual cost of hospitalizations associated with influenza are estimated to be $1.3 billion for this age group [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-01065)]. Given this substantial cost, a health economic analysis of the various influenza vaccination strategies aiming to increase protection for this age group is pertinent. [3](#B3-vaccines-09-01065)]. In this paper we present estimations for both. The cohort study used a statistical rate-change method (PERR) to adjust for observable and unobservable differences between the HD-IIV3 and aIIV3 recipients. The use of this method will improve the accuracy of the economic burden estimations as well [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-01065)]. 2. Methods 2.1. Study Design, Population and Data Sources [Supplemental Table S1](#app1-vaccines-09-01065)), The primary outcome was an acute hospitalization for respiratory disease, defined by its principal discharge diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, [ICD-10]: Jxx). In addition, we reported hospitalizations for either cardiovascular or respiratory disease (ICD-10: Ixx-Jxx). Outcome rates were adjusted for the person-level confounding factors gender, race, age, Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) region (proxy for place of residency), month of vaccination, proxies for frailty, comorbid conditions, and influenza vaccination history ( [Supplemental Table S2](#app1-vaccines-09-01065)). In addition, outcome rates were adjusted for time-fixed unmeasured confounding factors by comparing the outcome rate change from pre-vaccination to post-vaccination period in the HD-IIV3 cohort with the rate change in the S1](#app1-vaccines-09-01065)). We then calculated the absolute risk reduction (ARR) by subtracting the incidence rate in the HD-IIV3 cohort from the rate in the aIIV3 cohort. The multiplicative inverse of ARR results in the number needed to vaccinate (NNV = 1/ARR): the number of patients that need to be vaccinated with HD-IIV3 instead of aIIV3 to prevent one additional hospitalization ( [Table 1](#vaccines-09-01065-t001)). To evaluate cost savings of HD-IIV3 vaccination, we estimated the difference in costs per aIIV3 recipient as if they had received HD-IIV3 instead. This was calculated as the average cost of all observed hospitalizations for aIIV3 recipients divided by the NNV minus the average cost difference of administering the two vaccines. Average hospitalization costs were calculated using the standardized costs of each of the observed hospitalizations in either cohort ( [Supplemental Table S4](#app1-vaccines-09-01065)). We calculated the total realized net cost savings by multiplying the total number of HD-IIV3 recipients by the cost savings per HD-IIV3 recipient. [11](#B11-vaccines-09-01065)]. For hospitalization cost, we obtained the standard costs from CDM for all observed hospitalizations at the patient level. The standard cost aims to remove variability in medical costs due to various reasons, including geographical location and payer negotiated contracts ( [Supplemental Table S4](#app1-vaccines-09-01065)). CDM is statistically de-identified under the Expert Determination method consistent with HIPAA [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-01065)]. 2.2. Sensitivity Analysis [9](#B9-vaccines-09-01065)]. This assumption formalizes the intuitive requirement that the rate-change in the aIIV3 group can be used as a proxy for the rate-change in the HD-IIV3 group, had they received aIIV3 instead. Because potential violations of this assumption cannot be observed in the data (untestable), we applied a sensitivity analysis that adjusts PERR with a bias parameter ranging from 0.9 to 1.1 ( [Supplemental Analysis S2](#app1-vaccines-09-01065)) [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-01065)]. In addition, we added a sensitivity analysis replacing the list price of the vaccines with a scenario where HD-IIV3 is $10 more or less expensive than aIIV3, reflecting potential differences in market price. 3. Results [Table 1](#vaccines-09-01065-t001), [Supplemental Table S3](#app1-vaccines-09-01065)). Attributing the average cost per hospitalization of $12,652 ($12,214-$13,090) to the difference in hospitalization rates, we estimate net cost savings of $34 ($10-$62) per HD-IIV3 recipient ( When varying the PERR bias parameter, we observe lower sensitivity in hospitalizations for respiratory disease only than in hospitalizations for either cardiovascular or respiratory disease ( [Table 4](#vaccines-09-01065-t004)). Where the point estimate for net cost savings due to reduced hospitalizations for respiratory disease remains positive ($7 per HD-IIV3 recipient), the point estimate for hospitalizations for respiratory or cardiovascular disease becomes negative ($27 per HD-IIV3 recipient). 4. Discussion [13](#B13-vaccines-09-01065), [14](#B14-vaccines-09-01065)] As a result, the total cost savings may be higher than we estimate here. [3](#B3-vaccines-09-01065)]. In these first seasons, vaccination rates for the adjuvanted vaccine were much lower than for HD-IIV3 ( [Supplemental Table S3](#app1-vaccines-09-01065)). It is not unreasonable to expect selection bias introduced by early adopters of aIIV3. We observed, for instance, a much higher proportion of seniors who received their aIIV3 vaccine in a community pharmacy (versus doctor's office) compared to HD-IIV3 recipients, meaning that healthier people who have less frequent doctor's visits were more likely to receive the adjuvanted vaccine ( [Supplemental Table S2](#app1-vaccines-09-01065)). In the case study, the PERR method was applied because the authors found conventional methods (regression or conditioning on place of vaccination and all other person-level baseline characteristics) resulted in differences between the cohorts of adjusted hospitalization rates in the pre-vaccination or summer period (where similar rates were expected\u2014a sign of residual bias caused by unmeasured confounding factors). The case study, like any retrospective study using insurance claims data, was limited in the quality of person-level data it could extract. Good proxies for confounding factors like frailty, access to care, and healthcare seeking behavior were not available. If we assume these unmeasured factors are not likely to change during the relatively short time span from pre- to post-vaccination period (i.e., they are time-fixed), the PERR method can adjust for them. [9](#B9-vaccines-09-01065)]. This assumption formalizes the intuitive requirement that the rate-change in the aIIV3 group can be used as a proxy for the rate-change in the HD-IIV3 group, had they received aIIV3 instead. In a sensitivity analysis, we tested the effect violations of this assumption has on the net cost-savings. Indeed, we observed high sensitivity to this assumption. Unfortunately, the true value of the bias parameter u is not observable in the data. However, it is helpful to remember from the case study that pre-treatment hospitalization rates during the summer period were 20% higher in the HD group compared with the aIIV3 group, suggesting that HD recipients were sicker or frailer than aIIV3 recipients. Going into the post-treatment period, the winter, it is not unlikely that the health status of HD recipients decreases more than the health status of aIIV3 recipients (resulting in u < 1). Continuing this line of thought, the estimated rVE of 12% might be an underestimation of the true rVE ( [Supplemental Analysis S2](#app1-vaccines-09-01065)), and net cost savings presented in [Table 4](#vaccines-09-01065-t004)under u = 1.1 would be a better estimate of the true savings [ [15](#B15-vaccines-09-01065)]. [16](#B16-vaccines-09-01065)]. Using a more influenza-specific outcome\u2014typically resulting in a higher rVE\u2014Izurieta's finding suggests that our PERR-adjusted rVE might be an overestimation. It is important to keep in mind, however, that Izurieta and colleagues used a propensity score method to adjust for confounding. This method cannot adjust for selection bias introduced by time-fixed unmeasured confounders. Although the authors included proxies for frailty in their model, residual confounding caused by these other unmeasured or incorrectly classified confounding factors cannot be ruled out. Given our observation that HD-IIV3 tends to be given to frailer patients than aIIV3, residual confounding would bias HD-IIV3 rVE to the null. Continuing this line of thought, the estimated rVE of 7.7% might be an underestimation of the true rVE. [Supplemental Table S3](#app1-vaccines-09-01065)). Last, small measurement errors in the ascertainment of baseline characteristics (misclassification) might explain why the stratified place of vaccination does not exactly add up to 100% ( [Supplemental Table S2](#app1-vaccines-09-01065)) [3](#B3-vaccines-09-01065)]. Reassuringly, we did not observe a treatment effect against UTI in the pooled analysis ( [Supplemental Table S3](#app1-vaccines-09-01065)). This allows us to assume that the PERR model was not misspecified. Our sensitivity analysis of the PERR method provides reasonable arguments why the reported cost-savings are likely to be conservative. We extracted the standard cost for each observed hospitalization which better reflects the true cost of the procedures ( [Supplemental Table S4](#app1-vaccines-09-01065)). To the best of our knowledge, there are no economic differences in a person hospitalized for a respiratory disease based on the vaccine received. [17](#B17-vaccines-09-01065)], the only other direct comparison of hospitalization cost we could find between HD-IIV3 and aIIV3 during a similar time period and geographic area. Important differences between the two studies may explain, in part, the different study results. First and most importantly, the outcome definitions differ in sensitivity and specificity. Second, the studies were done in different populations. Where our study was limited to a commercially insured population, the Pelton study included publicly insured subjects through Medicare. Lastly, statistical approaches between both studies differed. Notably, the Pelton study controlled for measured confounding factors using inverse probability of treatment weighting and generalized estimating equations, whereas we relied on the prior event rate ratio method that controls for both measured and unmeasured confounding factors. 5.
