As doctors gain more knowledge about medicine the death rate of those disease has substantially decreased. The three main illnesses of the 1800's-1900's were scarlet fever, tuberculosis, and chicken pox, yet a positive outcome from these horrendous sicknesses were antibiotics, remedies, and vaccines. Through the learning from week 1 and week 2, I have learnt that the most frequent adverse event in health-care delivery is health care-associated infections. It is essential for us to follow the infection control practices that both patients and us are at a risk of being infected. Standard Precautions involve the use of safe work practices and protective barriers, for example, the use of personal protective equipment(PPE). At first, I think Standard Precautions are very easy. Everyone knows PPE can protect us from infections and hand hygiene is important throughout the process. However, what I ignored and did wrong were the correct sequences of wearing PPE and how to use them correctly. The sequences are totally different when taking on and So, what is the definition of health care associated infections? They are infections that patients acquire while being hospitalized to receive treatment for their conditions either medical or surgical. Many of the HCAIs are preventable. In the modern healthcare, there are many types of invasive procedures that is used to treat patients to help them recover, also some devices are used, and all can be a potential risk for transmitting an infection to the patient while receiving the treatment. Disposal and handling of hazardous materials such as nappies and body fluids is an important part in the Staphylococcus epidermidis is the organism that was identified based on the tests that I had conducted. The tests that I used to identify this organism were the coagulase test and the catalase test. My bacterium was beta hemolytic as well. First, a gram stain had to be done to determine whether the organism was a gram positive organism or a gram negative organism. This determined which set of tests that had to be done. My bacterium turned out to be gram positive. When conducting these tests, I only had to do the coagulase test and the catalase test because when doing the catalase test, the reaction was that it had bubbled. If it did not bubble, or have a positive reaction, then I would not have had to do the coagulase test. Also, since my bacterium caused a positive catalase test, I only had to do the coagulase test and no other tests. This is because with staphylococcus organisms, these are the only tests Safety provi\u00acsions are interpreted to protect patients from illnesses caused in the course of medical treatment as well as to provide hygienic and injury-free experience in the health care setting. Special provisions exist for safety in pharmaceuticals, blood supply, infectious disease treatment and diagnostics, and mental health services, among others. Ethical codes for doctors, nurses, and other health care workers contain provisions applicable to the patients' right to safety. Medical errors and other actions that fail to meet safety standards can carry civil, criminal and administrative penalties I would use protective equipment such as gloves, aprons and masks during any type of personal care or handling waste or bodily fluids, for instance, I would wear gloves when requiring a patient to take a UDS (Urine Drug Screen). The preventive care is usually diverse especially when it comes to controlling the roundworms in places which are not good with hygiene. Most of the nurses usually advise the patients to stay in clean environments in order to prevent them from contamination (prevention, 2016). This is because the preventive measure which is taken are considered to be better than the cure methods. In the prevention of roundworms, the nurses play a very big role in ensuring that the conditions are mitigated completely. Being a Phlebotomist in a nursing home, I go to each patient's bedside. My toolbox comes with me to each room. Inside my vampire toolbox contains a Biohazards container, a box of gloves, rolls of medical tape, gauze, alcohol prep pads, tourniquets, 22g straight needles and butterfly needles. For each patient, I put on a new clean pair of gloves, put a piece of tape below my thumb, grab a piece of gauze, alcohol prep pad and tourniquet. I keep all these materials close to me so that everything can be done in an orderly and timely Ignaz Semmelweis is known as the pioneer of antiseptic procedures being the first to introduce the role of hand hygiene in preventing person to person cross contamination. Semmelweis reduced mortality in the maternity ward to about 1% in 1861. Hospital acquired infections occur in 10% of US hospital patients and not only weighs on the mortality rate but also causes extra expenditure that can be quite substantial. While some nosocomial infections are harder to avoid, 10%-15% of these infections is said to be avoidable through proper hand hygiene. The question is no longer whether or not hand hygiene affects the rate of nosocomial infections but whether or not health care workers adequately adhere to hand hygiene practices, and if not, what has to be done to insure that they do. A presentation was provided for a small group of residents and nursing students for a facility known as Casas Adobes Post-Acute Rehabilitation in Tucson, AZ. An introduction of self and why this writer was there were completed. A rubber chicken and some apples which were covered with a powder called Glo Germ were passed around the room. When this powder is rubbed in well on an object, it cannot be seen by the naked eye. It was asked of the participants to feel the objects and at the end of the presentation things will be explained why they were passed these items. Clinical governance ensures that organisations become accountable for continuously improving their services and safe-guarding standard of care 'by creating an environment in which excellence in clinical care will flourish' (Scally and Donaldson 1998). Clinical audit emerged from within the clinical governance framework and is now seen as one of the most important elements of clinical governance (NICE 2002); it has been defined as 'a quality improvement process that seeks to improve patient care and outcomes through systematic review against explicit criteria and the implementation of change'. The student intends to focus this audit on staff knowledge in relation to Hand Hygiene and Infection Control and to evaluate the hand hygiene education Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) is one of the most important agents in the prevention of hospital acquired infections or what we termed nosocomial infections. IPC channels every member of the hospital, which includes, healthcare providers (HCP), patients and the hospitals perse. It is important to practice IPC commandment to every hospital as well as community. The Palestinian Ministry of Health (MOH) adopted the national IPC protocol. Employees working in pediatrics hospital are supposed to take precautions to protect their patients and staff from exposure to potentially infectious materials. A fundamental component of standard infection prevention measures are a system of barrier precautions to be used by all personnel It is necessary to eliminate the possibility of contamination of the starting materials and/or products of other materials and products. Increased risk of accidental cross-contamination contributes to the uncontrolled spread of dust, gases, vapours, aerosols or micro-organisms present in the materials and products, equipment, and clothing (Coyle, et.al, 2004, 179-186). The degree of risk depends on the type of contamination and product exposed to contamination. The most dangerous pollutants are sensitizing substances, biological preparations containing living organisms, certain hormones, cytotoxics and potent substances (Pye & Blott, 2009, 170-181). Contamination is particularly dangerous for drugs used for injection or for the treatment of open wounds and also intended for prolonged use and/or receiving high doses. To prevent cross contamination, taking into account the conditions of production the following activities should be carried out: In all areas of healthcare, particularly in acute care settings, patients may be unable to care for their nutritional and/or hygienic needs properly. One area that is especially important to address is the perineal care of patients who are incapacitated, or otherwise unable to care for their hygienic needs independently. Normal bacterial flora can develop into an opportunistic infection if the bacteria reaches certain areas of the body. For example, a common cause of urinary tract infections (UTI) is due to Escherichia coli from the colon coming into contact with the urethra (Copstead & Banasik, 2013). If the patient is immunocompromised, elderly, sedentary, or otherwise compromised in their abilities to void, this can predispose the patient "}
