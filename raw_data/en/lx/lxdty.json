Please note, the terms of a customer's particular benefit plan document [Group Service Agreement, Evidence of Coverage, Certificate of Coverage, Summary Plan Description (SPD) or similar plan docu ment] may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Coverage Policies are based. For example, a customer's benefit plan document may contain a specific exclusion related to a topic addressed in a Coverage Policy. In the event of a conflict, a customer's benefit plan document always supersedes the information in the Coverage Policies. In the absence of a controlling federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately determined by the terms of the applicable benefit plan do cument. Coverage determinations in each specific instance require consideration of 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date of service; 2) any applicable laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials includ ing Coverage Policies and; 4) the specific facts of the particular situation. Each coverage request should be reviewed on its own merits. Medical directors are expected to exercise clinical judgment where appropriate and have discretion in making individua l coverage determinations. Where coverage for care or services does not depend on specific circumstances, reimbursement will only be provided if a requested service(s) is submitted in accordance with the relevant criteria outlined in the applicable Coverag e Policy, including covered diagnosis and/or procedure code(s). Reimbursement is not allowed for services when billed for conditions or diagnoses that are not covered under this Coverage Policy (see \"Coding Information\" below). When billing, providers must use the most appropriate codes as of the effective date of the submission. Claims submitted for services that are not accompanied by covered code(s) under the applicable Coverage Policy will be denied as not covered. Coverage Policies relate exclusively t o the administration of health benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used as treatment guidelines. Overview This Coverage Policy addresses intensive behavioral interventions (e.g., adaptive behavior treatment, applied behavior analysis) for treatment of autism spectrum disorders. EVERNORTH Coverage Policy: EN 0499 2 Coverage Policy Some states mandate coverage of intensive behavioral interventions and/or treatment of autism spectrum disorders (ASD ) for benefit plans regulated under state law. For example, New York law requires regulated benefit plans to provide coverage for the screening, diagnosis and treatment of ASD, including applied behavioral analysis. Please refer to the applicable benefit plan document to determine terms, conditions and limitations of coverage. Medically Necessary Criteria for Assessment to receive Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) services An assessment for ABA is considered medically necessary when ALL of the following criteria are met: Diagnosis The individual has a confirmed diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD); (ICD -10-CM Diagnosis Codes F84.0 - F84.9, with the exception of F84.2, Rett syndrome) based on the criteria in the Diagnostic and S tatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM -5-TR) by a healthcare professional who is licensed to practice independently and whose licensure board considers diagnostics to be within their scope of practice and BOTH of the follo wing must be provided: The name, credentials, and type of licensure of the individual who made the diagnosis The date on which the diagnosis was made Assessment The assessment will be performed by a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA), Licensed Behavior Analyst (LBA), or a mental health clinician who is licensed to practice independently and who has documented training in ABA.

Treatment goals are directly related to the symptoms of ASD and their effects as defined by the DSM -5-TR. Baseline data have been obtained and provided, with dates recorded, for all behaviors and skil ls identified for intervention across all settings/environments in which treatment will occur. EVERNORTH Coverage Policy: EN 0499 4 When service initiation has occurred greater than 60 days prior to the date of the submission of the authorization request, baseline, interim and current data h ave been obtained and provided, with dates on which data were collected, for all of the behaviors and skills identified for intervention across all settings/environments in which treatment will occur/has occurred. Each goal includes clearly defined mastery criteria indicating the standards for determining whether a goal/objective has been/will be met that are consistent with the units of measurement identified within the goal as well as the data collection method utilized to report baseline, interim and cur rent data. If group treatment is planned, the treatment plan/plan of care must include clearly defined, measurable goals for the group therapy that are specific to the individual and their targeted behaviors and skills and have been identified for interve ntion based on the details and results gathered through the full and comprehensive ABA Assessment (as noted in the sections above). There is a clear plan to ensure maintenance and generalization of acquired skills across all settings/environments where treatment will occur. There is a clearly defined, measurable, individualized, and realistic transition plan that includes a plan for fading services across all settings/environments where treatment will occur. There are individu alized discharge criteria that are clearly defined, measurable, realistic, and are directly related to the symptoms of ASD and their effects as defined by the DSM -5-TR. The planned intensity of treatment reflects the severity of the impairments, goals of treatment, and response to treatment across all settings/environments where treatment will occur. There is a clear and documented plan to coordinate care with all other medical and mental health providers, and with government mandated/school services. Case supervision will be performed by a BCBA, LBA or a mental health professional who is licensed to practice independently and who has documented training in ABA and includes ALL of the following: Direct case supervision (occurs concurrently with the de livery of direct treatment to the client and consists of BCBA face -to-face with the individual and either the Registered Behavior Technician [RBT] or the Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst [BCaBA]) and indirect case supervision is consistent with t he general accepted standard of care of one to two hours per ten hours of direct treatment. Direct case supervision time accounts for 50% or more of case supervision. When direct treatment is 10 hours per week or less, a minimum of two hours per week of case supervision is provided. Supervisory services requested/provided coincide with Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code descriptions as identified by the American Medical Association (AMA). The name and credentials of the individual who will prov ide supervision must be documented. + Stakeholder (e.g., parent/caregiver, relative, teacher, and/or other impacted/invested party) training will be conducted by a BCBA, LBA, or a mental health professional who is licensed to practice independently and who has documented training in ABA and includes ALL of the following: There are clearly defined, measurable stakeholder goals that are individualized to the stakeholder(s) and the individual client's needs designed to teach all relevant stakeholder(s) the basic behavioral principles of ABA and how to continue behavioral inte rventions in the home and community, as well as across all relevant settings/environments. If group stakeholder training is planned, there are clearly defined, measurable stakeholder training goals for the group training that are individualized to the sta keholder(s) and the individual's needs. Baseline data have been obtained and provided, with dates recorded, for all stakeholder behaviors and skills identified for intervention across all settings/environments in which treatment will occur.

The therapist must remain in line of sight, direct engagement, and within close enough proximity to the individual to allow for consistent presentation of learning opportunities that re late to the goals and objectives identified within the plan of care/treatment plan (this does not apply to telehealth services, when applicable). For services that are focused primarily on addressing, preventing or responding to maladaptive behavior(s), the identified behavior(s) must be occurring at a frequency and/or severity (as documented through data collection methods noted above) that requires active intervention throughout the time the therapist is with the individual. ABA services are not utiliz ed to replace or replicate activities that are the responsibility of the setting/environment where services occur (e.g., classroom aide, 1:1 teacher, tutor, vocational assistant/coach, respite services, etc.). Other Factors + ABA services delivered by mu ltiple ABA providers during the same authorization period are not considered medically necessary unless ALL of the following are present and documented: Providers are addressing substantially different skills. There is a clear plan to coordinate care acr oss providers, to ensure the services are not duplicative, and are consistent with clinical needs of the individual based on documentation and data collection. Behavioral intervention strategies used across providers are consistent and not contradictory. + When the goals of treatment include feeding conditions and toileting concerns, BOTH of the following must be met: The treatment plan/plan of care includes specific safety measures and protocols. Consultation with medical and/or dietary/nutritional professionals has occurred prior to the initiation of the intervention, will be continued on an ongoing basis, and is specifically documented. + When the goals of treatment are implemented as part of Severe Behavior Programs and/or inclu de severe behavior, ALL of the criteria from initiation of treatment section (and continued treatment section as applicable) are currently met, as well as ALL of the following must be met: A complete treatment history is obtained and documented including relevant co -morbid conditions, current medications, previous treatment/intervention (including participation in higher levels of care as applicable), and any currently implemented treatment/intervention. A complete history of the targeted severe behavior(s ) is obtained and documented (e.g., involvement of emergency services, bodily injury, collateral damage, property destruction, distance/duration of elopement, etc.). Response to previous and/or current treatment is documented indicating necessity of partic ipation in Severe Behavior Program. Administration of the assessment instrument must have been completed by the requesting provider or by a professional other than the requesting provider (see above Assessment sections for criteria) within 60 days prior to the start of treatment. Baseline (interim and current as applicable) data (e.g., rate, duration, intensity, and/or episodic severity) of targeted behavior have been obtained, and provided, with dates on which data were collected, for all behaviors and ski lls identified for intervention as obtained through consultation/coordination with current ABA provider (as applicable) and/or direct observation by the requesting Severe Behavior Program provider. Data presented in relation to target behavior meet the def inition of Severe Behavior. The treatment plan/plan of care includes specific safety measures and protocols. EVERNORTH Coverage Policy: EN 0499 6 Consultation with medical and/or mental health professionals has occurred prior to the initiation of the intervention, will be continued on an ongo ing basis, and is specifically documented. + When authorization requests involve coverage of services conducted retrospectively, ALL of the criteria from initiation of treatment section (and continued treatment section as applicable) are met, coinciding with the dates of service identified within the request. Criteria for Continued Treatment with ABA Continued treatment with ABA is considered medically necessary when: (1) the first bullet in the above section for initiation of treatment section was met at the time treatment was initiated; (2) ALL of criteria from initiation of treatment section above are currently met and (3) ALL of the following criteria are met: The treatment plan/plan of care has been updated to address the current identified skill deficits and maladaptive behaviors, as well as progress made across all targeted areas. Baseline, interim and current data have been obtained, and provided, with dates on which data were collected, for all behaviors and skills identified for intervention a cross all settings/environments where treatment has been provided or will occur. The data indicate that there has been ongoing and sustained progress toward mastering the treatment goals. There is evidence of measurable and ongoing improvement in target ed behaviors and skills as demonstrated with the use of a reliable and valid, standardized assessment instrument completed no more than one year from the start date of the continued treatment request . When progress toward mastering treatment and/or stake holder goals, or evidence of measurable and ongoing improvement is not demonstrated, barriers toward progress have been identified, and there is a specific and documented plan to address barriers and evidence of interventions being adjusted through protoco l modification, with continued data monitoring and assessment for effectiveness by the provider. When behaviors and skills have been identified for new and/or proposed intervention (e.g, goals and objectives), baseline data have been obtained and provide d, with dates recorded across all settings/environments in which treatment will occur and are updated as necessary to have been collected within no more than 30 days prior to the implementation of the intervention associated with the identified behavior an d skill. Administration of a reliable and valid, standardized assessment instrument is completed following any break in treatment greater than 60 calendar days. Updated/current data have been collected with dates on which data was collected, for all beha viors and skills identified for intervention across all setting/environments in which treatment will occur following any break in treatment greater than 60 calendar days. Baseline, interim and current data related to stakeholder training goals have been obtained and provided, with dates on which data were collected, indicating all relevant stakeholders continue to actively participate in the treatment and that they are making sustained and ongoing progress toward mastering the stakeholder goals. Experim ental, Investigational or Unproven ABA is considered experimental, investigational or unproven for all non -ASD indications. Intensive behavioral interventions other than ABA are considered experimental, investigational or unproven. Not Medically Neces sary Services that are considered primarily educational or vocational in nature, or related to academic or work performance are considered not medically necessary. Provision of ABA treatment is considered not medically necessary when delivered to the same individual, at the same time as any other treatment modality (e.g., ABA and speech therapy, or ABA and occupational therapy). EVERNORTH Coverage Policy: EN 0499 7 General Background Glossary of Terms TERM DEFINITION Active Treatment Treatment is performed in a manner in which the interventionist is within close enough proximity to the customer to allow for direct engagement in presenting, creating and/or contriving consistent learning opportunities based on structured, planned and int entional intervention strategies or naturally occurring environmental stimuli. Active treatment involves regular engagement of customers and their significant others (Association of Professional Behavior Analysts [APBA], 2017), and may include both systema tic and naturalistic techniques across both individual and group settings (Pellecchia, et al., 2015). Applied Behavior Analysis The science in which tactics derived from the principles of behavior are applied systematically to improve socially significan t behavior and experimentation is used to identify the variables responsible for behavior change (Cooper, et al., 2020). Assessment A developmentally appropriate evaluation tool to ascertain areas of relative strength and deficit across relevant domains, and informs the development of an individualized treatment plan/plan of care, including recommendations for areas of focus, goals of treatment, intensity of service, and mode of service delivery (Council of Autism Service Providers [CASP], 2020). Baseline Data Quantifiable information regarding performance of skill development and behavior reductive targets (as applicable) collected prior to implementation of the independent variable identified as intervention/treatment from which areas of treatment focus and intervention can be identified, the effects of the independent variable can be recognized, and comparative progress can be det ermined (see Demonstration of Progress). Reporting of baseline data includes dates on which the information was collected (Cooper, et al., 2020). Clearly Defined Goals Specifically indicates the target behaviors and expectations included for measur ement within the treatment goal. Identifies the method in which progress will be measured. Operationally defines the behavioral expectation of the customer and degree of independence necessary for mastery of the goal/objective. Clinical Note Requireme nts for written record of documentation for each CPT code billed that includes the start date and time for each service, the end date and time for each service, location of service, the focus of service, a detailed description of what was conducted by the provider during the time of service demonstrating ABA treatment was performed, who was present/who participated in the service, and who rendered the service. Signatures and time stamps of when the note was completed are included. May also be referred to as \"Progress Note,\" \"Psychotherapy Note,\" or \"Session Note\" (United States, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 2004). Comprehensive ABA ABA treatment of multiple affected developmental domains, which may also include reduction of maladaptive behaviors (CASP, 2020). Continued Treatment with ABA Authorization Request An ABA treatment authorization request when, regardless of funding source , the customer has participated in ABA services with the requesting provider within 90 days from the date the authorization request was made. Criterion Referenced Assessments A psychometric property of a standardized assessment that relates to some unit of measure based on the test taker's performance on a set of standard criteria. Scores on criterion referenced assessments are developed by demonstration of a particular skill, milestone or measurable outcome, and are not impacted by other test takers ' performances (Patten & Newhart, 2018). EVERNORTH Coverage Policy: EN 0499 8 TERM DEFINITION Current Data Quantitative information regarding performance generally collected within one month prior to when the treatment plan/plan of care is submitted, which includes dates on which the information was collected. Data The identification of some dimension of behavior, as collected through measurement procedures and presented in a quantifiable format (Cooper et al., 2020). Demonstration of Progress Quantitative information regarding performance as demonstrated through current data in relation to treatment goals/objectives and/or formally administered assessment results, indicating comparable, measurable and meaningful behavior change in relation to quantifiable baseline and/or interim data. Demonstration of progress ind icates practical importance when altering of the behavior produces socially significant and socially important change (Baer et al., 1968). Tracking of progress of goals and within delivered treatment services should be demonstrated through measurement systems that are individualized to the customer, the treatment environment, and the context within which services are conducted (CASP, 2020). Diagnosis A diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is confirmed when the diagnosis has been made based on the criteria in the DSM -5-TR. A confirmed diagnosis of ASD may also be termed a \"medical diagnosis\" of ASD when the diagnosis is made by a healthcare professional who is licensed to practice independently and whose licensure board considers diagnostics to be within their scope of practice. By contrast, educational identification or meeting educational eligibility for services related to autism through the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) may not meet criteria as a formal diagnosis of ASD , unless the above mentioned specifications have also been met. Similarly, a diagnosis is not considered confirmed when it has been termed \"provisional,\" \"proposed,\" \"potential,\" \"at risk of,\" \"rule out\" or any other term used by the diagnosing clinician t o indicate that more information may be necessary prior to confirming the diagnosis. Direct Case Supervision Occurring concurrently with direct treatment, the BCBA is face -to-face with the customer and the technician (e.g., RBT or the BCaBA) delivering the direct treatment. This can include direct observation of treatment by technician, clinical direction on new and revised treatment protocols, and/or monitoring integrity (CASP, 2020). Discharge Criteria Clearly defined, measurable, realistic, and individualized criteria indicating the point at which services are appropriate for discontinuation and/or transf er to alternative or less intrusive levels of care. Criteria should identify quantifiable skill development and behavior reductive targets considered necessary and socially significant, specific to the customer, and be related to the current course of trea tment identified through the customer's treatment plan/plan of care. Discharge criteria should be identified at initiation of treatment, and reviewed and adjusted as appropriate throughout the course of services (ABA Coding Coalition, 2022; CASP, 2020). Focused ABA ABA treatment provided directly to the customer for a limited number of behavior targets (CASP, 2020). Generalization Behavior change that is durable over time, appears in a wide variety of possible environments, can be demonstrated across individuals, or spreads to a wide variety of related behaviors (Baer, et al., 1968). Goals/Objectives Specific, clearly and operationally defined, measurable, realistic and individualized description of the precise skill development and behavior reduc tive targets that represent the focus of intervention within the treatment plan/plan of care. Treatment goals/objectives are based on the areas of deficit identified through the assessments/evaluations administered, and include data collection procedures t hat are consistent with mastery criteria and allow for frequent evaluation. Treatment goals/objectives indicate the number of targets required toward meeting mastery criteria EVERNORTH Coverage Policy: EN 0499 9 TERM DEFINITION (when applicable), and are consistent with the intensity and setting of service p rovision. New treatment goals/objectives are considered on a consistent basis (CASP, 2020). Indirect Case Supervision Case supervisory activities occurring outside of the treatment setting and/or without contact with the client or relevant stakeholders. This can include development of treatment goals, protocols, and data collection systems, analysis of data, evaluation of progress, coordination of care activities with other professionals, meetings with direct staff outside of the treatment setting or without the client present (CASP, 2020). Initiation of Treatment with ABA Authorization Request An ABA treatment authori zation request when the customer has not participated in ABA services with the requesting provider within 90 days from the date the authorization request was made. Interim Data Quantitative information regarding performance from the period of time bet ween when the goal was introduced into treatment and one month prior to the time the treatment plan/plan of care was submitted for review. Reporting of interim data includes dates on which information was obtained. At a minimum, interim data should include the data point as collected for the previous review period. Maintenance The extent to which the customer continues to perform the target behavior after a portion or all of the intervention has been terminated (Cooper, et al., 2020). Mastery Criteria Socially validated performance criteria (Cooper, et al., 2020) that includ es quantitative and measurable conditions and standards that are clearly defined, based on collected data that identifies when a particular target, goal, objective, skill set or behavior has been achieved/accomplished and no longer requires focused and tar geted treatment/intervention. Mastery criteria should be consistent with the units of measurement identified within the goal indicating the standards for determining when a goal/objective has been/will be met, and specifies the number of targets required t o meet the goal/objective (when applicable). Measurable Goals Indicates the method in which data will be collected as a means of demonstrating progress toward mastery of the treatment goal. Includes an operational description of the target behavior using quantifiable terms. Measurable goals incorporate quantitative data collection that coincides with data collection methods used for identifying baseline data, interim data and description of progress through current data. Multiple Procedures Regardles s of the funding source, multiple providers bill for services rendered to the same individual when those services occur at the same time. Also referred to as concurrent billing (American Medical Association [AMA], 2019). Norm Referenced Assessments A psychometric property of a standardized assessment that is designed to compare and rank test takers in relation to the general population. Norm referenced assessments allow for appraisal of the test taker to a hypothetical average test taker, which is determined by comparing scores against the performance results of a statistically selected group of test takers, typically of the same age or grade level (Patten & Newhart, 2018). Observational Treatment Treatment is performed in a manner in which the interventionist does not present consistent learning opportunities (related to reduced proximity and/or limited occasion), and engagement with the customer and their significant others is inconsistent, infrequent, irregular and unreliable. Operational Definition Clearly stated description of the behavior characteristics that is observable, measurable, repeatable and agreeable (Alberto & Troutman, 2013). Qualitative Data Categorized based on traits and characteristics (e.g., anecdotal accounts, des criptive reports, etc.) (Kazdin, 2011). Quantitative Data Counted or measured and reported using numbers (e.g., rate, frequency, percent of opportunities, cumulative mastered targets, percent of momentary time sampling, etc.) (Kazdin, 2011). EVERNORTH Coverage Policy: EN 0499 10 TERM DEFINITION Reliab le Assessments An assessment instrument that produces consistent results across administrations, and when implemented by different people (Patten & Newhart, 2018). Retrospective Treatment with ABA Authorization Request A retrospective authorization request is any reque st made after a specific amount of time for both initial and continued stay requests. A retrospective authorization request for ABA is any request made when more than 90 days have passed since the start date of the requested authorization, or any time afte r the customer has discharged. Severe Behavior Behaviors occur at a rate, duration, intensity and/or episodic severity that directly interferes with autonomy and independence, as well as participation in available learning opportunities presented both th rough the natural environment and applied treatment programs (as applicable). Behaviors are destructive and disruptive to daily life, may result in a risk of harm, and are considered dangerous to the individual, those in direct vicinity of the individual, and/or property (Salvatore, et al., 2022). Severe Behavior Program Provide treatment focused with individuals who engage in Severe Behavior. Participation in treatment is often short -term and directed specifically toward analysis, evaluation, remediation, replacement and/or reduction of severe behavior (Fisher, et al., 2021). Socially Significant Behaviors Behaviors that have immediate and long -lasting effects for the person and for those who interact with that person (Cooper, et al., 2020). Stakeholder(s) An individual, other than the person directly receiving services, who is impacted and invested in the intervention provided (e.g., parent/caregiver, relative, teacher, etc) (BACB, 2021). Standardized Assessments Requires all test take rs to answer the same questions or meet the same criteria. Tests are administered and scored in a similar manner across participants to allow for comparison of performance across administrations and with other test takers (Patten & Newhart, 2018). Transi tion Plan Written plan with treatment targets that must be achieved for each step of a gradual step down in services (CASP, 2020). Treatment Plan / Plan of Care Submitted documentation outlining the course and direction of intervention that guides procedures, and determines recommendations for areas of focus, goals of treatment, intensity of service, and mode of service delivery (Luiselli, 2006). Treatment plans / plans of care include information to substantiate that the medical necessity criteria for Applied Behavior Analysis as outlined in Evernorth Behavioral Health Coverage Policy EN0499 Intensive Behavioral Interventions are met. Valid Assessments An assessment instrument that has been psychometrically tested for reliability (see Reliable Assessments), validity (refers to the test's ability to measure what it is intended to measure), and sensitivity (the probability that the assessment will accurate ly identify and distinguish test taker's performance in meeting set criteria) (Patten & Newhart, 2018). Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a mixed group of neurodevelopmental disorders with diverse etiologies but are characterized by impairments in recip rocal social interaction, social communication, and behavior (restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities). Clinical presentations often include speech/language delays in the first two years of life, plateau of social skills afte r normal early development and lack of interest in socializing (Weissman, 2022). Children with a less severe phenotype may present in kindergarten or later with behavior disturbances or with symptoms of other neurodevelopmental conditions (Augustyn & von Hahn, 2021). Neurodevelopmental conditions that are associated with ASD include: Anxiety disorder Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Oppositional defiant disorder and other disruptive behavior disorders Depression and other mood disorders EVERNORTH Coverage Policy: EN 0499 11 Learning difficulty The precise etiology of ASD is unknown, although there appears to be a high heritability associated with it. The etiology can be identified for between 15% and 20% of individuals with autism; in the others the cause remains unknown. Th is is a field of active research. Associations between ASD and a number of other medical conditions have been proposed. Other medical conditions include: Epilepsy or seizure disorder Tuberous sclerosis Fragile X syndrome Intellectual disability The American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) 2022 Policy Statement on Autism and Vaccines states \"Multiple studies conducted in several different countries have demonstrated that there is no causal association bet ween vaccines or their preservatives and ASD. Further, vaccines do not change the timing of the onset of ASD symptoms, nor do they affect the severity of ASD symptoms. Even in families who have a greater risk for ASD, such as those who already have a child with ASD, there is no increased likelihood that the second child will have ASD if vaccinated.\" Diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder from: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5-TR) A. Persistent deficit s in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, as manifested by all of the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, no exhaustive; see text of DSM -5-TR) 1. Deficits in social -emotional reciprocity, ranging, for example, from abnormal social approach and failure of normal back -and-forth conversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions. 2. Deficits in nonverbal communicative behav iors used for social interaction, ranging for example, from poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication; to abnormalities in eye contact and body language or deficits in understanding and use of gestures; to a lack of facial expressions and nonver bal communication. 3. Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, ranging for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts; to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of interest in peers. Specify current severity: Severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior. B. Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, as manifested by at least two of the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, no exhaustive; see text of DSM -5): 1. Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects, or speech (e.g., simple motor stereotypies, lining up toys or flipping objects, echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases). 2. Insistence on sameness,, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns of verbal or nonverbal behavior (e.g., extreme distress at small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take same route or eat same food every day). 3. Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus (e.g., strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual objects, excessively circumscribed or perseverati ve interests). 4. Hyper - or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling, or touching of objects , visual fascination with lights or movement). Specify current severity: Severity is based on social communication impairments and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior. EVERNORTH Coverage Policy: EN 0499 12 Diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder from: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5-TR) C. Symptoms must be present in the early developmental period (but may not be fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities, or may be masked by learned strategies in later life. D. Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of current functioning. E. These disorders are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently co - occur; to make comorbid diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for general developmental level. The DSM -5-TR notes that individuals with a well -established DSM -IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, or pervasi ve developmental disorder not otherwise specific should be given the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Individuals who have marked deficits in social communication, but whose symptoms do not otherwise meet criteria for autism spectrum disorder, should be evaluated for social (pragmatic) communication disorder. There are no medical interventions that are effective in achieving a cure for autism; however, the condition may be managed through a combination of behavioral, pharmacological and educational interventions. CDC surveillance data published in 2014 revealed that white, non -Hispanic children were approximately 20% more likely to be identified with ASD before the case review than were non -Hispanic African American children and were about 50% more likely to be identified with ASD than were Hispanic children. Recent prevalence data reveal increasing rates of ASD in Hispanic and African American children. This may reflect more widespread awareness of the symptoms among parents, schools, and health car e providers and improved rates of screening in health supervision care. Studies examining the effects of race and ethnicity on age at diagnosis are conflicting, but earlier diagnosis of ASD is associated with higher socioeconomic status and access to servi ces. African American and Hispanic children diagnosed with ASD by age 4 years were more likely to have coexisting intellectual disability than were white, non -Hispanic children, suggesting that some African American and Hispanic children with ASD and avera ge to above -average intelligence may not have been identified (Hyman, et al., 2020). Intensive behavioral interventions are comprehensive treatment programs that utilize a combination of interventions with the aim of improving cognitive and intellectual f unction, social and adaptive skill development and behavior problems. They have been proposed to treat autism spectrum disorders as well as other conditions that involve behavioral difficulties. The programs emphasize early intervention, individualization of treatment and an intensive approach. The programs may also be referred to as early intensive behavior intervention (EIBI), intensive behavior intervention (IBI) or early intensive behavioral treatment (EIBT). At times, the terms EIBI, IBI, EIBT are used interchangeably with applied behavior analysis (ABA), Lovaas therapy or Lovaas University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Program. The term intensive behavioral interventions is used in this coverage policy, but this aligns with adaptive behavior treatme nt that is referenced in Current Procedural Terminology (CPT\u00ae) codes section. There is a formal credentialing process of professional behavior analysts through the Behavior Analyst Certification Board\u00ae (BACB). The BACB credentials and recognizes practiti oners at four levels: Board Certified Behavior Analyst -Doctoral Board Certified Behavior Analyst\u00ae (BCBA) Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst\u00ae (BCaBA) Registered Behavior Technician (RBT) Practitioners credentialed at the BCBA -D and BCBA levels are defined by the BACB as Behavior Analysts. The BACB requires that BCaBAs, or Assistant Behavior Analysts, work under the supervision of a BCBA -D or BCBA. RBTs must work under the supervision of a BCBA -D, BCBA, or BCaBA The BACB provides clinical guidelines regarding the delivery of ABA services as a treatment for ASD. EVERNORTH Coverage Policy: EN 0499 13 A Licensed Behavior Analyst (LBA) is a behavior analyst credential that is particular to a specific state to provide ABA. The programs are intensive and range from 15 to 40 hour s per week, delivered over a long period of time. The intensive behavior programs focus on identifying behaviors that interfere with normal developmental processes, understanding the relationship between a behavior and the child's environment and modifying those behaviors in such a way so as to improve the child's functional capacity. Treatment goals focus on improving adaptive behavior, language/communication skills, decreasing problem behaviors, as well as improving cognitive/intellectual status and acade mic/developmental achievements. Treatment can be delivered in a different settings, including residential treatment facilities, inpatient and outpatient programs, homes, schools, transportation, and places in the community. The main characteristics of ABA should be apparent throughout all phases of assessment and treatment and include the following (Council of Autism Service Providers (CASP), 2020): An objective assessment and analysis of the individual's condition by observing how the environment affects the client's behavior, as evidenced through appropriate data collection. Importance given to understanding the context of the behavior and the behavior's value to the individual, the family, and the community. Utilization of the principles and procedures o f behavior analysis such that the individual's health, independence, and quality of life are improved. Consistent, ongoing, objective assessment and data analysis to inform clinical decision -making. There are two treatment models that exist on a continuum , Focused or Comprehensive ABA treatment. Focused ABA treatment may involve increasing socially appropriate behavior or reducing problem behavior. Individuals who need to acquire skills (e.g., communication, tolerating change in environments and activities , self -help, social skills) are appropriate for Focused ABA. Focused ABA may be delivered individually or as part of a small - group format. Key functional skills can include, establishing instruction -following, social communication skills, compliance with m edical and dental procedures, sleep hygiene, self -care skills, safety skills, and independent leisure skills (e.g., appropriate participation in family and community activities). Severe problem behaviors that may require focused intervention can include, b ut are not limited to, self -injury, aggression, threats, pica, elopement, feeding disorders, stereotypic motor or vocal behavior, property destruction, noncompliance and disruptive behavior, or dysfunctional social behavior (CASP, 2020). There are times w hen an individual with ASD has co -occurring severe destructive behavior disorders that require focused treatment in more intensive settings, such as Severe Behavior Programs that have specialized intensive -outpatient, day -treatment, residential, or inpatie nt programs. The ABA services delivered in Severe Behavior Programs often require higher staff -to-client ratios with close on -site direction from the Behavior Analyst. Additionally, such treatment programs often have specialized treatment environments (for example, treatment rooms designed for observation and to keep the individual and the staff as safe as possible). Participation in severe behavior treatment is often short -term and directed specifically toward analysis, evaluation, remediation, replacement and/or reduction of severe behavior. An assessment should include the following: complete treatment history, which includes previous evaluations, diagnoses, and interventions, as well as a complete history of the targeted severe behavior(s) with response to current and/or previous treatment. Goals should be outcome oriented with clearly defined goals for each patient. Treatment decisions should be based on objective and ongoing measures of the individual's destructive behavior (Fisher, et al., 2021; CASP, 2020). Comprehensive ABA is treatment of the affected developmental domains, such as cognitive, communicative, social, emotional, and adaptive functioning. Maladaptive behaviors, such as noncompliance, tantrums, and stereotypy are the focus of treatment. These programs tend to range from 30 -40 hours of treatment per week (plus direct and indirect supervision and caregiver [stakeholder] training). Initially, this treatment normally involves 1:1 staffing and gradually includes small -group formats. Comprehens ive treatment can be appropriate for older individuals diagnosed with ASD, particularly if they engage in severe or dangerous behaviors across environments (CASP, 2020). The assessment process for developing an individualized ABA treatment plan includes m edical record review for the individuals' medical status, prior assessment results, response to prior treatment and other relevant EVERNORTH Coverage Policy: EN 0499 14 information may be obtained via file review and incorporated into the development of treatment goals and intervention. Indivi duals, caregivers, and other stakeholders are included when setting treatment goals, developing protocols, and evaluating progress. Additionally, direct assessment and data collection are needed to identify pretreatment levels of functioning, developing an d adapting treatment protocols on an ongoing basis, and evaluating response to treatment and progress toward goals. Behavior should be directly observed in a variety of relevant naturally occurring settings and structured interactions (CASP, 2020). ABA tr eatment goals are identified based on the assessment process. Each goal should be defined in a specific, measurable way to allow frequent evaluation of progress toward a specific mastery criterion. Each goal and objective must be individualized and include (CASP, 2020): Current level (baseline) Behavior parent/caregiver is expected to demonstrate, including condition under which it must be demonstrated and mastery criteria (the objective or goal) Date of introduction Estimated date of mastery Specify plan for generalization Report goal as met, not met, modified and include explanation Case supervision activities can be described as those that involve contact with the client or caregivers (direct supervision) and those that do not (indirect supervision ). Direct case supervision occurs at the same time as the delivery of direct treatment to the individual. Direct supervision typically accounts for 50% or more of case supervision and be responsive to individual client needs. The general standard is two ho urs for every 10 hours of direct treatment. When treatment is less than 10 hours per week a minimum of two hours per week of case supervision is required (CASP, 2020). Stakeholder (e.g., parent/caregiver, relative, teacher, and/or other impacted/invested party) training is a part of both Focused and Comprehensive ABA treatment models. Training involves a systematic, individualized curriculum on the basics of ABA. Treatment plans include multiple objectives and measurable goals for parents and the stakehold er. Training involves an individualized behavioral assessment, a case formulation, and then customized educational presentations, modeling and demonstrations of the skill, and practice for each specific skill (CASP, 2020). Transition and discharge planni ng should be individualized and include a written plan with specific details of monitoring and follow -up. Parents, community caregivers, and other involved professionals should be consulted as the planning process accelerates with three to six months prior to the first change in service. Discharge and transition planning involve a gradual step down in services and can require six months or longer (CASP, 2020). Literature Review: The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) published a comparative effectiveness review of the effects of available interventions on adolescents and young adults with ASD (ages 13 to 30) (Lounds, et al., 2012). The review focused on the following outcomes: core symptoms of ASD (impairments in social interaction, communic ation, and repetitive behavior); medical and mental health comorbidities; functional behaviors and independence; the transition to adulthood; and family outcomes. The studies assessed interventions falling into the broad categories of behavioral, education al, adaptive/life skills, vocational, medical, and allied health approaches. The comparators included no treatment, placebo, and comparative interventions or combinations of interventions. Intermediate outcomes included changes in core ASD symptoms and in common medical and mental health comorbidities as well as effects on functional behavior, the transition process, and family outcomes. Long -term outcomes included changes in adaptive/functional independence, academic and occupational attainment or engageme nt, psychological well - being, and psychosocial adaptation. Harms were also assessed. Across all categories of interventions, most studies (n=27) were of poor quality, and none was good quality. Five randomized controlled trials (RCT) were fair quality: f our that investigated pharmacologic agents and one allied health study that assessed a leisure/recreation program. Although positive results may be reported in individual studies, the poor quality of the studies and the lack of replication of the intervent ion studies mean that the strength of evidence for the body of evidence around any specific intervention is currently insufficient. Findings for the interventions included: EVERNORTH Coverage Policy: EN 0499 15 Behavioral: Individual or group -based social skills training: Four poor -quality s tudies, with two reporting on manualized (i.e., has a published treatment manual) intervention. Some gains in social skills on largely parent -reported measures in short -term studies. Two studies lacked comparison groups; diagnostic approach, participant ch aracteristics, treatment fidelity not clearly reported. Computer -based social skills training: Three poor -quality, short -term studies. Some improvements in emotion recognition in treated participants; no differences in measures of generalization. Systemati c diagnostic approach not reported within studies; concomitant interventions and treatment fidelity not reported. Intensive behavioral treatment: One poor -quality case series with diverse participants. Some gains in adaptive behavior reported. Intervention not clearly described; treatment fidelity and concomitant interventions not reported; assessors not masked. Adaptive/Life Skills: Specific life/transitional skills: Three, poor -quality, short -term studies assessing highly specific skills and unique interv entions (e.g., shoe lacing, digital device use, rotating classroom schedule). Some gains seen in individual studies but most lacked comparison groups. Systematic diagnostic approach not reported within studies; participants often not clearly characterized; differences in concomitant interventions and treatment fidelity often not reported. Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH) - based model: One poor -quality cohort study; desirability of living situation an d use of programming rated more highly for TEACCH than other conditions; group homes rated more desirable than institutions. Nonrandom assignment to groups; systematic diagnostic approach not reported within study; inclusion/exclusion criteria not clearly stated; interventions not fully described; assessors not masked. In 2014, the AHRQ published a systematic review that updated the behavioral intervention portion of the comprehensive review of therapies for children with ASD that was published in 2011 (We itlauf, et al., 2014).the review included 65 studies comprising 48 randomized trials and 17 nonrandomized comparative studies (19 good, 39 fair, and 7 poor quality) published since the prior review. The quality of studies improved compared with the earlier review; however, the assessment of the strength of evidence (SOE), confidence in the stability of effects of interventions in the face of future research, remains low for many intervention/outcome pairs. The authors concluded that a growing evidence base suggests that behavioral interventions can be associated with positive outcomes for children with ASD; however, despite improvements in the quality of the included literature, a need remains for studies of interventions across settings and continued improv ements in methodologic rigor. Substantial scientific advances are needed to enhance understanding of which interventions are most effective for specific children with ASD and to isolate elements or components of interventions most associated with effects. There have been several systematic reviews of intensive behavioral interventions for individuals with ASD (Reichow, et al., 2018; Roth,et al., 2014; Bishop -Fitzpatrick, et 2013; Strauss, et al., 2013; Reichow, et al., 2012; Warren, al., 2009; Reichow and Wolery, 2009). While the reviews do note that are some limitations in the lit erature that includes small sample size, length of follow -up, and reliance on data from non -randomized studies, that overall the reviews report positive benefits of the treatment. There are several published studies regarding children with ASD (Mohammadzaheri, et al., 2014; Fernell, et al., 2011; Zachor, et 2010; al., 2005; Sheinko pf and Siegel, 1998). Although many of the studies are limited by the small sample size and the length of time of treatment and follow -up time there is a demonstrated improvement in functional and social adaptation, and cognitive skills including language and communication skills, intellectual function, or other measures for children with ASD. Other Intensive Intervention Programs Intensive intervention programs other than those that focus on behavior analytic treatment have also been developed. The publi shed evidence is preliminary and does not support the efficacy of these programs. These include, but are not limited to: EVERNORTH Coverage Policy: EN 0499 16 TEACCH program: The TEACCH program (Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children) is an education al intervention focused on improving motor coordination and cognitive skills and has been implemented in many special education programs for autistic children. It includes behavioral analytic approaches for some skills but uses other interventions as well. Denver Model: The focus of the Colorado Health Sciences program (Denver Model) is learning through play based on Piaget and object relations theories. Behavior analytic techniques are included for behavior management. Rutgers program: The Rutgers progra m is known as the Douglas Developmental Disabilities Center (based at Rutgers University), has three programs small -group segregated preschool, and integrated preschool and intensive home -based intervention, and uses ABA techniques and similarities to the Lovaas program. Families are trained in the program and provide the treatment when they are available and or hire staff trained in the program. Learning Experiences and Alternative Program (LEAP): LEAP program includes both a preschool program and a behav ioral skill training program for parents, as well as national outreach activities. The program includes an individualized curriculum that targets goals in social, emotional, language, adaptive behavior, cognitive, and physical developmental areas. Relatio nship Development Intervention (RDI): RDI is a program designed to empower and guide parents of children, adolescents and young adults with ASD and similar developmental disorders to function as facilitators for their children's mental development (Gutstei n, 2009). RDI is based on instructing the parents to have an important role in improving critical emotional, social and meta -cognitive abilities through carefully graduated, guided interaction in daily activities. Floortime: this is also referred to as DI R\u00ae (Developmental, Individual Difference, Relationship -based model), DIR\u00ae Floortime, or Greenspan Floor -Time Model. This is a developmentally -based, one -on-one treatment program delivered 10 to 25 hours per week. The primary intervention method used in thi s model is intensive interactive \"floor -time\" play sessions, in which an adult follows a child's lead in play and interaction. The program consists of three components: home -based play sessions, individual therapies, and early education programs. Intensi ve Behavioral Interventions for Other Conditions Although intensive behavioral interventions were developed initially to treat children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) they have been proposed to treat children with other conditions, including Down syn drome, learning disabilities and Attention -Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD. There is a lack of scientific evidence to support the efficacy of the programs for other conditions. ABA has been proposed to treat individuals with Down syndrome. The behavi or and psychiatric problems associated with Down syndrome Assessment should include evaluation of the problem at school and at home, behavior management techniques, and medication as needed (Ostermaier, 2022). The role of ABA in treatment of this condition is unproven and not supported in the published medical literature. Professional Societies/Organizations American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP): The AACAP updated their practice parameters for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders. The guidelines include the following regarding treatment (Volkmar, et al., 2014): The clinician should help the family obtain appropriate, evidence -based and structured educational and behavioral interventions for children with ASD (evidence base: CS). The guidelines note that, \"Structured educational and behavioral interventions have been shown to be effective for many children with ASD and are associated with better outcome. As summarized in the National Research Council (NRC) report, the quality of the research literature in this area is variable, with most studies employing group controls or single -subject experimental methods. In general, studies employing more rigorous randomized group compar isons are sparse, reflecting difficulties in random assignment and control comparisons. Other problems include lack of attention to subject characterization, generalization of treatment effects, and fidelity of treatment implementation. Despite these probl ems, various comprehensive treatments approaches have been shown to have efficacy for groups of children, although none of the comprehensive treatment models has clearly emerged as superior.\" EVERNORTH Coverage Policy: EN 0499 17 Regarding behavioral interventions, the guidelines note that, \" Behavioral interventions such as Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) are informed by basic and empirically supported learning principles. A widely disseminated comprehensive ABA program is Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention (EIBI) for young children, based on the work of Lovaas. EIBI is intensive and highly individualized with up to 40 hours per week of one to one direct teaching, initially using discrete trials to teach simple skills and progressing to more complex skills such as initiating verbal behav ior. A meta -analysis found EIBI effective for young children, but stressed the need for more rigorous research to extend the findings. Behavioral techniques are particularly useful when maladaptive behaviors interfere with provision of a comprehensive inte rvention program. In such situations a functional analysis of the target behavior is performed, in which patterns of reinforcement are identified and then various behavioral techniques are used to promote a desired behavioral alternative. ABA techniques ha ve been repeatedly shown to have efficacy for specific problem behaviors, and ABA has also been found to be effective as applied to academic tasks, adaptive living skills, communication, social skills, and vocational skills. Because most children with ASD tend to learn tasks in isolation, an explicit focus on generalization is important.\" *evidence base for practice parameters: Recommendations for best assessment and treatment practices are stated in accordance with the strength of the underlying empirical and/or clinical support, as follows: Clinical Standard (CS) is applied to recommendations that are based on rigorous empiric al evidence (e.g., meta -analyses, systematic reviews, individual randomized controlled trials) and/or overwhelming clinical consensus. Use Outside of the US National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE): NICE published clinical guidelines for the management and support of children and young people on the autism spectrum. The guidelines include the following recommendations for specific interventions for core features of autism (NICE, 2013; updated 2021): Psychosocial interventions + Conside r a specific social -communication intervention for the core features of autism in children and young people that includes play -based strategies with parents, carers and teachers to increase joint attention, engagement and reciprocal communication in the ch ild or young person. Strategies should: be adjusted to the child or young person's developmental level aim to increase the parents', carers', teachers' or peers' understanding of, and sensitivity and responsiveness to, the child or young person's pattern s of communication and interaction include techniques of therapist modeling and video -interaction feedback include techniques to expand the child or young person's communication, interactive play and social routines + The intervention should be delivered b y a trained professional. For pre -school children consider parent, carer or teacher mediation. For school -aged children consider peer mediation.
