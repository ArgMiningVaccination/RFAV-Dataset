I am sure that you have heard lots of information (and misinformation) about the COVID-19 vaccine. I am not intending to give you a complete re-hash of what is available widely elsewhere (though there are links at the end). I wanted to give you some additional information. A friend and co-worker of my husband's pathology partner, Katalin Kariko (a research faculty member at University of Pennsylvania) was compelled to work tirelessly over decades developing techniques for the development of a new form of a vaccine. People thought that she was crazy to pursue this and she was heavily criticized for this fool's errand. It has come to be that her research was pivotal to the development of this new approach to a vaccination. (See this [link](https://www.optimistdaily.com/2021/01/the-optimist-view-pandemic-breakthroughs-and-the-perseverance-that-pioneers-them/) with more details about this uplifting story). A few key points, COVID-19 is an RNA virus. This vaccine is fashioned to act like an RNA virus. Just like an RNA virus, the mRNA in the vaccine never enters the nucleus of the cell, where our DNA (our genetic material) is kept. Unlike a virus it is unable to replicate. The cell breaks down and removes the mRNA after it has finished being transcribed. The cell then displays the protein piece on its surface. Our immune system recognizes that the protein doesn't belong there and begins making antibodies. I was delighted to learn in my homeopathy class that taking two homeopathic remedies (Thuja occidentalis and Silicea 15c or 30c) taken before the vaccination (10 pellets) and then taking another 10 pellets 1 week later prevents some of the risks and long term problems of vaccinations. This is repeated with the second dose. There has been complete transparency around ingredients in the vaccinations: Lipids (including ((4-hydroxybutl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldanoate), 2[(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide,1,2-Distearoyl-sn-glycer0-3-phosphocholine, Dibasic sodium phosphate dehydrate Sucrose *Good news, there is no aluminum, mercury or food allergens. This is a very different approach than ALL of the previous vaccines. The most commonly reported side effects of the vaccine are: injection site reaction, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever. These short term side effects are easily managed and are part of the immune response, doing its job without an infection. There have been rare anaphylactic responses, which is why vaccine recipients are monitored before they leave the clinic. I encourage you to do due diligence in your exploration and informed consent. This page cannot adequately fill that need. I intend to give you new information. The vaccine has been shown to date to have about a 95% efficiency. For those of you who are aware of the channeled teachings of Abraham-Hicks, Abraham at the end of a recent session where the COVID vaccine was discussed added, \"The Non-Physical Energies are pulsating with throngs of energies who were at one time doctors and scientists, who now stand in their Non-Physical Being-ness, reveling in the brilliance of these vaccines, knowing that what they knew was part of the foundation that is leading to the solution. Each of you is part of that as well. Because Source Energy is always focused upon what is the best for the most.\" I am not someone who has been enthusiastic about vaccines. I have never gotten a flu shot. I take to heart Abraham's words, years ago on vaccines. The danger of a vaccine is a 5, but pushing against a vaccine is a 95. In other words, get it and feel good about it, or don't get it, but we are better off without all of the resistance. My immune system is robust. I have been living without fear in COVID times. I respectfully wear a mask because it does a great job of diverting moisture droplets that we breath out, that the virus rides upon. I have been careful not to contract it and pass it to other people who might be more susceptible. For these reasons it felt good to take the vaccination. I have now had both of my vaccinations. I have ordered a number of Thuja occidentalis vials, and charged them with the energy of Silicea. If you are interested in getting a tube, let me know (text 850-591-9703) or email (amiddleway@comcast.net). One tube treats 2 people for the complete course. Be well and enjoy the Magnificent unfolding of 2021 - there may still be some rough patches still, but like a beautiful flower, it is unfolding, and getting better all the time. A. Lynn "}
