Aromatherapy uses \"essential\" oils because the oil is the \"essence of\" the plant's fragrance. But what exactly is aromatherapy and what are the benefits of incorporating it into your daily routine? Aromatherapy Benefits 101 If you are ready to take a more holistic route to feeling your best, aromatherapy has many benefits. It not only has medicinal purposes, but it also integrates a sense of balance, harmonization, and wellbeing into the mind, body, and spirit. Aromatherapy is a great technique if you're interested in promoting the body's natural healing process and helps to regulate your overall bodily functions. Many fragrances evoke emotional or psychological triggers to the brain, which is then stimulated to release hormones and neuro-chemicals that bring healing changes in the body, and our psychological and emotional reactions. Each essential oil delivers different benefits, some of which include: calming, awakening, energizing, igniting passion, easing pain and more. Aromatherapy can be used to treat a specific ailment, like indigestion, insomnia, acne, aches, and anxiety, or as a way to enhance mood or set the ambiance in a room. Below, you can read exactly what type of essential oils you can use in your home... Why Do People Choose Aromatherapy? Aromatherapy is adopted by many as an alternative medicine in conjunction with prescription and OTC medications. It is a natural, non-invasive way of treating a variety of conditions. Also, there are very few noted side effects (unless you are allergic to a specific plant or essence, so consult your doctor prior to use). This therapy not only heals the body, but it also enhances your senses and mood with the various fragrances. Aromatherapy Recipes to Use at Home Once you get accustom to using aromatherapy, you can have fun eliminating toxic products from your home and replacing them with these natural oils! Below are three ways to get you started straight away. - Headache pain can well, be a pain! But you can alleviate your headache by rubbing a drop of Rosemary or Lavender oil onto the back of your neck. I also love to rub 1 drop of Peppermint oil on my temples, which gives it a cooling sensation. - Adding essential oils to your daily routine can be as simple as upgrading your current [skincare products](http://www.yonkausa.com/products-line/age-defense). The entire line of Yon-Ka products have ingredients that contain the highest quality essential oils that are offered. What I love is that it protects my skin from both external (i.e. cold weather) and internal (i.e. stress) aggressors that can wreak havoc on my skin. - Got a pet? You can create a natural flea collar by saturating a short piece of rope with Tea Tree oil and then roll it up in a handkerchief to tie loosely around the animal's neck. It really works! - Let's talk sleep. Place 1 or 2 drops of sleep enhancing oils such as Chamomile, Lavender, Neroli, Marjoram, or Hops, on your pillow before retiring. You will love the [restful sleep](https://blog.yonkausa.com/10-tips-for-better-sleep/)you get when you do this. How can I get oils? You can find these natural plant oils in your local Whole Foods store, buy your own set of oils from a distributor (Young Living Essential oils is a popular brand), or upgrade when you get your next [spa treatment](http://www.yonkausa.com/find-an-authorized-yonka-center). All Yon-Ka products have ingredients that are derived from natural sources - botanicals, marine extract, and essential oils. If you are looking for an easy way to incorporate the natural therapeutic powers of essential oils while also making your skin appear younger and more vibrant, try their line of [Essential](http://www.yonka.com/en/products-line/essentials) face products. My favorites are their new [Eau Micellaire](http://www.yonka.com/en/product/eau-micellaire) and [Masque 105](http://www.yonka.com/en/product/masque-105). Is aromatherapy safe for everyone? This answer depends on your situation. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should use caution when using [certain types of essential oils](http://www.babycentre.co.uk/x536449/is-it-safe-to-use-essential-oils-while-im-pregnant). As much as essential oils are natural, they have a chemical composition that can be toxic if you don't use them properly. Also, for kids up until 24 months essential oils should be diluted even more than adults as their skin is much more sensitive then yours (same goes for your pets). We recommend that you discuss the proper use of oil treatment with your doctor or [aromatherapy expert](http://www.yonkausa.com/find-an-authorized-yonka-center).
