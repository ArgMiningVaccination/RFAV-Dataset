Its roots are in writings and practices which were developed over millennia. TCM may use acupuncture, herbs and other natural substances, acupressure, food therapy, meditation and exercise to maintain health and treat disease. The Chinese medical view is that each living creature is a small part of the infinite universe, and is subject to the same laws that govern the rest of the cosmos. Therefore, an understanding of health requires an understanding of the laws of nature. The TCM practitioner views health as a state of harmony or balance existing between the internal environment of the body and the external environment it lives in. Unfavorable climactic conditions, emotional upset, physical trauma, infectious organisms, poor nutrition, inappropriate lifestyle, heredity, and other pathogenic factors are capable of disrupting this state of harmony.
