Delayed diagnosis or improperly managed injuries have the potential to prolong the athlete's return to the competition and permanently damage their abilities. We report the case of a 35-year-old male professional basketball player who presented to a chiropractor with pain and swelling of the right fifth finger two days after a basketball game. The injury occurred when a player passed the basketball and the ball hit his fifth finger \"head-on\". Examination revealed enlargement of the middle joint of the right fifth finger and a boutonniere deformity. He was diagnosed with a central slip injury using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Since there are no standard treatment guidelines for central slip injuries, multi-model chiropractic therapy was applied to the injury and adjacent sites. The patient returned to the game by the end of the third week and fully recovered within six weeks. Chiropractors must understand how to best guide athletes' clinical management of these injuries, given the inherent need for immediate and complete recovery.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-02-19", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
