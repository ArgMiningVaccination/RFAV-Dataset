People with ADHD should choose supplements tailored to their unique constellation of symptoms. - Research: Many supplements have scientific research and evidence supporting their use in people with ADHD, while others have more anecdotal evidence in their favor. - Drug Interactions: Some supplements interact with prescription medications, including those for ADHD, in unexpected ways. Consumers should be aware of potential interactions between their current medications and any supplements they plan to take. 1. Magnesium Magnesium is a mineral used in over 300 biochemical reactions in the body. Its main feature is that it helps with the regulation of blood sugar, production of energy, and transmission of impulses through the nerves. People with ADHD also often suffer from magnesium deficiency. This deficiency can worsen ADHD symptoms, including hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity. This may be due to the way magnesium interacts with the nervous system. The effect of magnesium supplements for people with ADHD is that it remedies this common mineral deficiency. The benefit of magnesium supplements for people with ADHD is that it reduces the severity of common symptoms, including those related to social, emotional, and attentive difficulties. Magnesium supplements are particularly effective in children taking stimulant medication to manage their ADHD symptoms. They reduce the severity of the \"rebound effect,\" when ADHD symptoms briefly worsen after stimulant medications wear off. Side effects of magnesium supplements include nausea, stomach cramps, diarrhea, or constipation. Adults should take up to 420 mg of magnesium daily for men or 320 mg for women. Pregnant people should take up to 360 mg per day. Children should take up to 50 mg (ages one to three) or 110 mg (ages 4-8) per day. Consumers should take magnesium supplements with food. These are the top three brands of magnesium supplements for people with ADHD. - Thorne - Ora Organics - BrainMD One thing to note about magnesium supplements is that vitamin B6 improves their bioavailability. This means that taking Vitamin B6 with magnesium makes it easier for the body to absorb. One thing to care about when taking magnesium supplements is that some different forms of magnesium have different effects. For example, magnesium malate is believed to be the easiest form for the body to absorb, while magnesium citrate can cause diarrhea and other unpleasant digestive symptoms. The cost of magnesium supplements varies from brand to brand. For example, you can get 200 capsules of 420 mg each for around $10, which comes down to $0.05 per day. On the other hand, some brands cost around $22 for 120 capsules of 105 mg each, which works out to $0.73 per day. 2. Vitamin D Vitamin D is an essential vitamin that is used in a variety of bodily processes. Its main feature is that it's necessary for building bone, but it's also believed to impact cognitive development. Many children and adults are deficient in vitamin D. However, children with ADHD often have even lower levels of Vitamin D in their bodies than children without ADHD. Though Vitamin D deficiency is not believed to cause ADHD, pregnant people who are deficient in Vitamin D are more likely to have children with ADHD. The effect of supplementing with Vitamin D is that it remedies this common vitamin deficiency. The benefit of Vitamin D supplements for children with ADHD is that they reduce the severity of ADHD symptoms, including hyperactivity, attention deficit, and impulsivity. The side effects of Vitamin D supplements are dry mouth, nausea, and weakness. Continuous overuse of Vitamin D can cause calcium toxicity in the blood, which increases these side effects. According to research, children and adults should take 600 IU of Vitamin D per day. Below are the top three brands of Vitamin D supplements for people with ADHD. - Thorne - BrainMD - Ora Organics One thing to note about vitamin D supplements is that it's hard to overuse them. According to one study, taking up to 50,000 IU of vitamin D per day is safe over time.

Zinc Zinc is a mineral that the body only needs a small amount of each day, but it's used in nearly 100 chemical processes in the body. Zinc's main feature is that it supports immune function, but it's also needed for wound healing, building DNA, and growing cells. People with ADHD often have deficient levels of zinc in their bodies. Symptoms of zinc deficiency often mirror those of ADHD, including inattentiveness and cognitive difficulties. The effect of zinc supplementation is that it remedies this common deficiency. The benefit for people with ADHD who have a zinc deficiency is an improvement in these and other ADHD symptoms. Zinc supplements may also improve the effectiveness of stimulant medications for treating ADHD. The side effects of zinc supplements are uncommon and fairly mild. They may include gastrointestinal upset, stomach pain, and, in extreme cases, headache, fatigue, and fever. However, most people tolerate zinc supplements without any significant negative effects. People with a zinc deficiency should take 7 mg per day (for children), 8 mg per day (for women), or 11 mg per day (for men). A dose of up to 40 mg daily is safe for most adults, but exceeding that amount can cause significant side effects. These are the three top brands of zinc supplements for ADHD. - BrainMD - Thorne - Double Wood Supplements One important thing to know about zinc supplements is that they can reduce impulsive behavior, especially in people with ADHD. Zinc helps the brain manage dopamine production, which helps with impulse control. One thing to care about regarding zinc supplements is that intranasal zinc can impact your sense of smell.

Some brands cost around $10 for 100 capsules of 30 mg each, or $0.10 per day, while others are around $3 for 60 capsules of 22 mg each, or $0.05 per day. 4. Iron Iron is an essential mineral in the body. Its main feature is that it supports the function of red blood cells and energy. Iron deficiencies are common across all populations, but they're even more so in children with ADHD. In one study, 84 percent of children who had ADHD in one study had a significant iron deficiency. This may be because the brain requires iron to produce dopamine, and low dopamine levels are believed to be the primary cause of many ADHD symptoms. The effect of iron supplements is that they remedy this deficiency in people with ADHD. One study found that the benefits of iron supplements are comparable to those of stimulant medications in people with ADHD who have an iron deficiency. Iron supplements are generally well tolerated in people with an iron deficiency, though some side effects are possible. Common side effects include cramping and abdominal discomfort. Serious side effects such as chest or throat pain, bloody stools, or double vision are rare but possible. Adults and children with an iron deficiency should take up to 80 mg of iron daily to experience improvement in ADHD symptoms. These are the top three brands of iron supplements for people with ADHD. - Thorne - BrainMD - Double Wood Supplements One important thing to know about iron supplements is that they can cause constipation, diarrhea, and stomach cramps in some people. One thing to care about regarding iron supplements is that they should only be taken by people with a noted iron deficiency. People without an iron deficiency can easily overdose on iron, which can be serious. Iron supplements are generally inexpensive, costing around $10 for a 100-day supply, or about $0.05 per day. 5. Ginkgo Biloba Ginkgo Biloba is a tree whose leaves are often used in herbal medicine and supplements. The main feature of Ginkgo Biloba is that it increases blood flow in the brain. The effects of Ginkgo Biloba supplements are improved memory retention and speed of mental processing. In people with ADHD, the benefits of Ginkgo Biloba supplements are improved attention when taken with stimulant medication. Side effects of Ginkgo Biloba supplements include upset stomach, dizziness, headache, heart palpitations, and allergic reactions in some people. Ginkgo Biloba is most effective when taken in several doses throughout the day. People with ADHD should take 240 mg or more daily in two to three doses for at least three weeks for improved attention. These are the top three brands of Ginkgo Biloba for people with ADHD. - Thorne - BrainMD Sundown Naturals One thing to know about Ginkgo Biloba is that it's been used in ancient medicine to improve memory and cognitive function for centuries. One thing to keep in mind regarding Ginkgo Biloba supplements is that they're not effective in treating ADHD symptoms on their own and must be used with stimulant medications to be effective. Ginkgo Biloba supplements are fairly inexpensive, but the cost varies from brand to brand. Generally, you can expect to pay around $5 to $10 for a 100-day supply, or around $0.10 per day. 6. Inositol Inositol is a sugar that acts like a vitamin in the body. It occurs naturally in many foods and is produced in the body when you consume carbohydrates. Its main feature is that it helps keep mood hormones and other compounds in the brain balanced. Inositol has a wide range of physical and mental health effects. It improves some people's panic disorder, depression, and bipolar disorder symptoms. The benefits of inositol in people with ADHD are that it increases serotonin activity in the brain, which can improve ADHD symptoms. Side effects of inositol are mild and relatively rare. They include stomach upset, insomnia, and headaches. Taking less than 12 mg of inositol per day can reduce these side effects. Adults and children can take 10 to 18 mg of inositol per day.

One thing to consider with inositol supplements is that studies of their effectiveness for people with ADHD are still ongoing. Most evidence in support of their use is anecdotal at this time. The cost of inositol supplements varies wildly from brand to brand. Some brands sell 100 inositol capsules for $6, which comes out to about $0.06 per day, while others sell around 200 doses of inositol powder for $60, which comes out to about $0.30 per day. 7. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids are essential nutrients that make up the cell walls of the body, aid in the production of energy, and keep many of the body's systems operating smoothly. Omega-3 fatty acid supplements have a wide range of health effects, including reducing inflammation and joint pain, aiding in neurological development, and easing symptoms of depression. People with ADHD often have a fatty acid imbalance, with higher omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3s. The benefits of remedying this balance with omega-3 fatty acid supplements for people with ADHD are improved memory and learning and reduced hyperactivity and impulsivity. Omega-3 supplements have relatively few side effects. Because most are made from fish oil, side effects often include bad breath, nausea, and unpleasant body odor. Some people also experience stomach upset and diarrhea when taking omega-3 supplements. There is no official recommended dose of omega-3 fatty acids for people with ADHD. Children and adults should get between 1,000 and 2,000 mg of omega-3 fatty acids daily for maximum health benefits.

Some brands cost as little as $20 for a 130-day supply, or about $0.15 per day, while others cost as much as $28 for 30 days, which is almost $1 per day. 8. Multivitamin/Multimineral for ADHD Multivitamins and multiminerals are specially formulated combinations of vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients into one easy-to-take supplement. They often combine many essential nutrients with additional ingredients to treat specific conditions. The effects of multivitamins are general improvement of health, boosted immune function, and healthier hair and skin. The benefit of multivitamins for people with ADHD is that they make it possible to combine useful supplements rather than take several different pills simultaneously. The side effects of multivitamins are generally mild, but they may cause stomach upset in some people. They're generally taken once daily, with or without food. The best time to take them is typically in the morning, before breakfast, but taking them with food or on a full stomach may reduce the likelihood of stomach upset. These are the four top brands of multivitamins for people with ADHD.

Its feature is that it controls the body's sleep-wake cycle, also known as the circadian rhythm. The body produces more melatonin after dark, which causes sleepiness, and produces less in response to daylight, causing wakefulness. In people with ADHD, the body doesn't increase melatonin production until much later in the evening. This delay in melatonin onset can cause sleep disturbances and disorders, regardless of whether the person takes stimulant medication to treat their ADHD. The effect of melatonin supplements for people with ADHD is that it boosts melatonin on demand rather than waiting for the body to produce it naturally. Taking melatonin synchronizes the circadian rhythm by telling the body when it's time to sleep. The benefit of melatonin for people with ADHD is that they experience improved sleep quality and fewer sleep disturbances when they take melatonin. Some people with ADHD also experience reduced anxiety by using melatonin supplements. The side effects of melatonin include drowsiness, irritability, dizziness, headaches, and increased bedwetting in young children. However, these side effects of melatonin are rare and generally mild. Melatonin comes in pill, chewable, and gummy forms. Children should take 1 to 3 mg about 30 minutes before bedtime, or up to 6 mg if sleeplessness persists. Adults should take 1 to 5 mg about 30 minutes before bedtime, or up to 10 mg if sleeplessness persists. These are the three top brands of melatonin for people with ADHD. - Nootropics Depot Melatonin Capsules 300 mcg - Nature Made Kids First Melatonin Sleep Gummies 1 mg - Natrol Melatonin Fast Dissolve Strawberry Tablets 10 mg One thing to know about melatonin is that it may be unsafe during pregnancy or breastfeeding, so people who are pregnant or breastfeeding should check with their doctor before taking melatonin. One thing to care about when taking melatonin is that the safety of long-term use has not been studied. Daily use is generally believed to be safe, but the long-term effects of daily melatonin use are unknown, especially in children. The cost of melatonin supplements varies from brand to brand. For example, you can get 120 capsules of 300 mcg each for around $15, which comes down to about $0.12 per day. On the other hand, some brands cost around $17 for 45 gummies of 1 mg each, which works out to $0.37 per day. What Are ADHD Supplements?
