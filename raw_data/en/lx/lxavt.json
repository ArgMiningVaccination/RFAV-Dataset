of 40 Purpose of the Plan The purpose of this plan is to define the pathway by which all public safety professionals within the State of Maine are to be afforded the opportunity to receive the SARS -CoV-2 vaccine to prevent COVID -19 disease. This plan is intended to work in tandem with the plans promulgated by the Maine Governor's Office, Maine Department of Health and Human Services (Maine DHHS), Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC), and the Maine Immunization Program (MIP). The most recent draft of the Maine CDC COVID -19 Interim Draft Vaccination Plan (V 1.0, October 16, 2020) for the State of Maine indicates that first responders will be eligible to receive the COVID -19 vaccine as part of the first phase of distribution when supplies are expected to be scarce.1 This plan is designed to outline a pathway by which all public safety professionals within the State of Maine m ay receive a vaccine as quickly as possible when doses come available. It is important to note that this plan is not intended to override, supe rsede, or supplant the Vaccination Plan developed by Maine CDC. This plan is solely intended to operationalize th e Maine CDC plan to safely deliver COVID -19 vaccinations to public safety professionals throughout the State of Maine. Information Disclaimer It is important to note that this plan is not static, but instead is subject to change as more information is disc overed regarding the epidemiology of the virus , vaccine efficacy, and at -risk populations. This plan will also change as more vaccine variations come available on the market and there is increased access to available vaccine doses. Individuals utilizing th is plan should be sure to monitor the Maine EMS website (www.maine.gov/ems ) to ensure that they have the most up- to-date version of the plan as information within the document is subject to change. Maine EMS and the Maine CDC commit to keeping this plan up to date as timely as possible; however, there may be times where there are delays in producing a new version. In addition, Maine EMS hosts biweekly COVID- 19 Update Briefings via Zoom. The schedule for these meetings can be found on the calendar tool of the Maine EMS website . Background In anticipation of the COVID -19 vaccination, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine compiled a consensus study report outlining potential vaccine allocations 1 Maine CDC. (Oct. 16, 2020). COVID -19 Interim Draft Vaccination Plan: Maine, V1.0. Access on November 10, 2020 from https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious -disease/immunization/documents/covid -19-vaccination - plan -maine -interim- draft.pdf Page 10 of 40 entitled, a Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID -19 Vaccine .2 This report is to be used by organizations like the U.S. FDA, U.S. CDC, Maine DHHS, and Maine CDC to devise the best allocation strategy to safely deliver the vaccine throughout the United States while accounting for risks, maximizing benefits, equality, health equities, fairness, transparency, and scientific evidence. The study places first responders in the first phase of the vaccine distribution plan (pg. 116). The U.S. CDC also has an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) that is charged with developing recommendations for use of vaccines in the United States on civilian populations. This co mmittee is comprised of leading medical and public health experts who offer guidance on the safe use of these measures. The ACIP plays an important role in the allocation of COVID -19 vaccination as they direct the United States strategy based on input from other documents such as the Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID- 19 Vaccine. The ACIP has identified three guiding principles by which it is using to determine the allocation strategy based on the very limited supply of vaccine: science, implementa tion, and ethics. As a result of their work they have broken Phase 1 into three parts based on the very limited supplies available throughout the United States. In their first phase, Phase 1A, they have designated healthcare personnel, including emergency medical services clinicians , and long - term care facility residents as the individuals who will be receiving the initial doses. This weighs the overall risk to these populations in terms of contracting the virus as well as morbidity and mortality data (i.e., mortality rates in long -term care facilities is significantly higher than any other population).3 The ACIP has further de signated that essential workers (including firefighters, law enforcement, and emergency medical dispatchers (EMDs) ) will be prioritized in Phase 1B. These subphases within Phase 1 will be occurring simultaneously where Phase 1B will begin in the middle of 1A as soon as vaccine supplies are available to support the additional individuals (see Figure 1) . All persons working in these fields are eligible to receive the vaccine within the initial phase regardless of whether they function in paid or volunteer 2 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

Maine EMS will identify the two to three largest EMS agencies within each county based on their number of affiliated staff within the Maine EMS eLicensing system. The office will coordinate with these agencies to determine their level of interest in participating in this pilot program to vaccinat e public safety professionals throughout the county where the ir primary base of operations is located. They will have access to the plan to better understand the intentions of the office as well as the Maine Department of Health and Human Resources. Maine EMS will coordinate with them to ensure that they have 4 See Footnote 2 5 Due to the nature of the public safety workforce, there are duplicate counts. For example, many firefighters also hold an EMS certification. There isn't enough information to tease this information apart at this time and so this table highlights the max imum number of individuals in each of these categories from the most recent data source. 6 Maine EMS. eLicensing System Report - All Maine Active Personnel.

In the event that organizations are not interested in participating in the process, Maine EMS will proceed to the next largest EMS agency within that county to understand their interest in participating in the program. Once Maine EMS has secured their commitment , the office will assist the agency in working through the logistics described in this plan. Maine EMS envisions that there are two pathways by which EMS organizations will work to deliver the vaccinations to public safety professionals: hospital -based sy stem that is managed by the health system and independently as a designated COVID- 19 vaccine provider. It is important to note that in the initial phases of this administration plan, these agencies will be serving as pilot organizations to assist with the office navigating the logistics of transitioning a select group of EMS clinicians into a role of vaccinators. It is likely that going forward, subsequent administration campaigns in later stages of Maine CDC's plan may require varying strategies that will be developed overtime. Hospital Partnerships There are multiple EMS agencies that are directly affiliated with healthcare systems throughout the State of Maine as well as others that maintain close ties but aren't a subsidiary of the health system. As heal thcare systems throughout the state receive allocations of the vaccine, they will likely need to pull in resources from their partner EMS agencies to support vaccination efforts within their system. In this scenario, EMS clinicians will be able to work wit hin their scope to provide vaccination support to the existing hospital infrastructure. Individuals administering vaccinations on behalf of healthcare systems will need to directly enter records within the health system's electronic health record or other system s designed for collecting vaccination information. EMS clinicians in this model will serve exclusively to fill the role of administering the vaccination unless otherwise directed by the health system as part of their vaccination management plan. If E MS agencies intend on billing directly for vaccine administration costs (discussed below), they will need to complete the application process to become a COVID -19 Vaccine Provider with Maine CDC and Maine EMS and document within the M aine EMS & Fire Incide nt Reporting System (MEFIRS). It should be noted that during Phase 1 of the Maine CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Plan EMS agencies partnering with health systems must agree to participate in vaccinating public safety professionals within the designated county . Designated COVID -19 Vaccine Provider Agencies that intend on offering vaccinations directly to the public safety community and ultimately the public outside of an existing vaccination program recognized by the MIP will need to become a designated COVID -19 Vaccine Provider with t he U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Maine CDC. The application process to become Page 13 of 40 recognized in the State of Maine is accessible on the Maine CDC MIP website (see Appendix A for sample). These organizations will be independently authorized to deliver COVID- 19 vaccine throughout the State of Maine in alignment with the immunization plan that is promulgated by the Maine CDC that is specific to the needs of the state. Organizations that are authorized by U.S. CDC, Maine CDC, and Maine EMS will be eligible to receive direct shipments of COVID -19 vaccine . Shipments will be determined based on number of individuals that need to be vaccinated in each county a nd the daily throughput capacity of the organization to administer vaccinations. Based on the various formulations of the vaccine that are likely to be available for administration, there will be various shipment sizes. Some vaccines will be shipped in bulk due to the need for ultra -cold (-60 to -80\u00b0C) chain storage. EMS agencies will likely be ineligible to receive these vaccination shipments directly because of their lack in capacity to maintain ultra- cold temperatures ; however, other vaccine products may be shipped directly if they do not require special equipment or services (i.e., ultra- cold storage) . There will be capacity through the Maine CDC's plan of vaccine distribution throughout the state for organizations to acquire this vaccine through vaccine transfers that will be described later in this document. The Pfizer vaccine will be able to be stored temporarily for up to five days in refrigerators until use . This will help to minimize inequities regarding the distribution of the vaccination because the vaccine depots are pre -positioned throughout the state. Additionally, EMS organizations that are ap proved as providers will be able to request aliquots of vaccine from the Maine CDC's Public Health Emergency Preparedness warehouse supply in consultation with the MIP . Statewide Capacity In the State of Maine there are 4,900 licensed EMS clinicians that will be authorized to deliver vaccines after completing the appropriate training required by Maine EMS. Th is number includes 1,448 paramedics and 875 AEMTs who already have intramuscular in jections as part of their standard scope of practice within the State of Maine. On December 2, 2020, the Maine Board of EMS voted unanimously of the members present to expand the scope of practice of EMTs to include the administration of vaccine .9 This mov e was based on established practices where EMTs are already authorized to administer intramuscular epinephrine . The 2,577 EMTs will be able to assist with vaccine administration under the supervision of a higher -level clinician (i.e., AEMT, paramedic, RN, MD, DO, etc.) and following the completion of the standardized training course called Ready, Check, Vaccinate. It is important to note that EMTs will not be able to administer the vaccination without at least one paramedic or higher -level healthcare clinic ian on site at the location where the vaccination is being delivered. In this 9 See Minutes from December 2, 2020 Maine EMS Board Meeting Page 14 of 40 situation, there must be at least an AEMT, paramedic, nurse, physician assistant, advanced practice nurse/nurse practitioner, or physician physically present at the location for them to be able to administer the vaccine so that the higher -level clinician can assist in managing any complications that may arise. EMS organizations already have pre -existing relationships with other public safety partners within the community that the y serve and so utilizing those existing connections will help to facilitate identification of groups that need to be vaccinated. It will be important for organizations within each county to identify all the active members of their respective public safety entity (i.e., fire, police, dispatchers, EMS) so they can be vaccinated. While the estimates reflected in the background section of this document represent the high- end, it is likely that many of the fire personnel listed also hold an EMS license as well. This reduces the burden on the identified EMS organizations in that there are fewer people that will likely need the vaccination.

Specifically, the service will need to identify the following aspects of their program in order to be considered as part of this pilot and likely as part of subsequent vaccination efforts. Physician Medical Director Physician medical directors are a required component of the COVID -19 Vaccine Pr ovider Application process. All organizations that wish to participate in this program will need to have a medical director that will provide general medical oversight to the program. This individual will also serve as the Chief Medical Officer on the pape rwork that is required by the U.S. and Maine CDC to become a vaccine provider. They must be in good standing in the State of Maine with their respective licensure b oard (i.e., Board of Licensure in Medicine and Board of Osteopathic Licensure). This individ ual will be responsible for general oversight of the program within EMS agencies and quality assurance efforts. They will also serve as a resource to the agency and vaccination administration team if they are to encounter any emergencies or irregularities during vaccine administration. The medical director will be required to sign the provider application with the U.S. and Maine CD C. Dedicated Vaccination Team The agencies selected to participate in this pilot program will ideally commit to establishing a dedicated vaccination team of staff members who will be solely dedicated to vaccination efforts of the public safety community within their county. This will be stand- alone, and they may not function as part of the 911 or interfacility transport system duri ng periods when they are conducting vaccination campaigns. For instance, they cannot host a vaccine clinic while on a 911 shift where they may have leave mid- campaign to run an emergency call for service. The Page 16 of 40 team will likely need to be comprised of at least three to six qualified personnel as well as adequate support resources to ensure that they can efficiently and effectively conduct vaccine clinics throughout the county . EMS organizations that choose to participate will be required to identify the indiv iduals that they intend on serving on the vaccination team. It will be important to identify alternative members in case individuals on the team are unavailable (e.g., vacation, out sick, personal leave, etc.) . The agency will not be limited to only using these specific individuals as part of their vaccination campaigns; however, these should be the primary EMS clinicians who will be responsible . It is important to note that all individuals who are administering the vaccine will need to complete the appropr iate training on the Maine EMS Education (MEMS Ed) learning management system. As soon as more information is available about the vaccine, this training will become available to all licensees. While this is the recommended strategy from Maine EMS, we will also be open to considering other pathways to operationalize administration of this vaccine locally. We understand the complex burden that staffing may pose for many agencies. Maine EMS will work with each identified agency to ensure that they have a signi ficant plan in place to provide staffing, as needed for vaccinations to occur within the county. Medical Waste Capacity While most agencies already have existing agreements and capacity to manage medical waste, it will be important for the EMS agencies th at choose to participate in this program to clearly identify their capacity to support the increase in medical waste that will come as a result of vaccine administration (i.e., sharps) . Some organizations have agreements with health systems or hospitals th at allow them to leave behind sharps containers , but those same agreements may not include significant increases in waste that may come as a result of these campaigns. Agencies should prepare to have multiple sharps containers available at each vaccination clinic. Personal Protective Equipment The U.S. CDC has indicated that shipments of the vaccine will include some pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) ; however, it may or may not include all necessary PPE. They have indicated that the ancillary supply kits will include four surgical masks and two face shields for vaccinators.10 Based on the U.S. CDC's guidance regarding personal protective equipment, Maine EMS is recommending that vaccinators wear at least a surgical mask or higher for respiratory protection, eye protection in the form of a face shield or wrap -around glasses, and 10 U.S. CDC. (2020). COVID -19 Vaccination Program Interim Playbook for Jurisdiction Operations - October 29, 2020. Accessed on December 12, 2020 from https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz -managers/downloads/COVID- 19- Vaccination -Program -Interim_Playbook.pdf Page 17 of 40 gloves.11 Clinicians may use goggles in place of the face shield or wrap -arou nd glasses. If any of the equipment becomes visibly soiled or grossly contaminated it should be discarded and new PPE should be donned. U.S. CDC indicates that gloves are optional for administration of intramuscular vaccinations; however, Maine EMS is conc erned that this is contrary to established practices of the profession and may constitute a safety hazard for vaccinators.12 As such, Maine EMS is requiring the use of gloves for COVID- 19 vaccine administration. Gloves should be changed between each patient and vaccinators should practice hand hygiene (i.e., hand sanitizer) .13 Agencies should be prepared to provide persons receiving the vaccine a face covering or face mask in the event they report to the site without a mask. In alignment with Executive Orde r No. 19 FY 20/21 from Governor Janet Mills issued on December 11, 2020, agencies must require that persons entering their building or other public space s where the vaccine is being administered wear at least a face covering at all times. If someone is una ble to wear a face covering or mask, then the agency should make every attempt to make a reasonable accommodation s to ensure that they are able to receive the vaccine (i.e., administer the vaccine in their car) without potentially putting others at higher risk of exposure .14 Vaccine Storage Capacity Maine EMS agencies that participate in this program will need to acquire , if necessary, and designate a refrigerator that will specifically house the vaccines when th ey are on site and be able to maintain temperatures of 2 -8\u00b0C (35.6 -46.4\u00b0 F). If an EMS agency has an existing refrigerator then they must completely remove all other food products and dedicate it exclusively to the storage of vaccinations and/or medications . If the service must purchase a refrigerator, most commercially available refrigerators will work including undercounter refrigerators. Refrigerators that contain a freezer section within the refrigerator section (e.g., many dorm style fridges) will not b e accepted as they do not maintain consistent temperatures throughout the space. Maine EMS is working to partner with community organizations to assist with offsetting the costs associated with acquisition. If agencies need assistance with purchasing a refrigerator, they should reach out to the Maine EMS office so that we can help 11 Natio nal Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. (2020).

Any questions regarding the suitability of a refrigerator should be directed to the MIP by emailing immunizeme.dhhs@maine.gov or calling (207) 287 -3746. After securing a suitable refrigerator, add water bottles labeled (DO NOT DRINK) on the bottom and top shelves as well as in the door. These bottles will help to maintain temperatures within the unit if there is a power failure. Food products must not be stored in this space . The organization will need to provide digital photographs of the refrigerator to the Maine CDC as part of the application process. The device should be placed in a secure location to protect the security of the vaccines but accessible to assigned personnel so that they can m onitor temperatures daily. Maine CDC's MIP has agreed to distribute electronic digital data loggers that will serve as temperature monitoring devices. MIP will send these via mail to the service once it has been approved. The devices will all be pre -calibrated and ready to use. Services will be required to ensure that the vaccines are maintained at the appropriate temperature to prevent excursion (temperature variations) and the viability of the doses. U.S. CDC requires daily temperature monitoring and repo rting via their online system. Training will be provided by MIP on how to document and report these temperatures. Documentation Tools Maine EMS is requiring that EMS agencies participating in this program utilize iPads to document vaccine administration within the MEFIRS system . iPads have the unique capability of scanning driver's licenses within the documentation system. This will improve the throughput speeds of vaccine administration and more importantly consistency in demographic information. By scanni ng the driver's license, it automatically import s the basic demographic information (name, date of birth, address, etc.) which helps to avoid transcription errors that may occur if they are entered manually. This will aid Maine EMS and the MIP when connecting the patient care reports from the first dose of the vaccine series to the second dose. While many, if not most, EMS agencies already use iPads for documentation purposes of traditional 911 calls, if an organization doesn't have access to these devices they should reach out to Maine EMS for assistance. Maine EMS is working to partner with community organizations who may be willing to assist with procurement of iPads to help improve the efficiency of the vaccine administration process. Logistics Maine EM S continues to work closely with the Maine CDC and other agencies regarding the logistics processes that will be associated with the safe and reliable delivery of the COVID -19 vaccine to agencies that have agreed to participate. MIP indicates that first re sponders will likely be receiving exclusively the Moderna vaccine pending its approval or issuance of an Page 19 of 40 Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). This vaccine does not require ultra -cold storage and so will be easier to manage logistically. That said, Maine EMS continues to build contingency plans for how the Pfizer vaccine may be used if the Moderna vaccine is delayed or not authorized. The Pfizer vaccine would likely be shipped from the state's stockpile as a just -in-time shipment because it must be maintained at ultra -cold temperatures until no more than five days prior to administration. Maine CDC and the ir Public Health Emergency Preparedness Program to solidify the logistics associated with these shipments. They will likely be shipped in specialized containers that contain dry ice. It is important the receiving agencies handle the dry ice with care as direct contact with bare skin can cause localized frostbite and tissue damage. For planning purposes, agencies should operate under the assumption that they likely will be working exclusively with the Moderna vaccine until other vaccines come on the market. In the initial weeks of vaccine deployment, the Moderna vaccine will be received and reshipped from Maine CDC's public health warehouse. Moving forward after that point, the Moderna vaccine will likely be shipped directly to participating EMS agencies in 100 dose increments. The agency will be responsible for maintaining appropriate temperatures for this vaccine and will be required to use all 100 doses within the storage window that is detailed by the manufacturer. It should be noted that ther e have been fluctuations in the preliminary reports coming from sources kn owledgeable of the Moderna vaccine that its shelf -life in standard refrigeration may be anywhere from seven to thirty days. Storage practices will be solidified prior to distribution of the vaccine and will be communicated by the MIP , Maine EMS, and the va ccine manufacturer. It is imperative that agencies participating in this program, utilize the vaccine as quickly as possible to avoid any possible wastage. There is a potential that the shelf- life for the vaccine may be adjusted in the future as more information comes available about the viability of the vaccine for longer periods of time. The initial requirements will likely be conservative to maintain consistency but as more data comes to light then it may be adjusted. Administration Plans Each of the EMS agencies within each county will need to coordinate to figure out the best pathway to ensure safe and equitable delivery of the COVID- 19 vaccine to all public safety professionals throughout their county. Maine EMS appreciates the complexities of each loc ality and will advise on these plans to the best of our ability; however, we cannot offer a standardized plan for the entire state on delivery because each county is so unique. Maine EMS strongly encourages the inclusion of local and county emergency manag ement agencies as resources to assist with planning and coordination throughout the county. Each organization will need to develop a vaccine delivery/administration plan that is compatible with their organization and the resources that they have available for vaccination. There are a variety of options that agencies could use to achieve this goal including, but not limited to: Page 20 of 40 Drive -through clinics where individuals drive through the bay and receive their vaccination and speak on the phone to someone enter ing their information into the documentation system Standard clinic settings with scheduled appointments where persons can come in and receive the vaccination at a specific date and time (remote or at the agency's primary base location) Walk -in clinics may be established where they communicate to the public safety community that they will be administering the vaccine between specific hours on a certain day (Note: it will be imperative that if agencies choose this method they are able to implement social dis tancing strategies to ensure that there are not lines, crowding, or situations where the virus may be spread if persons are asymptomatic, positive cases) Strike teams may be set up that go and deliver the vaccine to a specific group of people in a targeted manner This list is certainly not exhaustive; however, it details some potential options that agencies may use to deliver vaccine . Agencies must coordinate their vaccination campaigns with the other authorized vaccine programs within their county to ensure that they are delivering the vaccine equitably and efficiently. Maine EMS and the MIP commit to serving as technical assistance at any point in this planning and implementation process and we are aware that there may be situations that present themselves requiring that these strategies to be modified quickly and without traditional notice. MIP is actively working to procure a sche duling tool that will assist agencies that wish to set up traditional clinics. This tool will enable persons to register and sign up for a specific time for when they can receive their vaccination. Once this product becomes available, Maine EMS will releas e information to all agencies involved on how to begin setting up and using the tool to assist them with vaccine delivery. It will be important for the authorized agencies for each county to obtain rosters from all public safety organizations operating wi thin their county . This may be more easily accomplished by partnering with the county EMA as they often have pre -established relationships with these organizations. It is important that agencies be as thorough as possible when identifying law enforcement, EMS, fire, and emergency dispatch organizations. For example, one might not think of the U.S. Marshal's Office; however , there are at least two locations within the State of Maine that should be accounted for during planning. Maine EMS and the Department o f Public Safety (DPS) commit to assisting as much as possible in the aggregation of these lists for each county, but most local agencies have greater situational awareness of the resources that are in their communities. Page 21 of 40 As part of the planning process, age ncies must also account for the fact that they must observe the recipient for at least fifteen (15) minutes following administration of the vaccine. Persons can potentially return to their cars and sit there and wait to complete their waiting period; howev er, this is designed to ensure that in the unlikely event that there is a severe adverse reaction those persons have access to care. In order to minimize the time that is required for persons to be on site, one solution may be to have persons be vaccinated first and then complete the documentation after. This would economize on the time required as part of the waiting period and will potentially minimize the total time that persons would spend on site. It is critical that if this model is followed that the administered clinician obtain informed consent prior to administration of the vaccine. Maine EMS anticipates that the bottleneck in this process will likely be associated with documentation process. The Maine EMS office has worked diligently to try and streamline the vaccination record that will be used to document administration. That said, the initial dose will likely approximately six to seven minutes for clinicians or other authorized pe rsons to document the record. When the individual receives their second dose in the series, the process will likely be significantly quicker with estimated documentation times of two to three minutes. If agencies can commit three to five people to vaccination efforts, Maine EMS recommends that the ratio be weighted where there are more persons completing documentation than there are vaccinating. Maine EMS is operating under the assumption that one person can vaccinate approximately four to five people per h our if they are administering the vaccine and documenting themselves. If using a team approach, Maine EMS estimates that the throughput per hour could be upwards of 15 to 20 people per hour depending on the number of staff and model. Maine EMS is requiring that EMS agencies participating in this program detail their vaccine administration plan and how their site will work and handle patients in writing . It will be crucial for agencies to review this plan internally and to ensure that their vacc inators and other persons involved are intimately familiar with how the plan is organiz ed and the patient flow. The Maine EMS will be available for technical assistance for any agency wishing to discuss their vaccine administration plan and wanting feedbac k and/or input. Supplies and Equipment It will be important that participating agencies consider what supplies and equipment will be necessary for the administration of this vaccine including, but not limited to, PPE; ancillary supplies, and safety equipm ent. Maine EM S has created a list of supplies and equipment below that is based off the guidance that was provided by the U.S. CDC. These lists are likely not exhaustive but should assist agencies in the planning process. A checklist with these items can be found in Appendix B . Page 22 of 40 Personal Protective Equipment The required PPE can be found on page 16 of this document. It includes at least surgical masks , eye protection (face shield, wrap -around eyewear, or goggles), and glov es. As was discussed in the preceding section, four surgical masks and two face shields will be provided as part of the ancillary supply kits associated with every 100 doses of Moderna vaccine that are received. Agencies will be responsible for ensuring that all persons participating in the administration team be properly outfitted in appropriate PPE. Agencies may opt to increase the level of protection to aerosol precautions; however, in doing so they should take into consideration their available PPE supp lies. Agencies must attempt to secure supplies through their existing supply chains before reaching out to the county EMA or the Maine CDC for assistance with PPE supplies. If those supply chains are overwhelmed or are unable to source appropriate equipmen t, requests can be made from the stockpile. It should be noted that there is a limited supply of PPE within the state stockpile and so requests for PPE related to vaccine administration may be scrutinized to a greater degree to ensure that the agency did e verything in their power to meet the need locally. Intramuscular Vaccine Administration Equipment The U.S. CDC has indicated that the ancillary supply kits that accompany every 100 doses of the Moderna vaccine will include the following equipment : Needles, 105 per kit (various sizes 22 to 25 -guage, 1 -1.5\") Syringes, 105 per kit (ranging from 1 -3 mL) Alcohol prep pads, 210 per kit COVID -19 vaccination record cards for vaccine recipients, 100 per kit Vaccine needle guide detailing the appropriate length gau ge for injections based on route, age (for children, when authorized), gender, and weight (for adults)15 It should be noted that at this time, Maine EMS nor the MIP knows what brand or style of needles will be provided as part of the kits. It will be important that training officers and other members of the participating agency's leadership team ensure that there is just -in-time training on use of the needles and their associated safety features (i.e., safety needles with flip covers). We know that man y agencies exclusively use safety needles for intramuscular injections; however, these needles may or may not be the same. 15 U.S. CDC. (2020).

Accessed on December 12, 2020 from https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz -managers/downloads/COVID- 19- Vaccination -Program -Interim_Playbook.pdf Page 23 of 40 Safety Equipment /Emergency Medical Supplies It is important that persons on site be prepared to respond to an emergency should it ar ise as they should with the administration of any medication including other vaccines. Maine EMS is requiring that agencies participating in this program have access to the following items , at a minimum, to enable a response in the event there is a signifi cant adverse reaction:16 All equipment associated with the provision of Gold 1: Allergy/Anaphylaxis Protocol based on the level of clinician available at the site (i.e., EPINEPHrine, diphenhydramine, IV supplies, fluids, etc.)17 Cell phone or radio to activate local 911, transport unit, and/or higher -level of care Blood pressure cuff Pen light Oxygen Stethoscope Pulse oximetry Tourniquet Basic first aid supplies Miscellaneous Additional Equipment Sites will need to make sure that they have the following items to help with the administration of the vaccine: Alcohol- based hand sanitizer (at least 60% alcohol) EPA-registered antimicrobial products to sanitize spaces and surfaces Sharps containers Trash cans for non- regulated medical waste (e.g., bandage wrappers, etc.) and bags Vaccine information statements (VISs) and emergency use authorization (EUA) documentation for each person that is receiving the vaccine. (Note: if administering the vaccine to the general public later , agencies will be required to be able to provide these documents in the primary language of the recipient) Signage for patient flow and directions for persons participating in the clinic to encourage physical distancing and ideally one-way flow through the clinic Adhesive bandages (e.g., Band- Aids) 16 U.S. CDC.

Maine EMS is creating a custom patient record that will include all the specific elements required within the Maine Immu nization Information System ( ImmPact). This system is intended to be a re pository for accurate and up -to-date immunization records for all persons born, residing, or receiving vaccine in the State of Maine. Services will be required to enter into a standar d User Agreement with MIP. Maine EMS is creating a custom upload that will be able to be imported into the ImmPact system to document administration of the vaccine. All EMS clinicians will be required to complete vaccine documentation records within 12 hours following the administration of the vaccine . These should ideally be completed in real -time during vaccine administration but must be finalized within this window. The record must be submitted to Maine CDC within 24 hours following the administration of the vaccine to maintain compliance with standards set forth by the U.S. CDC. Maine EMS is working collaboratively with the MIP to automate the submission process so that this is done automatically without any additional actions on the part of the clinician or the agency. Most vaccines that are anticipated to come to market soon are comprised of a two-dose series. It is imperative to ensure that that all patient demographic information is complete and accurate so that it can be appropriately reported within the ImmPact system. In order to do so, Maine EMS requires that EMS clinicians administering the COVID -19 vaccine scan each patient's driver's license for consistent demographic information. If for some reason the individual does not have a driver's licens e on their person or they have not been issued a driver's license or identification card, it is imperative that the clinician document the individual's demographic information as thoroughly and completely as possible. Information on their driver's license or identification card can be used to populate the system by using an Apple iPad product. Ensuring consistency in the patient demographic information will allow for easier matching of records from each administration o f the vaccine. If someone has moved or legally changed their name and the information is different than what is on their driver's license, edit the fields after scanning and update it with the most current information. If it is the second dose of vaccine, ensure that individual has not moved since their first dose, enter in the same information that was used for the first dose. In addition to the electronic patient care reporting system, Page 25 of 40 vaccinators will also be required to complete the vaccination record c ards that are going to be included in the ancillary supplies associated with shipments of vaccines. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) An adverse event following immunization is an adverse health problem or condition that happens after vaccina tion (i.e., a temporally associated event). It might be truly caused by the vaccine or it might be purely coincidental and not related to vaccination. CDC continuously monitors the safety of vaccines given to children and adults in the United States. VAERS , co- administered by CDC and FDA, is the national frontline monitoring system for vaccine safety. VAERS is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems with vaccines. Anyone - an EMS clinician, doctor, nurse, pharmacist, or any member of the general public - can submit a report to VAERS. The main goal of VAERS are to: Detect new, unusual or rare adverse events that happen after vaccination Monitor for increases in known side effects Identify potential patient risk factors for particular types of health problems related to vaccines Assess the safety of newly licensed vaccines Detect unexpected or unusual patterns in adverse event reports Per the CDC COVID -19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement, COVID -19 vaccination providers are required to report adverse events following COVID -19 vaccination and should report clinically important adverse events even if they are not sure if the vaccination caused the event. Events can be reported by going to the VAERS Reporting Portal (https://vaers.hhs.gov/ ). Training There is a substantial training component required to safely and effectively participate in this vaccination effort . All Persons Involved in Vaccination Campaign All persons involved in the vaccination campaign will be required to online complete training that is offered by Maine EMS regarding the vaccination itself and considerations when administering the vaccine. This training will include information about the vaccine, guidance on adminis tration techniques, and other attributes of the vaccine administration process. This course is still being constructed and will be released as soon as the EUA information is released Page 26 of 40 for the Moderna vaccine. This course will be available on MEMSEd for lice nsed EMS clinicians and will also be made publicly available for other public safety professionals who would like to learn more about the vaccine. EMTs involved in the process will also need to take an additional specialized training that refreshes them how to draw up a medication and perform an intramuscular injection. EMTs must have documented proof that they have completed the Maine EMS Ready, Check , and Vaccinate Training Program (under development) on MEMSEd in order to participate. Individuals who complete the training will need to demonstrate competency by performing the skill in front of a qualified evaluator b y identifying the appropriate site for vaccine administration, the deltoid muscle. Qualified evalu ators may be AEMTs, parame dics, physicians, physician extenders, or nurses. Vaccine Coordinators Every service must identify a primary and secondary v accine coordinator. These individuals will be responsible for receiving specialized training from Maine CDC's MIP program regarding storage and handling, administration, documentation, and an overview of the vaccines themselves . Vaccine coordinators will be responsible for maintaining an active ImmPact User Agreement that allows them access into the ImmPact system. Imm Pact Training ImmPact training will include topics such as t emperature logging, reconciliation of vaccination supplies , and ordering . This training will be required for both the primary and secondary vaccine coordinator for each agency that chooses to participate in this initial phase. It is estimated that this training will take approximately one (1) hour. The training will be administered virtually by the Maine CDC's MIP program staff and will be specifically tailored for EMS organizations in the State of Maine. In order to receive vaccines organizations must have at least one individual who ha s completed the training. Storage and Handling Maine CDC's MIP program will also host a storage and handling course that will be specifically tailored to EMS organizations. It will focus on techniques to manage the vaccine as well as action steps that must be taken in the event of temperature excursion or temperature that are outside the specified range. This training is estimated to take approximately one (1) hour and will be conducted virtually. Maine EMS will assist in coordinating dates when this training will be offered. Specific Vaccine Training MIP will provide specific vaccine training for each vaccine type as it enters the market. More information will be made available to the coordinators regarding this training as soon as the Page 27 of 40 data is released to the MIP. The MIP office will reach out to vacci ne coordinators directly to arrange this virtual training. This training will include information regarding reconstitution, if applicable, and vaccine administration guidance as well. Billing and Reimbursement The operational costs of EMS organizations pr oviding vaccinations for the public safety community and ultimately the general public will likely be vast. We have explored payment and reimbursement opportunities to recuperate the costs associated with vaccine administration. Medicare U.S. Centers for M edicare and Medicaid Services has released guidance regarding administration of COVID -19 vaccines and how to conduct billing. EMS organizations that are enrolled in Medicare but are not generally permitted to bill for the administration of COVID -19 vaccines are able to enroll as a mass immunizer. Services in the State of Maine will need to contact National Government Services (NGS) in as the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) via phone in order to enroll. They can be contacted between the hours of 08:00 and 16:00 Central Time via (888) 802- 3898. You will need the following information during the call: Legal Business Name ; National Provider Identification Number (NPI) ; Tax Identification Number (TIN) ; State License Number, if applicable ; Location Information; and Contact Information (including, but not limited to, telephone number and email). When speaking with the MAC, they will screen your organization over the phone and establish temporary Medicare billing privileges. Official notification and authorization will be sent within 24 hours to the contact information on file. This step may be completed by your billing agency on your behalf as they likely integrate with National Government Services through the PC -ACE system or another software platform for Medicare claims. You will submit roster billing claims through their online portal. Medicare is paying the following rates for mass vaccinators and other individuals administering the vaccine: Page 28 of 40 Table 2 Vaccine Administration Payment Rates from Medicare VACCINE TYPE PAYMENT RATE18 SINGLE DOSE VACCINE $28.39 TWO -DOSE SERIES VACCINE (TOTAL) $45.33 INITIAL DOSE $16.94 FINAL DOSE $28.39 Note: In the case of two -dose series vaccines, the initial and final dose will be billed separately but totaling $45.33 at the completion of the series. For private payers and for Medicaid, we are working on building out capacity for roster billing with these organizations as well. We anticipate private insurers will honor these same rates as Medicare .19 It will be vital that those conducting the vaccines capture all necessary billing information in order to facilitate the billing processes. Medicaid Maine DHHS and Maine EMS are working through the process by which EMS agencies will be able to submit ro sters to MaineCare for roster billing. More information will be made available as soon as the pathway has been defined by the MaineCare team at Maine DHHS. Privately Insured Maine EMS is working closely with the Maine Bureau of Insurance to work through the details of roster billing with private insurers in the State of Maine. Maine EMS will provide the details by which EMS organizations can submit rosters to private insurers as soon as it becomes available. Maine EMS is building a custom export from the MEFIRS system that can be sent directly to each insurer for reimbursement. Details regarding this process for each payer will be made available as soon as it is finalized. Uninsured If an EMS organization administe rs the vaccine to a person who is uninsured , there is a pathway for reimbursement through the C oronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act via the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration. Using the following link , services can sign up to be able to submit claims for uninsured persons for vaccine administration costs. Services must attest that to their knowledge the individual is uninsure d and not eligible for Medicare or Medicaid benefits at the time.20 18 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

It will be important to consult with the organization's legal counsel and/or insurance carrier, if applicable, to ensure that vaccine administration is covered under the policy. It is important to note that there are dollar amount limitations in the State of Maine for civil suits against gov ernment entities and potentially their contractors. Please note that t his information does not constitute legal advice , it is important to consult with your legal counsel to better understand the potential , or lack thereof, for liability . COVID -19 vaccines , and subsequent adverse reactions, are covered countermeasures under the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP), not the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) authorizes th e CICP to provide benefits to certain individuals or estates of individuals who sustain a covered serious physical injury as the direct result of the administration or use of the covered countermeasures. The CICP can also provide benefits to certain surviv ors of individuals who die as a direct result of the administration or use of covered countermeasures identified in a PREP Act declaration. The PREP Act declaration for medical countermeasures against COVID - 19 states that the covered countermeasures are any antiviral medication, any other drug, any biologic, any diagnostic, any other device, or any vaccine used to treat, diagnose, cure, prevent, or mitigate COVID -19, the transmission of SARS- CoV-2 or a virus mutating from SARS- CoV-2, or any device used in t he administration of and all components and constituent materials of any such product. The CICP is administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Information about the CICP and filing a claim is available by calling 1 -855-266-2427 or visiting http://www.hrsa.gov/cicp/ . Participating clinicians should take note that none of these programs or rules provide any immunity or protections in the event of gross negligence by the clinician .
