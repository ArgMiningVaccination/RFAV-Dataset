Give thanks for the real-life heroes doing the essential work of keeping our hospitals and society running. Acknowledge the [sparks of good news](https://tanksgoodnews.com/) happening every day. One piece of wisdom we turn to again and again is a quote from one of our favorite people on Instagram, 4-year-old dancer [@bossbabybrody](https://www.instagram.com/bossbabybrody/).

No adult could have said it better! To help lift you up during this tough time, we're sharing some of our favorite crystals for a few common shelter-at-home hurdles. We hope that they can bring you a small bit of comfort and peace right now. "}
