These viruses are met with vaccines that are swiftly made by the World Health Organization. The problem with the way that vaccines are made is, the World Health Organization not only makes the vaccines but also deems the vaccines safe. Since they are responsible for making and deeming the vaccines safe, mistakes can lead to mass deaths. For this reason there should be checks and balances where other agencies test the vaccines for potential threat of mental illness, dangerous ingredients, and death. This system is definitely due for an complete overhaul due to the lives of the families that are affected. Although there is no scientific proof that vaccines cause autism, proponents still believe that they do. The theory that vaccines cause autism were based on unproven facts and falsified information (DeStefano 81). In an article called CNS Drugs, the author writes about how a man named AJ Wakefield stun the public with a theory that the MMR vaccine may cause autism and how enterocolitis (bowel dysfunction) and MMR vaccine may be linked to autism (DeStefano 831). Even though Wakefield falsified information and his theories were proven to be discredited many people still In order to investigate more about Wakefield's study, Brian Deer, a journalist of British Medical Journal, carefully talked to the parents of all children who were participated in the study. Interestingly enough, he revealed the fraud behind Wakefield's research. The Lancet, the journal that reported Wakefield's study, retracted the paper soon afterwards (Deer). However, the real trouble still exists. Though it has been proved by many researchers that the MRR doesn't cause autism, many people perceive the vaccine as a threat. Dr.Nemeroff once said \"it is quite difficult to get the cognitive sewage out of the water even after the real sewage is gone\" (Greene). Critical review on Wakefield's research paper Introduction Andrew Wakefield is a former gastroenterologist and medical researcher who was discharged from his medical register in the UK, because of his dishonest research paper he released back in 1998, that analysed a possible link between measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the presence of autism and bowel disease (Godlee, F., et al, 2011). Wakefield's research generated a substantial scare for the MMR vaccine and MMR vaccination rates began to drop because parents were concerned about the risk of autism after vaccination (DeStefano, F., Chen, R.T., 1999). After the paper was published by the Lancet medical newspaper, other reviews were trying to repeat Wakefield's conclusions, In 1998, the British medical journal called The Lancet published a controversial research paper written by Andrew Wakefield. In the research paper \"Ileal-lymphoid-nodular hyperplasia, non-specific colitis, and pervasive developmental disorder in children, \" Andrew Wakefield et al. attempted to link MMR (Mumps, Measles, Rubella) vaccinations and autism. Nevertheless, the paper seemed to successfully do that. However, this was not known was at the time was Wakefield had tampered with the findings. Furthermore, this was brought to light in 2004 by British journalist Brian Deer. In 2011, thirteen years after The Lancet published the paper, and seven years after Brian Deer exposed the paper. The Lancet finally retracted the article. A common theory The topic of childhood vaccinations and the dangers that accompany them has been a topic of controversy in contemporary times. At the near edge of the twenty-first century, a man named Doctor Andrew Wakefield released a study which created a mass uproar in both parents and health professionals alike. Parents This led to the support of various unproven vaccine-autism theories by parents in both the UK and America. After findings of intestinal disease in children with autism, Wakefield claimed that separating the MMR into three different vaccinations would be safer. Since then, Wakefield's research has been discredited, he was charged with serious professional misconduct by the General Medical Council for violating several ethical practices, and he was investigated for failing to disclose conflict of interest - a pending patent on a rival measles vaccine (Gross, 2009). Although false, many still believe wholeheartedly that vaccines are harmful. The down fall to these vaccinations are the side effects. Most of them are mild ones such as redness, soreness, or inflammation of the injection site. Some others may cause nausea, fever, or things on them lines, but the bottom line is that you're not going to get a much more serious disease that could Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) Vaccine and the Development of Autism Controversy Andrew Wakefield and other 12 co-authors published a study in the Lancet in 1998 that suggested a relationship between measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and autism. In other words, Wakefield and associates suggested that the vaccine for MMR could predispose children to autism. The paper received massive publicity despite the researchers having used a sample size that was not representative (n=12), the research design was uncontrolled as well as conclusions being speculative (Sathyanarayana Rao & Andrade, 2011). Consequently, the vaccines for MMR plummeted since parents feared that vaccinating their children against MMR could predispose their children to autism. \"In 2011 alone, 1.5 million children died [worldwide] from diseases preventable by currently recommended vaccines\" (\"Immunization\" 2). The magnitude of this tragedy is in part caused by the fact that some of those children simply weren't reached by organizations like UNICEF, which aim to vaccinate children (\"Immunization\" 2). However, Are the ingredients in vaccines safe for your child? Shane Ellison states that they are not, saying \"Formaldehyde is just one of the many chemicals found in vaccines. And according to the FDA 'excessive exposure to formaldehyde may cause cancer,'\" [22]. Other ingredients in vaccines that tend to put people off are [15] mercury, an element that is poisonous to the nervous system and can be toxic at levels above 0.32 microgram a day for newborn babies, and aluminum which in excess can cause neurological harm. Some vaccines also contain chicken egg protein which, for children who are allergic to egg can be potentially harmful. Such chemicals can be cause for concern for parents but are not as dangerous as they first appear. Presentation Rationale Purpose: The intended purpose of this presentation is to provide facts and scientific research that persuades the audience members regarding the use of vaccinations. My intention is that the audience will support the use of vaccinations and consider the facts before making decisions that affect the entire community. My central idea is that inaccurate data exists with regards to vaccination; instead, that vaccinations should be viewed as essential for protection of society, both from extreme illness as well as life threatening, and sometimes fatal, diseases. Abstract This paper examines the controversy surrounding the public health issue of vaccinations in children. Following a careful review of the literature surrounding this issue, the possible reasons for and implications of having a large percentage of the population who remains unvaccinated are discussed. Possible interventions and purposed interventions for resolution of this problem are discussed and conclusions are drawn based on what it learned from the literature. Mercury can also be found in the compound called thimerosal, which is used as a preservative for vaccines. Not long ago, when this information was introduced to the public, there was a scare which caused a decline in the amount of vaccines given to young children. To me, not vaccinating a child seems more dangerous than exposing the child to a trace amount of mercury. The article states how the FDA has been trying to ban the use of thimerosal, which they have been successful in doing in most drugs, besides the flu vaccine. The MMR Vaccine: Examining the Evidence In 1963 the Noble Peace Prize winning virologist John F. Enders finally licensed his vaccine for measles. Prior to this vaccine the United States alone reported 4 million cases of the measles each year. With more scientific discoveries the measles vaccine today has evolved "}
