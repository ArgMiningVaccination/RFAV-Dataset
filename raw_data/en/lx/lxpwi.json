She also found strength and solace in religion. \"Cancer transformed my life. It taught me the importance of loving and accepting myself and to take responsibility for my physical health and mental well-being,\" says Lee. It was during a routine health check-up in December 2016 that a lump was found in Lee's left breast that turned out to be malignant. She was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer. \"A colleague had been diagnosed with breast cancer, which prompted me to go for a check-up, something I had ignored for years. \"The diagnosis was a shock and I was in denial for a while. I was worried for my family, especially my kids,\" says Lee, who was 41 at the time of her diagnosis and the mother of two children, aged 13 and 11. At a private hospital, Lee had surgery to reconstruct her left breast but the cost exhausted her medical insurance cover. She received her follow-up chemotherapy and radiation therapy in a Hong Kong public hospital. \"I didn't have much knowledge about insurance,\" says Lee, who was fortunate to have bought critical illness insurance coverage just five months before her diagnosis.

I was worried that my insurance cover and my earnings would not be adequate to cover future medical outlay.\" A desire to be better informed and equipped on insurance protection choices, and to guide others who might also be in the same predicament with their coverage options, prompted a career change. Lee, who had worked at a publishing house and as an IT consultant before her diagnosis, joined the insurance industry. Lee also took charge of her health. \"Cancer made me realise the importance of being fit and having a healthy diet and lifestyle,\" says Lee, who began running in 2018 to become stronger. \"I started by running small distances. At first, I could barely run 100 metres at a time, but I slowly built up my stamina to run up to 8km (five miles).\" [protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein), [low-carbohydrate diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbohydrate_diet)) for almost three years and in 2020 took up intermittent fasting, an eating pattern where you cycle between periods of eating and fasting. Since her change in lifestyle, Lee has lost 17kg (37 pounds) and now weighs 61kg (134 pounds). \"Exercising and eating healthy made me feel lighter and stronger,\" says Lee, who also enrolled in an online course, 'Understanding Cancer Metastasis' from Johns Hopkins University, to be better informed about her condition. Lee also looked at alternative methods to help her boost her immunity. She took vitamin C therapy (administering high doses of vitamin C through intravenous methods) and hyperthermia treatment (a cancer treatment where certain parts of the body are heated up to temperatures of 50 degrees Celsius) at Hong Kong's LifeClinic, an integrative health and medical clinic, specialising in cancer care. \"Our goal is to improve the patient's experience in their fight against cancer and increase their odds of beating it. We incorporate holistic cancer treatments under one roof, guiding and supporting the patient through their journey,\" says Miles Price, functional medicine practitioner and clinical nutritionist at LifeClinic. \"Vitamin C helps form neurotransmitters and boosts the body's immune system. High temperatures can kill and damage cancer cells, usually with minimal injury to normal cells, and upregulate the immune response to cancer cells,\" says Price. \"A change in my diet and lifestyle, supplemented by the vitamin C and hyperthermia treatments helped. I felt my immunity increase and my tumour marker levels for cancer reduced drastically,\" says Lee. \"I knew that stress was a major contributing factor and that I had to find ways to think more positively,\" says Lee, who says that receiving support from her family and community, particularly from her church, was critical to her recovery. \"I was a non-believer before my cancer was detected. While undergoing chemotherapy in 2017, I started going to the church. I felt a sense of peace and found solace in the belief that there is a higher power that looks over me,\" says Lee, who regularly attends the New Life City Church in North Point. \"My new-found faith has enabled me to look at my situation in a positive way and the confidence that I can cope with whatever life has in store for me,\" she says.

In 2020, she started a YouTube channel, \"Love Myself, Love Living\", to share her cancer journey and the steps she took to heal herself. The channel has 60, 20-minute episodes (in Cantonese) chronicling her journey. \"I know first-hand how detrimental the effects of stress and an unhealthy lifestyle can be. I want to teach others the tools that helped me so they can avoid or better deal with a life-threatening illness,\" she says. Through her YouTube channel (it has almost 500 followers), Lee has reached out to several women diagnosed with breast cancer and is happiest when helping others.

Lee believes that mastering our health is in our own hands and that our body has the ability to heal itself with proper nutrition, exercise and rest. "}
