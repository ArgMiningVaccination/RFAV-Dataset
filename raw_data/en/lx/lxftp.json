Introduction: Although we can attribute many public health successes to vaccination, the future presents continued challenges. Despite advancement of medical technologies, diseases still remain for which researchers have been unable to find effective vaccines (such as HIV/AIDS, malaria etc.). Also, vaccines are disease specific and therefore lots of vaccines are required to prevent diseases as new bugs are concurrently emerging. Therefore this is the high time for a nation to encourage the traditional system of medicine which provides a potential mechanism for development of immunity in children. Ayurveda, the traditional system of medicine in India provides lots of Lehana drugs which are supposed to build up the immunity and strength in children. Material and Methods: Various Ayurveda classics and studies published in journals related to Ayurveda Lehana are reviewed and analyzed. Result: Analysis of classical references and various experimental studies shows that Ayurveda Lehana drugs possess immuno-modulatory, intellect promoting and nutritional properties. The purpose of Lehana is not only same as of modern vaccination to prevent disease but also building immunity, ensuring proper growth and development and improving overall health of the child. Conclusion: Lehana can be administered in all children as prophylactic as it acts at the level of nutrition, metabolism, growth and development, physical strength and immunity. isara solutions The word immunity means the state of protection from infectious disease. The immune system evolved as defense system to protect animals from invading microorganisms and malignant disorders. Immunology is a branch of biomedical science that covers the study of all aspects of the immune response in all organisms. The study of the molecular and cellular components that comprise the immune system, including their function and interaction, is the central science of immunology. Ayurvedic system of medicine not only deals with treating the diseases but also aims to prevention the disease. Vyadhikshamatva (Immunity) is described in Ayurveda and this concept is considered equivalent to immunity. Hence an attempt has been made to present Ayurvedic concepts of immunity and immunization in the pandemic situation of COVID-19. This pandemic has turned the world's attention to immune system. Ayurveda has been a trusted measure in the fight of against coronavirus. The extensive knowledge base of Ayurveda on preventive care derives from the concepts daily regimes and seasonal regimes that are the key to healthy life. International Journal of Ayurveda and Pharma Research 2021 Ayurveda Immune boosters (AIB) are Rasayana drugs which increase the number of white blood cells and train them to fight against microbes causing diseases Some of them kill microorganisms, increase immunoglobulin, repair of DNA of an inflamed cell, increase Agni, and conditioning the gut to increase the beneficial gut microbiota This review aimed to generate scientific evidence for Ayurveda Immune boosters (AIB) are effective to prevent and cure COVID-19 infection or it is a myth through Ayurveda and modern literature review The properties of Rasayan are reviewed from Ayurveda Literature The immunopharmacology, mechanism of immuno-booster and Rasayana herbs are reviewed from current medical literature for its subclinical and clinical evidence Ayush kwatha and single herb (500-1000mg) extract, Aswagandha powder (3-5gm), and Haridra milk/gargling recommended as AIB by the Ministry AYUSH are safe and effective for prevention and cure of COVID-19 with sufficient preclinical... Journal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine Childhood is considered as the most important phase in life, which determines the quality of health, well being, learning and behaviour across the lifespan. This may be the reason for giving the foremost position for Balacikitsa among Ashtangas (8 branches) of Ayurveda. The regional growth of indigenous medicine gave significant contribution for the development of primary health care. Kerala has major contribution of many authentic textbooks of Balacikitsa like Arogyakalpadruma, Vaidya Tarakam etc. These are more practically oriented and it can be considered as a physician's quick reference hand book. Many new diseases which are not mentioned in classical textbooks have found their place in these books. Medications like Praakaara yoga, Uramarunnuprayoga were administered in children as a mode of immunization, which helps in the maintenance of health and prevention of disease. Many diseases like Karappan (balavisarpa), Shakarogas etc. were common in Kerala and various indigenous ... Journal of Ayurveda Medical Sciences 2021 JOURNAL OF HEALTH SCIENCE 2009 International Journal of Research in Ayurveda and Pharmacy Ayurveda is not simply a medical science but a life science, which has majorly described various fundamental principles that help Ayurveda education and research in India that can be further reinforced with innovative and creative motivations. Strategies and futuristic plans are considered essential to be implemented with active initiation by concerned Government bodies for creating awareness among the faculties, students and upcoming scholars of Ayurveda. Children are more susceptible to many diseases due to their transitional immune system. Good health is associated with reduced dropout and massive education performance and productivity. Children are sensitive to the diseases like malnutrition, infectious diseases, intestinal parasites, skin diseases, eye and ear, and dental caries. Ayurveda describes Dinacharya, Rutucharya, and a copious number of the preparation for the prevention and management of these diseases, which helps in bette... India is the land of traditions and religious beliefs that stand proudly next to the global technology. The great sages of India chanted shantih mantra and its echoes have reverberated through centuries. The quest for happiness and success has been the dynamic factor in the course of evolutionary history. It is reflected in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, which conveys that \"May all be free from illness/ disease\" which speaks about Universal health. Ayurveda advocates several non-pharmacological measures that are critical to overall health, including diet, sleep, mental factors, and environmental hygiene. There is a need to decode some of the non pharmacological, prophylactic measures that might sound superstitious to many, but are age-old practices of our ancestors and widely followed. This paper highlights prophylaxis aspects practiced traditionally in different parts of India along with Ayurvedic views and rationale behind these practices. Many age-old practices widely followed by our ancestors to prevent infectious diseases like daily regimens, seasonal regimens, personal hygiene, environmental hygiene, dietary guidelines, immunity boosting measures are relevant even today.
