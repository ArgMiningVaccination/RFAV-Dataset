Recent progress highlights the link between ASD and (i) immunogenetics, neurodevelopment, and inflammation, and (ii) impairments of autophagy, a crucial neurodevelopmental process involved in synaptic pruning. Among various environmental factors causing risk for ASD, aluminum (Al)-containing vaccines injected during critical periods have received special attention and triggered relevant scientific questions. The aim of this review is to discuss the current knowledge on the role of early inflammation, immune and autophagy dysfunction in ASD as well as preclinical studies which question Al adjuvant impacts on brain and immune maturation. We highlight the most recent breakthroughs and the lack of epidemiological, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data constituting a \"scientific gap\". We propose additional research, such as genetic studies that could contribute to identify populations at genetic risk, improving diagnosis, and potentially the development of new therapeutic tools.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-08-31", "cleaned_text": "Inflammation and Autophagy: A Convergent Point between Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)-Related Genetic and Environmental Factors: Focus on Aluminum Adjuvants [https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics10090518](https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics10090518) [Early Life Exposure to Persistent Organic Pollutants, a cellular mechanisms that mediate immunity-related neurodevelopmental alterations are gradually coming to light [ [13](#B13-toxics-10-00518)]. [14](#B14-toxics-10-00518), [15](#B15-toxics-10-00518)] have become standard practice, integrating both genetic and environmental factors potentially contributing to the vulnerability of developing these disorders. Preclinical \"multiple hit\" studies\u2014such as successive perinatal immune activations\u2014have already confirmed the increased risk to progeny and largely contributed to unraveling the molecular and cellular mechanisms that mediate immunity-induced brain alterations during development [ [16](#B16-toxics-10-00518), [17](#B17-toxics-10-00518)]. Another similar model considered the genetic background as the first hit: the individual's genetic factors interact with the early-life exposome (including persistent organic pollutants), which can be considered by itself a second hit [ [18](#B18-toxics-10-00518)]. These two hits combine to form a dormant phenotype that could likely be codified in the epigenome and is vulnerable to a third environmental hit later in life [ [18](#B18-toxics-10-00518)]. [19](#B19-toxics-10-00518)]. Primed glial cells maintain a more active-like morphology (e.g., amoeboid or reactive) in reaction to a baseline stimulus, such as infection, trauma, or aging. However, compared to acutely activated glia, primed cells do not release cytokines and other pro-inflammatory molecules on a long-term basis. Instead, when confronted with a challenge, primed cells generate more cytokines in the brain than unprimed cells [ [20](#B20-toxics-10-00518)]. [21](#B21-toxics-10-00518), [22](#B22-toxics-10-00518), [23](#B23-toxics-10-00518), [24](#B24-toxics-10-00518)]. Of note, the epidemiological studies evaluating any links between vaccination and NDDs did not specifically address Al adjuvant exposure, since most of them focused on Al-free vaccines (measles, mumps and rubella, MMR) The increased use of Al adjuvants in vaccines administered before the age of 12 months and the growing evidence of the potential neurotoxicity of Al adjuvants found so far lead us to recall the evolution of Al-containing vaccines. We review pre-clinical and clinical studies questioning their role in neuro-immune interactions during brain development in the context of ASD. Indeed, ASD persistently ranks at the top of NDDs with regard to the relative genetic contribution, including epigenetic and gene-environment (GxE) interactions [ [28](#B28-toxics-10-00518)]. 2. Autism Spectrum Disorder 2.1. Definition and Prevalence [29](#B29-toxics-10-00518), [30](#B30-toxics-10-00518)]. In children under the age of five, ASD is the leading cause of disability [ [31](#B31-toxics-10-00518)]. Boys are three to four times more prone than girls to developing ASD [ [32](#B32-toxics-10-00518), [33](#B33-toxics-10-00518)]. [34](#B34-toxics-10-00518), [35](#B35-toxics-10-00518)]. More specifically, based on the most recent available statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), tracking for this since 1996, ASD in the United States affects 1 child in 44 (2021 figure for the year 2018) [ [36](#B36-toxics-10-00518)], while the prevalence of ASD in Europe varies from 0.44% to 1.97% of children aged 7-9 years old (i.e., from 1 in 51 children to 1 in 227 children), with an average calculated prevalence of 1.22% (i.e., 1 in 89 children) [ [37](#B37-toxics-10-00518)]. In Asia, a meta-analysis of published data found that the pooled calculated ASD prevalence is growing, calculated at 0.36% (i.e., 1 in 278 children) [ [38](#B38-toxics-10-00518)]. [39](#B39-toxics-10-00518)]. Indeed, current U.S. data are more than three times higher than the first prevalence estimation of 1 in 150 children between 2000 and 2002 [ [36](#B36-toxics-10-00518)]. This increase is not fully explained by the evolution of diagnostic criteria, and the age at which children are diagnosed with ASD remains unchanged, at around 50 months [ [39](#B39-toxics-10-00518)]; the increase is rather in favor of a role played by environmental risk factors [ [33](#B33-toxics-10-00518), [37](#B37-toxics-10-00518)]. 2.2. Genetics [28](#B28-toxics-10-00518), [40](#B40-toxics-10-00518)]. 2.3. Immune Dysfunction [41](#B41-toxics-10-00518), [42](#B42-toxics-10-00518), [43](#B43-toxics-10-00518)], raising the potential contribution of early immunological activation [ [44](#B44-toxics-10-00518)]. Immune compounds such as cytokines and chemokines and the cells that produce them in the central nervous system (CNS), particularly microglia, are known to have an important function in normal brain maturation [ [19](#B19-toxics-10-00518)]. Furthermore, a causal link is demonstrated between ASD and increased cellular production of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) [ [45](#B45-toxics-10-00518), [46](#B46-toxics-10-00518)] and IL-17 [ [47](#B47-toxics-10-00518), immune activation. Increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid of ASD patients as well as neuroinflammation in post-mortem brain from ASD individuals were also described [ [45](#B45-toxics-10-00518)]. In this context, a subset of 35 adult patients with high-functioning ASD present a chronic natural killer cell inflammatory/activation process, suggestive of cellular hyperactivation [ [50](#B50-toxics-10-00518)]. In of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and IL-18) have been described in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of ASD children compared to controls [ [51](#B51-toxics-10-00518)]. [52](#B52-toxics-10-00518)]. In addition, rodent studies demonstrated that immune dysfunction, including central and peripheral inflammation during perinatal periods (neuroinflammation, increased production of inflammatory cytokines or antibodies, immune cell activation and autoimmunity), impacts the neurodevelopmental trajectory of key circuits in both clinical and preclinical studies highlighted the implication of the complement system\u2014a key player in innate immunity\u2014in NDDs, including ASD [ [12](#B12-toxics-10-00518), [61](#B61-toxics-10-00518)]. As a result, a new paradigm has emerged in the field of \"immuno-neuropsychiatry\", describing a persistent immunological dysregulation in the pathogenesis of a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders (for a review, see [ [62](#B62-toxics-10-00518)]). 2.4. Immune System and Environment: A Convergent Point [63](#B63-toxics-10-00518)]. The immune system is our connection with the outside world and, as a result, environmental influences that affect the maternal, fetal, and/or neonatal immune pathways could cause distinct neuroimmune alterations in the developing individual [ [19](#B19-toxics-10-00518)]. Immune system activation resulting from exposure to pro-inflammatory external compounds during critical periods could cause permanent effects and increase the risk of NDDs, suggesting that inflammation itself represents an early environmental stressor [ [64](#B64-toxics-10-00518)]. 3. Autophagy [65](#B65-toxics-10-00518)], it preserves cellular homeostasis in conditions of environmental stress. Moreover, it controls the disposal of intracellular pathogens and promotes adaptive immunity [ [66](#B66-toxics-10-00518)]. The three main forms (microautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy, and macroautophagy) [ [65](#B65-toxics-10-00518)] and their dysregulation have been widely described in a broad spectrum of human diseases, along with inflammatory abnormalities (for a review, see [ [67](#B67-toxics-10-00518)]). Indeed, autophagy is essential for the genesis and progression of inflammation and immune response [ [68](#B68-toxics-10-00518), [69](#B69-toxics-10-00518)], both regulating one another in a bidirectional essential for early synaptic pruning, the developmental process whereby over 70% of postnatal net spines are eliminated during the normal course of brain maturation to ensure the relevant formation of appropriate neuronal connections [ [74](#B74-toxics-10-00518), [75](#B75-toxics-10-00518), [76](#B76-toxics-10-00518)]. Local regulation of autophagy is also crucial for proper axon guidance, vesicular and neurotransmitter release, dendritic spine structure, spine pruning, synaptic plasticity, and behavioral outputs of neural networks [ [74](#B74-toxics-10-00518)]. When impaired, neuronal autophagy has been linked to distinct brain alterations, particularly neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and neurodevelopmental [77](#B77-toxics-10-00518), [78](#B78-toxics-10-00518)]. [79](#B79-toxics-10-00518)]. Autophagy is a the polarization of macrophages and microglia [ [80](#B80-toxics-10-00518)] and regulating the level of activation in microglia [ [70](#B70-toxics-10-00518), [79](#B79-toxics-10-00518)]. In fact, microglial autophagy can be either pro- or anti-inflammatory, e.g., by reducing NLRP3 inflammatory components [ [70](#B70-toxics-10-00518), [72](#B72-toxics-10-00518)]. Moreover, the interaction between microglial inflammatory reaction and microglial autophagy is involved in both acute and chronic CNS injuries [ [70](#B70-toxics-10-00518)]. [81](#B81-toxics-10-00518)]. Furthermore, in a special context of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis model, modifying macrophages at the periphery has the capacity to change microglial inflammatory reactivity and to modulate the synaptogenesis signaling pathway by microglia [ [82](#B82-toxics-10-00518)]. 3.2. Autophagy Disruption and ASD [74](#B74-toxics-10-00518)]. Another observation is the implication of functionally relevant polymorphisms in autophagy-associated genes in the vulnerability to autoimmune and inflammatory disorders known to be associated with ASD [ [83](#B83-toxics-10-00518), [84](#B84-toxics-10-00518)]. [76](#B76-toxics-10-00518)]. These endophenotypes resemble the \"intense world syndrome\" describing the autistic brain as hyper-reactive with a hyper-connectivity of local neural circuits. Such complex connections are characterized by exaggerated neural information processing and storage within the brain microcircuits, caused by a higher number of synaptic connections and increased spine density [ [76](#B76-toxics-10-00518), [85](#B85-toxics-10-00518)]. [86](#B86-toxics-10-00518)]. [87](#B87-toxics-10-00518)]. Indeed, rapamycin also rescued altered gene expression, highlighting the role of autophagy and the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in ASD, suggesting the interest in new therapeutic targets involving autophagy modulation [ effect by modulating neural autophagy and by acting on the mTOR pathway in other cells of the neurovascular unit related to the BBB [ [95](#B95-toxics-10-00518)]. Furthermore, in BBB endothelium infections produced by Streptococcus B, autophagy could operate as a BBB cell defense strategy in response to invasive and toxin-producing bacteria [ [96](#B96-toxics-10-00518)]. It has been shown that BBB function is restored in mice by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome and inducing autophagy at the same time [ [97](#B97-toxics-10-00518)]. [98](#B98-toxics-10-00518)]. 3.4. Autophagy and Microbiota [99](#B99-toxics-10-00518)]. These recent data are particularly interesting considering that (i) the gut microbiota influences brain function through the neuroendocrine, neuroimmune, and autonomic nervous systems and via microbiotic toxin production, and (ii) both gut microbiota and inflammation could have a key role in the pathophysiology of NDDs [ [100](#B100-toxics-10-00518), [101](#B101-toxics-10-00518), [102](#B102-toxics-10-00518)]. 4. Al Adjuvants as Potential Vaccinal Policy, Safety, and Al-Based Adjuvants [103](#B103-toxics-10-00518), [104](#B104-toxics-10-00518)]. Although traditional vaccines are widely used and tolerated by a vast majority of people, vaccine safety in specific groups of the population has been a matter of concern for the past 50 years, particularly those including ABAs [ [23](#B23-toxics-10-00518), [105](#B105-toxics-10-00518), [106](#B106-toxics-10-00518), [107](#B107-toxics-10-00518), [108](#B108-toxics-10-00518)]. We cite in the following sections different studies indicating potential problems from a historical point of view. [109](#B109-toxics-10-00518)]. In human vaccines, three Al salts are now used as adjuvants: Al oxyhydroxide (Alhydrogel\u00ae), Al hydroxyphosphate (AdjuPhos\u00ae), and Al hydroxyphosphate sulfate. These salts are found in approximately 60% of human vaccines [ [106](#B106-toxics-10-00518)], and in France, they are included (alone or mixed) in 8 of the 11 mandatory children's vaccines [ [110](#B110-toxics-10-00518)]. [Figure 1](#toxics-10-00518-f001)) [ [111](#B111-toxics-10-00518), [112](#B112-toxics-10-00518)]. Alternatively, Al hydroxyphosphate is amorphous and has a slightly negative charge [ [111](#B111-toxics-10-00518)] (for a review, see [ [106](#B106-toxics-10-00518)]). The different physico-chemical characteristics of these two adjuvants (shape, size, and charge) can strongly influence their biodisposition kinetics\u2014Al oxyhydroxide is less solubilized, more absorbed, and produces a lower toxicity to phagocytic cells than Al hydroxyphosphate [ [111](#B111-toxics-10-00518)]\u2014as well as their cellular effects. The rate of aggregation can vary according to these properties and their biochemical environment [ [112](#B112-toxics-10-00518), [113](#B113-toxics-10-00518)]. Consequently, the size of the injected particles modifies their cellular uptake by immune cells and the induced cytotoxicity [ [111](#B111-toxics-10-00518), [114](#B114-toxics-10-00518)] or even affects their ability to translocate in the body. [115](#B115-toxics-10-00518), [116](#B116-toxics-10-00518), [117](#B117-toxics-10-00518)]. In the 1990s, the first indications of potential post-immunization development of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a multifactorial and poorly understood disabling disease, emerged in Canada following the first campaign of immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV) with Al-adjuvanted vaccines [ [106](#B106-toxics-10-00518), [118](#B118-toxics-10-00518), [119](#B119-toxics-10-00518)]. Meanwhile, insights came from the Gulf War Illness, pointing out a link between ME/CFS and multiple vaccine administrations within a short period of time, when comparing vaccinated versus non-vaccinated veterans [ [120](#B120-toxics-10-00518), [121](#B121-toxics-10-00518)]. [21](#B21-toxics-10-00518), [122](#B122-toxics-10-00518), [123](#B123-toxics-10-00518)]. Interestingly, a persistency of Al oxyhydroxide particles within immune cells occurred in both adults and children [ [21](#B21-toxics-10-00518)], questioning the kinetics of these compounds in Al was suspected to be a cofactor in a variety of chronic disorders [ [134](#B134-toxics-10-00518)]. In addition, Al neurotoxicity was reported in 1997 in preterm infants, showing that prolonged intravenous feeding with soluble Al-containing solutions leads to neurological development impairments [ [135](#B135-toxics-10-00518)]. These studies addressed only soluble Al compounds (mainly present in food or in drinking water), yet they contributed to a general concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the French National Academy of Pharmacy concerning ABAs' potential toxicity and the need for further research on Al adjuvants' pharmacokinetics and safety [ Vaccines [132](#B132-toxics-10-00518), [133](#B133-toxics-10-00518), much information is available regarding ABAs. Indeed, pharmacokinetic data from in vivo as well as mathematical models, useful to predict Al concentrations in plasma and tissue after vaccination in children and adults, are missing, and this constitutes a \"scientific gap\" [ [140](#B140-toxics-10-00518), [141](#B141-toxics-10-00518)]. Moreover, any attempt to extrapolate ABAs' fate from soluble Al data is misleading since the frequency of exposure, the route of administration, and the form of Al are different [ [132](#B132-toxics-10-00518)]. In particular, (i) when injected intramuscularly, Al oxyhydroxide is assimilated at nearly 100% efficacy over time, whereas dietary absorption is less than 1% [ [107](#B107-toxics-10-00518), [142](#B142-toxics-10-00518)], and (ii) the adjuvant essentially remains immune cell-bound after injection. Indeed, it was shown that instead of fast elimination through urine (as previously claimed) [ [143](#B143-toxics-10-00518)], Al oxyhydroxide is subjected to remarkable retention within the body [ [144](#B144-toxics-10-00518)]. Al oxyhydroxide nanoparticles spontaneously form aggregates which after injection are promptly engulfed, remaining within phagocytic cells for long periods in both humans and animals [ [21](#B21-toxics-10-00518), [145](#B145-toxics-10-00518)]. Furthermore, Al particles can migrate, through monocyte/macrophage cells, from the injection site to distant organs [ [106](#B106-toxics-10-00518), [123](#B123-toxics-10-00518), [145](#B145-toxics-10-00518), [146](#B146-toxics-10-00518), [147](#B147-toxics-10-00518), [148](#B148-toxics-10-00518)]. [149](#B149-toxics-10-00518)], without providing results from potential safety protocols. In addition, the simultaneous administration of several Al-containing vaccines was not considered, nor were post-injection kinetics or toxicity levels [ [150](#B150-toxics-10-00518)]. Finally, as mentioned above, the argument stating that doses of ABAs are low compared to Al daily dietary exposure is worthless, considering the early, acute, and repeated exposure to vaccines [ [150](#B150-toxics-10-00518), [151](#B151-toxics-10-00518)] and the different pharmacokinetic properties of soluble versus particulate Al. [110](#B110-toxics-10-00518), [151](#B151-toxics-10-00518), [152](#B152-toxics-10-00518), [153](#B153-toxics-10-00518)]. In the United States, the first injection with the hepatitis B vaccine may occur on the first day of life [ [153](#B153-toxics-10-00518)], reaching at least thirteen Al-containing vaccine injections by the age of 18 months (i.e., a total dose of almost 3 to 4 mg Al/infant) [ [154](#B154-toxics-10-00518)]. Our recent study focusing on the 2018 French vaccination schedule showed that (i) half of the exposure occurs before 1 year of age; (ii) an adult following vaccination requirements and recommendations receives between 2.5 and 7.7 mg of Al3+ during his/her lifetime; (iii) exposure varies according to age, weight, sex, and selection of one vaccine among several for the same valence [ [110](#B110-toxics-10-00518)]. From the end of the 1990s, an increase of 25% to Al exposure through vaccination from birth to 18 months of age has been reported [ [154](#B154-toxics-10-00518)]. [155](#B155-toxics-10-00518)]. [123](#B123-toxics-10-00518), [145](#B145-toxics-10-00518), [146](#B146-toxics-10-00518), [147](#B147-toxics-10-00518)]. induce immunoinflammatory responses in neural tissues: this translocation has been observed in animals exposed to ABAs, Al-containing vaccines, or ABA-trackers These findings prompted Khan et al. to conclude that repetitive doses of Al oxyhydroxide are \"insidiously unsafe\", particularly when given to newborns with an immature BBB. In addition, ABA removal from the CNS is considered to be nearly can leave the injection area to reach remote organs such as the nervous system [ [146](#B146-toxics-10-00518), [157](#B157-toxics-10-00518), [163](#B163-toxics-10-00518), [164](#B164-toxics-10-00518), [173](#B173-toxics-10-00518), six evaluated perinatal period exposure: two studies on gestational exposure on rats [ [181](#B181-toxics-10-00518), [182](#B182-toxics-10-00518)], three studies on newborn mice [ [163](#B163-toxics-10-00518), [167](#B167-toxics-10-00518), [169](#B169-toxics-10-00518)], and one on newborn rats [ [183](#B183-toxics-10-00518)] (for a review, see [ [148](#B148-toxics-10-00518)]). 4.3. Biological Effects of ABAs on the Immune System [184](#B184-toxics-10-00518), [185](#B185-toxics-10-00518)]. In vitro studies have shown that these adjuvants are able to slowly release the antigen in which they are adsorbed and therefore promote the immune response in the presence of even poorly immunogenic antigens [ [186](#B186-toxics-10-00518)]. At early stages, ABAs are also capable of stimulating the differentiation of monocytes into dendritic cells [ [187](#B187-toxics-10-00518)] and enhancing antigen uptake by antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells and macrophages, resulting in antigen phagocytosis [ [188](#B188-toxics-10-00518)]. They also have the ability to activate the inflammasome pathway [ [189](#B189-toxics-10-00518), [190](#B190-toxics-10-00518)], leading to the release of mature IL-1 and IL-18 by dendritic cells and to the differentiation of T helper 2 (Th2) cells, thus stimulating B cell activation and antibody release, possibly in response to the oxidative stress induced by Al [ [192](#B192-toxics-10-00518), [199](#B199-toxics-10-00518)]. [200](#B200-toxics-10-00518), [203](#B203-toxics-10-00518)] and favoring Th2 immune responses [ [204](#B204-toxics-10-00518)]. Interestingly, inflammation is elicited by Al oxyhydroxide particles by triggering the NALP3 inflammasome [ [205](#B205-toxics-10-00518)]. The main characteristic of this activation process is the release of IL-1, which was detected in both brain immune cells and neurons loaded with Al oxyhydroxide particles in mouse experiments [ [146](#B146-toxics-10-00518)]. [206](#B206-toxics-10-00518)]). Microglial activation\u2014suggesting an ongoing inflammatory process\u2014was observed 6 months after intra-muscular injection of Al oxyhydroxide adjuvant in adult mice ( [Figure 2](#toxics-10-00518-f002)) [ [164](#B164-toxics-10-00518)]. Furthermore, neonatal injection of an Al oxyhydroxide-containing HBV vaccine provokes a Th2 immune reaction in the periphery, while raising IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-) opposite effect [ [193](#B193-toxics-10-00518)]. Al-containing hepatitis B injection during the first three weeks of life induces a proinflammatory profile of cytokine expression in the hippocampus [ [207](#B207-toxics-10-00518)], whereas in the periphery, it causes increased IL-4 levels and decreased proinflammatory cytokines [ [208](#B208-toxics-10-00518)]. [183](#B183-toxics-10-00518)]. Moreover, the impact of gender and genetic background on cytokine and chemokine reactions, along with astrogliosis and microgliosis in the brain, is highlighted in this study. 4.4. Autophagy Modulation by Al Particles [66](#B66-toxics-10-00518), [209](#B209-toxics-10-00518)]. In mouse and zebrafish studies, exposure to Al nanoparticles leads to alterations in the expression of autophagy-related proteins, associated with behavioral impairment, sometimes in a particle size-dependent manner [ [210](#B210-toxics-10-00518), [211](#B211-toxics-10-00518)]. Like other metals, nanomaterials, and metallic nanomaterials, ABAs exert some inhibitory effects on destabilization [ [205](#B205-toxics-10-00518), [212](#B212-toxics-10-00518), [213](#B213-toxics-10-00518), [214](#B214-toxics-10-00518)]. Biopersistence of Al could be related to its lysosome-destabilizing action, which could be caused by direct crystal-induced fracture of phagolysosomal membranes [ [123](#B123-toxics-10-00518), [205](#B205-toxics-10-00518), [214](#B214-toxics-10-00518)]. Once particles are transferred within double-membrane autophagosomes and then fused with reconstructed and re-acidified lysosomes, Al is exposed to lysosomal acid pH, being the only condition capable of dissolving Al particles [ [123](#B123-toxics-10-00518)]. [21](#B21-toxics-10-00518), [89](#B89-toxics-10-00518), [215](#B215-toxics-10-00518)]. The phagophore's recruitment of the cytosolic light chain protein 3 (LC3) results in the formation of an autophagosome, a vesicular double membrane that engulfs ingested particles as and Cerebral translocation of Al particles is significantly increased in mice with a chronically altered BBB [ [146](#B146-toxics-10-00518)]. Furthermore, it was shown in mice that nanoalumina particle exposure through the carotid artery could lead to (i) particle deposition in brain endothelial cells and accumulation in brain, (ii) increased autophagy-associated gene expression and autophagic activity in the brain, (iii) decreased tight junction protein expression, and (iv) increased BBB permeability, suggesting that autophagy is a key mechanism in nanoalumina-mediated neurovascular toxic effects within the CNS [ [221](#B221-toxics-10-00518)]. 4.6. ABAs and ASD: What Are the Facts? [206](#B206-toxics-10-00518)]. Several studies have thus proposed that ABA exposure may be insidiously harmful for certain children over the short and long term, contributing to the tremendous increase in NDDs, especially ASD, at a young see [ [226](#B226-toxics-10-00518)]). The main arguments in favor of this hypothesis are the following observations: [227](#B227-toxics-10-00518)] described that the increased exposure to ABAs correlated with increased ASD incidence in the United States, and that the quantity of Al provided at 3-4 months of age was associated with ASD incidence in seven Western countries. In addition, postponing the first hepatitis B vaccination from the neonate stage (1st month of life) could reduce the incidence of ASD diagnosis in males by three times [ [228](#B228-toxics-10-00518)]. Because the infants in this study were born before the removal of mercury from vaccines, doubts persist about the particular impact of early mercury, Al, or the combination of mercury and Al exposure in ASD. [224](#B224-toxics-10-00518)] used transversely graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy to determine the Al concentration in post-mortem ASD brain tissue. Means from 2.30 to 8.74 g Al3+/g were encountered, representing some of the highest values for Al in human brain tissue yet recorded. Moreover, this study also revealed Al intracellular localization in microglia-like cells and other inflammatory non-neuronal cells in the meninges, vasculature, gray, and white matter ( [Figure 3](#toxics-10-00518-f003)) [ [224](#B224-toxics-10-00518)]. Such observations can only be made post-mortem and do not allow the identification of the precise environmental origin of Al. However, they provide clues on shared cellular mechanisms - such as immune excitotoxicity - between neuronal Al content and ASD. [41](#B41-toxics-10-00518), [42](#B42-toxics-10-00518), [43](#B43-toxics-10-00518)]. These immune reactions can be caused by a toxic effect on the immune system during development or by an early intense (and/or repeated) stimulation of it. Mouse model studies during the early stages of postnatal development showed that Al adjuvants can adversely impact social behavior [ [163](#B163-toxics-10-00518), [167](#B167-toxics-10-00518), [169](#B169-toxics-10-00518)]. It was recently reported that intraperitoneal injection of hepatitis B vaccine during the first three weeks of age interfered with the developing mouse brain (impaired behavior, hippocampal long-term potentiation, decreased neurogenesis, microglial activation, and proinflammatory profile of cytokine expression in the hippocampus), probably mediated by IL-4 [ [207](#B207-toxics-10-00518), [208](#B208-toxics-10-00518)]. In addition, an adult sheep model also demonstrated that following repetitive shots of ABAs or ABA-containing vaccines, animals exhibited abnormal behaviors, such as increased aggressiveness and stereotypies, and decreased affiliative social interaction [ [168](#B168-toxics-10-00518)]. Furthermore, the reported increased levels of IL-6 in the blood and brains of rodents exposed to ABAs [ [183](#B183-toxics-10-00518), [193](#B193-toxics-10-00518), [194](#B194-toxics-10-00518)] are of particular interest due to the role of this interleukin as an important mediator of autism-like behaviors [ [60](#B60-toxics-10-00518)]. [226](#B226-toxics-10-00518)], new hypotheses regarding neurological and immunological consequences of ABA-containing vaccines and novel clinical strategies (i.e., postponing of ABA-containing vaccines and replacement of ABAs with calcium phosphate are now being considered [ [225](#B225-toxics-10-00518), [229](#B229-toxics-10-00518)]. (Calcium phosphate was used in France until the mid-1980s mainly for the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine group, without any mention of adverse reactions by physicians. Until the early-1970s it was also successfully used in pentavalent human vaccinations (smallpox, yellow fever, measles, BCG, and tetanus), also without any reported adverse reactions [ [230](#B230-toxics-10-00518)]. For a review on calcium phosphate, see [ [231](#B231-toxics-10-00518)]). [232](#B232-toxics-10-00518), [233](#B233-toxics-10-00518), [234](#B234-toxics-10-00518)]. Five pertussis vaccines are currently available, all with ABAs (Al oxyhydroxide, Al phosphate, or a mix of both) [ [234](#B234-toxics-10-00518), [235](#B235-toxics-10-00518)]. With regard to ABA neurodevelopmental toxicity discussed in this review, this prenatal exposure raises questions in addition to the previously discussed maternal immune activation model, related to (1) the very low number of studies focusing on prenatal exposure to ABAs (to our knowledge, so far only two studies on rats prenatally exposed to Al-containing HPV vaccine or to the adjuvant Al hydroxyphosphate sulfate have been performed until now, both by the vaccine industry [ [181](#B181-toxics-10-00518), [182](#B182-toxics-10-00518)]); moreover, (2) placental transfer to fetus tissues (including the brain) of Al compounds, in both humans and animals, was described [ [236](#B236-toxics-10-00518), [237](#B237-toxics-10-00518), [238](#B238-toxics-10-00518), [239](#B239-toxics-10-00518)], whereas there are no clinical data available addressing this question specifically for ABAs. [240](#B240-toxics-10-00518), [241](#B241-toxics-10-00518)], including: - Epidemiological studies comparing different vaccination schedules and ABA exposure in children; - Genetic studies of populations at risk, potentially targeting candidate genes in immune and autophagy pathways; - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Al adjuvants during both pre- and postnatal periods, in animal models; - Fundamental immunological data in order to better understand the mechanisms of immune action of ABAs, in addition to their possible capacity of inducing neuroinflammation and alterations of immune-neural interactions during early postnatal life, e.g., using autophagy-deficient mouse models. 5.
