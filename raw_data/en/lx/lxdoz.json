Sotrovimab is recommended if nirmatrelvir plus ritonavir (Paxlovid) is not suitable. Some treatments come as capsules or tablets that you swallow. Others are given to you through a drip in your arm (infusion), usually in a hospital or local health centre. These treatments can help some people manage their COVID-19 symptoms and reduce the risk of becoming seriously ill. You'll be told which treatment, if any, is most suitable for you. If you need to go into hospital for COVID-19, you may get other treatments. How to get COVID-19 treatment Local NHS organisations are responsible for arranging COVID-19 treatments. The way you get treatment may depend on where you live. Your [local integrated care board (ICB)](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/find-your-local-integrated-care-board/) can give you more information. If you think you're in the highest risk group and need to access COVID-19 treatment, but do not have information from your local NHS organisation, follow these steps to be considered for a referral. 1. Take a rapid lateral flow test if you get symptoms If you have any [symptoms of COVID-19](/conditions/covid-19/covid-19-symptoms-and-what-to-do/), take a rapid lateral flow test as soon as possible, even if your symptoms are mild. Only take a test if you have symptoms. If you're eligible for COVID-19 treatment, you should keep rapid lateral flow tests at home. You can order free NHS rapid lateral flow test kits on GOV.UK or by calling NHS 119. You can also use tests you've paid for, for example, a test you've bought from a supermarket or pharmacy. 2. If your test is positive, call your GP surgery, NHS 111 or hospital specialist Call your GP surgery, NHS 111 or hospital specialist as soon as possible if your test result is positive. They'll decide if you need referring for an assessment for COVID-19 treatment. They may ask what other medicines you take or receive, including any vitamins and minerals, so it's important to have a list of these ready. If you're eligible for treatment, it's important to start the treatment as soon as you can. Treatments for COVID-19 need to be given quickly after your symptoms start to be effective. The medicine can be collected on your behalf by someone else, such as a friend or relative. Alternatively, the NHS may be able to arrange for the medicine to be delivered to you. If the treatment needs to be given as a drip in your arm (infusion), you'll usually get it at your local hospital or in a local health centre. You'll get instructions on where to get the treatment and how to get there and back safely. 3. If your test is negative, do a total of 3 tests over 3 days If your test result is negative, but you still have symptoms of COVID-19, you need to do a total of 3 rapid lateral flow tests over 3 days. For example, if you did your first test today, you should do a 2nd test tomorrow and a 3rd test the day after.
