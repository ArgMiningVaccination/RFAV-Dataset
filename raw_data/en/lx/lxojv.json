Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease April 17, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2020.101663 Purpose To determine if a hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination provides an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients and can decrease virus carriage. Study design Non-controlled, non-comparative observational study (n=80) Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods An 80-person inpatient cohort with mild COVID-19 infection were given hy - droxychloroquine and azithromycin over a period of 3 or more days. Measure - ments included clinical outcome, contagiousness via PCR and culture, and length of stay in infectious disease unit (IDU). Findings All cases in this 80-patient cohort showed improvement in outcome mea - sures following administration of combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin except for two patients- one of which arrived to the hospital in an advanced form, and another patient who was still in intensive care at the time of writing. There was a drop in nasopharyngeal viral load with 83% testing negative on Day 7 and 93% on Day 8. Culture positivity began to decline on Day 2 with viral cultures being completely negative in 97.5% of patients on Day 5. Patients were discharged from the IDU with mean length of stay being 5 days. Clinical ImplicationsCombination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin shows promise in the treatment for SARS-CoV-2. It is important to intervene in the early stages of dis - ease with a treatment regimen to prevent progression to the irreversible severe respiratory complications. Limitations This was an uncontrolled study with a small sample size. The participants had a relatively mild clinical presentation, so the efficacy of this combination was not determined in more severe cases. There was also no analytic approach per - formed to look for potential confounding variables. Criteria for discharge was altered over the course of the study going from two successive negative naso - pharyngeal samples from PCR assay. TREATMENTReview by Christina Brown, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubManagement of COVID-19 Respiratory Distress John J. Marini et al. JAMA April 24, 2020 DOI: 10.1001/jama.2020.6825 Purpose The purpose of this article is to summarize the current recommendations for ventilation support in COVID-19 patients with ARDS Study design Literature Review Level of evidence5 Methods This paper reviewed current literature on the management of COVID-19 ventilation sup - port. The authors describe two patient phenotypes: Type L and Type H . infiltrates, infiltrates of atelectasis and edema, lower compliance, PEEP responsive, overtly dyspneic Findings -In the early stages of CARDS (COVID-19 with ARDS), the objective should be ade - quate gas exchange and avoidance of patient self-induced lung injury (P-SILI) from powerful respiratory effort causing lung and vascular stress. Options include sup - plemental O2, ventilation (NIV), and target nonvigorous breathing. Early intubation, effective sedation, and/ or paralysis may interrupt this cycle. For Type L patients after intubation, the goal is to minimize pulmonary stress, optimize O2, and avoid VILI (ventilator-induced lung injury) vortex. Use lower PEEP (<10 cm H2O), use more liberal tidal volume (7-9 mL/ kg) as needed, and consider prone positioning. If lung edema increases in the Type L patient (either because of the disease itself and/or P-SILI), Type H phenotype progressively develops. The goal in Type H patients after intubation is to reduce and evenly distrib - ute lung and vascular stresses, optimize O2, and avoid VILI. Use higher PEEP (<15 cm H2O), lower tidal volume (5-7 mL/kg), reduce O2 demand and implement prone position - ing. Despite the disease type, weaning should be undertaken cautiously. The goal for the weaning phase is to avoid reversion to previously worsened pulmonary state by causing VILI and worsening edema. Clinical ImplicationsThe recommendations described above represent the most current ventilation recom - mendations in COVID-19 patients with ARDS and could improve outcomes. Limitations This paper attempts to categorize COVID patients with respiratory distress into two groups; however, not all patients may conveniently fall into each of these two groups but rather fall along a spectrum of respiratory compromise.TREATMENTReview by Eric Moyer, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubHydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial Philippe Gautret et al. Int J Antimicrob Agents March 20, 2020 DOI: 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.105949 Purpose This clinical trial aims to assess the effect of hydroxychloroquine +/- azithromycin on respi - ratory viral loads in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients compared to a control group. Study design Open label, non-randomized clinical trial (n=36) Level of evidence3 Methods 36 of 42 patients who met inclusion criteria (age >12 and PCR documented SARS-CoV-2 carriage in nasopharyngeal sample at admission regardless of clinical status) were seen at baseline for enrollment, initial data collection and treatment at day 0, and again for daily follow-up for 14 days. Patients in the study group received oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate 200 mg TID for 10 days. Among hydroxychloroquine- treated patients (n=20), six received azithromycin (500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg per day for the next 4 days) to prevent bacterial super-infection. The primary endpoint was virological clearance at day-6 post-inclusion. Findings The proportion of patients that had negative PCR results in nasopharyngeal samples was significantly different between treated patients and controls at days 3-4-5 and 6 post-in - clusion. At day 6, 70% of hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were virologicaly cured comparing with 12.5% in the control group (P=0.001). Similarly, the addi - tion of azithromycin led to a statistically significant benefit (100% patients were virologically cured) when compared to the hydroxychloroquine-only treatment group (57.1%, P<0.001) at days 3-4-5 and 6 post-inclusion. Overall, it is shown that hydroxychloroquine is efficient in clearing viral nasopharyngeal carriage of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients in only three to six days. These preliminary results also suggest a synergistic effect of the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin; however, it is important to note that only six patients were given azithromycin in addition to hydroxychloroquine. Clinical Implications-Hydroxychloroquine alone for the treatment of COVID-19 may be useful in reducing viral loads, but larger randomized trials should be performed -The addition of azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients may pro - vide an additional benefit in reducing viral loads but larger randomized trials are required. Limitations There were limitations of this study including a small sample size, limited long-term out - come follow-up, and a dropout of six patients from the study. This clinical trial was also not randomized, which could introduce bias into the study.TREATMENTReview by Eric Moyer, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubPharmacologic treatments for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) James M. Sanders JAMA Network April 13, 2020 DOI: 10.1001/jama.2020.6019 Purpose To summarize current evidence regarding major proposed, repurposed or experi - mental treatments for COVID-19 and to provide a summary of current clinical expe - rience and treatment guidance for COVID-19. Study design Literature Review Level of evidenceN/A Methods A literature review was performed using PubMed to identify relevant English-lan - guage articles published through March 25th, 2020. Search terms included 'corona - virus' treatment and pharma - cology. Case reports, case series, and review articles were included due to the lack of randomized controlled trials. Currently active clinical trials were also included using the disease search term 'coronavirus infection' on ClinicalTrials.gov and the in - dex of studies of novel coronavirus pneumonia in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. Findings Treatment recommendations based on clinical treatment experience, descriptive reports, and case series should be interpreted with caution due to lack of clinical trials. There are currently no medical therapies that have been definitively shown to improve outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Several drugs have demonstrated in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 virus favipiravir. Clinical ImplicationsThere is currently no effective therapy for COVID-19, and therefore there is an ur - gent need for randomized clinical trials to test the effectiveness of proposed thera - pies. Limitations To date, published data is limited to observational studies and small clinical trials with less than 250 patients. This review focused primarily on adult patients and lacks data on pediatric population infected with SARS-CoV-2. The amount of pub - lished literature is rapidly growing, and recommendations are constantly changing.TREATMENTReview by Sarah Sun, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubRemdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro Manli Wang et al. Cell Research, Nature Publishing Group February 4, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41422-020-0282-0 Purpose To determine which drug is the most effective in treating the 2019-nCov virus. Study design Letter to the editor - in vitro lab study Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods Seven drugs, Ribavirin, Penciclovir, Nitazoxanide, Nafamostat, Chloroquine, Remdesivir and Favipiravir, were their efficacy against 2019-nCov in vitro. Vero E6 cells were infected with the COVID virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05 with various degrees of concentration of the trial drugs for 48 hours. For the control group, DMSO was used instead. The primary endpoint was to determine the cytotoxici - ty of these drugs using CCK-8 assays, as well as the viral yield which was determined by quantifying the superna-tant using RT-PCR. This was later confirmed by using immu - nofluorescence to visualize the virus nucleoprotein expression. The results are listed below showcasing the half-maximal effective concentration used (EC50 in micromoles) and the selectivity index (SI) achieved during testing. Findings - Ribavirin (EC50 = 109.50, SI > = 61.88, SI > 6.46), the 3 nucleoside analogs, required high levels of concen - tration to reduce the viral infection. - Nafamostat (EC50 = 22.50, SI > 4.44) which prevents membrane fusion, was inhibitive against the Covid virus. - Nitazoxanide, (EC50 = 2.12, SI > 16.76) an antiprotozoal agent, was able to inhibit 2019 nCoV at low micro molar concentration. - Remdesevir (EC50 = 0.77, SI > 129.87) and Cloroquine (EC50 = 1.13, SI > 88.50) were able to block the virus infection at low micro molar concentration and demonstrated high selectivity index. Clinical ImplicationsFurther in vivo studies are required to evaluate the true efficacy of these drugs, however, Remdesevir and Cloroquine appear promising . Their low micromolar concentration and high selectivity index to block virus infection sets them apart from other drugs. Limitations The study was conducted in vitro using Vero E6 cells which are derived from the Afri - can green monkey and hence may not be translatable to human trials. As a letter to the editor, it is not clear if this study has been peer-reviewed.TREATMENTReview by Maria Amir, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubSome Drugs for COVID-19 The Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics April 6, 2020 Retrieved from: secure.medicalletter.org/w1595a Purpose To review current data regarding the efficacy or lack thereof for the use of repurposed drugs in the treatment of COVID-19 in addition to the impact of commonly used daily medications on COVID-19 disease progression. Study design Review Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods The researchers summarized the clinical evidence related to repurposing of drugs for the treat - ment of COVID-19. They chose agents that have been widely reported on as potential treatments. Findings -ACE inhibitors and ARBS : There is no clinical evidence to suggest these agents increase or decrease the severity of COVID-19. Patients who take these drugs and contract COVID-19 should continue their medications as prescribed. -NSAIDS : There is no clinical evidence that NSAIDs increase or decrease the severity of COVID-19, however continued fever suppression with NSAIDs can possibly decrease the immune system and increase the duration of viral shedding. Patients who are taking NSAIDs for other indications should not stop taking them. -Lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) : When compared to standard care in clinical trial of severely dis - eased COVID-19 patients, Kaletra was no more effective than the standard of care alone and Soci - ety of Critical Care Medicine does not recommend its use in critically ill patients. -Hydroxychloroquine with Azithromycin : Open label study in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in France suggests enhanced viral load reduction compared to treatment of hydroxychloroquine alone. These drugs can prolong the QT interval - clinical trials evaluating safety and efficacy are in progress. -IL-6 inhibitors (ie: tocilizumab, sarilumab) : Insufficient data, clinical trials are in progress to see if these agents and reduce cytokine induced lung damage in patients with severe disease. -Convalescent sera : Passive antibody therapy using serum of recovered patients was both safe and reduced viral load in Chinese patients who were treated early in the course of their infection with COVID-19. There are ongoing studies to examine this effect in critically ill patients. Clinical ImplicationsThe data summarized in this review helps guide clinicians in the treatment of COVID-19 and helps delineate between evidence-based practice and media publicization of available agents. The authors also advise that until clinical trials clearly establish the safety and efficacy of any drug used for COVID-19 treatment, current standard of practice is supportive treatment and management of COVID-19 complications. Limitations This review was unable to adequately synthesize efficacy of the drugs highlighted in this review due to lack of high quality RCTs. Also, little data describing the effect of the drugs in patients with different disease severity; the review findings only commented on limited ranges of disease sever - ity.TREATMENTReview by Demetrios Geanon, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubEvaluation of Antiviral Therapies for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia in Shanghai, China Xiudong Shi et al. J Med Virol. April 16, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25893 Purpose Evaluate the therapeutic effect of antiviral drugs on COVID-19 pneumonia. Study design Single-center, retrospective review (n=184) Level of evidence4 Methods A total of 184 patients seen at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center that tested positive for COVID-19 were divided into 7 different groups according to their treatment, which was administered over a 5-day period. The groups were as follows: (1) symptomatic treatment only (2) Arbidol, (3) Lopinavir/Ritonavir, (4) Arbidol and Lopinavir/Ritonavir, (5) Interferon, (6) Interferon and Lopinavir/Ri - tonavir, and (7) Interferon and Darunavir. Chest CT scans at admission and at day 1 or 2 after treatment were reviewed and the Quantitative Evaluation System of CT for Pneumonia was utilized to calculate pulmonary inflammation volume (pneumonia volume). Findings The average pneumonia volume in all groups increased, except in the In - terferon and Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination group. However, differences between groups (i.e. Lopinavir/Ritonavir treatment alone or in combination with Interferon-2 or Arbidol) were not statistically significant . While there was also no significant difference in pneumonia resolution among the groups, the highest proportion of pneumonia resolution was in the Interferon and Lopinavir/Ritonavir combination group, followed by the Interferon and Daruna - vir combination group. Clinical ImplicationsThis study did not find that the addition of antiviral drugs in therapeutic regi - mens reduced the volume of lung affected by pneumonia in COVID-19 patients, nor did it significantly shorten their hospital stay compared to symptomatic treatment alone. The treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia remains challenging, as there are no specific and effective drugs available. Limitations This study set the treatment period of 5 days, which may not have been long enough to see results. Additionally, results of quantitative detection of viral load were not reported as part of this study and CT follow up findings were not in - cluded.TREATMENTReview by Athena Jane Manatis-Lornell, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubCurrent evidence for directed and supportive investigational therapies against COVID-19 R van Rensburg et al. African Journal of Thoracic and Critical Care Medicine April 30, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.7196/AJTCCM.2020.v26i2.072 Purpose To investigate types of therapies currently being studied for treatment of COVID-19. Study design Systematic Review Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Authors used current literature published in peer-reviewed scientific journals to determine current evidence regarding several types of therapeutic interventions for the treatment of COVID-19. Findings Two groups of therapies were evaluated, directed therapies and supported therapies. Directed therapies included hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, immunomodulato - ry drugs that show in vitro activity against COVID-19, theorized to be due to increasing endosomal pH to inhibit COVID-19 spike protein cleavage, preventing entry. Studies are showing conflicting evidence of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine having no effect or being able to reduce viral shedding. Lopinavir/ritonavir are protease inhibitors that have shown in vitro activity against SARS-CoV. Case reports show successful man - agement with lopinavir/ritonavir combination. Remdesivir is a nucleotide analogue de - veloped against the Ebola virus which shows in vitro activity against COVID-19. Supported therapies included tocilizumab and corticosteroids. Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor that is approved for treating cytokine release syndrome. Trials have shown patients improving following inadequate response to standard care. Cortico - steroid trials are inconclusive or showed potential to cause harm. Clinical ImplicationsThere is a lack of in vivo and human studies to determine which therapy, if any, is effective in treating COVID-19. Studies for hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab show promise based on in vitro studies, but there is significant lack of data to conclude what is effective in treating COVID-19. Studies typically started later in the disease course, after organ damage had potentially occurred. Limitations There are limited peer-reviewed publications out currently that can further knowledge of therapeutic studies. These studies also are started late in the disease course when it may be too late to prevent irreversible organ damage.TREATMENTReview by Christi Brown, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubTriple Combination of Interferon beta-1b, Lopinavir-Ritonavir, and Ribavirin in the Treatment of Patients Admitted to Hospital with COVID-19: An Open-label, Randomised, Phase 2 Trial Ivan Fan-Ngai Hung et al. The Lancet May 08, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31042-4 Purpose To assess the efficacy and safety of a triple anti-viral therapy consisting of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir-ritonavir, and ribavirin for treatment of patients with COVID-19. Study design Multicenter prospective, open-label, randomized, phase 2 trial Level of evidenceLevel 2 Methods Patients diagnosed with mild to moderate COVID-19 were randomly assigned (2:1) to a 14-day combination therapy consisting of lopinavir (400mg) and ritonavir (100mg) ev - ery 12 hours, ribavirin (400mg) every 12 hours, and three doses of 8 million IU of inter - feron beta-1b on alternate days (combination growth) or 14 days of lopinavir 400mg and ritonavir 100mg every 12 hours (control group). The primary endpoint was the time to RT-PCR negative nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. The secondary end - point was time to resolution of symptoms defined as a national early warning score of 0 maintained for 24 hours, and length of hospital stay. Findings Patients receiving combination therapy demonstrated superior clinical improvement with shorter time to complete symptom resolution (4 days), significantly shorter time from initiation of treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab (7 days), and shorter mean hospital stay (9 days) when compared to the control group (8, 12, and 14.5 days respectively). Treatment was also shown to be safe with minor and self-limited gastro - intestinal adverse events of diarrhea and vomiting with no difference in rate between those receiving combination therapy and the control group. In addition, serum levels of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) were significantly lower in patients treated with combination therapy on treatment days 2, 6, and 8. Clinical ImplicationsEarly treatment with triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir-ri - tonavir in alleviating symptom s and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospitalization in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Triple antiviral therapy rapidly rendered viral load negative in all patients, thereby reducing infectiousness of the patient. Limitations The trial was open label without inclusion of a placebo group. Results were confound - ed by the subgroup omitting interferon beta-1b within the combination group and were dependent on time of symptom onset. The absence of critically ill patients does not allow for the generalization of findings to severe cases.TREATMENTReview by Ashley Wehrheim, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubInfectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19 Adarsh Bhimraj et al. Clinical Infectious Diseases April 17, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa478 Purpose To develop evidence-based rapid guidelines intended to support patients, clinicians, and oth - er health-care professionals in their decision-making regarding treatment and management of patients with COVID-19. Study design Systematic Review Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of nine infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, and methodologists with varied areas of expertise. Clinical questions in PICO format (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes) were developed and panel members prioritized questions with available evidence meeting minimum acceptable criteria (i.e., body of evidence reported on at least a case-series design, case reports excluded). A systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature from Ovid Medline and Embase was then conducted. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess certainty of evidence and make recommendations. 435 viable references were identified, of which 13 informed the evi - dence base for the authors' recommendations. Findings The IDSA guideline panel recommends that treatment of COVID-19 infected patients with the following agents should be limited to the context of a clinical trial: hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), HCQ + plasma transfusion, and corticosteroids (based on indirect findings from systematic review of SARS and MERS outbreaks). Of note, if a patient is receiving steroid therapy for another indica - tion (e.g., asthma), the steroid should not be discontinued. Clinical ImplicationsGiven that the panel could not make a determination whether the benefits outweigh harms for HCQ, azithromycin, steroids, or IL-6 inhibitors, it would be ethical to enroll patients with COVID-19 in clinical trials, rather than use clinically unproven therapies. There are about 100 ongoing clinical trials on COVID-19 in the U.S. alone, which will allow us to understand more about the effects of these treatments and their potential therapeutic benefits within the com - ing months. Limitations Due to the urgency in producing, synthesizing, and disseminating data during the current pandemic, an increase in \"fast-tracked\" study publication has resulted in issues including circumvention of usual research steps (delay of IRB approval, inclusion of same patients in several studies), a limited peer-review process, and increased potential for publication bias (in the interest of showing promising data). The extent and impact of these considerations were acknowledged in the development of these IDSA guidelines.TREATMENTReview by Emily Chi, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubTreatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and combination in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 Samia Arshad et al. International Journal of Infectious Diseases June 29, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.06.099 Purpose To evaluate the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine therapy alone and in combination with azith - romycin in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Study design Multi-center Retrospective Observational Study (n=2541) Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Retrospective analysis of 2,541 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 10-May 2, 2020 at 6 hospitals in the Henry Ford Health System in Southeast Michigan was completed. All treatments were protocol driven and uniform across hospitals. Hydroxychloroquine was administered as two 400 mg doses on day 1, followed by 200mg twice daily on days 2-5. Azithromycin was used as one 500mg dose on day 1, followed by 250mg once daily on days 2-5. Combination therapy was reserved for patients with severe COVID-19 and minimal cardiac risk fac - tors. Clinical protocols also included adjunctive immunomodulatory therapy with corticosteroids and tocilizumab. Primary endpoint was in-patient hospital mortality. Findings The average age of patients was 64 years, 51% were male, 56% were African American, and the mean BMI was 31.7. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (65.4%), chronic lung dis - ease (63.7%), chronic kidney disease (43.3%), and diabetes mellitus (37.6%). Overall mortality rate was 18.1%. Group mortality rates were 13.5% in the hydroxychloroquine alone group, 20.1% in the hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin group, 22.4% in the azithromycin alone group, and 26.4% in the group receiving neither drug, respectively. Primary causes of mortality were respiratory failure (88%), cardiopulmonary arrest and multi-organ failure (8%) and cardiac arrest (4%)(mean QTc in - terval from last ECG reading 471 ms). Compared to patients who took neither drug, treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone decreased mortality hazard ratio by 66% (p<0.001) whereas hydroxy - chloroquine plus azithromycin decreased ratio by 71% (p<0.001). Clinical ImplicationsTreatment with hydroxychloroquine alone and hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin was associated with a significant reduction in mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. This therapy is most effective when applied prior to the hyperimmune response associated with COVID-19. Limitations This study was non-blinded and non-randomized, limiting its ability to evaluate the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine therapy in treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In addition, improved patient mortality may be due to corticosteroid treatment. 78.9% of patients receiving hy - droxychloroquine and 74.3% of patients receiving hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin received adjunct corticosteroid therapy, compared to 35.7% of patients receiving neither therapy and 38.8% receiving only azithromycin. It is also possible that the different dosing used in this study relative to previous studies not showing a benefit of hydroxychloroquine made a difference in the outcome.TREATMENTReview by Alex Hodakowski, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubEfficacy of hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19: results of a randomized clinical trial Zhaowei Chen et al. medRxiv April 10, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.22.20040758 Purpose To investigate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in addition to standard treatment in patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 Study design Randomized double-blind study (n = 62 patients) Level of evidenceLevel 2 Methods Patients were followed for 6 days. The treatment group received 400mg/day of oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ) tablets on days 1-5 plus Standard Treatment (O2 therapy, antiviral agents, antibiotics, and immunoglobulin +/- corticosteroids). The control group was given Standard Treatment only. Findings Statistically significant differences were observed favoring the treatment group vs the control group for improvement in Chest CT findings (p=0476), days for reso - lution in fever (p=0.0008) and days for resolution of cough (p=0016). Only 2 of 31 patients in the treatment group developed side effects that were not \"severe\" . Clinical ImplicationsAlthough this study suggests that hyoxychloroquine treatment for patients with mild COVID-19 disease is beneficial, auxiliary treatment modalities are unspeci - fied and may have confounded the results, the patients enrolled were relative - ly young and the observation time was limited. Limitations The results may not be applicable to hospitalized patients in the US due to the ex - clusion criteria. Patients with cardiac conduction/arrhythmias were excluded which could limit the use of this medication in hospital patients who often are sicker at baseline and with significant cardiac comorbidities. Similarly, patients with renal and liver dysfunction at baseline were excluded, limiting application. Patients were of relatively young age (44.7 yrs), all patients had \"mild disease\" , the observation period was limited to 6 days and most significantly the standard therapy included confounding and unspecified treatments: antiviral agents, antibiotics and immu - noglobulin +/- corticosteroids. This standard care is worrisome as we do no know which patients received which antiviral agent or antibiotics and which patients received immuglobulin and in those who received immunoglobulin which also received corticosteroids. TREATMENTReview by Joseph deBettencourt, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubChloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 Robin E Ferner et al. BMJ April 8, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m1432 Purpose To advise on the potential premature use and potential harm of chloroquine and hy - droxychloroquine in COVID-19. Study design Editorial Level of evidenceN/A Methods Authors report their opinions on how previous lab studies in combination with poor methods and reporting may show that the early use of 4-aminoquinolines, chloro - quine and hydroxychloroquine may lead to potential harm. Findings In cell cultures and animal studies, the effects of 4-aminoquinolines on viruses from H5N1 to Zika have been variable. For example, in one study of chikungunya virus, chlo - roquine was active in laboratory studies but worsened the clinical course of infection in monkeys. The disparity between laboratory and clinical experiments may be due to the complex pharmokinetics of 4-aminoquinolines, making it hard to use the correct concentration in culture media to doses in humans. Many studies currently coming out about positive findings of hydroxychloroquine treatment of COVID-19 include poor methods as well as unreliable results. Although advocates have deemed hydroxychlo - roquine as safe and widely used, that cannot be guaranteed and can expose some patients to rare and potentially fatal reactions. There have been previous medications that have been withdrawn because of adverse reactions after showing clinical promise. Clinical Implications\u00b7 Many studies have shown that 4-aminoquinolines, such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, are active against a range of viruses, but the translation to clini - cal use as treatment with multiple other viruses has not proven as useful. \u00b7 There is to be more success in COVID-19 treatment via prevention by a vaccine or treatment with drugs that target specific structures in the virus rather than using old drugs that may work in the laboratory, but lack data supporting clinical use. \u00b7 There needs to be better, properly powered, randomized controlled trials of chloro - quine or hydroxychloroquine in order to prove effectiveness. Until then, SARS-CoV-2 is \"essentially untreatable\" except for supportive measures. Limitations The editorial only referred to two studies of 4-aminoquinolines in COVID-19 treatment that had poor study designs, while also citing previous studies in a wide range of virus - es, which are not directly compared to the pathogenesis of SARS-Cov-2.TREATMENTReview by Amanda Narkis, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubEffect of High vs Low Doses of Chloroquine Diphosphate as Adjunc - tive Therapy for Patients Hospitalized With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection Mayla Gabriela Silva Borba et al.

Of 131 patients admitted to the hospital with acute respiratory dis - tress syndrome (ARDS) older than 18 years of age, 81 were determined to be positive for COVID-19 by RT-PCR or have a high likelihood of having COVID-19 by epidemiologic data. 41 patients were placed on high dose CQ (600mg BID for 10 days) and 40 were placed on low dose CQ (450mg BID for one day then 450mg daily for 4 days; placebo tablets were used such that low dose patients took equal number of total tablets as high dose pa - tients). The study hypothesized that lethality would be decreased by 50% in the high-dos - age versus the low-dosage group. Findings At day 13, lethality was 39.0% (16/41) in the high-dose group in the low-dosage group, additionally 86.4% (19/22) of the deceased still had virologic con - firmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection antemortem . These findings showed the opposite of the study's hypothesis and the safety review board recommended the immediate inter - ruption of the study. This study shows no evidence of benefit or increased viral clear - ance with use of chloroquine in patients presenting with SARS-CoV-2. High-dose chloroquine was associated with increased mortality over low-dose chloroquine dosing and over historical mortality data of similar patients with SARS-CoV-2. Clinical ImplicationsThis trial suggests use of high-dose CQ (12g) given concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir is not safe, showed no evidence of benefit, and should not be used to treat patients with severe COVID-19. Limitations The study was ended early due to concerns for increased lethality with high-dose regimen, leaving the study underpowered to detect efficacy of either dosages. It also only focuses on critically ill patients and results may not be generalizable to less severe disease. All patients received oseltamivir (for influenza) which is also known to increase the QTc inter - val. It is possible increased lethality of CQ may have resulted from synergistic cardiotoxic effects. No placebo group was used.

Journal of Zhejiang University (Medical Sciences) March 6, 2020 DOI: 10.3785/j.issn.1008-9292.2020.03.03 Purpose To study the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine sulfate treatment in COVID-19 Study design Single-center, randomized study (n = 30 patients) Level of evidenceLevel 2 Methods The experimental group received hydroxychloroquine sulfate 400mg once a day for 5 days plus conventional treatment. The control received conventional treatment alone. Conventional treatment included bed rest, oxygen support, symptomatic care, antiviral medications (nebulized IFN-alpha, oral lopinavir/ritonavir), and antibi - otics. The primary endpoint of the study was negative conversion rate of COVID-19 nucleic acid in respiratory pharyngeal swab on day 7 after randomization or death within 2 weeks. Secondary endpoints were serious adverse effects or deterioration of patient's condition within 2 weeks. Findings By day seven, 86.7% (13/15) of the trial group and 93.3% (14/15) of the control group tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 via pharyngeal swab. At two weeks all pa - tients tested negative, and were clinically improved. Clinical ImplicationsThis study showed no improvement in clearance or change in mortality with the addition of hydroxychloroquine to the conventional treatment. This study suggests that hydroxychloroquine is not effective as an adjuvant medication in addition to current standards of care. Limitations The study had a small sample size of only 30 patients. It excluded any patients with serious comorbidities. These exclusions make the results difficult to generalize to critically ill patients. The authors also noted that their study was underpowered to determine if HCQ was better or worse than standard care, by their estimates at least 784 subjects would be needed to appropriately power the study.TREATMENTReview by Joseph deBettencourt, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubObservational Study of Hydroxychloroquine in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19 Joshua Geleris et al. The New England Journal of Medicine May 7, 2020 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2012410 Purpose To investigate the relationship between hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) use and respiratory failure using a composite endpoint of intubation and/or death as major predictors of respiratory failure. Study design Observational study (n=1376) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods De-identified data (age, sex, ethnicity, insurance, initial vital signs, arterial partial pressure of O2 to the fraction of inspired oxygen ratio [PaO2/FIO2] at admission, BMI, initial lab tests, smoking status, past medical history, medication administration, HCQ exposure, and outcomes [dis - charge, death, intubation]) from time of admission to death or discharge (prior to April 25, 2020) of COVID-19 positive patients hospitalized for a minimum of 24 hours between March 7-April 8, 2020 at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) were extracted and analyzed. Treat - ment with HCQ was at provider discretion and consistent with current hospital guidelines (600 mg twice on day 1, followed by 400 mg daily for 4 additional days). Bivariate frequencies were calculated to evaluate associations between pre-admission variables. Cox proportional hazard regression models were run to analyze association between HCQ exposure and outcomes of death or intubation. Additional models were used to account for demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables. To reduce risk of confounding, propensity scores for receipt of HCQ were calculated and used in inverse probability weighted analysis for Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox models. Additional analyses were completed for patients admitted at least 48 hours. Findings 1376 patients were followed for a median of 22.5 days, 811 (58.9%) received HCQ. Among pa - tients recieving HCQ, administration began after 24 hours in 45.8% and after 48 hours in 85.9%. Patients receiving HCQ demonstrated lower PaO2:FIO2 at baseline than those who did not (median, 233 vs 360 mmHg). Death or intubation occurred in 346 (262 received HCQ, 84 did not). While crude analysis hazard ratios (HR) showed a significant association between HCQ use and death/intubation (HR: 2.37), no significant association was observed in the multivariable analysis with inverse probability weighting (HR: 1.04). No association was found between death/intuba - tion and azithromycin use (HR: 1.03) Clinical ImplicationsThis study does not support the routine use of HCQ for COVID-19 patients as they found no association (neither harm nor benefit) between the drug's use and patient outcomes of death or intubation. This study recommends that HCQ should only be used in clinical trials for efficacy. More research is needed to determine the best dose, when to administer (and for how long), and how the risks and benefits of these medications compare when treating COVID-19 patients. Limitations This study was observational in nature and used relatively wide confidence intervals, there - fore these findings cannot rule out the harms or benefits of HCQ use in patients infected with COVID-19. As an observational study (i.e., the authors only looked at the end results without involving treatment), the analysis is subject to unmeasured confounding and bias, although attempts were made to limit their impact.TREATMENTReview by Kavya Timmireddy, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubHydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19: a multinational registry analysis Mandeep R Mehra et al.

Study design Multinational registry analysis Level of evidenceLevel 2 Methods SARS-CoV-2 positive patients hospitalized between December 20, 2019-April 14, 2020 from 671 hospitals in 6 continents were placed in a registry. Patients were divided into a control group receiving no treatment, or one of four groups receiving treatment with chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with or without a macrolide. Individuals receiving treatment after 48 hours or while on mechanical ventilation and those receiving remdesivir were ex - cluded. Primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included ventricular arrhythmia frequency, rate of progression to mechanical ventilation, and total length of stay in an intensive care unit. Data were collected on patient baseline characteristics, underlying comorbidities, smoking history, and baseline medications. To determine baseline risk, cox pro - portional hazards regression analysis was performed and hazard ratios (HR) were obtained. Findings 98262 patients were reviewed, 2230 were excluded, leaving 96032 patients (mean age: 53.8 the treatment group and 81144 in the control group. When comparing survivors with non-survivors, the latter were more likely to be older, obese, African-American, Hispanic, diabetic, have coronary artery disease, con - gestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hyperlipidemia, history of arrhythmias, or history of smoking. Mortality was higher in treatment groups compared to the control population (p<0.0001). Control group mortality rate was 7530/81144 (9.3%) ver - 307/1868 in HCQ w/ macro - lide. All treatment groups showed increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias with hazard ratios ranging from 2.369 5.106 (for HCQ w/ macrolide). Clinical ImplicationsThis is the largest and most comprehensive data set thus far evaluating the efficacy of CQ and HCQ. The large number of facilities and patients from multiple geographic regions that partic - ipated in this study increases the generalizability of findings. No clinical benefit was observed with use of CQ or HCQ with or without macrolide antibiotics, and use of these agents increased risk of mortality and ventricular arrhythmias. These drugs should not be used for treatment of COVID-19 outside of a controlled trial until a randomized clinical study can be performed. Limitations STUDY RETRACTED This is an observational study; cause and effect relationship cannot be inferred from this data (i.e., association does not imply causation). While the \"n\" is large, it does not review controlled trials. Treatment regimens were not uniform between hospitals and these results do not apply to outpatient settings.

Journal of the American Medical Association Cardiology May 1, 2020 DOI: 10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1787 Purpose To evaluate changes in corrected QT (QTc) interval among critically ill COVID-19 positive pa - tients receiving therapy with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) alone or in combination with azithro - mycin. Study design Retrospective case series (n=40) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods COVID-19 positive patients (via PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swab) admitted to the inten - sive care unit (ICU) between March 15 and March 29, 2020 were included in the analysis. All patients received HCQ monotherapy (200 mg, twice a day, for 10 days). A subset of patients also received azithromycin (250 mg daily, for 5 days). Patients were not included in the analy - sis if baseline QTc was greater than 460 ms. Patients underwent daily electrocardiogram (ECG) and continuous monitoring of the QTc interval. Prolonged QTc was the primary endpoint and was classified by one of two parameters: a QTc change (DQTc) of more than 60 ms or a pro - longed QTc interval of more than 500 ms. Findings The outcomes of 40 COVID-19 patients who received HCQ alone (55%) or in combination with azithromycin (45%) were examined. Of these, the median age was 68 years, 32 (75%) were male, 30 (75%) required intubation, and 25 (63%) required vasoactive medications. Most patients (93%) had an increase in QTc after administration of therapy, regardless of treatment group. 10 patients (25%) demonstrated a DQTc of more than 60 ms and 7 patients (17.5%) demonstrated prolonged QTc intervals of more than 500 ms, with some patients meeting both criteria. By the authors' definition, 14 total patients (36%) demonstrated prolonged QTc. A greater percentage of patients in the combination therapy group (33%), compared to those in the monotherapy group (5%, p=0.03), demonstrated a DQTc of more than 60 ms. No ventricu - lar arrhythmias were seen in either group, but therapy was stopped in 45% of patients due to ECG abnormalities or acute renal failure. Clinical ImplicationsHCQ and azithromycin use in COVID-19 positive patients may result in prolongation of the QTc interval, particularly when administered together. Authors suggest that this treatment should only be used when patients can be closely monitored because serious complications may de - velop. Further research conducted in a larger number of patients may help to clarify the risks and benefits of these therapies. Limitations This was a small case series conducted at a single site. In addition to small sample size, gener - alizability is limited due to all patients receiving ICU level care.

Journal of the American Medical Association Cardiology May 1, 2020 DOI: 10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1834 Purpose To evaluate QTc changes in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia treated with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) monotherapy or in combination with azithromycin. Study design Observational, retrospective cohort study at a single center. Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Clinical data were obtained from COVID-19 positive patients diagnosed (via PCR analysis of nasopharyngeal swabs) between March 1 and April 7, 2020. All patients received at least one day of HCQ monotherapy or HCQ with concomitant azithromycin. Data were analyzed at the cohort level and comparisons were made between the monotherapy and combina - tion therapy groups. Primary endpoints of interest included DQTc from baseline, develop - ment of prolonged QTc greater than 500ms, and development of adverse drug events. Findings The study was comprised of 90 patients with a mean age of 60.1 years, mean BMI of 31.5, and 48.9% female. At the cohort level, median baseline QTc was 455ms, 11% of patients had a DQTc of greater than 60ms, and 20% demonstrated post-treatment QTc of more than 500ms. In the monotherapy group, 3% of patients had a DQTc of more than 60ms and 19% demonstrated a prolonged QTc. In the combination therapy group, 13% had a DQTc of more than 60ms and 21% had a prolonged QTc. The likelihood of a prolonged QTc was greater in those taking loop diuretics (31% vs 12%, p=0.03) and those with a of greater than 450ms (30% vs 8%, p=0.008). Both findings remained independently associated after adjusting for at least two systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. One patient ultimately developed torsades de pointes and other ventricular ar - rhythmias. Clinical ImplicationsPatients receiving HCQ therapy alone or in combination with azithromycin for the treat - ment of COVID-19 pneumonia experience alterations in QTc which may progress to signif - icant arrhythmias. Larger scale research is required to further characterize the risk-benefit ratio of such medications in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Limitations This retrospective, non-randomized study consisted of only 90 patients at a single medical center and did not include a control arm to evaluate potential changes to QTc attributable to COVID-19. Patients in the study were not stratified by illness severity and it is possible that sicker patients may demonstrate more profound changes to QTc due to disease pro - gression and administration of additional medications.TREATMENTReview by Steven Heidt, MD Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubAssociation of Treatment With Hydroxychloroquine or Azithromycin With In-Hospital Mortality in Patients With COVID-19 in New York State Eli S. Rosenberg et al. Journal of the American Medical Association May 11, 2020 DOI: 10.1001/jama.2020.8630 Purpose To evaluate in-patient mortality of COVID-19 positive patients treated with hydroxychlo - roquine (HCQ) with or without azithromycin as compared to patients treated with nei - ther drug. Study design Retrospective cohort study (n=1438 patients) Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Lab confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted across 25 New York hospitals for at least 24 hours between March 15 and March 28, 2020 were randomly selected. Only hospitals with at least 45 COVID-19 discharges or deaths within that time frame were included. Medications, preexisting conditions, clinical measures on admission, outcomes, and ad - verse events were collected from medical records. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included cardiac arrest and abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) findings (e.g., arrhythmia or QT prolongation). The final date of follow up was April 24, 2020. Findings Of 1438 patients included in the study, 735 (51.1%) received HCQ and azithromycin, 271 (18.8%) received HCQ alone, 211 (14.7%) received azithromycin alone, and 221 (15.4%) received neither medication. Adjusted Cox proportional hazard models demonstrated no significant difference in in-hospital mortality in the combination therapy group (haz - ard ratio, HR: 1.35), HCQ group (HR: 1.08), or azithromycin group (HR: 0.56) when com - pared to patients receiving neither medication. An unadjusted logistic model demon - strated an elevated risk of cardiac arrest or abnormal ECG findings in patients receiving combination therapy (odds ratio, OR: 2.13), but adjusted models found no significant differences between groups. Clinical ImplicationsThere was no significant difference in in-patient mortality in COVID-19 positive patients treated with HCQ with or without azithromycin as compared to patients treated with neither drug. While there were no significant differences between groups regarding incidence of cardiac arrest or abnormal ECG findings, a risk-benefit calculation should be made when using these drugs. Limitations This observational study did not standardize medication dose among patients under evaluation. Mortality data was limited to in-hospital deaths, which assumes that dis - charged patients were still alive during the study period.TREATMENTReview by Steven Heidt, MD & Hannah Raff, MS4 Table Postexposure Prophy - laxis for Covid-19 David R. Boulware et al. The New England Journal of Medicine June 3, 2020 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2016638 Purpose Determine whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent symptomatic infection after SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Study design Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial Level of evidenceLevel 2 Methods A total of 821 asymptomatic patients who had household or occupational exposure to an individual with confirmed Covid-19 were enrolled. Patients were assigned within 4 days after exposure at a 1:1 ratio to receive either placebo or Hydroxychlo - roquine (800 mg once -> 600 mg 6-8 hours later -> 600 mg daily for 4 days). Findings There was no significant difference in incidence of new Covid-19 illness be - tween those receiving placebo (14.3%) and hydroxychloroquine (11.8%) during the 14 days follow-up (p=0.35) . Adherence in both groups was moderate, with 75.4% of hydroxychloroquine and 82.6% of placebo reporting 10% adherence to trail interventions. Side effects were more frequent in the hydroxychloroquine group (40.1%) than placebo (16.8%). Nausea, loose stools, and abdominal disten - sion were the most commonly reported, there were no severe adverse events. Clinical ImplicationsHydroxychloroquine did not prevent illness when used as a postexposure prophy - laxis within 4 days of moderate-risk or high-risk exposure to Covid-19. Limitations An internet recruitment of participants with participant reported data. Additionally, study size limited the power of investigation.

Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics April 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/cpt.1856 Purpose To improve Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) dosing for effective SARS-CoV-2 viral decline. Study design Systematic review with meta-analysis. Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods In vivo data was obtained from a published nonrandomized single arm open label study of HCQ 200 mg TID (w/wo azithromycin) for treatment of SARS-CoV-2. HCQ regimens of 200, 400, 600, and 800 mg BID for 5, 7 and 10 days (with and without loading dose) were simulated and evaluated based on externally predicted %PCR-negative patients in each cohort; each simu - lation included 100 virtual patients and was run 1000 times. PK/PD-corrected QT simulations were used to predict the risk of corrected QT prolongation with each HCQ regimen using a published PK-QTc model; the predicted relationship was validated as it successfully predicted QTc prolongation. Findings Each 1 uM increase in plasma HCQ was associated with a 28% decrease in viral load per day with an estimated 4.7. plasma concentration for 50% viral inhibition. Dosing regiments pro - ducing plasma concentrations at or above 7.5 uM were associated with >1% of patients hav - ing an increase of >60 ms QTc during treatment. HCQ 800 mg BID for 10 days was predicted to produce the lowest percentage of patients with detectable viral loads (9%), but was predicted to result in a significant probability of QTc prolongation . Dosing regiments of 400 mg BID for 7 or 10 days, and 600 mg BID for 5, 7 or 10 days were predicted to have lower detectable viral loads than those previously studied. Regimens of 200 mg BID orTID showed modest efficacy. Utilization of higher doses appeared to offer more benefit when compared with extended treatment duration . PK-QTc models demonstrated that the average patient could receive HCQ doses of 400 mg BID over 5 or 7 days with minimal risk (1.0-2.0%) of QTc prolongation. Clinical ImplicationsCurrent data and translational modeling indicates that dosing regimens of ~800 mg/day (either loaded or as 400 mg BID) would be safely tolerated and would reduce the time with a detectable SARS-CoV-2 viral load, improving treatment outcomes. Further examination in clinical trials is needed to evaluate safety and efficacy. Limitations Clinical HCQ data are limited to nonrandomized studies; no well-defined model for natural rate of viral decline exists. Additionally, drug efficacy at the site of action is determined by the fraction of drug unbound in tissue, which has not been studied for HCQ. Lastly, in vitro viral replication data was obtained from SARS-CoV-1 data and may not accurately represent SARS- CoV-2 replication rates and/or declines.TREATMENTReview by Abigail Bawden, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubEfficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir or arbidol in adult patients with mild/moderate COVID-19: an exploratory randomized con - trolled trial Yueping et al. medRxiv preprint April 15, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.20038984 Purpose To analyze the safety and efficacy of lopinavir/ritonavir or arbidol monotherapy in the treatment of mild-moderate COVID-19. Study design Non-blinded, Randomized Control Trial (n=86) Level of evidenceLevel 2 Methods This study was a single-center, randomized controlled trial performed at the Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital. 86 inpatients between the ages of 18 and 80 hospitalized with mild-moderate COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio into the following three groups: lopinavir/ritonavir 200 mg/50 mg twice daily for 7-14 days (n=34), arbidol 200 mg three times daily for 7-14 days (n=35), and a control group (n=17) who were not given any medication. Groups were followed for 21 days and patients in all groups received supportive care and oxygen therapy, if needed. The primary outcome was the rate of positive to negative conversion of COVID-19 rtPCR testing from the initiation of treatment until day 21 of follow-up. The secondary outcomes were the rate of positive to negative conversion of COVID-19 rtPCR testing from the initiation of treatment until days 7 and 14 of follow-up, the number of days until fever cessation follow - ing initiation of treatment, the number of days until cough cessation following initiation of treatment, and the improvement of chest CT imaging at days 7, 14, and 21 of follow-up. Findings There was no statistically significant difference in the mean number of days for positive to negative conversion of COVID-19 rtPCR testing across all three groups (about 9 days for each group). There was also no statistically significant difference in rates of positive to negative conversion of COVID-19 rtPCR testing at 7, 14, and 21 days of follow-up across all three groups. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in the rates of fever cessation, cough resolution, and improvement on chest CT imaging on follow-up days 7, 14, and 21 across all three groups. Clinical ImplicationsTreatment with either lopinavir/ritonavir or arbidol monotherapy in hospitalized patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 appears to provide minimal benefit on clinical outcomes. Limitations The sample size in this study is relatively small, limiting the power of the findings. Addi - tionally, critically ill patients and patients with many comorbidities that would likely pre - dispose them to adverse outcomes were excluded from the study, which limits the gener - alizability of the findings. Also this study has not been peer-reviewed. Lastly, the study was not blinded and took place at only one medical center in China.TREATMENTReview by Demetrios Geanon, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubArbidol monotherapy is superior to lopinavir/ritonavir in treating COVID-19 Zhen Zhu et al. Journal of Infection March 30, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.03.060 Purpose To evaluate the antiviral efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir versus arbidol in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Study design Retrospective cohort review (n=50 patients) Level of evidence4 Methods Fifty patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 were divided into two groups: lopinavir/ritona - vir group (n=34) and arbidol group (n=16). All patients received standard treatments of oxygen supplementation and inhalation of recombinant human interferon-alpha2b. Patients who were in the lopinavir/ritonavir group (n=34) received a 400 mg/100 mg regimen twice daily for 1 week. Pa - tients who were in the arbidol group (n=16) received 0.2 g three times daily for 1 week. Outcomes measured included duration of fever in days, various laboratory markers including LFTs, CRP , WBCs, D-dimer, CT findings of pneumonia and days testing positive for COVID-19 RNA were recorded and analyzed. Findings There was no statistically significant difference in duration of fever, which lasted < 7 days in both groups, ALT, WBC count, and D-dimer. The lopinavir/ritonavir group had statistically significant higher CRP values and neutrophils than the arbidol group in addition to statistically significant lower lymphocyte counts. No patients across either group developed severe pneumonia or ARDS. On day 7 of admission, 50% of patients in the arbidol group had undetectable COVID-19 viral loads compared to 23.5% of patients in the lopinavir/ritonavir group. On day 14, viral load was unde - tectable in all patients in the arbidol group whereas viral RNA was detected in 44.1% of patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. Furthermore, total duration of positive COVID-19 RNA testing in days was shorter to a statistically significant degree in the arbidol group compared to the lopina - vir/ritonavir group. No apparent side effects were found in both groups. Clinical ImplicationsThe arbidol monotherapy regimen was superior to the lopinavir/ritonavir regimen in the treatment of COVID-19. A previous study from China suggested that arbidol combined lopina - vir/ritonavir was superior to the lopinavir/ritonavir alone, and so this study suggests that arbidol monotherapy may be sufficient for the treatment of COVID-19. Limitations This study was a retrospective cohort review without randomization. Furthermore, there was a size discrepancy between the two groups such that there was more than double the number of patients in the lopinavir/ritonavir group compared to the arbidol monotherapy group. This limits the power of the findings associated with the arbidol monotherapy group. Additionally, there was no mention of specific inclusion or exclusion criteria for patients in this study, such as comorbid - ities or other medications the patients take on a regular basis. Lastly, all patients seemed to have mild disease, as none of the 50 patients in the study had severe pneumonia or ARDS. This limits the generalizability of these findings to other populations of COVID-19 patients with more severe disease.TREATMENTReview by Demetrios Geanon, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubA Trial of Lopinavir-Ritonavir in Adults Hospitalized with Severe Covid-19 Bin Cao et al. New England Journal of Medicine March 18, 2020 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2001282 Purpose Determine the efficacy of Lopinavir-Ritonavir treatment in confirmed SARS-CoV2 infected patients in decreasing time to clinical improvement. Study design Open label, randomized control trial. (N=199) Level of evidenceLevel 2 Methods 189 patients were randomly assigned to receive either Lopinavir-Ritonavir (400mg and 100mg) orally or via a nasogastric tube plus standard care; or standard care alone for 14 days. The primary endpoint was time to clinical improvement. Findings Patients assigned to receive Lopinavir-Ritonavir treatment did not have a time to clinical improvement different from that of standard-care group. The 28-day mortality was numerically lower in the Lopinavir-Ritonavir treatment group as compared to the standard-care group (19.2% vs 25% difference).The percentage of patients with clinical improvement on day 14 was higher in the Lopinavir-Ritonavir treatment group (45.5% vs 30%). Secondary findings included the percentage of patients with clinical improvement on day 14 was higher in the Lopinavir-Ritonavir treatment group (45.5% vs 30%) and detectable viral RNA at various time points was similar in both groups on subsequent sampling days. Clinical ImplicationsA 14-day Lopinavir-Ritonavir (400mg-100mg) therapy does not have a time to clinical improvement different from that of patients assigned to standard-of-care alone. Gastrointestinal adverse events (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) were more common in the Lopinavir-Ritonavir treatment group. The side effect profile ob - served in this study increases concern that a lengthened course of treatment or a higher dose regimen to improve outcomes might not be feasible. Limitations Based on the emergency nature of the trial, placebos were not prepared, thus limiting the ability to blind the participants and researchers. The characteristics of the patients were generally balanced but there was a slightly higher throat viral load in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, raising the possibility that this group has more viral replication, influencing clinical outcomes. Additionally, some patients received additional pharmacological interventions, such as glucocorticoid treat - ment, which might have acted as a cofounder.TREATMENTReview by Ashley Wehrheim, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubClinical Efficacy of Lopinavir/Ritonavir in the Treatment of Coronavi - rus Disease 2019 Xiaoting Y e et al. European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences March 2020 DOI: 10.26355/eurrev_202003_20706 Purpose To investigate whether lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/R) in combination with pneumonia-asso - ciated adjuvant drugs has therapeutic benefits when compared to pneumonia-associated adjuvant treatment alone in the context of COVID-19. Study design Retrospective cohort study (n=47) Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods 47 COVID-19 positive patients (via quantitative PCR) admitted to the same hospital in Rui'an, China were divided into a test group (n=42) or a control group (n=5). The test group consisted of patients treated with LPV/R in addition to pneumonia-associated ad - juvant drugs (therapeutic scheme including other antivirals and anti-inflammatory med - ications) during hospitalization. The control group included patients treated with pneu - monia-associated adjuvant drugs alone. Body temperature and laboratory values were measured three times over a ten-day period. The primary endpoint was improvement of clinical symptoms, as measured by fever. Secondary endpoints included improvement in laboratory findings, as measured by blood routine indexes, and the hepatic safety of LPV/R. Findings Patients in the test group returned to normal body temperature in a shorter time than the control group (P=0.036). Patients in the test group were also found to have generally lower levels of abnormal proportions of WBC, lymphocytes, CRP , and PLT after three treatments than that in the control group. The number of patients with abnormal AST/ALT measure - ments in the test group was not significantly increased as compared to the control group, suggesting that LPV/R does not cause significant hepatotoxicity. Clinical ImplicationsThese findings suggest that LPV/R is safe for clinical use and may demonstrate efficacy in treating COVID-19 when used with adjuvant drugs . Limitations Large age range of patients from 5-68 years of age. The control group was small (n=5) and mostly female (n=4). Patients in both the test group and the control group received vari - ous pneumonia-associated adjuvant drugs. Therefore, results of this study demonstrating the efficacy of LPV/R may be dependent on simultaneously receiving the same therapeu - tic regimen used in these patients. Additionally, as this was a retrospective cohort study, further randomized double-blinded clinical trials are needed.TREATMENTReview by Manvita Tatavarthy, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubTreatment of 5 Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19 With Convales - cent Plasma Chenguang Shen et al.

Findings Following plasma transfusion, body temperature normalized within 3 days in 4 of 5 patients, the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score de - creased, and Pao2/Fio2 increased within 12 days. Viral loads decreased and became negative within 12 days after the transfusion, and SARS-CoV-2- specific ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers increased. ARDS resolved in 4 patients at 12 days after transfusion, and 3 patients were weaned from mechan - ical ventilation within 2 weeks of treatment. At the end of the study, 3 patients were discharged from the hospital and 2 were in stable condition. Clinical ImplicationsAdministration of convalescent plasma with neutralizing antibody lead to im - provement in the patients' clinical status. The limited sample size and study design do not allow for a conclusive statement about the potential effectiveness of plasma transfusion therapy. Limitations The study was limited by its small sample size and study design that included no controls. It is unclear if patients would have had the same outcome without transfusion of plasma especially since they previously were treated with other agents. The transfusions were also given 10-22 days after admission, so the tim - ing and association of outcomes is unknown.TREATMENTReview by Amanda Narkis, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubThe feasibility of convalescent plasma therapy in severe COVID- 19 patients: a pilot study Kai Duan et al. medRxiv March 23, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036145 Purpose To examine the feasibility of providing convalescent plasma (CP) as a poten - tial therapy for patients who have tested positive for COVID-19. Study design Safety trial (n=10) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Ten patients in three Chinese hospitals who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 (by rRT-PCT) and found to be in respiratory distress were identified. Convalescent plasma was donated by patients at the same three hospitals who met criteria for recovery from COVID-19. 200mL convalescent plasma was prepared and transfused according to WHO transfusion protocol. The first study endpoint was evaluating the safety of convalescent plasma trans - fusion. The second endpoint was improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within three days of transfusion. Findings There were no serious adverse events in all ten patients. All ten patients in the study experienced an improvement in clinical symptoms within one to three days of transfusion. Furthermore, all ten patients also demonstrated negative RT-PCR testing, increased oxygen saturation, and improved lympho - cyte counts, CRP and liver function. Neutralizing antibody levels, compared to those prior to transfusion, increased in five patients, remained the same in four patients and were not measured in one. All ten patients showed varia - tion in reduction of lesions on chest CT after transfusion. Clinical ImplicationsThese findings suggest that CP appears safe in a small number of patients. Additionally, CP may improve clinical outcomes. Limitations Prior to transfusion of CP , patients received varying therapeutic regimens. Some received antivirals, whereas others only supportive care. This lack of standardization of treatment protocol confounds the assessment of the po - tential benefits of CP alone. Furthermore, the small sample size and lack of a control group, limit the power and subsequent observations of this study.

Study design Case Observational Study (n= 3) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Three patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, severe type and administered high-dose IVIg (at 0.3-0.5 g/kg) for 5 days. Computed tomography (CT) scan was documented before and after treatment. All patients were treated at the early stage of clinical deterioration. Testing for COVID-19 was performed through PCR or oropharyngeal swab. Findings Of the 3 patients, all demonstrated clinical improvement shortly after administration of high dose IVIg . Variables measured include stabilizing tem - perature within 1-2 days and breathing difficulty alleviated in 3-5 days. CT scans compared before and after treatment demonstrated partial to complete resolu - tion of lesions. Between 5-6 days after the first dose of treatment, all 3 pa - tients tested negative for COVID-19. No adverse outcomes were reported in any of the 3 patients. Clinical ImplicationsIVIg used early in a patients course after diagnosis with the severe type of COVID-19 could provide clinical use in shortening the duration of symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia. However, the clinical results require confirmation from a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The study describes 3 clinically rele - vant phases of COVID-19 including an initial phase, an accelerating phase with potential for an overall inflammatory storm (lab values indicating progressive lymphocytopenia and inflammatory markers) and a recovery phase. Limitations The study was limited by its small sample size (n=3) and lack of control cases. Additionally, confounding factors between patients include the use of lopinavir/ ritonavir in one patient and moxifloxacin in a one patient and a short course of steroids in the third patient.TREATMENTReview by Karina Oelerich, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubUse of convalescent plasma therapy in two COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome in Korea Jin Y oung Ahn et al. J Korean Med Sci April 13, 2020 DOI: 10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e149 Purpose To describe outcomes of convalescent plasma therapy in acute respiratory distress (ARDS) in two patients. Study design Uncontrolled Case Series (n=2) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Both patients received hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir after initial diagnosis of COVID-19, both progressed to ARDS, and required mechanical ventilation. The patients then received convalescent plasma from donors in their 20s, positive for ELISA IgG test for SARS- CoV-2, with previous presentation of bilateral pneumonia. The donors were determined to have completely recovered. Plasma was divided into two doses and administered at 12-hour intervals with each dose given over course of 1 hour. Both cases involved simultaneous infu - sion of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids were not given initially (due to the lack of evidence of its clinical efficacy on mortality reduction) but applied when the patients' condition dete - riorated to ARDS (methylprednisolone was administered one day and two days before the plasma infusion to patient 1 and 2, respectively). Findings Patient 1 : Previously healthy 71-year-old male -Day 9 of hospitalization (Day 22 of symptom onset), received convalescent plasma. -Day 11, patient's condition improved with fever subsiding, decreased oxygen demand and CRP . Radiograph showed resolution of lung infiltrate. Patient was weaned from ventilator. Patient 2 : 67-year-old woman with history of hypertension -Day 4, patient was intubated due to increased oxygen demand with intravenous methyl - prednisolone added and was put into prone position to improve oxygen demand. -Day 6, convalescent plasma was provided. -Day 9, density of bilateral infiltration improved along with decreased CRP and IL-6 levels. -Day 20, negative rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. -Day 24, patient was extubated and discharged. Clinical ImplicationsTransfusion of convalescent plasma shows promise for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients. Following the infusion of convalescent plasma, viral loads rapidly decrease, inflam - matory makers decrease, and oxygenation improves. Limitations This describes only two patients with similar clinical presentations of ARDS and similar treat - ment regimens, preventing generalizability to a diverse patient population. Additionally, the timing of administration of plasma varied greatly, and the antibodies provided in the plasma could not be determined if they had high neutralizing titers.TREATMENTReview by Christina Brown, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubEffectiveness of convalescent plasma therapy in severe COVID-19 patients Kai Duan et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci March 18, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004168117 Purpose To determine the safety of convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion in patients with COVID-19 and to observe the improvement of clinical symptoms, radiologic findings and laboratory parameters within 3 days after CP transfusion. Study design Prospective Cohort Study (n=10) Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Ten COVID-19 patients (confirmed by real-time viral RNA test) in severe condition re - ceived one dose of 200 mL of CP derived from recently recovered donors (titers>1:640) transfused ~16.5 days after development of symptoms. CP was given in addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral treatments. Severe classification was defined as patients presenting with severe dyspnea, respiratory distress (tachypnea>30 breaths/ min), or hypoxia (SpO2<90%). A historic control group was formed by random se - lection of 10 patients treated in the same hospital and matched by age, gender, and severity of the diseases. Findings Chest CTs showed improvement in different degrees of absorption of pulmonary le - sions after CP transfusion in all patients. Lymphocytopenia and SaO2 increased where - as C-reactive aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotrans (ALT) decreased. An increase in neutralizing antibody titers was found in 5/10 patients, viral load was decreased to an undetectable level in 3/10 patients. Clinical outcome in the CP group improved as compared to the control group. In the CP group, three cases discharged, while the remaining seven cases were given a \"much improved status\" and were ready for discharge. In the control group, there were three deaths, six cases were classified as \"stabilized\" , and one case classified as \"much improved status\" . No serious adverse reactions or safety events were recorded after CP transfusion. Clinical ImplicationsOne dose of CP with high concentration of neutralizing antibodies can rapidly reduce the viral load and tends to improve clinical outcomes with minimal adverse reactions. Limitations First, patients received additional treatment beyond CP , which may have contributed to clinical outcomes. Additionally, this study had a small sample size and was unblind - ed, increasing risk of bias. Finally, some patients received glucocorticoid therapy, which could interfere with the immune response and delay virus clearance, altering study findings.TREATMENTReview by Ashley Wehrheim, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubTreatment With Convalescent Plasma for Critically Ill Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Infection Bin Zhang et al.

Patient was dis - charged. - Case 2: The patient's PO2/OI increased from 50/135mmHg to 97/198mmHg, one day following plasma transfusion. CT scans indicated absorption of pneumonia and RT-PCR test results were negative. Patient was discharged. - Case 3: The patient tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and had decreased serum IgM. CT scans showed absorbed infiltrative lesions and RT-PCR tests of spu - tum in deep lungs were negative. Patient was transferred to the unfenced ICU for further treatment of underlying diseases and multiple organ failure. - Case 4: The patient's anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM tested negative while IgG levels were positive. CT scan showed absorption of opacities and RT-PCR tests were negative. Patient was discharged. Clinical ImplicationsConvalescent plasma therapy may prove to be beneficial as a last resort treatment for severely ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. No serious adverse reactions were observed in these 4 patients associated with the transfusion of convalescent plasma. Limitations The relative benefits of supportive care, medications, and the patient's immune response could not be determined. Whether convalescent plasma can provide any clinical benefit must still be tested by randomized control trial.TREATMENTReview by Sarah Sun, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubConvalescent plasma transfusion for the treatment of COVID-19: Systematic review Karthick Rajendran et al. Journal of Medical Virology May 1, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25961 Purpose To determine the efficacy of convalescent plasma transfusion (CPT) therapy on COVID-19 patients. Study design Systematic Review Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods A systematic search was conducted using electronic databases such as PubMed, EMBASE and Medline to identify case studies and clincial trials regarding treatment of COVID-19 patients using CPT therapy. Studies were published literature between December 1, 2019 to April 19, 2020. \"Convalescent plasma AND COVID-19\" was used as the search term and there were no restrictions placed on the comparator in each study. The primary endpoints were clinical effects, survival benefits, viral load & antibody titer status and adverse events. Two authors independently assessed the studies to reduce the risk of bias. Findings Amongst all 8 of the studies reviewed, 5 were selected for further evaluation. These 5 stud - ies had a total of 27 patients enrolled that received the CPT therapy. All the patients re - ceived CPT between Day 6 and Day 50, however, it varied between the studies the dosage administered and the length of treatment. All 5 studies found zero mortality rate for patients that had CPT administrated , albeit it being in varying doses. Every study also found that CPT, in conjunction with other antiviral treatments, reduced the viral load and increased the level of neutralizing antibody titer. Every single patient had also received more than one antiviral drug in addition to the CPT. Almost all patients also showed im - provement of their symptoms such as their body temperature. Furthermore, CPT treat - ment was well tolerated by all the patients and no adverse reactions were noted. Clinical ImplicationsAlthough there is limited scientific data, it appears that COVID-19 patients treated with CPT treatment have positive outcomes. Further randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to determine the ideal dosage and treatment time for CPT therapy for optimal outcomes. Limitations The included studies were predominantly case reports or case series and lacked proper control groups. It is also difficult to determine that CPT alone reduced the viral load and increased antibody titers because all patients were given multiple therapies. Additionally, the authors did not compare different doses of CPT with outcomes, making it difficult to understand what dose might be most effective.

The Lancet April 29, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31022-9 Purpose To determine the effect of Remdesivir on time to clinical improvement in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Study design Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial at ten hospitals in Hubei, China Level of evidence2 Methods Patients admitted with severe cases of confirmed COVID-10 were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio of IV Remdesivir (200mg on day 1 followed by 100mg on days 2-10 with a single daily infection) or the same volume of placebo infusions for 10 days. Patients received concomitant use of lopinavir-ritonavir, interferons and corticosteroids. The primary end - point of this study was time to clinical improvement within 28 days after randomization. This was defined as the time in days from randomization to a decline of two levels on a six- point ordinal scale (1= discharged, 6=death), or discharge alive from the hospital, which - ever came first. Findings - Remdesivir use was not associated with a statistically significant difference in time to clinical improvement compared to the control population. - Although not statistically significant, patients receiving Remdesivir had a numerical - ly faster time to clinical improvement compared to those receiving placebo among patients with symptom duration of <10 days. - Adverse events were reported in (66%) Remdesivir patients and (64%) of patients who received the placebo. More patients in the group discontinued the study due to severe adverse events (12% in Remdesivir group vs 5% in placebo group) Clinical Implications- In Adult patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19, Remdesivir was not associated with statically significant clinical benefits beyond those receiving the standard of care. - The higher rate of adverse events observed in the Remdesivir group increases concern that a lengthened course of treatment or a higher dose regimen to improve outcomes might not be feasible Limitations The study did not reach its target enrollment, leading to insufficient power to detect dif - ference in clinical outcomes. Additionally, restrictions on hospital bed availability result - ed in most patients being enrolled later in the course of disease, so research could not adequately assess whether earlier Remdesivir treatment might have provided additional clinical benefit.

New England Journal of Medicine April 10, 2020 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2007016 Purpose To determine the clinical outcome of compassionate use Remdesivir (inhibits viral RNA polymerases) in the treatment of Covid-19 infection, caused by the SARS- CoV-2. Study design Open-label clinical trial (n = 53) Level of evidence3 Methods It is a multicenter study conducted at sites in United States, Japan, Italy, Austria, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, and Canada. PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection defined as oxygen saturation of 94% or less while on ambient air or ox - ygen support. Participants needed a creatinine clearance greater than 30 ml/min and liver enzymes (alanine transaminase, ALT and aspartate transaminase, AST) 5 times below the upper limit of normal. The duration of Remdesivir therapy is 10 days, consisting of 200 mg administered intravenously on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for the remaining 9 days of treatment. The main outcomes were discharge or death. Findings During a median follow-up of 18 days, 36 (68%) of the patients improved clinically. Seven (13%) died after at the end of Remdesivir treatment. A total of 32 patients reported adverse events mostly elevated liver function tests (LFTs), rash, diarrhea, hypotension, and renal impairment, worse with those on invasive ventila - tion. Clinical Implications68% of patients diagnosed with severe Covid-19 improved with the use of Rem - desivir. Therefore, compassionate use of the medication is clinically valuable in the management of severe Covid-19 infection. Limitations Most of the study participants (75%) were men ranging between 23 to 82 years, which may introduce gender bias. The small sample size and non-randomization of participants, missing data were limitations in the data interpretation and results. There were no clearly stated inclusion and exclusion criteria. Even though compas - sionate use of the medication should be investigated for efficacy, it is difficult to draw useful conclusions from uncontrolled studies like this.TREATMENTReview by Ayesan Rewane, MSCR Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubCase reports study of the first five patients COVID-19 treated with Remdesivir in France Marie Dubert et al. International Journal of Infectious Diseases June 30, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.06.093 Purpose To evaluate the efficacy of Remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 in patients in France. Study design Case Series (n=5) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Data was collected from five COVID-19 patients (all male, ages 31, 39, 70, 76 and 80) admitted to the ICU for severe pneumonia, all of whom were treated with Remde - sivir, at the University Hospital of Bichat in Paris, France. Patients received IV Remde - sivir with a loading dose of 200mg, followed by a maintenance daily dose of 100mg for 14 days. SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR was monitored in nasopharyngeal and bronchoal - veolar samples collected from patients. Findings Four out of five patients (80%) had a significant decrease in SARS-CoV-2 in naso - pharyngeal viral load after treatment. However, two patients (40%) died with active SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lower respiratory tract. Remdesivir had to be interrupt - ed in 4 out of 5 patients due to side effects, such as alamine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation (2/5; 40%) and kidney failure (2/5; 40%). Clinical ImplicationsResults suggest that Remdesivir may lower viral load in the upper respiratory tract. For treating acutely ill patients who may have co-morbidities of renal and hepatic function, clinicians should be mindful of hepatic and kidney function monitoring when administrating this treatment. Limitations The small sample size of this study limits the generalizability of the findings. This study was a case series rather than a controlled trial, making it difficult to deter - mine the efficacy of Remdesivir and also whether it was Remdesivir or the SARS- CoV-2 virus that was responsible for kidney failure and ALT elevation in patients. Further studies are necessary to assess the efficacy of Remdesivir against SARS- CoV-2. In the meantime, alternative novel therapies will be needed to control dis - ease progression in severely ill patients.TREATMENTReview by Carter Do, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubTocilizumab treatment in COVID19: A single center experience. Pan Luo et al. Journal of Medical Virology April 6, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25801 Purpose To analyze the treatment responses of Tocilizumab (TCZ), a monoclonal an - tibody against interleukin-6 (IL-6) in COVID-19 infected patients and provide guidance for future use. Study design Retrospective Observational (n=15) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods The demographic, treatment, laboratory parameters of Creactive protein (CRP) and IL6 before and after TCZ therapy and clinical outcomes within 1 week of treatment in 15 COVID19 patients were obtained from medical re - cords and analyzed. CRP was defined as elevated when higher than 5.0 mg/L and IL-6 was if higher than 7.0 pg/mL. Findings CRP levels were all far above normal before treatment and improved rapidly in all patients (126.9 to 11.2 mg/L; P<0.01 ). Although of the four critically ill patients who received a single dose of TCZ, three died and the other patient's CRP level failed to return to the normal range. Serum IL-6 lev - els initially spiked but decreased after TCZ therapy in 10 patients. There was a persistent and dramatic increase of IL-6 in the four patients that failed treatment. One patient also had a clinical outcome of aggravation. Clinical ImplicationsOverall, TCZ appears to be a possible effective treatment option in relieving inflammatory activity in COVID-19 patients with a risk of cytokine storms. In most patients, acute phase reactant levels were decreased after TCZ adminis - tration. It is reacommended that critically ill patients with elevated IL-6 levels receive a repeated dose of TCZ since a single dose of TCZ failed to improve disease activity in critically ill patients although used in combination with glucocorticoid. Limitations The study was limited by its small sample size and not being compared to control subjects. It is also difficult to know which lab parameters are optimal in defining disease activity of COVID-19. It is unclear if outside factors such as comorbidities and age may have played a role in the study outcomes.TREATMENTReview by Amanda Narkis, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubEffective Treatment of Severe COVID-19 Patients with Tocilizumab Xiaoling Xu et al. ChinaXiv April 14, 2020 DOI: 10.12074/202003.00026 Purpose To assess the efficacy of Tocilizumab in severe patients with COVID-19. Study design Case Series (n=21) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Patients diagnosed as severe or critical COVID-19 were given tocilizumab (400 mg once through IV Drip) in addition to routine therapy between February 5, 2020 -February 14, 2020. Changes in clinical manifestations (Body temp., Oxygen saturations etc), CT scan images (performed on admission and 1 week after receiving therapy), and laboratory examinations were retrospectively analyzed. Findings Within a few days, the fever returned to normal and all other symptoms im - proved remarkably . 75% of patients had lowered their oxygen intake and one patient no longer needed Oxygen therapy. CT scan manifested that the lung lesion opacity absorbed in 90.5% of patients. The percentage of lymphocytes in peripheral blood decreased in 85% of patients before treatment, returned to normal in 52.5% of pa - tients on Day 5 of treatment. Abnormally elevated C-reactive protein decreased sig - nificantly in 84.2% of patients. No obvious adverse reactions were observed during the duration of treatment. 90.5% of patients were discharged an average of 13.5 days after treatment with tocilizumab and the rest were recovering well at the end of the trial period. Clinical ImplicationsClinical data showed that symptoms, hypoxemia and CT opacity changes were im - proved immediately after treatment with tocilizumab in most patients. - Tocilizumab is hypothesized to be an effective treatment in severe patients of COVID-19, which may provide a new therapeutic strategy for severe patients, but larg - er randomized trials must be performed. Limitations The number of patients were rather limited and no control group was included. This was a single observation study and significant bias could possibly exist. The patients received standard of care treatment (lopinavir, methylprednisolone, other symptom relivers and oxygen therapy) in addition to Tocilizumab. As a result, the possibility that these agents could have contributed to positive clinical outcomes cannot be ruled out.TREATMENTReview by Ashley Wehrheim, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubOff-label use of Tocilizumab in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection Simona Di Giambenedetto et al.

Study design Case Series (n=3) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods The study followed Chinese and Italian guidelines, which support the use of tocili - zumab (at the dosage of 8 mg/kg, with a second dose 12 hours after the first and a possible third dose after further 24-36 hours, according to clinical response), in case of rapid clinical and/or radiological worsening and exclude contraindications to the use of this medication (transaminases levels> 5 times the upper limit of normal, neutrophils count<500 cells/\u00b5L, platelets count< 50,000 complicated diverticulitis/intestinal perforation, cutaneous infection, immunosuppressive anti-rejection therapy). Findings The article describes the outcomes of 3 patients aged 71, 45 and 53 years old who were hospitalized in a Level III Italian Hospital following the diagnosis of COVID-19 and developing rapidly worsening respiratory insufficiency. They were all prescribed tocilizumab when their respiratory symptoms worsened despite standard therapy. Rapid relief of respiratory symptoms, resolution of fever and reduction in CRP were the first effects noted following tocilizumab administration in all three patients with - in 48-72 hours. Of note, no adverse events were registered during the follow-up of the three patients. Clinical ImplicationsThese observations highlight the efficacy of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19 even after a short time. Tocilizumab may represent an effective option in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2- infected patients with severe pneumonia, and randomized trials should be started soon. Limitations There was a small number of subjects, a lack of controlled randomized trial, and no controlling of pre-existing conditions for patients. The route of administration for Tocilizumab was not specified.TREATMENTReview by Maria Amir, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubAcute hypertriglyceridemia in patients with COVID19 receiving tocili - zumab Austin R.

Study design Letter to Editor Level of evidenceN/A Methods This article was written in response to the Luo et al. study of Tocilizumab (TCZ) for COVID-19 in a single center in China and due to no reports of acute adverse events with TCZ treatment in COVID-19 thus far. The authors discuss two cases of acute hy - pertriglyceridemia in patients with COVID-19 treated with TCZ with one developing acute pancreatitis. Findings - Cases 1 and 2, a 65-year old-male and 43-year-old male respectively, were both in the ICU with respiratory failure and ARDS who received lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, and hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment. Both patients received TCZ due to persistent fevers, severe ARDS, and elevated inflammatory markers. Following TCZ, both cases had a significant increase in TG levels, with case 1 developing acute pan - creatitis as defined by elevated amylase and lipase levels. - Both patients received propofol prior to treatment, but the effect of propofol on increased TGs is typically seen 2.25-7 days after starting therapy, with normalization occurring within 72 hours. Therefore, patients receiving TCZ and propofol may re - quire more frequent monitoring. - Membrane-bound soluble IL-6 receptor inhibition with TCZ administration may result in increased triglyceride levels by interfering with the metabolic pathways of IL-6, but exact mechanisms are unknown Clinical ImplicationsClinicians should consider monitoring for hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis for those receiving TCZ treatment for severe COVID-19 as well as to remain vigilant for other acute adverse effects that are difficult to detect in small sample clinical trials. Limitations The article only discusses two cases of hypertriglyceridemia, and both patients re - ceived other treatments for COVID-19 prior to TCZ. Further data collection is needed to determine the true relationship between increased TG levels and TCZ treatment in COVID-19.

Study design Retrospective Review (n=25) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods The study completed a retrospective chart review of patients in Qatar with laboratory con - firmed severe COVID-19 that received TCZ for 14 days and followed from day 1 through 14. The primary outcome was discharge from the ICU by day 14. Twenty-five patients were eligible; these patients had a median age of 58 years old, median BMI of 29 kg/m2, and the majority were male (92%). Findings - The decline in temperature and serum CRP levels are likely a reflection of TCZ's immune modulating effect. Median oral temperatures on day 1, day 3 and day 7 were 38.0\u00b0C, 37.3\u00b0C (P 0.043) and 37.0\u00b0C (P 0.064), respectively, while median CRP 193 7.9 mg/L (P <0.0001) and <6 mg/L (P 0.0001). - At the time of TCZ administration, 84% of patients were on invasive ventilation, which declined to 60% on day 7 (P 0.031) and 28% on day 14 (p 0.001). There was radiological improvement on patient's chest x-rays for 44% of patients by day 7 and 68% by day 14. - Nine patients (36%) were discharged alive from the ICU and three (12%) died. Since the median age of the patients was 58, it is possible this played a role in the low mortality, since older age has been found to be associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes. - The majority (92%) of patients experienced at least one adverse event. However, patients were critically ill and received other investigational antiviral therapies, so it is difficult to conclude if any were specifically due to TCZ. Clinical ImplicationsPatients with severe COVID-19 that were treated with TCZ had a dramatic decline in inflammatory markers, radiological improvement, and reduced ventilatory support requirements. Limitations Limitations in this study include it being retrospective, lack of a control comparison, and potential confounding effects from concomitant investigational antivirals. Further ran - domized controlled trials are necessary to conclude effectiveness of TCZ treatment.TREATMENTReview by Amanda Narkis, ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubTocilizumab for Treatment of Severe COVID-19 Patients: Preliminary Results from SMAtteo COvid19 REgistry (SMACORE) Marta Colaneri et al.

Study design Retrospective analysis of matched cases (n=21 matched pairs) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Patient data from the SMAtteo COvid19 REgistry (SMACORE) database was collected on 112 patients hospitalized between March 14-27, 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Retrospective analysis via linear regression and generalized linear mixed models were per - formed on 21 matched pairs of patients receiving either standard of care (SOC) (hydroxychlo - roquine (HCQ): 200 mg BID, azithromycin: 500 mg once, low weight heparin, methylprednis - olone: tapered dose of 1 mg/kg up to a maximum of 80 mg for 10 days) or SOC + TCZ (8 mg/ kg IV, capped at 800, repeated 12 hours later). Patients in the SOC + TCZ treatment group were required to meet certain laboratory protein [CRP] U/L). Pairs were matched based on propensity scores calculated from demographic and clinical variables. Primary outcomes included 7 day mortali - ty and ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included CRP , international normalized ratio (INR), lymphocyte and neutrophil counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and ALT. Findings Treatment with TCZ did not significantly affect likelihood of ICU admission (odds ratio, OR: 0.11) or 7 day mortality (OR: 0.78) when compared to patients receiving SOC. TCZ treatment was correlated with a significant down trend in CRP and INR, an uptrend in ALT, and stable platelet counts. TCZ was not associated with significant hepatotoxicity or secondary infection. Clinical ImplicationsPreliminary data suggest that TCZ does not have a profound impact on COVID-19 patient mor - tality or ICU admission when compared to SOC (combination of HCQ, heparin, azithromycin, and methylprednisolone). TCZ is associated with up trending ALT levels and should be used with caution in those with increased potential for severe liver injury. Further data is required to determine utility of TCZ in this clinical context. Limitations This study was observational, involved a short follow up period, and included a relatively small sample size. As an observational study, analysis is subject to bias, although attempts were made to limit this through propensity score matching.

Study design Observational comparison study Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods 31 patients with COVID-19 were drawn from two designated hospitals in Wuhu, China. Re - cords were reviewed of patients admitted between January 24th and February 24th, 2020 with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by local health agencies using RT-PCR. Patients who received at least one dose of corticosteroids within 24 hours of admittance were com - pared against those who did not receive any. The primary outcome was time to clearance of the virus, whereas secondary outcomes were duration of clinical recovery, and length of hospital stay. Patients were followed until February 29th, 2020. Those patients who received corticosteroids within 24 hours of arrival were compared against patients not-re - ceiving corticosteroids. All patients received standard therapies. Findings Eleven patients received corticosteroids (40 mg methylprednisolone) once or twice per day for a median of 5 days. The patients receiving steroids had a higher maximum tem - perature on admission (38.8\u00b0C vs 37.8\u00b0C, P=0.002), symptoms including myalgia or fa - 40%, P=0.004) and (91% vs (84.0 vs 18.7 mg/L, and lower median lymphocyte count (0.99 vs 1.54\u00d71e9/L, P=0.012). However, no significant difference in virologic and clinical outcomes was seen between the corticosteroid and control groups. This suggests there is no additional bene - fit to use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients who are not in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There was an unplanned association found between prolonged viral clearance and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (mean difference: 10.6 days, P<0.001). How - ever, this study is underpowered to detect a true association. Clinical ImplicationsEarly dosing of corticosteroids may not be indicated in patients presenting with mild COVID-19 and may not improve health outcomes or hospital length-of-stay. Therefore, corticosteroids should be avoided unless indicated for other reasons. Limitations The sample size was only 31 patients. It is not apparent what the inclusion and exclusion criteria were. Overall, the study population is younger (average age of 39) and all had a mild disease at presentation. The study is observational; trial and control groups were not randomized.

Dean et al. New England Journal of Medicine April 2, 2020 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMsb1905390 Purpose To address some of the challenges faced when conducting clinical trials during pandemics and proffer important recommendations. Study design Review Level of evidenceN/A Methods This article closely observed the trends of two major randomized trials during the Ebola epidemic: The Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia (PREVAIL) and Investigational Therapeutics for the Treatment of People with Ebola Virus Dis - ease (PALM) conducted in Liberia and Congo (DRC). Findings Authors call for the implementation of a generalized protocol, which would serve as a reliable model across multiple infectious disease outbreaks. The details are as below: All clinical trials should be published regardless of the results or clinical out - comes as clearly stated in the Declaration of Helsinki. This serves to eliminate publi - cation bias. Inconclusive results are useful to support the evidence of the safety and efficacy of the agent under investigation. The PREVAIL study using ZMapp did not show a clear efficacy, but ZMapp was the control used in the PALM trials. A Core or Master Protocol is being proposed to regulate the conduct of clinical trials during pandemics. Specifically, this proposal focuses on diseases that occur irregularly, yet still relatively frequently, like Ebola. Efficacy data should not be released from trials that have not been completed due to insufficient enrollment. In these cases, an in - dependent monitoring team can use interim results to make recommendations on whether or not the trial should continue, but the investigators would not be made aware of the results of these analyses. Clinical ImplicationsCommon challenges of conducting clinical trials during an outbreak include unpre - dictable sample size, duration of outbreaks and geographic location. Regardless of the outcome of these clinical trials, they all provide important information to deter - mine treatment and evaluate potential vaccines for emerging diseases only if they are designed under a \"core protocol\" , which meets the conventional standards for licensure and is applicable to various infectious disease outbreaks. Limitations The conclusions of this review were drawn mostly from smaller scale disease out - breaks and failed to compare the conduction of clinical trials during pandemics.TREATMENTReview by Ayesan Rewane, of so close!

Study design Systematic review Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods 117 studies on the pathophysiology of COVID-19, the risk of viral infections in RA pa - tients, and the impact of anti-rheumatic drugs on viral infections were reviewed. Findings Studies have shown that patients with RA have a significantly higher risk of serious (risk ratio, RR: 1.53) and hospitalized (RR: 1.88) infections. An analysis showed that each 0.6 unit increase in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) correlates to a 25% increased rate of infections requiring hospitalization (incident rate ratio, IRR: 1.25, P=0.03) and 4% increased rate of outpatient infections (IRR:1.04, P=0.01). Risk of serious infections increased progressively in patients with low (adjusted IRR: 1.69) to moderate (adjusted IRR: 1.30) disease activity, showing that maintaining good disease control reduces infectious complications. Anti-rheumatic drugs such as Corti - costeroids/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (CS/NSAIDs), csDMARDs, bDMARDs, and tDMARDs were studied, showing that CS has negative effects on infections like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. There are no clear benefits from CS in patients with COVID-19. The use of csDMARDs without CS showed a small decrease mild infection risk (adjusted RR: 0.90) and was not associated with increased serious infection risk (ad - justed RR: 0.92). Literature shows no increased risk of infection in patients receiving methotrexate (MTX) (RR: 1.14). RA patients taking bDMARDs have a slightly higher risk of infection (from 1.5- up to 2-fold) compared with csDMARDs. The risk of serious infec - tion in RA patients taking tDMARDs/JAK inhibitors is roughly the same as bDMARDs. Clinical ImplicationsThe use of biologic disease-modifying drugs can be associated with potential increase of serious infections. Furthermore, poor control of RA disease activity in patients has an even greater infectious risk factor. RA patients are encouraged to continue treatment during the COVID-19 outbreak to prevent bridging therapy like corticosteroids, which may increase the risk of viral infection. Limitations Further research is needed on the effects of RA on respiratory viral infections like SARS- CoV-2.TREATMENTReview by Danesha Lewis, PhD student Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubTraditional Chinese and Western medicines jointly beat COVID-19 pan - demic Guang-chao Qing et al.

Findings - Indexes such as serum amyloid A, lymphocyte transaminase, and blood urea nitrogen in patients treated with combination medicine therapy recovered faster than those receiving WM alone. - Combination administration of Toujie Quwen and arbidol up-regulated the ex - pression of peripheral blood CD4+/CD8+ and lymphocyte levels in 37 cases of mild COVID-19 while treatment with arbidol alone did not. - In a comparative study on 710 cases, patients treated with Xuebijing and WM reduced the mortality rate of severe pneumonic patients by 8.8% (p=0.006). It was also found that Xuebijing injection has certain antiviral and anti-inflammatory fac - tors in vitro. Clinical ImplicationsThe outbreak of COVID-19 in China has, for the most part, been contained. The combined therapy of CM and WM may prove to be more effective and eco - nomical in combating COVD-19 than administration of either medicine alone, according to the four studies reviewed in this paper. Limitations The mechanisms and pathways through which CM and WM function together are not well-defined and require further investigation. Side effects, dosage, and drug- drug interactions should also be evaluated. There is a lack of randomized clinical trials for the proposed CMs.TREATMENTReview by Sarah Sun, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubAssociation of Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors with Severity or Risk of Death in Patients with Hypertension Hospitalized for Corona - virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Infection in Wuhan, China Juyi Li et al. JAMA Cardiology April 23, 2020 DOI: 10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1624 Purpose To determine whether patients with hypertension who are taking angiotensin-con - verting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have increased severity or risk of mortality during hospitalization for COVID-19. Study design Retrospective, single-center case series (n=1178; 362 with hypertension; 115 taking ACEI/ARBs) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Patients with COVID-19 (confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) admitted to Central Hospital of Wuhan (Hubei Province, China) from January 15, 2020 to March 15, 2020, were stratified based on the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia symptoms. Hypertension was defined as a history of blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or greater or a history of antihypertensive medica - tion use. Statistical analysis was preformed on all 1178 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to determine if there was a statistically significant difference in clinical severity or outcome for patients taking ACEIs/ARBs for their hypertension. Findings The frequency of severity of illness, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and mor - tality did not differ with respect to ACEI/ARB therapy. Similarly, the percentage of patients with hypertension taking any drug or drug combination did not differ be - tween those with severe and nonsevere infections and nonsurvivors and survivors. The findings, however, confirm data that patients with hypertension have more severe illness and higher mortality rates than those without hypertension. Clinical ImplicationsThis study shows data to support the continuation of hypertensive medication during hospitalization for COVID-19. Limitations The study was limited by a small sample size of patients with hypertension on ACEI/ ARB therapy who were hospitalized with COVID-19. In addition, the current find - ings may not be generalizable to all patient with hypertension and it is still possible that ACEIs/ARBs could affect the chance of hospitalization. It was also not certain whether ACEI/ARB treatment at baseline was maintained throughout the hospital - ization for all patients.TREATMENTReview by Eric Moyer, MS4 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubSearching therapeutic strategy of new coronavirus pneumonia from angiotensin-converting enzyme 2: the target of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV Shu-ren Li et al. European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases April 13, 2020 DOI: 10.1007/s10096-020-03883-y Purpose To summarize the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in multiple organ damage caused by COVID-19 and SARS-CoV, targeted blocking drugs against ACE2, and drugs that inhibit inflammation to provide a basis for further research, diagnosis and treatment, and drug development. Study design Review article Level of evidenceN/A Methods This article is a summary of pre-existing literature. Findings ACE2 is responsible for the degradation of angiotensin II (AngII) and it is down - regulated after viral infections. This is thought to contribute to the inflammatory response. An imbalance of the AngII signaling system is thought to play an important role in end organ damage. ACE2 is widely distributed and appears to be involved with the damage seen in various tissues (specifically cardiac, kidney, testicular, liver, and intestines). As such, cardiac damage is a concern in high-risk groups with COVID-19. Due to the potential pathophysiology in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, there is the possibility for fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19. The use of ACE inhibitor in COVID-19 patients is still controversial and there are con - flicting theories surrounding whether ACEIs are beneficial or harmful in these patients . There are some small molecules on the market that target ACE2 and they have been shown to be effective at blocking SARS-CoV infection. However, the key amino acids in the SARS S protein that interact with ACE2 don't seem to be conserved in COVID-19 and there is no data to show whether these molecules are effective for COVID-19. In a study done in spontaneously hypertensive rats, a de - crease in thrombotic ACE2 activity was associated with an increase in thrombosis. Clinical ImplicationsBe aware of the potential for fecal-oral transmission, cardiac damage in high risk groups, testicular and renal involvement and abnormal coagulation in COVID-19 patients Limitations It is reasonable to believe that ACE2 plays a role in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, but the clinical significance remains to be determined.TREATMENTReview by Caleb Bailie, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubPrevention and Therapy of COVID-19 via Exogenous Estrogen Treat - ment for Both Male and Female Patients; An Opinion Paper Zsuzanna Suba Journal of Pharmacological Sciences April 22, 2020 DOI: 10.18433/jpps31069 Purpose To discuss the proposed efficacy of Exogenous estrogen therapy in COIVD-19.

Findings Patient demographics for COVID-19 disease (caused by SARS-Cov-2) at the time of this publication show that males more often experience disease and have higher mortality than women. Literature exists for SARS-CoV murine experiments that demonstrate an estrogen protective effect. Clinical ImplicationsThe authors speculate that exogenous estrogen treatment may be beneficial for men experiencing COVID-19 disease. Limitations The authors provide a somewhat unorthodox approach for treatment for COVID-19 disease in males. Nevertheless, prospective clinical studies might be warranted, i.e., determine the efficacy of exogenous estrogen treatment for COVID-19 disease in men.TREATMENTReview by Ashley Wehrheim, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubClinical characteristics and therapeutic procedure for four cases with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia receiving combined Chi - nese and Western medicine treatment. Zhenwei Wang et al. BioScience Trends March 16, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.5582/bst.2020.01030 Purpose To determine the efficacy of antiviral treatment, alongside traditional Chinese med - icine such as Shufeng Jiedu Capsule (SFJDC) on subjects with COVID-19 associated pneumonia. Study design Retrospective case series (n = 4) Level of evidenceLevel 4 Methods Baseline data were collected using medical records of 4 patients that were admit - ted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center in Shanghai, China. Throat swabs were obtained from the upper respiratory tract and RT-PCR was performed for COVID-19 diagnosis. All patients were also given CT or chest radiograph. Patients were diag - nosed as having COVID-19 associated pneumonia on admission and they were fol - lowed from January 21st-24th, 2020 to February 4th, 2020. All patients were treated with combined Lopinavir 400 mg/Ritonavir 100 mg, q12h, po (HIV medication), Arbidol 0.2 g, tid, po, (an antiviral treatment for influenza infection used in China and Russia) and Shufeng Jiedu Capsule 2.08 g, TID, PO (Chinese medicine used to treat influenza), for 6-15 days. Findings All patients exhibited common symptomatology and exhibited ground-glass opac - ities and consolidation were the most common radiological findings. Using the combination medication, 3 of the 4 patients showed improvement. Two of those patients tested negative for COVID-19 following treatment and were discharged. The patient with severe pneumonia was given an intubated ventilator-assisted breathing therapy, as well as human seroalbumin and y-immunoglobulin. Clinical ImplicationsThe study indicates a favorable outcome for the combined treatment; however, further verification of this method is warranted. Limitations This study was limited by its small sample size, as well as a very short clinical follow up period. The efficacy of antiviral treatment using these agents warrants further investigation. The MOA of Arbidol and SFJDC is unknown, so cannot determine drug interactions or pharmacologic implications.TREATMENTReview by Maria Amir, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubFlooded by the Torrent: The COVID-19 drug pipeline Asher Mullard Lancet April 18, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30894-1 Purpose To discuss the current state of clinical trials for COVID-19 treatments. Study design Opinion Level of evidenceN/A Methods This is an opinion piece written after interviews with researchers and medical executives. It looks at the current state of clinical trials for COVID-19 treatments and focuses on the new umbrella trial called Solidarity developed by the WHO. It also mentions other large-scale trials such as the RECOVERY trial in the UK. The key defining feature of these trials is their large scale, and multi-arm design allowing them to study multiple drugs at once across a wide population. The author posits that trials such as these or those that align their criteria and outcomes will be most beneficial in determining efficacy of new treatments. Findings Participation in large multicenter, international umbrella clinical trials, such as the WHO's Solidarity trial, should be the priority for testing treatments for COVID-19. Small case-reports and multiple individual studies with different criteria make it difficult to draw large scale conclusions about efficacy. Enrolling as many and as diverse of a population as possible with improve data collection. Organizations cre - ating their own trials should attempt to align their criteria and clinical determinants with other studies to improve generalizability and make merging of databases possible in the future. For the drug pipeline to work effectively there will also need to be coordination at the levels of manufacturing, regulation, supply and access. Clinical Implications\u00b7 Researchers considering starting their own trials should first determine if they can fit within currently active large-scale trials rather than on their own. \u00b7 Researchers conducting their own trials should review other articles and at - tempt to align their criteria to other studies underway. \u00b7 Small-scale studies and case reports may not be generalizable and may not help determine efficacy of new treatments.

Engineering March 18, 2020 DOI: 10.1016/j.eng.2020.03.007 Purpose Evaluate the effects of Favipiravir (FPV) compared to Lopinavir (LPV)/Ritonavir (RTV) for treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Study design Open-label non-randomized control study (n= 80) Level of evidence3 Methods In the experimental arm of the study, 35 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 received oral FPV (Day 1: 1600 mg 2x/day; Days 2-14 600 mg 2x/day). In the control group, 45 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were treated with LPV/RTV (Days 1-14: 400 mg/100mg 2x/day). Both groups were also treated with IFN-alpha by aerosol inhala - tion. Patients with severe clinical condition were excluded from the study. Treatment was continued with anti-viral therapy until viral clearance was attained or until 14 days had passed. The primary endpoints were time to viral clearance and the improvement rate of chest computed tomography (CT) scans on Day 14 after treatment. Findings The median time of viral clearance (Kaplan-Meier survival curves) for patients treated with FPV was 4 days compared to patients treated with LPV/RTV, which was 11 days. After con - trolling for confounding factors, antiviral therapy when comparing FPV to LPV/RTV had a Hazard Ratio = 3.434 and 95% Confidence Interval = 1.162-10.148 demonstrating that FPV had a greater effect on viral clearance. Patients treated with FPV had a greater im - provement rate in CT on day 14 after treatment compared to the control arm of the study (91.4% compared to 62.2%, P=.004) In the FPV treated group, 4 patients (11.43%) expe - rienced adverse reactions (diarrhea, liver injury and poor diet). In the group treated with LPV/RTV, 25 patients (55.56%) experienced adverse reactions (diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, rash, liver injury, chest tightness and palpitations). Clinical Implications-Both CT imaging and time to viral clearance showed greater improvement in pa - tients treated with RPV compared to LPV/RTV, demonstrating better treatment outcomes in the FPV group. -These clinical results should be confirmed with a Randomized Control Trial (RCT), to bet - ter understand both the adverse effects of each medication as well as their clinical efficacy. Limitations The study was limited by a small sample size, inherent selection bias in patient recruitment and a lack of randomization. Because patients with severe clinical condition were exclud - ed from the study, the results may be less applicable to any patients with a more severe clinical course.TREATMENTReview by Karina Oelerich, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubA SARS-CoV2 Protein Interaction Map reveals targets for drug repur - posing David E. Gordon et al. Nature April 30, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2286-9 Purpose To identify potential human proteins or host factors associated with CoV-2 that can be target - ed by drug therapy. Study design Laboratory study Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods Researchers aimed to identify potential COVID-19 therapeutic targets by systematically ex - ploring the host dependencies of the SARS-CoV2 virus to identify other host proteins already targeted by existing drugs. This was done by systemically mapping the interaction landscape between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins by identifying PPI's (SARS-COV-2 Human Protein-Protein Interactions). Two in vitro viral assays were used to test antiviral activity of the selected drugs. Findings -Identified 332 high confidence SARS-Cov-2 human PPIs connected to multiple biologic pro - cesses, including protein tracking, translation, transcription and ubiquitination. -Against the 332 targets they identified 69 drugs (ranging from FDA approved drugs, drugs in clinical trails, and investigational drugs not yet currently in clinical trials) that can target SARS-COV2 PPI's (Please see article for full proposed drug list) - Antiviral tests revealed two broad sets of active drugs and compounds that are proposed to have a high therapeutic benefit: those impairing translation and those modulating Sig - ma1 and Sigma2 receptors. - Approved drugs like Clemastine and Cloperastine, currently used as antihistamines and antitussives, do not have clear roles sustainable for antiviral therapy. Based on their side effect profile, the authors caution against their use in treatment outside of control studies. - Dextromethorphan has been shown to harbor proviral activity and increase viral titers possibly worsening disease course, thus, it's use in treatment should merit caution. Clinical Implications- Dozens of approved drugs are active against Sigma receptors; this has great promise for repurposing and the optimization of these new agents in the fight against COVID-19. - Host-directed intervention as an antiviral strategy overcomes problems associated with drug resistance and also can provide pan-viral therapies as we prepare for the next pandemic. Limitations While the cells used in the study have been proved to be permissive to SARS-CoV2 infections, it does not represent the physiological site of infection - the lung tissue. As a result, there is a risk that some of the findings in the study may not apply as successfully clinically. Additionally, this study is limited simply in this mechanistic based reasoning. All hypotheses require further study to identify the clinical effectiveness of these proposed therapies.TREATMENTReview by Ashley Wehrheim, MS2 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubRenin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors in Patients with Covid-19 Muthiah Vaduganathan et al. The New England Journal of Medicine April 23, 2020 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMsr2005760 Purpose To highlight the current data on the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors in patients with Covid-19 and to discuss the possible harm of with - drawal of these agents during treatment for Covid-19. Study design Special Report Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods This special report reviewed the limited studies available describing the relationship between RAAS via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and severe acute respi - ratory syndrome coronaviruses. It then posits a possible benefit for continued use of RAAS inhibitors in patients with Covid-19, as well as describing the harms of withdraw - al of these agents. Findings The principle cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in lung alveolar epithelial cells is ACE2, an enzyme that counters RAAS activation. Preclinical studies suggest that RAAS inhib - itors increase ACE2 expression, thereby increasing risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is further supported by the high proportion of patients with hypertension admitted with Covid-19 in China. Experimental animal models and small human studies have also suggested a possible benefit in disruption of the RAAS system in patients with Covid-19 by interrupting acute lung damage mediated by the ACE2 receptor and pro - viding cardioprotection with promotion of myocardial recovery after viral infection. Clinical ImplicationsNo guidance currently exists for use of RAAS inhibitors in patients with Covid-19. Due to the possibility of adverse health outcomes, abrupt withdrawal of RAAS inhibitors in patients with high-risk conditions (including those who have heart failure or have had myocardial infarction) is not preferable. This report recommends maintaining stable patients on their previously prescribed RAAS inhibitors while being treated or evaluat - ed for Covid-19 since these medications likely do not alter Covid-19 risk. Limitations Authors note that the data available in humans is too limited to currently support or refute either the use or discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors in patients with Covid-19 to maintain cardiovascular health.TREATMENTReview by Joseph deBettencourt, MS3 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubInterleukin-1 Blockade with High-dose Anakinra in Patients with COVID-19, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, and Hyperinflamma - tion: A Retrospective Cohort Study Giulio Cavalli et al. The Lancet Rheumatology May 7, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2665-9913(20)30127-2 Purpose To determine the efficacy of treatment with Anakinra (recombinant Interluekin-1 receptor antagonist) in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Study design Retrospective cohort study Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods This study was conducted in patients with COVID-19 complicated by moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and hyperinflammation (defined as a serum C-reac - tive protein >100mg/L, >900ng/mL, or both) managed with non-invasive venti - lation outside of the ICU. Patients received 200mg hydroxychloroquine twice a day orally and 400mg lopinavir with 100mg ritonavir twice a day orally (standard treatment group). These patients were compared to a cohort who received additional treatment with anak - inra (either 5mg/kg twice a day IV or 100mg twice a day subcutaneously [low dose]). 29 patients received high dose anakinra with standard treatment, 7 received low dose anakinra with standard treatment, and 16 received stranded treatment alone. The primary endpoint was to compare survival, mechanical ventilation free survival, changes in CRP , respiratory function, and clinical status of each subgroup as assessed at 21 days. Findings At 21 days, 72% of patients receiving high dose anakinra demonstrated a decrease in se - rum C-reactive protein and progressive improvement in respiratory function, survival rate was 90%, and mechanical ventilation-free survival rate was 72%. 50% of patients receiving standard therapy showed respiratory improvement and reduction in serum C-reactive protein at 21 days, with a survival rate of 56% and mechanical ventilation-free survival rate of 50%. Discontinuation of anakinra was not followed by inflammatory relapse. Clinical ImplicationsIn patients with COVID-19 and ARDS managed with non-invasive ventilation outside of the ICU, treatment with high-dose anakinra in addition to standard therapy was safe and associated with superior clinical improvement when compared to standard therapy alone .

Annals of Pharmacotherapy May 12, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/1060028020928052 Purpose To review the theoretical mechanisms and current evidence of the efficacy and safety of select supplements in treatment and prevention of COVID-19 infection. Study design Review article Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods Authors reviewed recent evidence-based literature on supplements and COVID-19 infection. The study focused specifically on vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, elderberry, and silver supple - ments, which were those most frequently mentioned in the news and social media. Studies were not reviewed systematically. Findings Vitamin C (Vit C): Evidence does not support its use for prevention of viral infections and shows only limited benefits of intravenous (IV) administration for acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock. Chinese studies have reported shorter hospital stays for COVID-19 patients treated with high-dose IV Vit C, but these investigations are under powered and use much higher doses than that available over the counter (OTC). Vitamin D (Vit D): COVID-19 patient data has shown a high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D. Studies have demonstrat - ed that oral Vit D3 supplementation can reduce the risk of acute respiratory tract infection, particularly in those with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (<25ng/mL). Patients should follow the recommended daily allowance of Vit D (800-4000IU). Zinc: Studies on supplementation are mixed with only moderate evidence supporting reduction in common cold symptoms. Although reports on zinc consumption for the management of COVID-19 are beginning to emerge, no literature is currently available on its supplementation in the context of COVID-19. Elderberry: Some studies support its use to reduce viral respiratory symptom duration, but they are underpowered and of poor quality. Elderberry may cause several serious adverse effects by interacting with other drugs and its unripe berries are toxic. There is no evidence to support its use in COVID-19. Silver: Colloidal silver has been claimed to be antibacterial and antiviral, however the safety and efficacy are poor. OTC products containing silver are not recognized as safe or effective due to the potential for harmful adverse effects, including neurotoxicity. Clinical ImplicationsPhysicians and pharmacists should be aware that news and social media may influence a patient's supplement use in the context of COVID-19 infection. None of the above-mentioned supplements are currently recommended for COVID-19 prophylaxis or treatment and some may cause serious adverse effects. Healthcare workers should inquire if a patient is using sup - plements to prevent or treat COVID-19 and be prepared to educate about risks.

Gabriela Kuster et al. European Heart Journal March 20, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa235 Purpose To discern whether the administration and/or initiation of renin-angiotensin system (RAAS) inhibiting therapies would be contraindicated in patients diagnosed with or at high risk for contracting SARS-CoV2. Study design Systematic review Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods Review of 23 studies relevant to the interaction between RAAS and SARS-CoV2 was complet - ed, integrating mechanistic data from human and animal studies to reach a recommendation concerning the maintenance and initiation of RAAS-inhibiting therapy in COVID-19 patients. Findings Initial data suggests that patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease (populations treated with RAAS inhibitors) are 3-4x more likely to reach the primary endpoints of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or death secondary to SARS-CoV2 infection, suggest - ing a possible relationship between RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 mortality. Animal studies and human trials suggest ACE2 upregulation following ACE-Inhibitor (ACE-I) or Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) therapy. Though ACE2 has been established as a receptor for viral cell entry, there is not an established causal relationship between ACE2 expression and COVID-19 severity or mortality. Additionally, SARS-CoV2 has been found in cell types not expressing ACE2, suggesting that the presence of ACE2 alone may not be sufficient for infection. Con - versely, a mouse model demonstrated down-regulation of ACE2 with SARS-CoV spike pro - tein exposure; this study also established that ARB administration provided protection from COVID-19 associated lung injury. This gave rise to the theory that RAAS activation may be a greater risk factor for SARS-CoV2 associated mortality than RAAS inhibition. Due to the lack of data and inability to establish a causal relationship between RAAS inhibiting thera - pies and COVID-19 mortality, the risk-benefit ratio would favor maintenance of ACE-I and ARB therapies in patients with cardiovascular disease . It has been well established that discontinuation of RAAS inhibition progresses to deterioration of cardiac function within days-weeks with significant increase in mortality. Clinical ImplicationsDue to the lack of relationship between RAAS inhibitors and COVID-19 mortality, maintenance and/or initiation of ACE-Is, ARBs and MRAs in patients with heart failure, hypertension or myo - cardial infarction is recommended regardless of SARS-CoV2 status. Limitations It is not yet possible to establish a causal relationship between ACE-I or ARB therapies and COVID-19 mortality due to confounding comorbidities. Further research is indicated. Addition - ally, more research is needed to characterize the relationship between SARS-CoV2 viral load, disease severity, ACE2, the RAAS system and therapies that alter the RAAS.BIOLOGYReview by Abigail Bawden, MS1 Table of ContentsCOVID-19Rush Journal ClubEarly Outcomes with Utilization of Tissue Plasminogen Activator in COVID-19 Associated Respiratory Distress: A Series of Five Cases Benjamin Christie III et al Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery May 21, 2020 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1097/ta.0000000000002787 Purpose To assess the efficacy of a thrombolytic agent, Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA), in treat - ing respiratory distress and hypoxemia in patients with COVID-19. Study design Retrospective case series (n=5) Level of evidenceLevel 5 Methods This retrospective case series examines the effects of tPA administration of five patients meeting certain criteria including: positive COVID-19 test, decline in respiratory function, PaO2 < 80 indicating severe hypoxemia despite standard supportive actions, increasing requirements for supplemental oxygen, and a D-dimer result > 1.5ug/mL. An initial 25 mg IV bolus of tPA was administered over two hours with a subsequent 25 mg continuous infusion of tPA over 22 hours, after which a heparin infusion was administered in a weight- based manner. Several outcomes are assessed post-tPA, with an emphasis on PaO2, sup - plemental oxygen requirements, and d-dimer. Findings All patients showed an improvement in their respiratory function following tPA adminis - tration and suffered no deleterious effects secondary to tPA use. Each patient's PaO2 levels showed a higher post-tPA than pre-tPA and increased over time. Supplemental oxygen requirements tended to decrease after treatment and three out of the five patients were able to avoid intubation. Patients' d-dimer levels increased during a 24-hour post-tPA period as expected and returned to normal or near-normal levels after administration of a heparin drip. Clinical ImplicationsThis study suggests that tPA may be a promising treatment option for hypoxemia in COVID-19 patients seeing as administration of tPA was associated with a rise in PaO2 levels and decreasing supplemental oxygen requirements. However, further studies and clinical trials will be necessary to verify these findings. Limitations Limitations noted by the authors include a lack of controls, unknown significance of various non-thrombolytic medications patients received during their hospital stay, and administration of tPA at varying points of disease progression in patients. Additionally, the limited number of participations (n=5) makes it difficult to determine the generalizability of the findings.TREATMENTReview by: Melissa Porterhouse, MS1 of Enzyme Inhibitors and Angio - tensin II Receptor Blockers With Testing Positive for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Neil Mehta et al. JAMA Cardiology May 5, 2020 DOI: 10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1855 Purpose To determine the association of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and an - giotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) use with testing positive for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to study the severity of clinical outcomes of those taking ACEIs/ARBs who tested positive for COVID-19. Study design Retrospective Cohort Study (n=18,472) Level of evidenceLevel 3 Methods A retrospective cohort analysis was performed on all patients tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and April 12, 2020 within the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio and Florida us - ing data from electronic health records (EHRs). Primary analysis examined the association of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity and use of ACEI and/or ARB using overlap propensity score weight - ing. Secondary analysis included clinical outcomes of patients with positive test results. Findings The mean age of the patients was 49 years, 7384 (40%) were male, and 12 725 (69%) were white. Of the patients tested for COVID-19, 2285 (12.4%) were taking ACEIs or ARBs at the time of testing. Among all patients with positive test results (1735, 9.4%), 116 (6.7%) were taking ACEIs, and 98 (5.6%) were taking ARBs. Comparing test positivity rate of those taking ACEIs or ARBs and those who did not, the investigators found that taking either an ACEI or ARB was not associated with an increased likelihood of testing positive for SARS- CoV-2 infection. Additionally, overlap propensity score-weighted analysis showed higher likelihood of hospital admission in those who tested positive and were taking either ACEIs or ARBs, and higher likelihood of ICU admissions for those taking ACEIs. Clinical ImplicationsACEIs and ARBs are important medications in the management of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and may impose serious health risks if withdrawn. This study suggests there is no association between ACEI/ARB use and increased likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19. Therefore, ACEIs and ARBS should continue to be used during the COVID-19 pandemic, as recommended by several professional societies. Limitations This analysis was performed early in the course of the pandemic with a small sample of ACEI and ARB users; therefore, it needs to be repeated with larger data sets and later in the course of the pandemic. Additionally, data did not include information on the duration of ACEI or ARB use, thus the effect of duration could not be considered. Furthermore, medication lists in EHRs are sometimes inaccurate due to patient noncompliance and accidental omittance of medications. Finally, the majority of patients in the study were white, limiting the generaliz - ability of the results.TREATMENTReview by Aliya Rodriguez, MS1 Table of Contents "}
