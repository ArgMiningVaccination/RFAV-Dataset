On the one hand we have enjoyed unprecedented growth in our connections to research around the world--from Australia and New Zealand in the west to Europe and Russia in the east--with new overtures and offers ofresearch; on the other hand, we find ourselves restrained in launching new projects because of a decline in philanthropic funding. The Research Institute has been able to sus- tain its ongoing activities--such as the Online Waldorf Library (OWL) and the publication of thisResearch Bulletin--thanks to the steady backing of the Waldorf Curriculum Fund as well as schoolsthat have remained loyal \"Supporting Members\"of the Institute. At the same time, we will have tolimit our activities in the forthcoming year to com- pleting projects already underway while we seekfunding for new projects. In short, we feel much ofthe uncertainty of the current economic climate.We welcome both advice and support! CCuurrrreenntt PPrroojjeeccttss Our current projects include: Parent Research: We are evaluating and analyz- ing a parent survey by Martin Novom of 318North American Waldorf school parents. Our intention is to publish the results of this survey later in the academic year 2009-2010. Electronic Books Project #2: A collection of out- of-print essays, now available either on disc or as a download from the Online Waldorf Library (OWL), includes the following titles: Reading and Writing by Karl K\u00f6nig Mathematics by Karl K\u00f6nig Embryology and World Evolution by Karl K\u00f6nig Creating Social Sacraments by Dieter Br\u00fcll Sexuality Curriculum for grades 5-12: With the help of a modest grant from the P\u00e4dagogische Forschungsstelle (Educational Research Institute) in Germany, we have begun collecting articles fortranslation, identifying new chapters to be writ- ten, and developing a curriculum for Waldorfschools. We plan to have a book available withinthe next year and a half, provided that the requi-site funds can be secured. Teaching Sensible Science: For the past five years, the Research Institute has offered this course to experienced Waldorf school class teach- ers who were ready to deepen their understandingand practice of a phenomenological approach toteaching science in grades 6-8. In response to requests from participants, plans are underway to offer a further program for veterans of the coursewho wish to broaden this approach to otheraspects of the curriculum. Meanwhile, the most recent cycle of this program--which typicallymeets for three separate weeks during the schoolyear and vacation times--had to be postponedbecause financial constraints prevented Waldorf schools from sending teachers they had pledged to sponsor. We are grateful to the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA) and the Waldorf Educational Foundation for their con- tinued support of this important project. International Collaboration with Researchers: One of the guiding missions of the Research Institute is to build bridges with scientists and researchers working outside Waldorf education on topics of mutual interest. In this context, DouglasGerwin was invited to take part during a weekaround Easter 2009 in two conferences of medical and pedagogical researchers\u2014one in San Diego,CA, connected with the annual gathering of the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the other at the Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland, where the leadership of the Anthroposophical Society hosted a conference for physicians, therapists, and educators. Despite theevident cultural differences--to say nothing of the nine time zones\u2014that separated these two gath- erings, some remarkably similar themes were sounded in both events. A separate article on these shared themes appears in this issue of the Research Bulletin. Report from the Co-Directors David Mitchell and Douglas GerwinT on the Tenth Grade Curriculum in Kassel, Germany: This spring, Michael Holdrege, a Waldorf high school biology teacher at the Chicago Waldorf School, represented the Research Institute at the International Refresher Course in Kassel, Germany, focusing on tenth grade curriculum. The conference, held in bothEnglish and German, attracted a worldwide partici-pation. In Holdrege's seminar alone the thirty-four participants represented sixteen nationalities. In his keynote address on \"Challenges and Opportunities of Waldorf Education in North America,\" Holdrege spoke about the issue of high tuition and the result-ant high expectations of parents. He also spoke about religious diversity and the SAT and high-stakes testing. He questioned whether the U.S. gov- ernment had abandoned its role as social arbiter by deregulating economic commerce and over- regulating school life. Schools, he noted, are des- perately seeking rigid organizational models and failsafe forms of assessment, and yet, like any liv-ing social organism, they actually require flexible and malleable forms capable of responding differ- ently in each situation. He lamented the energy used in this Sisyphean pursuit. He also spoke about the emergence of a subculture of some sixty million people called the \"Cultural Creatives,\" a number ofwhom are drawn to Waldorf education. Connections with Russia: David Mitchell was invited to Moscow to speak about high-stakestesting and the Bulletinarticle on this subject that was reprinted last June in the academic journalPedagogical Journal of Bashkortostan University, Ufa, Russia(seeResearch Bulletin, Vol. XIII, no. 2, pp. 21-30). A separate article on the experiences gathered on this journey appears in this issue of the Research Bulletin. Research in Norway: David Mitchell was also invited to Norway where he met with researchers on childhood and Waldorf education to establish future collaboration and share papers. The Anthropos Verlag and Bookhandlung in Oslo now carry most titles from AWSNA Publications, aswell as several issues of the Research Bulletin. These publications were featured at a Scandinavian Waldorf school teachers conference in August. \"Assessment without High-Stakes Testing: Protecting Children and the Purpose of School\": This article (see Research Bulletin, Volume XIII, #2), writ- ten by five Waldorf educators under the aegis of4 \u00b7 Report from the Co-Directors Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2the Research Institute, has been growing steadily in popularity and attracting interest around the world.

During her undergraduateyears at Harvard she learned about the work of Rudolf Steiner and Waldorf education. After grad-uation she traveled first to England to complete foundation studies at Emerson College, then to the Waldorf Pedagogical Seminar in Stuttgart,Germany, for a two-year teacher training. On herreturn to New York City she became the first grade teacher at the Rudolf Steiner School. Her husband, a descendent of Presidents John and John Quincy Adams, was employed inthe U.S. Foreign Service, so the family movedabroad to live in Thailand, Romania, andAzerbaijan. After the family returned to Washington, DC, Natalie became a tutor and part-time teacher in the high school math and science programs at the Washington Waldorf School. Eventually she picked up a class in the sixth grade and, after fin-ishing the eighth grade, agreed to serve as Faculty Chair, the position she currently holds.Bulletin 4eflection will show that consciousness is not a thing, not a configuration of neurons or elec- trochemical activity\u2014although it may require these for its manifestation in us. Consciousnesscan most clearly be conceived, I believe, according to the polarities favored by the Greeks, and, more recently, by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Rudolf Steiner, and Owen Barfield, among many others. The Greek view of courage provides a good example. For the Greeks, courage wasn't a thing, wasn't a hormone level, for example. It was thatwhich mediated the polarity of fear and foolhardi-ness. A coward, through fear, will not act when hemight. A fool, through foolhardiness, will act rash-ly when reflection might save his life. A coura- geous person balances the tug of fear and theforce of foolhardiness to find a middle way. Of what is consciousness the mediator? Well, it is clear that we may perceive the world and that we may think about the world. (Even those whodeny the existence of consciousness do not denythe thinking that goes into their books and theperceptions of those who read them.) Perception and conception form the polarity that conscious-ness mediates. This is clear enough as a thought, and it was Owen Barfield, I believe, who first putit this way. For Rudolf Steiner, we may call con-sciousness the spirit. From at least one point ofview, consciousness and spirit are one and thesame. Consciousness, after all this, is one thread common to almost every article in this issue, con- sciousness and the call to responsibility that con-sciousness entails. These are shown here withregard to school administration and governance and our work together in them, particularly incontemplative inquiry and professional develop-ment; in recognizing the social, political, and cul-tural contexts in which we form our schools, hereand abroad; in the way we regard our own devel- opment as teachers and the development of ourstudents; in taking responsibility for social-emotional education and health of our students; intaking responsibility for the conduct of our Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2research; and in thinking about the very way we live on our planet. Without planning a theme, we nonetheless received several articles all at once that examine ideas around school governance, administration, and the function of faculty meetings and the so- called college of teachers. Christopher Schaeferdiscusses seven dimensions or aspects of social work in the conscious creation of a Waldorfschool community. Grounded in Steiner's work and representing years of thinking and working with these ideas, Schaefer's thought-provokingarticle nudges us in the direction of accepting ourresponsibilities as members of Waldorf school communities not to shirk the hard work of fulfill- ing Steiner's vision. Tackling a similar theme, Jon McAlice discuss- es the organizational structure, governance, and unifying forces of Waldorf school leadership. He finds these in three principles--creativity, sustain- ability, and accountability. Like Schaefer, he calls us to take up consciously the challenges of schoolgovernance and administration. Continuing this theme, but from the point of view specifically of the work of teachers collec- tively, Kevin Avison uses the model of organic coherence to discuss the meditative life of teach-ers in a Waldorf school and how this provides the center from which healthful education grows. Heprovides a brief and mundane but illustrative case study of a college of teachers at work, and ends by elucidating a \"flow chart\" to demonstrate therecursive process by which meditative work may occur in a healthy school. Similarly, Laura Birdsall and Thomas Patteson report on a professional development model, based on clear protocols, that serves to reinforce both the social mission described in Schaefer's and McAlice's articles and the meditative work described in Avison's. A similarity among all these pieces is recognition of the necessity for ongoingevaluation and assessment of all aspects of workin a school. Meditation\u2014contemplative inquiry,we might say\u2014is a necessary component of suchRFrom PM Page 56 \u00b7 From the Editor Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2work (more on that from Martyn Rawson in the next issue of the Bulletin), but, without discourse among colleagues and without assessment of its effectiveness, it may serve to further isolate one teacher from another, to reinforce convention,rather than open new avenues for teaching andlearning. This issue also contains Part II of Renate Long-Breipohl's article on the simultaneous devel-opment of teachers and young children. Taking the zodiac as her guide, she examines profound symbols and metaphors for self-development andwork in the classroom. Speaking personally, assomeone somewhat baffled by\u2014and not all that interested in\u2014the zodiac, I find her elucidation of these symbols heartwarming, clear, and true. This issue also brings two articles from Russia. The first is David Mitchell's report on hisvisit to Russia following reprinting of the Research Bulletin's\"High Stakes Testing\" in a Russian educa- tional journal. Mitchell shows, against the back-drop of Russian history and culture, how stan-dardized testing poses a unique challenge to stu-dents and, especially, to Waldorf schools. The second is Cassandra Hartblay's report on a women's collective in Siberia that, usingWaldorf education methods, has started a smallschool for disabled children. Despite poverty, bureaucracy, and Russian attitudes toward the disabled that, by Western standards, are far from enlightened, these women are growing their smallschool. A brief talk by Peter Guttenh\u00f6fer at aSouth African Waldorf education conference rein- forces the idea that small schools can succeed\u2014 he proposes the conscious creation of smallschools for young children based on Waldorf edu-cation methods to serve communities that cannotsupport a large Waldorf school. His idea also incorporates the informality and flexibility that characterize what we have come to call home- schooling. For high school and upper grade school teach- ers, this issue includes David Mitchell's article on asocial-emotional curriculum for adolescents.Social-emotional education has been a hot topicfor several years, and it's not a topic Waldorfschools can ignore. Mitchell's argument\u2014thatemotions can be educated, and that theyshouldn't be educated \"by the way,\" but deliber-ately\u2014is clear and succinct. The article ends witha table demonstrating a sample social-emotional education curriculum for high schools. Rounding out the issue are Douglas Gerwin's report on two conferences he attended this spring, Michael D'Aleo's description of insights gained while teaching a youth group in Sweden, and Richard House's article on television and children. Gerwin describes the all-too-common way in which even like-minded, thoughtful, and well- meaning persons talk past each other at confer-ences, and draws the conclusion that we cannot simply rely on statistics and presentations in our research; we must deliberately take into accountboth the evidence and the logic we use in reaching our conclusions. D'Aleo, based on a simple calcu-lation, unfolds the ramifications we may recognizein the face of growing population and a finite globe with which to sustain it. He concludes withlessons we may draw from tribal peoples who live simple, meaningful, beautiful, and sustainablelives. We come across many articles addressing the dangers of television for children but we don'tfind many that add much to what we already know. We believe Richard House's article, a sum-mary of findings on \"technological toxicity\" and children, is noteworthy for its scope and brevity. After a truly rainy beginning to the summer, the past days have been blistering and humid. Consciousness tends to want no more than aporch swing, some light reading, and a glass of lemonade; both thinking and perceiving dim, on hiatus. Instead, our new publication schedule callsfor reading and editing the contents you nowhold. CCoorrrreeccttiioonnss In our last issue, the correct title of the article entitled \"Crises in the Kindergarten\" should have been \"Crisis in the Kindergarten: Why Children Need to Play in School.\" We also neglected to include Ed Miller's name as co-author, with Joan Almon, of this article. We regret these errors and are pleased to correct them here.Bulletin 6n many years of working with Waldorf schools, I am often asked why it is so difficult, why so many meetings, why work with consensus or, more pointedly, why doesn't the Board just appoint a principal or director and have this person run the school efficiently, without all this participation and complexity. Somewhat tongue in cheek, I say, perhaps it isn't a question of efficiency, but of live- liness, of engagement, of juiciness. Yet the ques- tions are valid. Why is it that we struggle with new social and community forms in developingWaldorf schools in North America and around the world? After thinking about and researching this question, I have come to believe that there are atleast seven aspects of or dimensions to the socialmission of Waldorf education. The first and mostobvious answer is that the first Waldorf School inStuttgart, Germany, was founded as an independ- ent school, in large part as an answer to the con- ditions of social, economic, and political chaosresulting from World War I. The school, inaugu-rated in 1919, grew out of Rudolf Steiner's efforts to provide Central Europe with a new approach to thinking about and ordering society, referred to as the Movement for Threefolding Society. 1In the midst of Steiner's political and social activity, EmilMolt, the director of the Waldorf Astoria CigaretteFactory, asked him whether he could help in the founding of an independent school for the work- ers' children and others interested in a new form of education. Steiner responded with warmth and eagerness, for, as he said, \"the great problem ofthe future will be that of education. How will weeducate children so that they, as adults, can growinto the social, democratic, and spiritually freeareas of life in the best way possible?\" 2 Steiner's response contained two essential perspectives. The first was that the school mustbe legally and financially independent of local andstate government because the state can never fos- ter an education for freedom; it needs to satisfy a myriad of bureaucratic, political, and economicdemands. Indeed, according to Steiner, not only the Waldorf school, but all cultural institutions\u2014 such as research institutes, school, colleges, uni- versities, dance troupes, and theaters\u2014need to befree of state control and to be permeated by the principle of freedom if society is to develop in a healthy manner. The state\u2014the administration oflaws and legislation for the common good\u2014must be limited in scope and based on the principle of equality, of democratic participation, while eco- nomic life needs to move toward associations,embodying principles of brotherhood and sister- hood between producers, consumers, and traders. 3Although it is not my purpose to describe the details of the threefold social organ- ism in this introduction, it is important to note that Steiner's social and political ideas embodiedthe principles of the French Revolution in a newway: liberty for cultural life, equality for demo-cratic life, and fraternity for economic life. Hisideas were far from utopian in the context of aCentral Europe destroyed by war and torn among the competing ideologies of capitalism, socialism,and communism. A second point, connected to the first, is that the form and curriculum of Waldorf educationshould lead to the proper education of children sothat they can become conscious and creativeadults, capable of developing a healthy society.Certainly, when we meet Waldorf school gradu- ates, we may sense their optimism, creativity, and engagement with life. But the connection betweenWaldorf education and social reform is deeper and more specific. In the lectures cited previously, published as Education as a Social Problem, Steiner suggested that: 1. Providing a worthy environment and edu- cation through proper imitation in earlychildhood develops a sense for freedom in later life; 2. Developing a proper sense for natural authority in the lower school provides theI Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2The Social Mission of Waldorf School Communities Christopher PM Page 78 \u00b7 The Social Mission of Waldorf School Communities basis for a healthy rights life in relationships and society; and 3. Developing a sense for human love, for the beauty and grandeur ofnature, and for the mag-nitude and diversity ofthe human enterpriseoffers a basis for ahealthy economic life or,as Steiner stated, \"broth- erliness, fraternity, in economic life 4as it has to be striven for in thefuture, can only arise in human souls if edu-cation after the fifteenth year works con- sciously toward universal human love.\" 5 These are far-reaching statements. The con- nections they imply are not always obvious. Howcan imitation be the basis of freedom or respect for authority the foundation for a sense for equal-ity? A starting point can be the recognition that inearly childhood the forces of the will are first developed and in the time between ages 7 and 14the basis for a healthy feeling life established. Imitation of a healthy and loving social and physi-cal environment builds confidence and security inlater life while nurturing the substance of individ-ual will, the basis for self awareness and the needfor freedom. Respect for the authority of a caring teacher or a loving parent establishes boundaries,provides structure for the emerging feeling life, and encourages awareness of rights and responsi-bilities in the class and in the broader human com- munity. In describing further aspects of the social mis- sion of Waldorf education, it is essential to gain insight into the nature of modern Western con-sciousness. The growth of individual conscious- ness, of self awareness, from the 18th century tothe present, encouraged by the industrial and post-industrial ages, has led to an increasedawareness of human rights, including such mile-stones as the abolition of slavery, the growth of women's rights, and the U.N. Charter of Universal Human Rights. It has also led to a new psycholog-ical understanding of the human being in themany schools of modern psychology. Yet, forSteiner, this growth of individual self awareness Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2has come at a price, and this price includes the loss of socialinstincts embedded in tradition and extended family structures and the growth of egotism, ofanti-social attitudes and behav-ior. The struggle for mutualunderstanding, the breakdownof family relationships, and thegrowth of interpersonal violenceare all symptoms of this anti- social terror of the age. Steiner saw this develop- ment of consciousness as justi-fied, indeed inevitable, but felt that new social forms, new communities, were needed to balance the anti-social tendencies of modern humanity: Anti-social impulses must arise inward- ly so that human beings may reach the height of their development; outwardly, in social life, social structures must work insuch a way that people do not completely drift apart in life. Hence the social demands of the present; they can in a certain sense be seen as the justified demand for an outer balance to the inner, essentially anti- social evolutionary tendency of humanity. 6 For Steiner, both the principles of the threefold social organism and the new self-administered community forms of the Waldorf school were waysof balancing the one-sided, more egotistical nature of modern consciousness; they were ways of help- ing people meet each other at deeper levels, there-by fostering a process of mutual development. The self-administered partnership forms of the more than one thousand Waldorf schools and ini- tiatives around the globe find their source in these insights into the nature of modern consciousness. To develop the appropriate forms of governance among teachers, parents, and staff, among ateachers' college, a board of trustees, an adminis- tration, and a parent association is an ongoing task for each Waldorf school and is part of thesocial mission of Waldorf education. Since 1919, for ninety years, independent Waldorf schools have attempted to evolve community forms in which the interests of teachers, parents, staff, andfriends can find true expression. In Waldorf schools, the absence of formalhierarchy, the groupdecision-makingprocesses, the need toget to know eachother as teachers, par-ents, and staff Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2Christopher Schaefer \u00b7 9 In most Waldorf schools in the United States and Canada this has meant a teachers' circle, or faculty council, having primary responsibility for all pedagogical life\u2014determining the curriculumand hiring, mentoring, evaluating, and, if need be,dismissing teachers. The other main decision- making group is a board of trustees consisting ofteachers, parents, and friends who carry legal andfinancial responsibility for the school, who sup-port the education by making sure that there are adequate financial resources and a suitable physi- cal space for supporting the education. An admin-istration, grounded in an understanding of thecurriculum, provides the support and the exper- tise needed to help increasingly mature and com- plex schools function well. The parent association may foster community dialogues, sponsor adulteducation, support festivals, and serve the causeof responsible communication between teachers and parents. In Waldorf schools, the absence of formal hierarchy, the group decision-making processes, the need to get to know each other asteachers, parents, and staff pull us out of our isolation. The form andnature of self-administration in our schools mean we need to learn toappreciate the differences between people while at the same time accepting that we are brothers and sisters on the road of mutual development. While it is an exaggeration, I sometimes sug- gest that Waldorf schools are designed toenhance conflict. Certainly they are formed tohelp us meet at deeper levels and to help us \"rubeach other into shape.\" This means that all adults in Waldorf schools need to be on a path of reflec- tive self-development, to be willing to work their issues, for, without this foundation, interpersonal conflicts can undermine the proper functioning ofthe school. Even in the first Waldorf school, with Steiner present as founder and director, questions of trust, leadership, interpersonal conflict, and theproper delegation of authority were significantissues, as the essay by Francis Gladstone,Republican Academies, makes vividly clear. 7 Steiner described the reality of karma, of mutual destiny, as coming to expression in thesocial world, in the sphere of human relationships. For him, the fundamental reason for new socialand community forms was to give people an opportunity to awaken to the nature of their mutual destiny, to the reality of karma. The spe-cialization of work and the large, complex, bureaucratic nature of modern institutional life, coupled with the anti-social nature of our present consciousness, create the danger that individuals will not meet at a deep enough level to awaken totheir common destiny, depriving each of them of the opportunity of becoming who they are meantto be. If we reflect on our own life accurately, we will see the important role that a teacher, a grand-parent, a chance conversation with a visiting friend, or a difficult experience with a colleague has played in helping us to become the person we are today. The self-administered community forms of Waldorf schools exist to help us bring the mutuali- ty of karma to consciousness. This mutuality is wonderfully expressed by a sayingof Martin Luther King, Jr.: All men are caught in an inescapable network of mutuali-ty, tied in a single garment ofdestiny. Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be. And you can never be what youought to be until I am what I ought to be. 8 The sixth dimension of the social mission of Waldorf education, that of supporting a new fam- ily culture, is apparent to most people involved in Waldorf education. The rich image of child devel- opment, the celebration of festivals, the impor-tance of prayer and of rhythm in the life of a child, and the understanding that parents are trustees of the child with the task of helping eachchild discover who he or she is meant to become are just a few of the ways in which Waldorf schools help to develop a new family culture. A strong parent association can make this a central part of its work, hosting educational events and supporting parents in the often bewildering task of establishing a family. The last of the seven aspects or dimensions of the social mission of Waldorf education is that ofco-creating with the spirit. While not frequently[I]n exercising the social man-date of Waldorfeducation 910 \u00b7 The Social Mission of Waldorf School Communities and Avoids Clouding the discussed, Waldorf education is permeated with the notion that we are co-creating with spiritual beings. Indeed, for Steiner, the \"task of education, understood in a spiritual sense, is to bring thesoul-spirit into harmony with the temporal body.\" 9The challenge to the teacher is to carry on the work of the angels; to harmonize the spirit ofthe incarnating child with an inherited physicalbody. Through meditating on an individual child,through working with verses and prayers, throughcelebrating festivals, and through practicing work- ing with the good being of the school in sacra-mental conversation, Waldorf school communities are encouraged to practice a dialogue with the spirit. This practice is significant, for I have theexperience that spiritual beings are anxiously waiting for the opportunity to enter into conver-sation with us. Vaclav Havel points to the realityof this co-creating process by calling for an aware- ness of the \"secret order of the cosmos\" and the importance of recognizing that we are \"beheld from above.\" 10 Waldorf schools, in addition to their pedagogical mission of providing a holistic, age- appropriate education, have the social mission ofdeveloping new community forms for the future. This mission or task has at least the seven aspects described: 1. Education free of state control; this pro- motes a free cultural life. 2. Educating children to become healthy, cre- ative adults who are capable of doing thegood, of fostering a healthy society. 3. Partnership community forms in which the true interests of teachers, parents, children,and administrative staff are recognized. 4. Communities of mutual interest in which we are invited to become brothers and sis- ters on the road of mutual development, togrow by working on our issues together. 5. Destiny communities in which we are encouraged to become aware of our mutualkarma. 6. Communities supporting the development of a new family culture. 7. Communities in which we are practicing co- creating with the spirit. These aspects or dimensions of the social mis- sion of Waldorf education describe a far-reachingand complex task, for in exercising the social man- date of Waldorf education we are sowing the seeds for a new society.

To some extent these struggles revolve around questions of authority,questions that at their worst spiral downward into struggles for power, or they reflect a loyaltyto forms that have been handed down as appro- priate for Waldorf schools. In some cases we rec-ognize in these forms the inability to create and sustain viable structures out of a sense for thewhole. At the center of all of them lies the ques- tion of the identity of Waldorf education. This question of identity has grown more pressing over the course of the last fifteen years as the number of Waldorf schools has grown andas a new generation of teachers has moved intopositions of responsibility within the schools. Ithas been accompanied by a concerted efforttoward institutional stability and assimilation intothe greater educational landscape. This push hasembraced forms of school development and quali-ty assurance that are ubiquitous in the main-stream, while making efforts to adapt them to thespecial situation of Waldorf education with itsfocus on individual learning.Although it has resulted in stronger institutional formsand a somewhat more profes- sional face for Waldorf educa- tion, it has also exacerbated the increasingly existential question: What makes aWaldorf school Waldorf? The questions of school identity and of school gover-nance are inextricably connected. This is whatRudolf Steiner indicated to the teachers of the first Waldorf school when they gathered inStuttgart for the brief, intense training in which Waldorf education was first articulated. The pas- sage in which he speaks about the way the school is to be governed is brief and cryptic: Therefore we will structure the school not governmentally, but administratively, and manage it in a republican manner. In a true teachers' republic, we will not be able to lean back and rest on the directivesof a headmaster; we will have to bring tobear what gives each of us the possibilityto take full responsibility for what we have to do. Each must be fully responsible. The role of the headmaster will be replaced bythis preparatory seminar in which we will work to acquire the spirit that will unite the school. If we work hard, this seminar will engender in us our spirit of unity. 1 A careful reading shows that Steiner speaks here about three aspects that are necessary to the school's success. First he speaks about the organi- zational structure: it is to be administrative, notgovernmental. Second, he points out that the gov- ernance model should be republican, not dictatori- al. Then he speaks about what it will take toreplace the unifying force of the headmaster or principal. Translated into contemporary language, Steiner is speaking about the three basic functions in an organization: leadership (the unifying force), manage- ment (governance model), and administration (the way anorganization is structured inorder to get things done). The latter should not be confused with the various administrativefunctions in schools. These are present in all three areas. In his book The Seven Habits of Highly Successful People Steven Covey explores these three functions and their interdependencies. He points out that all three are necessary and proper but need to knowtheir own strengths and weaknesses. This also applies to what Steiner sketched out that eveningin Stuttgart. I The art of pedagogical study is as importantto the health of aWaldorf school as isthe art of teaching. Identity and 1112 \u00b7 Identity and Governance Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2The most fragile and exciting part of this sketch is contained in what Steiner says about the collaborative path to finding a unified center. The shared experience of the \"preparatory seminar,\" if everyone works hard, will serve to \"engender in us our spirit of unity.\" If we stop to consider that neither management nor administration can func-tion without leadership, Steiner's vision ofteacher-guided education stands or falls on thequestion of this collaborative learning experience.Without it, the school lacks a common center, anddecision-making becomes a matter either of per- sonal interest, with the accompanying tendencytoward power struggles, or of institutional expedi-ency based on compromise. The form of self-governance that we are chal- lenged to develop and sustain hinges on thisactivity. It manifests itself in pedagogical study, the sharingof teaching questions andinsights, and, most especially, in ongoing striving to deepen ourability to recognize the spiritual gifts and questions that weencounter in children. It is a dia- logical undertaking, a space inwhich the teachers enter into a quality of listening and learningwith one another similar to that which they hope to achieve in the classroom with the children. It is a space of highly focused activity, of a question- ing learning, the space in which Waldorf educa-tion is developed out of the encounter with the spiritual reality of specific children, where Waldorf education comes alive and meets theintuitive forces of the future. It is the only space inwhich the future of education can be conceived. The art of pedagogical study is as important to the health of a Waldorf school as is the art of teaching. This applies not only to what is often narrowly termed \"the pedagogical realm.\" The financial health of our schools is wedded directlyto the quality of learning that takes place in class-rooms, encounters that are enhanced andenlivened through this activity of pedagogical dia-logue. The classroom is at once a concert hall and a laboratory, the teacher a participant-observer.Each day, each year should bring insights that allow us to better meet the developmental needs of the children who find their way to us, not mere-ly cater to the supposed wishes of the parents or position ourselves more successfully in the greater educational landscape. Financial health is linked to the evolving vitality of the educational encounter, the verve of learning. This vitality, thisverve is the spiritual expression of pedagogical collaboration. When we consider the struggles many schools have today with questions of governance, it seems to make sense not to try to find ways to fix the problem\u2014for instance, by importing success- ful programs or training methods, or hiring con- sultants to present solutions\u2014but to step backand ask ourselves: Are there time and space in the school's rhythm that allow this quality of dia-logue to unfold? Do we give it the space itdeserves? Are the skills necessary for a productive dialogue practiced and cultivated? No self- governance structure can suc- ceed in a school in which thisdialogue is lacking. Conversely, where it lives, governance takeson a fully new quality. It becomes a question of findingforms that allow us to realize the educational impulses that ariseout of this intentional, reflected commitment to our children. BBaallaannccee aanndd IInntteerrddeeppeennddeennccee Finding structures that work for any given school is no easy matter. There are no general solutions. Each school presents a unique opportu- nity to develop self-governing structures that serve pedagogical creativity. Yet, although thereare no general solutions, there are basic principlesat work in every social organism. An understand-ing of these is helpful. Due to the nature of their work, schools are social institutions that work explicitly with thefuture. Although it is clear that as a teacher we often have to deal with the past, learning takesplace when a bit of the future lights up in the present. Unlike factories or stores which deal with the refinement and distribution of materials formed in the past, a school is constantly working with what is in the process of becoming, the manifestation of the evolving individual. It is help- ful to keep this in mind: A school is a workingcommunity dedicated to the act of becoming.The questions of school identity andof McAlice \u00b7 13 Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2When one reads the brochures and websites of many Waldorf schools, one finds language that speaks of education as though it were a product, something that one can deliver, with \"Waldorf\" being one specific form of educational product.Education, especially Waldorf education, is by itsnature not a product; it is a hope, a possibility. It is due to this that we can speak of schools in terms of Steiner's thoughts on the threefold nature of the body social as belonging to thespiritual-cultural sphere. If schools were marketing aneducational product theywould have to function within the service sector, which is aform of what Steiner speaks ofas the economic sphere. A number of educators have rec-ognized this in recent yearsand have formed for-profit educational services with anexplicitly outcome-basedapproach and clear learningobjectives. These services arerun as businesses and, in somecases, have been quite successful. This is clearly not our focus as Waldorf educators. Yet in everyschool we can find a tension between thoseaspects of the school's life that are intertwinedwith the realities of the economic sphere and those that are most closely engaged in the chal- lenge of finding pedagogical insight. This should be no surprise. Economic thinking, as it has developed in our time, requires outcome- based approaches in order to assess effectiveness. Such approaches must be replicable. When this form of thinking dominates in a school, we findthe tendency toward standardization of both the learning goals and the teaching methods. There is a tendency toward strict forms, repeatableachievements. The outer image presented by the school takes up ever more time and energy.Emphasis is placed on institutional stability, mak-ing sure that the school has everything that aschool should have; programs mushroom, and theparts start to become more important than the whole. The tension between institutional stability and pedagogical creativity is an intrinsic reality ofevery Waldorf school. The challenge of findingappropriate forms of governance can be met only if we recognize that both are essential to the long- term existence of a school and if we understand the nature of their relationship in light of the raison d' \u00eatre , the essential goal of the school as an institution. The striving for institutional stabili- ty must serve the cultural-spiritual impulse; the latter cannot be channeled into forms that seemto serve the former. This is what lies behind Steiner's injunction that the vision guiding the development of a school must arise out of the collaborative dialogue of those most inti-mately connected to the chil-dren themselves, the teachers.Insight into what is needed in education can come onlythrough reflected encounterwith learning children. If these two necessary fields of activity in a school are notbalanced by a third, we can readily picture the recurringclashes and compromises that must occur in the life of a school. Conflict is inevitable, especially as those who take responsibility for various aspects of a school's life do so with great energy and dedica-tion. The third field of activity is one in whichthese two polarities find a dynamic balance.Those who are familiar with Steiner's work onquestions of social development will recognize that this balancing activity lies between the realms of necessity (economics) and creativity(individual development) and rests on the agree- ments, on the articulated rights and responsibili- ties, and on the clearly delineated processes that guide interactions within the community. It is themiddle sphere, the \"rights\" sphere, the sphere in which governance, in its narrow sense, comes to institutional expression. Over the course of the last few years, I have come to call these three realms of activity sustain- ability, accountability, and creativity. Any gover- nance structure adopted by a school must devote time, space, and resources to the practice of all three activities and articulate clearly the nature ofthe relationships among them. Although a number of schools have worked intensely on developing organizational structuresConflict is inevitable, especially as thosewho take responsibilityfor various aspects ofa school's life \u00b7 Identity and Governance that reflect Steiner's work on the threefold nature of social interaction, there is little or no recogni- tion of the fact that each of these three realms of activity needs a different structure in order to be effective. The archetypal form of a productive pedagog- ical dialogue is given in what is often termed the teachers' meditation, the words Rudolf Steiner spoke to the teachers of the first Waldorf school at the beginning of their training seminar. In this imaginative picture, he speaks of the relationshipbetween the task of teaching at this point in theevolution of humanity and the work of the spiritu- al beings that form the third hierarchy: angels,archangels, and archai. In rela- tion to the concepts ofstrength, courage, and light, he shows how these beings informour work with the qualities ofimagination, inspiration, andintuition. As we work throughthe images we discover thatwhat is described is a pathfrom the inner soul work of theindividual to the illumination ofa community of teachers. Each brings his or herexperiences into the circle of teachers. Through aconsciously cultivated connection with an angel,these experiences are raised out of the realm of the personal into a realm in which the imaginative reality of what lies behind them can begin to speak. In a circle of colleagues, these experiences flow together with what each brings from his orher encounters with children. The archangels bearfrom one to the other what each has to give,what each has to receive. In this flow of intention- al dialogue, the archai bring the light of intuitive understanding. Whoever has experienced this striving toward insight through dialogue knows that its outcomes cannot be programmed. Insight can speak through the words of each and every member ofthe circle. When true insight speaks, throughwhoever is then able to voice it, it unites the cir-cle, and we leave such a meeting feeling enlivened and strengthened for the work ahead. The structure of creativity is an open one, with space for a variety of exchanges, questions,explorations, and challenges. Intent is focusedthrough specific questions, such as those regard-ing physiological development in 7th graders, learning to read, or movement and learning. Perhaps the group studies together. How does Steiner approach the question? What are ourobservations? Then, step by step, always focused on the goal: to better understand the question inorder to let this understanding flow into teaching. This is a quality of work that has nothing directly to do with decision-making processes, yet plays a decisive role in the development of the school. When done effectively, it creates the spiri- tual and pedagogical background against whichdecisions can become apparent. Whereas collaborative creativity requires such an open, dynamic structure, the activities of sustainabilityand accountability requiremore closed, regimented struc-tures. Even these differ, how- ever, from each other. An institution becomes sus- tainable when all the availableresources are stewarded in anongoing, renewable manner.Over the course of the last sev- eral years, there has been a growing awareness that the long-term institutional health of a school rests on a delicate web of relationships. Some of these exist within the institution (personnel ques- tions and human resources in the corporate sense, for example), others in the encounter with the sur-rounding community (parent relationships and community visibility, for example), and yet others with the society at large (other Waldorf schools, accrediting bodies, and the economy, for exam-ple). Taken together these represent the ecologicalreality of the school as an evolving social organ-ism. Sustainable resource management or stew- ardship is only possible out of an understandingof the complexities of these relationships. It takes expertise in a number of different fields, such as finance, law, communication, planning, design,and marketing. Any given question must be exam-ined or explored from each point of view. Insteadof an open, dynamic dialogue in which spiritual or pedagogical insight can arise, we need here a structure that ensures that the various aspects ofany planned initiative can be examined throughthe eyes of various areas of expertise. Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2Education, especially Waldorf education, isby its nature not aproduct; it third structural gesture is that of account- ability. Questions of accountability appear to take up the most time in faculty meetings and decision- making processes. A lack of clear processes and transparent responsibilities in this realm serves to drain a school of its vitality. Immeasurable amounts of time and effort go into finding solu- tions for problems that arise in this realm. In the process, many of the most sacred aspects of col- laborative work are sacrificed\u2014honesty, frank- ness, consequence, and clarity. What actually is accountability? In the best of worlds, it is whateach individual strives for in his or her work. Doing what we say we will do, fulfilling theresponsibilities that are attached to our position, acting in a manner that reflects the stated goalsof the community, the active striving to rightwhatever wrongs may have occurred in the course of our work\u2014all are facets of this striving.In creating an accountability structure within a school, we acknowledge consciously the need tohelp one another live up to these strivings. Anaccountability structure also ensures that what we have decided to do as a community gets done, that there is the needed follow-through on proj-ects, that planning takes place, and that emer-gent questions are addressed in the proper man- ner. This is functionally the most selfless of the three realms of activity, yet, at the same time, it is the most demanding. The accountability structure stands and medi- ates between the two poles of sustainability andcreativity. It has a balancing function, bringing the activity of each of these realms into a produc- tive relationship with that of the other. Because of this mediating charge, it is a structure that must be mandated from both sides, from those respon- sible for the long-term institutional existence of the school and from those who are involved in daily encounters with children or young people. (I have been asked a number of times if these two bodies are the Board and the College. Yes, and no. In the organizational structure most common in American Waldorf schools, the Board is legallyresponsible for the existence of the school as acorporate body. The idea of the College suffersfrom a lack of clarity about its role, its function, and its spiritual basis. In an ideal situation, onecould imagine Board and College taking on thesetwo polar functions. In contemporary practice, Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2there is much confusion concerning which body is responsible for what. In the confusion, Colleges at times function as spiritually correct over-Boards, and Boards find themselves stepping in to ensure the continuance of Waldorf education.) TThhee AAddmmiinniissttrraattiivvee FFaallllaaccyy The last 15 years have seen a mushrooming of administrative positions in schools. Although this is to be expected as institutions pass through their pioneering years and reach a certain level ofmaturity, it poses a problem. Administration, if not carefully managed, tends either to become bureaucratic or to develop an undue sense of itsown importance. Administrative functions are service functions. Good administrative co-workers do not want to be anything else but of service. They are professional service personnel. They jus- tifiably expect guidance, clear work expectations,and oversight, and they take pride in doing theirwork well. Anyone in an administrative position who does not find fulfillment within these bound- aries is in the wrong position. Any school that hires administrative personnel without givingthem proper guidance does a grave injustice notonly to these persons but to the viability of theschool. The lack of management in the administrative realm is the result of an unfortunate approach to\"threefolding\" that has been propagated through- out the school movement. Placing administrativeresponsibility for a school in the hands of admin-istrators is somewhat similar to placing financial responsibility for a banking institution in thehands of its bookkeepers. Administration in a Waldorf school serves the realization of pedagogi-cal vision in a sustainable manner. It can be effec- tive in the fulfillment of this task only if it is man- aged within the framework of the accountabilitystructure that a school adopts. The approach to administrative structures most prevalent in American Waldorf schools raises administrative functions into the realm of management withoutensuring that the personnel are adequately trained in the two realms such a management function entails: sustainable organizational devel- opment and pedagogical dialogue. In an attemptto rectify this lack, administrators are given responsibility but not authority, the latter beingsplit between a pedagogical body and Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2financial body, a practice that leads inevitably to conflict due to the polarity that exists between these two areas of activity. This embedded con- flict potential has been exacerbated to some extent by consultants who work either pedagogi- cally or organizationally, creating what can only be seen as an artificial fragmentation of an organ- ic whole. TThhee DDoouubbllee GGeessttuurree ooff aa DDyynnaammiicc SSttrruuccttuurree Examined closely, it becomes apparent that two tri-archies are at play in the approach to gov- ernance sketched out above. One, which has amore vertical gesture, is functional and is com- posed of the three qualities: leadership, manage- ment, and administration. The other, whichensures that the three intrinsic realms of activi-ty\u2014sustainability, accountability, and creativi- ty\u2014can develop under conditions that are appro-priate to each, has a more horizontal gesture. The interweaving of the two creates a dynamic whole.Leadership must be present in all three realms of activity, yet leadership within the realm of peda- gogical creativity requires different qualities than does leadership within the realm of sustainability or accountability. The same holds true to a lesserextent for management and administration, with the administrative functions in all three realms varying least. The recognition of this double gesture raises a number of questions concerning governance in Waldorf schools: 1. Does the school have a practiced com- mitment to ongoing pedagogical dia- logue designed to enhance teachers' understanding of child development and learning? 2. In any given governance model, are the three core realms of activity structured in such a way that the different qualities ofnecessary social interaction are support- ed? 3. Is there a clear mandate system to ensure that necessary functions are addressed? 4. Does transparency exist around decision- making processes and the various formsand stages of input and feedback?5. Is there an explicitly shared will to work on the skills and capacities needed to develop and sustain forms of collegial governance? The intentional striving to develop collegial forms of governance is perhaps the noblest under- taking of our time. The realization that the skillsto meet this challenge arise only through the con- scious attempt to craft, practice, and revise such forms opens the door to much needed creativity and the research required to sustain it. EEnnddnnoottee 1. Steiner, Rudolf. Allgemeine -------------------- JJoonn MMccAAlliiccee has worked in Waldorf schools and institutes in Europe and the U.S. for many years focusing primarily on human development and thepsychology of learning. For many years a Fellow atthe Goetheanum in Switzerland, he headed research projects on curricular development and collegial lead- ership. At present he lives in Ghent, NY, where he teaches a group of homeschool students while contin-uing to work with Waldorf schools on questions of teacher development and school governance.16 \u00b7 Identity and in 2007, River Valley Waldorf School (RVWS) in Upper Black Eddy, Pennsylvania (about 40 miles north of Philadelphia), commissioned the Triskeles Foundation, a non-profit organization based in nearby Exton, to oversee a new model for in-house professional development for teach-ers, or \"peer coaching,\" a process that woulddevelop an alternative to the traditional mentor- ing process. Shortly after work began in January 2008, it became clear that the plan would necessi- tate a rededication of meeting time away from business issues and toward pedagogical concerns.This shift would require developing a more effi- cient governance model. Triskeles's original charge to help the faculty make in-house teacher development a priority led to the reorganizationof River Valley Waldorf School governance. UUnnddeerrssttaannddiinngg PPrrooffeessssiioonnaall DDeevveellooppmmeenntt Traditionally, professional development in public education involves teachers attending pre- sentations by professionals who are brought in from outside the school. Because the experts whogive the lectures often do not spend much time inthe classroom themselves or because they are not aware of local issues, their per- spectives are not always rele-vant to teachers' problems. In this model of professional development, teachers becomepassive recipients of knowledgeinstead of active contributors topedagogical improvement. A more common model of professional development inWaldorf schools is a visiting\"expert\" mentor who observes and helps a teacher but thenleaves to return to her or his own school. Another typical Waldorf school practice involves individualteachers attending summer courses or workshops.While both of these have obvious potential to deepen an individual's pedagogical practices,course and workshop content often does notmake its way into the full faculty, so opportunityfor school-wide improvement is missed. Over the past couple of decades, teachers and education professionals have been working to develop alternatives to traditional top-down mod-els of professional development. One of the most promising methods is based on the simple idea that teachers themselves are the best resource for improving classroom teaching. Called \"peer coach-ing\" or \"in-house professional development,\" thisapproach draws on the wisdom and experience of colleagues to make the educational process morehumane and effective. After being commissioned by RVWS, Mark Birdsall of the Triskeles Foundation recruitedSteven Strull, President of the National School Reform Faculty, to introduce the professionaldevelopment project. Strull, a longtime advocate of peer coaching in education, compares the ideato doctors' rounds, in which medical professionalswork through group discussion to identify andaddress patients' problems. According to Strull,traditional education is one of the only fields in which professionals are direct-ed by managers and not the other way around. This has adirect and negative impact on the quality of teaching because management decisions are notnecessarily informed by first-hand knowledge of what ishappening in the classroom. In Waldorf schools, teach- ers often highlight a different issue as the primary detriment to on-going professional devel- opment: The large amount of time in weekly meetings devoted to managing administrative details leaves little time for discussion of pedagog- L Traditional education is one of the only fieldsin which professionalsare directed by man-agers and not theother way around.

The development of a vibrant profes- sional development community would necessitatethe reform of a cumbersome governance modelthat required hours of meeting time focused on business issues. Strull led three day-long sessions with the River Valley Waldorf School faculty in the winterand spring of 2008. In these meetings, Strull shared the fundamental ideas behind the National School Reform approach and led the facultythrough a number of basic exercises. Laura Birdsall, an experienced teacher who had done consulting work for River Valley in the past, also attended these sessions and continued the project after Strull's workshops ended. TThhee PPrroottooccooll At the heart of the peer coaching model used at those River Valley Waldorf School workshops was the protocol, a written set of step-by-stepguidelines that provides a framework for facultydiscussion and ensures that it remains focusedand effective; or, as Strull defined it at his first meeting with the faculty, \"A protocol is a tool toteach yourself the habits you wish you had.\" The variousprotocols used by the NationalSchool Reform Faculty weredesigned to anticipate andaddress issues that all teach- ers encounter. Leading the group through the protocol is theresponsibility of the facilitator. Ideally someone is selected from among the members, butit can be someone from out-side the group. Strull initially served as facilitator, but the teachers quickly grasped howthe protocols worked and were soon able to facili-tate them on their own. The structure of the protocol depends on the particular problem or issue that the group haschosen to address. For example, in the\"Consultancy\" protocol, the presenter shares a dilemma that she has encountered in her work.This would be a complex problem touching on thefoundations of teaching practices. 1. The protocol begins with the presenter sharing relevant background informa- tion and then posing the dilemma in the form of a question. 2. The group asks clarifying questions of the presenter and then moves to more probing inquiries; these are meant to help the presenter reach a deeper understanding of the dilemma. 3. Now, with the presenter listening and taking notes, the members of the group talk with each other about the dilemma in light of the additional informationthat emerged through the questioning process. 4. Following the group discussion, the pre- senter responds briefly to the group's conversation, sharing how the processhas altered her perception of the dilem- ma. 5. Finally, the facilitator leads a short dis- cussion about what just took place andbrings the process to a close. Another protocol, entitled \"Chalk Talk,\" uses nonverbalcommunication to get at issues from a different angle. Itbegins with the facilitator writ- ing a question on the chalk- board. Everyone present is then able to write a responseon the board. It could be a sen-tence or a single word, or even a symbol that indicates a cer-tain relationship between otherideas on the board. All of this takes place in complete silence,and participants are encour- aged to take time to contem- plate their reactions to the original prompt. Such a \"silent conversation\" can be refreshing and enlightening, breaking long-established group pat-terns of communication. These professional tools, when effectively used, allow teachers to share the immediate peda- gogical issues with which they are wrestling. The protocols also have a democratizing effect withinthe group in that their structures ensure broadparticipation; the strong voices of the few do not By working through their problems as agroup, teachers are notonly less isolated, theyare able to bring theircollective experienceand wisdom to bear 18tend to dominate within the protocol structure. Because the content of the protocols is supplied by the teachers themselves, this model of professional development can be a meaningful improvementover the traditional mentor/mentee or the \"sit andget\" visiting lecturer formats. Discussion emergesorganically from teachers' classroom activities.\"This work helps you improve on what you'realready doing,\" Strull explains. \"It creates more meaning in what you're already involved in.\" Strull's experience in public schools is that teachers frequently respond to the pressures of their profession by withdrawing into their class-rooms and facing their challenges alone. Becauseof this, one of the foremost goals of peer coaching is to \"de-privatize\" teaching practice. This experi-ence of isolation can also be true for Waldorf school teachers and may have an even more pro- found impact on Waldorf students' experience,given that class teachers stay with their classes forup to eight years. By working through their problems as a group, teachers are not only less isolated, they are able to bring their collective experience andwisdom to bear on the issuesthey all face. But, in the end, the use of protocols to guide facultypedagogical discussions must beevaluated on whether or not they help teachers to continuallyimprove the quality of theirwork. Ideally, in-house profes-sional development will bothincrease teacher effectiveness and foster a culture of continual improvement within a school fac-ulty. The three workshops at RVWS between January and April of 2008 were a learning experi- ence not only for the RV faculty, but also forStrull, who was largely unfamiliar with the philos-ophy behind Waldorf schools. Fortunately, he found that the Waldorf school emphasis on com- munication and discourse made the use of theseprotocols a natural fit, and the River ValleyWaldorf School faculty was receptive to them. Atthe same time, Strull noted that many of theschool faculty members were accustomed to amore unstructured, open-ended form of dialogue,and consequently had to adjust to the more tight- ly controlled format of the protocol. full-time at RVWS in July 2008 and has continued to lead the work introduced by Strull. Under Birdsall's guid- ance, the school has dedicated roughly half of theyear's faculty meetings to addressing pedagogicalissues using the protocol format. The full facultychose \"assessment\" as the broad theme for the year. From September to December 2008, the fac- ulty held seven pedagogical meetings. During thistime virtually every teacher brought issues relat-ing to assessment from her or his classroom as material for group work, and most also took turnsfacilitating the protocols. An example of one \"Tuning Protocol\" session may be illustrative. In October 2008 the second grade teacher shared a description of the assign- ment of her students' first independently-written stories of the fable \"The Lion and The Mouse.\" In response to some children stating that they didn'twant to copy a story from the board but wanted to write their own story, the teacher sponta- neously divided the class intomixed-ability groups of three, and the retelling of the fable was writ-ten in these groups. The teacher'sfocusing questions were: \"Have I modeled the story retelling and writing process enough for mystudents to be successful?\" and\"What do my colleagues think ofthis assignment and the students' results?\" The protocol began with a fifteen- minute presentation by the class teacher of the step-by-step process the students were led through as they wrote their stories. This was fol- lowed by approximately five minutes of clarifyingquestions, such as: \"What were your goals? Whydid you put them in groups? While they were ingroups, were they able to ask how to spell words?Did any group have the sequence of eventswrong?\" Next, for a full fifteen minutes and with the presenter silently observing from the sidelines, colleagues examined the student work in light of Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2Many teaching methods or situa-tions encounteredare universal toteaching \u00b7 Changing Old Habits: Exploring New Models for Professional Development Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2the initial focusing questions; while examining the student work, colleagues discussed what they saw and then silently reflected and wrote notes in preparation for the warm and cool feedback peri- od. Warm feedback included the following: \"What beautiful little books they created!\" \"They must be very proud of their work.\" \"It was courageous to try something new and let go of the normal structure.\" \"This process and the finished book were a great opportunity to assess language artsdevelopment.\" \"You now know what they are capable of, and this will affect future assignments.\" Cool feedback included:\"Did the ones who struggled lose confi- dence?\" \"Without preplanning, did you miss some important assessment opportunities, suchas observing pencil grip and letter forma- tion?\" \"I am wondering/concerned that the more advanced students took over, leaving the less mature ones feeling left out.\" \"Are you clear about each child's contribu- tion?\" In the end, the class teacher reflected on the feedback that seemed particularly important andthe group debriefed on the process. QQuueessttiioonnnnaaiirree RReessppoonnsseess In January 2008, fourteen RVWS teachers who were involved from the outset were asked to respond to a questionnaire designed to gauge the effectiveness of the project up to that point. As shown in the charts below, the results were over- whelmingly positive. The teachers were given fourquestions that required a graded response from 1 (\"strongly disagree\") to 5 (\"strongly agree\"). Themajority of teachers either agreed or stronglyagreed with the claims stated in each of the ques-tions. In total, there were only three neutral and no negative responses. Teachers' written responses to the questions also demonstrate a widespread affirmation of the project's effectiveness and a desire to see it contin-ue. Asked to list the most positive aspect of thework, one teacher wrote, \"Our faculty feels like astronger unit since we began this work. We allow ourselves to become vulnerable and support our colleagues when they open up about challenges they are experiencing.\" Many teachers empha-sized how the sessions made clear the commonali- ty of their problems: According to one, workingthrough the protocols \"helped me not feel so iso- lated and bear my questions and doubts alone.\"Another confirmed the potential for learning from one's peers, stating, \"Many teaching methods or situations encountered are universal to teaching ina classroom. I gained insight from the experiences of other teachers.\" One of the survey questions addressed the matter of devoting faculty meeting time to thesein-house professional development protocols. The faculty felt that their meetings had become too exclusively focused on administrative and businessmatters, and that the school was departing from Rudolf Steiner's vision of a \"college of teachers.\" Using protocol work to reorient faculty meetingsaround pedagogical issues was thus seen as a cru-cial step toward real reform of school operations. As the chart shows, the prompt related to use of faculty time together elicited the most enthusi-astically positive response from the faculty. Onewrote, \"We are able to accomplish so much more and get along much better when we are not hash- ing it out over administrative issues! Our timetogether is much more productive.\" Another said, \"It feels so healthy to talk about why we are trulyhere and share thoughts around teaching prac-tices. The business meetings had taken us away from teaching and created tensions between us.[The new approach] has opened everyone up andmade the faculty more united.\" At the same time, a number of teachers expressed concern that thefaculty not neglect administrative issues altogeth- er. The ideal balance between administrative andpedagogical affairs in faculty meetings will have to be sought through continuous experimentation. CChhaannggeess iinn GGoovveerrnnaannccee The freeing-up of faculty meeting time for pedagogical work was accomplished at River Valley Waldorf School by a major change to thegovernance of the school. The faculty and boardof the school, working with the Triskeles Foundation, implemented a Leadership Team offour members: two teachers, the administrator,and a board member. This given and Laura Birdsall \u00b7 21 Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2authority to make all decisions for the faculty, through collaboration and consultation with their peers as appropriate. The exact composition andstructure of the Leadership Team is being evaluat- ed through the 2008-09 school year, and will be finalized for the 2009-10 year. It is interesting that a similar reorientation of faculty meeting time is underway at the LakeChamplain Waldorf School in Vermont. As at River Valley, the teachers felt that administrative work had come to overshadow pedagogical con-cerns in the faculty's weekly meetings. In order toaddress this imbalance, the school instituted a clearer division of labor between pedagogical and administrative work. Michele Starr, a class teacherand chair of the College of Teachers at LCWS,explains: \"We made a conscious decision to sepa-rate the administrative and pedagogical realms in order to bring the College of Teachers into line with Rudolf Steiner's vision of the research acade- my.\" Jon McAlice, a Waldorf educational consult- ant, facilitated this change (see McAlice, Identity and Governance, in this issue). Day-to-day decision-making is now the responsibility of the Governance Council, while the College of Teachers focuses on questions of pedagogy and curriculum.The purpose of the College is to distill the collec- tive experience of the school's teachers into rec-ommendations concerning pedagogical policy,which are then submitted to the Governance Council for review and implementation. Now in its second year, this format has allowed the school topinpoint and address areas of concern for the fac-ulty. For example, the College recently decided to devote special attention to seventh to tenth gradestudents in order to better understand these stu-dents' situation from the standpoint of humandevelopment. CCoonncclluussiioonn At River Valley, the faculty is determined to see that this new focus on pedagogy takes root in the day-to-day life of the school. \"What happens between meetings? Do teachers continue sharing?Or are the pedagogical meetings 'islands' in abusy month? With far less time spent on business,are we teachers still able to address those non- pedagogical issues that affect our classrooms?\"These questions touch the very heart of the proj- ect. As important as the group sessions are, theultimate test of the endeavor is whether or not aculture of communication and mutual support continues to strengthen at River Valley, enabling the faculty to continually grow and improve the quality of their teaching. But, for the time being, RVWS teachers have found that the open commu-nication fostered by the Waldorf school model hasbecome more focused and productive as a result of using protocols. In short, the implementation of \"in-house professional development\" or \"peer coaching\" has helped them realize one of the corevalues of Waldorf education: on-going, structuredcollegial dialogue as a means of creating a more fruitful and humane environment for students and teachers alike. -------------------- LLaauurraa BBiirrddssaallll,, MMEEddPPDD,,began Waldorf teaching as a middle school support teacher in 1979 at Pine Hill Waldorf School.

A healthy metabol-ic process makes an active human being out ofyou, and in the same way this meditative diges- tion of a true knowledge of the human being makes you an educator. You simply face the chil- dren as their teacher in an entirely different way if you have experienced what results from a gen- uine, spiritual-scientific knowledge of the humanbeing. What makes us into educators actuallygrows out of the meditative work of acquiringsuch knowledge. Such observations... if we keepreturning to them if only for five minutes a day, will bring our inner soul life into movement. Weshall produce so many thoughts and feelingsthat they will just pour out of us. Meditate in the evening upon such knowledge of the humanbeing and in the morning you will know in a flash... what to do in every case. - Rudolf Steiner Balance in Teaching22 Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 way, nor do they always heed the warn- ing implied by the concept of indication. Steinersays, in effect, \"As I see it, the nature of the prob- lem is such and such, and in the current circum- stances you might try the following startingpoints.\" The inference is that teachers should trythese out, contemplate their results, and develop their practice accordingly. This means that Steinerfrequently gives detailed exposition at higher or contextual levels of a question and sample propo-sitions for practical application. 2Indications remain fragmentary until united with relevantconcepts through meditative activity. Steiner exercised spiritual tact and moral tech- nique in communicating his research and insights. He emphasized that the modern spiritual investi- gator has to be particularly wary of acting in a way that would reduce the freedom of those who follow them. In particular, the challenge forWaldorf school teachers is the collegial co-cre-ation of forms and procedures that are reliable inthe present but capable of evolution, both dynam- ic and sustainable. The following brief quotations are examples of Steiner's indications for school administration,and they inform the discussion that follows: The real purpose of the college is to study human development so that a real under-standing of human nature is continually flowing through the school. 3 These meetings are really the living \"High School\"...a permanent training academy, as it were.4 The soul of all the instruction and educa- tion in the Waldorf School is the collegemeeting. 5 It is really true that the spiritual forces of the college are carried by the sharing ofinner scientific experience... 6udolf Steiner refers to his practical sugges- tions in a wide variety of fields as \"indications\" (Zeichen: literally, \"signs\"). Understanding what ismeant by an indication may help to explain someof the tangling to which Waldorf school collegiali-ty is prone. What does it mean that Steiner describes his propositions for the conduct of thefirst school as indications? What are the implica-tions of indications? In broad terms, Steiner's lectures and books are primarily concerned with providing readerswith the big picture, the universal dimensions of aquestion. A lecture cycle such as Education as a Social Problem, 1for example, has relatively little to say about the specifics of national or internation-al politics of the time. Steiner presents an overview of global or cosmic trends. In particular,he presents a threefold description of (in)human potential: the animalization of the body, the \"veg-etablization\" of the soul, and the mechanizationof the spirit, which he associates, in turn, with the\"East,\" \"Central Europe,\" and the \"West.\" Suchcharacterizations are powerful, but they are \"meta-statements,\" and are not directly applicable in, say, schools. To put it crudely, I do not look at my American colleagues and say, \"Ah, here aremechanizing spirits,\" nor do I conclude that myGerman friends have vegetable souls, or my Asianones animalized bodies. As a pragmatic Anglo-Saxon-Celt, there would be little purpose in my starting a campaign to halt the mechanization of the spirit; I may, however, meditate on what thismeans and attempt to bring active spirit into my relationship with material things. In addition to statements of this sort, we find, scattered through Steiner's lectures and in sourcessuch as the records of the teachers' conferences of the first Waldorf school, his indications, practicalpropositions, hints, and suggestions. These indica-tions range from relatively detailed solutions andproblems to apparently instantaneous inspirationsin the moment. Waldorf educators, however, rarely use the concept of indication in such a Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2 Developing Coherence: Meditative Practice in Waldorf School Colleges Developing Coherence: Meditative Practice in Waldorf School Colleges of Teachers CCoohheerreennccee Before developing these ideas further, howev- er, I wish to examine the question of coherence. In the sense in which I am using the word here, a coherent organization is one that closely resem- bles the functioning of a healthy living organism.The activity of each organ or process is balanced by another. In digestion, for example, stomach acid, necessary for the breakdown of food, has to be neutralized by alkaline bile, which also furthers the digestive process. Too much acidity or alkalini- ty can be detrimental to the system they serve.Healthy processes tend toward disease if they are not balanced by others. The integrity of life at each level thus consists of an interior ecology thatis related both directly and more subtly to the ecology in which the organ- ism is embedded. A rhythmic interplay of interdependent processes takes place withinthe physiology and environ-ment of an organism. Similarly, in an organization, coherence is an equivalent condition of balancing coun-teractive processes within an active constitution. Initiativecalls for accountability; free- dom of action is offset byduty to the whole; develop-ment of self is contingent onprofessional responsibility;and so on. 7 A coherent organization must integrate diverse per- spectives if it is to succeed,just as, by analogy, flour, sugar, eggs, and so on, make sponge cake. With heat, the resulting cake transcends and forms agreater whole than the individual ingredients. In a social cake, however, the ingredients, while inte-grated, are not entirely subsumed. They serve as viewpoints, or sensory organs, for the inner andouter status of the organization. Coherence is important here for two reasons. First, while Steiner's presentation of the task of aWaldorf school is coherent on the meta-level, hisindications for the practical tasks of educatingand running a school leave it to the creativity andendeavour of each generation and each teacher todevelop practical coherence for their work. Second, meditation and contemplative inquiry contribute to and increase personal and social coherence. In The Foundations of Human Experience, Steiner describes the importance of logic forteachers: Where thinking-cognition is con- cerned, humanity's challenge is to infuse this with logic. . . . As teachers you needto know about logic, even if you mustkeep it in the background in your interac-tion with the children. . . . It must bebrought to the children only through yourwhole attitude. For as teachers you willhave to be masters of logic. 8 We may call coherence a contextual logic, a thinking-feeling, or a heart-mind com- munion that informs the con-duct of education. This isimportant in a classroom, and it may be even more impor-tant in the organization of aschool. Where coherent inte- gration is lacking, dissonanceoccurs; the school is divided. As a result, the values andintentions of the curriculumare overshadowed by a \"cur-riculum\" of implicit assump-tions and relationships that communicate lessons contraryto those intended. Steiner saw the teachers' meeting as the core of the school\u2014I would say, the source of its coherence\u2014and he proposed a form of collegial action research as a continuation for the initial courses he gave before the Waldorf School opened its doors: Instead of a school director or head teacher we have teachers' meetings inwhich there is common study and com-mon striving toward further progress. There is therefore a spirit, a concrete spir- it, living among the teachers, which worksfreely, which is not tyrannical, which does not issue statements, rules or programs, Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2Where coherent integra- tion is lacking, disso-nance occurs; the schoolis As a result,the values and intentionsof the curriculum areovershadowed by a \"cur-riculum\" implicitassumptions Avison \u00b7 25 Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2but has the will continually to progress, continually to make better and better arrangements, in meeting the teaching requirements.9 Members of the staff are responsible for reflecting meditatively on their work, while contin- ual \"progress\" occurs if the staff collectively sup- ports and is hospitable to the activity of each indi- vidual. In my view, if there is a rationale for a college with a task lying beyond that of a general (or departmental) teachers' meeting, this task lies in acommitment to promote and sustain the inner ori- entation of the school. We may call this task \"ped-agogical governance.\" The work of such a collegeis thus primarily meditative, and a criterion for membership is the commitment of each individual to, we might say, professionalmeditative activity. The outer role of such a col- lege may consist of regularreview and support of profes- development, includingthe members ofstaff, peer mentoring, and colle-gial appraisal\u2014that is, to give concrete expression to \"the will continually to progress, continually to make betterand better arrangements, in meeting the teaching requirements.\" There is no requirement that such a college be separate from a general teachers'meeting\u2014it depends on the temper and constitu- tion of the school. Accordingly, membership in the college may involve a statement of intent predicated upon the\"pedagogical imagination\" given by Steiner at the foundation of the first Waldorf School. Such a statement may take a form similar to the following: I wish to join with you in contempla- tive inquiry, in the service of the goodspirit of our time. I do so with good intentand striving toward the ideals and princi- ples of Waldorf education to the best ofmy ability. My intent is to set aside, infreedom, personal ambition, and to act, tospeak, and to conscientiously reflect onour collective work for the betterment ofthe young people in this school and in thewider world. 10How to Know Higher Worlds and Steiner's other work on the subject demonstrate clearly that meditative development calls for and stimu-lates increased personal coherence. 11Certain car- dinal virtues or qualities of mind, for example, areattendant on inner work: Enhanced qualities of attention, equanimity, and intention, and with them, internalvirtues or conditions, such as mental andphysical health, responsibility, gratitude,and patience; Virtues, such as reverence for the world; and Enhanced capacities for perception, includ- ing awareness of and receptivity to spiritualrealities. Regardless of college consti- tution or function, however, the activity of contemplative inquiryis key in keeping in view the aspi- rations of a Waldorf school.Members will treat questions related to the core purpose of the school as a process of contempla- tively informed action research. AA CCoolllleeggee aatt WWoorrkk A mundane example will highlight the practi- cality of the meditative engagement of a college of teachers. Examples of this sort may challengecoherent action. They may attract fly-swarms of self-interest. Yet the ability of a school body towork through complex, if matter-of-fact, issuessays a great deal about its ability to make betterarrangements for teaching and learning. A number of teachers in a small Waldorf school observed that the children in their classes tended to appear pale and tired at the end ofsome school days and less so on others. Other staff members reported an element of fractious-ness, particularly when their classes had after-noon language lessons. The College discussed this and decided to study the question. Two members of staff, seen as among the most neutral, one having a mainly administrativerole in the school, were appointed to facilitate the process. At an open, organized meeting, teachersshared observations. Language teachers were con- sulted and student work from language lessons[T]he activity of con- templative inquiry iskey in keeping Developing Coherence: Meditative Practice in Waldorf School Colleges of Teachers held in the morning was compared with work completed during the afternoon. One member of staff prepared a summary of this research, and another offered research on the theme of diurnal rhythms, drawing from Steiner's suggestions andcurrent research on metabolic rates in young peo- ple at different times of day. Another member of staff compiled and conducted a survey of staffand older pupils. Much work took place in otherschool meetings, including the general staff meet- ing and meetings with parents. As a result of this work the question was asked: \"Should we change the timetable [schedule]to take more account of daily rhythms?\" Members of the College resolved to contemplate the question and return to it at the next weekly meeting. Following further communication, the decision was made to find a way to move language lessons and certain other topics out of the afternoons so far aspossible, replacing these with lessons involvingcrafts, artistic practice, games, and other more active lessons. A member of the school's personnel team was delegated to discuss the matter withpart-time teachers and others who would be affect- ed by the change. The finance team was asked to assess financial implications of this decision. The colleague responsible for this was asked to draft a timetable implementing the change. The outcome was a decision to make a small modification during the summer term for the younger classes, where concern was greatest, with a more complete change to be implemented at the start of the new school year. Following implementation, the new arrangements werereviewed at mid-term. This review included a study of the effectiveness of academic lessons in the subsequent school year. As result, the new timetable was confirmed and further alterations proposed, including a pro- posal to establish a \"multi-crafts afternoon\" com-bining the four older classes in ways that provided a greater range of activities\u2014drawing in skilled members of the wider school community\u2014andmade more efficient use of teaching strengths. Here are the components of this example: A question distilled through contemplative inquiry Observation or evidence-gathering, including appropriate formality and record-keeping Collegial reflection without any attempt to connect these or arrive at concepts. Thisinvolves the exercise of moral tact as col- leagues invite one another to listen forimplicit or explicit assumptions. Where these enter the conversation, an attempt is made to reverse the flow into the sphere of observation. In order to do this, specific training may be helpful. Torin Finser, for example, describes a training exercise of this sort, used in his Leadership Training Program, in School Renewal . 12 Collegial reflection, now with the aim of rec- ognizing inter-connected images or events Meditation or reflection on these intercon- nected pictures Decision Implementation Review Adjustment The process prior to decision begins and ends with meditation, and may therefore be recursive, a lemniscate. The results of one pass through theprocess may become the beginning of a newprocess.

Its systematic and effective practice provides a model for building an associative and collegial founda-tion for coherent school function. Finally, this model provides a heart-centered process capableof enabling effective self-evaluation, peer- appraisal, and school development. FFoooottnnootteess 1. Steiner, Rudolf.

Consensuson the school's mission, therefore, is criti-cal to the long-term success of theprocess. - Larry Lezotte Seven Correlates part one (Research Bulletin XIV, 1, Spring 2009), I looked at four signs of the zodiac that are related to the process of human incarnation, and I will now look at four signs that Rudolf Steiner relates to will activity of human beings.2When we look at our life of will, our earthly endeavors, we may turn to the images contained in the signs of Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces.3 In order to approach our life of will in respect to self- education, we may remind our-selves that Steiner speaks of liv-ing with an openness to whatlife brings and with a gesture of gratitude and acceptancetoward destiny. This openness is present in young children when they play freely, without preconception or plan. The process is important,not the outcome. Children surrender to the flow of play. In the same way, we adults may stand in the stream of life, open to what approaches us. Because we live in a time that has a tendency to one-sidedness, to regulation and restriction, we may be tempted to educate according to a fixed plan rather than drawing upon life and its activi- ties. We may divide education into specializedareas, or we may become fettered by guidelines, government regulations, and accreditation requirements. In a kindergarten, a teacher may prefer certain kinds of play and restrict others,regulating what should not be regulated. Children's play may appear unsettled to us but itmay not be so in the children's own experience. We may be imprisoned by our own good inten-tions even in such areas as guiding children's play, and we may reflect on our work frequently, aloneor with colleagues, to assist us in overcoming ourprejudices in this area. Steiner often describes the one-sidedness of materialistic thought and a conventionally scien-tific approach to understanding human beings. As a result of the restrictions and limits of these points of view, children may sense something like a feeling of deprivation. The truly human may appear inaccessible, which in turn may lead to melancholy. 4Children then come to school as if they are carrying a heavy load, joyless, burdened, and tired. One of the remedies for this melancholy is an experience of adults at work. If we welcome children into the stream of our activities and if we are presentin what we do, then the chil-dren may experience us ascomplete human beings. They will find what they are lookingfor. Through our activity, we also build up what we may call a field of warmth in which children may rest and in which they may experience closeness to another human soul. Work creates a warm, active closeness, withoutburdening the children prematurely with emotion-al sentiment. Steiner speaks about what will happen if we take children into our sphere of will activity: But this living interest, devotion, and sympathy will be there if at the right agewe permeate all branches of our teaching and education with the principle of imita- tion.... What is lacking is the power toenter into the spirit of nature, the spirit of the cosmos, into the universe as a mightywhole. This power must be regained. 5 SSiiggnnss ooff WWiillll We return now to the image of the zodiac and the four \"will signs\" of Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. Interestingly, Steiner claimsthat these signs do not directly influence our Deep within all children ... is a great longing toexperience truth in thedeeds and words ofthose around them.Part II Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2 Teachers' Self Development as a Teachers' Self Development as a Mirror of Children's Incarnation Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2deeds. According to Steiner, we may picture human beings standing on the earth with the zodiac signs from Aries to Scorpio in a semicircu- lar arch above us. But the signs from Sagittarius to Pisces have to be envisaged as if below our feet, going through the earth to the other side of it. The earth sphere thus separates the human being from these zodiac signs. Their influence is indirect and weaker than the influence of other signs, and this weakness leaves us free for activityof will. Through the willed activity of our limbs wemay create something new; in the activity of our heads, by contrast, in thinking, cosmic influences are active. 6 Steiner describes the qualities of Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, andPisces as related to archetypal forms of human activity. Often, however, we no longerdirectly see or participate in these archetypal forms. Weturn to older civilizations inorder to discover these activi-ties: hunting, animal breeding, tilling the soil, trading and traveling. To the stars down there on the oppo- site side, which are covered by the earth, human beings owe their existence ashunters (Archer), animal breeders (Goat), tillers of the soil walking across the field carrying urns to water the fields (WaterCarrier); and we are traders thanks to the part of the starry heavens that takes usacross the seas\u2014in far distant timesboats were built to look similar to fish,and two ships side by side that havesailed the seas in pursuit of trade are the symbol for trade. ...In the past, people really had a feeling for the way the humanbeing is connected with the universe andthe earth. 7 Over time, we have evolved many more occu- pations than these, but it is not our task to relatewhat we do now as adults directly with thesearchetypal endeavors. Steiner says that in moving into the age of the fishes (Pisces), the age in whichmodern industrialized civilization has developed, the \"four honest occupations\" have been some- what modified. Children's consciousness does notyet correspond to our modern consciousness, however, so it seems appropriate to turn to these archetypal activities in kindergarten work. SSaaggiittttaarriiuuss:: TThhee AArrcchheerr,, tthhee HHuunntteerr The image of Sagittarius consists of a human head and torso melded with the body of an ani- mal, a horse. We know this figure as the centaur,a being half man, half animal. The centaurreminds us of the lower nature of a human being, as yet untransformed. The activity of Sagittarius, according to Steiner and to the myriad images in art and litera- ture, is hunting. I would like to add \"gathering\" as well, as it may be seen as a hunting of plants. Hunting and gathering are earlyoccupations, but they live on tothis day. A business person, for example, is a hunter and gather-er who seeks out good markets,gathers, and resells. Even thoseof us who are not business per-sons may enjoy \"bargain hunt-ing.\" As teachers and caregivers we may demon- strate hunting and gathering during the walks and outings on which we take children. We maydemonstrate genuine interest in our surroundings,gratitude for what we find, and joy in the beauty and richness of the world. We may also cultivate gathering in harvesting fruits and vegetables. Gathering what the earth gives us and finding or hunting for treasures are important activities for young children. We may take children toplaces where valuable things can be found innature. But we also see children gathering toysand piling them up in a classroom. Hunting and gathering are part of children's archetypal play.Some children hunt for treasures, some for specifictoys, and some may even snatch what others have. This last is an unrefined hunting gesture. A hunter and gatherer may be tempted by his lower instincts, acting for his own advantage. The activity of hunting, however, may also be honest and it may become ennobled.

Children look for truthfulness in our actions, for truthfulness in the materials we offer them, and for truthfulness in how we think and speak. As adults we may examine unrefined aspects of our souls and learn to better know our-selves. Truthfulness, in this respect, means that we do not delude ourselves as to the quality of our work, as to who we are, or as to our progressin spiritual learning. 8 CCaapprriiccoorrnn:: TThhee GGooaatt--FFiisshh The image of Capricorn is the goat-fish. It has the head and torso of a goat and the tail of a fish. Capricorn is an expression of the activity of ani- mal breeding, which followed, historically, the stage of hunting and gathering.9The goat-fish looks like a mis-bred creature; its appearance may make us uncomfortable. It reminds us of the diffi-culties of animal breeding, and, especially today, of genetic engineering and cloning. We take greatrisks in breeding plants and animals. We changenature on a deep level and, therefore, require a highly developed sense of responsibility and courage to enter these unknown realms. This was as true in the past as it is in the present; although lifein the past was simpler, the immediate consequences of breeding could include famine and disease. A direct and positive aspect of breeding is that we have to provide care for what we have bred.Animal breeding as an archetypal activity serves the purpose of developing human qualities of car-ing, looking after one another, providing comfort, and nursing those who are sick. It embraces the entire range of care-giving and social professions. This is an archetypal human gesture, and it is intrinsically connected with the breeding of ani- mals. We could say that the caring professions arederived from the work of animal breeders. Education belongs here, clearly. Breeding can be, then, for good or ill. We may, for example, try tomodel children to suit our own intentions, or wemay facilitate children's development without try-ing to determine the outcome in advance. Some children, at a young age, engage in acts of caring and, also, act out caring for others intheir play. Such role-play as mother and child, ordoctor or nurse and patient, demonstrates anarchetypal quality. Maria Luisa N\u00fcesch describessuch play and shows how she models caring for others by participating with her students:Nine children play together, the teacher is sitting close by, sewing. Three girls live in a house made from cloths. One is cooking and distributes \"coffee and soup.\" One is shopping. This girl buys so many things that the house becomes very full and at last there is no room left \"to be\" in the house. This girl is ceaselessly busy. She hastwo hunting dogs, two boys who wanted toplay as well, but did not dare to offer them- selves as father or children. These dogs soon became ill, one of them seriously. One dog'spaws were limp; the other dog had a brokenleg. The owner remained detached in the face of this suffering, still shopping busily. \"You can look after them,\" she said. Then the teacher started to nurse the sick animals, put cream on their limbs and bandag- es. More and more animals came, all very ill.Some died and the teacher covered them with a cloth. But luckily new puppies came forthfrom under the cloths. The dog owner nowquickly became a little kitten herself, newlyborn. The kitten was blind and roamed about for a long time. Then the blind kitten camevery close to the teacher who had resumed the sewing. The kitten wanted to sleep very closeby. The kitten slept very restlessly and neededto be caressed and calmed down again and again. 10 We may ask whether or not it is appropriate for a teacher to become so involved in children'splay. In this example, the children expressed theirneed for special loving attention and care throughtheir play, and N\u00fcesch sensed that behind a rough outer fa\u00e7ade was a needy child. Individual moralintuition guides such actions and determines theway we act for the sake of a child or a group ofchildren. The virtue related to the sign of Capricorn is courage, not necessarily in the sense of bravery orheroism, but in the sense of accepting mistakes, accepting the truth even if it hurts, enduring blows of destiny, and never giving up. Courage is the determination not to go backward or \"drop out,\" but to remain engaged even when a situa-tion is difficult. This courage to go forward and learn from mistakes is important for a teacher because children may, at times, stagnate in theirBulletin Teachers' Self Development as a Mirror of Children's Incarnation Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2development or even appear to regress. Kindergarten offers teach- ers many opportunities topractice courage. Often the nearly overwhelming amountof selflessness required to edu-cate young children makes it hard to keep going. This is true of all caring professions. Theinner strength to keep going isthe practice of the virtue of courage. AAqquuaarriiuuss:: TThhee WWaatteerr CCaarrrriieerr In respect to the image and activity of Aquarius, Steiner says: Agriculture is represented by the Water Carrier. There is a certain spiritual justifica- tion for thinking in terms of water, butwhat matters is the way he walks across the field. He holds an urn in each hand andpours water from these. This is the garden- er and the tiller of the soil. 11 Cultivating the land involves activity of will. In our time we have rediscovered the importance of caring for the land. Today's environmental move- ment reminds us of our responsibility for the well- being of the earth. The image of the water carrier may also induce us to think about nurturing theetheric forces of human beings and of nature. In early childhood, this work often takes the form ofa teacher gardening at playtime, watering plants,digging soil, weeding, and planting, often with thehelp of some children. I remember a strongly built boy in my kinder- garten whose grandfather ran a nursery. During a home visit, this child took me into the nursery and proudly and precisely explained the working of the watering system. He was totally at homethere and his grandfather had been the model of the gardener for him. This had gone deeply intothe child's body. When we watered plants in thekindergarten, he was immediately present. Watering was not a chore for him; it was \"in hisblood,\" a natural activity. In other activities andin his conduct, this boy was phlegmatic, and itwas otherwise difficult to motivate him to do any-thing that demanded effort. Through this boy, I learned how deeply the work of an adult sinks into the uncon- scious, bodily responses of achild and how this \"slipping into\" the adult through imi- tation brings about anintense activity of will, one that we may not reachthrough mere instruction. The virtue of Aquarius is the virtue of silence and discretion, the virtue ofpausing, observing, waiting, and then judgingwisely. From silence, in discernment, correct decisions may be found. 12A gardener knows the value of waiting and the danger of prema- ture action. By waiting, he improves his ability to make the right judgments regarding theplants in his care. He ensures fertile soil, a good yield, and seeds for the following seasons. Kindergarten teachers and caregivers are well advised to do the same, not to step in too quickly to resolve conflict, not to react too quickly when a child has done something wrong. We may step back for a brief moment of inner silence and then act when our immedi- ate emotional reactions will not blur recogni- tion of what has happened and what is need- ed. We learn to wait so that we do not fall intosuperficial educational activism. The practice of silence and discernment may develop into the practice of meditation. Looking quietly at a leaf becomes part of anunderstanding of all that is behind the happen- ings in nature. If we are silent and discerning,we will be better equipped to calm a noisy,restless group of children. To become still in the middle of chaos is a challenge for an adult.When we can do this, children can connectwith us more easily because they sense oureffort to understand. PPiisscceess:: TThhee FFiisshheess Steiner explains the sign of the fishes as the image of two boats sailing together across the sea.

They are also adventurers and risk takers. Risks are always present when we widen our field of activity. In Pisces it is not so much trading that concerns us, but traveling, widening our con- sciousness. Young people travel a lot these days.We live, after all, in the age of Pisces. Children may be drawn to traveling in their play: creating means of transportation and travel-ing in various kinds of vehicles, including boats,trains, airplanes, rockets, trucks, cranes, and frontend loaders. Here is an example from an early child-hood center in Bangkok: A group of six boys had turned a table upside down, attached cords to it, and pulled the tableacross the floor as a carriage. The work was hard. The tabletop dragged on the floor and the carriagewas heavy with children sitting in it. The boys man-aged to get a blanket underneath it so the carriagewas easier to pull. After many rides, the carriage became a car, pushed along by one child. A child playing a parking lot guard with a whistle stoppedthe car and waved it professionally into a parking slot. The child imitated this perfectly. In another part of the room an upside-down table became a moving truck and was loaded with big furniture\u2014three freestanding shelves used to hold toys were loaded onto it, as were other, small- er things. The load was secured with lots of ropes. Next to the truck, three girls set up a food shop. The truck started moving, endangering the shop, so theshopkeepers packed up quickly and moved to a big table farther away. The shop was re-established ontop of the table, but soon moved under the table,where it stayed until the end of playtime. The chil-dren did not complain of having been disturbed in their play by the moving truck. The virtue related to Pisces is magnanimity. Steiner describes magnanimity as moving beyondoneself and out into the world. It includes goingbeyond our personal wishes, feelings, and attach-ments. Children need to experience adults who canopen their souls widely and embrace the children, their parents, and the school community. Steiner suggested that we read the news and hold eventsinwardly, even if this is difficult and painful. Thepractice of magnanimity, of a wide-open heart,increases our ability to love. Steiner speaks, too,about not passing by our fellow human beings without bothering to know them. 14Love cannot be demanded or forced. It has to grow and be given freely. But magnanimity and developing interest in other human beings can be practiced for the sake of our fellows. CCoonncclluussiioonn This completes the picture of the four spiritual virtues of our will: truthfulness, courage, discre- tion, and magnanimity. They have in common thegesture of inner openness, and openness to the spiritual world, a practice of devotion, is part ofthe gesture of Aries. Openness and magnanimityare the beginning of the practice of love in theface of the needs of the earth. Aries and Pisces: these two belong together as the beginning and end of a journey through landscapes of thethinking-feeling soul and the working fields of will. EEnnddnnootteess 1.

A national survey by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported that eight percent of stu- dents in grades 9-12 tried to take their own lives,and seventeen percent reported \"seriously consid- ering\" suicide. These troubling statistics reflect symptoms of a deep unhappiness afflicting chil- dren from all backgrounds. 2 The remedy to this soul- toxic condition is a strength- ening of the self so thatyoung people are able to emerge from adolescence as self-directed, emotionally sta-ble, social beings. The task of providing this inner training once belonged to the community\u2014to church, fami- ly, and neighborhood life. This is often not the case today, and schools are asked to fulfill these needs. As humanity evolves we recognize the surge toward individualism, and we can glimpse the preparation for the emergence of the conscious- ness soul. It is a light streaming from the futureand a pathway with no detour. In the future, wewill experience the experience of others; we will be unable not to do this. In spiritual science this post-individualistic stage is referred to as develop-ment of the \"spirit-self.\" 3This higher soul state is predicated on emotional health and inner balance. SSoocciiaall--EEmmoottiioonnaall EEdduuccaattiioonn Cognitive researchers4point out that chil- dren's social-emotional development is as impor- tant as their intellectual and physical develop-ment. Our emotional life may also be called our life of instinct. It responds before thinking com- mences and it can even extinguish thinking. Children's emotional health affects their academic performance, and their academic performance affects their emotional health. In other words,depression, anxiety, and unhappiness impairschool performance. Similarly, school failure con- tributes to emotional health problems.ry to remember the days of September ... and your school experiences. For the majority of us,what we were taught and what we remember from our school years present two different pic-tures. We sat through countless hours of lessons about common denominators and mitosis, aboutheliotropism and split infinitives, about world rev-olutions and the Industrial Revolution. Our skills developed qui- etly in the background at arate equal to our interest. In the foreground, like aguardian to a fortress, wasour feeling-life. Our emo-tions set the stage for ourlearning. Early memoriescontain the many sweet recollections of childhood but also feelings of intimidation suffered on the playground, the loneliness we felt as we tried to figure out who we were, awkward, blundering moments with the opposite sex, victories and defeats, and the antagonism we felt towardadults who seemed so sure in their correctness. As we matured, perhaps, we swam in a sea of insecu- rity lifted by waves of hope. In this area of our life-education, we were often largely on our own. We should not leave emotional education to chance, however, in a world in which culturaldecay and the dominance of modern media have created toxic soul conditions in which today's chil- dren must fight to survive. In western societies the drift to greater individualism raises the question of the future social coherence and sustain- ability. The increase in family fragmenta- tion with a dramatic rise in the divorcefigures places new emotional strains on a child, faced with feelings of insecurity andrisk over which they are powerless. 1 Across our country, one in ten children suffers from a serious mental health disorder, and very Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2Children's social-emotional development is as importantas their intellectual andphysical development. Social-Emotional Education and Waldorf Education Waldorf Education Ant\u00f3nio Dam\u00e0sio, a neurosci- entist from the University of Southern California, researches the neurobiology of mind andbehavior with emphasis on emo-tion, decision-making, memory,communication, and creativity. Hehas shown that, in the brain, emo- tions and thinking are not sepa-rate activities but constantly play into one another.\"Emotion appears to be the support system without which the rational building process cannot work.\" 5 The prefrontal lobes of the brain, which are associ- ated with emotional impulses, are also associatedwith working memory and learning. Linda Lantieri puts it this way: Educators and parents alike are [becoming] much more aware that when chronic anxiety, anger, or upset feelings intrude on children's thoughts, less capaci- ty is available in working memory toprocess what they are trying to learn. This implies that, at least in part, aca-demic success depends on a student's abil- ity to maintain positive socialinteractions. 6 Children's social-emotional skills drive them to learn to communicate, to connectwith others, to resolve conflict,and to cope with challenges. These skills give children the confidencethey need to reach goals and theability to persist in the face of life'sdifficulties. Like other importantmilestones that babies and tod- dlers achieve in their first three years\u2014such as uprightness, walk- ing, and talking\u2014developingsocial-emotional skills takes time,practice, and patience of parents and teachers. In school, the firsttask of a wise teacher is to engage the \"feeling-life\" of the class in the subject being taught; thisinterest opens neural pathways to allow for cogni-tion. The champions of social-emotional inclusion claim an intellectual pedigree stretching back to Aristotle, who described emotional control and understanding as vital virtues. Aristotle wrote:Humankind is by no means agreed about the things that ought to be taught, whether we look to virtue or the best life. Neither is it clear whether education is more concerned with intellectual or with moral virtue. The existing practice is per- plexing; no one knows on what principlewe should proceed\u2014should the useful inlife, or should virtue, or should the higherknowledge be the aim of our training; all three opinions have been entertained. Not all people have the same opinion about what youth should learn in order todevelop a good character or to enablethem to lead the best life. There is also noconsensus about whether education shouldmainly focus on acquisition of knowledgeand understanding or char-acter formation, whetherthe right type of educationshould consist of disci-plines useful for life, tobreed a pure character, or to enlarge knowledge. 7 Around ten percent of American grade school andhigh school students now receive some form of social and emotional learning curriculum, accord-ing to the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL), aChicago-based emotional learningresearch organization. 8Supporters point to a growing collection ofstudies that show the benefits ofemotional learning programs oneverything from test scores to low- ered anxiety and lower rates of drug use. But the ultimate goal issomething larger: a redefinition of what school is meant to teach andwhat sort of knowledge we value. Emotional literacy campaigners argue that the problems of the American school system will not be solved by getting youth to readsooner or training them to find the Okefenokee Swamp on a map\u2014they need to better understand,and take charge of, their essential and unique human qualities. Daniel Goleman contributes significantly to views of education when he addresses the need to Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2Children's emotional health affects their academic perform-ance, and their 36David S. Mitchell \u00b7 37 Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2nurture the social and emo- tional lives of children. In Emotional Intelligence he sum- marizes research from thefields of neuroscience andcognitive Board examinationsin importance for children's development andfuture life success. He identifies five components that can be translated into essential social-emo- tional aptitudes: 1. Self-regulation\u2014conducting ourselves and controlling our emotional 2. Self-consciousness\u2014recognizing and under- standing our feelings; 3. Motivation\u2014managing feelings in order to achieve our objectives; 4. Empathy\u2014identifying and decoding the feelings of others; and 5. Social Abilities\u2014relating to and influencing others. 9 Additionally, social-emotional education classes address five age-appropriate and essentialareas of social and emotional development: 1. Self-awareness\u2014recognizing our capaci- ties, strengths, emotions, and values; 2. Self-management\u2014managing emotions and behaviors, persevering in overcomingobstacles; 3. Social awareness\u2014demonstrating under- standing and empathy for others; 4. Relationship skills\u2014forming positive rela- tionships, teamwork, and conflict resolu- tion; and 5. Responsible decision-making\u2014making ethi- cal, constructive choices about personal and social behavior. \"The emotional mind is far quicker than the rational mind, springing into action without paus-ing even a moment to consider what it is doing,\"according to Goleman. 10Students need to learn that they have the ability to make choices in how they respond to their individual emotions andthey must learn to understand what these emo- tions are in order to lead richer lives. Goleman adds that students should learn self-awareness, in the sense of recogniz- ing feelings and building a vocabulary for them, and seeing the links between thoughts, feelings, and reactions [think- ing, feeling, and willing]. They shouldunderstand whether thoughts or feelings are ruling a decision and [be able to] see the consequence of alternative choices.They should be able to apply theseinsights to decisions about such issues as drugs, tobacco, and sex. Self-awareness also takes the form of recognizing your strengths and weaknesses, and seeing yourself in a positive but realistic light. Another emphasis in managing emo- tions [is] realizing what is behind a feeling(for example, the hurt that triggers anger), learning ways to handle anxi- eties, anger, and sadness, and followingthrough on commitments. A key social ability is empathy, understanding others' feelings and taking their perspective, and respecting differ- ences in how people feel about things. Relationships are a major focus, includinglearning to be a good listener and ques-tion asker, distinguishing between what someone says or does and your ownreactions and judgments; being assertive rather than angry or passive; and learn- ing the art of cooperation, conflict resolu-tion, and negotiating compromise. 11 Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry sums up much of this in The Little Prince : \"It is with the heart that one sees rightly: What is most essential is invisible EEdduuccaattiioonn aanndd SSoocciiaall-- EEmmoottiioonnaall LLeeaarrnniinngg development toward physical, behavioral, emo- tional, cognitive, social, and spiritual maturation.\"12 Research on graduates of Waldorf schools has documented how the Waldorf schoolcurricula already contain many of the attributes Daniel Education and Waldorf Education of a strong social-emotional curriculum.13Still, we can do more. Schools must broaden the scope of the term \"education\" to give it its full meaning, and social-emotional education must be con-sciously taught. Resources are available, but, first, it is vital to understand child development; this isan area neglected in Goleman's work. Second, wemay study our curricula inorder to determine whereemphasis can be placed tostrengthen social-emotionalskills. And, third, we may focuson the demographics of age-appropriate social-emotionaldevelopment, which may varyfrom community to community. Waldorf school curricula have much embedded withinthem to help form the moralwill of students. \"In the learn- ing process, the creative-expressive, aesthetic dimension has a [secure] place alongsidethe dynamics of the data-driven, knowledge-basedglobal society, because the arts provide a bridgethat promotes the inner and outer health and well-being of the individual.\" 14Rich stories and biographies of men and women provide mentalimages containing powerful ideals toward which our students may strive. Respectful teachersafford students an opportunity for moral imita-tion. We may speak without moralizing about the dangers of cigarette smoking during combustionexperiments in 7th grade chemistry, for instance, as well as about depression and the physiological effects of alcohol during 8th or 9th grade chem-istry. True relationships and responsibility are unfolded as requisites for sexual intimacy, and procreation is looked at with wonder. Our students are in need of a more direct development of their social-emotional skills, espe- cially once they reach high school. Parents may have been diligent and class teachers may have laid a strong moral foundation, but the influencesof modern life, as experienced, for instance,through music, the cinema, and arrogant athletes,eat away at this foundation as a strong acid attacks metal.EEmmppaatthhyy At the foundational stage, social-emotional education concerns itself with acquiring self- knowledge. The words \"know thyself\" were inscribed in the pronaos(forecourt) of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, and meta-cognition (aware- ness of thought process), meta-mood (awareness of one's own emotions), and self- awareness (the sense of anongoing attention to one's inter- nal states) were trained in themystery school of Pythagoras.Situated in Crotona, a town next to the Gulf of Tarentum in south- ern Italy, the school was highly concerned with strengthening the morality of society. Memberswere required to live ethically, love one another, share politicalbeliefs, practice pacifism, anddevote themselves to the mathe- matics of nature. These timelessconcepts return to humanity with the regularity of a merry-go-round and set thefoundation for modern spiritual work as well associal-emotional education. At the secondary stage, social-emotional edu- cation concerns itself with the cultivation ofempathy\u2014from my perspective the most impor- tant and necessary capacity for our times. Empathy is the \"potential for holding still [the]eternal oscillation between sympathy and antipa- thy\" 15\"...and in this deed of holding still, making a space, a gateway open[s] toward another per-son and toward [this person's] experience.\" 16Thus we give up ourselves and begin to experience the other person's experience. The attainment of empathy is a condition for achieving total com-passion. Thomas Weihs describes empathy as fol- lows: While love is often impatient, empathy is patient.While love is often aggressive,empathy is kind.While love is often generous, empathy envies no one.Love is often proud,but empathy is never boastful nor conceited.

Mitchell \u00b7 39 Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2While love is often selfish and very easy to take offense, empathy is never selfish and never takes offense. Empathy keeps no score of wrongs, nor does not gloat over other men's sins, but delights in the truth. There is nothing empathy cannot face, There is no end to its own faith, hope, and its endurance.17 CCoonncclluussiioonn Twenty-five years ago Waldorf high school teachers could enter a classroom and, so to speak, find the table set, as if in preparation for a won-derful meal. For the most part, students were rela-tively attentive, manners were exercised, and there appeared to be an eagerness to learn. When teachers enter a classroom today, they may wellfind they have first to set the table and meet thepressing emotional needs of the students beforethey can serve the meal\u2014that is, teach the class.High school teachers in 2009 are often required to prepare students in a new manner before teaching can commence. This is not to say that they do not want to learn. Here, for example, Leo Tolstoy describes the torment of the underachieving pupil, Seryozha: The father and the teacher were both displeased with Seryozha, and indeed he studied very badly. But it was quite impossible to say that he was an inca-pable boy. On the contrary, he was much more capable than all the other boys. And, as his father saw it, he did not wantto learn what he was taught. But in facthe could not learn it. He could not because there were demands in his soul that were more exacting for him than those imposed by his father and teacher. These demands were conflicting, and he fought openly with his educators. He was nine years old, he was a child, but he knew his own soul, it was dear tohim, he protected it as the eyelid protectsthe eye, and did not let anyone into hissoul without the key of love.

Brain research indicates that emotion and cognition are profoundly interrelated processes. Specifically, \"recent cognitive neuroscience findings suggest thatthe neural mechanisms underlying emotion regula-tion may be the same as those underlying cognitive processes\" (Bell and Wolfe 2004, p. 366). Emotionand cognition work together, jointly informing the child's impressions of situations and influencingbehavior. Most learning in the early years occurs inthe context of emotional supports (NationalResearch Council and Institute of Medicine 2000).\"The rich interpenetrations of emotions and cogni- tions establish the major psychic scripts for eachchild's life\" (Panksepp 2001). Together, emotion andcognition contribute to attentional processes, deci-sion making, and learning (Cacioppo and Berntson1999). Furthermore, cognitive processes, such asdecision making, are affected by emotion (Barrett et al., 2007). Brain structures involved in the neuralcircuitry of cognition influence emotion and vice versa (Barrett et al., 2007). Emotions and social behaviors affect the young child's ability to persist in goal-oriented activity, to seek help when it is needed, and to participate in and benefit from rela-tionships (California Department of Education, http://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/cd/re/itf09socemodev.asp). 5.

The position of the \"activist-academic\" that I inhabit on these issues is a far from comfortable one4\u2014not least because academics are often sus- picious, if not condemnatory, of those of their ilkwho engage in public campaigns that commonlyinvolve challenging head-on the governmental policy-making process. In my view, the myth of a value-free, uncommitted, even detached social sci-ence was comprehensively undermined way back in the 1970s, 5so it becomes important, even essential, to be open about one's own, inevitablypartial position so that a reader is able to locate the arguments developed in the commentary. I write as a professional psychotherapist working from an existential-phenomenological,post-modern, and transpersonally informed sensi- bility, who trained as a Waldorf school teacher in the late 1990s because of the malaise I was wit- nessing in children's lives, and the life-long impact that children's toxic early experience can have. Iam particularly concerned about the impact ofmodern technology, and especially Information and Computer Technologies (ICT), on the psychesand the very being of both children and adults. Since 2006 I have been directly involved in several public campaigns centered around theissue of so-called \"toxic childhood,\" named after fellow childhood campaigner Sue Palmer's highly influential book of the name\u2014and it was Palmerand I who co-orchestrated the Open Letter ontoxic childhood that appeared in the British Daily Telegraph in September 2006, signed by 110 prominent public figures, and which quicklybecame a major news story across the globe. Inthat letter, we wrote:s I write (March 2009), two prominent Reuters press reports on the effects of television have highlighted the controversial and mounting concerns about the place of a ubiquitous televisualculture in children's lives. First, we read a summary of a report published in Pediatrics Surveys that finds \"TV may do no harm or good to babies\" and view-ing TV before age two \"has no impact on learningability.\" This is, of course, a particularly controver- sial area, with surveys showing around two-thirdsof babies under two viewing some screen media ona typical day, 2and the American Academy of Pediatrics' widely reported recommendation that children under two should never watch screen media.3Around the same time, Reuters also reports \"Too much TV linked to higher asthma risk,\" show-ing that sedentary behavior associated with TVviewing could cause developmental changes in thelungs, this being the first study to directly link very young sedentary behavior to a higher risk of asth-ma in later childhood. These two studies are merely the latest in a growing body of evidence that is beginning to fleshout empirically the kinds of somewhat anecdotal,\"from principle\" arguments set out in books likeMarie Winn's path-breaking The Plug-in Drug. Such research findings certainly raise all kinds of thorny methodological questions\u2014and, not least, the kindsof (often self-fulfilling) assumptions that such empir- ical, arguably positivistic research routinely makes. A case in point is the question of the time-scale of such research, for another study (cited by Comstock and Scharrer) found that more TV viewing at age three correlated to less verbal ability at age six. In any reputable psychosocial research, it is essential to tease out the underlying metaphysical axioms that inform and, often unwittingly, direct one's con-ceptualization of the key research questions. One grave danger in this particular field is that televisualtechnologies have become so culturally ubiquitousand taken for granted that they are treated uncriti- cally as a \"given\" or baseline datum, rather than asa phenomenon that should itself be open to funda- A Television in, and the Worlds of, Today's Children A Mounting Cultural PM \u00b7 Television in, and the Worlds of, Today's Children: A Mounting Controversy Since children's brains are still develop- ing, they cannot adjust\u2014as full-grown adults can\u2014to the effects of ever more rapid technological and cultural change. They still need what developing human beings have always needed, including...real play (as opposed to sedentary, screen-based entertainment), first-hand experience of the world they live in and regular inter- action with the real-life significant adults intheir lives. They also need time.... They arepushed by market forces to act and dress like mini-adults and exposed via the elec- tronic media to material which would havebeen considered unsuitable for children even in the very recent past. 6 Across the globe a veritable \"paradigm war\" is now unfolding, centered on childhood, between,on the one hand, a technological \"modernity\"which, its critics claim, is characterized by one-sided materialism, scientistic and commercial val- ues, a crass utilitarianism, an unquestioned ideol-ogy of \"progress,\" and an inability to recognize that children are not \"mini-adults,\" but human beings with a distinct mode of consciousness and way of being. On the other side of the paradig- matic divide are those, like me, who believe that children's well-being is being fundamentally com-promised by these seemingly inexorable cultural trends, and that we need urgently to reclaim our own conscious capacity actively to create humanculture, rather than be mere passive victims of itsnoxious vicissitudes. There are many levels from which the issue of television's influence upon children's experience can be interrogated, all of them important, and Ican address only several perspectives in this short piece. Most fundamentally, perhaps, there is the philosophical perspective. Primary experience, gained through the senses, is our most basic wayof understanding reality and learning for our-selves. For the late philosopher Edward S. Reed,Cartesian rationalism has \"captured\" us scientifi- cally and socially; yet it is direct contact with theworld that most significantly influences our devel-opment, by helping us develop and refine ourinterpersonal and physical skills. 7Our hyper- modern technological culture, it is argued, tends to favor the indirect knowledge gained from sec-ondary experience, in which information is select- ed, amended, packaged, and then presented to us by others, with everyday life becoming ever-more artificial\u2014and with television-viewing being per- haps the paradigm case of such secondary experi- ence. Reed joins other cultural critics and researchers like Neil Postman,8Barry Sanders,9 Jane Healy,10Aric Sigman,11and Baroness Susan Greenfield12who, in their different ways, maintain that unprecedented technological progress has led to a considerable regression in meaningful com- munication between people. All these authors cau-tion that second-hand experience has become so dominant in our technology-dominated lives thatprimary experience, and all that goes with it, is under grave threat. They offer, instead, a vision ofmeaningful learning that places far greater emphasis on unmediated experience and the nec- essary messiness of real-life experiential learning. Calling for a better balance between first- and second-hand experience, for example, Reed argues that without opportunities for direct experiential learning, we will become less likely to think and feel for ourselves. It is fascinating and sobering that long-term empirical research is now begin-ning to confirm this philosopher's grave predic- tion, in terms of an observable and marked decline in children's and young people's thinkingabilities. 13Reed's work is a development of the telling critique of technology developed byphilosophers like Martin Heidegger 14and Wade Sikorski.15The observed degradation of authentic play and imaginative thinking is highly relevanthere, too. I maintain that the wider cultural perspective on TV-viewing and its all-pervasive neurological, psychological, social, and societal-cultural effects,demand our most urgent attention\u2014and at leastsome of these wider questions are not at all easily amenable to the kind of positivistic, empiricist research that dominates the field. There are, asmentioned, increasing reports in the literature of unexpected long-term declines in both children's competencies in certain key areas, and in higher- education students' thinking abilities; and in her book The Plug-in Drug, Winn quotes evidence strongly suggesting some kind of causal relation-ship between the rise of TV-viewing in the USA from the 1950s onward and notable and other- Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 44Richard House \u00b7 45 Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2wise difficult-to-explain declines in standardized test scores among American youth.16 Touching on these issues, cultural commenta- tor Carl Honor\u00e9, in his new book, Under Pressure , writes: Endless channel-hopping... militate[s] against the slower art of delving into atopic, staying with an argument longenough to unravel its nuances and com-plexities.... University professors increas-ingly complain that twenty-first centurystudents balk at reading whole books....They also seem impatient with ambiguity, demanding instant answers that are black and white.... Can democracy function properly if young voters want every issuewrapped up in text-message-style sound bites? 17 Can we, finally, lay responsibility for these disturbing educational and cultural trends at the feet of the ubiquitous television\u2014or is TV merely one instance of a wider, routinely uncritical, andnon self-reflexive \"technology toxicity\" that now seems to be having measurably negative learningeffects on our children? These are the kinds of questions that researchers, educationalists, cultur-al commentators, and philosophers need toaddress if we are to make healthy and informed steps toward consciously chosen, people-sensitive, and humanity-enabling technology (see Freenberg,1995), rather than allow an increasingly runaway technology to dominate humankind in the \"man-becoming-machine\" age of Late Modernity. To end on a controversial note, it may well take a full consideration of the spiritual and thetranspersonal dimensions to achieve this essential engagement in and around technology in Late Modernity; 18and, in that eventuality, even those who are skeptical about the spiritual dimensionmay have to begin to take it seriously\u2014certainly if it proves to be the only viable way out of our current technological morass and spiral of cultural decline.EEnnddnnootteess 1.

And the government still uses fear to control its people\u2014in the past two years, more than thir-ty Russian journalists critical of the governmenthave met an untimely, often cruel death, victims of apparent assassination. In the past, the Czars and Russian Orthodox Church amassed extravagant fortunes at the expense of the common population, who we pic- ture as struggling to exist on little more than crusts of stale black bread. The failed experiment of communism sought to remedy and balancethese inequities, only to follow the same path of repression and cruelty. Members of theCommunist Party and the political elite prospered while the people suffered the deprivation of failedsocial and agricultural experimentation. The country was unprepared for the advent of perestroika and the consequent entry into a free-tandardized testing poses an escalating problem for Russia because, as a consequence of its new free market economy, the state no longer supports freeeducation and the cost of schooling students is pro-hibitive. The editors of The Pedagogical Journal of Bashkortostan University, Ufa, Russia, recentlyreprinted \"Assessment Testing:Protecting Childhood Research Bulletin (Volume XIII, #2, pp. 21-30).Ufa, located west of Moscow in the Republic of Bashkortostan and just east of the Ural Mountains, has its own Waldorf school. Founded as a fortress on the orders of Ivan IV in 1574, the city originally bore the name of the hill upon which it stood, Tura-Tau. Locals nicknamed the city Ufa, meaning \"small\" inTurkic, and the name stuck. In 1802, Ufa became the principal city of Bashkiria with more than six major universities. 1David Mitchell met with the editors and interested academics in Moscow this past summer. To understand the problems of education resulting in high-stakes testing in Russia, we must try to penetrate the Russian psyche and its deepconnection to the land. Russia is a diverse countrycomposed of many varied folk groups, includingSlavs, Tartars, Muslims, Armenians, Norsemen, and Azerbaijanis. Russia is a unique state, influ-enced by both European and Asian cultures. With what we may call an inherent inferiority complex as a nation, Russia has long felt a need to findrespect in the world. Peter the Great copied Versailles in St. Petersburg and decreed that everyRussian shave his beard in order to appear moreEuropean. Catherine the Great assembled thegreat art collection in the Hermitage in order toimpress the world. Still, today, the longsufferingRussian soul pines for prestige and recognition.

Mitchell Dramatic sky at sunset over dachas on the Volga River Russia's History, Culture, and the Thrust Toward High-Stakes Testing market economy. The \"common wealth\" was dis- tributed to everyone in stock receipts. Not know- ing what to do with these pieces of paper, private citizens sold them cheaply to enterprising individ- uals for hard cash, giving rise to a new generation of oligarchs while, at the same time, the new gov- ernment kept no reserves to make social servicesavailable. Basic elements of society, such as real estate, education, and health care, became com-modities that people could not afford. The value of the ruble collapsed, common people lost theirnewly acquired money, and the country's econo-my went into a tailspin. Strong leadership wasneeded to regain control of the country's vast nat- ural resources and stabilize its fledgling economy. Vladimir Putin, former head of the KGB, assumedthat role. During my recent visit to Russia, I asked three locals how their new government and elected leg- islature were doing. They all replied similarly: \"The politicians meet in the legislature in order to see how they can make things even more difficultfor the people!\" The expansive Russian countryside is rich in nature wisdom from the North. Matrushka dolls, an ancient fertility symbol, are found everywhere,as are stories of pagan rituals and atavistic festi- vals in the birch forests. These vast forests stretch endlessly, as do the broad steppes, and the sky isa panorama of dramatic changes. Simple dachas\u2014summer homes or retreats\u2014line theVolga River with richly carved wooden windowframes, doors, and eaves. Most have not seenpaint for at least forty years and are near col-lapse. They serve as a metaphor for life in gener-al. The structure of Russia needs repair and care. The countryside is a picture of abject poverty. Imet several people who were foraging in the forest for mushrooms and berries in order to survive. Many of the elderly receive only meager social services and beg on the streets for subsistence.I heard stories of soldiers begging a meal because the government could not afford to pay them or feed them sufficiently. On the other hand, St. Petersburg and Moscow are thriving and impressive cities, bustling with restoration and new construction.Moscow, a huge city with population of over 12.6 million residents, 3suffers from congested, pot- hole-riddled roads and too much traffic. Delays are painfully long. Food in Moscow, currently theworld's most expensive city, is a third more costlythan in the United States; a modest hotel charges between $700 and $2,400 per night for a room.

The Russian people have suffered for cen- turies. Possessing rich soul qualities\u2014a love forpoetry, music, and literature\u2014they have reser- voirs of devotion. How will the transformation of these qualities manifest in the future? An example of their devotional emergence from communist control can be seen in the symbolism of their newnational flag. I asked a university professor about the meaning of the flag's three colored stripes. He replied: \"The white stripe is for the purity of the spiritual world, the blue stripe is for the majestyof the Russian sky, and the red stripe is for the blood of Christ.\" Russia's free market economy formed toward the end of the 1980s during the transition between Michael Gorbachev's perestroika and Boris Yeltsin's reforms during a time of great hope andchange. Change was also called for in the Russianeducation system, which lacked innovation andcreativity and was strongly ideological, bureau-cratic, and technocratic. For a while the slumber- ing devotional life awoke and the values embed- ded within Waldorf education were recognized. The first Russian Waldorf schools were found- ed in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Ryasan, Shukovsky,Yaroslav, and Samara. An interest in a free and humane education grew until about thirtyWaldorf schools (five in Moscow) and many assorted Waldorf kindergartens were peppered across the country. 4 During this time the schools multiplied and found success. In 2006 the central governmentinvited schools and individual teachers to presenttheir curriculum ideas in a nationwide contest. The largest Waldorf school in Moscow, called \"School 1060,\" won a prize in this educational competition of one million rubles (about $30,000) as a \"School of the Future.\" This school has morethan 300 students in eleven grades. 5 An initial period of optimism and expansion of Waldorf education in Russia gave way to a period of serious challenges and some contrac- tion. The challenges faced by the Waldorf schools in Russia included these: the struggle againstchanging government regulations based on man-dated curricula; economic instability and rentalcosts; escalating tuition costs, from $50 per month to $800 per month (the high end well beyond the means of an average Russian family);and inadequate teacher salaries ($200-$700/month). 6As elsewhere in the world, the government sought to control education by man- dating standardized testing because it believed that student learning could be accurately meas- ured, albeit at the expense of individualization. During the 1990s, as the economy collapsed and expenses skyrocketed, the Waldorf schools entered a fight for survival. School 1060 had to decide if it wanted, like most independent schoolsin Russia, to become a private school with hightuition rates or become a state school. The school Moscow as seen from University Hill Waldorf school in St. PetersburgTrevskaya Russia's History, Culture, and the Thrust Toward High-Stakes Testing decided in 1996 to register itself as a state school and accept 40% financial assistance. Initially, the newly empowered Orthodox Church had supported Waldorf education, but this ceased when church officials realized that the schools promoted independent thinking. For awhile, the Church reversed its initial support and viciously attacked the concept of Waldorf educa-tion, but these attacks seem now to have abated. Most likely, the Waldorf schools will have renewed opportunities in the future when they work more actively at the local level rather than at the national level. In order to be recognized, state Waldorf schools now have to pass an inspec- tion to gain their license and be registered. To gain a license a school must have premises that accordwith state regulations; it must also be regularlyinspected and show that its teachers are compe- tent. For registration it must prove for three agegroups that its pupils are at the same educational level as comparable children in state schools. 7 Strangely, overall Russian standards have yet tobe set, so registration depends heavily on the local authorities of the eighty-nine Russian regions. I observed, everywhere, constant change and revision. People can never be too sure that any policy will last very long. Everything in Russia appears to be in flux and in need of repair, andthe common people continue to suffer and waitfor future improvements. If the yoke of standard-ized testing could be removed, then future popula- tions could be counted upon to bring the imagina- tion and clarity needed to solve many of Russia'sproblems.

Teachers at the school are always eager to learn more and to incorporate aspects of Waldorf techniques; how- ever, language, geography, and financialresources have limited their access to informationand formal training. Perhaps most critically, the educators at the school embrace an emphasis on multiple and var-aldorf education came to the Soviet Union in 1991, when the first kindergarten to employ Steiner methodologies opened in Moscow. 1 Slowly, and largely through the work of individual educators dedicated to the cause, the concept ofWaldorf education has spread throughout Russia,and a small but growing number of Waldorf insti-tutions has been established in cities and towns across the country. This proliferation has, in part, been possible thanks to the efforts of international volunteer organizations, like the Germany-based Friends of Waldorf Education. 2In Russia, Waldorf schools are sometimes public but often private, and they are largelysustained on the energies of parents and educators who believe strongly in a system of free education and who go to great lengths to preservethese opportunities for their children. When I began my research in Russia as an anthropology studentin 2005, I did not intend to studyWaldorf education. Instead, as an advocate forand ally of peers with disabilities at home, and as a longtime student of the Russian language, I setout to learn about the notion of disability inRussia, and about what\u2014if any\u2014strategies and movements were unfolding in the sphere of disabil-ity rights. By chance and circumstance, I visited the small village of Petrushka, 3a few hundred miles north of Mongolia and two hours from the nearest city in the Russian Republic of Buryatia. There, I spent several weeks as a researcher and participant observer at a tiny local school for chil- dren with disabilities, whose educators found theirinspiration in the Waldorf school approach. Thus, Icame to this topic not as a practitioner or scholarof Waldorf school methods, but as an anthropolo- gist interested in the ways that individuals withdisabilities and their advocates were making senseof the uniquely deconstructed social realm in the former Soviet Union, and working to overcome W Da, Valdorvskii!

Finding an Educational Approach for Children with Disabilities in a Siberian Village ied types of intelligences. They identify intellect, myshlenie, located in the head, feeling, chuvstvo, located in the torso, and will, volya, located in the limbs, as modes of intelligence to be developed in each child. In keeping with a Waldorf school cur- riculum, each part of the day at the school is spe-cially targeted to work with one of these types oflearning. During the first half of the day, the children activate their thinking and reasoning. In the after-noon, the students\u2014the teachers refer to their pupils as \"our children\"\u2014do the- ater, painting, and music, all ofwhich are considered to be related to feelings and expression of emo-tions. They also practice basketweaving, beading, clay- and wool- and wood-working, all of whichfocus on the hands, and the chil-dren's capability to use their ener- gy productively. All of the toys in the school are handmade. Sophia recalls that, at first, they had many toysmade from brightly colored plas-tics (Chinese black market goodsare the most readily available mer- chandise in Ulan Ude, and, as aresult, in Petrushka). When aWaldorf educator from Irkutsk visited, she wasadamant that they be replaced with natural, handmade, creativity-inspiring toys. Later, on a tour of the school during my visit, Sophiaexplained to me that she had eagerly implement- ed this advice, and investigated the underlying philosophy. The teachers at the Chrysalis School employ these and other aspects of Waldorf philosophy that they have amassed from distant sources to fit their needs. TThhee LLooccaallee Petrushka is a tiny village along the Trans- Siberian railroad, somewhere north of Mongolia, just east of Lake Baikal (that long sliver of water a blip on the globe, halfway between the Baltic Sea andthe Pacific Ocean). Six hours by train from the near-est major airport in Irkutsk, and an hour and a halfby train from the regional capital of Ulan Ude,Petrushka is little more than a dwindling settlement. Once a factory town established during the mid-20th century as the Soviet Union pushed to settle and develop its Eastern Territories, the peo- ple of Petrushka were supported by government- run steel and concrete factories that manufac-tured building supplies and railroad parts to bemoved by train to outposts eastward. Like the fac- tories, everything in the town\u2014from the apart- ments people lived in to the grocery stores, schools, and land\u2014was state property, and all business was administered from above. Then, in the 1980s, the Soviet experiment began to fall apart. Food shipments to the village grewincreasingly insufficient, environ-mental hazards (from mining, oiltransport, and nuclear energy endeavors) increased, there wasn't enough housing, and, bit by bit,paychecks from a floundering cen- tral government became fewer and more sporadic. 4 Chaos descended on the town; with no money and no supplies,the already limited possibilitiesavailable to the residents greweven slimmer. Because goods and farm products were distributed via centralized channels, the work per- formed had no market value, and the products had no consumer base. Life came to a stop duringthese years. The factory paid its workers, if it paidthem at all, in flour; whole families survived on the potatoes they could grow; the collective farms which raised pigs and cattle were without the infrastructure needed for continued production.Many residents turned to alcohol. Today, women of the village will state matter-of-factly that dur- ing that period, many men, faced with insur- mountable odds, committed suicide or simplyabandoned their wives, children, and aging par- ents. Society deteriorated to the extent that, when I arrived in the village in 2005, numerous buildings on the outskirts had been abandoned and fallen into disrepair, running water was considered a lux- ury, and hot water had ceased to flow through the pipes in the apartment buildings. Petrushka was a lesson in survival\u2014of what people do whenthey have nowhere else to go.

Hartblay \u00b7 53 Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2At the time of my fieldwork the town had lit- tle that hadn't existed in the 1980s: three small stores that sold groceries, one with practical homegoods and clothing; a bread factory; a chick- en farm; the railroad repair dispatch; one public school housing grades one through twelve; apharmacy; a post office; a three-room medicalclinic; and not much else. The Chrysalis School itself is located in a building that was once a music school. When that project was abandoned, the building becameproperty of the state. The Chrysalis School staffpetitioned the local government and gained per- mission to restore and use the building in 2001. For mothers of children with disabilities in this town, a number of challenges emerged that left them with few options; this changed when theylearned of and began to implement Waldorf meth-ods. While the mothers themselves had always felt that their children were beautiful, valuable individuals, authority figures and cultural mores all pointed to the contrary. In stories that the mothers working at the Chrysalis School told me,several specific barriers to inclusion arose repeat-edly. First, they were faced with the economic and social challenges of perestroika and the early post- Soviet period, described above. 5Second, the pri- mary medical response to the birth of a child with a disability and the inadequate resources and insulting attitudes of many of the doctors, werefrustrating, to say the least. Third, they faced the difficulties of educating a child with disabilities in Russia. These were, chiefly, limited or inadequate special education options, and the economicallycritical conflict between childcare and work that a parent faced when her child could not attend school. All of these issues worked together to render disability a comprehensive crisis in the lives of these families. Sofia, the director of the school,told me many stories of the difficulties sheencountered raising her son, Vova, who was born developmentally delayed. He was often ill as aninfant and was eventually diagnosed with DTsP. 6 Thus, Sofia recalled feeling immense relief and a sense of revelation when, in attending a seminaron the principles of Steiner education, she heard,for the first time, a stranger say that a child likeher son could be educated and could become acontributing member of a community. Vova is now a healthy and rambunctious, if still highly vulnerable, young adult. MMeeddiiccaalliizzaattiioonn aanndd SSttiiggmmaa iinn IInnffaannccyy aanndd hospitals, for any indi- vidual, is so sparse that family members are expected to care for the ill, preparing their meals and washing their bed linens; the bulk of personal care and attendance, in the West assumed by nursing staff, is, in the Russian Federation, borne by the family. Sophia's recollections of her son'searly childhood frequently included the phrase, \"One time, we were lying in the hospital...\" and went on to detail a particularly harsh episode ofsickness, or an altercation that Sophia had had with a nurse or doctor. Russians regularly use the idiomatic expression of literally lying in the hospi- tal, but Sophia's use of the plural (\"we werelying\") is unusual, and indicative of the degree towhich she shared in her son's experience of hospi- talization. Sophia recalled a particularly soul-crushing experience from this period. She had requested a referral from a doctor for Vova to visit a physicaltherapy center, but the doctor's response was, \"Your son is too disabled. Why should the statespend money on a child that will never be rehabili- tated?\" Embedded in this statement is a notion of rehabilitation that implies the goal of total nor- malization of difference or impairment. The goal of medical and educational treatment as provided by the state is to restore individuals to a level of social normalcy and functionality that rendersthem indistinguishable from the larger population; such a model leaves no room for difference, or forsocial integration of individuals with special needs. It also indicates that for a mother of achild like Vova, giving up the child to state care is the only course of action supported by the profes-sionals around her. Raising a child with specialneeds as part of her family and community wassimply not an option offered to Sophia. The horrid conditions in many Russian chil- dren's homes (where both special needs childrenand orphans are housed) are well documented.Sophia later wrote, \"How could I possibly have put my child into a home for invalids, knowing what went on there? Even now they \u00b7 Da, Valdorvskii! Finding an Educational Approach for Children with Disabilities in a Siberian Village to the children there. It is like sentencing a child to a long, slow death.\" But, in seeking to raise Vova in the community, Sophia found herself with sparse resources and little guidance. The Russian sociologist Elena Iarskaia- Smirnova has conducted research with mothers of disabled children in the city of Saratov, and writes, \"Sources of help for families raising chil- dren with disabilities that are well established in the West\u2014such as books and other reading mate- rials about raising a child with a disability, parent support groups, and education for parents\u2014areabsent in Russian women's narratives.\" 7Her research reinforces the pervasiveness of stories ffoorr YYoouunngg CChhiillddrreenn Sophia's story began in the early 1980s, when she learned that her newborn son was \"sick.\" By the age of one, Vova had been diagnosed with DTsP. During the difficult years of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Sophia was lucky to beemployed as an assistant teacher in the local pre- school; likewise, her husband was lucky to beemployed in the factory, which continued to func- tion in bankruptcy, unlike the collective farms sur- rounding the settlement. By the time Vova was seven, Sophia's hus- band had died, leaving her a single parent strug- gling to provide for her two children. When she worked at the local preschool, she brought herchildren to work with her. She was constantly negotiating daily problems. When Vova was stillunable to walk steadily at the age of six, she found him a tricycle, which became his self- propelled wheelchair. When Vova was denied entry into the first grade at the local school, which had no special education facilities, shenoted a policy clause that allowed Vova to stay atthe preschool until the age of nine. Most important, the necessity of earning income often came second to caring for children.Her position at the preschool was as an aide,rather than as a head teacher, and the schooloften could not pay her. So, for years at a time,Sophia lived off meager state benefits and thekindness of neighbors in order to stay at home with Vova. She was often hungry, and she strug-gled to feed her two children. Sophia told me, \"There is not yet any devel- oped system of special education in public schools in Russia.\" After a moment, she added, \"Well, maybe somewhere, but not here.\" Generally, an attitude persists that there is no space for childrenwith special needs in an already under-fundedpublic school system. Teachers are not trained orexpected to include children with special needs intheir classes. Some children may attend classes with their peers and receive a certificate in placeof the regular diploma. Two instances of this approach in Petrushka known to me both yielded poor results. Although the children sat in classesbeside their peers, they were largely ignored byalready overwhelmed teachers and learned little. The parent-educators at the Chrysalis School all had stories of failed educational attempts. LikeSophia, Tanya, whose daughter has learning dis-abilities and speaks little, addressed her lack of childcare by working in a kindergarten herself.After kindergarten, at age seven, the childrenwere eligible to apply to a state-run specializedboarding school, called an internat. By all reports this institution was as terrible as the name sounds. One mother, Maria, told me that while her daughter Anya was living at the internat, dur- ing her visits home she would hide bits of breadunder her mattress. When, after nine months inthe internat, Anya had forgotten the alphabet, which she had previously known, Maria quit her job and brought her daughter home again. \"No, Idon't like to be a stay-at-home mom,\" she told me, \"but there weren't really any other options.\" Thissentiment was a common refrain among the mothers whom I interviewed. PPaarrttiiccuullaarr CChhaalllleennggeess Like any other identity, disability is very much a reflection of the cultural values of the broader society. Thus, while there are many similarities between the stigma and hurdles that people with disabilities and their caretakers face in Russia andthe United States, there are also many differences. Two key issues are these: 1) The (lack of) develop- ment of a tradition of civil rights legislation, and2) The (lack of) development of a broad-based sense of the desirability of diversity. In the United States, a tradition of civil rights legislation in answer to popular movements hasbeen developed through struggles such as those for racial equality, gender equality, same-sex mar- Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume S.

There is no equivalent civil legal tradition in Russia, and the Constitution of the Russian Federation is a recent document with little history of being upheld in court; likewise, the judicial sys- tem itself is sorely undeveloped, and the very pro- fessions of lawyer and judge continue to be heldin low esteem in Russian society. The Constitutionof the Russian Federation guarantees equal educa- tion for all. With no system of special education, already under-resourced schools, and slimly paid teachers, however, few schools and parents have even been made aware of this right. Likewise,with no history of education-related legislation, it will be a slow process to bring this standard intopractice. (One group that has been fighting for advances in this realm is the Mental Disability Advocacy Center, or MDAC. 8) There has also been little success in building a tolerant, inclusive public sector in Russia, whetherin regard to racism, sexism, or ablism (\"able-ism\" discriminationagainst those disabled in someway). These \"isms\" remain pow-erful forces. In the United States much effort has been exertedover the past thirty years toinclude tolerance lessons in the everyday curricula of schools and to value these rights in hir- ing decisions and work-place communications, but in manyforums of Russian public life, sim-ilar efforts have only recentlyattained even a precariousfoothold in the Russian Federation. (This has occurred primarily as international business has taken root in Moscow, implementing Western human resource policies. For example, cosmopoli- tan values have led journalists and other media professionals to introduce politically correct lan-guage.) The majority of people with whom I spoke about disability continued to use what, in transla-tion, amounts to outdated and derogatory lan-guage, i.e., \"invalids,\" \"mental retards,\" and so forth. In the past years, there has been an observ-able increase in the use of mindful phrasing (e.g., \"people with special needs,\" in Russian, lyudi sogranichyenimi vozmozjnoctyami) in journalism and general audience publications. While advocates adopt these phrases as they look to international disability rights movements for guidance, they are beginning now to become a part of the broader lexicon. TThhee IIrrkkuuttsskk MMooddeell \"By the dictates of the culture, in American education, everyone must do better than everyone else. Of course, this is both logically and socialstructurally impossible,\" write educational anthro- pologists Ray McDermott and Herv\u00e9 Varenne. 9In Russia, however, that is not the case. Rather, the system has been established to differentiatebetween talented, high achieving students and those who do not excel. Unlike American schools,which encourage students to pursue numerous fields (i.e., perform in school theater productions,play on the soccer team, study trumpet, and per- form academically) at their whim, Russian stu- dents are encouraged to pursueone field in which they aredeemed to be particularly talent-ed. Most Russian school childrenreceive the equivalent of C and D grades in some subjects, which is not seen as a failure, but simplyas an indication that they are not leading their peers in this area.Unfortunately, by extension, those students who are consid- ered to be low achievers are leftunassisted, and children with spe- cial needs that require additional support are not included in main- stream education at all. In Russia, as in the United States, a Waldorf approach to education offers a radically different student and parent experience from the public school system. A Russian education journalexplained in 2000: What is the difference between Rudolf Steiner's and the traditional approach tochildren's education? First, Waldorf schools' vision implies maximal develop- ment of individual talents of every givenchild. While at a regular school a teacherplays the role of the all-knowing strictThis was the first time ... that [Sophia] hadheard people talkingabout disability as afact rather than acurse, the first timethat she had found acontext in \u00b7 Da, Valdorvskii! Finding an Educational Approach for Children with Disabilities in a Siberian Village master ruling his absolute knowledge into his students' brains, at a Waldorf school a teacher is the wise tutor who helps chil- dren find answers to the world around them. A Waldorf school eliminates the dis- tance between the teacher and the schol- ar. No marks to evaluate the quality of knowledge. Therefore, students are never classified by grade. No \"good boys\" and \"bad boys,\" no \"successes\" and \"fail- ures\"\u2014which are, in fact, stamps that sometimes stick to children for the rest of their days. As the result, children feel more liberated; and they are free to express their emotions.10 Unemployed for two years during Vova's childhood, Sophia used this time to invest in herson's development. Although he was not enrolledin school, she insisted that he learn. She set up special tutoring sessions for Vova after-hours with an elementary school teacher. She sat with himfor hours until he solved simple arithmetic prob-lems. Gradually, other mothers began to bring their children to Sophia's apartment for \"school\" in the early afternoon. Sophia recalls sitting forhours with three or four kids, going through the alphabet over and over again. Eventually, Sophia's commitment to her role as teacher led her to take correspondence coursesand attend conferences in the city of Irkutsk. When Vova was about twelve, Sophia attended a confer-ence at which she learned of aschool and living community forpeople with disabilities outside thecity of Irkutsk that seemed toanswer her unanswered questions. The school, Talisman, which is inter- nationally and privately funded,has adapted a Waldorf approach tothe needs of children such as hers. This was the first time, she told me, that she had heard people talk-ing about disability as a fact rather than a curse,the first time that she had found a context inwhich her son could be valued. Sophia set out tocreate such a school in her own town. The very notion of a place in the community specifically for their children was radically new. The local preschool tolerated and allowed theirpresence, while the internatkept these children separate from the rest of the world and did not nurture the children as individuals. The idea offered a powerful change of perspective and a potentially dramatic improvement in quality of lifefor children and parents alike. With about five local families on board, and more expressing ten- tative interested, Sophia set out to find funding for the venture. FFoouunnddiinngg CChhrryyssaalliiss The settlement of Petrushka has a small local administration. By discussing her plan with the single town social worker (who was chiefly responsible for disbursing social security pay- ments to veterans, the elderly, and the disabled in the town), Sofia began to spread the word. Eventually, her plan gained the ear of anothergovernment employee in the regional administra-tion office, an hour's journey from the village. \"Ihelped her out, and she helped me out,\" Sofia explained to me. \"She needed a new program on her list of accomplishments for the year. I needed money.\" And so, Sofia obtained money enough, with intense frugality, to pay herself, to hire three teachers, and to serve one meal a day to the chil- dren. They claimed the small, empty building, ren-ovated the rooms, scavenged for furniture fromtheir own apartments and from friends, and col- lected toys and other supplies in a similar way. Though Sophia's vision was of a school, her fundingcame from an administrativebranch not involved in educa-tion called the \"Department for the Protection of Women and Children.\" Thus, in the eyes of the state, Chrysalis is consid-ered not a school, but a\"Center for Rehabilitation of Disabled Children,\" with all thelinks to medical and socialservices that this title implies. To Sophia, her peers, and the children, however, the space is patently aschool. Despite the implications of its funding, the reality of the distance between the administration and Chrysalis, as well as Sophia's status asDirector, allowed the daily workings of Chrysalisto be entirely based on the needs of the partici- Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2The teachers at the Chrysalis Schoolemploy ...

This results in \"hiding\" overage and underagestudents in school records andwhen regional administrators visit. Similar contests may ariseregarding the structure of the day and the educational philosophyemployed in lessons. At Chrysalis, children may attend the school with permissionof Sofia, usually as a result of their mothers requesting that their child be enrolled, although occasionally a relative or a teacher at another school may make this request.Once enrolled in Chrysalis, children may attend aslong as they or their family members wish. Some children attend for a summer or a year, while oth-ers have never known any other school. The space has increasingly served as a resource for women who have given birth to chil-dren with special needs, as the older women working there take on mentoring roles. Oftenwomen with infant or toddler children who have been identified with special needs visit the school, which, despite the limitations of its funding, is very much aligned with the broad mission that drives Sophia and the other educators. As Chrysalis has become increasingly stable, its funding renewed year after year and its ties with educators and the Waldorf School in Irkutskstrengthened, it has begun to be recognized as an institution in the broader community. Neighbors notice that Chrysalis has brought jobs, and thus increased stability and commercial opportunity tothe town, and that the social network that has grown around the school provides an important safety net. One neighbor, the English teacher atthe town school, told me, \"Sofia has done a lot over there. Not only has she made a place forthose kids to go, but she has helped out the moth-ers a lot\u2014jobs, support.\" Neighbors also turn to Chrysalis with problems. For instance, they asked Sophia to take on two children, three and fouryears old, who, neglected by alcoholic parents,were roaming the town hungry and mistrustful of people. After six months at the school, the chil- dren appeared healthy and func- tional; Sophia planned to contin-ue working with them (off thebooks) indefinitely or until theymoved to the town school forfirst grade. The Chrysalis School has also begun to bring the languageand fundamental concepts ofequality and sensitivity concern-ing disability to the remoteregion. Local newspaper cover- age has identified the strong con- tribution that the school makes to the lives of its students, against all odds. The articles are a valuable source of publicity for the school and a significant step toward spreadingcompassion and acceptance of people with dis-abilities in the region. CChhaalllleennggeess TTooddaayy Despite the growth of Chrysalis since its establishment in 2000, there is still a gap between what the school provides and what the communi- ty needs. The limitations of state funding, theproblem of a growing number of students olderthan eighteen, the lack of support for the stu- dents' future lives as adults, and the constant negotiations with funders have led Sophia and theothers to begin seeking other models. \"This time, we will not use government money,\" Sofia told me. Instead, the women hope to build a self-sufficient community. They envis- age a workshop, farm, craft center that will become a home and place of employment forChrysalis graduates. In many ways what Sofia and her colleagues seek to build is a Camphillcommunity, 12an inclusive and self-sufficient col- lective with its roots in Steiner philosophy. There is already one such community in Russia,Camphill Svetlana, 13located outside of St. Petersburg, which is officially allied with the inter- national Camphill movement. The Chrysalis col- lective's plans, however, are based on the modelof Talisman, 14a similar but unaffiliated communi- ty outside of Irkutsk. The Chrysalis women plan to grow much of the food that they will consumeI was awed by the determination of thisgroup of women wholooked beyond thepossibilities offered tothem in \u00b7 Da, Valdorvskii! Finding an Educational Approach for Children with Disabilities in a Siberian Village both at the school and at the new center; in addi- tion they plan to sell handicrafts and hope eventu- ally to own a cow and a horse. The Chrysalis collective will face significant challenges in establishing such a community in Petrushka. For their plan to be realized, they will have to implement a successful entrepreneurial enterprise and garner income through farmingand selling handicrafts and baked goods. This is adifficult goal to accomplish considering the levelof poverty facing the general community inPetrushka; whether their neighbors will havemoney to spend and goods tobarter remains to be seen. Likewise, they are far from the only ones seeking to supplementtheir income by selling milk, cheese, baskets, and so forth, acommon practice in many post-Soviet communities, 15and these micro-enterprises often fail toreach sustainable levels. A further possibility for bol- stering the sustainability andsupporting the start-up cost oftheir so-called Butterfly Garden would be to secure funding through an NGO. Chrysalis, however, like many rural grassrootsorganizations in Russia, has few connections tosuch resources. With neither Internet access nor English language skills, and no knowledge ofgrant writing or the workings of non-governmen- tal service organizations, this possibility remainsout of reach. They are not alone in this problem. Scholars have noted, \"The population at large haslittle if any idea of the why and how of interna-tional assistance for NGOs work. It would be in the interest of both of those giving and those receiving grant money if this situation were tack- led.\" 16It should be added that the domestic non- profit sphere in Russia has only just begun to devel- op, even in major cities, and the concept of philan-thropy in general is largely absent. At present, plansfor the Butterfly Garden will continue without sup- port from non-governmental sponsors. When I was last in Petrushka, I saw that a building had been reclaimed on the outskirts oftown and was being renovated as a new commu-nity center. The building was in horrid disrepair. Aformer kindergarten building abandoned for lackof children during the darkest days of perestroika, it had long sat empty as an ad hoc barn for roam- ing cows and a gathering place for local drunks. But it was large, had a solid foundation, a size- able area of adjacent farmable land, and\u2014mostimportant\u2014 it didn't belong to anyone else. A team of parents and teachers began scheduling group workdays to clean up the land and to repairthe roof, the windows (which had long ago beenknocked out and broken at the sills), and the floor (which had fallen through to the foundation). The team began petitioning the regional administra- tion for rights to the building andland. And, as a collective, theyplanted their first crop of pota-toes, which, I am told, they har-vested the next fall. CCoonncclluussiioonn As a young anthropologist encountering courage in the face of severe poverty, I was awed by the determination of this group of women who looked beyond thepossibilities offered to them in order to build, in the Chrysalis School, an exemplary community and learningenvironment. The parent-educators' integration of Waldorf methodologies is remarkable on several levels. First, it demonstrates their relentlessness in reach-ing across geographical and cultural boundariesto find solutions to the challenges they encoun-tered as parents of special needs children. Second, it speaks to the deep resonance of the Steiner phi-losophy. Finally, it highlights the need for interna- tional contribution to local concerns in ruralRussia (despite legislation that has severely limit- ed the activity of foreign NGOs within the RussianFederation). Were it not for the efforts of the Friends of Waldorf Education that brought Waldorf-based school communities to Irkutsk, theChrysalis School might never have come intobeing. After my first visit to the school--a brief two days with a delegation of three Waldorf educators from Switzerland and Britain--I found myself on a train, rushing through the Siberian dusk back toward the city of Irkutsk. After a moment ofsilence reflecting on our visit, my travel compan- Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2[T]he domestic non- profit sphere in Russiahas only just begun todevelop, even in majorcities, and S.

Will they be able to build a more permanent community?\" On the one hand, it seemed impossible that a group of women with such limited resources could build, with little guidance, a self-sustaining Steiner- based community. But, had we visited ten years earlier, we would have viewed it far beyond theirreach to build a functioning school on nothingmore than their own sweat, hope, and volition. During my subsequent stay in the village, for three weeks in May of 2005, the mothers whowork in the school gave me their own answer tomy question. Nothing in Petrushka is easy; there will always be more work than hours in the day.But there is nothing to do but keep on working.There is nothing else worth fighting for. I am, in turn, overwhelmed by the scope of work thatremains to be done, and enormously inspired bytheir story. Where the Soviet Union failed, these women stand together, moving forward, armedwith a powerful guiding philosophy and an ironwill.EEnnddnnootteess 1.

This diagnosis is often translated into English as \"cerebral palsy,\" but the reality of diagnosis in the Soviet medical system is actually limited by an insufficient range of terminology, and \"DTsP\" refers to a broad range of diagnoses that includes cerebral palsy.

Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2\"It is faster to walk than it is to take the train.\" - Henry David Thoreau \"It is faster to hitchhike to Stockholm than it is to take the bus.\" - Amanda and Anatoli number of years ago I began to take a serious look at global environmental issues. The largest and most pressing of these issues is clearly the question of global warming or climate change.I became convinced that this issue is not driven bya correct understanding of the scientific issues but is, instead, driven by an incorrect view of the roleof carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. One of the key elements of this analysis was the discovery that warming created in large cities alone may be sufficient to account for all of the warmingobserved in the historical temperature data for any particular city. 1This analysis results in the conclusion that we may not have a global warm-ing issue, but, instead, a local and regional issuethat is independent of the type of fuel used. While presenting a two-week course on envi- ronmental issues to a group of young adults in J\u00e4rna, Sweden, recently, I thought about how each human being affects the earth as a whole. Ibecame curious about how much land is available to each human being, assuming that each humanon the earth has an equal area of land. The result surprised me. Presently, there are approximately 7 billion people on this planet. Knowing that popu- lation is still growing, I decided to use a popula- tion of 8 billion to plan a bit for the future. Takingthe diameter of the earth as 7,915 miles, I quicklycalculated the surface area of the earth. When wetake the surface area of the earth, remove the One Hundred Meters Squared MMiicchhaaeell DD''AAlleeoo 71% covered by water and reduce that land by 50% to account for frozen land masses and deserts, the resulting area of land available toeach human being is approximately an area 109yards by 109 yards or approximately 100 meterssquare. 2That's it\u2014the length of a football field by the length of a football field per human being. Everything that you need or value in the world has to be supported by human beings' abili-ties to work harmoniously with a piece of theearth roughly that size. Your food, water, clothing, shelter, transportation, energy, entertainment... you get the picture. Technically, you also have a piece of desert or chunk of ice the same size, as well as a piece of the ocean about four times this size, but, in essence, your life is supported by, atmost, a couple of hundred meters squared. Surely,such a fact implies the possibility of a new means of looking at environmental and social issues. Our present industrial lifestyle is only possible through the glaring imbalances of land use thataffluent (even modestly affluent) people of thewestern hemisphere\u2014roughly speaking\u2014havewith respect to the average person in the world. We know that the world is simply not largeenough for each person to live as an affluent Westerner, each with his or her own gasoline- powered vehicle and a current American commute. Unless we intend to begin the process of deciding who is on and who is off\u2014a \"real reali- ty\" version of Survivor\u2014or unless we accept the dire consequences of our unconscious continua-tion of the way things are, a new look at environ- mental issues is required. For a number of years I have been interested in the artwork of traditional cultures. This interest includes the cultures of Tibet, Kham, Mongolia,the Pacific Northwest, the Inuit, the traditionalWork of Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2culture of the mountains of Austria, and, recently, the Sami people of Sweden. When looking at their artwork, I am immediately struck by how little work there is and also the similarities\u2014and differ- ences\u2014among cultures in style and intention. Each piece generally has a function in daily life (itis not \"art for art's sake\") and has been madebeautiful because it is, in fact, one of its user'sonly possessions. A short list of such items mayinclude a knife, a needle case, a pouch for flint and steel, a bowl or spoon, clothing, boots, and ahat. Except for our clothing, the closest we cometo such items in the West are a cell phone, keys, and a credit card. Traditional people are frequently nomadic. Most of what they need is on their bodies at all times. As nomadic people, they move easily; when one area of their land becomes overused, they move on and let the earth heal and return to a natural balance. These people know every aspectof the earth and its rhythms. Their life not onlydepends on natural rhythms; their life is one of these rhythms. If each human life depends on land roughly 100 meters by 100 meters, it is no longer possible for human beings simply to move from a place onthe earth that they have just worn out to another place. We would simply be moving into anotherhuman being's \"worn out\" place. We require anew level of consciousness and a new means ofworking harmoniously with the earth. It is possible for every human being to live on the earth supported by an area of land 100meters by 100 meters if every human being recog-nizes the necessity, takes the opportunity, andassumes the daily responsibility to develop a rela- tionship with a piece of the earth. Such a relation- ship will be as different for each piece of the earth as each human being is different from another. Such work requires great sensitivity in reading patterns and establishing relationships with theland, as practiced intuitively for centuries by tra-ditional people. This work also requires the great imagination, ingenuity, and creativity that havedeveloped in supporting our modern ways of life. To make such a relationship with the earth a reality, we must educate human beings who are keen observers of subtle patterns in their sur-roundings (think: phenomenological science meetsa native dowser or shaman). Here, the ability to62 \u00b7 Work of the Research Fellows see what the land needs in order to become more balanced is combined with the patterns and resources already present (think: biodynamic agriculture meets the eye of the hunter). Here,every human creation is functional, beautiful, and integrated into the harmony of the local environment (think: practical and fine arts meet traditional indigenous crafts). Here, everyone willhave a relationship with a neighbor so that understanding another human being and her taskwill become as important as understanding our relationship with the earth (think: the best of Western culture meets the wisdom of generationshanded down by indigenous elders). The opportunity is here, now. What will you do with the 100 meters by 100 meters for which you are responsible? 3The world awaits your answer. EEnnddnnootteess 1.

Deepest thanks to Amanda and Anatoli, students whom Iwas teaching recently in Sweden who took me to Stockholm one Saturday afternoon to see the art of theSami. We didn't take the train, 62Work of the Research Fellows \u00b7 63 Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2would like to give you a sketch of an idea that is both simple and complicated, one that is both new and obvious. The idea came to me throughmy encounters in Africa over the past fourteenyears, but also through my experiences withWaldorf schools in Germany, Brazil, Russia, andother countries. I have seen wonderful Waldorfschools\u2014big schools with 12 or even 13 classes, with almost 1000 pupils, beautiful buildings, anda staff of 70 to 80 teachers. I have been teachingfor 36 years in one of these schools\u2014my ownbeloved school in Kassel, Germany. But I have also visited tiny Waldorf schools with up to, perhaps, 6classes\u2014in simple huts, with a few teachers who are provided with salaries enough for a sparrow's living. And I have seen many places without anyWaldorf school at all. Observing the quality of change in our mod- ern life, I will now express my deepest concernbriefly\u2014that is, the increasing worldwide mal- treatment, not to say abuse, of the children of our time by systems of state schooling. There is no time to lose. But our forces are limited. In South Africa we cannot afford to develop large numbersof such schools as Michael Mount [a larger South African Waldorf school], given the worldwide shortage of Waldorf-trained teachers, the lack of money, and the absence of support from theauthorities. So let us build a picture of a school reduced to the smallest possible size, a mini-Waldorf school,or, as I call it, a \"basic school\" of four school years combined with a kindergarten of three years. So we have a picture of a school of seven years forchildren from ages four to ten. What happens with the children, when they turn ten? We have learned from Rudolf Steiner that the children cross a \"Rubicon,\" which meansthat at this stage of life they have achieved the foundations for a secure and stable immune sys- tem. They have developed their own particular organism of health. The children have gainedwhat we call resilience\u2014in other words, a coat of armor to protect themselves from threats and temptations to come. When, now, children have toleave a Waldorf school environment, along with the wonderful education they have received from their teachers, they will be armored against what-ever happens to them in any other school they attend. So, let us look at these three years of pre- school and kindergarten, together with four years of school, as a full and complete pedagogical sup- port for the children, not merely as a fragment of what has to be completed over a period of seven, eight, or even twelve years. Look at what children do during the first three years of school. The curriculum contains the most wonderful topics, with the journey of learn-ing to write, to read, to calculate, all thoroughly worked through according to Waldorf methods.Children are allowed to work with joy, slowly,quietly, peacefully, and free from competition andstress. Each child has the opportunity to beimbued with the whole spiritual quality ofWaldorf education. But who can do this? My answer is simple: mothers who have matured through the realities of life, especially those who have not been aca-demically trained. Such women with commonsense will be able to teach to write, to read, to cal- culate, to knit and stitch, to draw, to sing, todance, to exercise in rhythm, to play, to garden, to do housework, and to tell stories. All these, allthe curriculum contents of the first four years,contain a basic education for each human being.Basic Schools and the Future of Waldorf Education PPeetteerr GGuutttteennhh\u00f6\u00f6ffeerr IClosing address of the 2008 National Teachers' Conference of the Federation of Waldorf Schools in South Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2[an African shaman] and artist, whom I recently met. It is not my intention to persuade you sud- denly to found a number of basic schools. I know that all of you are overloaded with the commit-ments you have to fulfill. But if there is a group ofpeople with initiative to start a school, I would like to encourage them with the idea of a basic school, to make it small, because \"small is beauti-ful,\" as the saying goes. In the meanwhile, the development of fully extended Waldorf schools from grades one to twelve must go on withoutbeing affected by the idea that \"small is beauti-ful.\" Better to call my proposal a basic school, working with elements of Waldorf education,rather than to call it a Waldorf school. My pro- posal addresses the question of concentrating ourlimited forces and limited financial means to theutmost and asks us to focus on the necessary task of our times. -------------------- PPeetteerr GGuutttteennhh\u00f6\u00f6ffeerr,,who has a PhD in history, includ- ing the history of literature and the history of art, has been a teacher at the Freie Waldorfschule Kassel, Germany, since 1972. For the past 26 years he has also been engaged in teacher training at the Seminar f\u00fcr Waldorfp\u00e4dagogik, Kassel. He is Bund derFreien Waldorfschulen. Since 1980, Dr. Guttenh\u00f6fer has educated teachers and advised schools in manycountries around the world.With a certain amount of training comple- menting the common sense and sound education- al experience of these women, who may well haveraised children of her own, such a teacher will then have the abilities to work with a group of children. How many African women have said that anthroposophy has brought them back to theirown roots; that anthroposophical knowledge can link directly to the traditional wisdom of Africa? I believe that only Waldorf education, springingfrom anthroposophy, can really respond to theneeds of African children\u2014and to the social chaos of South African society. When looking at our picture of a basic school we have to ask ourselves: Will parents have trustin a school where their children will reach only fourth grade? Only life can answer such a ques-tion. We have yet to appeal to those parents whowould appreciate an offering of four wonderful years of school as a complete educational pro-gram in its own right. We usually promise to goup to at least eighth grade, and often further. Ofcourse we would have to fulfill our professionalresponsibilities in using the fourth year as an adaptation year to prepare the children for any school of their choice\u2014if there is such a school at all. This picture can easily be modified. Imagine a school with five school years. Why not? This doesnot change the basic idea. What we can see and agree on are the untold numbers of children waiting for Waldorf educa- tion. A huge amount of educational competencelies hidden below the surface of life, often unused. \"Everything that the government schools bring isdead!\" said Credo Mutwa, the famous sangoma64\u00b7 Work \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2aul Dirac, the twentieth-century mathematician known for his acerbic brevity, is said to have sent the following cable to his colleagues following the birth of his first daughter: \"1 + 1 = 3.\" In the context of conventional mathematics, this equation is incorrect; from the perspective ofmarried life, however, it may constitute a true statement, assuming that Dirac and his wife did indeed bring a new member into their family. It all hinges on what you allow by the term \"plus:\"Does it mean simply the combination of previously existing entities, or can it also represent the transformational unionof two entities into some- thing greater than either one of them? This was the kind of question that hung in the air of two conferences I attended during Easter Week earlier this year. Though separated by six thousand miles and nine time zones, thesetwo gatherings both adumbrated the same nag-ging question: When it comes to researching the nature of the human being, what are we willing to accept as evidence\u2014along with all of theassumptions that make that evidence meaning-ful\u2014and what are we unwilling to accept? Putdifferently, when, if at all, is the human being simply an additive collection of traits, and when,if at all, is it a being capable of transforming itself into something greater than itself? The first gathering, held on the eve of the annual conference of the American Educational Research Association (AERA) in San Diego,California, brought together a small but broadspectrum of researchers and educators fromNorth American universities and Waldorf insti- tutes; the second, held a few days later at theGoetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland, includedinvited empirical researchers and Waldorf educa-tors from the fields of biology, pedagogy, andcurative education. There can be no progress on this question of legitimate evidence without at least a measure ofagreement on what constitutes a human being.Take, for instance, the question of stages of human development. At the San Diego gathering,participants representing Waldorf education camewith the assumption that the human being under- goes predictable stages of development for whichdifferent approaches to education are appropri-ate, indeed necessary. This assumption was not shared by participants from other educational streams, for whom questions of developmentallyappropriate modes of teaching did not figure intheir research nor in their suggestions for educa- tional reform. And while they respected the ideaof developmental stages in planning curricula, they did not seem interested in exploring it fortheir own proposed reforms. The conversationswere stimulating, personable, and genial, and yetI had the sense we were talking past, rather than with, one another. To put it concretely: If rockmusic is perceived to be developmentally inappro- priate at a certain age, for example, we will notinclude it in the curriculum. If stages of develop-ment are not recognized, however, there is no rea- son to exclude catchy rock tunes from the class- room, especially if they help to capture the atten-tion of restless youngsters. Bracket the existence of developmental stages, as understood by Waldorf educators, and the exclusion of rockmusic from the classroom may be perceived as quaintly old fashioned, even overly protective. SSkkeewweedd JJuussttiiffiiccaattiioonnss A similar, though more nuanced, feeling of skewed discourse pervaded the gathering of some 150 participants at the Goetheanum, who were jointly invited by Michaela Gl\u00f6ckler, leader of the Medical Section of the Anthroposophical Society,and Christof Wiechert, leader of its PedagogicalSection. Their stated intention was to provide a forum in which researchers from a multitude ofbackgrounds could converse and seek common ground. When One Plus One Equals Three: Evidence, Logic, and Professional Discourse DDoouuggllaass GGeerrwwiinnWork of the Research Fellows Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2As a representative of Waldorf education, it was a wake-up call to hear that modern empirical science can quite legitimately be seen to support the practices of Waldorf education, on the onehand, while at the same time to be told that this evidence should in no way be used as the basis formaking pedagogical decisions about appropriatecurriculum for any one age group. This caution deserves to be heard among Waldorf school circles in which statistical resultsof experiments conducted in mainstream scienceare used to justify certain practices\u2014or their absence\u2014in Waldorf school classrooms. Heiner Ullrich, Professor of Education at the Johannes-Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, who devoted his doctoral dissertation to Waldorf edu-cation, argued forcefully that pedagogical princi- ples are built upon what oughtto be among chil- dren, not only on what is their situation in the present case. He pointed out that teachers need to shape their lessons not only according to howtheir children are but according to how they shoulddevelop. If they appear too ruddy in their cheeks, for instance, we may balance their dispo- sition with exercises in memory; if they grow too pale, we introduce exercises that stimulate imagi- nation. These exercises are introduced because we feel the children should be helped to achieve a condition of healthy balance. The results of empirical research into the development of children, however, are intended toindicate solely what is--or may be--the case in one or another set of circumstances. These empiri-cal results are never intended to tell teachers what to do. \"A statement of what is can never be used to derive a statement of what ought to be,\"Ullrich concluded. \"Logically, an ought statement can never give rise to an isstatement.\" In practical terms, this serves as warning against using the results of contemporary science, such as brain research, to justify the practices of Waldorf education. While it may be useful, even reassuring, to know that the results of main- stream empirical research are consistent with the practices of Waldorf education, it is a logical falla-cy--and even a disservice to this empirical research--to wrench it into the witness stand and use it as testimony in favor of Waldorf education- al practices. Contemporary research may serve toconfirm, or challenge, what we do, but it cannot be appropriated in order to instruct us what to do. For pedagogical reform we need to exercise peda- gogical insight, rather than rely upon empirical results. Ullrich was one of several university profes- sors at the Dornach conference who, based in their empirical research, offered fresh insights intothe nature of childhood. But they vigorously resis-ted the suggestion, advanced by Christof Wiechert, that they might be illustrating certain archetypal principles that underlie the unfolding of the human being. For Ullrich, childhood is \"anhistorical phenomenon, not a universal reality.\" Inhis view, children are children by dint of what wemake of them in a cultural and historical context,and not spiritual entities going through archetyp- al stages of development. Professor Hans Georg Schlack, chief physician at the Children's Neurological Center in Bonn, Germany, and a specialist in neuro-pediatrics, took a similar view in his summary of empiricalresearch concerning the ability of young childrenfirst to recognize their reflection, second to refer to themselves by their own name, and, finally, toname themselves using the first person pronoun. He related that researchers studied the first stepby painting a red dot on the forehead of an infantand then holding it in front of a mirror. To beginwith, the toddlers would attempt to touch the reddot by reaching for the mirror surface; eventuallythey would touch the dot by tapping their ownforehead. Schlack pointed out that most childrenmade this switch over roughly a one-year period- -between the ages of 12 and 26 months. By con- trast, most children began to refer to themselves by their own name over a much longer period of2.3 years\u2014between the ages of 14 and 42 months. And the final achievement, of referring to oneself as \"I,\" took most children an ever longerspan of 2.5 years--between the ages of 24 and 54 months. His point was to stress the wide range of vari- ability in the timing of these stages, and he cate- gorically rejected the notion of any narrowlydefined \"normal\" or archetypal timetable. He was unwilling to be drawn into speculation as to whythe first period was so much shorter than the sec-ond and third periods. 66 \u00b7 Work of the Research of the Research Fellows \u00b767 Research Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2From an anthroposophical perspective of the human being, however, it was striking to notice that the more that a change was tied to the physi- cal body (i.e., learning to touch a red dot on one'sforehead), the shorter the time frame of develop-ment, and, conversely, the more a change was independent of the physical body (i.e., referring to oneself as \"I\"), the longer the span of develop- ment. EEvviiddeennccee aanndd LLooggiicc Perhaps the most striking example of the dif- ference between mainstream and anthroposophi- cal research was offered by Wolfgang Schad, a Waldorf school graduate and high school teacherwho also taught biology of evolution and mor-phology at the University of Witten/Herdecke, Germany. He painted a remarkable picture of thehuman placenta as a physiological representation of the higher self that accompanies the human being as it takes hold of a physical body. 1He described how the placenta initially performs all of the physiological functions on behalf of thegrowing embryo, and only gradually relinquishesthese functions as the fetus becomes capable of taking them on itself. Basic functions, such as res- piration, circulation, digestion, and excretion, are slowly handed over to the fetus as it develops.One can say that the placenta \"dies away\" as the embryo emerges, so that the birth of the embryo at nine months coincides with the death of the placenta. \"In short,\" Schad concluded, \"one canthink of the placenta as the best kind of Waldorf teacher, one who gradually steps back while hand- ing over the functions of existence to the child asit is able to take them on, until the child is launched in full freedom, no longer bound by any umbilical attachment to the organism that gave it help for as long as it needed it.\" How are we to interpret the evidence of human development if we cannot come to a shared picture of what a human being is, includ- ing its higher nature? A view of the human beingthat excludes any spiritually guided stages ofunfolding will make no sense of Schad's researchbeyond its basic empirical data. In an essay published some years ago, 2Schad offers three levels of interpretation when it comes to studying the full human being, using three dis-tinct modes of thinking or sets of logical assump-tions. At the most physical level, he says, we canunderstand the human body in terms of the laws of the physical world, which we also know as laws of causality. Here events of the past give rise to\u2014and often fully explain\u2014events of the pres-ent. Thus, given two billiard balls, A and B, onecan fully explain, even predict, the motion of bil-liard ball B once it is hit by billiard ball A; in this instance, the present is explained by the past. Cause explains effect. Once we rise to the level of the living physical body\u2014that is, a physical entity given life by an etheric organism\u2014the rules change. However we try, we will be hard-pressed to explain presentbehavior fully in terms of past events. Here Schad introduces a new way of thinking, which he calls \"biological thinking,\" in which we let go of themodel of the past determining the present and speak only in terms of one present event coincid-ing with another present event, without making any claim as to one being the cause of the other.We thereby escape the conundrum that causal thinking poses of the living realm: Which comes first, for example, the chicken or egg? Instead, werestrict ourselves to observing the close relation- ship between chickens and eggs. In causal think- ing, we can say, \"If this, then that\"; in biological thinking, we say \"When this, then that.\" Finally, we rise to the level of the sentient liv- ing physical body--that is, a living physical organism inhabited, at least for as long as we areawake, by a conscious soul or astral body--andSchad describes how the rules of explanation change once again. At this level we make moresense of present events by attending to the soul's desires or wishes; in other words, we make senseof present events not by appeal to some abstractcause in the past, but, rather, by attending to the nature of some as yet unrealized future. At this level, paradoxical though it may sound, the pres- ent is shaped more by the future than by the past. Schad describes this approach to understandingthe human being at the soul level as \"teleologicalthinking,\" in which explanation is couched not interms of a past cause but of a future goal (Greek:telos). At the level of the soul, we understand the human being more fully by seeing how the futuregives shape to the present. In this way, Schad points to three distinct lev- els of understanding when it comes to the study of human nature. Evidence couched in terms of causality may adequately account for events atBulletin 67the level of the physical body but prove to be inca- pable of making sense of the human being in its living and conscious aspects. For these levels weneed other forms of evidence, and other ways ofthinking about this evidence. 3 Herein lies a two-fold task. The first is to determine which kind of evidence we are consider-ing and with which type of thinking it is best understood. When does 1 + 1 = 2, and when not?The second is to articulate as clearly as possiblethe logic\u2014causal, coincident, or teleological\u2014bywhich we are assessing this evidence so that we can more successfully reach out to other researchers at the level at which they are conduct- ing their work.

How parents view their schools and the teachers and administrators who inhabit them is a perennial subject in meet- ings, hallways, and private discussions. While weall may have direct experiences and anecdotal data about the perceptions, concerns, and hopesof the adult communities in our Waldorf schools, we lack reliable data. Until we have a better basis for understanding, we can expect to bounce fromone issue to another with little hope for improve-ment. With the guidance and assistance of the Research Institute, I am conducting a new study on perceptions of parents and their role in Waldorf schools. This article provides a report of the process and describes the background,method, and some of the challenges this research has entailed. In early 2006 it became apparent that there was an opportunity to use the annual multi-school workshops that I had been presenting under my own organizational banner, that of theAlexis de Tocqueville Institute, to conductresearch. Over the previous five years I had experi- mented with ways to improve adult learning through these workshops. I had introduced a questionnaire, as a teaching tool, at the beginningof each workshop. It functioned as a means of set- ting the tone and providing an overview of ques- tions helpful to engaging with the workshop topic.The workshop series I was preparing for the2006-2007 school year was called, \"The Role ofthe Parent: Joining Forces with Your School.\" When I realized that such a questionnaire also offered the potential to collect valuable data, Icontacted the Research Institute, and we agreed to work closely on the design and distribution of arevised questionnaire. We recognized that herewas an opportunity to gather useful data and, perhaps, to publish an article of value to Waldorf schools. Since the start of this research project I have discontinued professional work under the Alexis de Tocqueville Institute banner and am nowconducting my workshops and consulting as amember of Skystone Ryan, an international con- sulting firm. The revised questionnaire became part of four multi-school workshops in different regions of the U.S. between October 2006 and January 2008.Parents, faculty, staff, and trustees from severaldifferent schools attended each workshop.Workshop participants were told that their anony-mous responses to the questionnaire would be col-lected at the end of the workshop for possibleinclusion in a national research project. While these four workshops provided a good cross section of a Waldorf school community,they did not provide a large enough sample size.To remedy this, I contacted a number of schools toinvite their participation. Since distribution andcollection were conducted by intermediaries atthese schools, great care was taken in communi- cating with the contact person at each school. I asked each school to seek a range of participants, not just parents. I attached a cover letter explain- ing the purpose of the questionnaire and my com- mitment to keeping all participants anonymous. Iwas successful in arranging for the distribution and collection of questionnaires from six schools. Ialso collected questionnaires at a regional confer-ence. The questionnaire was designed for paper and pen responses, with 32 multiple choice and narra-tive response questions. At the four workshopsand one conference, questionnaires were distrib-uted and collected manually. For the six schools, I distributed an original by email attachment andarranged for a contact at each school to print Progress Report on the Waldorf Parent Survey MMaarrttiinn NNoovvoomm Reports from Current Projects of Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2News from the Online Waldorf Library MMaarriiaannnnee AAllssoopphard copies for distribution and collection. The completed questionnaires were mailed back from the six schools. I collected a total of 313 complet- ed questionnaires. The purpose of this research is to collect use- ful data from parents, teachers, administrators, and active volunteers\u2014trustees and committee70 \u00b7 Reports from Current Projects of the Research Institute members\u2014regarding their perceptions of the role and perspectives of parents in Waldorf schools.As of this writing, the data has been compiled and is being analyzed. We anticipate the publica-tion of conclusions from the analysis in a forth-coming issue of the Research Bulletin. The Online Waldorf Library (OWL) continues to see an increasing number of inquiries and requests for information. Over the past eight months traffic has increased by 15% over the same period last year. Daily requests for general information are directed to other web-based resources like AWSNA, WECAN, and the International Association for Steiner/Waldorf Early Childhood Education. Direct links to these and other groupsworking internationally with Waldorf educationare on the links page of the OWL site. A new addi- tion is the link to the World Language Teachers inWaldorf Schools website, a helpful web-basedcommunity of foreign language teachers and resources. The current economy has led to a number of requests for homeschooling resources from par- ents who have had to withdraw their children from independent Waldorf schools. Their requests are heartfelt, and it is obvious that, having made the decision to withdraw their child from school,they want to continue the education as well asthey can. The OWL site offers many specific cur-riculum resources as well as links to homeschool-ing resource sites. Included in the many requests for information over the past months are these topics: Teaching resources for working with children with special needs, both in homeschool and public school settings. Understanding sleep, from physical and spiri- tual standpoints. Research on gender issues specific to curricu- lum. How to work with the Extra Lesson in a homeschool situation. The relationship of knitting to brain develop- ment. Teaching German in a homeschool setting. Teaching music in the middle grades. Research on the development of handwriting. The evolutionary sequence of consonants. Most notable this year has been the increased use of online or e-books, specifically the titles in the \"Foundations of Waldorf Education\" series. Other frequently used online resources include the Science Newsletters; Guenther Hauk's Handwork and Handicrafts; and back issues of Gateways. The Online Waldorf Library invites your ques- tions and comments, and encourages readers of the Research Bulletin to explore this valuable virtual library.

Research Bulletin \u00b7 Bulletin \u00b7 Autumn 2009 \u00b7 Volume 14 \u00b7 #2 he Research Institute for Waldorf Education is an initiative working on behalf of the Waldorf school movement. It receives support and guidance from the Pedagogical Section of the School of Spiritual Science and financial support through the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA), the Midwest Shared Gifting Group, theWaldorf Schools Fund, the Waldorf Curriculum Fund, and private donors through the Rudolf SteinerFoundation. The Research Institute was founded in 1996 in order to deepen and enhance the quality of Waldorf education, to engage in serious and sustained dia- logue with the wider educational-cultural communi-ty, and to support research that would serve educa- tors in all types of schools in their work with chil- dren and adolescents. The Research Institute has responded to the call for research as a top priority of the Waldorf school movement by becoming a supporting organizationof AWSNA and by co-sponsoring research projectswith the Association and with the Pedagogical Section. We support research projects that deal with essential contemporary educational issues such asthe role of play in early childhood, attention-related disorders, trends in adolescent development andinnovations in the high school curriculum, survey of Waldorf graduates, learning expectations and assessment, computers in education, the role of art in education, and new ways to identify and address different learning styles. The Research Institute hassponsored colloquia and conferences that have brought together educators, psychologists, doctors, and social scientists. We have published a Research Bulletintwice a year for the last decade, and we are developing and distributing educational resources tohelp teachers in all aspects of their work. We sponsor the Online Waldorf Library: www.waldorflibrary.org, whose mission is to make available contemporary writings on Waldorfeducation, and we host our own site: www.waldorfresearchinstitute.org, where up-to-date research is posted. The Research Institute is a 501(c) (3) tax-exempt organization and gratefully accepts donations.
