Please Upload Your COVID-19 Vaccination Information Dear Colleagues: Please help ensure a safe and healthy campus for yourself and others across BU by uploading your COVID-19 vaccination documentation today. We ask that you upload your documentation to help the University determine the level of vaccination participation by the BU community as we plan for the fall. Note that being vaccinated has not been mandated by the University. Also note that the upload is confidential personal health information and will not be shared with managers or supervisors. To those faculty and staff that have already provided your vaccination documentation, thank you. If you haven't already done so, please take a couple of minutes to follow these steps: How to Upload Vaccination Documentation: - Log into the [Healthway/Occupational Health Connect Portal](https://www.bu.edu/healthway/)using your BU username and Kerberos password. - Select \"Upload COVID & Vaccine Docs\" from the left sidebar menu. - Indicate the type of document you are uploading by choosing \"COVID-19 Vaccination Document\" from the dropdown menu. - Choose your file and upload a photo of your CDC vaccination card (PNG, PDF, or JPG files only). - To complete your document upload, select the green \"SUBMIT\" button. - If you received the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine, do not upload vaccination information until you receive the second shot. - If you have already uploaded or emailed documentation, or you were vaccinated at the Charles River Vaccination Clinic, you do not need to upload documentation again. All uploaded information will be confidential, and will not be shared. - The documentation should not include any additional personal medical, mental health, or genetic information or history. - After you select SUBMIT: - You will see a brief Thank You message. You will be brought back to the home screen. - You will receive an email from [ohcinfo@bu.edu](mailto:ohcinfo@bu.edu)within 5 minutes of submission to confirm your upload is complete. - An additional email will arrive when your document has been reviewed and accepted by clinical staff. - If you need to upload multiple documents (e.g., test results and a provider note), complete one submission process for each document. - You can find further information on the IS&T help site. Questions or need assistance? Please contact BU COVID 19 Employee Support at [covidhelp@bu.edu](mailto:covidhelp@bu.edu). Thank you! Sincerely, Kenneth W.
