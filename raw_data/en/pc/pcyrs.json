Celestial Cycles As we move through our lives, we are subtly influenced by celestial cycles and seasons. Every day, we observe the rhythm of the sun rising in the morning and setting at night. Its orbit creates internal patterns that flow within us while the change in seasons tells its own story to our souls. Each of the four seasons offers unique energetic qualities and influences. Tailored to express each season and its cycle, this menu of services offers comfort and guidance on your journey through the four seasons. Each treatment draws on the color, element, and unique qualities of its cycle to provide a connection between yourself and the natural flow of the world around you.
