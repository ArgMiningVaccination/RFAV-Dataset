For new families and growing families alike, our Naturopathic Doctors offer education and guidance to optimize your overall health and prepare you for a healthy conception, pregnancy, birth and life with baby. The preconception period is the best time to assess the overall health of both partners and to address any underlying health concerns. Our doctors will review your health history in detail and determine the need for any exams or bloodwork while providing recommendations to encourage healthy conception and pregnancy. Pregnancy is a unique experience for every woman and our doctors provide adjunctive care for you in addition to your OB or midwife. While we do not treat pregnancy itself, we can address a variety of health conditions that may arise during these nine months to help you feel your best. Following the birth of your little one, our doctors will continue to support your health and the health of your family. We are here to help you with recommendations on healing after birth, infant feeding practices, emotional wellbeing, contraception or parenting advice.
