Methods: 80 cases of diabetics who were treated at XX hospital from January of 2014 to January of 2015 were chosen as research subjects, according to random indicator method divided into control group and experimental group with 40 cases in each group. The patients in the control group were treated with metformin hydrochloride alone, and the patients in the experimental group received Chinese medicine combined with metformin hydrochloride. To compare the TCM syndrome points, Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG) and 2 h postprandial blood glucose (2 h PG), Fasting Insulin (FINS) and 2 h postprandial insulin (2 h INS) levels of two groups of patients before and after the implementation of treatment, at the same time observing he levels of TNF-, MCP-1 and NO before and after treatment. Results: After treatment, the TCM syndromes in the experimental group were significantly better than those in the control group (P<0.05), and FBG, 2 h PG, FINS, 2 h INS were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05), as same as the levels of TNF-, MCP-1 and NO. Conclusion: Chinese Medicine combined with metformin hydrochloride tablets can effectively treat diabetes and reduce the concentration of TNF-, MCP-1 and NO in the blood.Author(s): Wei Li, Mingmin Wang, Wei Wu, Yunyun Bai, Qingxi Wang "}
