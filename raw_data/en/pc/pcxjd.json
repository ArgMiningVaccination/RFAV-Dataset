Where to begin? Start here looking through our FAQ. integrative holistic medicine FAQ How is Center for Living Health different from other medical practices? We are committed to supporting parents who seek integrative/holistic health care but who also want the assurance of a board certified MD. Visits with Dr. Allen are unhurried, allowing him to really listen to you, and answer ALL your questions. He treats the whole person, addressing not only symptoms but their root cause, by understanding and evaluating the physical, emotional, social, environmental, and spiritual aspects of health and illness. We believe in educating and empowering parents with treatment options that will support the healing of the whole child, while nourishing and strengthening each child's inherent healing ability. Our patients like the fact that Dr. Allen is triple board certified in Pediatrics, Integrative/Holistic medicine and Anthroposophic Medicine. He offers support and nourishment to the child and family in a more natural way, but he is also trained to recognize when the body gets overwhelmed and requires a more conventional approach. This integrative approach provides your family the best of both complementary and conventional medicine. Even our office is designed to offer a soothing tranquil environment. Read more why parents and kids alike love coming to our office. Can Dr. Allen be my primary care physician? While many of our patients come to Dr. Allen as their main family physician, we recommend that our families maintain a physician who is in their insurance network as their primary care physician (PCP) as a back-up for hospitalizations, emergency care, and after hours call. Dr. Allen is available for consultations, preventive/well care visits and same-day acute sick visits during routine office hours. Does your office do labs or immunizations in your office? Because we are a small practice, we are unable to offer any type of vaccines, injections or lab work of any kind in our office. We can provide you with a lab slip to take to the lab contracted with your insurance, and the lab will fax us the results. If you have HMO insurance, you can have the labs we recommend, done through your primary care physician and request the lab fax us a copy of the results as well. However, Dr. Allen does offer in depth vaccine consultations to help parents better understand vaccines and develop a customized vaccine schedule. He respects families beliefs and choices regarding vaccines, and is here to help you formulate the best approach for your family based on relevant needs. Where can I find your fee schedule for appointments? Fees and types of appointments are listed on our website here. Do you accept insurance? No. We are a fee for service practice which means we do not take insurance. Most insurers classify Dr. Allen as an \"out of network\" provider. This allows him to spend the time needed with his patients to offer the high level of care needed, without interference from insurers. We will provide you with an insurance superbill to submit to your insurance company for reimbursement, depending on your plan. After working in a conventional practice with insurance for 12 years, Dr Allen did not like insurance companies telling him how he could practice medicine, or what limited treatment options he could provide for his patients. Being part of an insurance network often means that priority is placed on high patient volume with office visits often scheduled for only 5-10 minutes. Consultations with Dr. Allen can last one-two hours long. By being fee for service, we have the flexibility to offer families personalized treatment plans that integrate the best of conventional and holistic medicine. Fortunately today, there are many high deductible PPO insurance plans that can incorporate health savings accounts, so families can actually save money on monthly insurance premiums, and then use that savings to pay for the kind of care they truly want their families to receive.

Holistic Integrative Medicine is in essence a health approach that looks at the whole person - body, mind, and spirit. It begins with the foundation of modern conventional medicine and extends much beyond that in the realm of nutrition, social, emotional and spiritual aspects of health. Holistic medicine respects and supports the body's natural ability to heal and be well, seeing each of us as an unique individual, and recognizing each persons inherent healing ability. It involves understanding that when we are in balance, we are healthy, and when we are out of balance, illnesses arise. Therefore, an extensive and specialized history and physical exam are utilized, with the knowledge of human physical, emotional and spiritual development, to uncover areas of imbalance. Then individualized treatment plans are created to help nourish and support the child and family on their strategic path back to achieving balance once again. Holistic and Anthroposophic medicine call for a time commitment on part of the family, and a willingness and dedication to grow and learn. There are few if any quick fixes or magic solutions. Some medications may make symptoms disappear quickly, but to actually alleviate an imbalance that leads to true healing takes time. The focus is on a team approach, working together to identify areas of imbalance and instituting treatment plans, with the goal of achieving a greater state of balance and health for the child and the whole family. What is Anthroposophical medicine? Anthroposophic Medicine (AM) is a form of holistic medicine. It uses modern western medicine asits foundation, along with an extending complementary medicine, which offers apathway for meeting the whole human being. AM provides tools that allow us to understand more about the roots of both health and illness. The insights are both novel and diverse about the interaction between body, soul, and spirit; about the human being's relationship to the natural world; about new therapeutic possibilities for fostering health and healing; and about the experience of illness as part of a continuous path of individual development. These aspects are often unrecognized or even ignored in conventional medical school, but they add depth and meaning to the art of practicing medicine. AM uses specialized homeopathic and plant medicines, and specialty therapies in treatment that help patients to overcome illness while supporting inner development, making us stronger and more capable people. It constitutes a holistic and human-centered approach to healing and understanding illness. Anthroposophy comes from the Greek words anthropomorphic (human) and sophia (wisdom). Anthroposophy means a road to knowledge of man. It does not see illness merely as an unfortunate accident or mechanical breakdown, but rather as intimately connected to the whole person, and potentially positive. If met and treated in an appropriate way, illness may bring a new balance and opportunities for growth in our lives. Dr. Allen is one of only two pediatricians in the United States to be certified in Anthroposophic medicine. Do you sell remedies and supplements?

Most people potentially can benefit from sessions. Because this work supports the brain and nervous system, it is effective in assisting the prevention of many chronic conditions, including stiffness, sleep problems, memory loss, inflammation, immune imbalances. It also addresses injuries, even those that occurred long ago, including perinatal/ birth trauma, that you may have no idea was still affecting you. Most people at some point have had head or tailbone injury from sports, falls, or car accidents. This work strengthens your whole body system on a multitude of levels. Due to its gentleness and effectiveness, many people include CST as a part of their personal wellness programs. They report having more energy, sleeping better and being sick less often. Does Linda work with both children and adults? Yes. Linda works with adults, teens, children and babies. She is known for her special connection with the children she works with, and many parents tell her that their children ask to come back and see her, as they innately feel the changes in themselves.. Gentle and non-invasive, craniosacral therapy is effective in ways children and adults can intuitively recognize. What should I expect during a craniosacral session with Linda? There is no predetermined treatment protocol, the work honors and listens to the body's innate healing wisdom. Most sessions usually last about 35-40 minutes. Sessions dealing with deeper emotional traumas are usually an hour. Patients relax on the table fully clothed, but without shoes. What you experience from your own session is highly individual. Clients may experience subtle sensations, like floating, deep relaxation or sometimes slight discomfort in different parts of the body as the trauma moves through. There are times when a deep, meditative state of consciousness is felt, when the mind gets out of the way to allow the system to reorganize in some profound way. If your system is tired, you'll relax and rest, which is deeply healing in itself. For deeper emotional work, along with gentle touch, Linda will also guide clients in dialoguing techniques. Although many may feel immediately better, the body can take up to a week to integrate the changes as forces from restrictions are released and the body and nervous system \"recircuits itself\" in more natural, balanced and health way. Bringing the body back into balance and thus resolving symptoms happens quickly in some cases and not so quickly in others. Some conditions are cumulative and don't necessarily resolve over night. The process for healing can be incremental, and the work is often subtle. Imagine the process of detoxification: If you have lots of \"toxins\" in your body (past emotional and physical traumas, etc.), it will take longer to clear them. Also, people with many \"toxins\" built up may experience effects similar to a physical detoxification as the body rids itself of these patterns, reorganizes, and repairs past traumas. These effects can last 24-72 hours, followed by amazing healing and relief of pre-therapy symptoms. During this time it is important to nurture oneself and acknowledge the symptoms so they will release, not refreeze in the body. Remember that this is a positive and desirable healing process for the whole person. How many sessions do I need? The number of sessions is extremely variable, and depends on what your goals are, what symptoms you suffer from, the complex layers of injury and trauma that may mask the original cause of problems, and how readily your system responds to this therapy. While a onetime session can be given for deep inner peace, a series of treatments is recommended to get the full benefit of the therapy and its cumulative effects on the whole body. As a general rule, three to ten sessions will have a significant impact on most people's health, and in some cases only one session can make a dramatic difference. Often, people receive regular sessions for longer periods of time, followed by an occasional tune-up to maintain health. What are fee's for sessions? Fees and types of appointments are listed on our website here. What is Craniosacral Therapy (CST) Every day you endure stresses and strains and your body absorbs them. But your body can only handle so much tension before the tissues begin to tighten and potentially affect the brain and spinal cord. Unfortunately, this can compromise the function of the central nervous system \u2014 and the performance of nearly every other system in your body. CranioSacral Therapy(CST) releases those tensions allowing the entire body to relax and self-correct. CST is a gentle method of detection and correction of restrictions and imbalances in the craniosacral system. The craniosacral system is a network of interrelated tissues and fluids at the core of the body; including the central nervous system, cerebrospinal fluid, dural tissues, and the bones of the cranium, spine and sacrum. The craniosacral system directly impacts the central nervous system, therefore an imbalance within the craniosacral system can cause any number of sensory, motor or neurological disabilities. Common causes of imbalances are physical injuries, emotional and psychological stresses, birth trauma and toxicity. CST strengthens your the immune system, calms the central nervous system, improves function of the brain, and releases tissue restrictions from physical and emotional trauma. CST is is very unique among treatment modalities because it can have a tremendous therapeutic effect on the brain and nervous system. Due to its gentleness and effectiveness, CST is excellent for adults,children and infants. What is the advanced brain & neurosystem therapy Linda practices? Building on craniosacral therapy, the advanced brain and neuro training Linda provides releases retained reflexes structural and energetic lesions. tension patterns and trauma that stress the body, Developed by Bruno Chikly, MD, this work addresses very specific neurological structures of the brain, spinal cord, and nervous system. The body often aligns itself around tissue microstructures in the brain and spinal cord, and they are frequently unaddressed key/primary tissue restrictions. Many of these restricted structures are repeatedly one of the most important components of somatic dysfunctions. For this reason, advanced brain therapy is helpful to most people, but specifically helpful for any brain and spinal cord related pathologies, including concussions, whiplash, headaches, dyslexia, cerebral palsy, cognitive behavioral dysfunctions, learning disabilities, sensory dysfunction, cross dominance, ADD/ADHD, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Linda has trained and mentored under Dr. Chikly extensively in this work. What is Emotional Healing & heart centered therapy (hct) ? A specialization of Linda's practice is working with emotional traumas of the soul and spirit to safely release old patterns in our tissue's that are blocking progress or causing physical pain. Research has shown that sometimes structural pain will not subside until the emotional components are cleared first. The feelings around illness have to be addressed before healing can begin. Linda skillfully guides you through soft touch and masterful dialoguing techniques that identify and transform the emotional component of disease and discomfort in the body, the related trauma, as well as the ancestral patterns that have sustained wounding within the immediate family and the family lineage. Inside this gentle and respectful process is a very direct, straightforward approach that pierces straight to the core of an issue. The story is set aside and the work is with the emotions imprinted in the body. The depth reached through the therapies Linda practices quickly and gently resolve even the deepest rooted traumas. Is Craniosacral Safe During Pregnancy? CST is safe and highly recommended during pregnancy, because it calms the nervous system of both mother and child. During pregnancy, a baby does not know the difference between mother's thoughts and feelings of its own, so when Mom's system is soothed and balanced during pregnancy, the baby gains huge benefits. A woman experiences dramatic changes in her body during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum recovery. Many pregnant women also find sessions with Linda help them feel more comfortable during pregnancy, addressing the concerns and discomforts arising from these changes, especially sciatic, nerve and back pain. Another important goal of a pregnancy session is to gently improve mobility in the mother's pelvis so her baby can more easily assume an ideal position for birth. This can promote a timely, easier birth for mom and baby. Postpartum treatments focus on realignment of the spine and pelvis and nurturing the mother's body back to harmony. Sessions help facilitate healing on all levels. What other modalities does linda blend in her sessions? Emotional Release Acupressure Linda is certified in and has advanced training in Jin Shin do (Compassionate Spirit) Acupressure for Emotional Balancing. Using traditional Chinese acupuncture points, this ancient technique uses finger pressure rather than needles to stimulate the flow of energy throughout the meridians and autonomic nervous system. Meridians are like rivers flowing through the body to irrigate and nourish the tissues. An obstruction in the movement of these energy rivers is like a dam that backs up, creating imbalance and pain. Long known for its ability to alleviate physical pain, the ancient healing art of acupressure also relieves stress and emotional pain. From day-to-day pressures to life's most significant trails, traumatic events cause the body to shut down and keep negative feelings \"stuck,\" resulting in physical ailments and emotional imbalances. Acupressure is effective in the relief of stress-related ailments, self-treatment and preventive health care. Acupressure releases tension, increases circulation, reduces pain, and develops vibrant health. Lymphatic Drainage Therapy (LDT) LDT uses gentle, wave like movements to activate lymph and interstitial fluid as well as stimulate functioning of the immune and parasympathetic nervous systems. The predominant fluid in your body is lymphatic fluid. It carries nutrients from the food you eat and oxygen from the air you breathe. It also carries toxic poisons, bacteria, cholesterol and viruses away from the cells in your body. Our lymphatic system is primarily responsible for carrying disease-fighting material to cells. When the lymphatic system is blocked, we become defenseless against attacks by virus, fungi, and bacteria. LDT has anti-aging effects, helps detoxify the body and regenerates tissue. John Barnes Myofascial Release (MRF) MRF uses gentle, sustained pressure into myofascial restrictions to eliminate pain, and restore structural alignment and motion. The myofascial system is the connective tissue web that ensheaths every bone, muscle, nerve, system, and organ in our body; it's our body's support system. Fascia is very strong, and can pull at up to two thousand pounds per square inch. If this fascia is restricted, it may pull on the bones of the skull or the sacrum and affect the CranioSacral System. When an injury occurs, the fascia can become twisted and rigid, pulling the structure out of alignment, restricting movement, entrapping nerves and contributing to pain and dysfunction. Energy Healing/Chakra Balancing Our physical bodies are surrounded by a human energy /electromagnet field. This energy \"body\" has been verified by scientists and blockages are the origins are much of our reality. Releasing vital energy can accelerate cellular release of past patterns and emotions, clearing the energetic field around and within the body. Energy healing clears, charges and balances the body's electric system, chakras and energy field. A light touch, gentle manipulation and holding are used in this technique. Pressure is not needed. The change is reflected and experienced in the physical , etheric and astral body. Have more questions? Feel free "}
