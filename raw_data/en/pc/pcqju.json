Testing allows people to take precautions, like isolating, in a timely manner to stop the virus from spreading; infected people without symptoms can still spread the virus. Testing also helps public health officials identify and respond to outbreaks, and to track new variants of the virus. When to Get Tested - Test when you feel sick. COVID-19 has a wide range of [symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html), so if you're not feeling well, it's best to get tested as soon as possible. - Test when you've been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Get tested immediately if you're showing symptoms. If you're not showing symptoms, follow the guidance in [What To Do if You Were Potentially Exposed to Someone With COVID-19 (PDF)](https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2022-02/COVIDexposed.pdf)for when to get tested. - Businesses and event spaces in Washington may have testing and/or vaccination requirements before entering an establishment or event.
