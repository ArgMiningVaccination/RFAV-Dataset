In the United States, herbal preparations fall under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration. They are viewed as food supplements. After the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act passed in 1994, the FDA allowed manufactures to list use and safety information on herbal product labels. No curative or preventative actions were to be listed. Unfortunately, these FDA regulations obscure the worldwide recognition of herbs as therapeutic agents and create a difficult environment in United States for herb use, quality control and research. | | For questions, please contact | | The University of Minnesota Duluth is an equal opportunity educator and employer.
