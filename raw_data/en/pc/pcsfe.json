We all have some of it. We want more of it. But we can't get it. The history of spiritual development is full of tough exercises to develop the \"will muscle.\" [Shaolin monks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaolin_Monastery) and [Himalayan yogis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kailash) brave icy waters and tropical heat with the same equanimity for a single reason: to strengthen their willpower. I've seen videos of spiritual masters doing really dangerous things (that I don't want to mention here lest some readers decide to try it on themselves) all in the name of developing willpower. They may work for the kings or queens of the Himalayas. But they just won't work for you or me. Us \"Urban Yogis\" A majority of the willpower bolstering techniques seem to be close to impossible for us \"urban yogis\" to follow. That's why I found the following original technique developed by the early-20th century theosophist [Rudolph Steiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Steiner) an interesting alternative that anyone can easily perform. Rudolf Steiner was an Austrian philosopher and spiritualist. He is known for his holistic approach to the world, which he called anthroposophy. Steiner believed that we should not think of our body as separate from our soul, but rather as a unified whole. And this is why he developed his own exercise practice, which he called the \"Control of Will exercise\". Control of Will The [Control of Will exercise](https://tomvangelder.antrovista.com/pdf/basic.pdf) is one of the six main exercises of spiritual development recommended by Steiner. The technique consists of the following: - Pick an arbitrary act, any act, to perform. - Pick a time of the day, any time, to perform that act. - Perform the act at the chosen time without fail, no matter what, every day. Obviously, the third part of this exercise is the hardest. But let's look at the first two requirements. "}
