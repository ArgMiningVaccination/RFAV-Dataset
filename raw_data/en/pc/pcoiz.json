Through this initiative the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in partnership with other NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices, requests applications for studies designed to develop and test multi-level interventions to prevent opioid misuse, opioid use disorder, and co-occurring conditions by intervening on social determinants of health (SDOH).This initiative aims to build an evidence base for multi-level interventions that target malleable factors and conditions affecting the social context. Applications must seek to reduce health inequities in a U.S. population or population subgroup affected by the opioid crisis by studying the effects of a theory driven, multi-level intervention on the prevention of opioid misuse/opioid use disorder and co-occurring conditions. Such conditions could include mental health conditions and/or suicide, and may also include other substance use and substance use-related outcomes. The research project must examine the mechanisms by which the interventions exert their effects, and conduct economic analyses to inform decisions about adoption of strategies. Investigators should study interventions that are sustainable and easily taken to scale if effective.

Key Definitions Social Determinants of Health (SDOH): the conditions in environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes. Such conditions lead to health disparities through systematic, direct and indirect effects on the development and progression of diseases and disorders as well as impacts on access to health promotion, prevention and treatment resources. For the purposes of this RFA, SDOH variables of interest include malleable factors that affect one's likelihood to use or misuse opioids and other substances or develop co-occurring conditions such as mental health disorders and suicide behaviors. For more information on SDOH see: [https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/social-determinants-health](https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/social-determinants-health). Multi-Level Intervention: a strategy to intervene on two or more ecological levels of influence. The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework (see: [https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/docs/research_framework/research-framework-slide.pdf](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/docs/research_framework/research-framework-slide.pdf)) identifies four levels of influence as the individual, interpersonal, community, and societal levels. For the purpose of this FOA, multi-level is defined in accordance with this framework. Purpose This funding opportunity announcement is part of the NIH's Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at: [https://heal.nih.gov/](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/heal-initiative). In 2019, 70,630 people in the United States died of drug overdose, and estimates suggest that this number will be well over 90,000 for 2020. Overdose death rates increased across demographic groups, but particularly in communities of color. Notably, increasing numbers of overdose deaths involved synthetic opioids and psychostimulants. Furthermore, national surveys and other data sources demonstrate that rates of co-occurring conditions are high. For example, among the millions of individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD), 27% have a serious mental illness, 64% have any mental illness, and approximately 11% to 26% have alcohol use disorder or another substance use disorder. Among those whose deaths are associated with opioid overdose (47,600 deaths in 2017 alone), up to 30% may be due to suicide. Nonfatal overdoses involving opioids are associated with elevated suicide risk. Moreover, the 16% of Americans who have mental health disorders receive over half of all opioids prescribed in the United States. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called for comprehensive and coordinated approaches to address the problem from clinicians, public health, public safety, community organizations, and the general public, incorporating innovative and established prevention and response strategies, including those focused on polysubstance use and comorbid mental health outcomes such as suicide ideation and behavior. Building the evidence base for comprehensive prevention approaches is critical to such efforts. To date, the development of preventive interventions to reduce risk for opioid misuse, opioid use disorder (OUD), polysubstance use, and adverse consequences of drug use has focused largely on individual-level interventions, modifying, for example, individual level attitudes, skills, or behaviors. However, there is growing recognition that social determinants of health (SDOH) influence peoples' life trajectories and are likely to shape their vulnerability to using, misusing, or developing an addiction to opioids and other substances and developing mental health disorders. While there are various ways to conceptualize SDOH, consistent among them are the emphasis on understanding the complex array of interconnected social, cultural, economic, and political factors that result in an inequitable distribution of health within a population. In the fall of 2020, The NIH HEAL Initiative supported a meeting on the social determinants of opioid and other drug use (recording available at [https://apps1.seiservices.com/SocialDeterminants/Default.aspx](https://apps1.seiservices.com/SocialDeterminants/Default.aspx)). A theme emerging from this meeting was that intervening only at the level of the individual ignores structural or systemic factors that play a role in the etiology and persistence of substance use, addiction, and mental health disorders. Further, individual approaches fail to account for contextual factors that might impact the likelihood that individual-level interventions will be effective. While multi-level interventions addressing SDOH may hold promise for improving population-level substance use outcomes, intervening on environmental and structural factors is complex, and studies testing strategies to intervene directly on SDOH to improve outcomes are limited. Research Objectives This initiative will support research that tests multi-level strategies for intervening directly on SDOH in order to reduce the risk for opioid misuse and co-occuring conditions. For the purposes of this RFA, co-occuring conditions refers to other substance misuse, mental health conditions and suicide. Prevention of opioid misuse/OUD can include prevention of 1) initiation of opioid misuse or polysubstance use or 2) progression from opioid misuse to OUD or injection drug use. Each study submitted in response to this RFA must include an opioid misuse-related prevention outcome, as primary, and a co-occurring condition outcome as secondary (e.g., other substance use, mental health condition, suicidal behavior). Research should be conducted within populations disproportionately affected by opioid use disorder, mental illness or death by suicide. This research initiative will concurrently build our understanding of 1) the impact of multi-level interventions designed to address SDOH on opioid misuse, other substance misuse/addiction and mental health disorders, 2) the mechanisms through which multi-level SDOH interventions that address SDOH exert their influence on targeted outcomes, and 3) the economic impacts of intervening on SDOH. NIH seeks to identify scalable strategies that will contribute to ending the opioid crisis. Therefore, proposed projects should be designed with consideration for barriers to implementation and dissemination. Priority will be given to research projects that are economical and have strong potential for impact, adoption, and sustainability. In addition, researchers should partner and collaborate with stakeholders and leaders of the entities that are expected to support the intervention at the end of the study period. Research Study Considerations Study Population and Sample Research projects should take place within the U.S. and its territories. Investigators should clearly define the population for whom selected outcomes will be studied and provide a justification for focusing on the population group or subgroup. The population can be defined geographically (e.g. zip-code, county), by another identifying characteristic (e.g., youth aging out of foster care, homeless individuals, individuals who do not complete high school, juvenile justice-involved youth), or by a combination of factors (homeless women; racial/ethnic minorities residing in a specific geographic region). Applicants should demonstrate that they have access to the communities, systems, or populations that will be enrolled in the intervention, and that collaborations are in place that are needed to conduct the research and to support its sustainability once the research study has ended, if the evidence supports this. Multi-level Intervention Interventions proposed through this initiative must be theory driven. Ideally, investigators will provide empirical support for selection of the multi-level intervention and/or the components of the multi-level intervention, including support for the complementarity of the chosen approaches. Interventions should modify risk and/or protective factors at two or more levels of influence (e.g., individual, interpersonal, community, or societal, per the [NIMHD framework](https://www.nimhd.nih.gov/about/overview/research-framework/nimhd-framework.html)). It is strongly recommended that the research strategy section include a conceptual model depicting 1) the intervention elements at each level and 2) the hypothesized pathways of influence from intervention to intermediate outcomes to selected primary and secondary outcomes. Examples of individual-level interventions targeting SDOH include, but are not limited to: Examples of interventions at the interpersonal, community, or societal levels targeting SDOH include, but are not limited to: Research Design, Measurement, and Analysis The primary goals of this initiative are to test the impact of the multi-level intervention on opioid and other substance misuse, OUD, and co-occurring conditions. Studies are required to examine the mechanisms of effects for SDOH, and conduct economic analyses to inform efforts to intervene on SDOH. Applicants should enumerate hypotheses to address the goals of the initiative and plan to use the most rigorous research design possible to address the research questions. Please note that pilot data to test the feasibility and efficacy the proposed multi-level intervention are not required. Investigators may propose a study in which (1) groups or clusters are assigned to study arms and individual observations are analyzed to evaluate the effect of the intervention, or (2) participants are assigned individually to study arms but receive at least some of their intervention in a real or virtual group or through a shared facilitator. Such studies may propose a parallel group- or cluster-randomized trial, an individually randomized group-treatment trial, a stepped-wedge design, or a quasi-experimental version of one of these designs. In these studies, special methods may be warranted for analysis and sample size estimation. Applicants are encouraged to consider designs that optimize or deconstruct multi-component interventions (e.g., interrupted time series for quasi experimental studies or factorial designs for clinical trials) or inform sequencing of components of complex interventions. Applicants should show that their methods are appropriate given their plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions. Additional information is available at [https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/](https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/). Measures utilized for the research may be derived from a variety of sources such as survey data, biomarkers, and administrative data. Survey measures should be well-established whenever possible; plans for the development of new indicators should be well-justified. As establishing common data elements is a priority for the NIH and would facilitate future data sharing, applicants are strongly encouraged to utilize measures included in the Social Determinants of Health Collection of the PhenX Toolkit ( [www.phenxtoolkit.org](http://www.phenxtoolkit.org)) when appropriate. Investigators and Study Partners The investigative team should be multi-disciplinary, including individuals with a strong understanding of the SDOH, the evolving opioid epidemic in America, comorbid mental health symptoms and disorders, prevention and/or early intervention research, and community-engaged research. In addition to scientific diversity, applicants should strive to incorporate diversity in their team development plan. Research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. Please refer to Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity [NOT-OD-20-031](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-031.html) for more details. The application should include a Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP) that describes how diverse perspectives advance the proposed specific aims and are integral to equity and inclusion in the science they perform. Examples of structures that promote diverse perspectives include but are not limited to: Strong methodological and statistical expertise is needed to ensure that the research is rigorously planned and executed and to select appropriate analytical procedures for quantifying intervention effects in the context of multi-level interventions. Research projects should include staff with expertise in cost measurement and economic analyses. Research teams must also include staff with expertise in data management, storage, and archiving, as projects will be expected to meet all requirements in the [NIH HEAL Initiative Public Access and Data Sharing Policy](https://heal.nih.gov/about/public-access-data). Engaging local officials and community collaborators as research partners early in the process is strongly encouraged as doing so will enhance the likelihood that the interventions are suitable for the context and will address the needs of the community. Applications should describe existing partnerships with systems, organizations, communities, and policymakers that are needed to facilitate the conduct of the research study. Projects should plan to involve a community advisory board that includes individuals from the participant population. Intervention Sustainability and Financing This initiative seeks to support research that has the potential for timely, wide-spread adoption and sustainability once the funding period ends if the intervention is demonstrated to be effective. Priority will be given to research projects for which the interventions are financed in-full or in-part through non-NIH funds during the study and projects where there is a clear commitment to incorporating successful strategies as standard practice. Applicants are requested to demonstrate local support for the sustainability of the intervention after the NIH award ends if the intervention outcomes are favorable. HEAL Funding Expectations The NIH HEAL Initiative will require a high level of coordination and sharing between investigators. It is expected that NIH HEAL Initiative recipientswill cooperate and coordinate their activities after awards are made by participating in Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) meetings, including an annual HEAL Investigators Meeting, as well as other activities. Special Considerations All applications must include each of the following elements within the research strategy section of the application. Submissions that do not meet these requirements will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed: National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Points to Consider Regarding Tobacco Industry Funding of NIDA Applicants The National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse (NACDA) encourages NIDA and its grantees to consider the points it has set forth with regard to existing or prospective sponsored research agreements with tobacco companies or their related entities and the impact of acceptance of tobacco industry funding on NIDA's credibility and reputation within the scientific community. Please see ( [http://ww2.drugabuse.gov/about/organization/nacda/points-to-consider.html](http://ww2.drugabuse.gov/about/organization/nacda/points-to-consider.html)) for details. Data Harmonization for Substance Abuse and Addiction via the PhenX Toolkit NIDA strongly encourages investigators involved in human-subjects studies to employ a common set of tools and resources that will promote the collection of comparable data across studies and to do so by incorporating the measures from the Core and Specialty collections, which are available in the Substance Abuse and Addiction Collection of the PhenX Toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org). Please see NOT-DA-12-008 ( [http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DA-12-008.html](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-DA-12-008.html)) for further details. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is interested in applications relevant to priorities described in this RFA and that support the NIMH Strategic Plan for Research. NIMH is committed to supporting research that reduces disparities and advances equity in mental health interventions, services, and outcomes. All applications that propose clinical trials should follow the NIMH's experimental therapeutics approach to intervention development and testing (see [https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas/index.shtml](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas/index.shtml)). That is, the scope of work must include specification of targets/mechanisms and assessment of intervention induced changes in the presumed targets/mechanisms that are hypothesized to account for the intervention's outcomes. In this manner, the results of the trial will advance knowledge regarding therapeutic change mechanisms and be informative regardless of trial outcomes (e.g., in the event of negative results, information about whether the intervention was successful at engaging its targets can facilitate interpretation). NIMH encourages a deployment-focused model of intervention and services design and testing that takes into account the perspective of relevant stakeholders (e.g., service users, providers, administrators, payers) and the key characteristics of the settings (e.g., resources, including workforce capacity; existing clinical workflows) that are intended to implement optimized mental health interventions. This attention to end-user perspectives and characteristics of intended clinical and/or community practice settings is intended to ensure: the resultant interventions and service delivery strategies are acceptable to consumers and providers, the approaches are feasible and scalable in the settings where individuals are served, and the research results will have utility for end users. NIMH encourages effectiveness research on potentially scalable preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions that focuses on practice-relevant questions. Accordingly, collaborations between academic researchers and clinical or community practice partners or networks are encouraged. When possible, studies should capitalize on existing infrastructure (e.g., practice-based research networks such as the NIMH-sponsored Mental Health Research Network (MHRN), electronic medical records, administrative data bases, patient registries, institutions with Clinical and Translational Science Awards) to increase the efficiency of participant recruitment (i.e., more rapid identification and enrollment) and to facilitate the collection of moderator data (e.g., clinical characteristics, biomarkers), longer-term follow-up data, and broader, stakeholder-relevant outcomes (e.g., mental health and general health care utilization, value and efficiency of intervention approaches). National Institute on Aging (NIA) The National Institute on Aging (NIA) is interested in applications relevant to the priorities described in this RFA. NIA intends to administer applications under this FOA that meet requirements central to NIA's mission of improving the health and well-being of older adults through research. NIA encourages projects consistent with the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development ( [https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dbsr/nih-stage-model-behavioral-intervention-development](https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dbsr/nih-stage-model-behavioral-intervention-development)), including examination of mechanisms of behavior change at every stage of intervention development, and projects addressing priorities outlined within the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework ( [https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/osp/framework)](https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/osp/framework)).

Any application awarded in response to this FOA will be subject to terms and conditions found on the [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11158) website. This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website. Individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA. ClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the \"responsible party\" must register and submit results information for certain \"applicable clinical trials\" on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website ( [https://register.clinicaltrials.gov](https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/)). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see [https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm) Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the awardee must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols. Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at [http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm](//grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm) and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&R) and PHS 398). Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE). 2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11120) as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157) and [Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11159). More information is provided at [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11158). Recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex. This includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency. The HHS Office for Civil Rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html) and [http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/civilrights/understanding/section1557/index.html). HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator's scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA.
