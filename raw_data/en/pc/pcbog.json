Flu shots are recommended as soon as they become available so as to avoid missing an opportunity to get vaccinated. However, because of the likelihood of diminished protection against flu later in the season, especially for older people, patients should consider getting vaccinated in September and October. As long as flu viruses are circulating, flu vaccination should continue, even during the month of January or later. The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has provided updated recommendations regarding influenza for 2023, including ideal timing for patients to receive flu vaccinations for the upcoming flu season. Who should get vaccinated? The CDC recommends that everyone who is six months and older get a flu vaccine every year. State, age and health restrictions may apply. Anyone who has concerns about getting a flu shot should talk to their pharmacist or healthcare provider.
