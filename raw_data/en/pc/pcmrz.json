POELCHAU (Under the Direction of Jim Hamrick) ABSTRACT In Central America, two major historical ev ents, the uplift of the Central American land bridge during the Pliocene, and Pl eistocene glacial epochs, may have significantly influenced the ecological and evolutionary histories of the region 's biota, especially its flora. However, the relative impact of these ev ents is still poorly underst ood. I ask whether 1) strong phylogeographic structure observed in three focal tree species can be attribut ed to colonization of the uplifting Pliocene landbridge, species' range cycles; 2) the three species' dist ributions, and distributions of wet- or dry forest obligate species, contracted into proposed refugi a during the last glacial maxi mum in the Pleistocene (LGM, 21,000 years ago); and 3) current, indirectly measured patterns of gene fl ow reflect historical vicariance, or current barriers to gene flow. In the first study, I use a comparative phylogeographic approach to determine the relativ e importance of Pleistocene climate change and Pliocene colonization patterns on contemporary patterns of chlo roplast sequence variation in three widespread lowland tree Bursera simaruba, Brosimum alicastrum, and Ficus insipida ). Dating and spatial arrangeme nt of three of the breaks placed population divergence in the Pleistocene. Signatures of range expansion, ho wever, were idiosyncratic across species, and did not match refugial expectations. While mu ch of the evidence points to common population divergence during the Pleistocene, it is possible that concordant phylogeogr aphic patterns are pseudo-congruent. In the second study, I use a paleoniche modeling approach to ask whether the focal species', and wet and dry forest obligate species', distributions overlap with proposed Pleistocene refugia. My results suggest that thes e species' distributions were not fragmented at the LGM, and call into question whet her forest taxa in general were restricted into refugia during the Pleistocene. Finally, I use a landscape genetic approach to identify current barriers to gene flow in the three focal species. I find that, contra ry to prior expectations, differential barriers to gene flow occur: only one species has limited ge ne flow due to elevation-mediated temperature differences. A second species' gene flow is rest ricted solely by dist ance, whereas the third species' genetic variation may still be contingent on historical effects.

While much research has been devoted to understanding how th is diversity is maintained (Janzen 1970; Connell 1971; Hubbell and Foster 1986; Wright 2002; Wills et al. 2006), evolutionary processes contributing to its origin have received comparatively little a ttention (Dick and Heuertz 2008). Phylogeographic and population genetic studies of intraspecific dive rsity are the first stages in describing the evolutionary history and traject ories of populations (A vise 2000; Storfer et al. 2007); this approach has been used to understand the basic process of gene flow, in particular on smaller scales, of neotropical flora (Murawski and Hamr ick 1991; Chase Hamrick 20 Trapnell and Hamrick 2004; Dick et al. 2007). Regional-scale studies are rare , in part due to logistic and technical difficulties. However, studying population genetic patterns at larger scales is essential to infer the processes driving the evolutionary history of species (Avise 2000). Furthermore, studi es attempting to identify the causes of population substructure an d diversification of neotropical flora are even rarer, because these causes are difficult to infer, in particul ar in regions as geologi cally and climatically variable as Central America (Brown 1987; Coat es and Obando 1996). However, some inferences of the causes of population dive rsification can be made by da ting population diversification (Arbogast et al. 2002), investiga ting spatial partitioning of populat ion substructure relative to 2biogeographic hypotheses (e.g. Bermingham and Mart in 1998), using climate-based methods to infer the sensitivity of neotropical flora to c limate change (Cowling et al. 2001; Peterson and Nyari 2008), and approaches that determine th e correlation of populati on substructure with putative current barriers to gene flow (Manel et al. 2003). In the following chapters, I use these approaches to identify factors contributing to pop ulation genetic structure and diversification in three widespread Central American tree species. In chapter 2, a comparative phylogeographic a pproach is used to ask whether the strong phylogeographic structure observed in three focal tree species ( Bursera simaruba, Brosimum alicastrum, and Ficus insipida zation of the uplifting Pliocene landbridge, and/or species' rang e contractions during Pleistocen e glacial cycles. In Central America, two major historical events, the uplift of the Central American land bridge during the Pliocene, and Pleistocene glacial epochs, may ha ve significantly influenced the ecological and evolutionary histories of the regi on's biota. However, the relative impact of these events on the vegetation in this region is still poorly unde rstood. In this stu dy, I find strong genetic differentiation where both Pliocene and Plei stocene breaks were hypot hesized, although the strength and exact location of the breaks vary somewhat among species, as might be expected. Dating of three breaks in two speci es suggests that these populations diverged in the Pleistocene. Signatures of range expansion, however, are id iosyncratic across species, and do not match refugial expectations. While much of the ev idence points to common population divergence during the Pleistocene, the proce ss of diversification is inconsis tent with population contraction into refugia, and likely reflects a complex overl ay of differentiation occurring across a common spatial and temporal framework. 3 In chapter 3, I ask whether Pleistocene climate conditions were limiting enough for the three focal species to have resulted in the Plei stocene divergence found in chapter 2. Because the Pleistocene distribution and extent of Central American forests, both wet and seasonally dry, is still unclear, I combine evidence from ecol ogical niche modeling, and the phylogeographic results from chapter 2, to test hypotheses of forest extent in Central America during the last glacial maximum (LGM). Using recently develope d global simulations of Pleistocene climate, ecological niche modeling techniques, and species' occurrence data, I gene rate paleodistribution models of the three focal tree species, which o ccur in wet and seasonally dry Central American forests. I contrast these results with predicti ons from wet- and seasonall y dry- forest obligate plant species. Niche modeling results suggest th at many species' distributions, regardless of forest type, were not restrict ed into refugia during the LGM. While constrained from higher elevations, most species found su itable habitat on newly exposed land due to lowered sea levels during the LGM. I discuss the imp lications of these findings for th e three focal tree species, and for future phylogeographic studies in this biodiverse region. While results from the previous two chapters help to uncover historical processes that may have contributed to population diversification of Ce ntral American trees, current patterns of genetic structure will unarguably be influenced by contemporary barr iers to gene flow, as well. Disentangling the effects of past and current barriers to gene flow may indeed be one of the most challenging obstacles to explaining population differentiation in Ce ntral America, an area where recent geological and climate change, and curr ent topographical and climatic gradients, may interact to influence patterns of genetic structure in trees. In chapter four, I use a comparative landscape genetic approach, where spatially explicit population genetic information is used to determine the physical causes of genetic stru cture, to test whethe r elevation-mediated 4temperature differences drive genetic differentia tion in three Central American lowland tree species. While one of the three tree species, Bursera simaruba , upholds this prediction, the other two species do not, suggesting th at geographic distance and landscape shape are more important in driving genetic distances in these species. Furthermore, I suggest that population genetic patterns are still contingent on historical events in at leas t one of our studied species, underscoring the importance of a historical fr amework when attempting to identify current barriers to gene flow. This study explicitly confir ms suggestions from previous studies of Central American tree species that imply that the intera ction of both historical and current barriers to gene flow determines contemporary population ge netic structure of tr ees in this region. 5CHAPTER 2 PHYLOGEOGRAPHY M.

However, the relative impact of these events on the vegetation in this region is still poorly understood. Here, we use a comparative phylogeographic approa ch to ask whether the strong phylogeographic structure observed in three focal tree species ( Bursera simaruba, Brosimum alicastrum, and Ficus insipida colonization of the uplifting Pliocene landbridge, and/or species' range contractions during Pleisto cene glacial cycles. We found strong genetic differentiation where both Pliocene and Plei stocene breaks were hypot hesized, although the strength and exact location of the breaks vari ed among species. Dating of three breaks in two species was possible with a coalescent appr oach, which placed population divergence in the Pleistocene. Signatures of range expansion, however, were idios yncratic across species, and did not match refugial expectations. While much of the evidence points to common population divergence during the Pleistocene, the process of diversification is inconsistent with population contraction into discrete ref ugia, and likely reflects a comp lex overlay of differentiation occurring across a common spatial and temporal framework. 72.1 INTRODUCTION The uplift of the Central American landbridge catalyzed the assembly of an intriguing and diverse array of tropical forest s at the interface of North and South America. Despite Central America's small area, it is one of the most biodi verse regions of the world, in part due to its extraordinary topographic and e nvironmental heterogeneity. Howe ver, little is known about the historical processes that have influenced the evolution and assembly of its floral components. Mountain ranges that arose during the uplift of the landbridge twen ty to three million years ago (e.g. Coates and Obando 1996) are thought to have profoundly impact ed the genetic connectivity of species present in this area (e.g. Savage 2002; Dick et al. 2 003; Castoe et al. 2009). Much more controversial is the impact of climate cha nge during Pleistocene glacial cycles (2.6 million - 20,000 years ago) on the distribution and extent of neotropical forest species , as well as species diversification (Haffer 1969; Colinvaux et al. 2000; Cowling et al. 2001; Lessa et al. 2003). Here, we use a comparative phylogeographic approach to test the effect of these two historical events on three common and widespread me mbers of the Central American flora. Central America's dynamic geological and clim atic history began in the Miocene. The uplift of the Central American landbridge, beginning roughly 20 million years ago (Ma) (Coates and Obando 1996), connected North and South America through a gradually rising and expanding island archipelago, which finally closed ca. 3 Ma (Figure 2.1a). However, the exact configuration of this uplift is still uncertain (Mann et al. 2007). Colonization of the archipelago by plant species could have occurred throughout th e period of uplift, poten tially dispersing seeds to previously uncolonized islands . However, long-distance coloniza tion events were likely rare, resulting in separately evol ving island populations connected by limited gene flow. These isolated populations would have come into dire ct secondary contact onl y after the land bridge 8closed. Therefore, if plant species coloni zed Central America during this time period, populations in the archipelago may have been separated long enough to be more genetically differentiated than their physical location w ould suggest (Brooks and McLennan 1991; Avise 2000). Land that subsequently conn ected the islands, in contrast, should have been colonized by a mixture of genotypes from adjacent \"island\" populations. Thus, barring extinctions, Pliocene island populations should have left a distinct, de tectable genetic footprin t on extant populations. A second event that likely impacted populati ons established during the Pliocene occurred during the Pleistocene, beginning about 2.6 Ma, well after the uplift of Central America had been completed. Periodic glacial epochs produced re peated environmental changes in Central America, the exact nature of which remain contr oversial. Pollen and fossil records from Central America suggest extensive savannas in some areas , and the expansion of montane vegetation into lower altitudes in other areas (Burnham and Graham 1999). Based on paleoclimatic, geological, and soil data, as well as vegetation patterns, Br own (1987) argued that montane refugia sustained lowland forest vegetation in Ce ntral America during the Pleisto cene glacial maxima, interrupted by savannas (Figure 2.1b; but see Colinvaux et al. 2000; Pennington et al. 2000). If these refugia persisted long enough, they may have generated di fferentiated refugial lineages that would come into secondary contact once climatic conditions improved. Populations colonizing previously unsuitable habitat (e.g., Nicaragua) should then repr esent an admixture of genetic diversity from the source populations (El Salvador, Costa Rica). In addition to historical ba rriers to gene flow, topographi c patterns found in present-day Central America likely contri bute to genetic differentiati on among plant populations. Tall mountain ranges bisect much of the area: the Ch ortis block highlands cover much of Northern Central America from southern Mexico to Nicar agua, and the Cordillera Central divides Costa 9Rica and northern Panama into distinct Pacific and Caribbean slopes. These mountain ranges are high enough that most lowland plants, and potentia lly their pollinators and seed dispersers, are restricted to lower elevations (Janzen 1967). These two distinct mountain ranges are separated by the Nicaraguan depression, and Lake Nicaragua, wh ich also interrupts the distribution of plant populations. Both the Chortis Bl ock highlands and the Cordille ra Central contribute to environmental differences between the Caribb ean and Pacific forests: Caribbean forests experience, mostly aseasonal rainfall, whereas the Pacific forests are seasonally dry (Janzen 1983). These precipitation differences lead to th e maintenance of markedly different plant and animal communities over relatively small spa tial scales (Janzen 1983). The strong topography, as well as the environmental differences, likely i nhibit gene flow and c ontribute to genetic differentiation among populations. Given the sustained interest in the generati on and maintenance of tropical diversity, and the resources invested in phylogeogr aphic analyses in the temperate zone, the relative dearth of phylogeographic information on neotropical plant populations is perhaps surprising. Studies of allozyme, chloroplast DNA, and nuclear DNA varia tion of tree species in Central America have shown that overall patterns of sp atial genetic structure appear to be idiosyncratic, suggesting that several processes may have structured geneti c variation across plant taxa. Strong genetic structuring has been found in a variety of unrelat ed tree species in both chloroplast and nuclear markers (Chase et al. 1995; Aide and Rivera 1998; Cavers et al . 2003a; Dick et al. 2003; Novick et al. 2003; Dick and Heuertz 2008), though this result is not always recovered (Miller and Schaal 2005; Dick et al. 2007). Ho wever, the studies with eviden ce of strong genetic structure showed patterns of varia tion that did not entirely coincide with present-da y barriers to gene flow. In particular, Cavers et al. (2003a) fo und chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) structure Cedrela 10odorata that spatially coincides the putative Pliocene islands and a proposed Pleistocene refugium. Additionally, a phylogeographic analysis of Symphonia globulifera dated the divergence of a trans-Andean clade (containing Central American and Ecuadorian elements) to the Pliocene or Miocene, suggesti ng that at least some elements of the Central American flora have been present for a consider able time (Dick et al. 2003). Over all, these studies suggest that plant species in Central America potentially have been subjected to many factors that would influence the distributio n of their genetic variation. These inferences beg the question whether members of Central American plant comm unities share a common environmental and demographic history due to geological and climatic events that occurred in their past, or whether the assembly of these communities has occurred idiosyncratically. While studies of spatial genetic patter ns can yield useful information on the biogeographic history of species, th e stochasticity inherent to the evolution of gene genealogies - in particular of single plastid ge nes - makes it difficult to ascertain whether a particular pattern is due to an extrinsic barrier to gene flow, or si mply due to chance (Avise 2000; Irwin 2002; Hey and Machado 2003). An increasingly feasible altern ative is to collect in formation from multiple, unlinked nuclear genes, which can substantially improve esti mates of population genetic parameters (Hare 2001) . Alternatively, or additionally, single gene genealogies of multiple co- distributed species can be studi ed, reasoning that similar spatia l configurations of genetic variation that occur across multiple, unrelated sp ecies are indicative of a common biogeographic history (Avise 2000). This appr oach, called comparative phyloge ography, has provided useful insights into historical proce sses that may have influenced the evolution of vertebrate communities in diverse regions (D a Silva and Patton 1998; Schneider et al. 1998; Carstens et al. 2005). 11Based on patterns of genetic variation found in prior studi es, and from what is known about the geology of the area and th e effect of Quaternary glacial cycles on the distribution of forests, we ask a series of questions to de termine which historical mechanisms may have generated current patterns of gene tic variation in three widespread tree species. We test whether only Pliocene, Pleistocene, or both Pliocene a nd Pleistocene vicariance has affected population genetic structure across species (Figures 2.1a-c). First, we determine whether regional structuring of genetic variation occurs acr oss species. If genetic structure occurs, we ask whether it is spatially consistent with Pliocene and/or Pleistocene vicariance, and whether genetic subdivisions are temporally consistent with Pl iocene or Pleistocene divergence. Specifically, with Pliocene divergence, we pr edict sharp genetic transitions wh ere the boundaries of Pliocene islands lay, and that divergence between populations on either side of this boundary would date to the Pliocene or earlier (> 3 Ma; Figure 2.1a ). Tree populations affected by Pleistocene glacial cycles, instead, should have gene tic divergence at the proposed re fugial boundaries, which would date within the extent of the Pleistocene (< 2.6 Ma; Figure 2.1b). Concomitantly, we expect to find patterns of range expansion in areas that were presumably uninhabitable during Pleistocene glacial maxima (e.g. Nicaragua, Panama). Fina lly, both Pliocene geological, and Pleistocene climatic events may have influenced genetic va riation in the Central Am erican landbridge. While an overlay of both processes may be difficult to di stinguish, we expect to find later divergence at the El Salvadorian Pleistocene br eak, and earlier diverg ence at the Costa Rican break, as spatial coincidence of Pliocene and Pleistocene boundaries would likely reinforce the existing genetic structure (Figure 2.1c). For a summar y of our predictions, see table to upper-canopy trees that range fr om Mexico to South America (Croat 1978). These species were chosen based on their broad distribution, their co-occurrence in similar forest sites, and to reflect a diversity of pollination and fruit-dispersal modes. They thrive in both wet and dry lowland forests, but are more common in dry forests (MFP pers. obs.). B. simaruba is insect-pollinated and predominately bird -dispersed (Croat 19 78). There are reports of adaptations to both wind- (Berg 2001) and in sect- (Croat 1978; Berg 1990) pollination in B. alicastrum. It is dispersed by a variety of animals (b irds, monkeys, bats, and secondary dispersal by rodents) (Croat 1978). Ficus insipida is wasp-pollinated (Machado et al. 2001) , grows both in secondary forest, as well as in riparian habitats, and is disp ersed by monkeys, bats, and fish (Croat 1978; Banack et al. 2002). While there is no fossil evidence suggesting the origin of any of the three species, the geographi c location of the majority of species in each genus may give some indication of their geographic origin. Based on this logic, the likely origin of B. simaruba is in Mexico, while B. alicastrum and F. insipida arose in South America. Population sampling. In June through October 2007, we collected leaf tissue from each of approximately 30 populations per species through out lower Central America, from western Panama, throughout Costa Rica, western Nicaragu a, and El Salvador, spanning two postulated glacial refugia, and two Pliocen e seaways (Figure 2.1a-c; Table 2.2) . Tissue samples were dried and stored in silica gel. The majority of samp les were collected from national parks, although some material was taken from road sides or private properties (mainly B. simaruba , which is used as a \"living fence\" throughout Central America. While B. alicastrum seeds have been used by humans in the past, they do not recru it outside the forest; MFP pers. obs.). 13Genetic data collection. We extracted DNA with a modified CTAB protocol (Doyle and Doyle 1990). We used primers from Shaw et al. (2005) to amplify the trnG (primers 3'trnGUUC and l DNA (5-60 ng), 1x Sigma PCR buffer, 3.0 mM MgCl 2, 200 M of each dNTP, 2x BSA, 0.2 M of each primer, and 1 U JumpStartTM Taq polymerase (Sigma). The following cycling conditions were used: An initial denaturati on step at 80\u00ba C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles of 94\u00ba C for 1 minute, 55\u00ba C for 1 minute, and 72\u00ba C for 2 minutes; a nd a final extension of 72\u00ba C for 5 minutes. 5 l PCR product was then purified with 5000 U ExoI and 500 U Antarctic Phosphatase mixed in 1x Sigma PCR buffer. We sequenced cleaned amp licons with BigDye chemistry (1/8 volume, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). A s ubset (~10%) of the reactions was sequenced in the reverse direction to verify the quality of the forward sequences; no conflicts between forward and reverse sequences were detected. DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI 3730 automated sequencer. We tested a series of published nuclear primer s on all three species. Only one primer pair, NIA-i3 (Howarth and Baum 2002), amplified with some reliability and was polymorphic in one species, B. simaruba . This primer pair amplifies the thir the nitrate and 2002). obtained NIA-i3 sequences using the same PCR and sequencing conditions as the chloroplast primers. All sequences have been deposited in GenBank (Accession numbers GQ436789 - GQ438211). We edited DNA chromatograms in Sequencher 4.1 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, Michigan) and aligned them using the Cl ustalW multiple alignment routine in BioEdit (Hall 1999) with the default parameters, and su bsequently adjusted sequences manually. We found several indels ( : 2; B. alicastrum : 2; B. alicastrum : 2; F. insipida : 1) in the sequence sets. We coded indels that were more than one base pair long as single base pa ir changes, and removed all poly-T regions. We used concatenated sequences for all subsequent analyses. Haplotype netw orks were constructed in NETWORK (Fluxus Technology Ltd.) using th e median joining algorithm (Bandelt et al. 1999). DNA sequence polymorphism for each (Watterson's , ) was calculated intron sequences only one poly-T region th at was homozygous in five individuals, which we removed. Because of th e lack of heterozygous indels, heterozygous polymorphisms could be identified visually. Nucl ear haplotypes were then resolved using the program PHASE using the default parameter set tings (Stephens and Donnelly 2003). As fewer nuclear sequences were obtained than chloroplast sequences, and only for one species, we only use these data for estimates of divergence time between B. simaruba populations (see below). Spatial genetic patterns . We used the web interface FindModel (http://www.hiv.lanl.gov /content/sequence/fi ndmodel/findmodel.html ) to find the evolutionary model that best fit the sequence data for each species. FindModel constructs a tree from the data using Weighbor (Bruno et al. 2000); evaluates the likelihood using the program PAML (Yang 2007); and uses the method from MODELTEST to cal culate AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) scores (Posada and Crandall 1998). Tamura-Nei was the most likel y model available for all three species, though other substitution models yielded vi rtually identical results (data not shown). To describe overall population stru cture, we conducted an Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) in the program Arlequin v. 3.1 (Excoffier et al. 2005) using Tamura-Nei corrected genetic distances. 15Reconstructions of the landbri dge during the Pliocene, and in particular locations of Pleistocene refugia, are likely approximate, part icularly relative to the sampling resolution of our study. Therefore, we used the program BARRIER v 2.2 (Manni et al. 2004) to determine whether genetic breaks occurred in the dataset, and whether these breaks spatially coincide with proposed Pliocene or Pleistocene breaks (Figure 2.1a-c). BARRIER v 2.2 constructs a geometric network of geo-referenced locations via Delaune y triangulation. Monmonier's algorithm is then used to locate areas of maximum genetic dist ance within the tria ngulation network, thus identifying genetic \"boundaries\" between adjace nt locations. Since BARRIER requires the user to supply genetic distance matrices, we calcu lated Tamura-Nei population average pairwise distances (dA, Nei and Li 1979) for each specie s in Arlequin (Excoffier et al. 2005). The significance of each distance was computed via pe rmutation test with 1000 permutations. BARRIER v 2.2 allows the user to import multiple bootstrapped genetic distance matrices. The program calculates boundaries for each matrix, and generates a figure where the boundary thickness is proportional to its bootst rap value. We generated 100 bootstrapped datasets by resampling individuals within popula tions with replacement using the R statistical language (http://www.r-project.or g) and PopTools (Hood 2008). Ta mura-Nei average pairwise distance matrices were calculated using an Arle quin batch file, and the matrices were imported into BARRIER v 2.2 to generate bootstrapped ba rriers. This bootstrap me thod was only possible with B. simaruba , as low within-population variation in B. alicastrum and F. insipida rendered resampling within populations meaningless. For these two species, we limited the number of barriers for BARRIER v 2.2 to find to three, which is the maximum number of boundaries expected under our historical models. 16 To determine whether significant regional structure occurred in the B. simaruba NIA-i3 sequences that was spatially cons istent with the structure, we calculated a hierarchical AMOVA in Arlequin (Excoffier et al. 2005) on the nDNA dataset, partitio ning the data based on the regions identified by BARRIER v 2.2 in the cpDNA. Divergence time estimates . We used the program IMa (Hey and Nielsen 2007) to date the divergence of regions id entified in BARRIER v 2.2. This appr oach is based on a non-equilibrium model of population splitting with gene flow (hence isolation w ith migration- IM), and can estimate divergence time of two populations whil e accounting for migration between them. It applies a likelihood/Bayesian method to fit six pa rameters of the IM model to sequence data taken from individuals in two populati ons. Parameters of interest are: = 4N for one ancestral and two daughter populations, where N is effective population size, and is the mutation rate per gene and year; scaled divergence time, t = T; and two scaled directional migration rates, m = m/. The peak of the estimated posterior distributi on is taken as the parameter estimate, together with the 90% highest posterior density interval (HPD). While posterior di stributions obtained for these parameters- in particular t- can be wide, this method is still feasible to test hypotheses distinguishing longer time scales, such as those proposed in this study (e.g. Carstens et al. 2005). It should be stressed that estimates of t and m from cpDNA reflect gene flow and divergence from maternally transmitted genes only, as most seed plants transmit cpDNA maternally (Sears 1980; McCauley et al. 2005). Es timates derived from nuclear DNA, on the other hand, reflect patterns of genes transmitted by both seed and pollen. We assigned an inheritance scalar of 0.25 to th e chloroplast data to account for the four- fold lesser effective population size of the chloroplast DNA. We used the Hasegawa-Kishino- 17Yano (HKY, Hasegawa et al. 1985) model of se quence evolution for the cpDNA of all three species to account for multiple mutations at a si te, and the infinite sites model for NIA-i3. IMa assumes no recombination within loci. If chloroplast DNA is inherited strictly maternally, then it can be assumed that recombin ation rarely occurs (Sea rs 1980; McCauley et al . 2005); however, nuclear DNA regions are likely to have undergone recombination. Therefore, we split the NIA-i3 dataset into 3 non-recombini ng regions with the program IMgc (Woerner et al. 2007), which implements the four-gamete te st to divide sequence datasets into non- recombining regions. We used the largest non-re combining region (305 bp) in conjunction with the chloroplast data to estimate di vergence times between regions in B. simaruba ; we used only the chloroplast data for the other two species. As IMa can only account for divergence be tween two populations, we ran models on adjacent pairs of regions, based on the geneti c breaks identified by BARRIER v 2.2. The model implicitly assumes that gene flow only occurs between adjacent regions (Hey and Nielsen 2007). Initially, we conducted runs to determine appropr iate upper bounds for the priors. For runs where the distribution of divergence time converged (s ee results below), we used the upper 95% HPD limit of the time to the most recent common an cestor (TMRCA) from preliminary runs as the upper limit of the prior distribution on t (following Peters et al. 2007), reasoning that it is unlikely for population divergence time to exceed the TMRCA . For B. simaruba , we averaged the upper 95% HPD limit of the TMRCA for the cpDNA and nDNA datasets. We used a burn-in of 106 steps, and ran the pr ogram for at least 107 steps, recording every 10th step (the default setting). We assessed whether a run had suffi ciently converged based on the ESS (effective sample size) score, which represents the number of independent points sampled for each parameter; we used 50 as the minimum ESS cu toff to determine convergence (Hey 2007). We 18used a geometric heating scheme with heating parameters 0.95 and 0.8, and ran 50 chains, with eight chain swapping attempts per step. We conduc ted three runs of each paired region, with different random number seeds. In addition, we recorded the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for each run, and calculated its 90% highest posterior density (HPD) intervals from the marginal densities. We used a range of substitution rates to c onvert the resulting parameter estimates to demographic scales, as there is no biogeographic or fossil eviden ce to independently calibrate substitution rates for these species. Previously published estimates of chloroplast substitution rates range from a lower limit of 1 x 10-9 substitutions per site per year (s/s/y) for chloroplast- wide substitution rate s (Wolfe et al. 1987) , to an upper estimated limit of 8.24 x 10-9 s/s/y for the trnL-F region of the chloropl ast (Richardson et al. 2001). We report parameter estimates from both substitution rates below. Because substitution rate estimates for NIA-i3 are unavailable, we used chloroplast DNA substitution rates and mutati on rate scalars estimated by IMa to convert divergence estimates for B. simaruba to calendar years (Hey and Nielsen 2004). Range expansion . A separate prediction of Pleistocene re fugia is that these areas should show signatures of range expansion, as suggested by a negative Tajima's D (Tajima 1989). Tajima's D is a widely used measure to detect divergence of a set of sequence data from neutrality or equilibrium. Briefly, it is based on the scaled difference between , the number of pairwise differences between sequences in sample, S, or th e number of segregating s ites, and corrected for sample size. A non-zero Tajima's D indicates a de parture from equilibrium: A negative Tajima's D generally implicates an excess of rare alleles, which is consistent with a selective sweep, or alternatively recent range expansion and population gr owth, given that the locus of interest is not under selection. A positive Tajima's D demonstrates a paucity of rare alleles, which may indicate 19balancing selection, or range contraction or population admixt ure if the locus is neutral . We calculated Tajima's D for each population in th e software DnaSP (Rozas et al. 2003). Confidence intervals for Tajima's D were comput ed using the coalescent simulation option given by the program. 2.3 RESULTS Sequence and population diversity. We successfully obtained sequences from the trnG intron and trnH-psbA intergenic spacer from 278, 210, and 222 individuals from B. simaruba, B. alicastrum, and F. insipida , respectively, as well as Nia-3 sequences from 45 B. simaruba individuals (Table 2.2). Variation in template quality restricted us to sequence fewer than ten individuals per population. Additionally, some species were not present at every collection site. Species varied in the number of chloroplast haplotypes found: B. simaruba showed a strikingly number of chloroplast haplotypes (31), followed by B. alicastrum (16) and F. insipida (15), which exhibited much more ty pical numbers. Watterson's was highest in B. simaruba, with B. alicastrum and F. insipida ranked 2 nd and 3rd, respectively (Table 2.3). B. simaruba and B. alicastrum had higher diversity, in terms of , than F. insipida (Table 2.3) . The AMOVA revealed fairly high am ong-population diversity in B. simaruba (57.5% of the genetic variation was partitioned among populations) and F. insipida (61.55%), in contrast with B. alicastrum (80.57%). Patterns of haplotype structure. The most striking observati on from the distribution of chloroplast haplotypes is that all three spec ies show haplotypic tu rnover near the Costa Rica/Nicaragua border (Figure 2.2a -c, Table 2.4). Widespread hapl otypes occurred in all three species, although their frequency varied between species. Consistent with the relatively low among-population variance found in B. simaruba, one B. simaruba haplotype was present in 2038% of all populations. While B. simaruba had a large number of haplotypes, there was no apparent clade structure in the haplotype ne twork (Figure 2.2a). Haplotypes were more regionally B. , populations in Nicar agua harboring distinct haplotypes (Figure 2.2b). F. insipida showed evidence of shared haplotypes between El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama, while populations in Nicaragua and northern Costa Rica were distinct (Figure 2.2c). A hallmark of many phylogeographic analyses, in particular of low- dispersing organisms, are prominent, geographically structured clades (Avise 2000). Simple vi sual inspection of the haplotype networks and maps suggests that our study organisms do not follow such a straightforward interpretation; wh ile geographically structured hapl otype patterns are present, the presence of widespread haplot ypes, either due to gene flow or incomplete lineage sorting, precludes any analysis that exclusively matches clades to geography. Nonetheless, similarly distributed genetic turnover observed across mu ltiple species may still indicate that common historical barriers to gene flow occurred, ev en though the process by wh ich genetic differences arose across this barrier may di ffer between species, whether due to different colonization histories of the studied area, diffe rent levels of gene flow, or ge netic drift. We used Monmonier's algorithm as implemented in the program BA RRIER v 2.2 to ask whether and where high genetic differentiation occurs in all three datasets. This analys is confirmed patterns of strong genetic change close to the proposed Costa Rica/Ni caragua Pliocene break in all three species, as well as the Costa Rican Pleistocene break in B. simaruba , even though the exact spatial location and the relative rank of this break varied between species (Figure 2.2a-c, Table 2.4). Other barriers idiosyncratic to each species were unveiled, as well. 21In B. simaruba , the genetic data initially sepa rated into three regions based on bootstrapped genetic distances: Nicaragua/El Salva dor, the Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica, and the remainder of Costa Rica/Panama (Figure 2. 2a). Bootstrap support for the main identified boundary ranged from 40 to 86%; the highest bo otstrap support for boun daries not used in regional subdivision is 36%. This division coinci des with the proposed Pliocene break, as well as with the Costa Rican Pleistocene division. Howe ver, the only populati on pair separating the Nicaragua/El Salvador group from the Ni coya peninsula had a non-significant d A value (ElO- SaR, Table 2.4). Therefore, we chose to conduct s ubsequent analyses with the Nicoya peninsula grouped into a single region with El Salvador and Nicaragua. Hierarchical partitioning of variation of the nuclear DNA based on cpDNA regions was significant (65.24% within populations, 19.09% among populations within re gions, 15.68% among regions, p < 0.001 for all hierarchies), justifying the use of th e nDNA in divergence time estimation. B. alicastrum populations showed the highest subdivi sion in central Nicaragua, where no phylogeographic break was predicted (Figure 2.2b). This is due in part to the presence of a divergent clade in northern Nica ragua that was not observed in any other regions. The second and third strongest barriers, however, partitione d El Salvador and Costa Rica/Panama into separate regions, coinciding with the predicted Salvadorian Pl eistocene break, and the Costa Rican Pliocene break. Our collections of B. alicastrum revealed an area of low density, or perhaps even a disjunct dist ribution, of this species in Southwestern Costa Rica and Northwestern Panama: we were unable to find indi viduals of this species in the sites surveyed. Therefore, while genetic distan ces between the 'closest' populations in Panama and Costa Rica are large (d A ranged from 3.4 to 6 ), no barrier wa s detected by Monmonier's algorithm, presumably because geographic distances were larg e relative to genetic distances (Mantel test of 22Costa Rican and Panamanian populations, right-ta iled p = 0.001 after 999 permutations). As the genetic distance between Costa Rican and Panamani an populations in this area is likely the result of isolation by distance, we c onducted subsequent analyses with the Panamanian populations lumped with Costa Rican populations. Spatial genetic patterns in F. insipida were similar to those in B. alicastrum, in that the first and second ranked breaks separated El Salva dor and Costa Rica; a divergent population in Northwestern Costa Rica (HLI) was also identifie d (Figure 2.2c). A third barrier separated one population on the Southwestern coast of Costa Rica (Car); this populati on harbored haplotypes similar to those found in both Nicaragua and Cost a Rica, suggesting an ad mixture of haplotypes from two separate regions in th is population. One non-significant d A value occurred within a barrier (Table 2.4, ElO-RiT). To assuage the concer n that haplotype structur e in this region could be driven solely by the \"outlier \" population HLI, we re-ran the an alysis without this population. The first ranked break still occurred in the ar ea, this time grouping one population, RiT, with Nicaragua, which suggests that the change in th e spatial location of this break is minor (dA values between RiT and adjacent Costa Rican populations: 2.77, 3.42, p < 0.01). Therefore, we chose to conduct subsequent analyses with the original spatial configuration of populations. Divergence time estimates. In an effort to estimate dive rgence times between regions while accounting for gene flow between them, and to determine whether divergence time estimates better match Pliocene or Pleistocene expecta tions, we performed IMa analyses on adjacent regions for each species. Results from all th ree runs for each regional pair were highly correlated; therefore, we only report results from the first run (See Appendix 2.1 for results from all runs). Despite long runtimes, sufficient mixing of chains, and low au tocorrelation, several of the regional pairs contained too little informati on to reliably estimate divergence times between 23regions. This manifested itself in marginal de nsities with a single peak at low probability, followed by a long tail with slightly lower probab ility that extended thro ughout the range of bimodal distributions with an extended probab ility tail; or sometimes in a complete lack of a peak, with probability increasing to the end of the prior range. However, IMa runs of several paired regions yielded ma rginal distributions of t with a single, sharp p eak of high probability followed by a long tail of considerably lower probab ility that never dropped to zero- a feature of estimates of divergence time in IMa when the info rmation in the data is insufficient (Won et al. 2005) (Figure 2.3, table 2.5) . In these cases, the mode of the distribution cannot be treated as a maximum likelihood estimate, and it makes little sense to estimate 90% HPD, as much of the probability mass lies outside the peak region. Instea d, we report the value of the bin with the highest residence time from the MCMC simulati ons, which can be viewed as minimum estimates of divergence time, with some probability of later divergence. Additiona lly, we calculate the % area underneath the diverg ence time curve that o ccurs in the Pleistocene (< 2.6 Ma) vs. the Pliocene (> 3 Ma) for both slow and fast substitution rates as a heuristic for th e likelihood that the event happened in one period vs. the other. In B. simaruba , the divergence time between El Salvador/Nicaragua and Costa Rica/Panama peaked within the Pleistocene fo r both fast and slow substitution rates ( tslow = 1.782 Ma, tfast = 0.216 Ma, Figure 2.3, Table 2.5). All of the probability mass of divergence time curve placed in the Pleistocene, given the fast subs titution rate; when divergence time was calculated with the slow substitution rate, 39.6% of the area under the curve occurred in the Pleistocene, and 55.0% in the Pliocene. Interestingly, migrati on was highly asymmetric : the estimated gene flow parameter from Costa Rica/Pan ama into El Salvador/Nicaragua (m 2 = 0.0075) was roughly 700 times smaller than the re verse migration parameter (m 1 = 5.25), opposite of our expectations, 24although their 90% HPD intervals overla pped (Table 2.5). The estimate of A suffered from similar convergence problems as divergence time: a clear peak occurred, but the posterior distribution did not fall to 0 (Table 2.5). Divergence between El Salvador and Northe rn Nicaragua, and Sout hern Nicaragua and Costa Rica/Panama for B. alicastrum peaked in the Pleistocene, given the of SNI-CR: 25,221 - 207,824 years; Figure 2.3, Table 2.5). Migration rates between regions were fairly symmetrical (Table 2.5). Again, the density of A rose gradually throughout the prior range, precludi ng a proper estimate of the parameter. As in B. simaruba, the entire probability mass of divergence time for both regional comparisons placed in the Pleistocene, given the fast substitution ra te. For divergence between El Salvador and Northern Nicaragua (ES-NNI), 49.6% of the area underneath the curve placed in the Pleistocene, as opposed to 46.2% in the Pliocene, when calib rated with the slower substitution rate. For divergence between Southern Nicaragua and Co sta Rica (SNI-CR), 39.6% of the probability mass occurred in the Pleistocen e, and 58.4% in the Pliocene. For models of F. insipida regional divergence, we conduc ted runs where the 'outlier' populations, HLI and Car, were included or exclud ed from adjacent regions. As results did not vary qualitatively between mode ls, we only report results from runs where Car and HLI are merged with the Costa Rican region. Marginal de nsities of divergence between Costa Rican and Nicaraguan populations were bimo dal and did not converge. This pattern persisted with and without inclusion of the 'outli er' populations HLI and Car into neighboring regions, which had very little qualitative effect on any of the parameter estimates. The marginal density for divergence between El Salvador and Nicaragua was flat thro ughout the prior range, and thus uninformative. Again, marginal posterior densities of A did not converge. The most likely value 25for migration from El Salvador to Nicaragua approached 0 ( m = 0.005), although its 90% HPD intervals overlapped with those of migr ation from Nicaragua to El Salvador ( m = 0.485). CR (10.85) was significantly higher than ES (0.0132) and NI (ES-NI: 0.9652, CR-NI: 0.6749). Range expansion. We measured Tajima's D each popul ation to infer whether recent (post- Pleistocene) range expansion may have occurred. If Costa Rica and El Salvador had served as Pleistocene refugia, we would expect to find negative Tajima's D in Nicaraguan and Panamanian populations. The trends that we f ound were not straightforward. In B. simaruba , only one population in the southern Costa Rican region showed a negative Tajim a's D (CeB, Table 2.3). Several populations, however, had a positive Tajima's D, which can indicate population contraction (Costa Rica: 2 populations; Panama: 1 populati on; Nicaragua: 1 population). B. alicastrum had a negative value of Tajima's D in one Panamanian population (LaT : D = - 1.55311, p < 0.01), consistent with expectations of range expansion in Panama. Significantly negative values were found in one Costa Rican p opulation, and positive values in two others. In F. insipida , one Nicaraguan population had a negative Ta jima's D, consistent with Pleistocene expectations (Mir, D = -1.5347, p < 0.05); as well as one Costa Rican population (Car, D = - 1.43414, p < 0.05). All other Nicaraguan populations were monomorphic, for which Tajima's D is undefined. 2.4 DISCUSSION Our data reveal common spatial di visions of genetic structure acro ss all three species close to the Costa Rican/Nicaraguan border, consistent with both Pliocene and Pleistocene expectations; genetic differentiation by the El Salvadorian/Nicaraguan border in two of the species, fitting Pleistocene expectations; and furt her breaks idiosyncratic to each species (Figure 2.1a, b; Figure 2.2a, c, d). Our analysis of dive rgence times at these breaks in B. simaruba and B. alicastrum 26tentatively suggest that they were generated in the Pleistocene, while our data do not contain enough information to make any temporal inferences about popul ation divergence in F. insipida. Subsequent analyses of equilibr ium to test expectations norma lly associated with refugial dynamics do not reveal a straightforward patter n consistent with populat ion contraction into Costa Rica and El Salvador. Instead, each spec ies has idiosyncratic patterns of population expansion and contraction. Together, these results suggest th at the genetic break we found in Northern Costa Rica may be an area of pseudoc ongruence- suggesting that the variation found in individual species was subject to different processes in the same area, resulting in a spatially coincident genetic break. This is perhaps not su rprising given that each species may have had a different colonization pattern of the landbridge, and given the interaction each species may have experienced between the numerous glacial cycl es during the Pleistocen e, the strong topography in the region, and species-specific differences in ecological tolerances. Ho wever, considering the complex history of the area, it is all the more significant to find any evidence of concordant boundaries across unrelated species in an area that lacks obvious cu rrent barriers to gene flow. Our study confirms patterns of hapl otype structure that have been found in other plant species in this area, in particular Cedrela odorata (Cavers et al . 2003), and, on a rubescens Hamrick 2004) and Hamrick, in review). Patterns of haplotype structure. We found evidence for strong ha plotypic turnover in all three species close to the proposed Pliocene/Pleistoce ne break at the Costa Rican/Nicaraguan border. In addition, B. alicastrum and F. insipida demonstrated different iation at the proposed Pleistocene break in El Salvador. Genetic di fferentiation of Salvadorian from Nicaraguan populations in B. simaruba was not observed, suggesting that this species did not have a Pleistocene refugium in El Sa lvador (Figure 2.2a). There are a number of reasons why only two 27species could show evidence of this break. First, this may be due to differences in ecological tolerances between species. While all thr ee species show broad lowland distributions, B. simaruba is more widespread, and can be found in many habitat types, in contrast to B. alicastrum and F. insipida , which are mostly found in ripari an areas, particul arly north of Panama (MFP pers. obs.). If these two species are truly ecologically similar to each other, they would be expected to respond similarly to changing climatic conditions. In addition, B. alicastrum and F. insipida have different distributions than B. simaruba : B. simaruba does not range into South America, while the other two species are distri buted both in South America and in Mexico (http://www.tropicos.org/), and may have colonized Central America from South America, whereas B. simaruba may have originated in Mexico. Similar colonization patterns of the landbridge from South America may have resulte d in similar patterns of haplotypic turnover, yet discordant signatures of phylogeographic structure. An ideal analysis using Monmonier's algorithm would have sampled evenly spaced populations, as large distances betw een populations are more likely to reveal patterns of isolation by distance, rather than genetic breaks (Manni et al. 2004). Unfortunate ly, accessible populations do not always occur naturally evenly spaced, wh ich was the case for all of the species we sampled, but in particular for B. alicastrum in Southwestern Costa Rica (Figure 2.2c). However, most of the breaks we detected did not occur between distantly spaced populations, indicating that these breaks are not artifacts of isolation by distance. Additionally, as we used Tamura-Nei corrected average pairwise distances, the breaks that were found should reflect phylogenetic distance between adj acent populations. Divergence time estimates . The paired regions that containe d enough information to gain point estimates of divergence times placed the divergence of two breaks in B. alicastrum and one 28break in B. simaruba in the Pleistocene (smoothed point estimates: 0.6 - 1.7 Ma, Table 2.5). Additionally, all of the probability mass of diverg ence time for the three breaks placed in the Pleistocene, given the fast s ubstitution rate; and 3 9.6 - 49.6% of the probability mass dated to the Pleistocene when calibrated with the slow substitution rate. We could not reject the hypothesis that other regions test ed in these species and in F. insipida did not diverge earlier, as these datasets presumably did not contain enoug h information to gain more reliable parameter estimates. There are numerous assumptions to be considered when estimating divergence times with IMa. First and foremost, due to the inherent variance associated with the coalescent process, it is difficult to gain accurate estimates of any parameter with only a single locus dataset. It remains problematic to find suitable nuclear re gions of the genome to sequence in non-model organisms, and we were successful to a certain ex tent in finding such a re gion in only one of our three species. As a consequence, we were unable to properly estimate parameters of several of the paired regions in our datase t; and of those where a sharp peak of Pleistocene divergence was found, there was still some probabili ty of earlier divergence, as th e marginal density estimate did not fall to zero within the bounds of the pr ior distribution (Figur e 2.3, Table 2.5). Another assumption of the IM model is that the two populations under consideration do not exchange genes with other populations- a consideration th at our study, as well as many other population- level studies that use th e IM method, certainly violates. If populations are exchanging genes with populations that are not included in the dataset, the effective size of the ancestral population will likely be overestimated; its eff ect on the estimate of divergence time, however, is unclear (Won et al. 2005). While we attempted to mitigate th is problem by dividing our dataset into regions separated by high spatial genetic differences, large (or non-conve rged) estimates of ancestral population size in most of our simulations sugges t that gene flow from other populations still 29may have occurred. Finally, the accuracy of muta tion rates is a major problem plaguing estimates of divergence times in any organism lacking external fossil or biogeographic evidence to calibrate rates. To allow for this inaccuracy, we chose a broad range of substitution rates found across angiosperm chloroplasts, and were still able to place the divergence times between some regions within the Pleistocene (Figure 2.3, Tabl e 2.5). Additionally, this substitution rate range may even be conservative, as these calibrations were based on regions of the chloroplast that typically show less variation than the trnH-psb A spacer and the trnG region (Shaw et al. 2005). This suggests that the regions we sequenced ev olved faster, which woul d make the divergence time more recent. Range expansion. If populations of our studied species pe rsisted in refugia in El Salvador and Costa Rica during Pleistocene glac ial cycles, a prediction is that they should currently show evidence of range expansion into Nicaragua and Panama. While some populations show non- equilibrium patterns consistent with range expansion into Nicaragua and Panama ( B. alicastrum in Panama, F. insipida in Nicaragua), we do not find consis tent overall evidence for Pleistocene range expansion across species (Table 2.3). Similar results have been found in studies of several mammal species in South America (Lessa et al. 2003). There is a possibili ty that some of the observed patterns are due to selection - assuming no recombination in the chloroplast, selection on chloroplast genes would be reflected thr oughout the plastid genome - however, our study design does not allow us to distinguish between demography and selection; and selection alone still fails to explain the geogr aphically haphazard patte rns within and across species. Moreover, simulation studies have shown that the intera cting effects of populati on structure and range expansion on Tajima's D are complex, and may obs cure its interpretation (Staedler et al. 2009). The overall idiosyncratic patterns of Tajim a's D instead reinforce the notion that 30pseudocongruence is driving the spatial patterns in our dataset, as a dive rsity of factors could affect population equilibrium in each species. However, the complex history underlying the population structure of the studied species, and the use of only one lo cus per species, suggest that these results should be treated tentatively. Alternative explanations . As each of the studied species is likely to have individual ecological tolerances, it is possible that al ternative refugia existed for each species in the Pleistocene, which could drive the individual patterns th at we have recorded. We observed B. alicastrum and F. insipida in riparian areas and galler y forests throughout our collecti on sites, suggesting that if rivers persisted during the Pleisto cene, smaller populations of thes e species may have survived in areas that were likely not included in refugial predictions. As models of paleoclimates have improved, predicting species' past distributions has become an in creasingly feasible and useful tool to explain phylogeographic patt erns (Richards et al. 2007; Wa ltari et al. 2007; Carnaval et al. 2009). While these methods make a variety of assumptions about past climates, and do not take into account local adaptation to changing environmental conditions - a common occurrence in contemporary plant populations - they still represent an altern ative to help explain species' responses to climate change. Analysis of each species' potential past distribution may reveal discrepancies from Brown's proposed refugia, an d potentially between sp ecies, and thus yield insights into observed spa tial patterns of chloroplast DNA in these species. Additionally, the species we chose are broadly distributed, and occur in seasonally moist and dry forests. It is conceivable that these spec ies were not as limited in their distribution during Pleistocene glacial cycles as obligate wet-forest species would have been, and either did not change their distribution, or experienced smalle r and more localized ra nge contractions. While previous climate models predicted the expansi on of grasslands in Ce ntral and South America 31during the Pleistocene (Haffer 1969), other auth ors have argued that conditions were moist enough to support dry forest, such that this ve getation type actually expanded during the Pleistocene while wet forest cont racted (Pennington et al. 2000; Cowling et al. 2001; Mayle et al. 2004). The latter possibility suggests that mechan isms other than climate change would have driven population divergen ce in the Pleistocene. We did not sample from the entire distri bution of these species. As long distance dispersal and gene flow is not an inconceivable possibility for tropical trees (Hamrick and Godt 1989; Dick et al. 2003; Jones et al. 2005), some of the variation we observed could have been due to dispersal from other, unsampled populat ions throughout the speci es' ranges. While we believe this is not the case for B. simaruba (MFP unpublished data), it is certainly possible that seeds of the other two species dispersed from ot her parts of their range in South America or Mexico. This may be an intriguing possibility for B. alicastrum and F. insipida , where many haplotypes in the networks were unsampled (Figure 2.2b, c). Divergence times measured between groups would then not reflec t processes that occurred in situ. Did common historical events drive population differentiatio n in Central American trees? Our results are ambiguous as to the origin of gene tic differentiation in these tree species. To unequivocally state that Pleistocene glacial cycles forced range contraction across species, spatial, temporal and demographic patterns would need to fit our expectations. Instead, these species show complex patterns that are likely a response to events in the Pleistocene. However, the exact nature of these events remains unclear , and there is some probability that population differentiation may have occurred earlier. Much of the phylogeographic l iterature on neotropical species points to pre-Pleistocene intr well et Glor et al. 2001; Dick et al. 2003); (but see Richardson et al. 2001; Dick et al. 2007). 32While our results tentatively point to Pleistocene processes in generating population divergence, we stress that our results are not necessarily in conflict with previ ous findings in other species. Our TMRCA estimates encompass both a Pleistocen e and Pliocene origin for the diversity found in each species- therefore, while we cannot conclude how early the diversity was formed, it is possible that processes that occu rred during the Pleistocene shaped diversity in populations that had already been present for a long time. Agai n, our study focused necessarily on chloroplast DNA divergence, with information from a nucl ear locus only for one species, and adding multiple nuclear loci would greatly improve our estimates of population splitting time. The role of Pleistocene glacial cycles in the population divergence of Cent ral American tr ees, while still intriguing, needs more evidence from further loci , as well as external information based on climate reconstructions and speci es' individual ecologica l tolerances, to be fully substantiated. 33 Figure 2.1. a) Reconstruction of the Pliocene land bridge at 3 Ma, redrawn from Coates and Obando (1996); b) Reconstruction of Pleistocene refugia, redrawn from Brown (1987); and c) an overlay of both processes.

F., and J. L. Hamrick. To be submitted to Journal of Biogeography . 44ABSTRACT The Pleistocene distribution and ex tent of Central American forest s, both wet and seasonally dry, is still unclear. We combine evidence from ecological niche modeling and phylogeographic studies of several tree species to test hypotheses of forest exte nt in Central America during the last glacial maximum (LGM). Using recently developed global simulations of Pleistocene climate, ecological niche modeling techniques, and species' occurrence data, we generate paleodistribution models of three 'focal' tree speci es that occur in wet and seasonally dry Central American forests, where recent phylogeogra phic results revealed strong Pleistocene differentiation that spatially coincided with prev iously proposed Central American refugia. We contrast these results with predictions from wet- and seasonally dry- forest obligate plant species. Our niche modeling results suggest that many species' distributions , regardless of forest type, should not have been restricted into proposed refugia during the LGM. While constrained from higher elevations, most species found suitable ha bitat on newly exposed la nd due to lowered sea levels during the LGM. We discuss the implicat ions of these findings for the three focal tree species, and for future phylogeographic st udies in this biodiverse region. 3.1 INTRODUCTION The effect of Pleistocene climate change on biol ogical diversification in neotropical forests has been debated for decades (e.g. Haffer 1969; Pr ance 1982; Colinvaux et al. 2000; Cowling et al. 2001; Ma yle 2004). To explain the high levels of species diversity observed in tropical forests, Haffer (1969) proposed that drye r and cooler climates during Pleistocene glacial cycles fragmented what ar e now continuous forests, leading to genetic divergence of allopatric populations of forest organisms, and, u ltimately, speciation (the \"refuge theory\"). While it is generally undisputed that cooler and dryer conditio ns prevailed during the 45Pleistocene (2.5 million - 10,000 years ago), it is still unclear whet her climate change was strong enough to result in disjunct forests, a precondi tion of allopatric neot ropical paleoclimate and vegetation have focused on South America, yet the northern extent of the neot ropics- Central America- has remained largely unexplored. Here, we use newly developed pale oclimate data and ecological niche modeling methods, in conjunction with phylogeographic data (Poelchau and Hamrick, in prep) and independent refugial predicti ons (Brown 1987), to ask whether Pleistocene glacial cycles impacted the distribution and population c onnectivity of Central American trees. There are several reasons why the neotropical Pleistocene refugial debate is still unresolved. Foremost, dated fossil pollen and ge ological information from sediment records ranging to the last glacial maximum, the last maximum expanse of glacial ice sheets roughly 21,000 years before present (LGM), are essential to unambiguously define the distribution of forest types in past climates. However, sedime nt records are sparse in the neotropics, and particularly in Central America. Lake cores from northeastern Guatemala, which currently harbors mesic forest, suggest that climate conditi ons were drier, and 6.5-8 \u00baC colder, than at present (Leyden 1984). Fossil pollen and plants discovered in lowland Caribbean Costa Rica suggest that Pleistocene forests in this area were not dryer, but cooler, than their modern counterparts (Horn et al. 2003). Pollen cores from higher eleva tions in Costa Rica indicate temperatures that were 4-8 \u00baC colder than today, and that montane taxa moved to lower elevations during the LGM (Hooghiemstra et al. 1992; Horn 1993; Islebe and Hooghiemstra 1997), restricting lowland forest vegetation further towards the coasts. Finally, Panamanian highland records suggest a cooling of 4 \u00baC, and that what are now cla ssified as lowland or montane forest species intermingled at lower elevations (Bush and Co linvaux 1990; Bush et al. 461992). In sum, fossil data suggest that humid forests may have spread coastward, generating species assemblages that differ from those known at present, while changes in moisture patterns may have varied by location thr oughout Central America. This ma kes it difficult to infer general distributional patterns of Pleistocene forest fr om sediment records. More recently, improved reconstructions of global and neotropical paleoclimate and vegetation during the LGM have been simulated. Results from these simulations suggest that reduction of rainforests in the Amazon basin was not as extensive as was previously suggested (Cowling et al. 2001; Mayle 2004). Global paleoclimate reconstruc tions actually document an overall increase in forest cove r in the tropics at a global scal e, relative to its present size (Harrison and Prentice 2003). Resu lts from these studies would s uggest that refugial hypotheses do not hold for the Amazon basin. The extent and di stribution of specifically Central American vegetation at the LGM, however, ha s not been studied in detail. Phylogeographic studies contri bute an additional method to determine the location and extent of Pleistocene refugia (Avise 2000; Soltis et al. 2006; 2007). Phylogeography places the relationships of intraspeci fic genetic information in a spatial context, and can thus help infer processes that led to genetic divergence among populations, and ultimately speciation (Avise 2000). Previous phyloge ographic studies of forest animals in South America are inconclusive regarding the distributi on, or even existence, of Pleistocene refugia (Lessa et al. 2003; but see Bonaccorso et al. 2006). Studies that have dated divergence times of neotropical populations and species show mixed results, with ev idence for both Pleistocene and pre-Pleistocene divergence (Morit z al. 2000; Richardson al . 2001; Crawford 2003; 2008; Peterson and Nyari 2008). Phyloge ographic studies of plant species in Central America are scarce, given the logistic barriers of sampling in the tropics, and the technical 47difficulties of finding genetic markers with sufficient variation in many plant species (Schaal et al. 1998). Strong genetic structure among populations has been detected in the majority of these few studies, and does not always coincide with obvi ous physical barriers to gene flow (Chase et al. 1995; Aide and Rivera 1998; Cave rs et al. 2003a; Dick et al. 2003; Novick et al. 2003). This suggests that historical factors- whether they occurred in the Pl eistocene or earlier- had a strong influence on population diverg ence in this region. Ecological niche modeling is emerging as a promising method to generate mechanistic explanations for phylogeographic patterns, and has been used successfully to confirm the Pleistocene origin of species and population di vergence in some neotropical species (Bonaccorso et al. 2006; Carnaval and Moritz 2008; Peterson and Nyari 2008). The main assumption is that a species' distribution - its realized niche - can be estimated from a suite of environmental variables- usually temperature, rainfall, and their seasonal varia tion (Phillips et al. 2006). Geo- referenced species occurrence records are associ ated with environmental data, which in turn results in a spatially explicit model of the spec ies' 'ecological niche'. This model can then be projected onto other climate conditions - either other parts of the globe, for example for an invasive species, or to past or future conditions, if data on past and future climatic conditions are available. This generates an approximation of the past or future distribution of suitable habitat for a species, assuming that the species' enviro nmental tolerances have remained constant. Several methods that only require presence data - absence records are ge nerally not attainable for the range of most species - have been develo ped in recent years, and are gaining widespread use in ecological and phylogeograp hic studies (Stockwell and Pete rs 1999; Hijmans et al. 2005b; Phillips et al. 2006). In tandem, fine-scale simulati ons of global temperature and precipitation at the LGM have become publicly available (Br aconnot et al. 2007). The combination of these 48resources has allowed biogeographers to generate models of species' dist ributions at the LGM, and to compare these with phylogeographic and fo ssil data, when available (Bonaccorso et al. 2006; Carnaval and 2008; Peterson and Ny ari 2008; Waltari and Guralnick 2009). While this method is not without caveats (Anderson et al. 2003; Elith and Gr aham 2009), many studies have verified its utility with independent fo ssil and phylogeographic data. Hence, while these methods certainly do not replace the need for fo ssil and geological data, they still produce species-specific informati on on past distributions. Several authors have used an integrative appr oach to estimate the location of neotropical Pleistocene refugia. While most authors fo cused on South America, Brown (1987) proposed refugial locations for humid forest taxa in both South and Central America, based on paleoclimatic, geological, and soil data, as we ll as vegetation patterns (Figure 3.1). Some phylogeographic studies of lowland forest trees in Central Amer ica have recovered population structure that seemingly coincide s with Brown's refugia (Cavers et al. 2003b; Dick et al. 2003); however, these studies were not designed to explicitly test the location of these refugia, and thus do not provide conclusive evidence of the role of Pleistocene climat e change in population divergence. A recent phylogeographic study of three to distinguis h between Brown's Pleistocene ref ugia vs. earlier, or Pliocene, divergence (Poelchau and Hamrick, in pr ep) found evidence for significant genetic differentiation between regions where Brown's refugia are located (Figure 3.2). Divergence between these regions dated to the Pleistocene in two of the species, whereas the third had insufficient information to date population diverg ence. This result was somewhat unexpected, as these three tree species were known to grow in both wet and seasonally dry forest, and should 49therefore have been less sensitiv e to dryer Pleistocene conditions, and less likely to retreat into refugia. However, if Pleistocene climate ch ange was the driving mechanism behind population divergence in these species, these phylogeographic data suggest that Pleistocene climates in Central America were more limiting for tree species than South American studies would suggest. Therefore, it is important to discern whether these species' ranges were restricted during the Pleistocene. Additionally, because these three tree species thrive in both wet and seasonally dry forests, determining Pleistocene distributions of wet or seasonally dry forest obligate species would ascertain the generality of forest re striction at the LGM in Central America. We have two objectives for this paper: first, to determine whether genetic differentiation found for these three Central American tree sp ecies can be explained by past climate using ecological niche models (ENMs). Our second goal is to discern whether modeled range restrictions and shifts occurred for obligate we t or seasonally dry forest species, for which Pleistocene refugial hypotheses are more clea rly defined. Specifically, we first ask whether modeled range sizes were smaller during the LG M in Central America, and whether modeled LGM and present distributions overlap. Then, we test whether modeled LGM distributions correlate with Brown's proposed Central Amer ican refugia. We focus on Central America because of the phylogeographic data that we have recently collected, and because of the need for studies focused on paleodistr ibutions in this area. 3.2 METHODS Species selection. For each of the three focal species, we compiled georeferenced occurrence records from our own collections and from the online database TROPICOS (http://www.tropicos.org/ , maintained by the Missouri Botanical Garden), which has extensive global occurrence records for plant species. Lo w accuracy of species' occurrence points can 50diminish the quality of the resulting ecological niche model (Graham et al. 2008). Therefore, we discarded records with less than 1 km accuracy, and records were visually checked for obvious errors (i.e. in ocean or above treeline). For neotropical wet and seasonally dry forest comparisons, we selected species with documented occurrence records exclusively from wet or seasonally dry forest habitat (Croat 1978; Janzen 1983). We searched TROPICOS for occu rrence records for this list of species, and used the same protocol to maintain accuracy. A fina l list of seven wet forest (two of which have phylogeographic/population ge netic information: Poulsenia armata (Aide and (Clusiaceae, Dick et al. 2003; Dick and Heuertz 2008) and seven seasonally dry forest species with more than 70 unique occurrence records per species were chosen for Central American wet and seasonally dry forest distribution modeling (Table 3.1). Environmental layers. For present ENMs, we used a set of 19 bioclimatic layers developed from world-wide temperature and rainfall data, as well as an altitudina l layer, at 2.5' resolution from the WorldClim v. 1.4 dataset (Hijmans et al. 2005a). Bioclimatic layers repr esent climatic trends, extremes, or seasonality, which may be more lim iting for organismal distributions than raw temperature or rainfall data, and have been suc cessfully used to model ecological niches (e.g. Waltari et al. 2007; Carnaval a nd and Guralnick 2009). Corresponding paleoclimate layers from the LGM were developed by R. Hijmans. The development of these layers has been describe d elsewhere (Peterson and Nyari 2008). Briefly, paleoclimate layers were developed from general circulation model (GCM) simulations from two models, the Community Climate System Mode l (CCSM, http://www.ccsm.ucar.edu/,Kiehl and Gent 2004) and the Model for Interdisciplinar y Research on Climate (MIROC, ver. 3.2; http://www.ccsr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ and Emori 2004). resolution from the PM IP2 website (http://www.pmip2.cnrs-gif.fr/; Braconnot et al. 2007), were calibrated by subtr action from modern climate layers, and were resampled to 2.5' resolution via bilinear interpolation. Analogous calculations of bioclimatic variables were then performed on these high- resolution paleoclimate layers. We cropped both present and paleoclimate layers to cover the entire ra nge of the chosen species (27\u00baN - 22\u00baS, 109 - 56\u00baW). All ecological niche models and their pr ojections onto past clim ate conditions were run using this geographic extent, in order to encomp ass the range of envir onmental conditions to which they are exposed. While we checked results for reliability across th e entire modeled range, subsequent analyses of model re sults were conducted in Central American forests only (17 - 6. 75\u00baN, 95 - 77\u00baW, see below), for comparison wi th our phylogeographic data (see Waltari and Guralnick 2009 for a similar example). Niche model construction. Recent reviews have evaluated the relative performance of the two most widely used ENM algorithms, Maxent (Phi llips et al. 2006) and Desktop-Garp (Stockwell and Peters 1999). Both algorithms have been us ed to successfully model and project species' distributions under various conditions (Pearson et al. 2007; Wisz et al. 2008), while using different approaches to arrive at their results : Garp uses a genetic algorithm, and Maxent a maximum entropy approach. Many evaluations show that Maxent outperforms Garp, in terms of the receiver-operating characteristic s (ROC), but may risk overfitting the model, thus resulting in a too narrow distribution (Elith et al. 2006; Peterson et al. 200 7; Wisz et al. 2008; Elith and Graham 2009). In turn, Desktop-Garp successfully retrieves a species' potential distribution, but at the expense of a high commission error, wh ere too broad an area is predicted suitable (Peterson et al. 2007). To addre ss these concerns, we adopted th e following approach: we used both Desktop-Garp (following the evaluation appr oach of Anderson et al . 2003) and Maxent to 52construct and project each species ' distribution. Because evaluations of our models from both algorithms revealed similar results, we opted to report model output only from Maxent, because of the overall higher model performance found in reviews, the high perf ormance (in terms of AUC values) observed in our own results, and be cause the different algorithms used for each approach make a meaningful integration of the Maxent and Desktop- Garp output somewhat difficult or arbitrary. Maxent (maximum entropy modeling) is a machine learning tec hnique that enables spatial modeling of presence-only data (Phillip s et al. 2006). Thus, it is useful for modeling species distributions from occurrence records, which usually lack abse nce data. Using species occurrence records, current, and past environmen tal data, it generates ecological niche models which can be projected onto past climate conditions, allowing an estimation of an area's past habitat suitability for a species. In Maxent v. 3.3.1 (Phillips et al. 2006), we used the default convergence threshold (10-5), increased the number of iterati ons to 1000, and randomly selected 25% of each species' records for model testi ng. We had the program generate cumulative suitability scores, which range from 0 to 100, and indicate the species' predicted suitability for a given pixel in space ( not the probability of occurrence). We used receiver operating curve analysis to determine model quality (Anderson et al. 2003). All ENMs were conducted on the full range of each species, as modeling the niche across a larger area is likely to encompass a larger extent of the f undamental niche of a species, and will thus result in a preferable model (Phillips et al. 2006). However, we focus our evaluation on Central America, which is the focal range of the phylogeographic study. We masked the major Nicaraguan lakes (Lakes Nicaragua and Managua), and assumed that lake levels at the LGM were similar to present levels (Villa 1976; Barluenga and Meye r 2004). We did not mask glaciers 53at the LGM, as their exact boundaries are still de bated (Lachniet and Seltzer 2002). To generate a single, composite prediction from both LGM climat e simulations, we averaged predictions from the CCSM and MIROC model outputs (following Bonaccorso et al. 2006; Waltari and Guralnick 2009). When subsequent calculations of the ENM are required, it is often useful to convert continuous output into presence/a bsence predictions by choosing a \"cutoff\", or threshold value. There has been much debate on th e appropriate threshold (Cantor et al. 1999; Manel et al. 2001; Liu et al. 2005). To address concerns of mode l over-fitting, we chose two thresholds for model evaluation. As a more restrictive threshold, we us ed the equal training se nsitivity and specificity threshold (ETSS threshold), which gives reliab le model output (Liu et al. 2005). Additionally, we used the cumulative output value of 10 as a threshold (C10), which resulted in much lower omission rates across species (Tab le 3.1), and in a broader predic ted area. Applying thresholds resulted in binary species-specific maps, where presence-predicted areas had a value of one, and absence-predicted areas a value of 0. To generate composite predictions of wet forest and seasonally dry forest species' di stributions during the LGM, we su mmed all of the distributions for each threshold for the species from each fo rest type in DIVA-GI S (Hijmans et al. 2005b). This resulted in eight maps of seasonally dr y and wet forest habitat for present and LGM conditions, with values ranging fr om 0 (no species predicted pr esent) to seven (all species predicted present). To define the maximum extent of wet or seasonally dry forest, we used the area where at least one species is predicted pres ent, and used this area for subsequent area and overlap calculations. We used DIVA-GIS (Hijmans et al. 2005b) to calculate the area predicted for each species at present and the LGM. We also used this program to calculate overlap between present 54and LGM predicted distributions, and so to dete rmine whether species' ranges had shifted since the LGM. Following equations 1) and 2) in Hijm ans and Graham (2006), we calculate an overlap index (OI), as well as the relative range size (RRS ) for each temporal pair, which corrects for the bias that arises when comparing RRS between pairs where LGM area > present vs. present area > LGM. The RRS statistic measures whether the area of species' ranges has changed since the LGM; an increase in area since the LGM is represented by a negative value, and an areal decrease is represented by a positive value. We did not correct for the increase in land at the LGM due to lower sea levels. Our primary intere st is whether species' ranges were smaller during the Pleistocene, which should have a st rong effect on their phyl ogeographic patterns. However, a study interested in suitable habitat re lative to total availabl e land should correct for differences in land area between present and LGM conditions. Brown's refugia/ St atistical analyses. One of our goals was to ask whether species' LGM distributions overlapped with Br own's (1987) refugial predictions for Central America. Similar to Waltari et al. (2007), we created polygons of refugi al locations in DIVA-GIS based on Brown's descriptions, which we converted to geor eferenced grid files. Spatial autocorrelation is a known statistical problem when measuring the correlation between variables. When variables are spatially autocorrelated, de grees of freedom are overestimat ed, which leads to a spurious narrowing of confidence intervals (Clifford et al. 1989; Dutilleul et al. 1993) . To account for this, we used Dutilleul's test, as implemented in the program Spatial Analysis in Macroecology (SAM, Rangel et al. 2006), to test whether LGM species distributions ge nerated by Maxent, or estimates of the distribution of LGM seasonally dry or wet forest, matched Brown's refugial predictions. It was necessary to re duce file size for the calculations to be completed; therefore, we aggregated model output by a fa ctor of five, and generated a data file with longitude, latitude, 55and species presence or absence for models of the focal species, individual wet and seasonally dry forest species, composite wet and seasonall y dry forest, as well as Brown's refugial predictions. 3.3 RESULTS Focal species. Contrary to Brown's refugial hypotheses, as well as our phylogeographic data, the focal species' modeled distributi ons during the LGM were neither restricted nor interrupted for either threshold (Figure 3.3, Ta ble 3.1). There was strong overl ap between pr esent and LGM distributions (OI ranged from 52 to 95%, Table 3.1). Relative range sizes and the distribution and extent of each species varied with the threshol d. Using the ETSS threshold, relative range sizes showed some heterogeneity: wh ile the distri bution of both B. simaruba and B. alicastrum has decreased since the LGM, F. insipida showed an increase in range size (Table 3.1). However, for all species, distributions at the LGM were shifted coastward, away from higher-elev ation areas in the Chortis Block (Nicaragua) a nd the Costa Rican Cordilleras, and filling the receding coastal areas which were exposed during the LGM (Figur e 3.3). Under the more liberal C10 threshold, RRS values were similar across species, all show ing range contractions since the LGM (Table 3.1). In turn, trends towards coastal range shifts were much weaker (Figure 3.3). Wet and seasonally dry forests. Similarly, there was strong ov erlap in present and LGM distributions for both wet and seasonally dry forest species, as well as their composite predictions, under both thresholds (Table 3.1, Figure 3.4). Overla p ranged from 50% to 99% for wet forest species, and from 34% to 100% for seas onally dry forest species. Relative range sizes also varied, although for the ETSS threshold, dist ributions were on aver age larger during the LGM for seasonally dry forest than wet forest species. Under the ETSS threshold, only one of the seasonally dry forest species, Trichilia hirta , increased in range size since the LGM based on 56the Maxent results, whereas three of eight wet fo rest species had predicted range size increases (Table 3.1). This trend disappear ed under the C10 threshold, indica ting that relative range size is not robust across thresholds. Model quality. Model quality produced by Maxent was high: the results of the receiver operating curve analysis, as measured by the area under the curve statistic (AUC), ranged from 0.91 to 0.99 (Table 3.1), compared to the expected value of 0.5 if the prediction were random (p < 0.0001 for all models). The cumulative threshold where tr aining sensitivity and sp ecificity were equal (ETSS threshold) ranged from 19 to 37.5. Tr aining omission rates ra nged between 3.7% and 15.9% for the ETSS threshold, and between 0 and 5.3% for the C10 threshold. Comparison with refugial predictions. None of the tested correlations between present and LGM modeled distributions for the focal species were significant after correcting for spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that Brown's refugial predictions do not hold for these species (Table 3.2). Under the C10 threshold, the composite wet forest LGM prediction was significantly correlated with Brown's refugia. Additionall y, when treated individually, many wet forest species showed significant posi tive correlations under either or both thresholds. While only one of the seasonally dry forest species had a significant ne gative correlation ( Pithecellobium dulce, C10 threshold, p = 0.039), most of the correlatio n coefficients for dry forest species were negative, and some of them al most significant (Table 3.2). 3.4 DISCUSSION Ecological niche modeling and phylogeographic anal yses have emerged as complementary tools to inform biogeographic hypotheses, and confirm biogeographic patterns (Richards et al. al. et al. 2009). In particular, paleodistribution m odeling can generate spatially explicit hypotheses about species' 57distributions up to the LGM, which can be comp ared to independent phy logeographic data. This can be particularly useful in determining mechanisms of Pl eistocene population divergence in tropical systems, where patterns of climate change at the LGM are less clear-cut than in the temperate zone, and where fossil records are sparse. We applied ecological niche modeling methods to estimate the paleodistribution of three neotropical tree species exhibiti ng concordant phylogeographic di fferentiation, two of which are of confirmed Pleistocen e origin. Our goal was to determine whether modeled paleodistributions of these species corroborated divergence due to Pleistocene climate change, or whether mechanisms other than climate change may have in fluenced these species' past distributions and biogeographic histories. Furtherm ore, we tested whether indepe ndent refugial predictions for Central American forest taxa (Brown 1987) were restricted to only wet-forest obligate taxa, or whether seasonally dry-forest obligate of Pleist ocene restriction into Brown's refugia, as well. Overall, we found that the modeled distributi ons of the three focal taxa at the LGM were continuous along the Pacific coast of Central Am erica, contrasting w ith the strong genetic differentiation we found previously (Figures 3.2, 3.3). This result does not support the hypothesis that these species retreated into refugia dur ing Pleistocene glacial cycles. Under the less permissive ETSS threshold, pa leodistributions of both B. alicastrum (Figure 3.3d) and F. insipida (Figure 3.3f) were slightly interrupted in No rthwestern Nicaragua, and in Southwestern Nicaragua for F. insipida only; however, corridors of suitable habitat still persisted, suggesting that gene flow still could have occurred througho ut western Nicaragua. While species' current and LGM distributions overlapped (OI ranged between 0.52 and 0.95, Table 3.1), their distributions expanded coastward during the LG M, and vacated montane habitats under the 58ETSS threshold (most likely due to limiting temp erature and moisture co nditions in mountainous areas). This suggests that distri butions could have been interrupted by the Chortis highlands in Nicaragua, and were certainly inte rrupted by mountain ranges in Costa Rica and Panama, as they are today. Interestingly, under the ETSS threshold, al l species' distributions were interrupted in Panama, where we found no evidence for ge netic divergence. There was no support for coincidence between Brown's refugia and the fo cal species' LGM distributions, which suggests that either Brown's refugial predictions are inaccu rate, or that they only pertain to wet forest obligate taxa. To address this question, we generated pale odistribution models for seven representative wet forest plant taxa, which we then summarized to generate an overall model for wet forest distribution at the LGM (Figure 3.4 b, d). The wet forest model and Brown's refugia were only significantly correlated after co rrection for spatial autocorrela tion under the C10 threshold, and almost significant under the ETSS threshol d (C10: p = 0.045, ETSS: p = 0.062, Table 3.2). Concomitantly, we found an 88% - 99% overl ap between current and LGM wet forest distributions (Table 3.1, Pear son's r (ETSS/C10) = 0.503/0.486, corrected p < 0.001), and an overall decrease in wet forest area since the LGM, although responses of individual species varied (Table 3.1). These results suggest that on the whole, while Brown's refugia were important habitats for wet forest species dur ing the LGM, wet forest distribution was not necessarily more restricted than it is at present. A closer inspection of each we t forest species' response to climate change reveals that many species' distributions correla ted significantly with Brown's re fugia (Table 3.2). Under the ETSS threshold, three of these species had a c oncomitant increase in ra nge size since Miconia affinis, of the refugial 59hypothesis. While all of these species were pr edicted to occur on th e Caribbean coast of Nicaragua - an area not predicted as a refugium by Brown - their distributions in northern Honduras during the LGM were restricted (Appendix 3.2). Unfortunately, no phylogeographic studies of these species in northern Honduras have been conducted to verify whether there are signatures of previously disjunct distribut ions. A previous phylogeographic study of P. armata proposed refugia in riparian zones along the Cari bbean coast of Central America based on higher levels of genetic diversity in this region (Aide and Rivera 1998); however, P. armata has no occurrence records in Honduras and Nicaragua, even though niche models predict its present occurrence sporadically throughout this region (Appendix 3.1). A. gracile and M. affinis are the only chosen species that are not trees - A. gracile is epiphytic, and M. affinis is an understory shrub, so it is possible that thei r life histories contributed to the different distribut ional patterns during the LGM. It is worth noting that Symphonia globulifera showed no evidence of a restricted distribution du ring the Pleistocene. This is consis tent with the st rong, idiosyncratic population genetic structure found in this spec ies in Central America from phylogeographic studies (Dick et al. 2003; Dick and Heuertz 2008). Overall, it appears that restriction of wet forest species during the LGM was heterogeneous. Patterns that we find are consis tent with the fossil po llen record - our focal species' distributions shifted towards the lowl ands, which aligns with records of Param\u00f3 vegetation at lower altitudes dur ing the Pleistocene in Costa Rica (reviewed in Islebe and Hooghiemstra 1997). In addition, wet forest specie s were predicted present in the Costa Rican Caribbean lowlands during the LGM, corroborati ng findings of fossil pollen and wood (Horn et al. 2003). 60Given our results from the three focal taxa a nd the wet forest species , it is not surprising that neither the composite seasonally dry forest distribution, nor the i ndividual seasonally dry forest species, showed any ev idence of Pleistocene range cont raction (Table 3.1). Only one seasonally dry forest species, Trichilia hirta (Meliaceae), showed evidence of range expansion in Central America since the LGM under the ETSS thre shold; but this pattern did not hold under the C10 threshold (Table 3.1). Additionally, as this species' LGM distribution showed no correlation with Brown's refugia (Table 3.2), it is likely that mechanisms other than limiting temperatures or rainfall contributed to this species' Pleistocene ra nge limitation. In addition, many species had a negative association between their LGM distribution and Brown's refugia, only one of which was significant. Indeed, results from the seasonally dry forest species appear to corroborate previous hypothe ses that seasonally dry fore st vegetation, and not savanna, expanded during dryer and riods (Pennington et al . 2000; Pennington et al. 2004). The expansion of seasonally dry forest dur ing the LGM is mediated mostly by suitable conditions on land exposed by lower sea levels (F igure 3.4 f, h), and appeared to have been continuous along the Pacific co ast of Central America. We chose to use two thresholds to convert the cumulative Maxent output into binary predictions; the equal trai ning sensitivity and specificity thre shold, which uses a higher threshold and thus results in a smaller pr edicted distribution, and the C10 threshold, which results in a larger predicted distribution. We chose the former threshold as it has been used successfully to predict species' distributions (Liu et al . 2005), and because other studies comparing phylogeographic predictions with ENM reconstructions suggest th at higher thresholds might more accurately reflect phylogeographic refugial predictions (Waltari et al. 2007). We used the lower, C10 threshold to assuage concerns that higher thresholds in Maxent may result in model 61over-fitting, leading to false ne gative predictions when proj ecting the mode l into unknown climate conditions (Peterson et al. 2007). Howeve r, our results suggest that the C10 results should be treated with caution. The LGM predicti ons at the lower C10 threshold suggest that many of the modeled species, which currently only grow in at a site where sediment cores documented montane forest during and after the LGM (Bush et al. 1992), wher eas the higher ETSS threshold predicts fewer species at this site rely contradictory- Bush ( 1992) also found pollen from a limited number of lowland taxa in his cores. We suggest that results from the higher ETSS threshold are more realistic, as they corrobor ate the lower abundance of lowland vegetation found from pollen cores at this site. The less stringent C10 threshold may overestimate species' LGM distributions. However, our main conclusion- that the distribution of the focal species was not interrupted during the LGM- is consistent with predictions from both thresholds. Pleistocene divergence found in our three focal species st ill remains unexplained. There are a number of reasons why populat ion divergence could have occurred in the Pleistocene, yet remain undetected by climate-based niche rec onstructions. A major a ssumption of paleoniche reconstructions is that local adaptation has not occurred in organisms between the modeled time periods. This assumption is unr ealistic: local adaptation is common in plant populations, and response to locally differing selection pressures of ten occurs swiftly (e.g. post-glacial adaptations of temperate trees to and Gr ant 1996; Savolainen et al. 2007). Local adaptation of these plant species to dr yer conditions could have occurred during the 62Pleistocene, unifying previous ly disjunct populations. Second, plants could have colonized Central America after the Pleistocene. The Central American landbridge has only been closed for the past 3 million years (Coates and Oba ndo 1996), and dispersal limitation could have prevented species from colonizing the landbridge until well after its closure. Thus, clades could have diverged in South American or Mexican populations during the Pleistocene, and prior to colonization of Central America. An intriguing combination of colonization and local adaptation has been proposed by Cavers et al. (2003b), who found similar patterns of population structure in the generalist tree species Cedrela odorata . They suggest that dry- and wet- adapted South American ecotypes may have colonized analogous ha bitats in Central America, maintaining both neutral and quantitative genetic va riation that evolved in South Am erica. While it is possible that a similar process may have led to the phylogeogra phic patterns found in our studied taxa, it is not likely that the same process led to similar patte rns of genetic variation across several unrelated taxa with different biogeographi c histories. Third, we were restricted to modeling habitat suitability during the LGM- even though five glacial cycles occurred during the Pleistocene. It is possible that previous cycles may have had a stro nger influence on species' distributions than the LGM; or that the combined effect of repeated cycles had an additional influence on habitat suitability in this region. Fi nally, we only took climatic conditions into account when constructing ecological niche models; it is po ssible that these species' distributions are additionally constrained by othe r abiotic factors, such as soil composition, or by biotic interactions. An earlier study comparing modeled pa leodistributions to ref ugial predictions based on phylogeography similarly found fewer refugia than the genetic data would suggest (Waltari et al. 2007), indicating that ecological niche modeling may overestimate species' past distributions, 63as it is difficult to incorporate all of the factor s that limit species' distributions into a single model. Where do these results leave the Pleistocene refugial debate for Central American taxa? Our results suggest that individua l species' responses to climate change in the Pleistocene varied. However, even species with the most restricted Pl eistocene distributions did not fare as poorly as Brown (1987) surmised; all species were predicte d to occur in Caribbean Nicaragua, and thus had a more continuous distribut ion along the Caribbean coast th an previously thought. Thus, some idiosyncratic patterns of genetic variation found across Cent ral American taxa may result from individualistic responses to climate change, as well as independent co lonization histories of the geologically recent landbridge. Our results sugge st that lowland forest species' ranges shifted from higher ground during the LGM, suggesting th at montane vegetation may have expanded or retreated to lower elevations. This is corrobor ated by sediment record s (Horn 1993; Islebe and Hooghiemstra 1997). As an alternative appro ach, phylogeographic studies on montane taxa could ask whether these species' ranges had contr acted since the Pleistocene; this would be a useful confirmation of the obs ervation that many modeled lowl and species shifted to lower elevations during the LGM. 64 Figure 3.1.

F., and J. L. Hamrick. To be submitted to Molecular Ecology . 71ABSTRACT Landscape genetics uses spatially explicit popul ation genetic information to determine the physical causes of genetic structure on regional scales. The identificati on of barriers to gene flow, in particular across multiple, co-distrib uted species, is important for understanding the evolutionary trajectories of popul ations, as well as for habitat conservation. Here, we use a comparative landscape genetic approach to te st whether elevation-mediated temperature differences drive genetic differentiation in thre e lowland Central American tree species. While two of the three tree sp ecies support this prediction, the pattern is confounded by historical associations in one species, s uggesting that temperature does not have as strong of a role in mediating gene flow as previously assumed. This result underscores the importance of a historical framework when attempting to identif y current landscape barriers to gene flow. Our study explicitly confirms suggestions from previous studies of Central Ameri can tree species that imply that the interaction of both historical a nd current barriers to gene flow determines population genetic structure of trees in this region. 4.1 INTRODUCTION Understanding how landscape features affect ge netic connectivity in natural populations is fundamental to our knowledge of the evoluti onary trajectory of populations, how populations diverge, and eventually speciate (Manel et al. 2003; St orfer et al. 2007). Knowledge of landscape features that affect genetic divergence acro ss multiple species can help to identify common drivers of population structur e across communities, an impor tant goal in evolutionary, Martin 1998; Avise 2005). Studies of gene fl ow and dispersal across species w ithin the same landscape can also be useful in habitat conserva tion, to determine whether species can be managed jointly, or 72whether species need individual treatment (Rouget et al. 2006). Co mparative landscape genetics studies are rare, however, so th e effect of common landscape feat ures on gene flow patterns is not known for many communities (Fortuna et al. 2009) . Here, we test whether three factors that should affect gene flow in Central American tree species - elevation-mediated temperature change, aquatic dispersal barriers, and geographi c distance - have common effects on patterns of genetic structure in three common, co-distributed tree species. We place our results in the context of a previous study, which identified historical barriers to gene flow. The Central American landscape is dominate d by several north to south oriented mountain ranges (Figure 4.1), which may presen t strong barriers to gene flow for many organisms. In particular, temperat ure change, as mediated by eleva tion change, is suggested to be particularly important in limiting the distribut ion of tropical organisms, as more drastic physiological changes may be needed to adapt to colder temperatures th an in their temperate counterparts (Janzen 1967). While steep slopes per se may present a smalle r challenge to insect pollinators and avian seed dispersers than for organisms that must move by land, temperature changes associated with elevation change may produce a significant barrier to gene flow in lowland-adapted tree species. T hus, topographic relief, or the te mperature changes associated with it, is often invoked as a driver of diffe rentiation in Central Am erican forest species (Zamudio and Greene 1997; Aide and Rivera 1998; Savage 2002; Dick et al. 2003). However, the role of elevation or temperat ure change in the genetic differe ntiation of tropical tree species has never been formally tested, either in indi vidual species, or in a comparative fashion. In particular, variation in the physiological toleranc es of tree species, thei r pollinators, and their dispersers, may drive important differences in ge ne dispersal across purported barriers (Sork et al. 1999). 73Alternatively, landscape shape, or the extent of land not covered by ocean, may strongly influence patterns of gene flow in plants, espe cially in curvilinear habitats, where dispersal distances by land are longer rela tive to straight-line distances. Landscape shape has already been implicated as a driver of genetic dist ance in Central American populations of Swietenia macrophylla , a neotropical tree species (Novick et al. 2003; McRae and Beier 2007), and thus may be important for genetic differentiation in similar lowland tree species. Alternatively, species with different pollination and dispersal sy ndromes might have different relationships of landscape shape with genetic distance, as adaptations such as wind pollination or dispersal, or the ability to disperse seeds by water, may d ecrease the impact of landscape shape. Geographic distance is commonl y used to explain patterns of genetic distance. Under limited dispersal, genetic divergence at neutra l loci should increase wi th geographic distance, known as isolation by distance (Wright 1943) . This phenomenon has been documented extensively in natural systems since its inception, and is alr eady known to driv e patterns of genetic distance in many tropical tr ee species (Cardoso et al. 2000; Collevatti et al. 2001; Cavers et al. 2003c; Lemes et al. 2003; Novick et al. 200 3). Departures from an isolation by distance model have been used to test violations of migrat ion-drift equilibrium due to historical contingency (Hutchison and Templeton 1999; Tu rgeon and Bernatchez 20 01). Alternatively, it can be used as a 'geographic null model' agains t which to test the eff ect of other landscape features on patterns of genetic di fferentiation (McRae and Beier 2007). While current landscape features may drive pa tterns of gene flow, historical conditions can confound observed patterns of ge netic structure, and should be considered when evaluating gene flow barriers in natural populations (Tur geon and Bernatchez 2001; Lee-Yaw et al. 2009; Zellmer and Knowles 2009). In Central America, the recent uplift of the landbridge, culminating 743 million years ago (Coates and Obando 1996), a nd subsequent Pleistocene glacial cycles (Brown 1987) may have affected past patterns of genetic structure. This structure may persist if migration-drift equilibrium has not been r eached, which can take many generations when population sizes are large and migration rates lo w (Crow and Aoki 1984). Indeed, in a previous phylogeographic study of three widespread lowla nd tree species, we found spatially concordant genetic differentiation of chloroplast DNA in all species, suggesting a Pleistocene phylogeographic break (Poelchau and Hamrick, in prep). Other studies of population genetic structure in Central American tree species have found patterns that may have been driven by interactions between current and hi storical barriers to gene flow (Cavers et al. 2003a; Novick et al. 2003; McRae and Beier 2007; Dick and Heuert z 2008). Because patterns of nuclear genetic structure may still reflect historical barriers - although they are less likely to do so (Birky et al. 1989) - it is important to consider historical contingency when testing the effects of current barriers to gene flow on genetic differentia tion (Lee-Yaw et al. 2009; Zellmer and Knowles 2009). Here, we explore the effect of temperature, landscape shape, a nd Euclidian geographic distance on nuclear genetic differe ntiation in three widespread lo wland tree species in Central America. Because of strong, elevation-mediated temperature clines bisecting Costa Rica and parts of Panama, we expect lowland forest sp ecies to show evidence of temperature-driven genetic differentiation. We firs t describe population structure using exploratory methods. We then use causal modeling (Legendre and Trou ssellier 1988; Legendre 1993) to test whether population structure in each species is most cons istent with temperature, or instead by landscape shape or geographic distance. Finally, we determ ine potential historical associations in our genetic data, and discuss their implications. 754.2 to upper-canopy trees that range fr om Mexico to South America (Janzen 1983; Chase et al. 1995). These species we re chosen for this study based on their broad distribution, their co-occurrence in similar forest sites, and to reflect a diversity of pollination and fruit-dispersal modes. They thrive in bot h wet and dry lowland forests, but are more common in dry forests (MFP pers. obs.). B. simaruba is insect-pollinated and predominately bird-dispersed (Croat 1978). Th ere are reports of adaptations to both wind- (Berg 2001) and insect- (Croat 1978; Berg 1990) pollination in B. alicastrum. It is dispersed by a variety of mammals (birds, monkeys, bats, and seconda ry dispersal by rodents) (Croat 1978). Ficus insipida is wasp-pollinated (Machado et al. 2001) , grows both in secondary forest, as well as in riparian habitats, and is disper sed by monkeys, bats, and fish (C roat 1978; Banack et al. 2002). Population sampling . In June through October 2007, we collected leaf tissue from each of approximately 30 populations per species through out lower Central America, from western Panama, throughout Costa Rica, western Nicaragu a, and El Salvador (Figure 4.1). Tissue samples were dried and stored in silica gel. The majority of samples were collected from national parks, although some material was taken from roadsides or private properties (mainly B. simaruba , which is used as a \"living fen ce\" throughout Central America. While B. alicastrum seeds have been used by humans in the past, th ey do not recruit outside the forest; MP pers. obs.). Vouchers of each species have been deposited in herbaria of each country. Genetic data collection . We extracted DNA with a modified CTAB protocol (Doyle and Doyle 1990). To enhance DNA extract quality, we conduc ted an additional ethanol precipitation on F. insipida extracts; and used all B. simaruba DNA within 48 hours of extraction. Our AFLP 76methodology followed a modified protocol of Vos et al. (1995). We used three selective primer pairs for B. simaruba, four for B. alicastrum, and five for F. insipida (Appendix 4.1) . Fluorescently labeled PCR products were visualized on an ABI We defined loci manually within the GeneMarker program, ranging between 70 and 500 bp. We used a semi- automatic procedure to score loci: we had GeneMarker automatically call loci if fluorescence exceeded a certain threshold. Questionable peaks were scored manually, and all samples were visually inspected for scoring errors. Samples wi th poor profiles were discarded, and in some cases re-run. Variable sample quality in B. alicastrum required manual scoring of all samples. Repeatability estimates. We ran repeats of 8.3% of all sa mples for each species, beginning with the digestion step. Repeatabilit y was measured following Pompa non et al. (2005), as one minus the number of mismatched samples over all repeated samples, for each locus. Loci with less than 90% repeatability were discarded. The remaining loci were used to calculate the total error rate, which is the number of mismatched samples, di vided by the total number of repeated samples. Error rates for B. simaruba, B. alicastrum, and F. insipida were 2.77%, 4.76%, and 3.36%, respectively, which is within the reported range for most plant species (Bonin et al. 2004). Detecting population structure. We used GenAlEx (Peakall and Smouse 2006) to calculate the % of polymorphic loci, for each population and spec ies. In addition, we calculated the Shannon- Weaver diversity index following Abbott et al. (2007), for each population and species. To estimate global population structure, we ran an Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) on each species in GenAlEx, and evaluated the significance of global population differentiation ( PT) with 1000 permutations. We calculated pairwise F ST's in Arlequin v. 3.1 (Excoffier et al. 2005). Significance of these estimates was tested using 1000 permutations of the dataset. Note 77that this measure does not make assumptions ab out Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. To visualize relationships between populations, we conducted a principal coordinates analyses (PCoA) in GenAlEx using pairwise F ST, and visualized results from the first two axes of variation on a biplot. The program Structure (Pritchard et al. 2000) is increasingly used in population genetic studies, as it allows the user to determine popula tion structure without making a priori decisions about the population assignment of individual samples. Structure uses a Bayesian approach to assign individuals to populations by minimizing linkage disequilibrium (Pritchard et al. 2000). However, because isolation by distance in geogra phically large datasets can lead to erroneous estimates of the number of populations, k, we avoided using Structur e to assign individuals to populations for B. simaruba and F. insipida. Because preliminary analyses of the B. alicastrum data from an individual-level PCoA revealed evidence of three strongly differentiated clusters (data not shown), with cluster membership split with in populations, we used Structure v 2.2 on this dataset to investigate indi vidual population membership. We used an admixture model with correlated allele frequencies, and ran the model for 100,000 generations, with a 10,000 generation burn-in, for two to ten populat ions, using 10 replicates. We evaluated k using the method of Evanno et al. (2005). Landscape genetic analyses . Recent landscape genetic studies have demonstrated that connectivity models inco rporating complex geographic features can better explain patterns of genetic differentiation than geographic distance (Petren et al. 2005; Mc Rae Geogr aphic features that may affect gene dispersal can be tested against e ach other, and the relative effect of each distance measure can be tested with causal modeling (Figure 4.2; Legendre a nd Troussellier , partial Mantel tests (Smouse et al. 1986) are used to determine the effect of a predictor variable (e.g. temper ature or land cover) on a response variable (genetic distance), af ter controlling for a third variab le (e.g. geographic distance). All possible combinations of predicto r variables are evaluated, and th e significance of each model combination can be used to infer the effect of each variable on genetic distance (Figure 4.2). The rationale behind this approach is that, if several independent pr edictor variables can individually explain a response variable (e.g. ge netic distance), then they each need to be accounted for when testing each for significant associat ions with the response variable. We used Circuitscape 2.2 (McRae 2006) to ge nerate two sets of distance matrices: one set that incorporates landscape shape, distinguishing between la nd and bodies of water; and a second set that incorporates temperature, as bo th of these factors may substantially influence gene flow patterns in plants. Circuitscape borrows algorithms from circuit theory to calculate the total resistance between two points based on mu ltiple pathways between these points (McRae 2006). As input, the program takes a geo-referenced grid, where each cell of the grid is assigned a 'friction' value proport ional to the potential barrier to movement of an organism's genes through the cell. We generated geo-referenced gr ids as follows: we downloaded a grid containing average annual temperature information ('Bioclim atic variable 1') at a resolution of 2.5 arc- minutes (roughly 5 km at the equator) from th e Worldclim database (Hijmans et al. 2005a, http://www.worldclim.org/), and cropped it to co ver the extent of the area of our genetic sampling. We assigned values to each grid cell a ccording to the rationale explained below in DIVA-GIS (Hijmans et al. 2005b). A persistent problem in landscape genetics is how to numerically represent the friction value of a landscape feature (Cushman et al. 200 6; Beier et al. 2008; Pe rez-Espona et al. 2008). 79Since there is often no way to empirically derive how resistant a landscap e feature is to gene flow, we used an incremental approach. First, fo r the 'landscape shape' grids, we coded all land as equally permeable to gene flow (friction valu e = 1). Because bodies of water may restrict gene dispersal, we coded lakes, inlets, and ocean as having twice, twenty, or 200 times the resistance as land cover, resulting in th ree land cover models. Second, fo r the temperature grids, we evaluated three temperature thresholds (20, 22, and 24 C) based on a minimum range of mean annual temperatures measured across Costa Rican lowland forest field si tes (Holdridge et al. 1971), below which high friction values were assigned. Thus, areas wi th colder annual temperatures than the assigned th reshold should be less permeable to gene flow. To discern the effect of different friction values, we tested a range of values for each temperature model (20, 200, and 2000). Additionally, all water bodies were gi ven the same friction value as land cover, in order to disentangle the eff ects of land cover and temperature. Simple Mantel tests between 'landscape feature' and gene tic distance were conducted on each model from both landscape shape and temperature grids. Following the rationa le that the most biologi cally reasonable model will best explain genetic distance (c.f. Lee- Yaw et al. 2009; Zellmer and Knowles 2009), we chose the model with the highest correlation coefficient ( r) for further tests (causal modeling). Using geographic distance, la ndscape-mediated distance, and temperature-mediated distance as predictor variables, and genetic dist ance as the response variab le, we determined the strength of the association of the predicto r variable with linearized genetic distance (F ST/(1-F ST), Rousset 1997), after controlling fo r the effects of a third predicto r variable, using partial Mantel tests (Smouse et al. 1986). The significance of each test allo wed us to determine whether geographic distance, landscape shape distance, te mperature-mediated distance, or a combination of two or three distances, best explained geneti c distance, and was thus the most suitable model 80(Figure 4.2). We used the vegan package in the statistical lan guage R (http://www.r-project.org) to conduct all Mantel tests, a nd assessed significance using 9, 999 permutations and Bonferroni corrections for family-wise error rates. Testing confounding historical patterns . The Central American landbridge has a fairly recent geological history (Coates and Ob ando 1996), and there is no fossil pollen evidence to date the arrival of the three species. Ther efore, it is possible that histor ical processes, such as past geological or climatic change, still influence patte rns of genetic structure, as the populations may not have reached migration-drift equilibrium. In a recent study, we found spatially concordant structuring of chloroplast DNA (c pDNA), where there is no obvious current barrier to gene flow, in all three species, suggesti ng the presence of a Pleistocen e phylogeographic break (Poelchau and Hamrick, in prep). If the events causing th e phylogeographic break were indeed recent, and populations had not yet reached migration-drift equilibrium, associations between chloroplast and nuclear genetic distance would still persist (B irky et al. 1989; Turgeon and Bernatchez 2001; Kremer 2002; Kolbe et al. 2008). Because ch loroplast and nuclear genetic structure may be driven by the same processes and are therefore no t independent, it is not justified to use cpDNA genetic distance as a predictor variable in our causal modeling procedure: genetic differentiation, as measured by one marker, should not have a ca usal effect on differentiation measured with a different marker. Instead, to determine whet her chloroplast and nuclear DNA distances are correlated, we regressed pairwi se cpDNA distance from our previous study, as measured by the average pairwise distance between populations (dA, Nei and Li 1979), against pairwise F ST derived from AFLP data for this study, for each species. Additionally, we calculated the same relationship while correcting for geographic distance. As above, we determined the significance of each relationship via Mantel test. 814.3 RESULTS Diversity and population structure. We generated AFLP data for 631, 528, and 408 individuals from B. simaruba, B. alicastrum, and F. insipida , respectively, from 23 to 33 populations per species (Table 4.1). We recovered 152 loci for B. simaruba , 115 loci for and 130 loci for F. insipida . Because some samples suffered from poor DNA extract quality, we had to remove a few populations from the analysis of each species that retained <10 individuals per population ( B. simaruba : Chi, WTD; B. alicastrum : Cah, CeB, PiB; F. insipida : ElO, LaE, PiB). PT values, as calculated from the AMOVA, were significant (p = 0.001 for all species), but particularly strong in B. alicastrum (PT = 0.439, Table 4.2). Average diversity, as measured by the Shannon-Weaver index (I), varied slightly between species ( B. simaruba: 0.12, B. alicastrum: 0.14, F. insipida: percenta ge of polymorphic loci ( %P) was also somewhat variable both w ithin and between species, with F. insipida having the highest percentage (41%) and B. simaruba the lowest (33%, Table 4.1). Pairwise F ST values ranged from 0 to 0.8 ( B. simaruba: 0.0009 where the within-species average wa s 0.25, 0.36, and 0.12, respectively (Table 4.2). Eighty-eight percent of the comparisons were significant for B. simaruba , 83% for B. alicastrum , and 49% of comparisons were significant for F. insipida after Bonferroni correction for family- wise error rates. We visualized relationships among populations and regions with Principal Coordinates Analyses of pairwise F ST (Figure 4.3). The first two axes explained 67%, 79%, and 80% of the variation in B. simaruba, B. alicastrum, and F. insipida , respectively. In B. simaruba, the first axis demonstrates a clear divisi on between populations to the Paci fic and Caribbean sides of the Cordilleras, with the excepti on of one south Pacific Costa Rican population grouping with the 82Caribbean populations (Figure 4.3a). The c ontinuous north-south al ignment of Pacific populations along the second axis su ggests a trend of isol ation by distance in these populations. Similarly, in F. insipida, the first axis of variation shows a north-south alignment of all samples; however, a trend of population divi sion between eastern and western populations is not apparent (Figure 4.3c). In B. alicastrum , very different patterns emerge: four highly differentiated clusters occur, and while Panamanian populations cl uster together, populations from throughout the remainder of the range are grouped in another cluster, and populations from El Salvador, Nicaragua, and western Costa Ri ca cluster in the remaining tw o groups (Figure 4.3b). Further exploratory analyses using an i ndividual-level PCoA suggested th at several populations had split membership in two diverged clusters. We used Structure v2.2 (Pritchard et al. 2000) to determine population membership, which resulted in f our optimal clusters. These were roughly geographically partitioned: one cluster occurred predominately in Panama, one in Costa Rica, one in Nicaragua, and one in El Salvador, al though there was some overlap between regions (Figure 4.4). Interestingly, geogr aphic divergence among clusters visually corresponds with at least two areas of cpDNA divergence (Poelchau and Hamrick, in prep). Landscape genetic analyses. Our approach to determine the most suitable combination of temperature threshold and fricti on value yielded three land cover and three temperature models with the highest r value for each species (Table 4.3) . While in some cases, correlation coefficients were robust to cha nges in friction values, they va ried in others, underscoring the importance of testing multiple friction values when investigating landscape effects. Based on causal modeling, temperature best explains genetic distance in B. simaruba : in this species, genetic distance was significantly associated with temperature, controlling for both geographic and landscape shape distance, while none of the other associati ons were significant 83(Table 4.4). In F. insipida, geographic distance, after cont rolling for landscape shape and temperature, best explains genetic distance (Tab le 4.4). While temperature, after controlling for landscape shape, also explains much of the variation in genetic distance ( r = 0.4588, corrected p = 0.0006), this relationship did not hold wh en geographic distance was accounted for ( r = - 0.0769), suggesting that temperature pr esents little to no barrier to gene flow in this species. In B. alicastrum , an 'Isolation by temperature' mode l was supported; only temperature was significantly associated with genetic distance when geographic distance and landscape distance was controlled for (Table 4.4). Testing for confounding historical patterns . To control for historical effects on nuclear genetic structure, we tested the association betw een chloroplast and AFLP genetic distance. Relationships were not significant for B. simaruba (simple Mantel: r = 0.003821, p = 0.4715; partial Mantel: r = -0.03098, p = 0.6141) or F. insipida (simple Mantel: r = 0.00128, p = 0.4331; partial Mantel: r = 0.07815, p = 0.2704) , but were highly significant for B. alicastrum for both regular ( r = 0.4833, p = 0.0001) and part ial Mantel tests ( r = 0.3375, p = 0.0015), suggesting that historical events are confounding patterns of ge netic differentiation, and calling into question whether temperature is a useful predictor of genetic structure in this species. 4.4 DISCUSSION Do similar landscape-level processes st ructure genetic variation across species? While strong genetic structure occurs in each co-d istributed tree species, we find that different processes contribute to populat ion differentiation across speci es, contrary to our initial expectations. This is visualized by among-populat ion relationships via PCoA, and confirmed by causal modeling. 84 We found evidence for temperature-mediated genetic differentiation among B. simaruba populations. This suggests that this species' seed dispersers, pollinators, physiological tolerances, or a combination thereof, are limited by colder te mperatures at higher elev ations of the Central American mountains. B. simaruba is pollinated and dispersed by a variety of insect and bird species, although there are reports of dispersal being dominated by one or few bird species, most notably vireos (Croat 1978; Greenberg et al. 199 5). We observed the species at higher elevations (up to 1500 m) during our collections, but mos tly as a living fence, and seldom growing naturally; therefore, it may not recruit effectively at lower te mperatures due to physiological limitations. We found no associa tion between chloroplast and nuc lear genetic distance; this would tentatively indicate that historical processes have no rema ining effect on our measure of nuclear genetic differentiati on in this species, although it is not conclusive proof. Our results suggest that temperature is not the predominant limiting factor to gene flow in F. insipida. While correlations between temperature and genetic distance were significant at all friction values at the 20\u00baC a nd 22\u00baC thresholds, the associat ion did not hold once geographic distance - which had the highest correlation with genetic distan ce (Table 4.3) - was accounted for (Table 4.4). This indicates that simple lin ear distance between populati ons is more important in driving genetic structure among our sample d populations. This reflects some biological reality: herbarium records of F. insipida indicate that this species is more frequent at higher elevations than B. simaruba or B. alicastrum (www.tropicos.org ; data not shown), suggesting that it, or its dispersers and pollinators, is no t as physiologically limited at lower temperatures. Ecological niche models also confir m that its distribution is not as limited at higher elevations as B. simaruba and B. alicastrum (Poelchau and Hamrick, unpublished data). However, it is worth noting that we were unable to collect many populations in southw estern and southeastern Costa 85Rica, which are separated by the highest elevatio ns, and therefore lowest temperatures (Figure 4.1). Therefore, we can only make few inferenc es about pairwise genetic distances between populations in this region; sampli ng at a finer scale may have allo wed us to detect more subtle differentiation mediated by lowe r temperatures. Similar to B. simaruba , nuclear and chloroplast genetic distances are not correlated, implying that historical processes do not strongly influence our conclusions. A more complex pattern emerges in B. alicastrum. For this species, in concordance with our initial predictions, we observed strong co rrelations between temperature and genetic distance, which was the supported model (Tab le 4.4). This would suggest that colder temperatures restrict gene flow in this lowland forest species. However, this interpretation should be treated with caution, as we show strong associ ations between chloropl ast and nuclear genetic distance in this species. Because of this, it is difficult to inte rpret whether temperature actually contributes to population divergence in this species, or if instead nuc lear genetic stru cture is still driven by historical associations . However, our results suggest th at some process is maintaining associations between chloroplast and nuclear genetic structure in B. alicastrum . Brosimum alicastrum may be a recent colonist of the Central American landbridge. Previously, we found evidence for Pleistocene phylogeogra phic breaks in this species, in areas roughly coinciding with the nuclear genetic differentiation found in this study (Figure 4.4; Poelchau and Hamrick, in prep). Based on a range of substitution rates for chloroplast DNA, divergence between Costa Rican and Nicaraguan populations may have occurre d as recently as 25,000 years ago, and even 11,000 years ago between Nicaraguan and El Salv adorian populations, although there is some probability that divergence occurred earlier. We do not have enough data to determine when gene flow between these populations could have re sumed; if this was recent, it may explain why 86nuclear and chloroplast associations persist. Second, biological mechanisms may contribute to the maintenance of diversity in this species. There is a known, but sparsely documented fruiting time polymorphism in this species in the north of its range (http://www.tr opicos.org/Home.aspx), and the southern form of this species has been regarded as a separate sub-species, B. alicastrum bolivarense (Croat 1978; Berg 2001). The existence of a separate sub-species may help to explain the extremely high F ST values found in this species (Table 4.2). Although our morphological data for this species is too limite d to make inferences on associations between phenotype and genotype, it is possibl e that the four clusters we detected in our nuclear data (Figure 4.4) correspond to diffe rent biological forms of B. alicastrum. To our knowledge, no work has been conducted on repr oductive isolating mechanisms in this species to support whether gene flow is restricted between forms. In the future, it will be necessary to disentangle the contributions of historical and biological processes in th e genetic divergence of these populations to determine whether they are on inde pendent evolutionary trajectories, or whether patterns of nuclear genetic structure simply refl ect historical isolati on of recent landbridge colonists that have since resume d gene flow between populations. We observed discordance between nuclea r and chloroplast genetic distance in B. alicastrum . This result is expected in areas of se condary contact between formerly isolated populations (e.g. Latta and Mitton 1999), but could al so result from higher levels of gene flow via pollen than via seed, balancing selection on nuclear loci (e . g. Hare et al. 1996), or selection for different haplotypes in di fferent regions (e.g. Cavers et al. 2003a). Empirically, this discordance has been demonstrated in cases of post-glacial range expansion in temperate trees (Ennos 1994; et al. al. these studies, an inte raction between historical diverg ence, and higher levels of gene 87flow via pollen is invoked as the driver of this pattern. In some instan ces, alternative methods have been used to distinguish between potential historical or current causes for the different patterns of genetic structure ac ross marker types (e. g. Hare et al. 1996; Latta and Mitton 1999; Turgeon and Bernatchez gi ven the spatially conc ordant patterns of chloroplast turnover across all three species, historic al barriers to gene flow are more likely to have caused the structure observed in the chloropl ast DNA, as more restricted seed flow would result in spatially idiosyncratic areas of ge netic differentiation (Irwin 2002). It is not parsimonious to assume that selection is driving similar patterns of chloroplast genetic structure across multiple, unrelated species. Finally, becau se we are using many AFLP loci to measure nuclear genetic structure, and balancing sele ction should only affect a small portion of the genome, we would not expect to find a strong e ffect of selection on overall genetic structure across >100 loci. We have shown different effects of landscap e features on genetic structure in three co- distributed tree species. In two species ( B. simaruba and B. alicastrum ), incorporating landscape features resulted in a better fit with genetic distance than simple geographic distance (Table 4.4). Several caveats to our analysis should be mentioned, however. First, measurements of genetic structure only represent indire ct estimates of gene flow. Mi gration rate derived from F ST represents an integrated measur e of gene flow across generati ons, and assumes migration-drift equilibrium, which is often violated in na tural populations (Whitlock and McCauley 1999). While our analysis is a first step in identifying barriers to gene flow, fi ner-scale studies that directly estimate patterns of gene flow, for ex ample using paternity analyses, may give more conclusive evidence of factors inhibiting gene flow between populations (Aldrich and Hamrick 1998; Trapnell et al. 2004; Hardesty et al. 2005 ; Jones et al. 2005). Additionally, ecological 88studies of pollinators and dispersers would be useful in parsing out the effects of landscape features on pollen and seed flow (Sork et al. 1999). Other abiotic factors may be important in limiting gene flow in lowland tree species. In th is study, we only tested three factors that may limit gene flow, and it is possible that other e nvironmental variables th at we did not include restrict gene flow among popul ations. Strong precipitation gr adients exist throughout Central America, which limit the distribution of wet a nd seasonally dry forest (Janzen 1983). A previous study on a tree species spanning this gradient, Cedrela odorata , found evidence of nuclear and organellar differentiation coinci dent with the precipitation clin e; the authors suggested that different rainfall regimes were maintaining diffe rences between pre-adap ted ecotypes (Cavers et al. 2003a). The species addressed in this study are also found in both wet and dry forest habitat, and populations occurring in different moisture regimes are probably locally adapted. However, differentiation across presumably neutral marker s is not expected to be associated with environmental changes unless selection is par ticularly strong (Endler 1973; Slatkin 1985), although tests for outlier loci with extreme pa tterns of differentiation - which may be under selection - have been developed for datasets with large numbers of loci (Beaumont and Nichols 1996). Instead, moisture patterns may be a useful predictor of gene flow in species whose distributions are restrict ed by moisture, and where different environments represent breaks in population connectivity. Implications for phylogeography. In our previous study on the ch loroplast phylogeography of the three species, we suggested that spatially coinci dent genetic breaks may not be a result of a common biogeographic history, but instead are a function of pseudocongruence - seemingly congruent patterns of genetic stru cture that were nonetheless gene rated by different forces. We base this suggestion on interspeci fic variation in the locations of the phylogeographic breaks, as 89well as divergence time: while divergence time wa s placed in the Pleistocene for two of the species, populations appeared to have diverged earlier in B. simaruba than in B. alicastrum. Based on our AFLP data, it is possible that B. alicastrum arrived at the landbridge much later than B. simaruba and F. insipida (given similar generation times between species), and that residual structure from the source populati ons has not yet been eroded by gene flow. Additionally, these species may have colonize d the landbridge via different routes (i.e., colonization of the landbridge from Mexico or South America). Because of the different topographic barriers facing the sp ecies during a North-to-South vs . South-to-North colonization, it is conceivable that the diffe rent observed patterns of gene tic structure could have been generated this way, as well. Alternatively, biologi cal differences between haplotypes and clusters are maintaining the observed genetic structure. Th e suggestion of cytonucle ar disequilibrium in B. alicastrum would thus indicate that ve ry different processes have operated to generate genetic structure in B. alicastrum than in the other two species, which would support the notion of pseudocongruence. Conclusions. Contrary to our initial e xpectations, we demonstrate that elevation-mediated temperature change has influenced patterns of genetic structure in on ly two of these three lowland tree species, but that this pattern may be confounded by historical a ssociations in at least one of these species. Our results suggest, in conc ordance with interpretati ons of other population genetic studies of Central American trees, that patterns of genetic structure may reflect an interaction of historical and contemporary pr ocesses, and that the extent and pattern of differentiation is unpredictable among lowland species. While this observation may pose difficulties in identifying a unifying biogeographic history of the Central American landbridge, it nonetheless suggests that landscape genetic studies of tr ees in this region are fruitful ground for 90investigating the overlay of contemporary and hist orical processes within a geographically small, yet historically and topographically dynamic area. Further studies on species that share temperature limitations, dispersal syndromes, or co lonization histories may help to parse out the individual forces structuring ge netic variation in this region.

Few regional-scal e population genetic studies of Central American trees have been attempted (Cavers et al. 2003a ; Miller and Schaal 2006; Dick et al. 2007; Dick and Heuertz 2008 ), and while virtually all have found strong genetic structure, they have not attempted to identify its cause. Instead, most studies have invoked the inherent complexity of population genetic patterns when th ey are influenced by multiple historical events, coupled with current strong topographic gradient s as barriers to gene flow. However, the identification of a phylogeographi c break - an area where signif icant phylogeographic turnover occurs across multiple species, with no current apparent barrier to gene flow - may allow us to distinguish between the complex ov erlay of historical and current barriers to gene flow, as a shared genetic break would indicate a common driv er of past population di fferentiation. In fact, a previous phylogeographic study of a Central Am erican tree suggested the presence of a phylogeographic break in Costa Rica (Cavers et al. 2003a). My objective was to determine whether a phylogeographic break did indeed exist, and then to identify what process may have caused population differentiation across multiple speci es. In particular, I asked whether Pliocene geological or Pleistocene climate change, the most documented historical events that may have strongly impacted tree gene flow in the past, drove patterns of genetic structure in three lowland forest tree species in Central America. Additiona lly, I sought to ask whether the same processes drove differentiation across species, or whether species responded indivi dually to past and 99current barriers to gene flow and dispersa l; and thus, whether a ny observed phylogeographic break was in fact pseudo-congr uent. If population differentiati on in these three species was driven by the same process, this would be st rong evidence that observed patterns of genetic structure speak to a common assembly history of these forests, and would suggest a strong role of historical processes in driv ing genetic differentiation, and perh aps species diversity patterns in this region. In contrast, identifying multiple pro cesses would underscore the complexity of the colonization and population diversifi cation of the landbridge flora. I was able to gather strong support for a Pleistocene phylogeographic break in northwestern Costa Rica, and some support for an additional break between El Salvador and Nicaragua, based on both spatial and temporal congruence with prior hypotheses on the spatial location of Pleistocene forest re fugia in Central America (Brown 1987). However, there is little evidence, based on climate modeling studies from my own work and others', to support the notion that Pleistocene climate change drove this differentiation. Additionally, while the divergence time of two of the focal species dated to the Pleistocene, as opposed to the Pliocene, divergence still occurred much more recently in one species, Brosimum alicastrum , as opposed to the other species, Bursera simaruba . This observation is perhaps reinforced by the pattern found using nuclear AFLP data from B. alicastrum , in comparison with patterns from B. simaruba and F. insipida : because nuclear and chloroplast genetic distances in B. alicastrum were correlated, it is possible th at divergent lineages recently col onized from an ancestral source (e.g. South America), and not enou gh generations have elapsed for gene flow to erode genetic structure in the nuclear data. This would sugge st that landbridge col onization occurred more recently in this species than in B. simaruba , and that due to the different timing, factors contributing to population divergence in these speci es are different. Altern atively, if cytonuclear 100disequilibrium is act ually present in B. alicastrum populations, this could result from biological barriers to gene flow between separate lineages . This species has a sparsely documented fruiting time and color polymorphism. It is possible, alth ough not demonstrated, that gene flow between variants could be temporally restricted, and c ould thus reinforce existing genetic subdivisions. Regardless of the mechanism driving the associa tions between chloroplast and nuclear genetic distance, whether common processes led to popu lation differentiation ac ross all species is, unfortunately, s till unclear. There are several ways to clarify whether ps eudo-congruence is actually occurring. First, further studies should take genetic data from throughout the range of each species into account. Rangewide data would be useful because it would distinguish wh ether population differentiation occurred in situ in Central America, or whether different lineages currently observed in Central America stem from populations that diverged in South America. While I was unable to collect rangewide data from B. alicastrum and F. insipida , an analysis of chloroplast data from throughout the range of B. simaruba is ongoing, and may shed light in to the colonization process for this species. Second, a more thorough understa nding of geological events in the Pleistocene might help to identify whether non-climate based events could have driven population differentiation. Analyses of the geological hist ory of the Central American landbridge are ongoing (Fisher et al. 1994; Mann et al. 2007), in particular of its dynamic volcanic activity (Dull et al., in review), and may help to determine additional past barriers to gene exchanged in the plant species of this region. Additionally, a formal test for cytonuclear disequilibrium in B. alicastrum would help to determine whether dive rgence between chloroplast lineages are eroding, or are being maintained. 101BIBLIOGRAPHY Abbott, R.
