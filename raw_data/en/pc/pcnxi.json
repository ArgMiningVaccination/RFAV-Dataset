Can I share some of what I know with you? The reason NACI, public health and I recommend this vaccine, is because it gives us a chance to protect the kid directly: this is so that when they get exposed to this virus, it protects against severe disease and hospitalization . KEEP IT PERSONALHow did Mira do with the COVID-19 vaccine? My two older kids have had both of their shots and I have been sharing that in the hopes that more families in my practice get protected too . NORM Discuss whether 8 weeks or shorter interval is the right choice for that "}
