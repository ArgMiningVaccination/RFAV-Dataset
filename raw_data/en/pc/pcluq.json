To establish responsibilities and procedures for protecting patients and personnel from bloodborne pathogens, e.g., human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus or other pathogens transmitted through contact with blood and body fluids. - OBJECTIVES. - To prevent the transmission of bloodborne pathogens from infected patients or visitors to healthcare workers. - To protect Indian Health Service (IHS) patients and visitors to IHS healthcare facilities from being infected by bloodborne pathogens. - To comply with Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regulations at Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Subsection 1910.1030 (29 CFR, 1910.1030). - SCOPE. This circular applies to all IHS employees, including those assigned to Public Law (P.L) 93-638 facilities. The law and implementing regulations apply to Indian Self-Determination Act, P.L. 93-638 and to Title V urban program contractors as employers. Tribal contractors are strongly encouraged to adopt this circular. - DEFINITIONS. Blood -- means human-blood, human blood components, and blood products made from human blood. Bloodborne Pathogens -- means pathogenic microorganisms that are present in human blood and can cause disease in humans. These pathogens include, but are not limited to, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Body Substance Isolation -- is an infection control system where all body substances are considered to be potentially infectious. It is equivalent to Universal Precautions. Clinical Laboratory -- means a workplace where diagnostic or other screening procedures are performed on blood or other potentially infectious materials. Contaminated -- means the presence or the reasonably anticipated presence of blood or other potentially infectious materials on an item or surface. Contaminated Laundry -- means laundry or linen which has been soiled with blood or other potentially infectious materials or may contain sharps. Contaminated Sharps -- means any contaminated object that can penetrate the skin including, but not limited to needles, scalpels, broken glass, broken capillary tubes, and exposed ends of dental wires. Decontamination -- is a physical or chemical process to remove, inactivate, or destroy pathogens on a surface or item so that they are no longer capable of transmitting infectious particles and the surface or item is rendered safe for handling, use or disposal. Engineering Controls -- means controls (e.g., sharps disposal containers, self-sheathing needles) that isolate or remove the bloodborne pathogens hazard from the workplace. Exposure Incident -- means a specific eye, mouth, other mucous membrane, non-intact skin, or parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that results from the performance of an employee?s duties. Handwashing Facility -- means a facility providing an adequate supply of tempered running potable water, soap and single use towels or hot air drying machines. HBV -- means hepatitis B virus. Healthcare Professional -- means a physician or other licensed healthcare provider authorized to accomplish the evaluation procedures described in this policy, e.g., a registered nurse could be authorized to perform the required evaluation. HIV --- means human immunodeficiency virus Type-1. Unless it is stated otherwise, all reference to HIV means HIV-1. IHS Facility -- means any IHS healthcare facility. All contract facilities operated by a tribal organization under P.L. 93-638, ?Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act? or Urban Indian Health Centers are encouraged to adopt this IHS policy or shall develop equivalent policies which meet the minimum requirements of 29 CFR, 1910.1030. Occupational Exposure -- means reasonably anticipated skin, eye, mucous membrane, or parenteral contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials that may result from the performance of an employee?s duties. Other Potentially Infectious Materials -- means: - The following human body fluids: semen, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, saliva in dental procedures, urine (because of cytomegalovirus) any body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood, and all body fluids in situations where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between body fluids; - Any unfixed tissue or organ (other than intact skin) from a human (living or dead); and - The HIV-containing cell or tissue cultures, organ cultures, and HIV- or HBV-containing culture medium or other solutions. Parenteral -- means piercing mucous membranes or the skin barrier through such events as needle sticks, human bites, cuts, and abrasions. Personal Protective Equipment -- is specialized clothing or equipment worn by an employee for protection against a hazard. General work clothes (e.g. uniforms, pants, skirts, shirts or blouses) not intended to function as protection against a hazard are not considered to be personal protective equipment. Regulated Waste -- means liquid or semi-liquid blood or other potentially infectious materials; contaminated items that would release blood or other potentially infectious materials in a liquid or semi-liquid state if compressed; items that are caked with dried blood or other potentially infectious materials and are capable of releasing these materials during handling; contaminated sharps; and pathological and microbiological wastes containing blood or other potentially infectious materials. Source Individual -- means any individual, living or dead, whose blood or other potentially infectious materials may be a source of occupational exposure to the employee. Examples include, but are not limited to hospital and clinic patients, trauma victims, clients of drug and alcohol treatment facilities, and human remains. Sterilize -- means the use of a physical or chemical procedure to destroy all microbial life including highly resistant bacterial endospores. Universal Precautions -- is an approach to infection control. According to the concept of Universal Precautions, all human blood and certain human body fluids are treated as if known to be infectious for HIV, HBV, and other bloodborne pathogens. In the IHS, Body Substance Isolation may be used in place of Universal Precautions. Work Practice Controls -- means controls that reduce the likelihood of exposure blood or body fluids by eliminating a task or altering the manner in which a task is performed (e.g., prohibiting recapping of needles by two-handed technique). - RESPONSIBILITIES. - Headquarters Technical Consultant on Bloodborne Pathogens. The Associate Director, Office of Health Programs (OHP), or designee, shall be the IHS technical consultant for the control of exposure to bloodborne pathogens. - Area Technical Consultant on Bloodborne Pathogens.
