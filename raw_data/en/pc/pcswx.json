It has a soothing ambiance and chill vibe, Samantha the Patient Services Coordinator is majorly on top of things--scheduling was a breeze--and the treatment provided by Dr. Joseph was unlike anything I've ever experienced. Everything was exceptional!! I've had plenty of rodeos with western medicine, and while I understand the advantages of it, I was feeling underwhelmed by the treatment I've received from some practitioners of late. I'm extremely health conscious and in tune with when my body is out of whack. I went to NNM seeking relief from myriad problems, and six visits later, I feel like a new person. Dr. Giacona delves into the root of your issues and listens like no other doctor I've seen maybe ever, and I saw results after my very first visit. He took a wholistic approach to solving my problems, provided plenty of literature outlining his principles and explaining the treatment plan, and was clear about the role I would need to play in solving my health issues. Also, I've gotten acupuncture before but this is on an entirely new level--I now know that not all acupuncture is created equal! I'm so happy I found NNM, and have referred my friends and loved ones, and wanted to leave this review to encourage anyone looking for an alternative or supplement for their current medical treatment to try this place out!! - 6/25/2022 I've been an on & off patient for the last 5 years, and will say Samantha & Dr J are both incredibly caring people who are passionate about being a force for positivity in the world. He's really helped my TMJ, digestion, mood/anxiety/stress regulation, dry eye, and then some! Acupuncture can take a little longer to work, but your body knows when it's been helped! For me, I usually go in 2-5 month cycles of treatments pending when things feel they've gotten back to homeostasis. There's never pressure to go back and I have never felt like I'm being upsold or forced to take on more sessions than I need or want -- it's always been make an appointment to come back if you want to (unless it looks like there's something really off but at that point I'm already booked before they say anything!). He also leads meditation sessions at Kandapa Center by McCarren Park for those who are looking for mindfulness or guided meditation but that is separate from acupuncture. - 2/10/2022 Based on a friend's recommendation, I started seeing Dr. Joseph when traditional doctors said there was nothing they could do to help with a skin condition. After making some adjustments to my diet and going on supplements, I started seeing real results. Aside from taking care of the physical side, Dr. Joseph has been very supportive when I was experiencing mental health issues. Samantha has also been supportive and accommodating when it comes to scheduling! If you're searching for a path towards healing, I highly recommend coming here! - 9/18/2019 DISCLAIMER: I see there is a trend here where Neighborhood Natural Medicine replies to almost every negative review with a personalized passive/aggressive rant against the reviewer. I am asking that Samantha and Joseph please respect my opinion and *please do not reply to my review*. I do not want my personal information shared. This is just my experience. I am not seeking a follow-up. Experience: I had contacted Neighborhood Natural Medicine through their website after finding their services online. I was seeking some natural medicine for some personal health issues that I have been dealing with and was hopeful after finding NNM and reading many positive testimonials on their site and Yelp. Samantha, the Patient Services Coordinator, got back to me after a day and was very helpful through her communications. Due to a cancellation I was able to get in this week. I was grateful for this. Unfortunately, my experience wasn't at all what I had expected. In short, I paid $214 for a strange experience and two bottles of \"supplements\". When I first arrived I spent 30 full minutes writing down my conditions and history on their multiple-page long questionnaire. I don't remember signing a HIPAA consent. Joseph is not a medical doctor, this is important to note. My questionnaire was flipped halfheartedly through once I was in the room with Joseph. He asked about my problems, which I described, then told me to lay down on the table. I wasn't given any explanation as to what was going to happen next. Joseph proceeded to put two unknown boxes on my stomach that held many small glass vials with clear liquids inside. I couldn't really see what was happening. He raised my right arm and would grab my upper arm as he would lift each vial up. He didn't explain what this process was, what it was for, or what he was doing. When I prompted for info he would give non-clear answers about how this is stuff is ancient practices and has been around for years. No clarity. I had mentioned that I thought I was sensitive to dairy, and one of the vials he ended up showing me was labeled \"dairy\" and he tells me that I have a strong intolerance to dairy. He also said I was sensitive to gluten but not that bad and that my cortisol levels were high. This was the extent of his physical examination. I don't want to publicly share the reasons for why I visited the office, but it is clear with my history that I am someone who is under a lot of stress (hence the cortisol levels), and I said it myself that I thought I had trouble absorbing calcium and was probably sensitive to dairy. I said how could I get my cortisol levels down, and how can I get better? He just said it's easy just don't eat dairy and make better eating choices. He also advised me to limit caffeine and sugar. He asked if I wanted to try acupuncture. I said yes. Not sure why he asked rather than recommended? Did I need it? He put two small needles in my jaw, and two small needles in my ankles. But no real explanation as to why acupuncture or why those locations (aside from saying my jaw was tense, how did he know?), he said for my case that was what was best. He asked if I had questions and I said more than once that I just wanted to know what the treatment plan was and how we were going to fix my medical issues. I even asked him about meditation. He asked me where I lived and I told him, he said \"oh I have a buddy who does meditation there\" and he proceeded to google the location on his iphone. I asked if he had any pamphlet or info, and he directed his iphone screen to me as it was loading and then read out the name of the place. This was disappointing because when I was doing my research on Neighborhood Natural Medicine I saw that Joseph taught meditation classes so I don't know why he didn't tell me about his services or even explain the art of meditation and its use to me. When I asked when I should come back or how many sessions he thought I needed he goes every week or every two weeks, or whatever you want. So I said ok what would those visits entail, and he said he would do the glass vials/ arm grabbing thing again (still don't know what the practice was) and see if I am getting better. huh? He told me he was going to give me some \"stuff\" to take too. This ended up being two supplement bottles I purchased from Samantha, one says \"Calcium Blend\" and the other says \"Adrenal Support\". I wasn't given clarity as to what exactly these supplements contained or why they should help me. As someone who is dealing with health issues, I really wanted this to work. I wouldn't mind shelling out money if I truly felt like I was being educated as to my condition and being sincerely helped. Now rereading all these 5 star reviews, none of them really say how they got better or what it is Joseph does. Where is the clarity? I hate to say this but I have some doubt as to the validity of the multiple 5 star Yelp reviews. Business owner information Joseph G. 4/25/2021 Out of concern for those who will be healed by our unique approach in the future, we humbly choose to reply to this review. We sincerely apologize for any negative experience you had here as well as not living up to your expectations. Most of our patients come to us after consulting seven or eight different doctors and specialists, armed with a battery of tests, tired credit cards - and no answers. People look at us through the lens of everyone else who has come up short, expecting us to do the same. Doctor J and I understand the butterflies and doubt when people come to see us, because our methods are unfamiliar. Many of our new patients come in apprehensive, but leave with peace and calm. Regarding Dr J's suggestion of his friend's meditation class, Dr J said that 'it was closer to her home and seemed more convenient.' Everyone (patients & non-patients) is welcome at Doctor J's classes: [meditationinwilliamsburg...](/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.meditationinwilliamsburg.org&s=f196c2484ad014bc99f2be6d9c5b13355a95c19729cf6d4816e98d2029d8f539) I would've been happy to write to Doctor J on your behalf and have him personally reply. To your peace, wisdom and perfect health, Samantha Patient Services Coordinator - 4/21/2021 I seldom write reviews but I am moved at this time to share my experience that I received at NNM . I still remember my first visit at the office it was so clean and thoughtfully designed it had a peaceful feeling to it . Samantha was so pleasant and helpful at all times along my healing journey . I started going to see Dr. J when my BODY AND MIND AND SPIRIT was hurting and I needed guidance I was in treatment for a few years with him I have say he was very patient and gentle felt that he was practicing from his heart it was Very Compassionate . Thank you Dr. J AND STAFF Cassandra - 10/6/2021 I am not someone who's had great experiences with doctors. So when I was referred to Dr J I was feeling pretty skeptical that anything he offered was going to help me. But 2.5 years inti this journey I truly feel that starting down the road of holistic medicine/acupuncture with him was one of the best decisions I ever made. I don't pretend to understand how it all works...I just know that somehow the combination of acupuncture, supplements, and dietary changes (I'm mostly dairy-free/gluten-free these days at his urging) has been a game-changer. And more than anything, I finally feel like I have one medical professional who is actually listening to me and not assuming that I don't understand my own body, my pain, and what is normal specifically for me. Just keep an open mind, remember that your symptoms may not heal in the order you want them too, and also remember that problems that took a lifetime to develop are unlikely to disappear in a month. But if you're on the fence...I urge you to give it a shot. - 4/14/2022 In sharing this review, there are two important things to understand. One, I have been dealing with chronic pain and extreme fatigue for 15 years, along with other disturbing symptoms. The second is that I have tried almost EVERYTHING (several Medical specialists, energy healing, chiropractic, yoga, fasting, elimination diets, severely restricted diets, etc...). The most success I've had in feeling truly well was in really extreme diets where I ate only a handful of foods, but even during my last 9 month period of eating a super \"clean\" and restricted diet (and was feeling quite well) I landed in the hospital with inflammation and a huge cyst, in need of emergent surgery - so clearly my underlying problems were not \"fixed\". When I sought out NNM and Dr J it was on recommendation of a friend, and I was skeptical, but also in crisis. It was difficult to even get to the office, and the pain was so intense it was affecting my mobility. Fast forward to 9 months later and I feel like I have my life back. My daily pain was almost completely gone within 2 months, which I'm still shocked by. The fatigue took longer to clear - there were points where I thought maybe I'd quit coming because that took more like 6-7 months to really improve, but I kept going because the seeing the other shifts helped give me a little faith that my body was healing. I'm so so grateful for my life back. I did make some slight dietary modifications to achieve this along with the supplements and routine sessions, but they feel like sustainable changes. Last, Dr. J really listens with kindness and empathy, and truly celebrates as I progress. To have someone so invested in my wellness and healing is rare in seeking care (ironically), and the support and attention have been part of the healing process, no doubt. Samantha is really great too - always very understanding and helpful :) - 6/30/2021 I can't say enough good things about Joe, Samantha and NNM. I first found them when I was experiencing digestive mayhem that a very reputable GI doctor seemed completely helpless in resolving. That doctor was so unhelpful that I ended up needing surgery due to an eventual infection from a wrong diagnosis, but Joe helped decrease the infection in preparation for the surgery and get my digestive system back to functioning. The surgery could have been dangerous, but ended up being simple, fast and successful because my colon had already started to heal thanks to Joe. It was crazy how much he was able to see what worked for my body food-wise and what didn't. Each of his suggestions and supplements made a massive difference. With that crisis behind me, Neighborhood Natural Medicine has turned into a monthly self-care necessity for my physical and emotional wellbeing. Back pain, trouble sleeping, tendonitis in my arm/hand, emotional ups and downs have all been lovingly and successfully treated by him. Example: I thought I was having a psychotic break and having severe anxiety and insomnia and Joe did his thing with the vials and the tapping and said, \"Nope, your hormones are going crazy\"--turns out I was starting perimenopause--gave me a calcium supplement that helped my body adjust its own hormones and POOF! Back to normal sleeping like a rock and not wanting to box strangers' ears on the street. Now he's helping me to deal with a new autoimmune disorder (Hashimotos) and the subsequent hypothyroidism in the hopes that I can avoid medication. So far the supplements and dietary suggestions have made a great difference--my mood and energy levels are up and the pain in my joints is going down and I just had new bloodwork done last week and mu thyroid numbers and autoimmune markers have improved NNM is not a typical healthcare experience which is precisely why it fits in so perfectly with my wellness goals. Too many traditional medical doctors don't get it, they're stuck in their 1980s textbooks and they don't look at the big picture. Joseph treats systems, not symptoms. Rather than treat the thyroid, he gave me supplements that would better help me digest the nutrients my body needed to treat itself. Rather than give me hormone therapy, he gave me a calcium supplement that helped my body regulate my own hormones. In response to the bad review below: I'm real. This review is real. The results are real. And the below experience isn't far off from how the appointments go, so if getting a crash course in acupuncture is critical to you, this might not be your place. Oh, and the ingredients to the supplements are listed on the side. See you next week, Joe and Sam. - 6/23/2020 I worked with Neighborhood Natural medicine for a little over a year to fix hormonal imbalances. Overall, it was a great experience. What I loved: - The setting is incredibly relaxing. There was always music playing, and plants everywhere. As someone who usually gets anxious for appointments in new environments, this was a comfort. - Samantha at the front desk is great. - They said to give it 5-8 sessions, and they were right. While the process is slow, I did feel that at the 8th session I had shown significant improvements. - I didn't feel that the treatments were ever too difficult on my body. I have been to acupuncturists where I feel exhausted for the next few days as my body tries to heal and catch up. I did not feel that in this case. Everything we did was totally manageable within my every day life. One of my biggest issues going in was that I suffered from ovarian cysts, that rupture and are very painful. During the year that I worked with NNM I did not suffer from one ovarian cyst. I also had hormonal rashes that came and went on my face, and by the end of us working together they were almost completely healed. A few things you should know beforehand: - They are always very busy, which means that visits can feel rushed at times. I felt that I need to keep asking questions to understand the process. - They are very pushy about changing your diet, but I would take everything with a grain of salt. Some of the books in the waiting room were based on fad diets and bad science. NNM has some great suggestions, but I would first and foremost listen to your body. As I was getting ready to move away from New York, it wasn't exactly clear to me how to sustain the progress I had made other than maintaining a healthy diet, low stress. I was unsure when to stop taking the remedies, if I should seek out another natural healer in my city etc. When I asked these questions, I didn't feel completely supported by the answer. It would have been helpful to have a sort of \"exit packet\" similar to their intro packet. All goes to say, I am incredibly grateful for my time at NNM. I learned a lot about my body, and about healing beyond modern medicine. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone seeking some balance. - 4/23/2021 While I'm now generally very healthy, I have a long, complex medical history (Lyme disease, fibro, CFS, autoimmune, etc.). I have seen dozens and dozens of practitioners of every kind. This makes it easy for me to know when a practitioner stands out from the rest. Dr. J is an absolute gem. He is very different which is exactly what I was looking for. I had been to several Chinese Medicine Doctors/acupuncturists (I love acupuncture!) without any results after struggling to recover from a severe E. coli infection. My regular doctor suggested I go to a rheumatologist because the infection had kicked off an autoimmune process in my system (which was apparent in my bloodwork). I found this office on Yelp, and based on the reviews, made an appointment. I started acupuncture with Dr. J and he put me on a couple of supplements. I so appreciate that he never loads you up with supplements - it's usually 1 or 2 remedies and they are very affordable. His care was instrumental in strengthening my system and making a full recovery. It took time but eventually even my blood tests came back normal (no autoimmune markers at all). I have continued seeing Dr. J regularly even though my issue is resolved; and have also referred my family, friends, and my own clients (I'm a holistic practitioner myself). As a bonus to what I originally went for, Dr. J has helped me see great improvement in my painful menstrual cycles. I have endometriosis, and while it's improved over the years with other approaches, I have recently seen a big shift where I can even go out of the house with no worries during my period. This may seem small to some but this is a condition I've had for many many years that I've done all I can for. Or so I thought. This may also seem small but this office is run SO well and he is always on time. I'd never mind waiting a few minutes but many past practitioners I've seen are sometimes an hour or more late. Sam, the office manger, is so sweet and will bend over backwards for you. Note: As I mentioned, I have been through a lot medically. I'm not weirded out by different approaches. I'm also from CA where it's the norm to go to alternative practitioners. If you don't resonate with things that or new or different than what your doctor might suggest, Dr. J's approach may not resonate for you. If you are open minded and willing to try something new, THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO. If you want to know more during your appointments, simply ask. Dr. J. He is incredibly warm and kind and will share with you. "}
