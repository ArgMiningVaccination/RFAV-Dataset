The combination of these factors provides a powerful incentive for research on the effectiveness and safety of CAM therapies and their role in treating children. This article describes a rationale, spectrum, priorities, and methodologies for a research agenda in holistic pediatrics. The top priorities are clinical research projects addressing the safety and effectiveness of alternative therapies used for vulnerable children suffering from serious illnesses. Additionally, major research questions involve the impact of the various definitions such as \"alternative,\" \"complementary,\" \"folk,\" \"integrative,\" and \"holistic\" medicine on perceptions of health care, professional education, and funding of products and services.

European Journal of Pediatrics Journal of the Society for Integrative Oncology 2009 The present study evaluated the dose-related effects of CVT-E002, a proprietary extract of Panax quinquefolius (CV Technologies Inc., Edmonton, AB), in the treatment of a tumor of viral origin, that is, erythroleukemia, in mice. Three treatments including ingestion of 2, 40, and 120 mg/d were compared. The study revealed that the dose of 40 mg/d was particularly effective in stimulating cells mediating nonspecific immunity and extending the life span of tumor-bearing mice. This study represents the first in vivo demonstration of the anticancer efficacy of CVT-E002 in an animal model. CVT-E002 treatment significantly elevated the absolute numbers of natural killer cells and monocytes and reduced the number of tumor cells in the bone marrow and spleen. This study has shown that (1) approximately 30 to 50% of tumor-bearing mice administered CVT-E002 at a dose of 40 mg/d achieved a significantly extended life span, and (2) dosage is critical in producing these ameliorative effects.
