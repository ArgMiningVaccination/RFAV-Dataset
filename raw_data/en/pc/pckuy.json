[The Society Citation Award](/about-idsa/society-awards/#The-Society-Citation-Award)is given in recognition of exemplary contribution to IDSA, outstanding discovery in the field of infectious diseases, or a lifetime of outstanding achievement in a given area - whether research, clinical investigation or clinical practice. This year IDSA presents this award to two individuals: Steven K. Schmitt, MD, FIDSA and Brian S. Schwartz, MD. Dr. Schmitt, staff physician in the Department of Infectious Disease at the Cleveland Clinic, has been a leading voice for the appropriate recognition of the value of the infectious diseases specialist. For more than a decade, Dr. Schmitt has represented IDSA and its members with several key advisory committees of the American Medical Association, including those that define reimbursement value for the healthcare delivered by ID clinicians, making effective representation crucial for the specialty. As chair of IDSA's Value of ID Specialists Task Force, he led the group's efforts resulting in two seminal publications in Clinical Infectious Diseases: The first, in 2014, reported data demonstrating the value of ID physician consultation in the care of hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries. The second, in 2019, provided similar data for privately insured patients under the age of 65. The two studies have formed the backbone of efforts to demonstrate the value of ID physicians to the systems where they practice. Whether hearing him speak to fellows at IDSA's Clinical Fellows Meeting, to lawmakers on Capitol Hill on behalf of members and patients, or at state, regional, and national meetings for invited lectures, Dr. Schmitt's passionate advocacy for ID physicians and their value is readily apparent. A collaborative innovator, Dr. Schwartz has played a leading role in driving IDSA's efforts to support ID medical education and to develop it as an area of concentration. As increasing numbers of physicians seek careers in medical education and as the ID specialty works to attract applicants to the field, Dr. Schwartz's efforts to enhance ID medical education have been particularly critical. He has been instrumental in the development of a robust medical education track that now runs throughout IDWeek. He has also led efforts to enhance preclinical microbiology education, an important opportunity to interest medical students in careers in ID. A past member of IDSA's Education Committee, Dr. Schwartz served as the founding chair of the Society's Medical Education Work Group, and, with others, has been leading efforts to launch IDSA's Medical Education Community of Practice, the organization's first community of practice. The group will support IDSA members to become better teachers of all learner groups, and will support and advocate for the career development of clinician educators, with the end goal of helping to recruit the best and brightest to the field of ID. Dr. Schwartz is an associate professor of clinical medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. [The Clinical Teacher Award](/about-idsa/society-awards/#The-Clinical-Teacher-Award)honors a career dedicated to excellence in teaching fellows, residents or medical students, and motivating them to teach the next generation. This year the award goes to William L. Salzer, MD who, sadly, passed on Sunday, October 29. In his decades of service, Dr. Salzer became a legendary teacher and mentor to students, several of whom are now faculty members at his own institution, the University of Missouri School of Medicine. Passionate about patient care, physician training, medical education, community outreach, and mentorship, he contributed greatly to the patient-based learning curriculum as a case and exam writer; he did so since the curriculum, in which students collaboratively learn from real clinical cases, was introduced at the University of Missouri 25 years ago. Arriving early to the office and among the last to leave each day, Dr. Salzer was readily available to answer student questions and to respond to pressing educational needs, including when expert lectures were needed on short notice. Listed among US News and World Report's Best Doctors in America for 2009-2010, Dr. Salzer received more than 30 teaching awards during his career. \"On behalf of IDSA, I am truly honored to recognize each of these outstanding individuals and the contributions they have made to the field of infectious diseases. Each is an innovator, a mentor, and an inspiration. They have set a standard for future generations of infectious diseases physicians and scientists to which we all can aspire,\" said Dr. Sears.
