What vacci nations are required when my child attends a certified childcare facility ? All vaccines recommended by the ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) are required by Pennsylvania State Code for childcare , including Hepatitis A and Influenza . The v accine schedule can be found on the CDC website at: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/0 -18yrs -child -combined - schedule.pdf How many vaccines does my child receive?

M ost vaccines are multiple disease preventive and are combined to vaccinate your child with one dose. For example, the MMR vaccine combines the Measles, Mumps and Rubella disease prevention. There are many combined vaccines available. Why do we need to vaccinate our children, are n't all those diseases cured ? All the diseases that we vaccinate our children for continue to affect children all over our country and the world. We vaccinate to prevent the devastating effects that each of the diseases can cause. Can I exempt my child from receiving vaccines? Yes, if you have a philosophical or religious belief opposing one or more vaccines you may write an exemption. You must write a note stating such and sign it. Please b e aware that if there is a disease outbreak in the certified childcare facility , your child may be excluded for the duration of the outbreak if they are not vaccinated against that disease , and this could be for days, weeks or months . There are also medical exemption s from vaccinations . A medical exemption must be diagnosed and signed by a physician stating that the immunization is detrimental to the health of the child. Who is responsible for reviewing and making sure children are compliant with the immunization records in the certifie d childcare facility ? Along with the parent or guardian, the certified childcare facility is responsible for making sure the children who attend are up to date and should be reviewing the records to make sure all are current . Up to date immunization records are part of being compliant as a licensed childcare facility . Parents, please remember to give an updated immunization record to the childcare staff every time a new immunization is given. Still have questions?
