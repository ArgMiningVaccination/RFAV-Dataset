No. 61/620,054, filed Apr. 4, 2012, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTEREST [0002] The invention was made with government support under grant numbers UOl A1082206 awarded by the National Institutes of Elealth. The government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND [0003] I . Field of the Disclosure [0004] The disclosure relates to the field of virology. In particular, the disclosure relates to methods and compositions useful for inhibition of viruses that require membrane fusion for viral entry, specifically for inhibiting severe acute respi\u00ad ratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Ebola virus (EBOV), (NIV) viruses by target\u00ad ing (CatL) cleavages sites in the viruses' glyco\u00ad proteins. [0005] 2. Description of Related Art [0006] Enveloped viruses enter the target cells by fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane followed by the delivery of the viral genome to the cytoplasm. SARS- CoV, EBOV, FleV and NiV are highly infectious zoonotic viruses of this type. SARS-CoV belongs to family Coro- naviridae and causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that initially originated in the Guangdong province of China in late 2002, spread rapidly around the world along international air-travel routes, and resulted in a mortality of 10% over different parts of the world (Peiris et ah, 2004, Nat Med 10: S88-97). EBOV belongs to family Filoviridae and has been identified as the causative agent of severe hemor\u00ad rhagic fever with human case fatality rate exceeding 90% in large outbreaks (Seah, 1978, Can Med Assoc J 118: 347-8, 50). NiV and FleV are closely related and belong to the genus Henipaviruses within the Paramyxoviridae family and were first identified as the etiologic agents responsible for an out\u00ad break of fatal encephalitis among pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore in 1999 with a case fatality of 40% (Chua et ah, 1999, Lancet 354: 1257-9; Chua et ah, 2000, Science 288: 1432-5; Selvey & Sheridan, 1995, J Travel Med Med JAust 162: EBOV, HeV and NiV viruses envel\u00ad oped viruses that critically require cathepsin L (CatL), pro\u00ad cessing and cleavage allowing for virus fusion and entry into the host cells (Simmons et ah, 2005, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102:11876-81; Kaletsky et ah, Pager J Virol 79:12714-20; Pageretal., 2006, Virology 346: 251-7). SARS and Ebola viruses infect target cells after cleavage of their fusion glycoproteins by CathL in the endocytic vesicles. The Hendra and Nipah viruses fusion (F0) protein is translocated to the membrane and then inter\u00ad nalized, permitting CatL mediated cleavage into F1 and F2 subunits, required for fusion. The processed F protein is then incorporated into the viral particle (Pager & Dutch, 2005, J Virol 79:12714-20; Pager et ah, 2006, Virology 346: 251-7).[0008] The high virulence of these viruses and the absence of effective therapeutic modalities and vaccines pose an ongoing threat to the public health. There are no effective therapies for the above fatal viruses to date. Accordingly, identifying a broad spectrum small molecule antiviral drug would be an advantageous and novel approach for inhibiting those fatal viruses. [0009] Antiviral drugs can be broadly divided into 4 major classes. The earliest group of antiviral drugs to be defined consisted of nucleoside analogs that interfere with replication of the viral genome. This group includes the first successful antiviral, Acyclovir, which is effective against herpes virus infections and can delay HIV-I progression (De Clercq & Field, 2006, Br J Pharmacol 147: 1-11; Broder, 2010, Anti\u00ad viral Res 85: 1-18). The first antiviral drug to be approved for treating HIV, Zidovudine (AZT), is also a nucleoside ana\u00ad logue that blocks reverse transcriptase (De Clercq & Field, 2006, Br J Pharmacol 147: 1-11; Broder, 2010, Antiviral Res 85: 1-18). However, these nucleoside analogs, which have low affinities to cellular DNA polymerase can only taiget viruses like HIV and Herpes viruses that use their own poly\u00ad merases for genome replication. [0010] The second class of antivirals includes inhibitors of viral proteases, which are involved in the processing of viral protein chains for the final viral assembly and release. Since HIV viral assembly within the host requires a similar pro\u00ad tease, considerable research has been performed to discover \"protease inhibitors\" to attack HIV at that phase of its life cycle. Although protease inhibitors became available in the 1990s and have proven effective, they have exhibited dra\u00ad matic side effects (Flint et ah, 2009, Toxicol Pathol 37: 65-77). The limitation of protease inhibitors use includes inability to taiget a wide range of viruses as they are highly specific in action and are encoded by only certain viruses. [0011] A third-class of antivirals that have been investi\u00ad gated includes inhibitors of virus uncoating (Bishop, 1998, Intervirology 261-71; Almela et ah, 1991, Virol 65: These agents act on virus penetration/uncoating and include Amantadine and Rimantadine which have been intro\u00ad duced to combat influenza. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 100% of seasonal H3N2 and 2009 pandemic flu samples tested have shown resistance to Amantadine which is no longer recommended for treatment of influenza (Salter et ah, 2011, Intervirology 54: 305-15). [0012] The final stage in the life cycle of a virus is the release of matured viruses from the host cell, and this step has also been targeted by a fourth class of antivirals. Two drugs named Zanamivir (Relenza) and Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), which have been recently introduced to treat influenza, pre\u00ad vent the release of viral particles by blocking neuraminidase found on the surface of flu viruses (Collins et ah, 2008, Nature 453: 1258-61; Garcia-Sosa et al, 2008, JChem However, the use of these neuraminidase inhibitors is restricted to neuraminidase-containing viruses. [0013] Each of the above-mentioned antivirals is specific to a particular virus and can, thus, not be termed \"broad spec\u00ad trum\". In fact, some of these anti-virals are only effective against a narrow range within the taiget virus strains. For example, the CDC does not consider Tamiflu as an effective drug in treating H lN l Seasonal Flu due to His274Tyr muta\u00ad tion which is currently widespread in 99.6% of all tested seasonal H lN l strains. In fact, tests showed that 99.6% ofthe tested strains of seasonal H lN l flu and 0.5% of 2009 pan- US 2015/0150878 Al 2Jun. 4, 2015 demic flu were resistant to Tamiflu (Collins et al., 2008, Nature 453: 1258-61; Garcia-Sosa et al., 2008, J Chem In f Model 48: 2074-80). [0014] There have been several attempts to discover more effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV, EBOV, HeV and NiV For example, some inhibitors of papain-like protease were described which inhibit live SARS CoV infection of VeroE6 cells (Ghosh et al, 2010, JM ed Chem 53: 4968-79). Even if these inhibitors are proven to be effective in clinical trials, they are still directed against a specific virus. One group has described a small molecule named oxocarbazate which blocks human CatL thus inhibiting SARS-CoV and EBOV pseudotyped virus infection into human embryonic kidney 293T cells (Shah et al, 2010, MolPharmacol 78: 319-24). In another study, highly potent inhibitors of human CatL were identified by screening combinatorial pentapeptide amide collections (Brinker et al, 2000, Eur JBiochem 267: 5085- 92). However, inhibitors of host proteases can be potentially harmful to host physiology. [0015] Thus there exists a necessity of defining safe and effective broad spectrum small molecule antiviral drugs against these fatal viral infections.

[0236] This compound can, for example, be purchased from ChemBridge Corporation. [0237] In a fourth aspect, the disclosure provides methods for inhibiting cathepsin L-mediated cleavage of viral glyco\u00ad protein-derived peptide in a virus, the method comprising contacting the virus with an effective amount of a compound having structural formula (I), structural formula (II), or struc\u00ad tural formula (III) as described herein. As noted above and as described in more detail below, the compounds described herein can inhibit the cleavage of viral glycoprotein-derived peptide, with minimal inhibition to the host pro-neuropeptide Y-derived peptide. In certain embodiments, the virus is selected from the group consisting of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Ebola virus, Hendra virus and Nipah Virus. But as the person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, the methods can be useful with any virus that utilizes cathepsin L (CatL) as part of its infectious process. [0238] In other aspects, the disclosure provides a pharma\u00ad ceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound having structural formula (I), (II) or (III) as described herein, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable diluents, preservatives, solubilizers, emulsifiers,adjuvants, excipients, or carriers. The pharmaceutical com\u00ad position can be used, for example, for inhibiting a viral infec\u00ad tion in a mammal in need thereof, the viral infection being caused by a virus selected from the group consisting of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Ebola virus, Hendra virus and Nipah Virus. [0239] In certain aspects, the disclosure provides a pharma\u00ad ceutical composition comprising the compounds of the dis\u00ad closure together with one or more pharmaceutically accept\u00ad able excipients or vehicles, and optionally other therapeutic and/or prophylactic ingredients. Such excipients include such as water, saline, glycerol, polyethylene glycol, hyaluronic acid, ethanol, and the like. [0240] The term \"pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle\" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient or carrier with which a compound of the disclosure is administered. The terms \"effective amount\" or \"pharmaceutically effective amount\" refer to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the agent to provide the desired biological result. That result can be reduc\u00ad tion and/or alleviation of the signs, symptoms, or causes of a disease, or any other desired alteration of a biological system. An appropriate \"effective\" amount in any individual case can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation. [0241] \"Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers\" for thera\u00ad peutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sci\u00ad ences, 18th Edition (Easton, Pa.: Mack Publishing Company, 1990). For example, sterile saline and phosphate-buffered saline at physiological pH stabi\u00ad lizers, dyes and even flavoring agents can be provided in the pharmaceutical composition. For example, sodium benzoate, sorbic acid and esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid can be added as preservatives. Id. at 1449. In addition, antioxidants and suspending agents can be used. Id. [0242] Suitable excipients for non-liquid formulations are also known to those of skill in the art. A thorough discussion of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and salts is avail\u00ad able in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition (Easton, Pa.: Mack Publishing Company, 1990). [0243] Additionally, auxiliary substances, such as wetting or emulsifying agents, biological buffering substances, sur\u00ad factants, and the like, can be present in such vehicles. A biological buffer can be any solution which is pharmacologi\u00ad cally acceptable and which provides the formulation with the desired pH, i.e., a pH in the physiologically acceptable range. Examples of buffer solutions [0244] Depending on the intended mode of administration, the pharmaceutical compositions can be in the form of solid, semi-solid or liquid dosage forms, such as, for example, tab\u00ad lets, suppositories, pills, capsules, powders, liquids, suspen\u00ad sions, creams, ointments, lotions or the like, preferably in unit dosage form suitable for single administration of a precise dosage. The compositions will include an effective amount of the selected drug in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, in addition, can include other pharma\u00ad ceutical agents, adjuvants, diluents, buffers, and the like. [0245] In general, the compositions of the disclosure will be administered in a therapeutically effective amount by any of the accepted modes of administration. Suitable dosage ranges depend upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated, the age and relative health of the US 2015/0150878 Al 11Jun. 4, 2015 subject, the potency of the compound used, the route and form of administration, the indication towards which the adminis\u00ad tration is directed, and the preferences and experience of the medical practitioner involved. One of ordinary skill in the art of treating such diseases will be able, without undue experi\u00ad mentation and in reliance upon personal knowledge and the disclosure of this application, to ascertain a therapeutically effective amount of the compositions of the disclosure for a given disease. [0246] Thus, the compositions of the disclosure can be administered as pharmaceutical formulations including those suitable for oral (including buccal and sub-lingual), rectal, nasal, topical, pulmonary, intramuscular, intra-arterial, intrathecal, subcutaneous and intravenous) administration suitable for admin\u00ad istration by inhalation or insufflation. The preferred manner of administration is intravenous or oral using a convenient daily dosage regimen which can be adjusted according to the degree of affliction. [0247] For solid compositions, conventional nontoxic solid carriers include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of man\u00ad nitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talc, cellulose, the like. Liquid pharmaceutically administrable composi\u00ad tions can, for example, be prepared by dissolving, dispersing, and the like, an active compound as described herein and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in an excipient, such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, etha\u00ad nol, and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension. If desired, the pharmaceutical composition to be administered can also contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary sub\u00ad stances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pFl buffering agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sorbitan monolaurate, triethanolamine sodium acetate, triethanola\u00ad mine oleate, and the like. Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art; for example, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, referenced above. [0248] In yet another embodiment is the the composition will gen\u00ad erally take the form of a tablet, capsule, a softgel capsule or can be an aqueous or nonaqueous solution, suspension or syrup. Tablets and capsules are preferred oral administration forms. Tablets and capsules for oral use can include one or more commonly used carriers such as lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. Typically, the compositions of the disclosure can be combined with an oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable, inert carrier such as lactose, the like. More\u00ad over, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, and coloring agents can also be incor\u00ad porated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such glycol, waxes, and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, mag\u00ad nesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium the like. Disintegrators include, without limita\u00ad tion, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite, xanthan gum, and the like. [0250] When liquid suspensions are used, the active agent can be combined with any oral, non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water, and the like and with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, flavoring, coloring and/or sweetening agents can be added as well. Other optional components for incorporation into an oral formulation herein include, but are not limited to, preservatives, suspending agents, thickening agents, and the like. [0251] Parenteral formulations can be prepared in conven\u00ad tional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solubilization or suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions. Preferably, sterile injectable suspensions are formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable carriers, dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable formulation can also be a sterile injectable solution or a suspension in a non\u00ad toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solu\u00ad tion. In addition, sterile, fixed oils, fatty esters or polyols are conventionally employed as solvents or suspending media. In addition, parenteral administration can involve the use of a slow release or sustained release system such that a constant level of dosage is maintained. [0252] Parenteral administration includes intraarticular, injection which can contain and solutes that render the for\u00ad mulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. Administration via certain parenteral routes can involve introducing the formulations of the disclosure into the body of a patient through a needle or a catheter, propelled by a sterile syringe or some other mechanical device such as an continuous infusion system. A formulation provided by the disclosure can be administered using a syringe, injector, pump, or any other device recog\u00ad nized in the art for parenteral administration. [0253] Preferably, sterile injectable suspensions are formu\u00ad lated according to techniques known in the art using suitable carriers, dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable formulation can also be a sterile inject\u00ad able solution or a suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer's solu\u00ad tion and isotonic sodium chloride solution. ile, fixed oils, fatty esters or polyols are conventionally employed as solvents or suspending media. In addition, parenteral administration can involve the use of a slow release or sustained release system such that a constant level of dos\u00ad age is maintained. [0254] Preparations according to the disclosure for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non- aqueous solutions, suspensions, or emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents or vehicles are propylene glycol, poly\u00ad US 2015/0150878 Al 12Jun. 4, 2015 ethylene glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil and corn oil, gelatin, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Such dosage forms can also contain adjuvants such as pre\u00ad serving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. They can be sterilized by, for example, filtration through a bacteria retaining filter, by incorporating sterilizing agents into the compositions, by irradiating the compositions, or by heating the compositions. They can also be manufactured using ster\u00ad ile water, or some other sterile injectable medium, immedi\u00ad ately before use. [0255] Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorpo\u00ad rating one or more of the compounds of the disclosure in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of prepa\u00ad ration are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any addi\u00ad tional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. Thus, for example, a parenteral composition suitable for administration by injection is prepared by stirring 1.5% by weight of active ingredient in 10% by volume pro\u00ad pylene glycol and water. The solution is made isotonic with sodium chloride and sterilized. [0256] Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure can be administered in the form of supposito\u00ad ries for rectal administration. These can be prepared by mix\u00ad ing the agent with a suitable nonirritating excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at the rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols. [0257] The pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure can also be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well- known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and can be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, propellants such as fluorocarbons or nitrogen, and/or other conventional solubilizing or dispersing agents. [0258] Preferred formulations for topical drug delivery are ointments and creams. Ointments are semisolid preparations which are typically based on petrolatum or other petroleum derivatives. Creams containing the selected active agent, are, as known in the art, viscous liquid or semisolid emulsions, either oil-in-water or water-in-oil. Cream bases are water- washable, and contain an oil phase, an emulsifier and an aqueous phase. The oil phase, also sometimes called the \"internal\" phase, is generally comprised of petrolatum and a fatty alcohol such as cetyl or stearyl alcohol; the aqueous phase usually, although not necessarily, exceeds the oil phase in volume, and generally contains a humectant. The emulsi\u00ad fier in a cream formulation is generally a nonionic, anionic, cationic or amphoteric surfactant. The specific ointment or cream base to be used, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, is one that will provide for optimum drug delivery. As with other carriers or vehicles, an ointment base should be inert, stable, nonirritating and nonsensitizing. [0259] Formulations for buccal administration include lozenges, and the like. Alternatively, buccal admin\u00adistration can be effected using a transmucosal delivery system as known to those skilled in the art. The compounds of the disclosure can also be delivered through the skin or muscosal tissue using conventional transdermal drug delivery systems, i.e., transdermal \"patches\" wherein the agent is typically con\u00ad tained within a laminated structure that serves as a drug delivery device to be affixed to the body surface. In such a structure, the drug composition is typically contained in a layer, or \"reservoir,\" underlying an upper backing layer. The laminated device can contain a single reservoir, or it can contain multiple reservoirs. In one embodiment, the reservoir comprises a polymeric matrix of a pharmaceutically accept\u00ad able contact adhesive material that serves to affix the system to the skin during drug delivery. Examples of suitable skin contact adhesive materials include, but are not limited to, polyethylenes, polysiloxanes, polyisobutylenes, polyacry\u00ad lates, polyurethanes, and the like. Alternatively, the drug- containing reservoir and skin contact adhesive are present as separate and distinct layers, with the adhesive underlying the reservoir which, in this case, can be either a polymeric matrix as described above, or it can be a liquid or gel reservoir, or can take some other form. The backing layer in these laminates, which serves as the upper surface of the device, functions as the primary structural element of the laminated structure and provides the device with much of its flexibility. The material selected for the backing layer should be substantially imper\u00ad meable to the active agent and any other materials that are present. [0260] The compositions of the disclosure can be formu\u00ad lated for aerosol administration, particularly to the respira\u00ad tory tract and including intranasal administration. The com\u00ad pound will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of 5 microns or less. Such a particle size can be obtained by means known in the art, for example by microni- zation. The active ingredient is provided in a pressurized pack with a suitable propellant such as a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) for example dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluo- romethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. The aerosol can conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug can be con\u00ad trolled by a metered valve. Alternatively the active ingredi\u00ad ents can be provided in a form of a dry powder, for example a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropyl- methyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidine (PVP). The pow\u00ad der carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition can be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of e.g., gelatin or blister packs from which the powder can be administered by means of an inhaler. [0261] A pharmaceutically or therapeutically effective amount of the composition will be delivered to the subject. Theprecise effective amount will vary from subject to subject and will depend upon the species, age, the subject's size and health, the nature and extent of the condition being treated, recommendations of the treating physician, and the therapeu\u00ad tics or combination of therapeutics selected for administra\u00ad tion. Thus, the effective amount for a given situation can be determined by routine experimentation. For purposes of the disclosure, generally a therapeutic amount will be in the range of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 250 mg/kg body weight, more preferably about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, in at least one dose. In larger mammals the indicated daily dosage can be from about I mg to 300 mg, one or more times per day, more preferably in the range of about 10 mg to 200 mg. The subj ect US 2015/0150878 Al 13Jun. 4, 2015 can be administered as many doses as is required to reduce and/or alleviate the signs, symptoms, or causes of the disorder in question, or bring about any other desired alteration of a biological system. When desired, formulations can be pre\u00ad pared with enteric coatings adapted for sustained or con\u00ad trolled release administration of the active ingredient. [0262] The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged prepa\u00ad ration, the package containing discrete quantities of prepara\u00ad tion, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.

During any of the processes for preparation of the subject compounds, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules con\u00ad cerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional pro\u00ad tecting groups as described in standard works, such as J. F. W.McOmie, \"Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry\", Plenum Press, London and NewYork 1973, in T. W. Greene and P G. M.

Example I\u2014Cells [0288] 293FT cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Cell gro) supplemented with L-Glutamine Sodium Pyruvate and 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS). The cells were used for preparation of SARS-CoV, Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, and VSVG VSVG transiently transfected with the human ACE2 expression plasmid for the SARS-CoV pseudot\u00ad yped viruses entry inhibition experiments discussed below. Example 2\u2014 Synthesis of Viral and Host Proteins Derived Peptides That Contain the Natural Cathepsin L Cleavage Sites [0289] The cathepsin L in glyco\u00ad proteins of SARS-CoV, EBOV, NiV and HeV zoonotic viruses were identified as conserved elements. Peptides (10 amino acids long), derived from the glycoproteins of SARS- CoV, EBOV, HeV, NiV, the host pro-neuropeptide Y (pro- NPY) and the host peptide F (Pep F) that contain the naturally conserved CatL cleavage sites, were synthesized in the pro\u00ad tein research laboratory at UIC (FIG. I). The peptides con\u00ad tained the natural cathepsin L cleavage sites in the viral pro\u00ad teins and host pro-NPY. The viral and host pro-NPY derived peptides were labeled on the N-terminus with 5-Carboxytet- ramethylrhodamine (Tamra) as a quencher and on C ter\u00ad minus by 5-Carboxyfluorescein (5-FAM) as an emitter in the protein research laboratory at UIC. The labeled peptides were purified using reversed phase High performance Liquid Chro\u00ad matography (HPLC) in the UIC protein research laboratory. [0290] The cleavage products for the labeled and unlabeled peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry in the UIC protein research laboratory. The SARS-CoV-S, EBOV-GP, HeV-F0, NiV-F0, the host pro-NPY, and Pep F derived labeled and unlabeled peptides (I pM) were incu\u00ad bated with I pg/mlofhumancathepsinLpurifiedfromhuman liver (Sigma Aldrich) for I hour at room temperature in ammonium acetate buffer pH 5.5 containing 4 mM EDTA and 8 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). [0291] If the peptide was not cleaved, no fluorescence emission was detected at 535 nm when FAM was excited at 485 nm due to the quenching effect of Tamra. In contrast, if the peptide was cleaved by CatL, an emission of light at 535 nm was detected. See FIG. 6. The four viral derived peptides and the host derived peptides were found to be cleaved at the expected sites by Mass Spectrometry ((FIGS. 2-5). All the US 2015/0150878 Al 16Jun. 4, 2015 labeled peptides were similarly cleaved by CatL confirming that the fluorophores did not affect the CatL mediated cleav\u00ad age (FIGS. 7-11). Example 3\u2014Optimization of the High Throughput Screening Assay (HTSA) [0292] The HTSA is a Fluorescence Resonance Energy (FRET) based assay. The labeled SARS-CoV S pro\u00ad tein derived peptide was used as a substrate in the primary screen. The assay was optimized in black 384 well plates (Thermoscientific) using 3 pM SARS-CoV-S derived labeled peptide incubated with I pg/ml human cathepsin L (Sigma Aldrich) and further optimized with I pM SARS-CoV-S derived labeled peptide incubated at room temperature with 0.25, 0.5, and I pg/ml catL in 50 pi total volume OfNH4Ac buffer pH 5.5 supplemented with 4 mM EDTA and 8 mM DTT. The fluorescence was measured over time, at 535 nm after excitation at 485 nm, using fluorescence reader at the UIC HTS facility. The EBOV GP, HeV and NiV F0 derived labeled peptides as well as the host pro-NPY and Pep F derived peptide were tested for cleavage concentration by incubation I pM of each peptide with different concentrations of cathepsin L (0.25, 0.5, and I pg/ml). The rate of the reac\u00ad tion was measured based on the slope. The quality of the screening assay (Z factor) was determined using the follow\u00ad ing formula: Z-factoi=l-(3(ai,+a)/lpp-pl), where CT^=Standard deviation of the positive signal, a=standard deviation of the negative signal, p^=mean of the positive signal, and pJ I=mean of the negative signal. Z-Factor between 0.5 and I means an excellent screening assay. [0293] The labeled SARS-CoV derived peptide was cleaved by CatL and the cleavage was measured in the form of increased fluorescence over time with no increase in fluores\u00ad cence in CatL untreated peptide (FIG. 12A). The different viral peptides showed different rates of cleavage in a dose dependent manner with the host peptides, particularly the host pro-NPY derived peptide, cleaved at a higher rate than the viral derived peptides (FIG. 12B). The validity of the assay was determined based on the Z-factor calculation. Accordingly, the Z-factor was calculated for the differentpeptides incubated with 0.5 pg/ml CatL after stopping the reaction with 0.5M acetic acid. The Z-factor was found to be between 0.5 and I which supports the validity of the HTSA of small molecules that can inhibit the CatL mediated cleavage of the peptide substrates. Example 4\u2014HTS of Small Molecules Library Identifies Potential Inhibitors of CatL Mediated Cleavage [0294] Primarily, a library of 5000 small molecules, at 40 pM concentration, from ChemBridge Corporation was tested in duplicates (in black 384 well plates) for inhibition of cathe\u00ad psin L mediated cleavage of labeled SARS-CoV-S derived peptide in 50 pi total reaction volume using the same buffer as mentioned above. The assay was performed with I pM of the peptide incubated with 0.25 pg/ml catL at pH 5.5 for 45 minutes at room temperature after which the reaction was stopped by 10 pi of 0.5M acetic acid. The fluorescence was read using fluorescence reader at the UIC HTS facility. The percentage inhibition of the cathepsin L mediated cleavage by the screened compounds was calculated using the following formula: positive fluorescence signal in absence of com- pounds-fluorescence signal in presence of compoundsxlOO/ positive fluorescence signal in absence of compounds-nega- tive fluorescence signal in absence of the enzyme. The top 50 hits that inhibited the cathepsin L cleavage of SARS-CoV peptide at a cutoff of inhibition screened dupli\u00ad cates for the inhibition of cleavage of EBOV-GP, HeV, and NiV-F0 as well as cleavage of pro-NPY derived labeled pep\u00ad tides as mentioned before. [0295] Fifty compounds, out of the 5000 compounds screened, were identified to inhibit the CatL cleavage of SARS peptide at a cutoff of 60% inhibition calculated based on the fluorescence signal obtained in the absence of the inhibitors (0% inhibition) (Table I ). The validity of the HTSA was further confirmed by calculating the Z-factor using the positive and negative means as well as positive and negative standard deviations. The Z-factor value was found to be 0.61 which confirms our previously calculated Z-factor and ensures that the assay is excellent for HTS of inhibitors of CatL cleavage of the peptide substrates (Table 2).

For the production of HIV/AE, only HIV vectors were used for transfection. For HeV and NiV pseudotyped viruses, pCAGGs expression plasmids coding for G (15 pg) and F protein (5 pg) of HeV or NiV were transfected along with HIV vectors as described above. The media were changed the following morning and the superna\u00ad tants were collected 24 and 48 hrs later and pooled. The virus stocks were frozen at -80\u00b0 C. until used. Example 6\u2014HTSA Selected Inhibitors Showed Differential Inhibition to Pseudotyped Virus Entry [0297] The top 50 hits, which showed inhibition of catL cleavage of SARS-CoV derived peptide, were then tested for US 2015/0150878 Al 18Jun. 4, 2015 inhibiting the cleavage of the other viral derived peptides (EBOV, HeV, NiV) and the host pro-NPY derived peptide. (Table 3) Twelve compounds out of 50 showed inhibition to the cleavage of all viral peptides with minimal inhibition of 10% while showing lower inhibition of the pro-NPY derived peptide cleavage (Table 4).

The virus or virus/compounds mixtures were added to 2xl05 293FT/well seeded in 6 well plates. For the viruses reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty four hours later, the cells were transduced with the SARS-CoV-S pseudotyped virus treated or untreated with the candidate compounds. Seventy two hours later, the cells were lysed and the luciferase expression was determined using luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufactur\u00ad er's instructions. [0299] For HeV and NiV, the compound 5705213 and its derivative 7402683 were used at final concentration of 100 pM during both pseudotyped viruses preparation and trans\u00ad duction. The cathepsin L inhibitor, Z-Phe-Tyr-CHO (Calbio- chem, Cat. No. 219402) at 10 pM concentration, was used as a positive control and DMSO treated viruses as a negative control. [0300] The percentage entry inhibition of the candidate compounds on different pseudotyped viruses was calculated using the following formula: (L(mock treated - vims) - L(ZZZVAEVirus) [0301] Nine compounds out of 12 identified from the HTSA, that showed higher inhibitions of viral peptide cleav\u00ad age while minimally inhibiting the pro-NPY derived peptide were tested for inhibiting the SARS-CoV-S and EBOV pseudotyped viral entry. Four compounds out of the 9 uncolored compounds were found to inhibit EBOV, and SARS-CoV pseudotyped viruses simultaneously (FIG. 19). These compounds were assigned I.D. numbers by Chem- bridge Corporation (7910528, 7914021, 5705213, and (FIG. 24). compound 30.3% inhibitions to EBOV to EBOV and viruses Compound showed to EBOV 2015/0150878 Al 19Jun. 4, 2015 CoV viruses respectively while compound 5182554 60.45% and 49.3% inhibitions to EBOV and SARS-CoV viruses respectively. Other compounds surprisingly enhanced SARS-CoV-S pseudot\u00ad yped viral entry. Derivatives of different compounds were tested of which only compound 7402683 showed higher inhi\u00ad bition than its parent compound and 68.3% inhibitions to EBOV and SARS-CoV-S pseudotyped viruses respectively) (FIG. 19). The DMSO treated cells did not show inhibition of the pseudovirus entry. Similarly, the entry of VSV-G pseudotyped viruses was not affected by any of the compounds. These results show the specificity of the com\u00ad pounds at the indicated concentration towards viruses that utilize the CatL for entry into the target cells. Example 7\u2014ElTSA Selected Inhibitors Showed Differential Inhibition to Pseudotyped Virus Entry [0302] MTT based cell cytotoxicity assay was performed at different time points to test whether the EBOV and SARS- CoV pseudotyped virus entry inhibition was due to specific effects of the tested compounds or due to an undesirable effect on cell viability and proliferation. [0303] 293FT cells were seeded at density of IO4 cells/well in 96 well plates. The following day, the cells were treated with different concentrations (10, 30, 50, and 100 pM) of the selected compounds and the cytotoxicity effect of the com\u00ad pounds was assessed using MTT reagent (3-(4,5-Dimeth- ylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (Roche) for 3 days according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly at 24, 48, and 72 hrs following addition of each com\u00ad pound, the cells were washed once with Phosphate buffered Saline (PBS) and fresh DMEM medium without phenol red was added (100 pl/well) after which 10 pi of MTT reagent was added to each well and incubated for 4 hrs at 37\u00b0 C. 100 pi of 10% SDS solubilized in 0.01M FlCl was added to each well with vigorous mixing and further incubated for 4 hrs at 37\u00b0 C. The OD was measured at 595 nm and the percentage viability was calculated relative to the control after subtract\u00ad ing the background. [0304] Compounds 7914021 and 5182554 were found to be toxic to the cells at concentrations of 10 pM and above over 3 days of incubation with 293FT cells. The cytotoxic effect was dramatic for the 2 compounds at concentrations above 10 pM after I day of incubation with 293FT cells (20-100% cyto\u00ad toxicity). This cytotoxicity increased over the next 2 days even at 10 pM concentration (FIG. 25A). In contrast, the compound 5705213 did not show a significant cytotoxic effect (cell viability over 80%) on the 293FT cells at 10-100 pM concentration range over 3 days ofincubationwith293FT cells (FIG. 25A). Similarly, the derivative 7402683 showed similar pattern with no significant cytotoxicity over 3 days. This confirms the specific inhibitory effect of the compound 5705213 and its derivative on EBOV and SARS-CoV pseudotyped viruses. [0305] To further ensure the specific inhibitory effect of the compounds on the viruses that utilize CatL for entry, the VSV-G pseudotyped virus was treated with different concen\u00ad trations of the 5705213 compound and its derivative and the luciferase activity was measured 72 hrs post-transduction. Ebola-GP and SARS-CoV-S pseudotyped viruses were mixed with the compounds 5705213 and7402683 at different concentrations (1-160 pM). Themixturewas added to 293FT cells seeded at density of 2xl05 cells/well in 6 well plates (In case of SARS-CoV-S pseudotyped viruses, cells were tran\u00adsiently transfected with human ACE2 expression plasmid (pcDNA3.1) 24 hrs prior to transduction). Seventy two hours later, the cells were lysed and the luciferase expression was determined using luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of each compound was plotted against the percentage inhibition of viral entry and the concentration of the compound that inhib\u00ad its the viral entry by 50% (IC50) was determined from the curve. [0306] The compounds did not show any significant inhibi\u00ad tory effect on the entry of VSV-G pseudotyped virus even at concentrations up to 100 pM (FIG. 25B). The 5705213 showed an IC50 of 15 pM and 9 pM against EBOV and SARS-CoV-S pseudotyped virus respectively. The derivative showed higher potencies with IC50 of 10 pM and 6 pM against and SARS-CoV-S pseudotyped virus respec\u00ad tively. Example 8\u2014Compound Inhibit the in vitro CatL Mediated Cleavage of SARS-CoV-S-Flag Recombinant Protein [0307] To further test the inhibitory effect the com\u00ad pounds 5705213 and 7402683, SARS-CoV-S-flag recombi\u00ad nant protein was in coli BL21 cells. [0308] SARS-CoV-S ectodomain (amino acids 12-1184) was amplified using pcDNA3.1-S expression plasmid expressing full length SARS-CoV-S protein as a template. The forward primer with 5' 6x Flis tag-Nhe-I and a reverse primer with 5' Flag-BamFlI were used in the PCR reaction. The PCR product was digested with NheI and BamHI (New England Biolabs) independently and cloned into petl lib bacterial expression vector. The recombinant plasmid with His-S-Flag DNA was transformed into DE3 BL21 cells. The transformed cells were induced with I mM IPTG at OD=O.8 for 2 hrs after which the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (80 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.006% bromophenol blue, and 15% glycerol). The protein expression was detected by coomassie staining following separation on 4-15% SDS/PAGE gel and confirmed by western blot using monoclonal anti-flag mouse antibody (Sigma Aldrich) and secondary anti-mouse HRP conjugated antibody (Promega). The His-S-Flag inclusion bodies was purified, dissolved in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer with 8M urea pH=8.8. The protein was GSH, and 0.5 mM GSSG). [0309] Purified recombinant SARS-CoV-S protein was incubated with 2 pg/ml cathepsin L in NH4 acetate buffer pH=5.5, containing 4 mM EDTA and 8 mM DTT, for 4 hrs in absence and in presence of increasing concentrations of the compound 5705213 and its derivative 7402683. The cleavage of the protein was detected by western blot using anti-flag mouse monoclonal antibody (SigMA Aldrich). [0310] There was a dose dependent cleavage of the recom\u00ad binant SARS-CoV S-flag protein by Cat L (FIG. 21A). There was a dose dependent inhibition of the Cat L mediated cleav\u00ad age of SARS-CoV-S-flag protein by the compounds 5705213 (FIG. 21B) and 7402683 (FIG. 21C) with the concentrations tested (10 to 320 pM). US 2015/0150878 Al 20Jun. 4, 2015 Example 9\u2014Compound 5705213 and Its 7402683 Iinhibit the Endogenous Processing of Nipah and Eiendra Fusion Proteins and the Entry of Pseudotyped Viruses [0311] Next, the inhibitory effect of the compound 5705213 and its derivative 7402683 was tested on the endog\u00ad enous processing of NiV and EieV F0 proteins in 293FT cells transiently expressing the fusion proteins. [0312] 293FT cells were plated at a density of 200,000 cells/well in 6 well plates. The cells were transfected with Nipah or Fiendra virus using transfection reagent (Qiagen) then treated with the inhibitors (5705213 and its derivative 7402683) at 100 pM concentration 4 hrs post-transfection. The cathepsin L inhibi\u00ad tor was used as a control at 10 pM concentration. The cells were lysed 48 hrs later and F0 processing was determined by western blot using cross reactive anti-Nipah and Fiendra F protein monoclonal antibody. F0 represents uncleaved fusion protein while F1 is the fusion subunit of the F0 protein. [0313] Both compounds were able to efficiently inhibit the endogenous cleavage by CatL when compared to the inhibi\u00ad tion seen with the commercial cathepsin L inhibitor (FIGS. 22A & 22B). The two compounds as well as the control (cathepsin L inhibitor) inhibited the entry of FieV and NiV pseudotyped viruses into 293FT cells with entry inhibitions of 80 to 100% (FIG. 22C). As expected, the VSV-G pseudot\u00ad yped virus entry was unaffected by the compounds (FIG. 22C). Example 10\u2014SARS-CoV-S PseudotypedVirus Entry Inhibition Is More Dramatic By a Combination of the Cmpound 5705213 and the Protease Inhibitor In [0314] SARS-CoV pneumocytes by transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2) expressed on the cell surface or CatL in the late endosomes (Simmons G, et ah, 2005, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102:11876-81; Shulla A, et al., 2011, J Virol. 85(2):873-82; Matsuyama S, et al., 2010, J Virol. 84(24): 12658-64). Therefore, the inhibition of SARS-CoV infection would be optimum when using a combination of protease inhibitor and CatL inhibitor. Thus, the entry of the SARS- CoV-S pseudotyped virus into 293FT expressing either the receptor (ACE2) or the receptor plus different amounts of the TMPRSS2 was tested. [0315] 293FT cells were plated at a density of 200,000 cells/well in 6 well plates. The 293FT cells were transfected with the human SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 plasmid only (I pg) or the receptor plus increasing CoV pseudotyped virus, quantified using HIV-1 p24 Elisa kit (Express Biotech International, MD), 24 hrs post-transfec- tion. HIV/AE virus which does not express the SARS-CoV S protein was used as a negative control of entry. The entry was quantified by measuring the luciferase expression in cell lysates 72 hrs post-transduction in terms of Relative Light Units (RLU). The entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV into 293FT cells, transfected with either the receptor only (ACE2 plasmid) or receptor plus 10 ng of TMPRSS2 plasmid, was measured in presence or absence (mock) of different inhibi\u00ad tors. Camostat (Calbiochem, Cat.No. 219402). All the inhibitors were used at 10 pM concentration. [0316] There was a significant increase in pseudotyped virus entry in cells transfected with 10 ng of the TMPRSS2 plasmid, relative to the entry in cells with no TMPRSS2 expression, which decreases upon increasing the amount of the TMPRSS2 plasmid transfected (FIG. 26A). This may be due to unspecific proteolytic effects of the high concentration of the TMPRSS2 protease. [0317] Next, the inhibitory effect of protease inhibitor (Camostat) and a combina\u00ad cells expressing the SARS-CoV recep\u00ad tor, human ACE2, with or without the expression of the mem\u00ad brane protease TMPRSS2 (10 ng) was tested. The the commercial CatL inhibitor unlike the pro\u00ad tease inhibitor were able to inhibit the entry by 50 and 60% respectively in absence of the TMPRSS2. The inhibition was found to combination of CatL inhibitor+protease inhibitor respectively (FIG. 26B). This suggests that the identified inhibitor 5705213 may be used in combination with the commercial protease inhibitor to com\u00ad pletely block SARS-CoV natural lung 5705213 is a Mixed Inhibitor For Cathepsin L [0318] In order to determine the mechanism of action of the identified inhibitor, an enzyme kinetics assay based on Michaelis-Menten and NiV-F0 derived labeledpeptide (2-64 pM) with fixed concentration of cathepsin L (0.5 pg/ml) in absence or presence of 5705213 compound for 40 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with 10 pi of 0.5M acetic acid after which the fluorescence was read, at 535 nm after excitation at 485 nm, with the fluorescence reader at UIC HTS facility. The reaction was performed in 50 pi total volume in 384 well plates using NH4 acetate buffer pH5.5 supplemented with 4 mM EDTA and 8 mM DTT. The Velocity of the reaction at different substrate concentrations was calculated (Fluorescence units/minute) and plotted versus substrate concentration. The inverse veloc\u00ad ity was further plotted versus inverse substrate concentration (Lineweaver-Burk plot) from which the Km and Vm ax were calculated. [0320] Lineweaver-Burk plot provides a graphical way for analysis of the Michaelis-Menten equation: V=Vm ax [S]/Km + [S], taking ax [S]=Km / Vm ax-1 /[S]+1 INmax which is the equation for the Lineweaver- Burk plot, where V is the reaction velocity (the reaction rate), Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant, Vm ax is the maximum reaction velocity, [S] is the substrate concentration, and Km Arm ax is the slope. From the Lineweaver-Burk plot, it was found that there was an increase of Km and a decrease in Vm ax in presence of the inhibitor compound 5705213 whicICh is dose dependent (FIG. 23). This suggested that the identified compound is a mixed inhibitor based on currently established kinetics.
