Powerful and influential factors in various disciplines - social, economic, cultural and scientific, as well as in technological domains - have created pressure on the health- care industry to deliver high quality and efficient healthcare services. Adoption of a new generation of technologies in the health field, specif- ically electronic health records (EHR) and digitized healthcare services (e- Health) has arisen to meet some of the needs of healthcare systems to achieve some of the following objectives : reduction of preventable medical errors and risk for healthcare ser- vices, for clinical decision support, and for clinical knowledge manage- ment systems ; connection of healthcare provid- ers to patients' lifetime healthcare records when needed ; empowerment of citizens for main- tenance of their health and well- being - which requires a personal health record (PHR) ; emphasizing security, confidential- ity and privacy protection of indi- vidual health information during its communication and integration. In order to accomplish the suc- cessful adoption of healthcare informa- tion technology (HIT), in particular EHR, healthcare information systems require interoperability. Standardization in the field of HIT helps achieve compatibility and interoperability between systems and ensures compatibility of data for compar- ative statistical purposes - for example, classification - and reduces duplication of effort and redundancies. A major objective of standard- ization is to agree on definitions of the information to be communicated that are specific to various healthcare uses in Dr. Yun Sik Kwak, Chair, ISO/ TC 215, Health informatics\" Standardization in the field of HIT helps achieve compatibility and interoperability between systems and ensures compatibility of data...\" Dr. Yun Sik Kwak, order to enable communication nation- ally and internationally. A very large amount of information with a compli- cated structure needs to be modelled in a manner, which recognizes mul- tiple existing paradigms of care and encourages best practice. ISO/TC 215 relates to health- care services and the information systems influencing standards devel- opment and standards on EHR data structure, data interchange, security, medical terminologies, healthcards, EHR and pharmacy-related business requirements and medical device information interoperability. Stakeholders include healthcare organizations and providers, industrial suppliers, payers of private and public healthcare, as well as national govern- ments with responsibility for health planning, standard setting, evaluation and monitoring. Additionally, univer- sity health systems and research bod- ies are important, given their integral connection with and contribution to the healthcare systems. And since all individuals are potential patients at some stage in life, every citizen has a concern for the effectiveness of the healthcare service system. ISO/TC 215 supports national standards bodies in developing coun- tries by providing advisory services to their ISO members and enhancing their participation by promoting HIT. The costs for standardization of health informatics are difficult to cal- culate, but it should be noted that some 30 % to 50 % of all working hours of providers is used for information man-agement of the USD 500 billion spent on health care in Europe. Today, this is largely managed manually through paper documentation, but it is easy to see the potential for savings, if a modest one percent of communication carried out through standardized HIT amounts to USD 2 billion a year. New systems built on standards for interoperability create new opportu- nities for building solutions for health- care services in addition to the wide- ly proven messaging and communica- tion standards. It should be recognized that factors such as literacy and politi- cal stability affect the development of efficient and quality healthcare pro- grammes as well as the introduction and use of HIT. Sharing data can facilitate shar- ing information across and amongst geographies, health systems and pro- viders/professions to enable the delivery of efficient patient care and the devel- opment of clinical and health systems' knowledge and saving of costs. Additionally, the efficient exchange of information provides other benefits, such as enhancing information exchange supporting academic and research initia- tives to develop solutions and enabling and facilitating the provision of ongo- ing educational requirements of health- care providers. ISO Focus February 2007 1ILAC and IAF 2006 General Assemblies and joint meeting The International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) held their annual meetings in Can- cun, Mexico in November 2006. An important decision was tak- en in a joint meeting related to the initiation of a multilateral recognition arrangement (MRA) for inspection bodies, which will complement the MRAs already operated by ILAC for testing and calibration laboratories and by IAF for product certification and man- agement systems certification. All these MRAs reference the corresponding ISO/IEC stand- ards developed by CASCO, ISO's Conformity Assessment Committee. ISO 170 11:2004 relating to requirements for accreditation bodies is now widely implemented by IAF and ILAC members. A deci- sion was taken concerning a transition period of two years for the implementation of the recently adopted ISO 17021:2006 (requirements for certification bodies of manage- ment systems). United Nations Climate Change Conference At the UN Climate Change Con- ference in Nairobi, Kenya, 6-7 November 2006, decisions were taken to mitigate climate change and help countries adapt to global warming. The conference was attended by 6 000 participants, including more than 100 minis- ters and the former Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan. Agreement was reached on the Adaptation Fund under the Kyoto Protocol, which draws on proceeds generated by the clean development mechanism (CDM) to support adaptation activities in developing countries. Industrialized countries can gen- erate tradable emission credits by investing in projects in devel- oping countries to reduce green- house gas emissions. Rules were finalized for the Special Climate Change Fund for projects in developing coun- tries for adaptation, technology transfer, climate change, miti- gation and economic diversifi- cation for countries dependent on income from fossil fuels. The first JCDCMAS Event A seminar-workshop, \" Capacity Building in Metrology, Accredi- tation and Standardization in the Andean Region, from the perspec- tive of Bilateral and Regional Free Trade Agreements \", was held in Lima, Peru, 23-25 Octo- ber 2006 , organized by UNIDO, which currently chairs the secre- tariat of the Joint Committee coordinating assistance to devel- oping countries in Metrology, Accreditation and Standardiza- tion (JCDCMAS), together with the secretariat for the Andean Community and the National Institute for the Defense of Competition and Intellectual Property (INDECOPI). Politicians, academics and the business community listened to directors and experts from the international organization members of the JCDCMAS, including the secretary of ISO/CASCO. A workshop was also conducted for officials from the Andean Community member countries working in metrology, accredi ta- tion and standardization, and production and trade to identify the technical needs at a national level and in the Andean Commu- nity, which will be useful for financial and technical assistance. Contact : dev-t@iso.org International Standardization Summit of Japan Prof. Masami Tanaka, ISO Pres- ident, was invited to attend the \" International Standardization Summit of Japan,\" held at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), Tokyo, Japan, on 29 November 2006. The summit was host- ed by Minister Akira Amari of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, and involved the top management of various leading com pa- nies in Japan, including Toyota, Canon, Toshiba, and Mitsubishi Electric. Minister Amari opened the summit by stating that he had long argued for the importance of inter na- tional standardization and encouraged the business leaders to build upon their activities. Participants agreed on the importance of developing new International Standards for emerging technologies. They emphasized the importance of Japanese participation in inter- national standardization activi- ties at ISO and IEC, with the industrial sector as a main play- er of international standardiza- tion. Minister Amari announced METI's plans for a more focused resource allocation to key fields, better education and training of standardization experts, and the enhancement of cooperation within the Asia- Pacific region.Universal Postal Union Conference The Universal Postal Union (UPU) Strategy Conference held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates , 14-16 Novem ber 2006, served to broaden the out look of the postal world and provide a clearer picture of its future role. It emphasized that interconnec- tion and develop ment of the world postal network can help combat social, financial and technological exclusion. Dis- cussions focused on the impor- tance of postal sector reform and regulation, the role of the sector as a gateway to new technologies, the ability of the post to provide electronic fund transfer services, the impor- tance of standards in har moniz- ing exchanges of international messages, and the need to ensure that development cooper- ation takes account of the actu- al needs of countries, especial- ly the least developed ones. The ideas and solutions pre- sented in Dubai will be used to formulate the next World Postal Strategy at the Nairobi Congress in 2008. The conference was attended by close to 800 dele- gates from 122 countries. In his presentation, ISO Secre- tary-General Alan Bryden high- lighted the potential for reinforcing the collaboration between UPU and ISO in various areas such as data processing and exchange, quality management , security in the supply chain, IT security, fi- nancial services and conformity assessment, especially in relation to the certification of postal serv- ices, incl uding the exchange of postal messages.

ISO President visits Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) During the visit of ISO President Prof. Masami Tanaka to BIS in New Delhi 6 November 2006, a workshop was organized on issues related to international standardization and WTO, attended by high level represent- atives of industry, regulators, ministry officials, senior BIS officials and other stakeholders. Mr. S. P. Sharma , the then Director General of BIS, welcomed Prof. Tanaka and workshop participants, pointing out that International Standards can be used as a technical barrier to trade, hence the importance to understand the critical role of standards and conformity assess- ment procedures . In his presentation, Prof. Tanaka highlighted the importance of international standardization and the ISO strategic plan for Mexico to raise its profile in international standardization The visit to Mexico in November of ISO Secretary-General Alan Bryden to Direcci\u00f3n General de Normas (DGN), ISO's Mexican member, aimed to raise awareness about International Standards for this major emerging economy. Mexico has many trade agree- ments, including the USA, the EU and Japan, and is a signato- ry to WTO Agreements. Mr. Bryden's visit included contacts with industry, public authorities and the media. At a conference attended by 500 participants representing all sectors of the Mexican economy and the Mexican Parliament, highlights were a formal welcome message to ISO and a meeting with the members of its Commissions for Economic Affairs and for Federalism (see photo below) . improving participation from developing countries. He appreciated the role played by India in ISO and its lead in implementation of manage- ment system standards. The importance of the participa- tion of Indian industry into ISO activities was emphasized as well as the need to strengthen cooper- ation with the South Asian Asso- ciation for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). ISO course on enhanced participation in interna- tional standardization A three-day training course hosted by the South African Bureau of Standards (SABS) in Pretoria, 14-16 November 2006 was the fifth in a series of pilot courses on enhanced participa- tion in international standardi- zation funded by the ISO/DIN Endowment with the support of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB). Twenty- five participants from Botswa- na, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Ken- ya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozam- bique, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe attended.

Horst Siebold has been the Head of Standardisation & Technology at Siemens Medical Solutions since 1998. He is responsible for technical cooperation with standardization bodies and industry associations and for coordination of strategic technology management and patent management. After completing his Ph.D. in Darmstadt in solid state physics in 1979, he joined the Siemens Corporate Research Lab in Erlangen and from 1994 to 1998, he headed the Imaging Technologies Laboratory in Siemens Medical Solutions. Dr. Siebold is a member of the board of the German Society for Biomedical Engineering (DGMBT) and a member of the Advisory Group to the German Ministry for Education and Research on biomedical engineering (MTA).

ISO Focu s : How do International Standards of the type produced by ISO and IEC play a role in the dissemina- tion of innovation in health technolo- gies? Horst Siebold : First of all, standards and innovation do not contradict each other. In all markets medical equipment needs regulatory approval and must ful- fil essential requirements for the safety needs of the population and the govern- mental regulatory bodies. The standards then translate these legal texts into more tangible technical requirements based on the current technology. This leaves enough room for the creativity of individual engineers and scientists to find ways to fulfil these requirements in an economic way or even supersede them driven by \" Siemens Medical Solutions has implemented an Environmental, Health and Safety Management System for all its manufacturing and sales sites worldwide.\" 4 ISO Focus February 2007about the specific patient out of the data already available in the hospital (patient history, lab values, medica- tion, images, etc.) if stored electroni- cally and in a standardized way. Here, standardization must even be the precursor of product devel- opment. The vision of a personal life- long health record is not conceivable without standards. ISO Focu s :What kind of networks and partnerships in standardization do you think are important in order to help address some of the challenges facing the medical sector ? Horst Siebold : Making standards is a collaborative exercise per se . To make them successful, involvement of the key stakeholders, i.e. the prospective users, is essential. For quality management and safety standards, these are primarily the regulators - many of them with a legal background who must be certain that they can rely on the efficacy of a \" Together with our healthcare partners, we have proven that enhancing the quality of patient care and reducing costs are not contradictory goals. On the contrary : By combining innovative medical technologies and powerful IT for process optimization we can enhance efficiency in healthcare dramatically.\" Erich R. Reinhardt, President and CEO, Siemens Medical Solutions\u00a9 Siemens AGthe competition in the market. In mid- term cycles of five years, the progress in science and technology is then fed back into the standards portfolio in a review process. This provides a successful bal- ance between the consolidation of proven concepts into standards and an unleashed stride for researching and implementing new ideas, similar to what the genomic code and muta- tions do for the evolution of life. International Standards bundle the needs of the different national reg- ulatory systems. Showing conformity to these accelerates and/or eases the market approval process. They provide a solid base on which to develop prod- ucts, suitable for a global market, as medical devices can be used in vari- ous countries more easily than other products like cars for instance. Innovative software applications - such as clinical decision support in a hospital - help the physician to keep his orders consistent to established medical guidelines and avoid medical errors. This application extracts rele- vant infor- mation \u00a9 Siemens AG ISO Focus February 2007 5Guest View standard to ensure safety for patients and users. For clinical information stand- ards, medical doctors are the main stakeholders. Only they know what technical or clinical detail is relevant and what procedures are practicable. This clinical knowledge must then be transformed into a language which soft- ware engineers in the companies under- stand. Unfortunately only few doctors have the time and the budget to engage in standardization bodies. Horst Siebold : Quality management according to ISO 13485 is a precon- dition for market access for medi- cal device manufacturers worldwide - except in the United States - and is implemented throughout Siemens. It is a cornerstone of the regulatory frame- work for safe medical devices which is regularly audited by technical bod- ies such as the Technischer \u00dcberwa- chungsverein (T\u00dcV) and the British Standards Institution (BSI). We are currently working on a fully integrated Quality and Process Management System, using a Sie- mens-wide internal industrial process framework as a platform. Siemens Medical Solutions has developed and implemented an Environ- mental, Health and Safety Management Partners from universities are needed for providing theoretical insight and concepts of current science. Also certification bodies must contribute to formulating the standards in a way that makes them practicable for test- ing procedures if demanded by nation- al regulations. From our experience, collabo- ration in standardization between dif- ferent companies is excellent in the medical device industry. Strategies are aligned in industry associations 1). Safety standards are seen as a means for a fair competition and for setting adequate barriers for companies who might play foul by delivering cheap, but unsafe products. The investment into the writ- ing of clinical information standards does not provide a substantial com- petitive edge; however, all companies benefit from the market growth for clinical information technology (IT), which happens only when standards are implemented.ISO Focu s :How do you see Interna- tional Standards helping to facilitate better healthcare in developing coun- tries and bridge the \"Health Divide\"? Horst Siebold : International Standards make the present knowledge in medical technology publicly available as does the scientific literature on life sciences - reaching also those countries that do not yet have the resources to contribute. Of course, developing countries must select what level of healthcare they can afford. But this challenge will soon come to the wealthy countries, too with aging popula- tions. We expect to see more high-tech products in the future, which will be affordable for devel- oping countries. ISO Focu s : In addition to ISO standards direct- ly related to the medical field, does Siemens emphasize quality man- agement systems like ISO 9001, and its sector application for medical devices ISO 13485, as well as environ- mental management systems such as ISO 14001 for its medical products operations?Siemens Medical Solutions of Siemens AG is one of the world's largest suppliers to the healthcare industry.

It is consistent with the international ISO 14001 standard and incorporates elements of other internationally rec- ognized occupational health and safe- ty management system standards. It is designed to support internal processes and reduce costs and risks. ISO Focu s : Given the challenges fac- ing the medical sector, can you describe the areas in which you believe stand- ardization can play an important role in the future, such as clinical evaluation development of diagnostic technologies, quality of health services both in the home and in institutions, electronic health services i.e. patient healthcares, telehealth ; and what further improve- ments can be made in the development of standards for the medical sector ? Horst Siebold : Already today the admin- istrative processes in a hospital and some fundamental clinical workflows are described within the IHE (Integrat- ing the Healthcare Enterprise) initiative sponsored by clinical user associations 2) and supported by industry. The IHE framework describes in detail how to apply and constrain estab-registries, personal health data reposi- tories, drug information systems. The huge upfront investments are a high barrier because the benefits can only be estimated, especially the impact on medical quality and the reduction of medical errors. Each statutory insti- tution owns only a part of the overall health care process from prevention, ear- ly detection and diagnosis, over therapy to home care. None of them is respon- sible for the complete process, so there is no main stakeholder who sits in the driver seat and creates an eHealth busi- ness framework opening a market for standards-based products. Once there is a market the refinement of still immature standards will grow by itself. lished clinical information standards such that information can be exchanged auto- matically between software applications of different vendors (interoperability). The clinical decision processes and medical guidelines, also called \" clinical pathways \", are still much less standardized; this is the fundamental mission of highly specialized medi- cal professional societies. To evaluate multi-centre clinical studies it is still necessary to define detailed rules on how to perform the studies i.e. imag- ing protocols, etc. More and better accepted stand- ards for quality of health service pro- vision are highly appreciated by citi- zens and by the industry. This would encourage more competition between healthcare providers to deliver higher quality which subsequently would lead to higher investment in technology. In many countries national pro- grammes are now underway to stimulate the electronic transfer of health data. Depending on the political culture and history, there are different priorities. For example Germany drives the health card standardization and deployment, whereas Canada and the United King- dom drive the deployment of common services and applications, e.g. provider 2) RSNA (Radiological Society of North America) and HIMSS (Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society)To conclude, international stand- ards for medical products and technol- ogies fulfil the needs of regulators and industry very well. However, standard- ardization regarding the provision of healthcare is still in its infancy - be it terminology, clinical pathways or quality metrics - and is hampered by different cultural heritages. It is still open how to convince more medical doctors to con- tribute their practical experience to the standards development process. These standards would then serve as the founda- tion for a wealth of new products bring- ing their benefits to the main stakeholder - us, the patients and citizens. \u00a9 Siemens AG\u00a9 Siemens AG ISO Focus February 2007 7Main Focus With millions of dental prod- ucts sold worldwide, the development of internation- al dental standards is important to assure the safety and quality of those products.

Jones obtained his B.Sc. and Ph.D. from the Univer- sity of Birming- ham, United Kindgom, sor Emeritus of Biomaterials, Dalhousie Uni- versity, Canada. He has been involved with standards development for the past 36 years. He is currently Chair of ISO/TC 106 for the term of 2005-2010, and was Secretary of ISO/TC 106/SC 1, Dental filling and restorative materials , from 1979 to 1997, and Chair of ISO/TC 106/ SC 1 from 1998-2005. He is a Chartered Chemist (C.Chem) and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry (FRSC), the Institute of Ceramics (F.I.Ceram), Institute of Materials (FIM) and Biomaterials Science and Engineering (FBSE). He has done research on a wide range of material properties and has authored and co- authored over 290 papers and abstracts and written sections in eight books. He holds two patents on biomaterials and has received numerous awards for his work in the dental field.Lying back in the den- tal chair, illuminated by a dental light, with the sound of the drill and the suction equipment, the patient's thoughts are no doubt far away from the ISO stand- ards for the equipment and materials which ensure the quality and safety of the procedure. However, more than 20 ISO dental standards involving definitions, codes and designations, materials and equipment are used for the place- ment of a jacket crown on a front tooth. An ISO designated system shows the location of each tooth in a dental chart and shaping the crown requires a vari- ety of instruments conforming to ISO standards. In addition to performance standards, an extensive coding system is used to classify rotary instruments with limits for bore sizes and dimen- sions for discs, wheels and cutting burs. ISO standards cover the materi- als used to create a replica of the area of the mouth to facilitate production of a metal cap with a ceramic veneer fused onto its surface, which simulates a natural tooth. These materials are evaluated for biocompatibility according to ISO standards and the metal used has to conform to the standard for corrosion. Cement is then used to fix and seal the crown in place. Dental standardization Dental standardization consists of diverse stakeholders such as den- tal professionals, dental manufactur- ers, government healthcare regulato- ry agencies and the consumer - the patient. ISO/TC 106 provides a forum for the dental industry, for profession- al bodies, academic dentistry and con- sumers - to produce standards govern- ing the practice of dental treatment and the manufacture of reliable and safe products. Participation by stakeholders in the development of dental standards generates an information flow between manufacturers, the dental profession, and government regulators. Consumers may not general- ly be aware of the existence or the details contained in the 156 ISO den- tal standards that have been produced to enhance the quality of their den- tal treatment, but these are important given that some 90 % of the popula- tion worldwide suffers at some time in their lives from dental disease requir- ing clinical treatment and a high pro- portion use oral hygiene products. In developed countries, oral health is improving with a decline in dental caries, particularly in children. But because people are living long- er, increased retention of teeth has resulted in greater demand for den- tal treatment. Modern dentistry is greater in scope and has more possibilities than in the past with less removal of tooth structure by drilling and by the use of adhesive aesthetic fillings, periodontal care, root canal therapy and minor surgery, orthodontics and implants. The scope of ISO/ TC 106 is likely to increase in the future to cover areas such as tissue engineering tissue scaffolding and bone growth. The ISO portfolio contains a total of around 16 500 voluntary standards with participation of about 50 000 experts. In dentistry, ISO/TC 106 has 46 member countries (25 actively partici- pating and 21 observing) that have produced 156 standards. In addition some 40 or more new and revised standards - with input and par- ticipation from close to 300 interna- tional dental experts from the mem- ber countries - are in the process of being developed. Dentistry thus represents about 1 % of all of ISO's work, even though about 90 % of the world population \" The dental industry market is a lucrative and highly competitive market, globally estimated at approximately 10 billion euros annually.\"\"Put your standards where your mouth is\" . ISO Focus February 2007 9Main Focus requires dental treatment and the use of oral healthcare products. The dental industry The market is relatively small in relation to that for healthcare in gener- al, but it is a lucrative and highly com- petitive market, globally estimated at approximately 10 billion euros annu- ally, with the consumable product seg- ment totaling 8.6 billion euros. Excluding equipment, the glo- bal market is estimated to be grow- ing at 4.5 % to 5.9 % annually, which amounts to an annual growth of 470 to 550 million euros.In developed countries, typically the ratio is about one dentist to 2 000 to 3 000 people. However, in some devel- oping countries there may be only one dentist to over a million people. In developed countries, the dai- ly use of fluoride toothpaste and a tra- dition of brushing teeth is common practice. In many developing coun- tries however, although toothbrush- es and toothpaste conforming to ISO standards are often available in urban areas through western multi-nationals and national suppliers they are simply too expensive for the poor. Traditional teeth cleaning meth- ods such as chewing sticks or twigs and natural remedies like ash are bet- ter than nothing, but cannot compare with fluoride toothpaste. ISO/TC 106 has recently initi- ated the revision of the ISO standard for toothpaste to address the question of bulk containers used for supervised tooth brushing programmes in schools and public health programmes in devel- oping countries. Cooperation with EU ISO's dental standards commit- tee works closely with the European Union, illustrated by the fact that a total of 123 ISO Standards were accepted as EN ISO Standards by the Europe- an Standards Committee CEN/TC 55 as of August 2006. ISO/TC 106 also collaborates with the World Dental Federation (FDI) and the World Health Organi- zation (WHO). ISO/TC 106 has seven active sub- committees and over 40 working groups. The following list gives an overview of the complexity and scope of the work undertaken by ISO/TC 106 : Working Group 10 , Biological eval- uation , evaluates biocompatibility of medical devices and test methods for dental materials. The scope of work covers safety for both patients and healthcare personnel. Cytotox- icity tests are used to evaluate cell response to materials. Tests are also conducted for materials used for fill- ings and dentures. Subcommittee 1 , standards mate- rials, mercury and alloys dental amalgams, corrosion of amalgam alloys, resin-based filling materi- als, pit and fissure sealants, luting cements, bases and liners and resin- based cements, adhesion test meth- ods and standards for orthodontic wires, elastics and brackets. The market for oral hygiene products in the USA alone reached over three billion euros in 2000 and the best-selling tooth bleaching brand in the US market had sales of 130 mil- lion euros in 2004, up 5.2 % from the previous year. There are 10 major internation- al dental companies with annual sales ranging from 200 million to 1.7 billion euros. The rest of the industry is made up of 3 500 to 4 000 smaller compa- nies worldwide. Around 600 000 dental implants are used annually throughout the world. The implant industry is made up of about four or five large compa- nies and around 200 smaller manufac- turers. The worldwide dental implant market in 2005 was about one billion euros and is estimated to grow to 2.4 billion euros by 2010. The number of people employed in the dental manufacturing and sup- ply industry is estimated to be between 40 000 and 60 000 and there are between 700 000 and 800 000 dentists through- out the world, although the number of dentists per capita varies widely in different regions. \" ISO/TC 106 provides a forum for the dental industry, for professional bodies, academic dentistry and consumers .\" Subcommittee 2 , Prosthodontic materials , develops and maintains standards for dental ceramics, gold and base metal casting alloys, braz- ing materials, impression materi- als, denture resilient lining materi- als, denture base polymers, corro- sion test methods, wear test meth- ods, colour stability tests, polymer veneers, die materials, dental wax and crown and bridge materials. Subcommittee 3 , Terminology , pro- duces standards for terms and defi- nitions in both English and French for use in standards developed by ISO/TC 106 and all its subcommit- tees. Standardized terms have been adopted or are being developed for use by the working groups, including a standardized designation system for teeth and areas of the mouth, as well as a system of codification and classification of dental products. Subcommittee 4 , Dental instruments , produces standards for bur dimen- sions, rotary instruments, number- ing systems for instruments, graph- ic symbols, hand instruments, root canal and periodontal instruments, dental syringes, and injection nee- dles. Subcommittee 6 , Dental equipment , develops standards for the patient chair, the dental unit, the operator's \" Mercury pollution from dental offices is estimated to be about 0.04 % to 0.2 % of the total environmental mercury pollution worldwide.\" 10 ISO Focus February 2007stool, dental lights, water and air supply to the dental unit and suction equipment, as well as standards for amalgamators, amalgam dispens- ers, amalgam capsules, amalgam traps and powered polymerization activators for hardening resin fill- ing materials. Subcommittee 7 , Oral care prod- ucts, works on standards dealing with manual and electric toothbrushes, as well as oral hygiene products such as oral rinses, dental flosses, and tooth whitening products, in addition to the requirements, test methods and labeling for toothpastes containing fluoride. Subcommittee 8 , Dental implants , works developing various docu- ments dealing with implants: eval- uation of dental implant systems, materials for bone filling and bone augmentation in maxillofacial sur- gery. Dental implants can replace missing teeth; however, a suitable volume of bone at the implant site is required and needs to be first eval- uated by use of X-ray equipment and radiographic images produced by a system that meets the appro- priate ISO standard . ISO/TC 106 has taken over responsibility for international dental standards from the World Dental Fed- eration (FDI) and has been in exist- ence since 1963. In 2004, the Cana- dian Dental Association (CDA) took over responsibility for the Secretariat of ISO/TC 106 from the British Stand- ards Institution (BSI). Dental standards and the environment ISO/TC 106, Dentistry , is specif- ically addressing environmental issues with the development of a standard for amalgam traps for waste, a responsibil- ity that has been fully recognized and supported by the dental profession. The release of amalgam particles into waste water is of particular con- cern, as this discharge can contribute to mercury in the environment. Mercu- ry pollution from dental offices is esti- mated to be about 0.04 % to 0.2 % of total environmental mercury pollution worldwide. In most countries, the den- tal profession, manufacturers and gov- ernment agencies agree on the need for the use of amalgam traps which meet the requirements of ISO 11143, Dental equipment - Amalgam separators . The future programme The technical committee has established an ad hoc group to review the future scope of the work programme of ISO/TC 106, which currently cov- ers standardization of terminology and methods of test and specifications appli- cable to materials and equipment used in all branches of dentistry. The ad hoc group is giving great- er emphasis to the criteria for perform- ance thresholds and the longevity of restorative materials, as well as the use of imaging systems software and clin- ical record-keeping software. The group also looks at ques- tions of consumer safety and product effectiveness. In accordance with ISO strategies, environmental issues are also examined in the development of dental standards and, in accordance with ISO procedures, any change in the scope of ISO/TC 106 has to be approved by the ISO Technical Management Board. Conclusions In future there will be great- er emphasis on the performance and quality of dental products based on consumer needs, testing methods, ter- minology, and properties that ensure safety and reliability. Several thousand dental products are manufactured and exported worldwide ; ISO standards are a major factor in facilitating interna- tional trade in dental products. Developed countries have a responsibility to play a role in the development of International Stand- ards in this vital area. Dental stand- ards play a vital and important role in society by contributing to the quality and safety levels of products used in dental treatments and by the general public. ISO/TC 106 is addressing the needs of the current and future stand- ardization of products and considers ISO standards a necessary requirement for the dental profession and patients worldwide. Dental standards are a serious matter but they can put a smile on your face.Amalgam filling in a tooth. ISO Focus February 2007 11World of Health IT Conference by Audrey Dickerson, Secretary of TC 215, Health informatics Close to 2 000 people attended the first World of Health IT Con- ference and Exhibition held in Geneva, Switzerland from 10-13 Octo- ber 2006. The event drew speakers, par- ticipants and exhibitors from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) to discuss the benefits and val- ue of technology in healthcare. The main organizers of this event include the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS), the European Commission (EC) and the World Health Organization (WHO). About HI MSS The Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) is the healthcare industry's membership organization exclusively focused on providing global leader-ship for the optimal use of healthcare information technology (IT) and man- agement systems for the betterment of healthcare . \" The World of Health IT Conference bridges the gap between public policy and the realities of day-to-day implementation.\"through its advocacy, educational and professional development initiatives designed to promote information and management systems' contributions ensuring quality patient care. The role of ISO/TC 215 The role of ISO/TC 215 is to facilitate standardization in the field of information for health and health Information and Communications Technology (ICT) to achieve compat- ibility and interoperability between independent systems. ISO/TC 215 also aims to ensure compatibility of data for comparative statistical purposes (e.g. classifications) and to reduce duplication of effort and redundancies. The prime objective of ISO/TC 215 activities is to contribute to the improvement and maintenance of health by producing those ISO standards which the interna- tional community regards as necessary to enable the successful utilization of ICT in the health environment. The healthcare sector is large and complex with many different applica- tion requirements. A major objective of standardization is to agree on definitions of the information to be communicated that are specific for various healthcare HIMSS supports standards work ; including various standards developers and consortia - in the USA, Health Informatics Technology Standards Panel (HITSP) and, inter- nationally, Integrating the Health care Enterprise (IHE) - and is the current secretariat-delegate for ISO/TC 215, Health informatics . Founded in 1961, with offices in Chicago, Washington D.C., Brussels, and other locations across the United States and Europe, HIMSS represents more than 20 000 individual members and over 300 corporate members that collectively represent organizations employing millions of people.

A former critical care nurse with an adult health nursing masters, she accepted the role of ISO/TC 215 secretary in 2003, when the secretary position was del- egated to HIMSS. In the secretary role, she has rejuvenated the US Technical Advisory Group (TAG) with 50 members, assisted with a technical committee reor- ganization and is a working team member of two Global Summit committees.uses to enable communication nation ally and internationally. Maintenance of health is an important political objective of all countries. Political decisions have great impact on the organization of healthcare including investments in information technology. In many countries there are important goals to ensure good quality health services for all citizens. Enhanced information exchange supports academic and research ini- tiatives in developing solutions and enables and facilitates ongoing edu- cational requirements of healthcare providers. HIMSS and ISO/TC 215 Four years ago, HIMSS offi- cially assumed the roles of Secretariat for ISO/TC 215, Health informatics, and administrator of the United States technical advisory group (US TAG), a mirror group making decisions on US positions on standards developed in ISO/TC 215. The standards developed in ISO/TC 215 interact with all areas of healthcare, but focus primarily on Health Informatics. The committee meets twice per calendar year : once in formal plenary session with resolu- tions determining the direction of the work programme and once in informal joint work group session. Currently, 20 countries are participating members with 21 countries in observer status. HIMSS provides leadership and support for global activities, including the Global Summits, the first a discus- sion of National Health Information Networks by 11 different countries held in Hamamatsu City Japan and the second, held in Geneva, a dialogue between the standards developers and international vendors who use stand- ards. A third Summit is to be held on 25 March 2007 in Montreal, Canada, focused on clinicians.designed for and by the healthcare IT community in the EMEA region - be they technology users, buyers, vendors, providers or healthcare regulators. Addressing the perspectives of clinicians, directors and other healthcare professionals, The World of Health IT Conference and Exhibition offered educational sessions, vendor exhibi- tions, best practice exchange network- ing sessions and other professional development opportunities.

Jorgensen, Donald M. Powers and Klaus E. Stinshoff In memory of Desmond Kenny, Convenor of Working Group 1 of ISO/TC 212, who died on 18 December 2006. ISO/TC 212 was established in 1995 to promote quality and safety in medical laboratory testing and develop International Standards for medical laboratories and in vitro diag- nostic (IVD) manufacturers. The scope of TC 212 is comprised of WG 1, Qual- ity and competence in the medical lab- oratory ; WG 2, Reference systems ; WG 3, In vitro diagnostic products ; and WG 4, Antimicrobial susceptibil- ity testing . WG 1, Quality and competence in the medical laboratory The most important project of WG 1 is ISO 15189:2003, Medical lab- oratories - Particular requirements for quality and competence . This standard addresses both quality management and accreditation aspects because medical laboratories work concurrently in the commercial and public domains. There- fore, agreement and cooperation from TC 176 (quality management) and CASCO (conformity assessment) were essential to give medical laboratories confidence that if they based their work on this doc- ument, they could obtain both certifi- cation and accreditation. After intense discussions, a cooperative three-party agreement was reached. ISO 15189:2003 has become the basis for accreditation of medical laboratories in many countries. Con- sequently, such success has generat- ed pressure to review and update the standard frequently. WG 1 is current- ly working on a major revision, form- ing a series of standards that will inte- grate additional laboratory manage- ment topics like safety and risk man- agement, some of which are covered now in separate standards. 14 ISO Focus February 2007About the authors Dr. Ren\u00e9 Dybkaer , M.D., Dr. Med.

These stand- ards were developed in order to ensure the accuracy of quantitative measure- ment procedures, so that, ideally, a patient would be able to obtain the same result in every laboratory in the world within the measurement uncer- tainty of the measured quantity val- ue. The work was done in collabora- tion with its sister and namesake in the European Committee for Standardiza- tion (CEN), TC 140/WG 4.atic effects producing variability and to combine them, based on a measure- ment model, to give a value for meas- urement uncertainty. Unfortunately, the GUM is not an easy text. The detailed procedure is suitable for a metrology institute, but is beyond the resources of routine medical laboratories. The remedy chosen by WG 2 is to assemble the effects in groups such as those from intraindividual variation, sampling, calibration, and intermedi- ate measurement precision. They are usually assessed anyway during vali- dation of the measurement procedure and can be expected to apply for meas- urements in statistical control.The project will provide procedures con- sistent with the GUM, but replace its detailed bottom-up approach by a sim- plified approach involving the group- ing of individual contributions to the measurement uncertainty and submit- ting them to a combining algorithm. This approach will be demonstrated in examples. The challenge to WG 2 is to strike the right balance between theory and practice. 1) ISO 17511:2003, In vitro diagnostic medical devices - Measurement of quantities in biological samples - Metrological traceability of values assigned to calibrators and control materials 2) ISO 18153:2003, In vitro diagnostic medical devices - Measurement of quantities in biological samples - Metrological traceability of values for catalytic concentration of enzymes assigned to calibrators and control materials 3) ISO 15193:2002, In vitro diagnostic medical devices - Measurement of quantities in samples of biological origin - Presentation of reference measurement procedures 4) ISO 15194:2002, In vitro diagnostic medical devices - Measurement of quantities in samples of biological origin - Description of reference materials 5) ISO 15195:2003, Laboratory medicine - Requirements for reference measurement laboratories 6) ISO/WD TS 25680 (2006), Medical laboratories - Estimation and expression of measurement uncertainty 7) ISO Guide 98:1995, Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (GUM)To continue the pursuit of this goal, WG 2 has recently begun work on a new project, Medical laboratories - Estimation and expression of measure- ment uncertainty ,6) also in collaboration with its CEN counterpart.

Strictly speaking, meaningful comparison of a measured value with other values is impossible without tak- ing into account their reliability, as indi- cated by their measurement uncertain- ty.

Although ISO 14971 has been highly successful in promoting safer medical devices, many in vitro diag- nostic manufacturers found the risk management principles difficult to apply to their products. The main reason is that the risk to a patient from failure of an IVD medical device is indirect - that is, a product's failure would cause a laboratory error, which could then mislead a physician to a diagnosis or treatment that has the potential to harm the patient. The cas- cade from Figure 1 of the ISO 14971 annex describes the risk scenario for a typical IVD medical device. Among the challenges the IVD risk management guidance had to address were how to determine which device failures could create serious hazards to patients, e.g., by contribut- ing to an incorrect or delayed labora- tory examination value ; how to esti- mate the probability and the severity of the patient harm that could result ; and how to reduce and control the risks. Given the diversity of IVD products, the guidance provides manufacturers with detailed \" points to consider\" rath- er than a fixed approach. WG 4, Antimicrobial susceptibility testing WG 4 has been presented with an important opportunity to define a global reference method for antimi- crobial susceptibility testing of aero- bic bacteria and criteria for accepta- ble performance of antimicrobial sus- ceptibility testing devices. WG 4 has worked closely with a parallel work- ing group of CEN to develop the two standards. The international reference method is based on the broth micro- dilution test described by the Clini- cal and Laboratory Standards Insti- tute (CLSI) and the European Union Committee on Antimicrobial Suscep- tibility Testing (EUCAST). The first of the two documents, Reference method for in vitro testing of the susceptibility of antimicrobial agents against aerobic bacteria involved in infectious diseases ,13) was published in November, 2006 after unanimous vote of participating members. The second document, Eval- uation of performance of antimicro- bial susceptibility testing devices 14) was approved at the DIS level, and is being prepared for its final FDIS vote. It outlines specifically how an evalu- ation should be organized, how many bacterial strains need to be tested, and strict methods for evaluating and cate- gorizing the study results that include direct comparison to the ISO reference method. The document is intended to provide guidance for use by device manufacturers and by regulatory bod- ies for registration of a device for mar- keting in a country or region. Summary ISO/TC 212 has published 15 standards, many of them considered groundbreaking by laboratories, regu- lators and manufacturers. A key to the success of ISO/TC 212 has been the way this committee cooperates with other committees and institutions. By actively seeking this cooperation, devel- oping mechanisms of sharing respon- sibilities in drafting, reviewing and voting, and reaching pragmatic yet technically sound compromises, ISO/ TC 212 has been able to improve our own standards and contribute to the quality of others. We believe that this approach represents a good model for sharing the work, the responsibilities and ultimately the success of interna- tional standards. ISO Focus February 2007 17Main Focus Risk management of medical devices - A new era for standardization by Alfred M Dolan, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, and Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto The provision of safe and effec- tive devices for patients and health care users is the basis for medical device standards and regula- tion the world over. To this end, work on the standard, ISO 14971:2000, Medical devices - application of risk management to medical devices, was initiated more than a decade ago. Starting with basic risk manage- ment concepts developed over the past 400 years, the standard was adapted to meet the needs of the medical devices sector, and it has become the defini- tive benchmark for medical devices throughout the world. The standard has been approved as a European norm and a Japanese industrial standard, as well as a nation- al standard in other countries. Interna- tional medical devices regulatory bod- ies now incorporate requirements that are either included in that standard or are consistent with it, effectively con- stituting a mandate. Since the publication of ISO 14971:2000, hundreds of medical device standards have incorporated the requirements of ISO 14971 through referencing the standard, incorporat- ing requirements of specific clauses of the standard, or requiring the standard be met in whole or in part. Thus ISO 14971 has very quick- ly become the worldwide standard for risk management for medical devic- es and is a key element in the regula- tion of medical devices for assurance of safety and effectiveness. This rep- resents a new era for medical device standardization. Medical device standardization Standardization in the medi- cal devices sector has long implicit- ly recognized risk. However, for the most part, that consisted of recogni- tion of a hazard, and, if it was deter- mined that the resultant harm to the user was serious enough, setting of requirements to eliminate or minimise the harm that might ensue. Two spe- cific examples may be cited: One is the hazard surrounding the misconnection of anaesthetic cir-cuits. Various national and interna- tional standards committees, most notably ISO committees, determined that the harm resulting from such misconnection was so serious that requirements were developed spec- ifying sizes and tapers for different parts of the circuit between the anaes- thetic machine and the endotrache- al tube. The result of this mitigation has been a marked increase in safety for the patient. A second example stems from the hazard of electric shock. Since the time of Hoffa and Ludwig, and later Prevost and Batelli, it has been known that electric shock could produce phys- iologic effects on the heart and ven- tricular fibrillation. 18 ISO Focus February 2007About the autho r Alfred M. Dolan is the convenor of the Joint IEC/ ISO Working Group on Appli- cation of Risk Management to Medical Devices. This committee, working within the technical commit tee on quality management, has published Standard ISO 14971, Risk man- agement for medical devices , which is the International Standard in this area. He is immediate Past Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Association for Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. He has many years of experience in the healthcare field across North America, progressing from research in the thoracic and cardiovascular field to clinical manage- ment and finally to healthcare programme management and teaching. He has been the Samuel Lunenfeld Professor and Graduate Coordinator for the Clinical Engineering Program at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto, since its inception in 1984. He is COTA Fellow at the Virginia Polytech- nic Institute and State University, which is establishing a thrust in risk management in the healthcare sector.Subsequent work over the past 150 years has shown that microshocks at very low levels could initiate ven- tricular fibrillation. Consequently, standardization work centred on devel- oping requirements to limit the amount of current that could be inadvertent- ly delivered to a patient by a medi- cal device. This has had the effect of virtually eliminating the incidence of microshock. Whilst recognition of risk by standards committees in technical and performance standards has been successful, there is also a recognition that absolute safety is unachievable, so it became important to establish a broader, more explicit approach to the management of risk in medical devic- es. With that broad approach has come a new era for medical device stand- ardization. Risk management The two issues that drove the initial development of risk manage- ment for medical devices were the lack of standardization in the use of risk concepts and a great increase in technological application and sophis- tication. However, the in creased sophisti- cation of the patient care environment, as well as the hardware and software incorporated in medical devices, impos- es increasing demands upon medical device manufacturers and the users of those devices. As that complexity and the sophistication of the medical device environment in hospitals has Firstly, the importation of risk concepts into medical device stand- ards and regulations was inconsistent and in many cases inaccurate. Terms such as risk control, risk analysis, risk assessment and hazard analysis were all used interchangeably, even in reg- ulations intended to define safety and efficacy of medical devices. The first task was to adopt recognized concepts that had been developed since the times of Galileo and Bernoulli and to apply them appropriately to the med- ical devices field. Secondly, for some 40 years, par- ticular medical device product stand- ards had implicitly identified hazards associated with a particular device and had, if the risk of harm developing from a hazard was considered significant, incorporated requirements within the standard to minimise the risk. Require- ments for leakage current limitations on medical devices or the requirement for specific connectors on breathing circuits as cited above are examples. This has been highly successful, and certainly the need for those technical standards remains. increased, it has become more diffi- cult to identify how individual events may work in combination to possibly produce harm to the patient. In the simple example of one device and one hazard, say electric shock, one can show that the possible combinations of events are calculable. As the number of devices in the envi- ronment increases to three, the number of possible combinations may increase more than 500 times. An overall risk management approach as is incorporated in ISO 14971 is required. Recen tly the Health- care Technology Task Force of the World Standards Cooperation further emphasized this point, strongly sup- porting the risk management approach for medical device standards. \" The virtually universal adoption ISO 14971 has greatly enhanced the safety and efficacy of medical devices.\" ISO Focus February 2007 19Main Focus ISO 14971:2000, Medical devices - Application of risk management to medical devices Starting in 1994, the working group considering risk management for medical devices began the devel- opment that matured to become the standard ISO 14971:2000, Medical devices - Application of risk man- agement to medical devices . It is designed first and foremost as a man- agement standard covering all medi- cal devices over the entire life cycle of the device. The standard builds on well- established risk management principles developed over hundreds of years, as well as on the work of other interna- tional risk standards, and it provides a process for manufacturers of med- ical devices. All the basic principles of risk management apply for medi- cal devices; the standard provides a management system which must be in place and specifies that the steps of hazard identification, risk estima- tion, risk evaluation, and risk control must be included in any manufactur- er's risk management process. Management responsibility is identified as the initial - and the key - requirement for successful manage- ment of risks. The senior management of the manufacturer is required to : establish a specific risk management process, which includes defined ele- ments, including analysis, evalua- tion and control of risks, as well as post-production monitoring ; provide adequate resources for the risk management team ; establish the policy for establish- ing risk acceptability criteria ; provide appropriate personnel to carry out the process ; and review the process on a regular basis. For each medical device, there is a requirement that a risk manage- ment plan be developed in accordance with the risk management process noted above. A critical component of the plan includes setting the level of acceptable risk for that device, based on the policy for risk acceptability pre- viously established by management. The plan will describe how each ele- ment of the risk management process is to be achieved for that device. Records provide information, upon which effective management of risk is based. Specified records are gen- erated at the analysis, evaluation, and control stages of the process. Records may or may not be incorporated and controlled within the requirements of an existing recordkeeping function of a quality management system. Ongoing monitoring of risk management is incorporated in a requirement for generating post-mar- ket information. This step involves set- ting up a systematic way of review- ing informa tion generated during in- service experience, and then moving it into a feedback process. This information is useful in the review of the effectiveness of the risk control measures throughout the life cycle of the device, and may serve as a basis for modification of the risk analysis or evaluation. Moreover, this information will serve as an impor- tant reference for the development of future risk management plans. This standard then provides the basis for the new era in the use of risk management throughout the rest of medical device standardiza- tion activities. International harmonization Harmonization in the application of ISO 14971 as the medical device risk management standard has devel- oped rapidly in international regula- tory activity but particularly through international standardization. In the international medical device regulatory environment, the use of ISO 14971 currently varies with the regulatory authority. It is a European Standard, and can therefore be used in meeting medical device requirements in Europe. In Japan, it is a Japanese Industrial Standard and will there- fore form part of the medical device regulations through the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. In North America, the standard is a recognized standard by the FDA but not required by US Food and Drug Administration regulations. Rather, in regulations, risk management has been implicit in the design require- ment of 21 C.F.R., section 820.30 and in the preamble to the Quality Sys- tem Regulation. At the international level, ISO 14971 has been incorporated or inte- grated in various ways throughout hundreds of medical device stand- ards. This is arguably the most effi- cient and effective method of harmo- nizing risk management concepts for medical devices. Throughout third edi- tion of IEC 60601-1 on Medical Elec- trical Equipment, ISO 14971 is spe- cifically cited in hundreds of clauses. The opening requirements clause of 20 ISO Focus February 2007that standard specifies that the proc- ess required in ISO 14971 be in place by the manufacturer of the medical electrical equipment. The standard also is cited in requirements or referenced in specific clauses in other standards, covering such diverse areas as programmable medical electrical systems (IEC 60601- 1-2) ; usability (IEC 60601-1-06) ; bio- logical evaluation of medical devices (ISO 10993-18) ; clinical investi gation for human subjects (ISO 14155) ; car- diac valve prosthesis (ISO 5840) ; and anaesthetic equipment. Conclusion Risk management through ISO 14971 has provided a platform for manufacturers of medical devic- es to effectively manage risks asso- ciated with the devices they produce. At the same time it has provided a vehicle for regulatory oversight to help ensure the safety and efficacy of medical devices through implemen- tation strategies within the mandate of those agencies. Finally, the virtually univer- sal adoption and adaptation of ISO 14971 for inclusion within medical device technical and performance standards has meant an overwhelm- ing incorporation of ISO 14971 into medical device standardization activ- ities around the world. This has had the effect of greatly enhancing the safety and efficacy of medical devic- es, which is the goal of standardiza- tion efforts. ISO has been a leader in opening up this new era.Telehealth - Extending healthcare services to remote communities by Grant Gillis, Member , Working Group 2, of ISO/TC 215, Health informatics ISO Focus : How does telehealth work to bring medicine and education to communities in remote areas ? Grant Gillis : Telehealth, a term defined as the use of telecommuni- cation techniques for the purpose of providing telemedicine, medical education, and health education over a distance, works in many different and distinct ways to bring clinicians and care closer to patients and people in remote and isolated communities. Here in Canada, and certainly around the world, large and small efforts are using a variety of \" tele \" technologies and techniques to extend and enhance the array of healthcare services. These efforts are helping in important ways to provide new and innovative opportunities to manage the consequent need for more intensive care for those who can not easily or economically travel to receive long- term, complex care. Even more important, tele- health is advancing the convenient availability of health promotion and wellness campaigns, reinforcing the empowerment of citizens and indeed nations to understand and advocate for health services and thus safeguard their health and wellbeing. It is cer- tainly quite evident that telehealth programmes, by extending services into hinterland regions, is making basic, but significant contributions to the health of residents of these more remote areas. Finally, in many nations, the portability of telehealth programmes is also beginning to reverse the dec- ades-long exodus of clinicians to urban locales. Through telehealth, physicians, nurses and other clinicians have increasing access to advanced medical technology, the availability of which was only recently restricted to metropolitan centres. Clinicians are therefore less isolated when it comes to support in the day-to-day care of their patients, even in the \" solo \" practice setting ; through the integration of telehealth into their daily practice, they can call upon colleagues to assist with diag- nostic and therapeutic support. One of Canada's remote communities served by telehealth technology. ISO Focus February 2007 21Main Focus In addition to the value propo- sition of enhanced coverage for their patients, clinicians in rural and remote communities can use telehealth to continue not only their own ongoing medical education, but also to provide learning opportunities for the next generation of clinicians.standards development), it is quite appropriate to say that we are only at the very threshold of the clinical informatics era. Interoperability of information is even now transcending our current electronic health record (EHR) efforts : medical devices such as pacemakers, insulin pumps, and hemodialysers are beginning to incorporate their own information applications that can share information with other external devices as well as EHRs, ensuring that patient and clinician alike have the latest information at their fingertips. Achieving the potential of this paradigm translates to optimal efficacy of diagnosis and treatment. There are many more years of work to come but, with security and privacy well and appropriately in place, the interoperability of information through standards will revolutionize the design and delivery of healthcare to an extent never seen before. With appropriate alignment, again through standards, telehealth systems can serve to vanguard the benefits of interoper- ability to the furthest reaches of any nation. ISO Focus : Has there been collaboration among sectors, for example among the information technology sector, telecommunications industries and health educators ? Grant Gillis : One of the large and often unappreciated benefits of work- ing towards interoperability through International Standards is indeed the wealth of collaboration achieved and achievable. ISO alone has an amazing scope, addressing technology issues with more than 200 technical com- mittees, and with its close relationship with IEC, is a platform truly without peer for cooperation in standards development. In this respect, the number of ISO, IEC and JTC 1 committees that ISO/TC 215 itself works in liaison with is approaching 30 ! While this is definitely a challenge in sustainability, it thoroughly points to the potential of the ISO framework. Outside of ISO, IEC and JTC 1, ISO/TC 215 has active liaisons with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the World Health Orga- nization (WHO) CEN/TC 251, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), HL7, Digital Imag- ing and Communications in Medicine Physician discussing an imaging result. ISO Focus : In the past, the interoperability of telehealth systems was a constraint. How can International Standards facilitate the long-term sustainability and potential of telehealth systems by improving interoperability ? Grant Gillis : International Stan- dards are certainly becoming more of an enabler for telehealth systems, facilitating rather than impeding the more extensive delivery of care. In particular, as the portfolio of standards builds, and as their integration into system applications broadens, greater connectivity not only becomes more possible, but simpler and increasingly automatic. The latter characteristics allow patients and people, clinicians and planners to be more creative and responsive when it comes to delivering care and sustaining health. While interoperability is only now being achieved, and to be fair, in yet relatively small pockets, the consequent improvement of outcomes in the quality, safety, effectiveness and efficiency of care is certainly tantalizing. And, despite years of planning and investing (including A telehealth-equipped nursing station. 22 ISO Focus February 2007(DICOM), the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Informa- tion Standards (OASIS) and others. With these stakeholders, the leadership and members of ISO/TC 215 work to promote stronger coordination amongst the key players in all technical areas of health information standardization, including telehealth standards. Development plans and work projects are shared thoroughly and early, with an overall focus towards comprehensive awareness and con- sensus towards a harmonized global approach. Even so, we know these collaborative engagements must be improved upon. ISO/TC 215 has therefore undertaken to extend its col- laboration through its Global Summit on Health Information Technology series of meetings, a new forum through which the technical committee works to dialogue with and raise awareness among the key constituents, clinicians, vendors and national agencies that adopt and implement its standards. ISO Focus : Given the potential of telehealth to reach remote rural communities, what kind of information technology is necessary for those communities to receive the services ? Would it be a useful solution for developing countries where budgets are often inadequate to provide healthcare ? Grant Gillis : Let's consider the last question first. Too often the reach of telehealth technology is characterized as being of primary benefit for rural and remote communities in develop- ing countries. While for these locales and nations, it is indeed an obvious alternative, and a definite benefit where budgets and resources are often insufficient, telehealth will and is revolutionizing care in metropolitan centres and the so-called developed countries as well. Take my country, Canada, as an example. Our inherent challenge involves providing health and health care services to a relatively small and unevenly distributed population in, geographically speaking, one of the world's largest, most diverse and rug- ged countries. Compound that with our corresponding shortages of clinicians, and you quickly understand why our so-called developed nation is quite interested in a technology that is viewed by more than a few as best suited for ' developing ' countries. In all candor, telehealth offers useful solutions for every country. Telehealth technolo- gies are becoming more affordable, attracting more investment capital and, with the consequent savings and improvements,, are enjoying a growing global appeal. As to the first question, a variety of technologies is necessary to receive health and healthcare services in a sustainable integrated manner. These include base connectivity technologies, (which are increasingly Internet-based), to support such functionalities as cli- ent/provider/facility identification, common scheduling, charting, results reporting and diagnostic imaging, among others. Other functionalities support the telehealth technologies that compose the networks carrying the functionalities, including equipment standards and protocols for procurement, installation, maintenance and upgrade. ISO Focus : Have there been recent developments in terms of international networks for the development of telehealth ? What role can International Standards play in facilitating the use of telehealth, in terms of both the technical aspects and the distribution aspects ? Grant Gillis : Telehealth is working towards a vision where it is technologi- cally possible for a system, deployed on a regional basis, to support the provision of an optimal standard of About the author Grant Gillis is Director of Standards with Canada Health Infoway Inc.

Physician accessing digital x-ray over the Internet. ISO Focus February 2007 23Main Focus care, a single standard uninfluenced by distance and geography. Much progress has been made, but achieving this vision will neces- sitate additional determined action and sustained commitment. Eventually, telehealth will be part of important, perhaps even the principal component of, health informatics systems around the world. But in order for this to be so, advancing the technological as well as the clinical feasibility of the information system is required. Networks must be consolidated and streamlined, increasing overall capacity while alleviating disparate systems and duplicative efforts. Yet, for the overall success of telehealth, this technical evolution must be accompanied by the adaptation of the corresponding clinical applications. To achieve an optimal, stream- lined standard of care, diagnostic and therapeutic regimens must be revised, taking into account the opportunities and challenges of at-a-distance care as experience accumulates and lessons are learned. The clinical community is work- ing to refine care standards accordingly, and the next generation of clinicians is being exposed to a growing variety of telehealth-delivered education and training opportunities. Telehealth can not replace the in-person encounter between clinicians and their patients, but it is increasingly capable of effec- tively and efficiently supporting their interactions. The horizon is not far off where telehealth will be a vestige technological term, reflecting a time when extending care to all places and all people in an integrated, interoper- able manner was just a prospect, not the standard.Medical history available by using a smart card by Frans van Bommel, convenor , 5 , Health cards , and Manager of the Standardization Department at V ektis BV (Information Centre of the Dutch Health Insurers) in Zeist, The Netherlands You are suddenly taken ill in the middle of a country where you do not speak the language and you cannot explain your medical his- tory. What do you do ? In a few years, assuming the standardization process proceeds smoothly, this will be a prob- lem of the past : your health card with your medical history will help medical practitioners ascertain what is needed with a minimum of dialogue. Being able to carry a secure card that gives access to your medical records is a powerful tool in improv- ing patient care. By using smart cards, medical professionals are able to access the patient data they need quickly and reliably, saving valuable time and expense - and time may be at a premium. Although there are some eth- ical and technical problems to be resolved, healthcare cards are almost certain to become a part of our every- day lives while offering tremendous improvements. This article surveys the benefits of health cards, focusing specifically on one standard, ISO 21549, Health informatics , because patient health card data could soon have important applications. What is a health card ? A health card contains com- puter-readable data that is issued to a patient or healthcare professional to facilitate the provision of health- care. Some countries in the European Union have planned or begun nation- al or regional implementation of pro- grammes using health cards. A variety of technologies can be used to allow computer-readable data to be stored on a health card, including bar codes, Radio Frequen- cy Identification (RFID), magnetic stripes, integrated circuit memory cards, integrated circuit smart cards and optical memory cards. Uses for health cards in healthcare information systems include administrative func- tions, emergency health, records of speciality-specific care and general patient-held medical records. New horizons for health cards have opened up, with more portals con- taining actual information which can be accessed in a safe way by health or identity cards. The need for large data \u00a9 Siemens AG 24 ISO Focus February 2007storage on cards will decrease; how- ever, a minimal amount of data still needs to be available on the cards as electronic infrastructure will not be available everywhere. That is why iGlobalized interop- erable systems are crucial to the wide- spread adoption of health card tech- nology. Unless such systems are avail- able, applications will be fragmented. Recognized International Standards, developed by consensus and accepted worldwide, have an important role to play in ensuring their emergence.What is health card interoperab ility ? Interoperability between health card systems (hardware and software) is the ability of one health card system to read, use and/or update the data on health cards issued by another health card system. Many of the benefits of health cards derive from the convenience of using them across geographical and organizational boundaries ; therefore, there is a need to develop interopera-ble health card systems, an important prerequisite for the widespread use of health cards. Interoperability is the key to unlocking the benefits and for the realization of a global market and the use of health cards. Enter ISO/TC 215/ Working Group 5, Health cards Within ISO/TC 215, Health informatics , WG 5, Health cards , 56 experts from 20 countries, nominat- ed by their national standards bodies, are currently working on harmonizing the systems and interoperability in this fast-moving sector. The use of personal health data is a delicate subject, especially due to concerns about the possibility of public revelation of health data. The risks involved in health cards are hard to assess. Those in favour of the cards underline their benefits : lower administrative costs and improved attention to the patient because of fuller and more precise information. But even this comes under fire as factual information alone can give rise to new problems, such as to how to define areas of responsibility and which parts of the card doctors should be able to read in order to prescribe the correct medications. Other doubts have to do with emergencies and the use of biometric functions, for example the difficulty in deciding whether an unconscious patient has their own card in their wallet or someone else's. A study carried out by the European Commission (EUROCARDS action) has shown that in many European countries thinking of introducing the smart card in health systems, the card was not considered as an isolated object, but as a technology linked to a global communication system. Smart cards are a key element in medical telematics applications. Interoperability between systems of health cards aims to allow administra- tive and emergency clinical information, stored in separate health cards, to be read by healthcare professionals using different computers and software. This is one of the strategies of the G7 project on global health services.Putting fears to rest - Overcoming reticence to using health cards ISO/TC 215/WG 5's brief is to produce standards in the field of healthcare use of machine-rea dable cards including dimensions, defined in ISO/IEC 7810, Identification cards - Physical characteristics . WG 5 plac- es special emphasis on technology- indepen dent data structures leading to interoperability and compatibility, including data commu nica tion. For the data structure, information from the HL7 RIM is used. WG 5's mission is to focus on cards used to identify patients and healthcare providers, both as in dividuals to information systems and in terms of record linkage.

In 2006 he was appointed convenor of ISO/TC 215/WG 5, Health cards .The emphasis is also on develop- ing standards for the content of cards, not just the technology. The latter is covered by other groups, such as the ISO/IEC JTC 1, Information tech- nology , SC 17, Cards and personal identification , that has developed, among other standards, the impor- tant series ISO 7816, Identification cards - Integrated circuit(s) cards with contacts . Though the standards must be technology-independ ent, the group only considers cards produced accord- ing to ISO/IEC 7810, Identification cards - Physical characteristics , i.e. only cards which are the size of a credit card. For 2008, an orientation study is foreseen by WG 5 for the use in healthcare of common identity cards and mobile phones, in order to get secure access to administrative and healthcare data stored in portals. Standardization - regional experience WG 5 had the benefit of ground- work and experience from studies and trials carried out in different coun- tries and regions, such as the eEurope Smart Card Initiative's White Paper Smart Cards as Enabling Technol- ogy for Future-Proof Healthcare : A Requirements Survey. The results of this study are expected to form the central element of the European Union's input into this wider international initiative. The strategy is to reuse rather than rein- vent. Standards published by ISO and the European Committee for Stan- dardization (CEN), as well as exist- ing work of European Union-funded projects, national initiatives, and rel- evant industrial contributions will be adopted wherever possible. The task is to assemble this existing work to increase interoperability. Work ahead for ISO The first subjects considered by WG 5 group include the following : extension of European registration standards to cards ; technical report for the use of cards in healthcare ; electronic medication (prescrip- tion) on cards ; references and record linkage (links) ; patient health card data (multipart standard). We consider each of these in turn before studying in detail the latter key item, ISO 21549, Health informat- ics - Patient healthcard data . From 2006, a Unified Modelling Language (UML), Reference Informa- tion Model (RIM) was used to keep consistency between all the standards of WG 5. New ideas for future work items were introduced: 2007 : Overview of national health- care professional card projects (together with CEN/TC 251) 2008 : Possible study for the use of health information without a Patient Data Card using ID-cards and/or the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) Extension of European registration standards to cards This work item specifies iden- tification cards and the extension of the two European standards : EN 1387, Machine-readable cards - Healthcare applications - Cards : general characteristics ; EN 1867, Machine-readable cards - Healthcare applications - Num- bering system and registration pro- cedure for issuer identifiers . The two European standards were accepted as working drafts in 2001. Experts were nominat- ed to examine them, with Japan as the chair ; this group set out to adapt the European standards and these were then adopted as Interna- tional Standards ISO 20301:2006, Health informatics - Health cards - General characteristics, and ISO 20302:2006, Health informatics - Health cards - Numbering system and registration procedure for issu- er identifiers . Technical report for the use of cards in healthcare This proposal was made by the USA, recommending a technical report on the use of cards in health- care and was supported by all coun- tries. Subsequently, the group decid- ed that this was not a topic suited to an International Standard, but one 26 ISO Focus February 2007Where health cards have been introduced, the approach must be secure, as trust in their confidentiality and effectiveness needs to be won. In Taiwan, for instance - a recent example of acceptance of a national card which includes health data - the IC health card rollout marked a major mile- stone in the technological advancement of health services, and there are to be multiple stages in this project, such as ongoing infrastructure upgrades, public education and acceptance of the new card system. \" We will employ the latest technology to ensure a smooth transi- tion and operation for both health professionals and card users,\" said Lou- is Liu, General Manager of the Department of Planning and Evaluation of the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI).

The NETC@RDS consortium is preparing the future e-EHIC solution in order to supply the same service for all European Union/European Free Trade Association (EFTA) citizens based on different, but interoperable, national/ regional IT infrastructures. At the moment national health cards in Europe are often combined with the EHIC as the back side of the national card.eHealth : Health cards in action that would be worked on voluntari- ly within the group. In 2006 in the USA a lot of cards were used in healthcare (over 100 million). The need for harmo- nizing all these cards will focus on the identification aspect. The USA WEDI working group will give rec- ommendations for implementation in the future. Electronic medication : prescriptions on cards From the outset, one of the major topics of WG 5 has been that of electronic medication prescrip- tion. During discussions it became obvious, however, that many nation- al definitions already existed, e.g. in Australia. It was thus agreed to start with an investigation of existing standards and to decide whether a specific for- mat for electronic prescriptions on cards was needed. It was also agreed that, particularly in this case, a clos- er link to the working group, ISO/TC 215/WG 1, Data structure , and WG 6, Pharmacy and medication business , needed to be established. The group finally decided not to publish an International Standard on the subject but to integrate the elec- tronic prescription as a component of the patient health card data standard (ISO 21549). In 2002 discussions centred on whether to have a comprehensive electronic prescription including a full medical history or merely medication data. This has resulted in the publica- tion of Part 7: Medication Data of ISO 21549, Patient health card data . References and record linkage Much debated was the need for a standard on the storage of references and links to specific data items. Final- ly it was decided to integrate this top- ic into the overall standard on patient health card data as part 8 (Links). A new work item proposal (NWI) was made by WG 5 with assistance of the European Federation of Medical Informatics (EFMI) and approved at the end of 2006. What data is in a patient's health card ? With the growing use of data cards for practical everyday health- care delivery, the need has arisen for a standardized data format for inter- change. The patient data carried by a data card can be categorized in three broad types : identification, adminis- trative and clinical. It is important to realize that a health card has to con- tain device data and identification data and in addition, may contain administrative, clinical, prescription and linkage data and these all have clearly defined criteria.

ISO Focus February 2007 27Main Focus Health information terminologies : Standards and practice by Christopher G. Chute, MD Dr PH, and Heather Grain Health information standards The advent of human genomic applications in healthcare reminds us that rapid advances in health technology are well upon us. Health- care today is vastly more complex than it was just 20 years ago, relying more fundamentally upon knowledge, information, data, and their interac- tions. Furthermore, ensuring the ready availability of information in comput- ers for clinical decision making is now a requirement. The data that confront clini- cians and patients poses new chal- lenges for synthesizing and digest- ing that information. Clearly, the very real requirement that such informa- tion be comparable and consistent in its representation and presentation is a made-to-order task for standards development and implementation. Semantic interoperability One of the major challenges of the explosion of information and the capacity to generate, transmit, and share such information, is making sure that the information can \" plug and play \" in new environments and distant loca- tions. The problems of interoperabil- ity, or ensuring that information can be sent by a source machine and read by a target, has been a long-standing challenge in computer science and health informatics. Traditional interoperability has largely focused on syntactic inter- change, which means the formats information, and be usable in deci- sion support software environments, is a recent innovation. Part of this is due to the technology for authoring and rendering complex biomedical terminologies, attributable in part to innovations in computer science, that make available simplified ver- sions of terminology which are called description logics. The simplified logics balance the expressive power available to ter- minology authors with the computa- tional complexity of logical specifi- cations. No computer can manage the full complexity inherent with first- order predicate logic, though many simple variations of description log- ics do an outstanding job of provid- ing expressive authoring capability while ensuring that the resulting ter- minologies are computable in rea- sonable time. Description logics have funda- mentally transformed human capac- ity to author and consistently main- tain complex terminologies. They can support the more complex and and layout of data must be the same. However, to be useful in healthcare, information must not only get from one place to another in a consistent format, it must get there in a way that can be understood. Decision support techniques and patient safety now demand that computers - as well as people - must be able to understand this information. The only solution for what is there- fore called \" semantic interoperabil- ity \" is that the contents of messag- es exchanged for clinical care must conform not only to a standard syn- tax, but must also contain standard vocabulary elements. The central role of terminology Terminology standards have lan- guished in the background for decades, relegated to mortality classifications or simple drop-down categories of demo- graphics and status measures. The emergence of a vocabulary that can exchange detailed clinical \u00a9 Siemens AG 28 ISO Focus February 2007challenging use cases that arise in biomedical science, be it in a prac- tice application or in research data interchange. needed for biomedicine, but it does have substantial experience in how such terminologies can and should be developed. Thus, WG 3 standards and reports specify : what constitutes a good terminol- ogy ; a formal glossary of terms and con- cepts used in creating terminology and semantic content ; how terminologies might be inte- grated into a clinical domain space as exemplified by the nursing termi- nology information model effort ; policy issues associated with the creation of terminologies intended for broad application throughout bio-health. One of the core issues asso- ciated with terminology use is the intellectual property restrictions that are placed on many health informa- tion terminologies. Because termi- nologies are effectively the \" peri- odic tables \" of health information, barriers to their access and use, be they economic or other modes of restricted access, can greatly inhibit the delivery and practice of quality healthcare throughout the world. For these reasons, many of the policies and guidelines that are emerging in recommended good ter- minology practices ensure that fair and reasonable access to terminol- ogy content be a core principle of good practice. In summary, the domain of health information terminology devel- opment has emerged from a static backwater to a highly dynamic fore- front of health information technolo- gy and standards development. As sophisticated semantic con- tent based on description logic tech- nologies begins to become widely available, we anticipate that the next decade of health information termi- nology standard development will be even more exciting.\" The creation and management of terminologies has become a central challenge in making health information standards work.\" The creation and management of terminologies has become a central challenge in making health informa- tion standards work. The next chapter in the health terminology implemen- tation agenda is to ensure that these terminologies are appropriately bro- ken up into manageable units that are appropriate for a given use case. This is often called the value- set problem, which means that it is not sufficient to generate complex ter- minologies, but they must be divided up into useful segments to be plugged into specific applications. ISO's role in health standards ISO/TC 215, Health informat- ics, was founded in 1998 to begin addressing the complex issues of biomedical data interchange. One of the core working groups formed at the inception of this technical com- mittee, WG 3, focuses on vocabu- lary. The working origi- nally called Health tation . The Semantic content work- ing has not attempted to cre- ate reusable health terminologies for application throughout the bio- medical health arenas, but rather to focus on principles and methods by which such terminologies can be generated. The relatively small working group does not presume to have the domain depth or knowledge to cre- ate all terminologies that might be Heather Grain heads Health Informatics in the School of Public Health at La Trobe University, Victoria, Austral- ia.

Health informatics standards harmonization - Going where we need to be ! by Don Newsham, convenor of ISO/TC 215, Health informatics , WG 1, structure , and Grant Gillis, an expert in WG 2, Data interchange, and Director of Standards with Canada Health Infoway Inc. Wayne Gretzky, only slightly arguably the greatest hock- ey player of our times, had one key strategy in his success - go to where the puck is going to be. His foresight and uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time was a winning strategy, a hallmark applicable in sports and many endeavours. For the health information and technology standards community, do we have that winning strategy to go where we need to be ? Can we provide the right stand- ards at the right time to globally achieve our goal of interoperable electronic health records in support of health care transformation and delivery ? Can we harmonize our impor- tant health informatics standardization efforts to be more e-responsive to the burgeoning healthcare needs around the world ? Electronic health records (EHR) and the enablement of \" e \" health are now considered essential components of quality, safe, accessible, and effective care. Driven by better information for better health, more than 70 countries are undertaking an EHR or e-Health strategy in one form or another. From the most rural and remote communities to the world's largest metropolitan centres, these electronic strategies are transforming healthcare and health at an unprecedented pace and scale in human history. This transformational change is being applied across the entire busi- ness spectrum of healthcare. Com- posed of, and enabled by, interoper- able health informatics systems and tools, the basis of change is derived from standards development. Health information standards are key enablers, supporting clini- cians, suppliers, purchasers and imple- menters as they design and deliver the new informatics systems of today and tomorrow.

About the authors Don Newsham is an association Chief Executive Officer, senior consultant, health information standards leader and former CIO and CFO with over 28 years' experience in Canadian and international healthcare. He is the inaugural CEO of COACH, Canada's Health Informatics Association and has led many projects with Canadian standards organizations and ISO/TC 215 since 1999. He is Head of the ISO/TC 215 Delegation for Canada, convenor of its working group WG 1, Data structure , and serves on numerous standards committees nationally and internationally. Level 7 (HL7) the European Commit- tee for Standardization (CEN) and a host of others have the key responsi- bility to work with these stakeholders in an ongoing manner to plan, coor- dinate, develop, and maintain these standards. The increasing pace and expand- ing scope of e-based healthcare is readily apparent to health informatics SDOs, and indeed, has been a special focus of ISO/TC 215, Health informat- ics, in the last two years. Through the \" Global Summit for Health Informa- tion Technology\" meetings in Hama- matsu, Japan, in 2005 and Geneva, Switzerland in 2006, ISO/TC 215 received strong messages of support and encouragement for global col- laboration and cooperation in health informatics standards development efforts. These messages were provided by the leaders of the national health information mandates of many countries and the various constituent standards communities including vendors, clini- cians, academics, researchers, health delivery and information managers, and other standards experts. ards for any particular health business problem. All purchasers and imple- menters need to simplify procurement and deployment of health information technology solutions through effective usable standards. The second message was equally direct. Engage the vendor community early and often in the entire standards development process. The business case for use of harmonized standards can be found within the open, innovative and effective members of a very com- petitive vendor community. ISO/TC 215, in reviewing these messages, initiated a standards collab- orative action programme that is now getting us to where we need to be - the development of an SDO Global Health Standardization Initiative. ISO/TC 215, with almost 40 participating delegations and a host of principal international health agencies such as the World Health Organization The first message was simple and direct. Harmonize your standards (see box on \" Harmonization \") and your standards efforts, not just among the working groups of ISO/TC 215, but across all standards development organ- izations impacting health information and technology standards. National mandates in all coun- tries cannot afford the time and effort to determine which standard to devel- op or use among the plethora of stand-\" Electronic health records are essential components of quality, safe, accessible, and effective care.\" ISO Focus February 2007 31Main Focus (WHO), Digital Imaging and Com- munications in Medicine (DICOM), has a large standards programme of over 100 standards published and in development. The programme now encom- passes both infrastructure standards, covering architecture and modeling, messaging, terminology and security, as well as domain standards, including health cards, pharmacy, and medical devices. A principal focus and driver of ISO/TC 215's work programme are electronic health records.experts' time and energy. We must focus on coordinating these efforts and utiliz- ing their valuable expertise effectively. Similarly in the international SDOs (ISO /TC 215, CEN/TC 251, HL7 as well as others) work programmes, the universe of standards required is highly similar, if not often equal. The work structure to develop health infor- mation and technology standards fol- lows widely known and agreed upon categories and frameworks. Architecture, data structures, messaging, terminology, security, and health domains are all universally used as the means of organizing standards work programmes. This has led to dupli- cation and overlap in standards develop- ment globally, with each SDO targeting the health stand- ards work required and requested by its member constituents. The need for a harmonization strategy amongst health information and technology related SDOs is clear given the following needs and char- acteristics : to engage standards expertise and resources nationally and globally ; consistency in structuring SDOs' work programme ; the singular overall problem domain of health care delivery and more specifically EHRs and e-health sys- tems ; and finally, the clarion call of national man- dates in every country for a clear answer to which standard(s) for which health business problem (and subsequently which single test to confirm that standard). The recent ISO/TC 215 meet- ing in Geneva resulted in a founda- tion agreement to work towards har- monized ards development with CEN/TC 251 and HL7, with leadership provided by ISO/TC 215. \" From rural communities to metropolitan centres, these electronic strategies are transforming healthcare.\"In conducting this ambitious programme, ISO/TC 215 has engaged world renowned experts from many member countries that are involved in standards development, EHR initiatives, and a host of other e-health programmes that are effectively benefiting the trans- formation and delivery of healthcare. What is not surprising is that these standards experts are also involved in their member body standard organiza- tions and in other health-related stand- ards development as the CEN/TC 251, HL7, DICOM and Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). While global in scope, the health informatics standards community is rel- atively small. Its members are high- ly motivated and passionate, and very successful in identifying and develop- ing standards in demand by worldwide stakeholders. Many engage in multi- ple SDO efforts, providing numerous contributions highly recognized for their value and utility. Given the limited resources and the potential for competing priorities, we need to take great care in using these The Chairs of the three SDOs agreed to further advance shared plans to coordinate and collaborate in deliv- ering global standards that enable inter- operable capabilities in the healthcare domain. These Chairs recognized that the collaborative effort will exceed their own individual contributions, thus strengthening the delivery of stand- ards-based solutions to all customers of health information and technology standards, and supporting the goal of safe, accessible, quality and effective health service delivery. ISO/TC 215 is undertaking a leadership role in the harmonization of globally based health informatics standards. This important effort, a response to the call to action by the many Global Summit participants, and other government and industry leaders, reflects the evolving business model of ISO/TC 215 and ISO itself, Harmonization Harmonization is defined as \"to bring into agreement or harmony\". An Industry Canada def- inition based on the Agreement for International Trade identi- fies harmonization as making identical or minimizing the differences between standards or related measures of similar scope. CEN/TC 251 identified harmonization as the preven- tion or elimination of differ- ences in the technical content of standards having the same scope, particularly those dif- ferences that may cause hin- drances to trade. 32 ISO Focus February 2007favoring a greater global focus on the orchestration of standards. Recognizing the commitment of ISO/TC 215 to serve as a global coor- dinating mechanism and focal point for the collective work of health infor- matics standards development, the ini- tial three SDOs clearly acknowledged that they will be inclusive and open to other related international SDOs joining in this growing and evolving harmonization effort. The first meeting of these, and other participating SDO's, will oper- ate as a liaisons-based Global Health Standardization Initiative, and will be launched in Montreal at the upcoming ISO/TC 215 March 2007 plenary meet- ing. The initial focus of the work of this initiative will include finalizing the business model and the governance, liaison and task structures necessary, identifying key standards harmoniza- tion priorities, and addressing the top priority harmonization issues through rationalization and coordination. Work on the specific standards harmonization tasks is already under- way through the energy and efforts of several key standards developers. The initiative will continue to foster and enhance this work and the achieve- ment of targeted, widely usable, and specific standards to achieve interop- erable electronic health records. Where will health informa- tion and technology standards be in the future? ISO/TC 215 is committed to achieve compatibility and interop- erability between systems. ISO/TC 215 will continue to be the leader in providing, orchestrating and advanc- ing a harmonized set of standards that are developed and sustained by a tru- ly community approach to the entire health information standards develop- ment cycle and by a committed group of like-minded standards development organizations. That is where the standards game needs to be, and that is where we are going. Health informatics standards harmonization is key to winning the day in achieving better information for better health globally.Figure 1 - Thermograms of the faces of two children, the top with clinical fever and the bottom with normal temperature.

Despite the increasing numbers of people arriving and departing, we all wish to minimize the time needed to check in and pass border controls before boarding a plane. Since 9/11, increased security has been introduced in most countries. However, other threats relating to a pandemic could well bring in another type of screening of all passengers, particularly on long haul flights, involving passage to or from Southeast Asia. Avian influenza, infection from the H5 N1 virus, is a current threat that is being addressed by several agencies. Birds are a limitless reservoir for viral infections. It is estimated that during an outbreak, 30 % of a population could become ill, and especially at risk are children and the elderly due to their lower immunological resistance. In many cases, survivors of the resultant severe respiratory infection could suffer permanent physical damage and become ventilator-dependent. A report published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in May 2006 states that the virus has been found in birds in 46 countries and that 206 people have died from this virus. ISO Focus February 2007 33Main Focus The WHO defines six phas- es of health alert, which are depend- ent on transmissibility of infection to humans, where phase six is pandemic. We are currently in phase three, pre- pandemic alert. In the United States, the Divi- sion of Homeland Security has issued a detailed document outlining a strat- egy for containment in the event of a pandemic alert. The report refers to body temperature screening at air- ports to identify subjects who have a fever. It is suggested that restricting travel and removing travellers with fever from a flight, could gain time to allow for the distribution of vaccines to high-risk groups. Infrared cameras measure the heat radiated by any surface, be it an inanimate object or living tissue. This method of measuring surface temper- ature has been in a continual state of development for over 40 years. The thermal images, or thermograms, pro- duced by these cameras are widely used for military, industrial and med- ical applications. Not all the infrared cameras cur- rently manufactured are designed to make accurate temperature measure- ments on humans. Some are security and night vision systems ; others are complex research tools and are unsuit- able for operating over many hours on a daily basis. For this reason, ISO and the International Electrotechnical Commis- sion (IEC) have set up a Joint Working Group (JWG) to develop standards for human temperature measurement and any procedural recommendations that might be necessary, including thermal imaging employed for temperature screening of travellers or individuals entering buildings. In preparing documents for ther- mal imaging, there are many questions that arise, such as the best way to opti- mize the accuracy of temperature meas- ured from a human face in the minimal time. Are there particular regions of the face likely to be more stable than others ? What effect will other factors unrelated to fever have on facial skin ? For example, travel today, how- ever sophisticated, is rarely stress free luggage has to be handled, food and drink, including alcohol, are consumed, and sitting in a crowded aircraft cabin add to the abnormal physical and psy- chological impact of travel.The JWG has coined the term \" screening thermograph \" for infrared equipment used for thermal screening of people. Furthermore, the JWG has determined that this equipment should be regarded as a medical device. Why should the screening ther- mograph be a medical device ? \" The consequences of the transmission of infectious diseases can be catastrophic. In the past, epidemics and pandemics have been controlled by classic public health measures using screening and quarantine. The entry to a quarantine process requires several levels of inves- tigation. The process of determining whether an individual is infected is a medical diagnostic process.\" Can the screening of travelers by thermal imaging provide a safe and certain way to detect dangerous fever ? In terms of safety, there is absolute- ly no risk to people at any age being screened by this method. The thermo- graph is a passive, non-contact meth- od of measuring heat radiated from the skin. There is no energy of any kind given out by the equipment to affect the person being screened. While there is some evidence that fever may be detected by this method, lack of controlled studies prevent it, at this point in time, from being regard- ed as a fool-proof method. In partic- The technology is highly advanced, with sensitivity possible to fractions of a degree Celsius. The human body radi- ates heat as a normal living process, and raised body temperatures from infection, fever or disease has been recognized for centuries. A raised internal body tempera- ture will also have an effect on skin tem- perature, especially on the face. The SARS outbreak in 2003 raised the possibility of using infrared thermal imaging to record temperatures of the face of all travellers in a suspect area as a method for identifying those who may have a fever, and who should be further examined by a clinical proc- ess before being cleared to board or enter the country of arrival. \" Regardless of methodology, we do know that avian (bird) 'flu is going to be harder to screen for than SARS due to the nature of the disease.\" Professor Francis Ring , DSc., is a pharmacologist and clinical sci- entist with 50 years' experience in quantitative infrared thermal imaging in medi- cine. He current- ly leads the Med- ical Imaging Research Group at the Faculty of Advanced Technology, University of Glamorgan, United Kingdom , has published over 300 papers in this area, and provides the only training course on the theory and application of Thermal Imaging in Medi- cine offered at a British university. www.medimaging.or g Professor James Mercer , Ph.D ., is a thermal physiol- ogist at the Department of Medical Physiol- ogy, Faculty of Medicine, Uni- versity of Trom- so, Norway, who has been working in this field for over 30 years. During the past seven years he has developed a special inter- est in Infrared Thermal Imaging (Medical Thermography), from both a research and a clinical point of view. He also holds a part-time position at the Department of Radiology, University Hospital of North Norway, Tromso, where he employs this technology. Further details can be found on his web site www.medical-thermography.co mAbout the authors 34 ISO Focus February 2007ular, the detection of avian influenza by this means will be more difficult than other outbreaks of fever. Regardless of methodology, we do know that avian (bird) ' flu is going to be harder to screen for than SARS due to the nature of the disease. For example, it is unclear how much fever will occur in individuals, and how long the infec- tion will be contagious before a raised temperature can be observed. Regardless of these uncertain- ties, contingency plans by US home- land security imply that temperature screening, and travel restrictions as emergency measures, may gain suffi- cient time for the distribution of vac- cines, and limit the otherwise rapid spread of avian influenza and other similar diseases. With the scientific knowledge we have today, the alarm- ing statistics of the 1818 influenza out- break should be preventable. The JWG is chaired by Prof. J Hedley Whyte of Harvard University, who has for many years led the ISO group on anaesthetics and ventilators standards, with Dr. J. Stevens, the United Kingdom rep- resentative of that same committee. The secretary, D. Osborn of Philips Medical USA, is also an experienced and active member of this ISO medical committee. Prof. James Mercer, a thermal physiologist and thermal imaging expert from Tromso University in Norway, Prof. Francis Ring, University of Glamorgan, Wales, United Kingdom, experienced in thermal imag- ing in medicine, and Prof. David Pascoe of Auburn University, Alabama, complete the core group. Other experts, including A. Thompson from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and a dele- gation from the Standards, Productivity and Innovation Board (SPRING ), the Singapore standards organization, have also attended. The latter has produced a technical document on this subject as a result of the SARS outbreak. Technical details for minimum standards are needed for a future guide to potential users of thermal imaging to be used in screening, both in air- ports and sea ports, and in hospitals involved in fever treatment should a pandemic occur. Cooperating for the safety , quality and performance of medical devices by Ms. Georgette Lalis, former Chair of the Global Harmonisation Task F orce (GHTF) Introduction to the Global Harmonisation Task Force GHTF, or the Global Harmonisation Task Force for Medical Devices, is an informal platform for regulatory authorities and representatives of industry from Europe, the United States of America, Canada, Japan and Australia. Each of these regions nomi- nates representatives to the Steering Committee, which oversees work of GHTF, and in particular of the five Study Groups. GHTF started its activ- ities in early 1993. The goal of the Global Harmoni- zation Task Force is to provide a forum for national regulatory authorities and industry representatives in the field of medical devices to promote internation- al convergence in regulatory require- ments and practices. In particular, GHTF aims to pro- mote the safety, effectiveness/perform- ance and quality of medical devices ; to encourage technological innovation ; to foster international trade ; and to serve as an information exchange forum through which countries developing medical device regulatory systems can bene- fit from the experience of those with established systems. This is achieved through the development of guidance documents and recommended procedures in order to work towards convergence of the medical device regulatory systems of its members within the boundaries of their legal and institutional constraints. Since its inception GHTF has developed extensive guidelines that represent a regulatory model for medical devices. It is important to note that GHTF is not a standardization body. All of these documents are accessible on the GHTF website : http://www.ghtf.org /. ISO Focus February 2007 35Main Focus The role of international standards in the GHTF regulatory model GHTF has long recognized that international standards are a crucial building block for harmonized reg- ulatory processes to assure the safe- ty, quality and performance of medi- cal devices. In the document Role of Stand- ards in the Assessment of Medical Devices (a revised version (SG 1 (PD) N 44) is currently open for comment on the GHTF website at : http://www. ghtf.org/sg1/sg1-proposed.htm , it is emphasized that Regulatory Author- ities developing new medical device regulations should encourage the use of international standards. various solutions to demonstrate com- pliance with the Essential Principles, and compliance with the Essential Prin- ciples remains necessary even where standards do not exist. Compliance with standards in itself does not mean that automatically the Essential Principles are being met. Manufacturers should comply with the Essential Principles, and remain respon- sible for the choice and use of stand- ards in demonstrating compliance, ver- ifying, for instance, whether use of the standard supports the intended purpose of a device. Another important role for stand- ards in the GHTF regulatory model is foreseen in relation to conformity assess- ment, in particular, in the field of qual- ity management systems where ISO 13485:2003, Medical devices - Quali- ty management systems - Requirements for regulatory purposes , was developed in cooperation with GHTF. Cooperation between GHTF and ISO Against this backdrop, cooper- ation between GHTF and ISO, as well as other international standardization bodies such as the International Elec- trotechnical Commission (IEC) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), is important to ensure that the mutual needs are met, wherever pos- sible, that there is no overlap of work and that all involved can benefit from existing expertise. GHTF has therefore participated in the work of the Healthcare Technol- ogy Task Force (HTTF), which is a task force set up to work on the follow-up of the ISO-IEC-ITU High-Level Workshop on international standards for medical technologies in 2004. This Task Force brought together the World Health Organization (WHO), GHTF, Association of Medical Micro- biology and Infectious Disease Cana- da (AAMI Canada), Eucomed and the Japan Federation of Medical Devices Associations (JFMDA) and ISO, IEC and ITU representatives with the aim of addressing recommendations that resulted from the ISO-IEC-ITU High- Level Workshop. GHTF has also set up direct links with WHO and is in the process of set- ting up links with IEC ; both WHO and IEC currently attend the GHTF Steer- ing Committee Open Sessions. Between GHTF and ISO coop- eration takes place on different lev- els. ISO has become a liaison body to GHTF, and direct contacts between the GHTF Chair and the ISO Central Sec- retariat have been established in order to to ensure a common strategy on the policy level. An ISO representative reg- ularly takes part in the GHTF Steering Committee Open Sessions. To coordinate work on specific issues Memoranda of Understanding are in place between specific GHTF Study Groups and ISO technical committees. In 1990, ISO/TC 210, Quality manage- ment and corresponding general aspects for medical devices , and GHTF prepared and agreed a Memorandum of Under- About the autho r Ms. Georgette Lalis is Director of the European Commission's Directorate Gen- eral of Enterprise and Industry. Her responsibilities cover the car industry, the pharmaceutical and medical device industry, the cosmetics industry, biotechnology and the food indus- tries. Her previous post as a Director in the Commission was in Maritime Transport. From 2001 to 2004, she returned to Greece where she was CEO and President of Ktimatologio SA, the company which establishes the Land Register in Greece. Ms. Lalis studied law at the University of Athens and then completed a postgraduate degree in International and European Law at the University of Strasbourg in France. Ms. Lalis is the outgoing Chair of the GHTF, a revolving position which she held from 2004 to 2006 when it was with the European Commission. The GHTF Chair rotates every three years and from the beginning of 2007 it is held by North America. Regulatory Authorities are also encouraged to introduce a mechanism for recognising standards that provide manufacturers with a method of dem- onstrating compliance with the GHTF harmonised Essential Principles. An important feature of the regu- latory model promoted by GHTF is that it does not in itself provide detailed tech- nical requirements, but sets out Essen- tial Principles of Safety and Perform- ance. Standards provide a tool to dem- onstrate compliance with these Essen- tial Principles. In the GHTF model, the use of standards remains entirely voluntary. Manufacturers are free to select among 36 ISO Focus February 2007standing and on this basis ISO/TC 210 has a very successful and active liaison with GHTF Study Group 3 in relation to quality management systems. Mem- bers of ISO/TC 210/WG 1 have taken part as experts in GHTF Study Group 3 meetings and vice versa . A second Memorandum of Under standing was signed in 2005 between ISO/TC 194, Biological eval- uation of medical devices, and GHTF. It defines the roles of each organiza- tion in relation to the work of Study Group 5, promoting convergence of regula- tory requirements for evidence of the clinical safety and performance of medical devices. These joint efforts have proven very successful in melding the exper- tise from both memberships and avoid- ing any duplication of work. Outlook To further enhance cooperation and to establish a well-defined commu- nication process for liaison with ISO and IEC, the GHTF Steering Commit- tee decided to nominate an ISO/IEC rapporteur at its meeting in Novem- ber 2006. The rapporteur will identi- fy and coordinate issues that require consideration by the GHTF Steering Committee. Reflections are ongoing on how to link ISO standards and the GHTF Essen- tial Principles. Such a link could take the form of an informative annex listing which elements of the Essential Princi- ples are covered by the ISO standards. This listing could also indicate which parts in the ISO standards address the elements of the Essential Principles. Such an annex is already common prac- tice in the European Union. GHTF will continue to close- ly follow the work programme of ISO in order to ensure that the needs of the medical device industry are met. One concrete example of an area of future common interest is the work on software, where a GHTF ad hoc group is coor- dinating its work with ISO 80 01:1984, Cinematography - Underexposed motion picture film requiring forced develop- ment - Designation method .ISO/Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Pilot Project by Melvin Reynolds, Senior Partner , AMS Consulting, and Secretary to TC 215, Health informatics , WG 7, Devices Background In September 1998, I SO Council passed a resolution to explore new opportunities with select standards development organizations . So, in December 1998, the Insti- tute of Electrical and Electronics Engi- neers (IEEE) was invited to present a pilot proposal. The IEEE with its 1073 family of standards was identified as a good candidate because the organiza- tion was already involved in intensive informal cooperation with ISO and the European Committee for Standardiza- tion (CEN). The proposal was submitted to ISO in March 1999, and after revision and refinement, was approved by ISO Council in October 2000. Which documents ? Initially the Pilot Project target- ed only the IEEE Medical Information Bus Committee of the Engineering in Medicine and Biology (EMB) Socie- ty's 1073 standards already in print or in late development. It now includes all the norma- tive documents in the health informat- ics family - Medical Device Commu- nication (MDC) - and the numbering has been harmonized between IEEE and ISO so that all jointly labeled MDC products are designated ISO/IEEE 11073-xyyzz. Highlights of the process IEEE takes responsibility for the development and maintenance, with unrestricted participation of ISO and CEN member bodies. Jointly devel- oped 11073 standards and/or drafts are submitted to ISO TC 215 (and CEN TC 251) for consideration. A ballot of TC 215 is conducted to send the documents for a DIS ballot ISO Focus February 2007 37Main Focus of ISO member bodies, and for enquiry in CEN. The joint technical committee conducts a five-year periodic review of the documents and ballots for revision, reaffirmation or withdrawal.

Mr. Peter Dennehy , the Secretary of ISO/CASCO until the end of 2006, gave an overview of the ISO Strategic Plan 2005-2010 , together with the organization's strategic objectives and the results ISO expects to achieve. Regard- ing conformity assessment, ISO has the objective of providing a comprehensive range of standards and guides for the implementation and recognition of good conformity assessment practices, suitable for all forms of first, second or third party involve- ment and evalu- ation. M r. M a r i o Wittner , the then Chair of ISO/CASCO recalled that the work car- ried out by the commitee aims to : encourage the reference and use of CASCO documents by regulators, which implies their adoption by the national standardization bodies ; consolidate the relationships with international organizations ; monitor the references to ISO's name in relation to ISO 9001:2000 and the adherence to ISO ethical principles.He explained that a survey con- ducted by the Market Feedback Panel on the use of CASCO documents has demonstrated that 85 % of ISO members have adopted as their national standards ISO/IEC 17025 and ISO/IEC 17020. Other standards and guides adopted at national level were ISO/IEC 17024 (80 %), ISO/IEC Guide 65 (75 %), ISO/IEC Guide 62 (70 %) and ISO/IEC 17011 (55 %). At regional level, The Pan Ameri- can Standards Commission, ( COPANT) has adopted most of CASCO's stand- ards and guides and the trading region of MERCOSUR (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela) has already adopted 10 of the most relevant CASCO standards and guides. In Europe, European Standards on con- formity assessment are all adoptions of CASCO documents due to the Vienna Agreement between European Commit- tee for Standardization (CEN) and ISO and European Union countries have to adopt them as national standards. Mr.Wittner finished his pres- entation saying that CASCO's work is relevant for the market, as a politi- cal-commercial survey conducted by Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) confirms. He pointed out that exporters stated there is widespread support for extending the Supplier's Declaration of Conformity (SDoC) provided that product liability legislation and market surveillance are in place. Mr. Randy Dougherty , the Director of Accreditation of ANAB (ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board) stated that the purpose of ISO/IEC 17021, Requirements for bodies providing Handover of the CASCO Secretariat to the new Secretary Sean MacCurtain .

IRAM-ISO/CASCO workshop Present and future of conformity assessment By Peter Dennehy, former Secretary of ISO/CASCO \u00a9 ISO, Photo : P . Krieger ISO Focus February 2007 39Developments and Initiatives audit and certification of management systems , is to replace ISO/IEC Guides 62 and 66 and incorporate IAF Guid- ance. The new standard, published on 15 September 2006, is applicable to any management system and the requirements are performance-based as far as possible. He provided an overview of the main changes : The standard : inclusion of six prin- ciples for certification (impartiality, competence, responsibility, openness, confidentiality, and responsiveness to complaints); Certification Body (CB) and audit team competence : International Accreditation Forum (IAF) guidance was taken into account ; The certification process : inclu- sion of the functional approach for certification audits, t he certification and audit programme that includes a two-stage audit for initial certifica- tion, three-year certification cycle. Impartiality : a committee to safe- guard the impartiality of the CB is required. Management systems requirements for CBs : Two options are provided : Option 1 - ISO 9001:2000 ; Option 2 - general management system requirements. Mr. Alister Dalrymple , Business Development and Partnerships Direc- tor, AFAQ- AFNOR gave an insight into International Standards on food safety stating that this field includes normative documents from many different sources and countries. These documents establish requirements for products, processes and management systems. ISO 22000:2005 is a management system standard used by regulators, producers, manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and consumers. Its development addressed the provisions set down in other relevant documents, such as the Codex Alimentarius, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) requirements, ISO 14001:2006, ISO 9001:2000 and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) among others. The standard recognizes four key elements to ensure food safety along the food chain : interactive communication along the food chain ; system management modelled on ISO 9001:2000 ; pre-requisite programmes ; HACCP principles tional Accred- itation Forum (IAF), stated that the key issues on which IAF is focused are how accred- itation can make a certification credible and how accredi- tation serves the needs of governments, protecting people and the environment. Accreditation is the only way to ensure free international trade without barri- ers. The legal framework, a conformi- ty assessment system and multilateral recognition agreements all contribute to free international trade. The IAF Global Conformity Assessment System is a web of Accred- itation Bodies (ABs) operating accord- ing to internationally accepted docu- ments and providing internationally accepted conformity assessment results, leading to one accreditation, one stand- ard, and one test/certification accepted everywhere. Mr. Lorenzo Thione , Chair of Euro- pean Accreditation, stressed the val- ue of accreditation for the economies of the European countries. Free glo- bal trade of products and services con- forming to customer's requirements and legal requirements requires har- monized accreditation rules and pro- cedures. This is achieved by referenc- ing standards accepted worldwide and by applying proper control of multina- tional ABs. To enhance the value and effi- cacy of accreditation, improvement actions are needed, such as reinforc-ing the cooperation with stakeholders, improving accreditation rules and pro- cedures, adopting more rigorous sanc- tion policies, enhancing the effective- ness of peer assessments. Mr. Richard Hadfield , Director of the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI), gave an overview of IQNet, an international network of manage- ment system CBs, comprising 38 part- ner organizations with more than 200 subsidiaries worldwide. IQNet partners have certified more than 200 000 com- panies in 150 countries. The role of the IQNet peer assess- ment is to evaluate the competences expected from an IQNet partner, to monitor the ongoing conformity with IQNet rules and criteria and to support partners in learning and further devel- opment. IQNet peer assessment criteria are based on ISO documents, The IQNet Best Practice Evalua- tion is focused on 10 excellence fields : planning; customers ; product portfo- lio; competence, business processes, improvement tools, partnerships, finan- cial results; non-financial results, pro- motion and communication. Mr. Hadfield said that the ben- efits from IQNet for management sys- tem certification customers are : a more effective exchange of knowledge, focus on effective service improvement, increased value of certification to cus- tomers, and IQNet partner awareness and satisfaction. Mr. Nigel Croft , Co-Convenor of the ISO 9000 Advisory Group (IAG) spoke about ISO 9001:2000 clarifying that it is not a product certification standard, but it is expected that the certified organi- zations will provide products that con- sistently fulfill customers' requirements. He believes that we are all responsible for generating confidence in the cred- ibility of ISO 9001;2000 certification. He said that here are \" good guys \" certification bodies and \"bad guys\" certification bodies. The first consider the needs of their clients and of the client's customers, their deci- sion making is technically sound and they are able to add value. The latter are commercially driven, their aim is 40 ISO Focus February 2007to maintain or increase market share, their approach to auditing is \" tick- the-boxes \", and their cost is low as is the added value of their certifica- tion services. Finally, there are intelligent pur- chasers who purchase based on over- all life cycle cost and give credit for good quality/performance, and there are ignorant purchasers who purchase only based on the cheapest price. M r . A l a n Squirrell , Sec- retary of the International L a b o r a t o r y Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC), gave an introduction to the organiza- tion, which was created in 1977 and formalized in 1996. It currently has 69 full members and associates. He introduced the subject of metrology, the science of measurement, and the four metrological pillars: method validation, calibration, quality assur- ance/control and traceability/measure- ment uncertainty, on which any valid measurement needs to rely. All four pillars are considered in ISO/IEC 17025 section 5. He stressed the importance of CIPM ( International Committee for Weights and Measures) and ILAC multilateral recognition agreements for obtaining reliable, traceable and comparable measurement results with known uncertainty. Mr. Don Gray , Chairman of the International Electrotechni- cal Commis- sion's Conform- ity Assessment Board said that IEC contribut- ed to the global market by pro- viding a unique combination of stand- ards and conformity assessment, which can give confidence to the market and reduce risk. IEC standards include the essential safety requirements for the market and the IEC conformity assess- ment schemes are specifically designed to demonstrate that products conform to standards. IEC schemes are a success story for peer assessment, he said. Well defined and accepted conformi- ty assessment arrangements are need- ed to develop credibility, confidence and trust between the parties so that test results, certificates of conformity issued by one party will be accepted by the other parties to the arrangement without further testing or assessment. The peer assessment process used by IEC schemes is based on ISO/IEC 17040:2005, Conformity assessment - General requirements for peer assess- ment of conformity assessment bodies and accreditation bodies . Mr. Graeme Drake , General Manager, Cor- porate Services, ing Aus- tralia, provid- ed examples of good regula- tory practices around the world, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements and the OECD Report on Regulato- ry Reform. Good regulatory practices are those that : comply with WTO agreements ; are transparent and non-discrimina- tory ; are performance based both regard- ing specified requirements and means for demonstrating compliance with those requirements ; refer to International Standards, tak- ing into account health, safety, tech- nological, climate, and other factors. He reminded the workshop that relying on international conformity assessment standards is in line with WTO agreements and good regula- tory practice. Mr. Jean Fran \u00e7ois Maga \u00f1a of the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) explained that the OIML addresses regulatory aspects of metrology, establishes model regula- tions and requirements, encourages mutual information and confidence between regulatory authorities and sets up mutual acceptance and recognition arrangements/agreements. The OIML is a treaty organization composed of 59 member states and 54 corresponding (or observer) members. OIML has a number of charac- teristics in common with standardiza- tion bodies : consensus, openness, performance-based requirements. It uses similar procedures and criteria including competence, impartiality, traceability, non-discrimination, as well as the same reference standards and similar assessment procedures. There is wide use of accreditation in OIML recognition and acceptance programmes. The incoming CASCO Chair, Mr. Olivi- er Peyrat reviewed the principles and elements of the European Union's New Approach, the future trends in EU Leg- islation and the links between the EU New Approach and the CASCO \" con- formity assessment toolbox \". Conform- ity assessment procedures considered in the New Approach are based on the ISO/IEC guides and standards produced by CASCO, which are adopted in par- allel as European standards. In his conclusion Mr. Peyrat said the New Approach has proven its efficiency, but improvement has to be made on market surveillance and the harmonization of conformity assess- ment tools and mechanisms (including notification and accreditation). ISO Focus February 2007 41IEC/ISO Marketing and Communication Forum Shaping the future of marketing and communications Over 120 standardization experts from more than 50 different organizations from around the world gathered together in Geneva on 6 and 7 December 2006, for the first joint ISO/IEC marketing and commu- nication forum. of identifying and delivering focused messages to chosen audiences. These included : Creating \" Lovemarks \", as opposed to traditional branded product marks, that generate additional emotion suf- ficient to create a special customer- product relationship ; Setting up, using and measuring the efficiency of blogs using monitors and modern technology ; Generating statistics on Web hits and communications campaigns ; Tracking the Internet using RSS feeds to deliver up-to-date news ; Case studies and best practice advice given by multimedia experts and cor- porate directors ; Setting up successful advertising cam- paigns with efficient audience target strategy and measuring tools ; IEC/ISO Marketing and Communication Forum communications IEC/ISO Marketing and Communication Forum IEC/ISO Marketing and Communication Forum of marketing and Forum Developments and Initiatives The forum aimed at increasing the use and sales of International Stand- ards amongst prospective users by gen- erating added awareness. At the same time, it provided an excellent oppor- tunity to exchange and learn from the experience of the many international specialists who were gathered. In his opening speech, IEC Gen- eral Secretary Aharon Amit (above) underlined the excellent track record of both the IEC and ISO in producing quality International Standards and the need to pay greater attention to com- munications if external visibility of the organizations were to be improved. During the two days, under the guidance of successful international communications players, attendees looked at some of the modern methods Above - Participants to the ISO/IEC Marketing and Communication Forum in Geneva.

Participants were able to take an active part in proposing branding strategies for ISO and the IEC during break-out brainstorming sessions and to hear some of the methods that have been applied in various standardiza- tion organizations around the world and some of the wishes of major corpora- tions involved in dealing with stand- ards on a daily basis. The closing speech of the forum, given by Alan Bryden (above) , ISO Sec- retary-General, drew parallels between the opening presentation on \" Love- marks \" and ISO's present practice. On the subject of \" Local Connections \", he mentioned that there was a network of national members and committees with the central organization there to help. For \" Customer Ownership \" he pointed out that customers are felt to be a part of the system through certification and conformance assessment. They know the benefits of this and are therefore the system's advocates, as are the trainees who go back into industry.Test your memory and learn about ISO standards ! ISO has launched a free game on its Web site to help people dis cover more ab out standards and the ben- efits they bring to so many aspects of their lives. isomemory is an online varia- tion of the card game where face-down cards are turned over two at a time and points are scored when a pair is found. With isomemory , cards are replaced by the ISO logo on which the players click to reveal a photograph related to an ISO standard. When a player suc- ceeds in clicking on an identical pair, the name of the related ISO standard is displayed, along with a short descrip- tion of the benefits it provides. isomemory results from a joint project by ISO Central Secretariat and the Austrian Standards Institute O N based on the game ON normemo . The original idea and concept came from Dr. Elisabeth Stampfl-Blaha, Vice Man aging Director of ON, and Dr. Johannes Stern, the institute's Head of PR and Media. standards ! ISO Focus February 2007 43ISO/IEC RFID standards collection on CD ISO has just launched a CD-ROM con- taining a collection of 26 ISO/IEC standards on radio frequency iden- tification (RFID). A wireless technol- ogy enabling communication between interrogating devices and embedded electronic tags, RFID is used to iden- tify and track any type of item, from individual products to shipping con- tainers, livestock and even people. RFID systems, like the bar codes that have become ubiquitous in recent decades, can carry information such as size, colour, weight and product identifier data, but without the need for physical contact between the tag and the reader. Another major advan-tage of RFID over older bar code sys- tems is the capacity to allow overwrit- ing of tag data as items move through a process. Standards are critical for many RFID applications, such as payment systems and tracking goods or reus- able containers in open supply chains. The ISO/IEC joint technical commit- tee JTC 1, Information technology , New on the shelf has worked for the past decade to develop standards for a variety of RFID frequencies and applications. Existing and proposed RFID standards deal with the air interface protocol (the way tags and readers communicate), data content (the way data is organized or formatted), con- formity (ways to test that products meet the standard) and applications (for example, how standards are used on shipping labels). The new CD, JTC 1 Collection - RFID Technology , includes 26 ISO/ IEC standards for RFID application identifiers, data protocols, registration procedures, syntax, terminology and more. If the standards were bought individually, they would cost a total of 3 031 Swiss francs, but ISO is offer- ing the CD collection for which 2 576 Swiss francs, a saving of 455 Swiss francs. It is available from ISO nation- al member institutes and from the ISO Central Secretariat. the shelf the shelf the shelf New siteOld siteThe ISO Central Secretariat is moving !

The next issue highlights the work of ISO/TC 22, Road vehicles, and ISO/204, Intelligent transport systems, demon- strating the importance of standards to vehicle safety, fuel efficiency and emissions reduction and the impor- tance of standards to transport sys- tems. Rapidly evolving technology as well as an increasing public interest for the safety and environmental performance of road transport provides a continu- ous momentum for the hundreds of standards elaborated by ISO/TC 22, which also needs to take into account the international regulatory framework for its activities as minimum standards of performance are fixed by interna- tional law. This is a moving frame- work, to which the drafting of stand- ards has to adapt. The work of ISO/TC 204 encompass- es standardization of information, com- munication and control systems in the field of urban and rural surface trans- portation, including intermodal and multimodal aspects, traveler informa- tion, traffic management, public trans- port, and commercial transport, emer- gency services, generally referred to as \" Intelligent Transport Systems \" (ITS). ISO/TC 204 is responsible for the overall system and infrastructure aspects of ITS as well as the overall ISO work programme in this field. ITS is a global market with some ITS products aimed at specific local mar- kets operating under local regulatory constraints, however many ITS are intended for installation or use in pas- senger cars, buses, ferries, trains and commercial vehicles which are built and sold globally. The ability of sup- pliers to build and distribute consist- ent products worldwide is a significant market stimulus. In addition many ITS products, especially those that are com- munications-enabled, are aimed at travelers who want consistent access to ITS services wherever they go. Con- sistency in operation, wireless inter- faces, and user interfaces, including mobile use of the Internet, are impor- tant, especially where there are safety considerations.The Linux Standard Base Last autumn, the Linux Standard Base (LSB), the interoperability standard for the Linux operating system, achieved unanimous official approval by ISO and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) to be published as International Standard ISO/IEC 23360, Linux Standard Base Core Specifica- tion. It was a significant milestone, demon- strating the maturity and scope of both the LSB and the Linux operating sys- tem, and in an article in the upcoming issue of ISO Focus , Amanda McPher- son, Director of Marketing and Com- munication of the Free Standards Group will be explained what exactly the Linux Standard Base covers and who benefits most from its existence. The LSB is produced by the Free Standards Group (FSG), a non-profit organization dedicated to developing and promoting open source software standards. The organization was formed in 1998 and hosts other standards workgroups including Openi18N (the internationalization initiative for Linux) and the Linux Accessibility "}
