The book was not very happily received by people who believed in these areas - as HG writes in the preface (p.xi): The first edition of this book prompted many curious letter from irate readers. The most violent letters came from Reichians, furious because the book considered orgonomy alongside such (to them) outlandish cults as dianetics. Dianeticians, of course, felt the same about orgonomy. I heard from homeopaths who were insulted to find themselves in company with such frauds as osteopathy and chiropractic, and one chiropractor in Kentucky \"pitied\" me because I had turned my spine on God's greatest gift to suffering humanity. Several admirers of Dr. Bates favored me with letters so badly typed that I suspect the writers were in urgent need of strong spectacles. Oddly enough, most of these correspondents objected to one chapter only, thinking all the others excellent. This was Gardner's second book, first publ 1952. This is a revised 1957 edition. The opening chapter establishes the nature of the pseudo-scientist; the remaining chapters outline a number well-researched, specific cases. CONTENTS: CHAPTERS [w] 1.
