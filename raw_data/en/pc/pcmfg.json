She will make you feel at ease during the whole process and explain what's going on. The whole thing took about 45 minutes to an hour. Ample parking for their customers. The only thing I don't like is they only accept cash or check which is a bummer. Get your nasty 6 feet gut cleaned to get all those toxins out of your body. You'll feel lighter, your skin brighter but don't take my word for it, TRY it! - 12/31/2018 I really enjoyed hydrotherapy. I came twice as the first time didn't give me the results I needed. This was my first time receiving one so I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm very glad everything was peaceful. Irina is very sweet and well-crafted, however a little chatty. I wanted to close my eyes and clear myself mentally during the cleanse, but felt like I had to continually engage in conversation or look at pictures when I needed to relax and zen. I probably should've spoken up and said something about that but I just dealt with it for the time being. - 3/15/2020 I was absolutely terrified of trying hydrocolon therapy as I've heard from medical doctors, \"this is unsafe, messes up your good bacteria, and intestines automatically clean themselves.\" I was so desperate after having chronic constipation and looking 6 months pregnant due to extreme bloating. I was also so uncomfortable. Laxatives, teas, herbal remedies....nothing worked. I finally gave it a try and can't believe I waited so long. Absolutely life changing! My therapist, Irina, is so honest, knowledgeable, and a wonderful conversationalist. I'm extremely intuitive and know when I'm being hustled. Never have I put full trust in anyone except Irina, I will forever follow any advice and directions she gives me. She changed my life! Highly recommended!!!! - 5/24/2017 I have been coming to Irina for the past year and a half - time really flies! During this time I have received the most personalized and dedicated care I had ever received. Irina always goes above and beyond to ensure all her clients are comfortable and well cared for with her infectious personality and laughter. In addition, since coming here, my physical and mental health has never been more on track. Irina also works with another therapist Natalya who is also just as amazing! - 4/25/2017 All I want to say that I made right decision choosing Crystal Springs for my colonic sessions. I immediately saw the result! My bloating went away after first session and I love my skin! It feels so hydrated! Love the light feeling after each session. The facility is very private and clean! I went for the big package and will be a regular client! Both therapist are very knowledgable! I had lots of questions and got great recommendations from them! Thank you Natalya and Irina! You are miracle workers! Recommend highly Crystal Springs! - 6/25/2017 This place has totally changed my life. I take pain meds for my knees that both need to be replaced after standing for 20+ years on concrete floors working as a Chef. The meds I take, slow down my digestion. Rather than take yet more meds, I am solving the problem naturally. Working with Irina and her staff is great. They go through some effort to protect the identity of their clients. They are very respectful and accommodating to make the colon hydro therapy as comfortable as possible. I was a newbie about 6 weeks ago. Super nervous. But I had an obstruction and didn't go for 4 days. I knew I had one of two choices. Go to the hospital and have a disgruntled CNA give me a enema or comes here for a more spa like experience. I had no idea how much getting colon hydro therapy would change my life for the BETTER. They told me if lose weight and I thought \"yeah Sure. You say that to make it more attractive and to sell packages\" but it is true. I have dropped 15 pounds and look amazing. I fit into clothes I haven't worn since before becoming pregnant with my 5 and 6 year old children. My stomach is COMPLETELY flat. My skin is glowing. Friends and family tell me I look the best in years. I will turn 47 this August and I look better than when I was 35. All because of colon hydro therapy. I have made some changes in diet. Reduced sugar and carbs. But mostly because I do not want to feel sluggish and eating those things makes me feel gross now that I am so healthy. If someone would tell me I would be a colon hydro therapy advocate a couple of months or years ago, I'd say they were crazy but today I 100% believe in this process. I even got my hubby to come and get one. He works in tech and it is unnatural for one to sit for 40 hours a week. I love him at ANY size but his stomach has been protruding out lately and He has gained a little weight. After his first therapy, HIS stomach is notably flatter. One can not put a price tag on health Do yourself a favor and make an appointment. You will not be sorry. If you follow the regime you will drop weight and look and feel great. - 5/13/2018 It's so exciting to find someone who is good at what she does, especially when it comes to our physical health. I recommend this venue to anyone looking to improve digestion, skin, immune system and sleep. - 8/9/2018 Great service by Natalia, I feel so amazing and light after just 1 colonic. I highly recommend this place to get crap out of your system, so you can feel more energized and healthy. Definitely will come back again as clean colon and health is very important to my well being. - 5/27/2014 I have been seeing Irina at Crystal Springs for many years now and I can tell you she has massively helped me with my gastrointestinal issues. I have lost weight and have a better general sense of well being thanks to her. She also is a fun person and very positive. She's a pleasure to work with.
