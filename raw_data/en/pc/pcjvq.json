For vaccine-preventable diseases such as influenza, the most effective way to reduce transmission is immunization. According to the Centers for Disease Control Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, everyone six months of age and older should get an influenza vaccine every season, with rare exception. This policy is intended to maximize influenza vaccination rates among all faculty, staff, trainees and students of Washington University, as well as non-employed personnel who provide services on-site, with the goal of protecting patients, employees, students and others affiliated with the University and the broader community from influenza infection. Policy As a condition of employment, enrollment and/or access to Washington University, School of Medicine facilities, all Washington University faculty, staff, trainees (including postdocs, residents and fellows) and students must receive an annual influenza vaccination by the annual deadline, unless granted an exemption for medical contraindications or religious beliefs. The deadline for vaccinations will be announced on an annual basis dependent upon community conditions; requests for exemptions must be received 2 weeks before the announced deadline. Individuals who assume positions after the annual deadline but before March 31 (or a later date as determined by Occupational Health Services/Student Health Services) will be required to receive an influenza vaccination or an exemption within 10 days of commencing such roles. Those individuals whose roles are fully remote are not required to receive a flu vaccination on the conditional that they are designated as being fully remote by their department in Workday and they are not expected to be on campus at any time. In the event that a remote individual must come to campus, they will be required to receive an influenza vaccination while this policy is in effect. The requirement also applies to independent contractors, temporary agency personnel, non-appointees, volunteers, and vendors. Generally, Washington University faculty, staff, trainees (including postdocs, residents and fellows) and students who do not require access to School of Medicine facilities are not required to receive the influenza vaccination however, they are strongly encouraged to take this proactive step in protecting themselves and their community. This exception is not inclusive of some Washington University departments where influenza vaccination may continue to be mandated for public health or safety reasons. Influenza vaccination will be provided free of charge to all University faculty, staff, trainees and students. Those who obtain influenza vaccination through other providers will be required to provide documentation of vaccination that is acceptable to the University in its sole discretion. In advance of the annual onset of influenza season and when the most current vaccination recommendations are published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the University will inform personnel about (1) vaccination requirements; (2) dates when vaccination is available; (3) procedures for receiving vaccination; (4) procedures for submitting written documentation of vaccination obtained outside of the University; (5) procedures for requesting an exemption; and (6) consequences of failing to obtain vaccination. For safety reasons, individuals covered by this policy who contract influenza will be expected to remain home. Supervisors and managers are to ensure that all personnel are vaccinated against influenza each year unless an exemption has been granted. This policy is not intended to cover non-affiliated visitors whose presence on campus is only incidental. Exemptions Medical: Exemptions to mandatory vaccination may be granted based on certain medical contraindications, including history or documented test indications of severe allergy to the vaccine or its components and history of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Individuals seeking a medical exemption must submit an exemption request form and documentation of medical contraindications (see Appendix 1) at least 2 weeks prior to the stated deadline. Unless otherwise determined by the University, medical exemptions are valid only for the flu season in which they are granted. If individuals who have received a medical exemption subsequently choose to receive the vaccination, they must provide acceptable medical certification before receiving vaccination from the University. Religious: Exemptions to mandatory vaccination may be granted based on sincerely held religious beliefs, practices or observances. Individuals seeking a religious exemption must submit an exemption request form and any requested documentation (see Appendix 2) at least 2 weeks prior to the stated deadline. Unless otherwise determined by the University, religious exemptions are valid only for the flu season in which they are granted. Infection control procedures: For the safety of patients and others during influenza season, individuals who are granted an exemption may be required to wear a surgical or isolation mask on campus and may be denied access to certain areas. Denial of exemption: In certain circumstances, it may be necessary to deny a requested exemption where performance of the individual's duties without vaccination would pose an undue hardship or require substantial alterations to essential job or program requirements. Compliance Individuals who fail to obtain an influenza vaccination or exemption by the announced deadline may be subject to an unpaid suspension or academic suspension for a period of up to 30 and/or a suspension of their ability to access Washington University facilities. If an influenza vaccination or exemption has not been obtained by the end of the 30-day period, or by the deadline, individuals may be subject to further remedial and disciplinary action, including but not limited to denial of access to University facilities, suspension or dismissal from applicable programs, and/or termination of employment or service contract. Vaccine Shortage Contingency In the event of an influenza vaccine shortage, the University will determine an appropriate distribution plan for the available vaccine. Influenza vaccine will be offered to individuals based on risk to patients or other University populations, job function, and risk of exposure to influenza. Priority will be given to those at highest risk after consultation with relevant medical experts. Those who are prioritized to receive vaccine will be held to the mandatory standard of this policy, while others will be excused from that standard for the duration of the vaccine shortage period.
