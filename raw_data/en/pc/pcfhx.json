It is now mainstream to read self help books, pay attention to diet and exercise, purchase home gyms, join a health club, or see a massage therapist. Did you know that last year there were more visits made to chiropractors than all MD's combined?! The world has changed. Chiropractors have always known the importance of nutrition, vitamins, diet, and exercise. In today's world, if a doctor doesn't recognize these important components of health, he would be an outcast! 21 years ago when Dr. Coleman began his [chiropractic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic) practice things were different. Why was diet and exercise not important to doctors until the public demanded it? Allopathic medical school education has always focused on the treatment of disease and symptoms and not how to help people achieve wellness. In most cases, medical physicians use medication, drugs, and surgery to alter how you feel but pay little attention to why a problem is there in the first place. Why is the \"answer\" almost always on a prescription pad? As a chiropractor, Dr. Coleman understands that medical care is essential. The focus of medical care however, is on the treatment of symptoms and disease, not how to keep people well. If the focus was wellness, you and your kids could go to your family doctor feeling fantastic and say \"Hi Doc! We feel great and we're here because we want you to 'help' us so that we can continue to be well!\". What will your Dr. tell you? It's likely they'll say: \"What are you doing here? I can't help you if you're not sick! In essence, what they are really saying is \"wait until you get sick and then we can help you.\" There are hidden costs and health liabilities when exclusively using the traditional medical model for your \"healthcare\". Allowing life to move forward without having a plan in place to achieve optimal health is the foundation to produce illness and dis-ease. If your default \"plan\" is being on the \"non plan-plan\" reconsider your intentions. Dr. Coleman and the chiropractic profession as a whole put the spot light elsewhere. Simply put, we recommend you change your oil every 3,000 miles, if you don't, it won't be long before you'll be buying a new transmission and a host of other problems. What Is Health When asked what health is, most people answer \"not having pain and feeling good\". I believe it makes more sense to define something by what it is, and not by what it's not. A body that lacks pain or symptoms does not mean it's healthy. Actually, true health is having the foundation and support beams in place required to live well. Like the spokes on a wheel, diet, exercise, sleep, water, and proper nerve supply are essential to be well. Health and well-being requires that the body is functioning optimally. Health From Within The science of Chiropractic recognizes and appreciates the fact that the body heals itself provided there is no interference to the healing process. Everyone has within them an \"Innate\" (inborn) Intelligence which controls and coordinates all body function through the nerve system. The body regulates itself perfectly. Your blood pH, for example, must be between 7.35-7.45 24 hours/day or you will die! Your Innate Intelligence regulates your pH via the nerve system so that you can live. Your brain controls everything in your body. Did you ever stop to think: What tells your brain what to do? Chiropractic Is Science The focus of Chiropractic adjustments is to eliminate nerve interference. Like the static on a telephone call where interpretation is difficult, nerves with interference do not provide a clear signal to an intended destination. This interference is a stress to the body and short circuits nerve signals. What's the result? Muscles that receive faulty instructions from the brain get stiff and rigid over months and years. Left uncorrected, the process continues, and muscles pull bones more out of alignment which cause chronic nerve damage and degenerative changes. The result is a downward spiral of dis-ease called the Vertebral Subluxation Process. Do you believe in a a higher power? God? Mother Nature? Or a Universal Intelligence? Chiropractic care is equally important for children - even when no SYMPTOMS are present! The power that creates LIFE and the body creates in the body what is most important FIRST after conception and during embryonic development...The brain and spinal chord - i.e. the Central Nervous System. At the end of life, the body \"gives up\" what is most important LAST. Testing for the existence of brain waves determines weather or not you are alive or not. In order for children and adults to experience full health expression, the body's innate intelligence and the Mind - Body Connection pathway between the brain and body must be clear of interference. Chiropractic care restores the communication pathway between the brain and body to allow organs, muscles, tissues, and body systems to work as God intended.
