Hi Melissa, what was your thought process behind starting your own business? Everything I currently offer in my business is a direct result of my own healing journey and the profound transformation I had while working with other healers. For awhile I was a fitness, dance and Pilates instructor. I realized that although I could help people physically heal, there was a strong emotional, energetic and holistic side of things that wasn't being addressed. As I worked with both a Nutritional and Energy Healer, my body felt stronger, I had less fatigue, less digestive issues, started to process and release old traumas and overall felt more calm and balanced. A few months into the process I started to feel like a different person and was much happier. Not long after I decided to study Nutritional Therapy and Reiki and once I was certified decided to open up my own business. I'm so grateful to help people heal themselves through holistic food/supplements, Reiki Energy Healing and Intuitive Counseling. What should our readers know about your business? I'm a Nutritional and Energy Healer, Reiki Master and Intuitive Counselor. What sets me apart is I offer an Intuitive Nutrition Healing Journey Program which includes: Nutritional Therapy, Energy Healing, Intuitive Counseling (Psychic Feedback), supplement testing, customized meditations, and oracle card readings. I have also certified many of my program clients in Reiki. I'm excited to offer many different holistic tools and spiritual medicine to guide and support my clients. It hasn't been easy to get to where I am today, but I'm here with gratitude and appreciation for all that I've learned along the way! As an empathetic woman, there have been times when I've played small and safe. Not always recognizing my own power, gifts and abilities. I used to only offer a la carte sessions but realized in order to truly transform, empathetic babes need their own self-healing tools and time to implement them with guidance, which is why I now offer a 1;1 Six Month Program as well as a 3 Month Group Program. I'd like the world to know that we all need healing and support, each and every one of us. I have my own team of healers (Naturopaths, Chiros, Reiki Practitioners, etc.) that I rely on as well. I took this path because I truly believe what I've learned and offer is life changing. The more you lean into your intuition, gifts and abilities, and lead from your soul versus your ego, the easier it will be to manifest happiness and abundance in all forms. Never be afraid to invest in yourself. Any places to eat or things to do that you can share with our readers? If they have a friend visiting town, what are some spots they could take them to? The beach! Santa Barbara has beautiful beaches, Butterfly Beach is my fav. Some of my favorite restaurants are Scarlet Begonia, Convivo, and Intermezzo. The best place to grab wine is the Funk Zone and there are some beautiful hikes in Montecito. I also love the spiritual shop in downtown, called Paradise Found.
