G.2 Last Updated September 2017 iii Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR ABOUT THE DETAILED METHODOLOGY The Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value- Based Payment Modifier ( Value Modifier) describes the process and method ology used to compute the Value Modifier that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will use to adjust Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) payments in 2018 for physicians , physician assistants (PAs), nurse practitioners (NPs), clinical nurse specialists (CNSs), and certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) in groups with two or more eligible professionals and those who are solo practitioners. CMS identifies these groups and solo practitioners by their Medicare- enrolled Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and will apply the 2018 Value Modifier at the TIN level . Section I provides an overview of the 2018 Value Modifier, including the relationship between the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 Annual Quality and Resource Use Reports (QRURs ) that CMS will make available to groups and solo practitioners. S ection II describes the methodology for computing the 2018 Value Modifier , and Se ction III explains the methodology for producing additional statistics included in the 2016 Annual QRURs to help physicians and other eligible professionals better understand the measures included in the 2018 Value Modifier and support practice improvement. Last Updated September 2017 1 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR I. OVERVIEW OF THE 2018 VALUE MODIFIER AND 2016 ANNUAL QUALITY AND RESOURCE USE REPORTS A. Statutory Authority and Phased Approach to Implementation As established by Section 3007 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) , the Value Modifier provides for differential payment, for items and services furnished under the Medicare PFS , to physicians and other eligible professionals. Value Modifier payment adjustments are based on the quality of care furnished to their Medicare Fee- for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries compared to the cost of care during a performance period. The ACA requires application of the Value Modifier to all physicians and groups of physicians by January 1, 2017. As finalized in the 2016 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule (80 FR 71274), CMS will also apply the Value Modifier to PAs, NPs, C NSs, and CRNAs beginning January 1, 2018. CMS computes the Value Modifier at the TIN level , which means that all eligible professionals who are subject to the Value Modifier in 2018 and billing under a given TIN will receive the Value Modifier computed for that TIN. The 2018 Value Modifier will not be applied to nonphysician eligible professionals who are not PAs, NPs, CNSs, or CRNAs. B. The 2018 Value Modifier CMS will apply the 2018 Value Modifier to payments for physicians , PAs, NPs, CNSs, and CRNAs in groups with two or more eligible professionals and those who are solo practitioners, as identified by their TIN . This includes physicians , PAs, NPs, CNSs, and CRNAs in TINs that participated in a Medicare Shared Savings Program (subsequently Shared Savings Program) Accountable Care Organization ( ACO) in 2016.1 The 2018 Value Modifier will be waived for TINs if at least one eligible professional who billed for Medicare PFS items and services under the TIN in 2016 participate d in the Pioneer ACO Model, the Comprehensive Primary Care (CPC) initiative , the Next Generation ACO Model, the Oncology Care Model, or the Comprehensive End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Care Model in 2016, and the TIN did not participate in a Shared Savings Program ACO in 2016. 1 See Section II.C.1 for more information on determining quality performance for TINs that participated in more than one Shared Savings Program ACO in 2016 and for TINs that participated in a Shared Savings Program ACO in 2016 that did not avoid the 2018 Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) payment adjust ment . For additional information on Shared Savings Program ACO TINs and the PQRS, see the document entitled \"Medicare Shared Savings Program Interaction with the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS),\" available at the following URL: . Last Updated September 2017 2 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR 1. Physician Quality Reporting System (P QRS ) Participation In 2016, eligible professionals were required to participate in the PQRS to avoid the 2018 PQRS downward payment adjustment as a group or as individuals.2 Groups can avoid the automatic downward Value Modifier payment adjustment in 2018 by participating in one of four reporting mechanisms under the 2016 PQRS Group Practice Reporting Option (GPRO): (1) Web Interface (for TINs with 25 or more eligible professionals), (2) qualified PQRS r egistry, (3) electronic h ealth record (EHR),3 or (4) qualified clinical data registry (QCDR) , and avoiding the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment. Alternatively, groups can avoid the automatic downward Value Modifier payment adjustment in 2018 if at least 50 percent of the eligible professionals in the group avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as individuals. Solo practitioners can avoid the automatic downward Value Modifier payment adjustment in 2018 if they avoid ed the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as individuals. See Section II.C.1 for quality data included in the calculation of the 2018 Value Modifier. Additional information on avoiding the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment is available at the following URL: http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality -Initiatives -Patient -Assessment - Instruments/PQRS/Payment-Adjustment-Information.html . 2. Category and Category 2 Determination Based on PQRS P articipation CMS uses the term Category 1 to refer to TINs subject to the 2018 Value Modifier that avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment. This includes: 1) TINs that reported through the GPRO and avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as a group , 2) TINs with at least 50 percent of the eligible professionals who avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as individuals, 3) TINs that are solo practitioners who avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as individuals , 4) TINs that participated in a Shared Saving s Program ACO in 2016 that reported through the GPRO Web Interface and avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment on their behalf , and 5) TINs that participated in a Shared Saving s Program ACO that did not avoid the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment on their behalf, but the TIN avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment by reporting outside of the ACO either as a group, a solo 2 For a list of eligible professionals required to participate in the PQRS in 2016, see \"2016 Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) List of Eligible Professionals,\" 2016_PQRS_List_of_EPs.pdf . 3 EHR data submitted through a direct EHR product that is Certified EHR Technology (CEHRT) or through d ata submission vendor that is CEHRT. Last Updated September 2017 3 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR practitioner, or by ensuring at least 50 percent of the eligible professionals in the TIN avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as individuals. TINs subject to the 2018 Value Modifier that do not meet the criteria for inclusion in Category 1 are classified as Category 2 TINs. In the 2018 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Proposed Rule (82 FR 34125), CMS proposed that C ategory 2 TINs will be subject to different automatic Value Modifier downward payment adjustments in 2018 based on t he composition of their eligible professionals: 1) TINs with at least one physician and 10 or more eligible profess ionals will be subject to an automatic Value Modifier downward payment adjustment of negative two percent (-2.0%) in 2018, 2) TINs with at least one physician and fewer than 10 eligible professionals , including physician solo practitioners, will be subject to an automatic Value Modifier downward payment adjustment of negative one percent ( -1.0%) in 2018, and 3) TINs with no physicians and at least one nonphysician eligible professional, including solo practitioners, who are subject to the 2018 Value Modifier will be subject to an automatic Value Modifier downward payment adjustment of negative one percent (-1.0%) in 2018. 3. Quality -Tiering Quality -tiering is mandatory for all Category 1 TINs. As described in Section II.J, quality- tiering determines the direction (upward or neutral) and size of the 2018 Value Modifier payment adjustment for each TIN based on the TIN's performance on quality and cost measures in 2016.4 High -performing TINs treating h igh-risk beneficiaries, as determined by mean CMS - Hierarchical Condition Category (CMS- HCC) risk scores, are eligible for higher upward payment adjustments (see Section II.K for more information on dete rmining whether TINs treat high-risk beneficiaries) . As described in the 2018 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Proposed Rule ( 82 FR 34125), CMS proposed to hold all Category 1 TINs harmless from any Value Modifier downward payment adjustment to their Medicare PFS payments in 2018 unde r the quality-tiering methodology. Exhibit I.1 summarizes how the Value Modifier will be applied in 2018. 4 See Section II.C.1 for more information on determining quality performance for TINs that participated in more than one Shared Savings Program ACO in 2016 and f or TINs that participated in a Shared Savings Program ACO in 2016 that did not avoid the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment on behalf of the TIN. Last Updated September 2017 4 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR Exhibit I.1. Overview of the Application of the 2018 Value Modifier *High -performing TINs treating high-risk beneficiaries (based on mean CMS -HCC risk scores) are eligible for an additional adjustment of +1.0 x the adjustment factor (AF). Last Updated September 2017 5 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR C. Relationship between the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 Annual Quality and Resource Use Reports ( QRURs ) In fall 2017, CMS will make the 2016 Annual QRURs available to every TIN nationwide, including those not subject to the 2018 Value Modifier . These confidential feedback reports provide information on the TINs ' performance on all available quality and cost measures used to calculate the 2018 Value Modifier . For TINs that are subject to the Value Modifier in 2018, the 2016 Annual QRURs provide information on how the TINs' quality and cost performance will affect the M edicare PFS payments for the TIN's physicians, PAs, NPs, CNSs, and CRNAs in 2018. For detailed information about the 2018 Value Modifier and 2016 Annual QRURs, including how to access a QRUR, please see the \"2016 QRUR and 2018 Value . Last Updated September 2017 6 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR II. COMPUTATION OF THE 2018 VALUE MODIFIER A. Overview To calculate t he Value Modifier for TINs that are subject to the Value Modifier in 2018, CMS computes a Q uality Composite S core that summarizes a TIN's performance on quality measures and a Cost Composite Score that summarizes a TIN's performance on cost measures for its attributed beneficiaries . For each measure for which a TIN has at least the minimum number of required eligible cases, CMS uses benchmark data to standardize measure- level performance to permit valid cross -measure comparisons. Standardized quality measures are categorized into one of six domains. S tandardized cost measures are categorized into one of two domains. From the standardized measures, CMS computes performance scores for each domain, which are then averaged and standardized to yield the Quality Composite Score and t he Cost Composite Score. Using the Quality and Cost Composite Scores, quality- tiering analysis determines the direction of a TIN's Value Modifier payment adjustment (upward or neutral) and the magnitude of the adjustment. Each Q uality and Cost Composite Score indicates how many standard deviations a TIN 's overall quality or cost per formance is from the peer group mean . Only composite scores that are statistically significantly different and at least one standard deviation from the peer group mean are assigned to the High or L ow Quality or Cost Tier s. Composite scores that are not statistically significantly different from the peer group mean or not at least one standard deviation from the peer group mean are deemed A verage Q uality or Cost for the purpose of quality- tiering . Exhibit II.1 summarizes th e methodology for calculating the 2018 Value Modifier. B. TINs Subject to the Value Modifier CMS will apply the 2018 Value Modifier to physicians, PAs, NPs, CNSs, and CRNAs in TINs, provided that at least one eligible professional subject to the Value Modifier is associated with the TIN. To determine the size of a TIN for purposes of applying the 2018 Value Modifier , CMS first determines whether an eligible professional i s associated with the TIN in the Provider Enrollment, Chain and Ownership System (PECOS) as of July 16, 2016. Specifically, CMS first identifies actively enrolled medical professionals, as identified by their National Provider Identifier (NPI), who have reassigned their billing rights to a TIN. CMS then examines each NPI's specialty under that TIN to determine whether the individual is (1) a physician, PA, NP, CNS, or CRNA , or (2) an eligible professional not subject to the Value Modifier . Exhibit E.1 in Appendix E provides a list of e ligible professional specialties. CMS then identifies eligible professionals who submitted claims to Medicare under the TIN for services furnished during 2016 through March 31, 2017 (to account for lags in claims submission s). If CMS identifies at least one physician, PA, NP, CNS, or CRNA in PECOS and in Medicare claims , then the TIN is Last Updated September 2017 7 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR subject to the 2018 Value Modifier.5 The size of the TIN ( 10 or more eligible professionals, or one to nine eligible professionals) for the purpose of applying the Value Modifier is the lower of the TIN's number of eligible professionals identified in PECOS and the number of eligible professionals who submitted claims to Medicare under the TIN during 2016.6 Both full- time and part-time eligible professionals , as well as those who billed under the TIN for only part of 2016, are included in the calculation. Exhibit II.1. Methodology for Determining the 2018 Value Modifier for Category 1 TINs *The performance rates of TINs with fewer than the minimum number of required eligible cases for a given quality or cost measure are excluded from the calculation of the benchmark for the measure. 5 The 2016 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule (80 FR 71276) states that a TIN is not subject to the 2018 Value Modifier if CMS does not identify eligible professionals who are physicians, PAs, NPs, CNSs, or CRNAs in either PECOS or Medicare claims. 6 If a TIN -NPI is associated with both an individual practice and a group practice in PECOS, CMS applies the group size associated with the TIN -NPIs that billed Medicare FFS during 2016. If a TIN -NPI that is listed as a solo practice in PECOS is associate d with more than one eligible professional, CMS drops the TIN -NPIs that have no billings. Last Updated September 2017 8 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR CMS will also apply the 2018 Value Modifier to physicians , PAs, NPs, CNSs, and CRNAs in TINs that pa rticipated in a Shared Savings Program ACO in 2016. CMS uses 2016 participation lists from the Shared Savings Program to identify the se TINs. C. Q uality Measures Included in the Quality Composite Score In calculating the Quality Composite Score for the 2018 Value Modifier , CMS uses at least two types of quality measures for all TINs: 1) PQRS measures and /or non- PQRS QCDR measures reported by the TIN (or its Shared Savings Program ACO ) if the TIN ( or ACO ) avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as a group , or by individual eligible professionals in the TIN , including solo practitioners, who avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as individuals; and 2) up to three claims -based quality outcome measures calculated from Medicare FFS claims submitted for Medicare beneficiaries attributed to the TIN . In addition, Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) for PQRS and CAHPS for ACOs survey measures are included in the Quality Composite Score , as applicable. See Section II.C.3 for more information on CAHPS data included in the Quality Composite Score. Each PQRS measure and non-PQRS QCDR measure is assigned to one of the following six quality domains: (1) Effective Clinical Care, (2) Person and Caregiver- Centered Experience and Outcomes, (3) Community/Population Health, (4) Patient Safety, (5) Communication and Care Coordination, and (6) Efficiency and Cost Reduction. These six domains align with the National Quality Strategy's six priorities for achieving better an d more affordable care for individuals and communities. 7 The three CMS -calculated claims -based quality outcome measures are assigned to the Communication and Care Coordination Domain, and the CAHPS survey measures are assigned to the Person and Caregiver- Centered Experience and Outcomes Domain. See Appendix B for a list of PQRS measures and non- PQRS QCDR measures included in each quality domain. For PQRS measures and non- PQRS QCDR measures with multiple performance rates, CMS determines an overall rate fo r inclusion in the 2018 Value Modifier by calculating a mean of the component parts or by selecting one component part that represents overall performance, depending on the particular measure. See Appendix C for details on PQRS measures and non- PQRS QCDR m easures with multiple performance rates, and measures that CMS has exclud ed from calculations of the 2018 Value Modifier for technical reasons. 1. Quality M easures Reported by Groups and Individual Eligible Professionals For purposes of calculating the Quality Composite Score, CMS uses either quality data reported through a GPRO mechanism by the TIN (or its Shared Savings Program ACO if the ACO reported on its behalf and avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment), if it avo ided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as a group, or quality data reported by individual eligible 7 More information on the National Quality Strategy is available at the following URL: https://www.ahrq.gov/ workingforquality/about/nqs -fact-sheets/fact -sheet.html . Last Updated September 2017 9 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR professionals if they avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as individuals under the TIN. In general, for Category 1 TINs that registered to report quality data through the GPRO in 2016, CMS uses the data reported via the mechanism for which the TIN registered \u2014Web Interface, qualified PQRS registry, QCDR, or EHR. For Category 1 TINs that did not register to report quality data through the GPRO, CMS uses the data reported by individual eligible professionals, provided that at least 50 percent of the eligible professionals under the TIN avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment. For solo practitioners who are physicians, PAs, NPs, CNSs, or CRNAs, CMS calculates the Quality Composite Score based on the quality measures reported as individuals, if they avoid ed the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment. See Section II.E for more information on the impact of t he new International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) diagnosis and procedure codes on which PQRS measures are included in the Quality Composite Score for certain TINs. If a TIN that registered to report through the GPRO d id not avoid the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment through the mechanism for which it registered, or if a TIN did not register to report through the GPRO but avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment by reporting through a GPRO mechanism , CMS uses the rule outlined in Appendix F to s elect the data for computing the Quality Composite Score. In particular: If a Category 1 TIN registered to report quality data through the GPRO, but the TIN did not avoid the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment through the registered GPRO mechanism and instead avoided it through a different GPRO mechanism, CMS uses the quality data reported t hrough the GPRO mechanism for which the TIN did not register. If a Category 1 TIN registered to report quality data through the GPRO, but the TIN did not avoid the PQRS payment adjustmen t through any GPRO mechanism, CMS uses the quality data reported by the individual eligible professionals in the TIN provided that at least 50 percent of the eligible professionals in the TIN avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as individuals. If a Category 1 TIN did not register to report quality data through the GPRO, but the TIN avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment through a GPRO mechanism , CMS uses the quality data reported through the GPRO to calculate the 2018 Value Modifier. For TINs that participated in a Shared Savings Program ACO that reported quality data through the GPRO Web Interface on their behalf and avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment , CMS calculates the Quality Composite Score at the ACO level based on the quality data submitted by the ACO. For TINs that participated in more than one ACO that avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment, CMS calculates the Quality Composite Score based on the data of the best performing ACO (that is, the ACO with the highest numerical Quality Composite Score, among the ACOs that avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment). For TINs that participated in a Shared Savings Program ACO that did not avoid the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment on their behalf but the TIN reported data outside the ACO, CMS does not use quality data submitted by the TIN to determine the Value Modifier if the TIN: 1) reported outside of the ACO through an accepted GPRO mechanism and avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as a group, Last Updated September 2017 10 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR 2) had at least 50 percent of the eligible professionals in the TIN avoid the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as individuals, or 3) is a solo practitioner and avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as an individual. However, for these TINs, CMS still computes the Quality Composite Score based on the data submitted by the TIN for informational purposes. These TINs are classified as Average Quality and Average Cost for the purpose of determining their Value Modifier. See Section II.J for mor e detail s on quality- tiering for these TINs. For more information on reporting requirements under the different GPRO reporting mechanisms, see the document entitled \"2016 Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) Group Practice Reporting Option (GPRO) Training Guide,\" Downloads/2016GPROTrainingGuide.pdf of eligible professionals avoiding the PQRS payment adjustment as individuals . CMS calculates the percent age of eligible professionals in a TIN who avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as the total number of eligible professionals in the TIN who avoid ed the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as individuals, divided by the total number of eligible professionals in the TIN (as determined by the lower of the number of eligi ble professionals identified in PECOS and the number of eligible professionals submitting claims to Medicare under the TIN in 2016) , multiplied by 100. Both full-time and part- time eligible professionals, as well as those who billed under the TIN for only part of 2016, are included in the calculation. Specifically: The numerator is the number of eligible professionals in the TIN who avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as individuals and either (a) were associated with the TIN in PECOS as of July 16, 2016, or (b) billed under the TIN for services furnished during 2016, and reported PQRS data in 2016. The denominator is the lower of the number of eligible professionals indicated by a query of PECOS as of July 16, 2016 as having reassigned their billing rights to the TIN and the number of eligible professionals who submitted at least one claim to Medicare under the TIN for services furnished in 2016. Only t he quality measures that were reported by eligible professionals in the TIN who avoided the 2018 P QRS payment adjustment as individuals are computed at the TIN -NPI level. To convert these TIN-NPI level submissions to TIN -level measures to use in the calculation of the Quality Composite Score, performance numerators and denominators are summed across all of the eligible professionals reporting th e same measure under the TIN who avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment, and the TIN -level performance rates are computed as the ratio of the aggregated performance numerator to the aggregated performance denominator , multiplied by 100.

Hospital Admissions for Ambulatory Care- Sensitive Conditions (ACSCs): Acute Conditions Composite. This is the risk -adjusted rate of hospital admissions among Medica re beneficiaries for three acute ACSCs \u2014bacterial pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and dehydration \u2014that are potentially avoidable with appropriate primary and preventive care. This measure is computed at the TIN level for TINs subject to the Value Modifi er, including TINs that participated in a Shared Savings Program ACO that reported data outside the ACO in 2016 and avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment. 8 This measure is not computed for TINs that participated in a Shared Savings Program ACO that av oided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment on behalf of the TIN. Hospital Admissions for ACSCs: Chronic Conditions Composite. This is the risk - adjusted rate of hospital admissions among Medicare beneficiaries for three chronic ACSCs \u2014 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, and heart failure\u2014that are potentially avoidable with appropriate primary and preventive care. This measure is computed at the TIN level for TINs subject to the Value Modifier, including TINs that participated in a Shared Savings Program ACO that reported data outside the ACO in 2016 and avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment. 9 This measure is not computed for TINs that participated in a Shared Savings Program ACO that avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment on behalf of the TIN.

CAHPS for PQRS survey measures are only included in the Quality Composite Score if the TIN elected to include these survey results in the calculation of the TIN's 2018 Value Modifier. See Exhibit B.2 in Appendix B for a list of CAHPS measures that are included in the 2018 Value Modifier. 11 In 2016, all ACOs were required t o participate in the CAHPS for ACOs survey. For the 2018 Value Modifier, CMS includes the CAHPS for ACOs survey measures in the Quality Composite Score for TINs that participated in a Shared Savings Program ACO in 2016 that avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment on behalf of the TIN. No CAHPS measures are included in the Quality Composite Score for TINs that participated in a Shared Savings Program ACO in 2016 that did not avoid the PQRS payment adjustment on behalf of the TIN , even if the TIN avoided the PQRS payment adjustment outside the ACO.

D. C ost Measures Included in the Cost Composite Score In calculating the Cost Composite Score for the 2018 Value Modifier, CMS calculates six cost measures based on Medicare FFS claims submitted for Medicare beneficiaries (or episodes, for the Medicare Spending per Beneficiary [MSPB ] measure) attributed to the TIN . The se measures are categorized into one of two cost domains. The Costs for All Attributed Beneficiaries Domain includes two distinct measures \u2014Per Capita Costs f or All Attributed Beneficiaries and MSPB. The Costs for Beneficiaries with Specific Conditions Domain includes four condition- specific per c apita cost measures for beneficiaries with the following conditions: diabetes, coronary artery disease (C AD), COPD, and heart failure. Per Capita Costs for All Attributed Beneficiaries. This measure represents the mean of all Medicare Part A and Part B allowed charges for a TIN 's attributed beneficiaries during 2016. Medicare Part D outpatient drug costs are not included. Per Capita Costs for Beneficiaries with Specific Conditions. These four measures are computed analogous ly to the Per Capita Cost for All Attributed Beneficiaries measure , but are only computed for attributed beneficiaries with diabetes, CAD, COPD, or heart failure. See 11 Data on the \"Health Status/Function al Status\" CAHPS measure, a descriptive measure of beneficiary characteristics, are provided to TINs for their information only. This measure is not used in the calculation of the 2018 Value Modifier. Last Updated September 2017 14 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR Section II.E for more information on the impact of the new ICD-10 diagnosis and procedure codes on the Per Capita Costs for Beneficiaries with Diabetes measure. Medicare Spending per Beneficiary (MSPB) . This measure captures Medicare Part A and Part B payments for services for episode s spanning from three days before an inpatient hospital admission through 30 days after discharge. Although the methodologies for calculating the p er capita cost and MSPB me asures differ in key respects, all cost measures are adjusted to account for variations in Medicare payment rates unrelated to resource use (such as differences due to geographic location or add-on payments for special programs) , a process known as payment standardization. They are also adjusted to account for differences in beneficiary characteristics, including prior health conditions that can affect their medical costs or utilization (risk adjustment) and differences in the mix of specialties across TINs (specialty adjust ment ). 12 More detailed information about the cost measures, including detailed descriptions of beneficiary and episode attribution, risk adjustment, and specialty adjustment, is available in the Measure Information Forms at the following URL: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare - Fee-for-Service -Payment/PhysicianFeedbackProgram/2016- QRUR.html to the are available at the following URL: http://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/ContentServ er?c=Page&pagename=Qnet Public%2FPage%2FQnetTier4&cid=1228772057350.13 E. TINs Reporting Q uality Measures I mpacted by ICD -10 New ICD-10 diagnosis and procedure codes came into effect on October 1, 2016. The new codes relevant to the Value Modifier program primarily include new diabetes diagnosis codes and cardiac procedure codes. Diabetes diagnosis codes are used when flagging chronic conditions for both the Per Capita Costs for Beneficiaries with Diabetes measure and for the denominator of the diabetes component measure included in the Hospital Admissions for ACSCs Chronic Conditions Composite. Cardiac procedure codes are an exclusion for the numerator of the heart failure component measure included in the Hospital Admissions for ACSCs Chronic Conditions Composite. For the 30- day All -Cause Hospital Readmission measure, diabetes diagnosis codes are used for identifying condition c ategories and cardiac procedure codes are used in identifying planned procedures. Finally, eighteen new pancreatitis codes are relevant when flagging planned readmissions in the 30- day All-Cause Hospital R eadmission measure. 12 Additional information on risk adjustment can be found in the document entitled, \"Risk Adjustment,\" available at the Program/Downloads/2016- RiskAdj -FactSheet.pdf . Additional information on specialty adjustment can be found in the document entitled, \"Specialty Adjustment,\" available at the -Payment/PhysicianFeedbackProgram/Downloads/2016- SpecAdj -FactSheet.pdf . 13 The CMS on QualityNet refers to this process as \"price standardization\" rather than \"payment standardization \"; however, the two terms are equivalent. Last Updated September 2017 15 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR CMS does not include the new I CD-10 codes in algorithms used to compute the quality and cost measures for the 2018 Value Modifier or the 2016 Annual QRURs. Consistent with the Measure Information Forms publicly posted at: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare -Fee- for-Service-Payment/PhysicianFeedbackProgram/2016- QRUR.html , CMS uses the algorithms that accommodate all ICD -10 codes available prior to October 1, 2016 and ar e the same ones used to calculate the benchmarks (see Section II.G for computing measure benchmarks). Depending on the mechanism TINs and eligible professionals used to report quality measures impacted by the new ICD -10 codes, CMS may not have access to the PQRS quality data for certain TIN s. To calculate the Quality Composite Score for such TINs, CMS uses the data reported to the PQRS through another reporting mechanism (if the TIN reported through multiple mechanisms), or only th e claims -based quality outcome measures (if the TIN reported only through the impacted mechanism). F. Determining Which Measures Have the Required Number of Eligible Cases to be included in the 2018 Value Modifier Calculations All quality and cost measures must have a minimum number of eligible cases to be included in the calculation of the 2018 Value Modifier. The minimum number of eligible cases is 20, with two exceptions. The MSPB measure requires at least 125 eligible episodes to be included in the Cost Composite Score. The 30- day All -Cause Hospital Readmission measure requires at least 200 eligible cases to be included in the Quality Composite Score for non- Shared Savings Program ACO TINs and for Shared Savings Program ACO TINs whose ACO did not avoid the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment on their behalf. The 30-day All -Cause Hospital Readmission measure is included in the Quality Composite Score only for TINs with 10 or more eligible professionals. However, the ACO- level 30- day All -Cause Hospital Readmission measure calculated for Shared Savings Program ACO TINs whose ACO avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment on their behalf is included in the Quality Composite Score regardless of case size. All measures that do not have the minimum number of cas es or episodes are calculated and reported in the Annual QRUR for informational purposes only, and they are not included in the composite scores for the Value Modifier . For PQRS measures and non- PQRS QCDR measures reported by in dividual eligible professionals, the total number of eligible cases across all eligible professionals submitting the measure under the TIN and avoiding the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment is used to determine if the minimum case threshold was reached. For measures with multiple performance rates rolled up to a single performance rate based on an equally -weighted mean, the number of eligible cases is the number of eligible cases for any one of the component rates . For measures with multiple performance rates that are rolled up to a single performance rate based on a non- equally - weighted mean of the component rates, the number of eligible cases for the rolled -up measure is the sum of the number of eligible cases for each component rate. For more information about calculating the performance rates for these measures, please refer to Appendix C. G. Computing Measure Benchmarks and Standard Deviations With the exception of the 30- day All -Cause Hospital Readmission measure, the benchmark for each quality measure in the 2018 Value Modifier calculations is the case -weighted national mean performance rate during 2015 (the year prior to the 2016 performance period) among all Last Updated September 2017 16 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR TINs in the measure's peer group. For each quality measure, the peer group is defined as all TINs nationwide that had at least 20 eligible cases for the measure. Benchmarks are calculated for quality measures where at least 20 TINs have at least the minimum number of required eligible cases during 2015. For the calculation of the 2018 Val ue Modifier, PQRS measures that can be reported as electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs ) via EHR and QCDR have separate benchmarks from the non -eCQM versions of the measures .14 Quality measures that do not have a 2015 benchmark (for example, measures new to PQRS in 2016) are not included in the calculation of the Quality Composite Score, but performance on these measures is reported in the 2016 Annual QRUR for informational purposes only. The benchmark for the 30- day All -Cause Hospital Readmission measure is the case - weighted national mean performance rate during 201 5 among all TINs that did not participate in the Shared Savings Program ACO as well as Shared Savings Program ACOs in the measure's peer group. The peer group for the 30- day All -Cause Hospital Readmission measure is defined as all TINs nationwide with 10 or more eligible professionals that had at least 200 eligible cases , and all ACOs in the Shared Savings Program with at least one eligible case. 15 Benchm arks for the CAHPS survey measures are calculated from the 2015 CAHPS for PQRS and 2015 CAHPS for ACOs reporting. The benchmarks include data from ACOs that reported CAHPS measures, even if the ACO did not complete all ACO quality reporting. The peer group for the CAHPS measures is defined as all TINs that reported the CAHPS for PQRS survey and all ACOs that reported the CAHPS for ACOs survey in 2015. Data from ACOs that withdrew from the model are not included in the peer group. Additional information on the quality benchmarks used in the calculation of the 2018 Value Modifier can be found in the document entitled \"Benchmarks for Measures Included in the Performance Year 201 6 Quality and Resource Use Reports,\" available at ear-Benchmarks.pdf . each cost measure is the case -weighted national mean cost during 2016 among all TINs in the measure's peer group. For each of the five total per capita cost measures , the peer group is defined as all TINs nationwide t hat had at least 20 eligible cases for the measure. For the MSPB measure, the peer group is defined as all TINs nationwide that had at least 125 eligible episodes. Benchmarks are calculated for each cost measure where at least 20 TINs have at least the min imum number of required eligible cases (or episodes in the case of the MSPB measure) during 2016. 14 EHR submissions use eCQM versions of PQRS measures. TINs can also submit eCQM versi ons of measures via QCDR based on eCQM measure specifications . All other reporting mechanisms use non -eCQM versions of PQRS measures, including QCDR submissions based on non- eCQM specifications. 15 For all TINs that participated in a Shared Savings Program ACO in 2015, only their ACO -level performance rates, not their TIN -level performance rates, are included in the benchmark for the 30 -day All -Cause Hospital Readmission measure. Last Updated September 2017 17 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR In addition to computing benchmarks, CMS also computes each quality and cost measure's standard deviation. Peer group standard deviations for quality and cost measures are case weighted, with the measure performance rate for each TIN in the peer group receiving a weight equal to the number of eligible cases that the TIN had for the specific measure. As with the benchmarks, the standard deviations for qualit y measures are based on data from 2015 ( the year prior to the 2016 performance period ) and the standard deviations for cost measures are based on data from 2016. H. Standardizing Scores and Computing Domain Scores Standardizing measure performance transforms measures with disparate scales to a common scale, which enables different measures to be compared and combined with one another into a composite. Measure- level performance is standardized by subtracting the benchmark for the measure from the TIN's per capita or per episode cost or quality performance rate and dividing by the case -weighted peer group standard deviation of the measure. A standardized score for a measure reflects the number of standard deviations that a TIN's overall performance differs from the benchmark. Quality and cost domain scores are calculated as the simple (equally -weighted) mean of the TIN's standardized measure scores within the domain, if the TIN has a score for at least one measure included in the quality or cost domain. O nly measures with at least the minimum number of required eligible cases and where benchmarks are available are included in quality and cost domain s cores for the 2018 Value Modifier . A domain score is not computed for any domain in which the TIN does not have at least one measure with at least the minimum number of required eligible cases and for which a benchmark is available. I. Computing Mean Domain Scores and S tandardized Composite Scores For each TIN with at least the minimum number of eligible cases required to compute at least one quality measure with a benchmark for at least one quality domain s core, CMS computes the simple (equally -weighted) mean of the TIN's quality domain s cores. CMS standardizes this score to generate a distribution of mean quality domain s cores centered at a mean of zero with a standard deviation of one . This involves subtracting the peer group mean from each TIN's average domain score and dividing the difference by the peer gr oup standard deviation. For all other TINs, the peer group for the Quality Composite includes all TINs for which a Quality Composite Score could be calculated, with the exception of TINs that participated in the Pioneer ACO Model, Next Generation ACO Model , Oncology Care Model, Comprehensive ESRD Model, or the Comprehensive Primary Care ( CPC) initiative in 2016, as well as TINs that participated in a Shared Savings Program ACO that did not avoid the PQRS payment adjustment on their behalf . The standardized score created through this process is the Quality Composite Score. If a TIN's Quality Composite Score cannot be calculated because the TIN does not have at least the minimum number of required eligible cases for at least one quality measure w ith a benchmark , then the TIN's quality performance is designated as A verag e Quality for the 2018 Value Modifier. The Cost Composite Score is computed analogously to the Quality Composite Score. For each TIN with at least the required minimum number of eligible cases for at least one cost measure with a benchmark for at least one cost domain score, CMS computes the simple Last Updated September 2017 18 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR (equally -weighted) mean of the TIN's cost domain scores. CMS standardizes this score to generate a distribution of m ean cost domain scores centered at a mean of zero with a standard deviation of one. This involves subtracting the peer group mean from each TIN's average domain score and dividing the difference by the peer group standard deviation. For TINs subject to the 2018 Value Modifier, the peer group for the Cost Composite includes all TINs subject to the 2018 Value Modifier for which a Cost Composite Score could be calculated, with the exception of TINs that participated in the Shared Savings Program in 2016. For all other TINs, the peer group for the Cost Composite includes all TINs for which a Cost Composite Score could be calculated , with the exception of TINs that participated in the Shared Savings Program, the Pioneer ACO Model, Next Gene ration ACO Model, Oncology Care Model , Comprehensive ESRD C are Model, or the Comprehensive Primary Care ( CPC) initiative in 2016. The standardized score created through this process is the Cost Composite Score. A Cost Composite Score is not calculated for TINs that do not have at least the minimum number of required eligible cases for at least one cost measure with a benchmark . If a TIN's Cost Composite Score cannot be calculated because the TIN does not have at least the minimum number of required eligible cases for at least one cost measure with a benchmark, then the TIN's cost performance is designated as A verage Cost for the 2018 Value Modifier. J. Categorizing TINs on Q uality and Cost Performance B ased on C omposite Scores and S tatistical Significance (Quality -Tiering) For Category 1 TINs subject to the 2018 Value Modifier that avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment , CMS calculates their Value Modifier using a quality-tiering approach based on the TIN's 2016 quality and cost performance. To be considered either a high or low performer relative to its peers on the Quality Composite Score, a TIN's score must be at least one standard deviation above or below the peer group mean Quality Composite Score and statistically significantly different from the peer group mean. The peer groups are defined above in Section II. I. This ensures that payment adjustments under the Value Modifier are only made to those TINs whose performance reflects a meaningful difference from the mean . A TIN is classified as A verage Quality for purposes of calculating the Value Modifier if (1) the TIN's score is within one standard deviation of the peer group mean, regardless of its statistical significance, (2) the TIN's score is at least one stan dard deviation above or below the peer group mean Quality Composite Score, but the difference between the TIN's score and the mean is not statistically significant , or (3 ) the TIN does not have at least the minimum number of required eligible cases for at least one quality measure with a benchmark . Statistical significance is assessed using a two -tailed test. High, average, and low performance is determined similarly for the Cost Composite Score as for the Quality Composite Score ; however, lower Cost Compos ite Scores indicate better performance. To be considered either a high or low performer relative to its peers on the Cost Composite Score, a TIN's score must be at least one standard deviation above or below the peer group mean Cost Composite Score and sta tistically significantly different from the peer group mean. A TIN is classified as Average Cost for purposes of calculating the Value Modifier if (1) the TIN's score is within one standard deviation of the peer group mean, regardless of its statistical significance, (2) the TIN's score is at least one standard deviation above or below the peer group mean Cost Composite Score, but the difference between the TIN's score and the Last Updated September 2017 19 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR mean is not statistically significant, or (3) the TIN does not have at least the minimum number of required eligible cases for at least one cost measure with a benchmark . For TI Ns that participated in a Shared Savings Program ACO in 2016 that reported quality data through the GPRO Web Interface and avoid ed the 2018 PQRS payment adjust ment , the Quality Composite Score is calculated based on the quality data submitted by the ACO through the GPRO Web Interface and the ACO's performance on the claims- based 30- day All -Cause Hospital Readmission measure calculated by Medicare for 2016. T he Cost Composite Score for these TINs is classified as Average Cost. For TINs that participated in a Shared Savings Program ACO in 2016 that did not avoid the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment, but are Category 1 as a result of reporting quality data to the PQRS outside of the ACO, their Q uality and Cost Composite Scores are calculated and reported in the Annual QRUR for informational purposes only. These TINs are classified as A verage Quality and A verage Cost under the 2018 Value Modifier. Exhibit II.2 below displays the basic structure of the 2018 Value Modifier under the quality- tiering approach. For the 2018 Value Modifier, CMS proposed to hold all Category 1 TINs harmless from any downward payment adjustment. 16 Because the Value Modifier must be budget- neutral, the size of the upward payment adjustments will be based on an Adjustment Factor (AF) calculated to redistribute downward adjustments from Category 2 TINs to the high - performing TINs . The AF is derived from actuarial estimates of p rojected billings and is calculated after the conclusion of the 2016 performance period . It is reflected in the exhibit as the variable AF . Because it is based on the number and relative performance of TINs subject to quality- tiering, it varies from year to year with differences in actuarial estimates. Exhibit II.2. 2018 Value Modifier Payment Adjustments B ased on Q uality - Tiering Low Quality Average Quality High Quality Physicians, PAs, NPs, CNSs, and CRNAs in TINs that are subject to the Value Modifier Low Cost 0.0% +1.0 0.0% 0.0% TINs treating high-risk beneficiaries (based on mean CMS -HCC risk scores) are eligible for an additional adjustment of +1.0 x AF. The 2018 Value Modifier will be applied on a claim- by-claim basis to claims for services paid under the Medicare PFS and for which the Medicare provider has accepted assignment. A claim adjustment reason code (CARC) and a remittance advice remark code (RARC) are code sets used to report payment adjustments on an eligible professional 's or group practice's Remittance Advice. The Value Modifier program currently uses CARC 237 - 16 This policy is proposed in the 2018 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Proposed Rule (82 FR 34125). Last Updated September 2017 20 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR Legislated/Regulatory Penalty, to designate the application of a negative or downward payment adjustment. At least one remark code must be provided (may be comprised of either the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs Reject Reason Code, or RARC that is not an alert ) in combination with the Value Modifier RARC \"VBM - N70 1 - Payment adjusted based on the Value-based Payment Modifier.\"17 K. Assessing Whether the TIN Treats a Disproportionate Share of Beneficiaries with High-R isk Scores TINs receiving an upward payment adjustment are eligible for an additional +1.0 x AF upward adjustment if the mean CMS -HCC risk score of the TIN's attributed beneficiaries is at or above the 75th percentile of all beneficiary risk scores nationwide. The 2015 CMS -HCC risk scores are calculated by CMS and are used to measure the mean risk of each TIN's attributed beneficiaries. For TINs that did not participate in a Shared Savings Program ACO in 2016, this includes the beneficiaries attributed to the TIN for the claims -based quality outcome and cost measures. TINs participating in a Shared Savings Program ACO in 2016 that are receiving an upward adjustment are eligible for an additional +1.0 x AF upward adjustment if the beneficiary population assigned to the ACO under the Shared Savings Program has a mean beneficiary CMS -HCC risk score at o r above the 75th percentile of all beneficiary CMS -HCC risk scores nationwide. The risk score assigned to each Medicare beneficiary predicts the beneficiary's medical costs in 2016 relative to mean costs among all Medicare FFS beneficiaries nationwide bas ed on the presence of factors known to affect costs and utilization. A score of 1.0 represents average risk, with higher scores corresponding to higher risk. T he 2015 CMS -HCC risk score distribution, spanning the lowest beneficiary risk score to the highest beneficiary risk score, and percentile thresholds were determined for all Medicare FFS beneficiaries nationally . Mean risk scores for beneficiaries attributed to TINs subject to the Value Modifier were compared with these national thresholds to determine whether the beneficiaries attributed to a TIN had a mean risk score that was at or above the 75th percentile. L. Computation of Budget -Neutral Adjustment Factor (AF) For the CMS Office of the Actuary (OACT) to compute the budget- neutral AF for the 2018 Value Modifier , OACT must estimate the total value of both upward and downward payment adjustments under the V alue Modifier in 2018. OACT 's calculations are based on a file of claim line amounts paid to physician s in 2016 under the M edicare PFS, aggregated to the TIN level . Prior to performing these calculations, CMS removes any payment adjustments resulting from incentive payment programs such as the Value Modifier , Medicare EHR Incentive Program, and PQRS adjustments . This file includes information about which TINs are subject to a n upward, 17 Further information can be found in the document entitled \" Understanding 2018 Medicare Quality Program Payment Adjustments ,\" available at the following URL: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality -Initiatives -Patient - Assessment -Instruments/PQRS/Downloads/Understand2018MedicarePayAdjs.pdf . Last Updated September 2017 21 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR neutral, or downward payment adjustment under the 2018 V alue Modifier . Line items are considered to have been paid under the M edicare PFS if the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System ( HCPCS ) code and modifiers on the claim line are associated with any of the following status codes: Active (A), Carriers Price the Code (C), Anesthesia Services (J), Restricted Coverage (R), or Injec tions (T). Certain pathology codes18 are paid under the Medicare PFS onl y if the line item includes a modifier value of 26 (professional component); otherwise, they are paid under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule and thus are not included in the billings sum. The status codes associated with HCPCS and HCPC S/modifier combin ations are found in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Relative Value File.19 M. Value Modifier Informal Review Policies For TINs that are subject to the 2018 Value Modifier, CMS has established an Informal Review period f or TINs to request a correction of a perceived error in their Value Modifier calculation after the release of the QRURs. CMS has established policies under four scenarios to determine how the Q uality and Cost Composites under the V alue Modifier would be affected as a result of Informal Review decisions or if unanticipated issues were to arise ( for example, errors made by a third -party such as a vendor or errors in CMS' calculation of the Quality and/or Cost Composites are identified ). Exhibit II.3 below summarizes the four scenarios. Exhibit II.3 . Quality and Cost Composite Status for TINs d ue to Informal Review Decisions and Widespread Quality and Cost Data Issues Scenario 1: TIN s Moving from Category 2 to Category 1 as a R esult of PQRS or V alue Modifier Informal Review Process Scenario 2: Non -GPRO Category 1 TINs with Additional Eligible Professionals Avoiding PQRS Payment Adjustment as a R esult of PQRS Informal Review Process Scenario 3: Category 1 TINs with Widespread Quality Data Issues Scenario 4: Category 1 TINs with Wide spread Claims Data Issues .

Last Updated September 2017 22 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR Scenario 1: TINs Moving from Category 2 to Category 1 as a result of PQRS or Value Modifier Informal Review Process For the 2018 Value Modifier, if a TIN is initially classified as Category 2 and subsequently, through the PQRS or Value Modifier I nformal Review proc ess, it is reclassified as Category 1, then the TIN's Q uality C omposite will be classified as A verage Q uality. The TIN's Cost Composite will be calculated using the quality -tiering methodology. If the TIN is classified as High Cost based on its performance on the cost measures, then the TIN's Cost C omposite will be reclassified as Average C ost. If the TIN is classified as A verage Cost or L ow Cost, then the TIN will retain the calculated cost tier designation. Scenario 2: Non-GPRO Category 1 TINs with Additional Eligible Professionals Avoiding PQRS Payment Adjustment as a result of PQRS Informal Review Process If a TIN is classified as Category 1 for the 2018 Value Modifier by having at least 50 percent of the T IN's eligible professionals avoid the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as individuals, and subsequently, through the PQRS I nformal R eview process, it is determined that additional eligible professionals that are in the TIN also avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment as individuals, then the following policies will be used to determine the TIN's Quality and Cost Composite s: If the TIN's Q uality C omposite is initially classified as Low Quality, then the TIN's Quality C omposite will be reclassified as A verage Quality . If the TIN's Q uality C omposite is initially classified as A verage Q uality or High Q uality , then the TIN will retain that quality tier designation. The TIN's Cost C omposite that was initially calculated will be maintained. Scenario 3: Category 1 TINs with Widespread Quality Data Issues In cases where there is a systematic issue with any of a Category 1 TIN's quality data that renders it unusable for calculating a TIN's Quality Composite , the TIN's Quality Composite will be classified as Average Quality . CMS considers widespread quality data issues as issues that impact multiple TINs and for which CMS is unable to determine the accuracy of the data submitted via these TINs. The TIN's Cost Composite will be calculated using th e quality -tiering methodology. If the TIN is classified as High Cost based on its performance on the cost measures, then the TIN's Cost Composite will be reclassified as Average Cost. If the TIN is classified as Average Cost or Low Cost , then the TIN will retain the calculated cost tier designation. Scenario 4: Category 1 TINs with Widespread Claims Data Issues If CMS determines after the release of the QRURs that there is a widespread claims data issue that impacts the calculation of the Quality and/or Cost Composites for Category 1 TINs, then the Quality and Cost Composite s for affected TINs will be recalculated. CMS considers widespread claims data issues as issues that impact multiple TINs and require the recalculation of the Quality and/or Cost Composite s. Last Updated September 2017 23 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR After recalculating the composites, if the TIN's Quality Composite is classified as Low Quality , then the Quality Composite will be reclassified as Average Quality . If the TIN's Cost Composite is classified as High Cost, then the Cost Composite will be reclassified as Average Cost. If the TIN is classified as Average Quality , High Quality , Average Cost , or Low Cost, then the TIN will retain the calculated quality or cost tier designation. Additional Upward Adjustment for the Treatment of Comple x Beneficiaries Under Scenarios 1 and 3, for TINs classified as Average Quality /Low Cost as a result of Informal Review, an additional +1.0 x AF upward payment adjustment will be applied to TINs if the mean CMS -HCC risk score of the TIN's attributed beneficiaries is at or above the 75th percentile of all beneficiary risk scores nationwide. Under Scenarios 2 and 4, for TINs classified as High Quality /Low Cost , High Quality /Average Cost, or Average Quality /Low Cost as a result of Informal Review, an additiona l +1.0 x AF upward payment adjustment will be applied if the mean CMS -HCC risk score of the TIN's attributed beneficiaries is at or above the 75th percentile of all beneficiary risk scores nationwide. Last Updated September 2017 24 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR III. COMPUTATION OF ADDITIONAL STATISTICS The 2016 Annual QRUR s include tables to help report recipients better understand their TINs' quality and cost performance. These include data on hospital admissions for any cause, costs disaggregated by type of service, and medical professionals' specialties. This section describes the computational details behind these statistics. A. Hospital Admissions for Any Cause Because hospital costs are a large portion of per capita costs, Table 2B accompanying the 2016 Annual QRUR identifies hospitals that accounted for at least five percent of a TIN's attributed beneficiary hospital stays during 2016 to help TINs understand their per capita costs. CMS identifies beneficiary hospital stays by looking at admissions for beneficiaries attributed to each TIN via the two -step attribution process for per capita cost measures and claims -based quality outcome measures. 20 CMS identifies the names, CMS Certification Numbers (CCNs), and locations (city and state) of these hospitals by combining information from the Provider of Service files and PECOS . Table 2C accompanying the 2016 Annual QRUR identifies each beneficiary -level hospital admission for beneficiaries attributed to each TIN via the two -step attribution process. Individual attributed b eneficiaries are identified by an index variable, based on health insurance claim (HIC) number, sex, and date of birth, which allows users to link beneficiary -level information across tables without using personally identifiable information. Each hospital stay listed also indicates the date of discharge and discharge disposition based on the two- digit patient discharge status code on t he last claim in a hospital stay (Exhibit III.1). CMS provides similar information to help TINs understand hospital admissions reflected in the MSPB measure based on beneficiary MSPB episodes attributed to a TIN. However, admissions are reported for benefi ciary MSPB episodes attributed to a TIN via the MSPB attribution rule instead of the two -step attribution process. Table 5A accompanying the 2016 Annual QRUR identifies hospitals that accounted for at least five percent of beneficiary MSPB episodes attributed to the TIN through the MSPB attribution rule during 2016. Table 5B accompanying the 2016 Annual QRUR provides information on the beneficiaries attributed to the TIN for the MSPB measure. Hospital admissions with a principal diagnosis for conditions associated with alcohol and substance abuse are excluded from all patient -level data on hospital admissions for purposes of confidentiality but are included in total counts of hospital admissions in the Annual QRUR Table 2B. 20 For additional information about the two -step attribution process, please refer to the document entitled \" Two-Step Attribution for Claims -Based Quality Outcome Measures and Per Capita Cost Measures Included in the Value Modifier ,\" available at 2017 25 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR Exhibit III.1.

Last Updated September 2017 26 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR B. Categorical Breakdown of Costs by T ype of S ervice Several tables accompanying the 2016 Annual QRUR \u2014one for each of the six cost measures \u2014provide a breakdown of the TIN's per capita or per episode costs in comparison to peers by type of service. Types of service include inpatient services and evaluation and management (E&M), among others. Each category of service includes the costs of all services in that category that were furnished to the TIN's attributed beneficiaries and included in the cost measure (not only those services provided by the TIN). Taken together, these category of service amounts add up to the per capita or per episode cost measure value, to allow TINs to identify more readily which categories were particular drivers of their measure -level costs. The specific tables are Table 3A: Per Capita Costs, by Categories of Service, for the Per Capita Costs for All Attributed Beneficiaries Measure; Tables 4A - 4D: Per Capita Costs, by Categories of Service, for Beneficiaries with Specific Conditions; and Table 5C: Costs per Episode, by Category of Service, for the Medicare Spending per Beneficiary (MSPB) Measure. These data are reported for informational purposes to help TINs better understand what is driving their beneficiaries' costs; they are not used individually in calculations of the Cost Composite Score. In addition to separating costs by service category, services are further broken down based on whether the service was provided by eligible professionals in the TIN or by eligible professionals in another TIN for two categories : E&M services and procedures in non- emergency settings. For each of these two categories, service costs are further divided by the broad specialty category of the eligible professionals rendering them: primary care physicians (PCPs), medical specialists, surgeons, and other (including PAs , NPs , CNSs psychologists, dieticians, audiologists, physical and occupational therapists, and speech language therapists). The method for determining an eligible professional's specialty is described in the next section ( Section III.C ). To ensure that the costs displayed across all categories of service for a given TIN sum to the actual per capita or per ep isode cost measure amount for that TIN, costs for each category of service are scaled by a multiplier equal to the ratio of the TIN's st andardized, risk-adjusted, and specialty -adjusted cost measure to the TIN's standardized but not r isk-adjusted and not specialty- adjusted costs. For example, suppose for Per Capita Costs for Beneficiaries with Diabetes, a TIN's payment-standardized but not risk -adjusted costs for its attributed beneficiaries with diabetes are $10,000, $2,000 of which is due to E&M and $8,000 of which is due to inpatient services. Suppose further that the TIN's risk - and specialty -adjusted costs for this measure are $15,000. These costs are 1.5 times higher than the TIN's corresponding unadjusted costs of $10,000. Rescaling the costs for the E&M and inpatient services categories by that factor of 1.5\u2014to $3,000 and $12,000, respectively\u2014results in a distribution of costs acros s categories for the TIN that adds up to the measure- level cost while preserving the share of those costs due to E&M and inpatient services, respectively, that is reflected in the unadjusted costs. Appendix D provides more detail on how Medicare claims are categorized into the mutually exclusive service categories for the per capita cost measures displayed in Exhibit D.1. Exhibit D.2 displays how cost categories are defined for the MSPB measure. Exhibits III. 2 and III.3 list the categories of services displayed in the 2016 QRURs and tables. The disaggregated statistics relate to the measure scores as follows: Last Updated September 2017 27 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR Exhibit III.2.

Physicians and N onphysician Eligible Professionals Billing Under the TIN In order to attribute beneficiaries to TINs for the per capita cost measures and for the three claims -based quality outcome measures, CMS takes into account the level of primary care services received (as measured by Medicare -allowed charges during 2016) and the provider specialties that performed these services ( PCPs , specialists, NPs , PAs , and CNSs ). Information on eligible professionals ' medical specialties is also used in category -of-service breakdowns, as described above. CMS uses the following broad specialty categories for the category -of-service breakdowns: PCP , medical specialist, surgeon, and other eligible professional. CMS uses the two-digit CMS specialty codes that appear on Medicare carrier claims files to define specialties. The Medicare Claims Processing Manual delineates which specialties are physician specialties and which are not. Assignment of medical professionals to broad specialty categories, referred to here as professional stratification categories, comprises two steps. First, each provider is assigned a medical specialty. Second, each specialty is assigned a professional stratification category . Last Updated September 2017 29 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR The CMS specialty codes that appear on Medicare carrier claims files reflect self -reported specialties recorded in PECOS. To account for changes in specialties or multiple PECOS enrollments during a performance year, CMS determines the specialty from CMS carrier claims files based on the CMS specialty code associated with the plurality of total allowed charges on line items for services rendered by the professional during 2016. In the case of a tie, the specialty listed on the most recent claim is selected. Appendix E provides a mapping from CMS specialty codes to physician, eligible professional, and professional stratification categories. Last Updated September 2017 30 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services APPENDIX A DESCRIPTION OF DATA SOURCES Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR CMS uses multiple data sources, described briefly below, to calculate the quality and cost measures included in the 2018 Value Modifier. A more detailed discussion of how these sources are used in specific quality and cost measures is available in the Measure Information Forms available at the following URL: https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare -Fee-for-Service - Payment/PhysicianFeedbackProgram/2016 -QRUR.html . A. Quality Measure Data Reported by Groups and Individual Eligible Professionals PQRS reporting and performance data included in the 2018 Value Modifier and displayed in the 2016 Annual QRURs are obtained from PQRS in a Universal Data Set (UDS). PQRS data from calendar year 2016 are used for the 2016 Annual QRUR and 2018 Value Modifier. The data include information on measures submitted by TINs as groups (through the GPRO) and individual eligible professionals, by TIN, including which measures were submitted, number of cases submitted, number of exclusions, number of cases that met the relevant measure criteria, and performance rates. The UDS contains similar data for non- PQRS QCDR measures. The UDS data also include information on which TINs and individual eligible professionals avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment and the reporting mechanism(s) by which the measures were submitted: Medicare Part B claims, qualified PQRS registry, direct CEHRT, CEHRT via data submission vendor, QCDR, or GPRO Web Interface. For TINs that reported CAHPS for PQRS survey measures and elect ed to have them included in the calculation of their V alue Modifier, and for Shared Savings Program ACO participant TINs whose ACOs report ed CAHPS for ACOs measures and avoided the 2018 PQRS payment adjustment, CMS uses CAHPS survey data collected by CMS -certified CAHPS survey vendors in the performance year. Like the other PQRS data, the CAHPS data include information on number of responses and performance rate. They also include additional information needed to incorporate CAHPS measures into the 2018 Value Modifier for TINs electing that option, such as CAHPS -specific standard errors. B. Medicare Enrollment Data CMS uses Medicare Part A and Part B enrollment data to attribute beneficiaries to TINs for the three claims -based quality outcome measures and six cost measures included in the 2018 Value Modifier. Medicare enrollment data from calendar year 2016 are used for the 2016 Annual QRUR and 2018 Value Modifier. These data contain demographic and enrollment information about each beneficiary enrolled in Medicare during a calendar year. The data include the beneficiary's unique Medicare identifier, state and county residence codes, zip code, date of birth, date of death, sex, race/ethnicity, age, monthly Medicare entitlement indicators, reasons for entitle ment, whether the beneficiary's state of residence paid for the beneficiary's Medicare Part A or Part B monthly premiums (\"state buy -in\"), and monthly Medicare managed care enrollment indicators. These variables help determine whether a given beneficiary s hould be attributed to a TIN. For example, beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare managed care or living outside the U.S., its territories, and its possessions are excluded from the claims-based measures included in the Value Modifier. The enroll ment data are accessed via CMS' Integrated Data Repository (IDR). The denominator table, updated quarterly, is accessed via the Medicare Enrollment Database. The beneficiary table, updated daily, is accessed via the Common Medicare Environment. Last Updated September 2017 A.2 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR C. Medicare Claims Data For the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 Annual QRURs, computations for the three claims -based quality outcome measures and six cost measures use all final action Medicare claims for services provided during the performance period. Specifically, CMS analyzes inpatient hospital ; outpatient hospital ; SNF ; home health ; hospice ; carrier (physician/supplier ); and durable medical equipment (DME), prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) claims, as appropriate for the relevant measure. These claims are identified from CMS' IDR based on at least a 90 -day runout period. The date on which the claims are identified is the Wednesday following the first Saturday that occurs more than 90 days after the end of the performance period. This ensures that there is enough time for claims from the last few days of the run -out period to have been uploaded to the IDR during the weekly updates. 21 Under Medicare procedures, when an error is discovered on a claim, a duplicate claim is submitted indicating that the prior claim was in error; a subsequent claim containing the corrected information can then be submitted. The National Claims History database is the source of Medicare FFS claims in the IDR. The IDR contains only the final action claims developed from the Medicare Nat ional Claims History database \u2014that is, non- rejected claims for which a payment has been made after all disputes and adjustments have been resolved and details clarified \u2014and these are the claims used to populate the Annual QRUR and calculate the Value Modif ier. The scope of claims i n the IDR is national. Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) submit data continually to CMS, which updates the IDR weekly as noted above. TINs submit claims to their MAC for processing and payment. For the purpose of computing the Value Modifier, the end date of the claim determines the performance period with which the claim is associated. D. Other Data CMS -HCC risk scores. Derived from Medicare enrollment and claims data, CMS -HCC risk scores are used to (1) risk adjust the Per Capita Costs for All Attributed Beneficiaries and Per Capita Costs for Beneficiaries with Specific Conditions measures 22 and (2) determine which high-performing TINs are eligible for an additional upward payment adjustment if their mean beneficiary C MS-HCC risk score is at or above the 75th percentile of all beneficiary risk scores nationwide. Final risk scores for the 2018 Value Modifier are obtained directly from the contractor that produces these scores for CMS. CMS -HCC risk scores from calendar year 2015 21 Specifically, CMS calculates the date that is 90 days after the close of the performance period. If the dates falls on a weekday, all claims through at least that date are captured the following Tuesday and claims are locked the following Wednesday. If th e date falls on a weekend, the data are captured a week later (two Wednesdays after the 90-day runout). 22 For additional details about the risk adjustment methodology for the per capita cost measures, see the per capita cost Measure Information Forms available at the following URL : https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare- Fee-for- Service -Payment/PhysicianFeedbackProgram/2016- QRUR.html . Last Updated September 2017 A.3 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR (2016 Final Model scores using Version 22) are used for the 2016 Annual QRUR and 2018 Value Modifier. Standardized payments. Standardized Medicare allowed charges are used for the cost measures included in the 2018 Value Modifier. These data associate a standardized amount with each actual allowed amount for each service billed by Medicare providers. These data are obtained directly from the contractor responsible for producing CMS' agency -wide standardized payments. Standardized payments data from calendar year 2016 are used for the 2016 Annual QRUR and 2018 Value Modifier. 23 PECOS. PECOS data are used to develop an initial list of TINs that could be subject to the 2018 Value Modifier, based on the number of eligible professionals associated with the TIN in PECOS as of July 16, 2016. The PECOS database includes information on enrolled eligible professionals, including their NPIs, any TINs to which they have reassigned their billing rights, and their primary and secondary specialties (if applicable). PECOS data were obtained by querying the PECOS reporting database 10 calendar days after the 2016 PQRS GPRO registration period end ed. Pioneer ACO Model, Next Generation ACO Model, Oncology Care Model, Comprehensive E SRD Care Model, and Comprehensive Primary Care ( CPC ) initiative participation lists. To assess which TINs will be exempt from the 2018 Value Modifier because eligible professionals billing under the TIN participated in the Pioneer ACO Model , Next Generati on ACO Model, Oncology Care Model , Comprehensive E SRD C are Model, or the Comprehensive Primary Care ( CPC) initiative during 2016, TIN -level and TIN -NPI-level participation lists are obtained directly from the contractors supporting these programs and initiatives. 23 Additional details relating to the payment -standardization algorithm are available at the following URL : http://www.qualitynet.org/dcs/Con tentServer?c=Page&pagename=QnetPublic%2FPage%2FQnetTier4&cid=122877 2057350.

Las t Updated September 2017 C.11 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services APPENDIX D METHOD FOR DEFINING SERVICE CATEGORIES Detailed Methodology for the 2018 Value Modifier and the 2016 QRUR For the purposes of reporting cost breakdowns by category of service for the per capita cost measures (shown in Tables 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D of the Annual QRUR), e ach Medicare claim for an attributed beneficiary is categorized into one of the service categories displayed in Exhibit D.1. Claim costs are included in a given service category based on the claim type, Berenson -Eggers Type of Service (BETOS) code, place of service, type of bill, type of service, HCPCS m odifier, and/or provider type. For the purposes of reporting cost breakdowns by category of service for the MSPB measure (shown in Tables 5C and 5D of the Annual QRUR) , each claim associated with an MSPB episode is categorized into one of the service categories displayed in Exhibit D.2. Episode costs are included in a given service category based on the claim type, BETOS code, claim criteria, and provider type. CMS assigns a BETOS code to each HCPCS code that might appear on a carrier or outpatient hospital claim. CMS developed the BETOS coding system primarily for analyzing the growth in Medicare expenditures. The coding system covers all HCPCS codes, assigns a HCPCS code to one, and only one, BETOS code, consists of readily understood clinical cate gories (as opposed to statistical or financial categories), consists of categories that permit objective assignment, is stable over time, and is relatively immune to minor changes in technology or practice patterns.
