Crystals and stones have long been used in healing rituals because of their ability to vibrate on an extremely pure level. Each crystal holds its own geometric pattern which mimics those found in our body and in nature. When a charged crystal is placed close to the body, the energy waves or frequency of the body tries to tune into the crystal, which in turn helps to stimulate healing. Using crystals for self-healing is an extremely valuable tool and is very easy. It all starts with your intention. Hold your crystal, quiet your mind and offer your intention to the crystal such as- \"I wish to use this crystal to help stimulate the healing of......\" Then choose a Charging Method (use your intuition to guide you to the best and most appropriate method): 1.) Sunlight or Moonlight: Crystals can be charged using the rays of the sun or moon as they are both very energizing. This method can also be adopted to cleanse your crystals of negative energy. Place your crystal in the direct line of moon or sun light for 24 hours. (Some crystals may fade in the Sun such as amethyst, so be mindful of this.) Placing your crystals out on a new or full Moon can also be a lot more potent- place them out on a Full Moon to signify endings and a New Moon for beginnings. The moonlight method works well with all stones and crystals. 2.) Charging Stones: Some crystals and stones are naturally charging such as selenite and quartz. You can place other crystals on top of these cleansing stones for 24 hours or until their energy is purified. Alternatively, you can use smaller pieces of cleansing crystals such as quartz and use them to surround the crystal you want to charge in a circle. This is particularly beneficial for yellow, orange, red, grey and white stones. 3.) Nature Method: Place your crystal in a healthy garden or in a flower pot with lots of healthy, fresh leaves growing. Charge it up for 24 hours. This is particularly beneficial for green, white, orange, yellow or pink colored stones. 4.) Grounding Method: Bury your crystal into the ground for 24 hours, or up to a week depending on the energy you want to infuse. This is particularly beneficial for earthy stones that are dark in color such as black, green, brown, deep reds and greys. 5.) Sound/Reiki: Reiki or sound bowls can also help charge crystals with positive energy. Simply practice reiki over your crystal or create a sound bath using singing bowls or gongs. This is particularly beneficial for blue, purple, pink and white stones. Whichever way you decide to charge your crystals remember to set your intention and open your mind and heart to receiving their healing vibration. Also remember to give thanks and gratitude towards your crystal. A Note on Choosing the Perfect Crystal for You: there are many resources out there on particular crystals and the healing benefits that they offer however, one of the best ways to choose a crystal is to follow your intuition. If you have an intention in mind, set it before you walk into the store or alternatively, ask to be guided to the perfect crystal for you. This often creates a more powerful healing experience. "}
