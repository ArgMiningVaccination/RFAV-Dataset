Jong1,2*, Mats U. Jong2and Erik 1Department Healthcare and Nutrition, Louis Bolk Institute, Driebergen, The Netherlands 2Department Health Sciences, Mid Sweden University, Sundsvall, Sweden ABSTRACT Purpose Medicinal solutions for injection are frequently applied in anthroposophic medicine and homeopathy. Despite their extensive use, there is little data published on the safety of these products. Therefore, we investigated the safety of anthroposophic and homeopathic solutionsfor injection through a systematic evaluation of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Methods ADRs were extracted from the pharmacovigilance databases of eight German manufacturers. Analysed ADRs included case reports in humans only, (spontaneous) case reports from post-marketing surveillance, literature and clinical/safety trials.Results Between 2000 and 2009, in total, 303 million ampoules for injection were sold, and 486 case reports were identi ed, corresponding to a total number of 1180 ADRs. Of all case reports, 71.8% (349/486) included ADRs that were listed (e.g. stated in package leaflet), and 9.5% (46/486) of the reports were classi ed as serious. The most frequently reported ADRs were pruritus, followed by angioe- dema, diarrhoea and erythema. A total of 27.3% (322/1180) were localized reactions for example; application or injection site erythema, pain, swelling and in flammation. The overall reporting rate of ADRs associated with injections was less than 4 per 1 million sold ampoules and classi ed as very rare. Conclusions Our systematic evaluation demonstrated that the reporting rate of ADRs associated with anthroposophic and homeopathic solutions for injection is very low. Most reported ADRs were listed, and one quarter consisted of local reactions. These ndings suggest a low risk pro le for solutions for injection as therapeutically applied in anthroposophic medicine and homeopathy.

Homeopathy was developed more than 200 years ago by Samuel Hahnemann. It is based onthe principles of similars, meaning that a disease can be cured by a substance that produces similar symp- toms in healthy people. The therapeutic use of paren-teral administration forms in homeopathy was rstdescribed in the 19 thcentury.2Anthroposophic medicine is a system of medicine based on the spiritual science that was developed by Rudolf Steiner and ItaWegman. In 1923/24, Steiner 3,4recommended injec- tions as one of the main routes of administration for anthroposophic medication. Nowadays, more than 90million medicinal ampoules are sold per year world- wide. German anthroposophic and homeopathic man- ufacturers produce over 90% of these ampoules. 5 Previous studies have shown that anthroposophic and homeopathic practitioners often favor the paren- teral dosage form as their rst choice in the treatment of acute and chronic diseases.6,7Reasons for this pref- erence are the anticipated better clinical effect of injec- tions, the possibility to control compliance and that theexact location of administration can be chosen.

More than 98% of the practitioners never to rarely observed any adverse reaction caused by the injections. Those men-tioned were local redness, haematoma, local pain and allergic reactions. 7Marketing authorisation holders are obliged to collect and evaluate reports on possibledrug-related adverse events. A rst evaluation in three German homeopathic and anthroposophic pharmacov- igilance databases reported a low number of adversereactions on solutions for injection in the period 1990 and 1999; approximately one per nine million sold doses. 8Pharmacovigilance procedures and sys- tems have been signi cantly improved over the years. Electronic reporting systems became mandatory for serious case reports, and guidelines for pharmacovigi-lance were published. 12The aim of the present study was to update the safety status of anthroposophic and homeopathic solutions for injection. Comparedto other dosage forms, systematic evaluations on the safety of these parenteral dosage forms are currently lacking. METHODS Data extraction Retrospective evaluation of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) documented in the pharmacovigilance data-bases of eight German manufacturers from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2009 was carried out. Of the eight participating manufacturers, six were homeo-pathic manufacturers, and two were anthroposophic manufacturers, all together covering an estimated 94% of the total sales of anthroposophic and homeo-pathic solutions for injection on the German market. Inclusion criteria for data extraction were: All ADRs (terminology see ICH-E2A guidelines 13) that were listed in the pharmacovigilance databases of the partic- ipating companies for which regulatory reporting was required. This included ADRs for which the causalrelationship to drug intake was unlikely, not stated or unknown, since a possible relation to drug intakecould not be excluded. The causal relationship between the adverse event and drug administration was de ned according to Uppsala Monitoring Centre guidelines 14and categorized as certain, probable/ likely, possible, unlikely, conditional/unclassi ed, unassessable/unclassi able; ADRs that were associ- ated with parenteral dosage forms and with Germany as country of occurrence; ADRs reported between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2009; ADRsreported by health care professionals and patients (both medically con rmed and medically non con rmed) and ADRs reported from post-marketing surveillance,clinical/safety studies, as well as case reports identi ed from literature. Excluded from data extraction were ADRs from products with active ingredients not pre-pared according to the according to the Hom\u00f6opathisches Arznei Buch (HAB 1) and ADRs from products for which it was clear that they were applied orally. ADRs were evaluated using a systematic data extraction protocol including details on product category: (i) single product = one active ingredient, orcomplex product = more than one active ingredient; (ii) calculated dilution of active substance ( <1:10.000 or1:10.000) to analyse whether ADRs occurred more frequently with less diluted substances compared to highly diluted substances; (iii) route of parenteral administration (subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrave-nous, intracutaneous, intraarticular, periarticular); (iv) (1, 2, 10 ml) to analyse possible dose-dependency in the occurrence of ADRs;(v) date of onset; (vi) source of report (spontaneous, literature, clinical studies/safety studies not published, other; such as registries, poison information centre);(vii) reporter quali cations (health professional, patient; report medically not tion of ADR; of ADR. Criteria for serious ADRs were: Death/life threatening, in patient hospitalization, persistent disability, anomalies/birthdeciency or medical important event; (x) listedness of ADR per case report; and (xi) gender and age of patients. All ADRs were coded in MedDRA includingallocations to the system organ class (SOC). Data analysis Data were extracted from the pharmacovigilance data- bases from May to September 2010, using a dataextraction Excel form and transferred to the SPSS database (IBM, SPSS (PASW) Statistics version 18,0, Somers, NY, USA). Tabulation of the differentcategories of ADRs was performed by descriptive analysis. Pearson 's Chi-square tests were used tom. c. jong et al. Copyright \u00a9 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety (2012) DOI: 10.1002/pdsanalyse differences between the ADR subgroups, and a p-value of <0.05 was regarded as indicating a statisti- cally signi cant difference. The reporting rate of ADRs of injections was calculated as the sum of ADRs reported in 10 years, per (total) amount of ampoules sold in the same period. Total sales of the number of units(ampoules) in the period of 2000 -2009 were provided by each participating manufacturer. Depending on their reporting rate, ADR reports were classi ed into very common ( very (<0.01%). RESULTS ADR reporting The majority of manufacturers ( ve out of eight) had systemically evaluated ADRs between January 1, 2000and December 31, 2009. One manufacturer had data available for an 8-year period (2002 -2009), one manu- facturer for 6 years (2004 -2009) and one manufacturer for 3 years (2007 -2009). As shown in Figure 1, the total number of ampoules sold in Germany slightly decreased as from 2005, averaging about 28.8 million ampouleson a yearly basis during the last 5 years. The annual total number of ADRs is depicted in Figure 2. There were signi cantly more case reports in the last three years, 2007 -2009, compared to the previous period and when adjusted for the varying periods of reporting ( p<0.001). Characteristics of ADRs Out of 486 case reports, 1180 ADRs were reported since some patients experienced more than one ADR per case report (Table 1). The overall reporting rateof ADRs with injections in the period 2000 -2009 was calculated as 3.89 per million ampoules and classi ed as very rare. Although the reporting rate for the last 3 years (2007 -2009) was doubled in comparison to the 10-year period, e.g. 8.07 per million ampoules, it was still categorized as very rare. All 486 case reports represented 161 individual products for injection(some products appeared more than once in the pharmacovigilance database). 9.5% (46/486) of all product-related case reports were serious.

Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety (2012) DOI: 10.1002/pdsof 0.15 per million ampoules. The majority (71.8%) (349/486) of case reports included ADRs that were listed, e.g. the ADR was listed in the Summary of Prod-uct Characteristics or package lea flet (Table 1). Most cases (94%) were reported spontaneously and by health- care professionals (73.5%). The majority of ADRs(57.6%; 280/486) occurred in adults (19 -64 years). 27.1% (132/486) was reported in patients over 65 years. Few ADRs were reported in children till 18 years of age(2.5%; 12/486). In 12.8% (62/486) of the cases, the age was unknown. Theve most frequently reported ADRs were pruri- tus, angioedema (swelling of dermis or subcutaneous tissue), diarrhoea, erythema and nausea (Table 2). Most ADRs reported were classi ed as skin and sub- cutaneous tissue disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions. 27.3% (322/1180) of all reported ADRs was a local reaction, coded asapplication or injection site erythema, pain, swelling, inflammation, itching (results not shown). Characteristics of serious ADRs ADRs were classi ed as serious when patients in ques- tion of cases; 4/46). In almost half of the case reports of serious ADRs, a causal relation to injection of the medication wasassessed as unlikely (48%) (22/46). In 37% (17/46), the causal relationship was assessed as possible, in 13% (6/46) as probable. For one case, an assessmentwas impossible to make. The 46 serious ADRs were reported with 31 individual products. For most pro- ducts (65%) (20/31), one serious ADR was reported.Per individual product, reporting rates of serious ADRS ranged from 29.1 (highest) to 0.08 (lowest)per million ampoules. The outcome of the serious ADRs was in most cases unknown (43.5%) (20/46). 23.9% (11/46) of patients with (4/46) were recovering and 23.9% (11/46) had (8.7%) (4/46) were labelled as the ve most frequently reported serious ADRs. Most frequent SOCs for serious ADRS were musculo- skeletal and connective tissue disorders (6.5%) The brain stem infarction was reported in one patientonly. This was presented within the database as four separate case reports since the patient was injected simultaneously with four different products. This seri-ous ADR was assessed as possibly related to injection of the medication. With aphthous stomatitis (causality assessment; unlikely) and cerebral ischemia (causalityassessment; possible), the serious ADR also occurred in one patient only, which was injected simultaneously with four individual products. Further analyses werecarried out to determine the reporting rates of serious ADRs as compared to non-serious ADRs in the differ- ent subgroups and product categories. Case reports ofserious ADRs occurred signi cantly more frequently as compared to those of non-serious ADRs in (i) male subjects, (ii) subjects of 65 years and older, (iii) uponinjection with complex products, (iv) with products of a dilution <1:10.000 and (v) upon intramuscular injection (Table 3). In these speci c subgroups, report- ing rates for serious ADRs were low, ranging from 0.03 to 0.15 per million ampoules. DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this is the rst study that provided a thorough evaluation of collected and spontaneous reported ADRs for parenteral dosage forms of anthro- posophic and homeopathic medications. Between2000 and 2009, 486 cases were identi ed in Germany with a total of 1180 reported ADRs. In relation to the overall sales data of ampoules within that period(303 million), the reporting rate of ADRs as associated with solutions for injection was found to be very rare, i.e. less than four ADRs per million ampoules. Com-pared to other countries worldwide, anthroposophic and homeopathic solutions for injection are most frequently prescribed in Germany. 5The sales of ampoules in Germany was shown to decrease in the time-frame as analysed.

Copyright \u00a9 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety (2012) DOI: 10.1002/pdsof these products (re-registration of marketing author- isation in Germany), companies withdrew a number of these products from the market. They were not ableto make the huge investment required (time and money-wise) to maintain marketing authorisation. With the participating anthroposophic and homeo-pathic manufactures, almost full coverage of the German market was reached. Thus, the present nd- ings are expected to be highly representative for thesafety status of anthroposophic and homeopathic medications in general. Most ADRs were reported in adults aged 19 to 64 years, whereas few ADRs were reported in chil- dren. The low number of ADR reports in children could be explained by the current German regulationfor authorisation of parenteral dosage forms. Those parenteral dosage forms with a therapeutic indication are often not indicated for children under the age of12 years because the speci c indication does not apply to children. Furthermore, physicians usually do not prefer solutions for injection in children. In 9.5% of all case reports, ADRS were classi ed as serious. Compared to non-serious ADRS, they seemed to occur signi cantly more frequent in males, in adults of 65 years and older, with complex products and pro- ducts with dilutions <1:10.000. The higher frequencyof serious ADRs in men and in patients of 65 years and older does not seem to be speci cally related to homeopathic and anthroposophic medicinal productssince a correlation between increasing age and higher ADR reporting rates is generally known. 15It has also been described that men may have a poorer healthstatus than women in a number of physical symptoms and conditions. 16Thending that 9.5% of all case reports were serious seems relatively high, but has tobe interpreted with caution. First, a broad de nition of ADRs was applied in this analysis. All ADRs for which regulatory reporting was required wereextracted. This included ADRs where causality assess- ment to injection of the medication was unlikely or unknown. Almost half of the case reports on seriousADRs (48%) were assessed as unlikely related to the medicinal product and could have been caused by the severity of the on-going disease and/or co-morbidityof patients. Other studies on anthroposophic and homeopathic medications did not report of any serious ADRs. 9-11,17One explanation might be the under- reporting of non-serious and listed ADRs in the pres- ent study. Most package lea flets of anthroposophic and homeopathic medications state that adverse reactions that are not listed in the lea flet should be reported to a physician or a pharmacist. This may leadTable 3.

Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety (2012) DOI: 10.1002/pdsto under-reporting of listed non-serious adverse reactions. Nevertheless, the reporting rate of serious ADRs as observed with injections in the present anal-ysis was rare (0.15 per million ampoules). In compar- ison, a recent review on the bene ts and safety of corticosteroid injections in the management of kneeosteoarthritis reported on severe infectious complica- tions upon injection as high as 1 in 3000 injections. 18 The reporting rates of ADRs associated with anthropo- sophic and homeopathic solutions for injection appeared to be more comparable to those of intra- articular saline and hyaluronic acid injection in thetreatment of osteoarthritis. 19,20 The ADRs that were identi ed were mostly related to skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and orgeneral disorders and administration site conditions. About one quarter of ADRs was related to the injec- tion procedure itself. With respect to the relative safetyof the frequently applied parenteral dosage forms, most serious ADRs were reported with intramuscular injections. No conclusions could be drawn about theoverall safety of the different parenteral dosage forms since it was not possible to calculate sales data per administration dosage form. Our present study suffered from some unavoidable limitations. The rst one was that of under-reporting of ADRs to the manufacturers. Practitioners and otherhealthcare providers may not always report on expected or unexpected ADRs. However, our ndings were in line with data from a study by Hamre et al. 17 in which adverse effects were monitored intensively. In this study, an incidence rate of one ADR per 382 patient-months of anthroposophic medications use(all dosage forms) was observed. With a daily dose of 0.7, a calculated ADR incidence rate in the Hamre study would be classi ed as very rare ( <0.01%) as well. Furthermore, comparable results were reported in a European survey among anthroposophic and homeopathic practitioners. 7The majority of practitioners (87%) had never or very rarely (1 or <1:10.000 treated patients) observed an ADR with anthroposophic or homeopathic solutions for injection, whereas 2.6%had rarely observed any ADR and 1.7% occasionally (8.9% gave no response). A second major limitation of the present study was that data analysis wasp e r f o r m e do nr e p o r t i n gr a t e s ,r a t h e rt h a ni n c i d e n c er a t e s of ADRs. Incidence rates of ADRs could not be calcu- lated since no information was available on how manyampoules for injection were used by patients in total, or in subgroups of patients. Reporting rates were cal- culated on the basis of the number of ampoules sold. However, ampoules sold are not necessarily prescribed a n du s e db yp a t i e n t s .C a s er e p o r t sf o rw h i c hi tw a sclear that the solutions for injection were administered orally, were excluded from data analysis. However, due to off-label use, sales data may have representedpatients that took ampoules orally rather than paren- teral. Based on practitioner 's prescription behav- iour, 7,17the oral use of ampoules is not expected to be high; nevertheless, it cannot be excluded. A major general limitation of pharmacovigilance data is that they highly depend on the quality of the reportingand monitoring system. During the last three years in Germany, as well as in other European countries, phar- macovigilance procedures have been considerablyimproved. The introduction of Volume 9a guidelines for pharmacovigilance which came into force in 2008 has attributed to this improvement. In the presentstudy, it became apparent that the collection and spon- taneous reporting of ADRs had signi cantly increased during the last 3 years when compared to the previousyears. Improved pharmacovigilance procedures may have contributed to this increase. Repetition of this evaluation of pharmacovigilance data within a timeframe of 5 years is therefore warranted. High-quality prospective observational studies are also necessary to further substantiate the safety pro le of homeo- pathic and anthroposophic solutions for injection. Such studies on safety have been described for ayurve- dic and homeopathic medicine in India. 21,22The recently described EvaMed Pharmacovigilance network, may provide such information for anthropo- sophic and homeopathic products.23 CONCLUSIONS This is the rst study that provided a systematic eval- uation of the safety of anthroposophic and homeo- pathic solution for injection from pharmacovigilancedatabases. Our results suggested that these solutions for injection have a low-risk pro le. This included complex products and those that were not highlydiluted. These results may provide reliable data for risk-benet ratio calculations of anthroposophic and homeopathic parenteral dosage forms.
