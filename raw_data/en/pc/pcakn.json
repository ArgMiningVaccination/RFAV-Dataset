Let's start at arriving at Verona airport in Italy. The bags arrived promptly within 20 minutes of landing. As I walk through to the arrivals lounge, my driver from the hotel is there waiting for me and I am driven from the airport to Lefay Resort & Spa in complete comfort and luxury - this sets the tone for the whole trip from now until I come back to this airport in... - Paul's Review of Lefay Resort & Spa, Lake Garda I wasn't sure what to expect from Lefay, all our client reviews were glowing but I couldn't quite envisage the Italian wellness scene; how would the indulgences of Italy translate into a healthy holiday? Needless to say, I was blown away! Lefay itself is stunningly located on the mountainside of Lake Garda in Northern Italy, set in beautiful woods and olives groves with breath-taking views... Guest Reviews - SamVisited July 2019 I had a wonderful time at Lefay, everything was planned perfectly by Health and Fitness Travel. It exceeded my expectations! It was amazing to be able to relax and exercise in a beautiful environment, close to the lake and in nature. High-quality room and facilities. - StuartVisited August 2018 Lefay is truly a high-class resort, with facilities, staff and food & drink to match. It was excellent for my fitness goals, with highly trained staff. I don't recall seeing so many good professionals in one same place ever before. It was a little over my initial budget, but I really made the right choice. For anyone looking to book, I would say that this is a world class resort, with incredible service and a very professional approach, so embrace all the treatments and all the health advice you will receive. I'll take my wife with me next year, and will contact Health and Fitness Travel again, as I received great complimentary treatments! Highs - Setting your first foot in the resort will reveal stunning mountain vistas and all your previous stress will be dropped at the entrance. - The Lefay Vital Gourmet concept lets you choose between a light and healthy spa menu and fine dishes and wines, so no one has to miss out on the culinary highlights Italy prides itself with. - All the spacious suites are spotlessly clean, exuding simple elegance and facilitating panoramic views from the private balcony or terrace. - Their wellness approach uses the knowledge and techniques of ancient Chinese medicine in the form of life-enriching consultations and rich spa treatments. - The spa is a serene oasis that features various places to unwind and relax; from the sauna and swimming pools to the underground salt bath for a unique spiritual experience. - With the calm, peaceful and elegant, minimalistic designs, its discrete charm makes Lefay a wellness resort like no other. - If admiring Gargano from the infinity pool and gym is just not enough, hop onto the shuttle bus that takes you downhill to this lakeside town. - The staff are exceptional; you will be welcomed and provided with a wholeheartedly environment and the therapists in the spa always give their everything. Lows - The hillside road leading to the resort is quite steep and twisty, but once you arrive at Lefay all the struggles of the journey will be forgotten. - Even though children of every age are welcomed and well looked after, a friendly staff member might kindly ask you and your kids to lower your voice to preserve the relaxing, undisturbed atmosphere. - This is not just a place for health-conscious travellers, hence it also accommodates guests who wish to have a bit more Italian indulgence in the form of gourmet food, alcohol and the one or another cigarette. - Think twice if it's worth leaving the comfortable resort for a tedious stroll through the touristic city of Gargano. - Avoid the peak season in the hot summer months that tend to make the pool feel quite crowded and could hinder you from de-stressing and switching-off properly.
