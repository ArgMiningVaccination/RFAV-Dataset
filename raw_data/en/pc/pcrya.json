Check out 11 easy, healthy freezer meals for new moms \u2014 many can be made in a Crock-Pot or Instant Pot.", "sitename": "WhattoExpect", "date": "2021-10-12", "cleaned_text": "You spend nine long months prepping for baby, and while much of that time is spent debating names and setting up the nursery, the rest is all about you \u2014 from regular prenatal appointments to closely monitoring your diet. Then you give birth, and your daily focus becomes one thing and one thing only: your new baby. Suddenly, you're staying on top of elaborate poop and feeding schedules but can't remember the last time you ate a proper meal. As for going to the grocery store and actually making dinner... just the thought of it is honestly exhausting. Enter make-ahead freezer meals, the saving grace of new moms everywhere. Why you might want to prep freezer meals Freezer meals are a simple yet genius way to make things easier on yourself once baby comes \u2014 so long as you remember to prepare and store them in the weeks leading up to your due date (when you actually still have time!). Think of freezer meals as a little insurance for your future mom self \u2014 she'll be oh-so-appreciative when she's getting zero sleep and trapped under an infant 24/7. According to prenatal nutritionist Ryann Kipping, R.D.N., it can be all too easy for new moms to forget to take care of themselves once their little one arrives, but doing so couldn't be more important. \"If you are breastfeeding, even some, you are still supplying nutrition to your baby,\" Kipping says. \"So, what you eat is just as important during this time as it was during pregnancy.\" Giving birth, she adds, has even been compared to running a marathon. That's why it's so important to replenish your nutrient stores \u2014 not just from the physical stress of delivering baby, but also from those nine months of pregnancy. Ingredients to include in postpartum freezer meals Above all else, Kipping says new moms should make sure they're getting enough calories per day and hydrating, especially if they are breastfeeding. (\"These are two major factors in being able to [produce enough breast milk](//www.whattoexpect.com/poor-milk-supply-breastfeeding.aspx) and keep mom energized to breastfeed and take care of the baby,\" she explains.) When it comes to specific vitamins and nutrients, Kipping says B vitamins, as well as vitamins A, D and K, choline and the omega-3 fatty acid DHA are vital. \"High-iron foods such as beef, pork and chicken are great choices,\" she adds, \"as well as warm vegetable soups, eggs, broth and fish.\" These ingredients can all be incorporated into ready-made freezer meals that you can then throw in the microwave or oven and cook within minutes. Not only do these dishes tend to be healthier than getting takeout, but they're cheaper. (So it's a win-win!)
