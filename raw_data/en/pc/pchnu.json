This ancient therapy uses the art and science of naturally extracted aromatic essences from plants to promote wellness of the body, mind and spirit. Here is how it works. When inhaled, the aromatic molecules enter your nasal passages where they stimulate the olfactory receptor sites in your nose, and they trigger nerve messages to the brain. Depending on what fragrance you are using, a different message is sent to your brain. Depending on the pure essential oil selected, aromatherapy has been shown to induce relaxation, provide stress relief, boost the immune and respiratory systems, increase energy, reduce stress and restore balance to mind, body and soul. An Aromatherapy diffusion system is included with MTI Air Baths on most Designer drop-in tub models. See individual product specification sheets for details. - Incorporated into the bath is a deck-mounted well that houses a fragrance canister. - Add a few drops of your favorite pure essential oil to a felt pad and place inside the canister. - When the air bath system is activated: - Warm air passes through the canister and blows the powerful scent of the aromatherapy oil into the air jets. - Then it is carried by millions of air bubbles through the water to the surface of the bath water, where the bubbles pop and release the aroma. - The scent fills the air, not the bath water.
