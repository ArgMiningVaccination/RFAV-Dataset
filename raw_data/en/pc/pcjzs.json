As patients with cancer exhibit a higher level of in flammation compared with the general patient population, patients with cancer and COVID-19 may uniquely bene t from strategies targeted at overcoming the unrestrained pro-in flammatory response. Targeted and non- targeted anti-in flammatory therapies may prevent end-organ damage in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer and decrease mortality. Here, we review the clinical role of selective inhibition of pro-in flammatory interleukins, non-targeted approaches includingcorticosteroids in their roles as disease-modulating agents in patients with COVID-19 and cancer. Investigation ofthese therapeutics in this highly vulnerable patient group is posited to facilitate the development of tailored therapeutics for this patient population, aiding the transition of systemic in flammation from a prognostic domain to a source of therapeutic targets.Key words: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, cancer, in flammation, immune modulation INTRODUCTION The pathophysiology of COVID-19, the pandemic disease resulting from infection by SARS-CoV-2, relies only in part on the direct cytopathic effect of the virus, with the host response proving central in determining end-organ dam-age. 1-3Accumulating evidence suggests that dysfunctional innate and adaptive immune responses contribute to dis-ease progression, as exempli ed by heightened levels of inflammatory markers in serum from severely ill patients. 1 Patients with cancer face worse prognosis from COVID-19 compared with the general patient population, with case fatality rates (CFRs) ranging between 17% and 33% inpatients with cancer, compared with 1%-5% of the general population with COVID-19.4-8 The presence of a pre-existing pro-in flammatory diathesis at time of SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the predispo-sition of patients with cancer to severe COVID-19 andincreased risk of death: mortality from COVID-19 has been,in fact, linked to pro-in flammatory cytokine excess leading to an unopposed immune response with detrimentalmultisystem effects. 1,2,9-13Oncologic disease and its asso- ciated treatments predispose patients with cancer to an intrinsic in flammatory state through neutrophilia resulting treatment- related immunode ciency. 14-17In a we demonstrated that a number of pro-in flammatory bio- markers including the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio nutritional index, modi ed Glasgow prognostic score, and prognostic index measured at time of SARS-CoV-2 infection identify patients with cancer at greater risk ofmortality from COVID-19. 18In particular, hypoalbuminemia, the reduction of expression of albumin that is part of anegative phase reaction largely driven by interleukin 6*Correspondence to: Dr Alessio Cortellini, Visiting Researcher, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, W12 0HS Clinical Senior Lecturer and Consultant Medical Oncologist, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London,Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, W12 0HS 2059-7029/\u00a9 2021 The Author(s).

TARGETED THERAPIES IL-6 Both advanced cancer and severe COVID-19 are character- ized by systemic excess of IL-6, a pro-in predominantly by and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs and PAMPs) and capable of stimulating acute phase protein synthesis, regulating neutrophil recruitment, and inducing repression of regula-tory T cells. 1,10,36-38In patients with cancer, increased IL-6 levels are linked to poorer prognosis via increased angio-genesis in solid tumors through up-regulation of vascularendothelial growth factor; tumor proliferation throughenhanced transcription activator oftranscription 3 (STAT3), an oncogenic transcription factor; and immune dysfunction through modulation of T cell ac- tivity. 39-42Heightened concentration of IL-6 has also has been linked to increased mortality in patients with severeCOVID-19 and consequently proposed as a therapeutictarget. 1,43-45IL-6 receptor antagonists may offer a thera- peutic advantage in patients with cancer and COVID-19 overthe unselected patient population through prevention of IL-6-mediated synergistic in flammation, especially considering the use of IL-6 receptor antagonists against another patho- physiologic similarity between COVID-19 and cancer:CRS. 9,46-49CRS is an acute in flammatory crisis resulting from an increase in circulating cytokines not only associated withsevere COVID-19, but also with bispeci c monoclonal anti- bodies and adoptive cell therapies including chimericantigen receptor T-cell therapies. 46,47,49,50Accordingly, treatment with tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor inhibitor traditionally utilized for rheumatoid arthritis, has been pro- posed as a therapy for severe COVID-19 in view of its utilityin treating CRS. 51-55Initially, retrospective and prospective analyses of the administration of tocilizumab to patientswith COVID-19-associated pneumonia admitted to hospitalrevealed that receipt of tocilizumab signi cantly reduces mortality. 51,53Disappointingly, the phase III COVACTA trial of tocilizumab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19- associated pneumonia showed no reduction in 28-day mortality despite evidence of improvement in duration ofhospital admission. 54,56Inclusion criteria may explain differing outcomes, such as the heterogeneity in the pre-sentation of severe COVID-19. 54In the more recent phase III EMPACTA trial of tocilizumab plus standard of care anti-COVID-19 therapy versus placebo in patients hospitalizedwith severe COVID-19-associated pneumonia, treatment with tocilizumab led to a 44% reduction in the risk of pro- gression to mechanical ventilation or death by day 28;although, overall mortality by day 28 did not signi cantly differ between patients 52Clinical bene tf r m tocilizumab was restricted to patients not requiring me-chanical ventilation, suggesting IL-6 blockade to be aneffective treatment only at certain stages of COVID-19 severity. 52 Sarilumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist utilized for rheu- matoid arthritis, demonstrates similarly mixed ef cacy against COVID-19 and failure to meet primary end-points. 57,58In an open-label study of sarilumab against se- vere COVID-19, patients receiving sarilumab demonstratedno differences in clinical improvement (61% sarilumabversus 64% standard of care, P\u00bc0.94) or mortality (7%ESMO Open G.

Evolving clinical experience suggests the need for more precise strati cation of severity in hospitalized COVID-19 Figure 1.

The predictive role of baseline pro-in flammatory status warrants further investigation, given the ef cacy of sar- ilumab only in patients with lower circulating baseline IL-6. 58Identi cation of predictive biomarkers of response to these expensive therapies may aid a more judicious clinicaluse, especially given the heterogeneity emerging fromclinical trials and the lack of in fluence over mortality seen in unselected hospitalized patients with COVID-19. 10,52,54,56-58 Importantly, IL-6 blockade may fail to ameliorate severe disease due to interference with the compensatory anti- inflammatory response, a reaction to in flammation that involves increased production of anti-in flammatory cyto- kines, primarily IL-10, and consequent restoration of ho-meostasis. 59IL-6 blockade may complicate the mounting of the compensatory anti-in flammatory response and subse- quent resolution of the in flammatory state.59Duration and timing of the anti-in flammatory response are linked to outcomes in patients with infectious diseases.59 Importantly, interleukin signaling is redundant and pleiotropic; therefore, inhibition of a single pathway maynot result in clinical bene t. 60While studies have included patients with concomitant cancer and COVID-19 beingtreated with tocilizumab in their cohorts, the outcomes ofthese patients have not been independently analyzed. 8 Whether cancer patients may represent a population exquisitely sensitive to IL-6 inhibition remains to be ascertained. Bruton 's tyrosine kinase A relatively unexplored avenue of therapy for COVID-19 may be a drug class commonly utilized in the treatmentof certain of B-cell malignanciesincluding lymphomas and leukemias. 61,62BTK inhibitors are currently utilized in treatment regimens for some B-cellmalignancies including mantle (CLL). 63,64The BTK inhibitor ibrutinib has been proposed as a novel therapeutic for COVID-19, and the second generation BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib has exhibited ef cacy against COVID-19 in a small cohort of severely ill patients receiving oxygen when administered asa salvage therapy. 65,66Traditionally utilized as a BTK inhib- itor in CLL, cell kinase (HCK), a kinase involved in immune cellrecruitment within the lung by alveolar type II cells. 65 Attenuation of immune cell recruitment by these alveolar cells via ibrutinib-mediated HCK inhibition may reduce pulmonary in flammation in patients with severe COVID- 19.65,67In a cohort of six patients with concomitant Wal- denstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia (WM), a non-Hodgkin B-celllymphoma, and COVID-19 already receiving ibrutinib forWM at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, patients receivingthe recommended 420 mg/day dosage of ibrutinib for WMdid not require hospitalization or develop COVID-19-induced dyspnea, while the patient receiving the 140 mg/ day dosage of ibrutinib demonstrated rapid clinical deteri- oration and required mechanical ventilation, but quickly recovered following increase of ibrutinib to 420 mg/day. 65,68Exploration of the ef cacy of ibrutinib in the treatment of COVID-19 will elucidate the therapeutic effectsof acalabrutinib administration observed in severely ill pa-tients with COVID-19. 66Acalabrutinib does not exhibit binding with HCK and is highly speci c for BTK; therefore, acalabrutinib may improve clinical status in a non-HCK- dependent manner.69Exploration of these avenues will also provide further insight into the interplay between thevirus-mediated cytopathic and immune system-mediatedinflammatory effects of COVID-19 given the status of alve- olar cells as both entry points for SARS-CoV-2, due to theirsurface expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), the receptor exploited by SARS-CoV-2, and media-tors of pulmonary in flammation. 65 Study of ibrutinib or acalabrutinib treatment in patients with cancer and COVID-19, with an emphasis on patientswith thoracic malignancies possessing heightened baselinepulmonary in flammation before SARS-CoV-2 infection, is necessary to understand if clinical improvement throughattenuation of local pulmonary in flammation via ibrutinib or if clinical improvement through a separate mechanism viaacalabrutinib improves outcomes from COVID-19 and is a viable targeted COVID-19 therapy by primary tumor type. 65,66,70Currently, the Academic and Community Cancer Research United is preparing to recruit >130 patients with concomitant B-cell malignancy and COVID-19 to a pro-spective study exploring ibrutinib peutic class utilized in a range of autoimmune andinflammatory diseases. 71JAK activation is critical for transcription of cytokines via downstream activation ofSTATs; necessary for cell dif ferentiation and hematopoie- sis; and has been linked in its constitutively activatedforms to leukemia development via cancer cell inhibitors attenuate in through reduction of cytokine andinflammatory element transcription and are being explored as therapeutics for leukemias due to inhibition ofleukemic cell proliferation an d reduction of the neoplasm- induced in flammatory state. 73,74JAK inhibitors accordingly may serve as an anti-COVID-19 therapeutic throughreduction of circulating cytokines and additionally confer preferential bene t for patients with concomitant COVID- 19 and hematologic malignancies associated with aberrantJAK signaling. 72,74The JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, which exhibits antileukemic activity, has been studied for itsimmunosuppressive effects in severe COVID-19. 75-77 Administration of ruxolitinib did not improve outcomesfrom COVID-19 in severely ill patients but was associatedwith faster clinical improvement and improved chestESMO Open G.

Another phase III clinical study is recruiting hospitalizedpatients with severe COVID- 19 with or without cancer to receive pacritinib, an oral JAK2 and fms-like tyrosine Identi er: NCT04404361). 81 Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a pro-in flammatory cytokine family up-regulated in autoimmune disorders, infectiousdiseases, and cancer, regulates the expression of reactiveoxygen species and other pro-in flammatory cytokines through the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells and activator protein 1 pathways. 82TNF family cytokines are primarily secreted by macrophages, butalso produced in smaller quantities by lymphocytes. 82 Higher baseline circulating TNF cytokines have been linkedto cachexia, sepsis, and poorer 82In TNF protumoral effects.83TNF has demonstrated inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth in solid tumor models.83Conversely, TNF has been identi- ed as skin, hepatic, and gastrointes- tinal carcinogenesis.83Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit higher circulating TNF, and higher baseline TNF isassociated with poorer outcomes from COVID-19. 1,84 Accordingly, anti-TNF therapy has been proposed to counter COVID-19 hyperin flammation.84Anti-TNF thera- peutics have been hypothesized to have broader anti- inflammatory effects than IL-6 receptor antagonists, as TNF blockade broadly reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and clotting biomarkers, effects not observed from IL-6 blockade. 85TNF also facilitates SARS-CoV entry through ACE2 and extend similarassistance to SARS-CoV-2. 86,87Large, randomized trials are lacking: case and small cohort reports comprise the currentbody of evidence for anti-TNF as a COVID-19 therapeutic. 87-89A case report revealed that a patient receiving the TNF- a inhibitor etanercept and the antimetabolite methotrexate for spondyloarthritis, who later developed COVID-19, did not require intensive care, and did not develop respiratorydistress or lymphopenia. 88A survey distributed in Lombardy, Italy, to 320 patients receiving immune-modulating thera-peutics for chronic arthritis, with 52% of patients receivingTNF inhibitors, identi ed four patients with con rmed COVID-19, four patients with symptoms highly suggestive ofCOVID-19, and ve patients with contact with a known COVID-19 case. 89From this group, only one patient required hospital admission for COVID-19 and subsequently recov-ered; importantly, this study can only serve as anecdotalevidence of the association between immune-modulatingtherapeutics and COVID-19 risk. 89In Pavia, Italy, three pa- tients receiving anti-TNF therapy for dis-eases who contracted COVID-19 did not develop dyspnea orrequire hospitalization. 87No data exists for patients with cancer and COVID-19 receiving anti-TNF therapy as a COVID- 19 therapeutic. Patients with rheumatological diseases havecomprised the current focus of anti-TNF therapy and impli-cations for COVID-19 disease course due to concernsregarding this immunosuppressive treatment and COVID-19risk. 87Patients with cancer and COVID-19 warrant study, as TNF imbalance supports tumor initiation, invasion, andmetastasis and is a noted serological marker of severe COVID-19. 90Anti-TNF treatment may extend preferential bene t to patients with cancer and COVID-19 who possess heightened baseline TNF, but anti-TNF therapy may alsocomplicate oncologic short-term anti-TNF treatment not been associated with cancerprogression, the effects of anti-TNF therapies in patients withcancer and infectious disease remain to be tested. 84As e a r c h onClinicalTrials.gov revealed no clinical trials currently investigating anti-TNF treatment speci cally for patients with cancer and COVID-19. NON-TARGETED THERAPIES Corticosteroids Corticosteroids are glucocorticoid hormones utilized for their broad anti-in flammatory and lymphocytolytic effects in a variety of diseases including asthma, leukemias, andrheumatoid arthritis. 91-93Corticosteroids penetrate the cellular thusallowing glucocorticoid receptor and flammatory mediators via interaction with glucocorticoid response ele-ments and interference with transcription. 92,94In patients with leukemia, steroids alter oncogene expression and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.92Current treatment protocols for COVID-19 include corticosteroids such asdexamethasone, but knowledge gaps persist regarding thetiming and duration of steroid therapies for COVID-19. 95 The RECOVERY trial demonstrated that dexamethasoneadministration resulted in reduced mortality among pa-tients with COVID-19 receiving oxygen therapy, includingG. M. Dettorre et al. ESMO Open Volume 6 -Issue 3 -2021 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2021.100123 5those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and non- invasive methods of oxygenation.96Patients who did not require respiratory support exhibited no bene t from dexamethasone receipt.96Dexamethasone has also been associated with decreased mortality in patients with severeCOVID-19 in a prospective meta-analysis by the WorldHealth Organization (WHO). 96,97Taken together, these re- sults provide support for dexamethasone as a treatment ofsevere COVID-19, but not for mild cases. Patients with cancer and severe COVID-19 may bene t from corticosteroid therapy through prevention of syner- gistic in flammation. Interestingly, the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) has shown that administration of high-dose corticosteroids is not associated with mortality bene t in patients with COVID-19 and cancer, but administration ofhigh-dose corticosteroids in combination with any otheranti-COVID-19 therapeutic is associated with increasedmortality. 98It is important to note that the exact role of corticosteroids in patients with cancer and COVID-19 is difcult to establish, as corticosteroids are often adminis- tered for symptom palliation; therefore, this therapeuticmay demonstrate increased mortality only when utilizedin combination with another COVID-19 therapeutic asobserved by the CCC19, due to worse baseline clinicalconditions of patients rather than a disease-worseningeffect of corticosteroid treatment. 98,99Further, steroid- induced immune suppression may be compounded by the concomitant receipt of anticancer treatments that suppressthe immune system including chemotherapy. 100,101Addi- tionally, patients included in the CCC19 study were notnecessarily severely ill from COVID-19, while patients in theRECOVERY trial and WHO meta-analysis were severely ill,making the role of corticosteroids harder to elucidate. 96-98 Bene t of corticosteroid therapy may be limited to severely ill patients or patients receiving oxygen therapy. For patients with cancer and severe COVID-19 requiringoxygen therapy, corticosteroid therapy may prevent syner-gistic in flammation and provide an opportunity to identify inflammatory biomarkers predictive of steroid bene t. Corticosteroid therapy may also preferentially bene tp a - tients with leukemia and COVID-19, especially patients withchildhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as steroids may exhibit dual anti-COVID-19 and anti-neoplastic action. 92 Importantly, treatment providers must consider potentially compounded immune suppression resulting from concom-itant receipt of steroidal and anticancer therapeutics inpatients with cancer and COVID-19. 100-102Further study will reveal differences in immune system response betweenpatients with cancer and the general patient population. Antimalarials Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, widely used antima- larial agents, were explored as therapeutics for COVID-19due to their potential for blockage of viral via inter-ference with pH-dependent endosomes and attenuation ofsystemic cytokine release by of the antimalarialagents with antigen processing and autoantigenpresentation. 103,104The RECOVERY trial revealed a lack of support for hydroxychloroquine as an anti-COVID-19 ther- apeutic.105Hydroxychloroquine non-signi cant increased mortality; reduced likelihood of being discharged alive fromthe hospital within 28 days; increased incidence of me-chanical ventilation; and increased occurrence of cardiacdeaths but not cardiac arrhythmias. 105Hydroxychloroquine administration also raised concerns regarding potential forcardiotoxicity; accordingly, the RECOVERY trial excluded patients with prolonged QTc intervals from the hydroxy- chloroquine arm. 105In contrast, OnCovid demonstrated reduced mortality rates among patients with concomitantcancer and COVID-19 exposed to antimalarials comparedwith patients receiving no anti-COVID-19 therapy; although,estimation of a precise effect of antimalarials over other co-administered therapies cannot be fully appreciated due tothe retrospective design. 4These results differ from those of the CCC19 study.4,98In the CCC19 cohort, patients with cancer and COVID-19 receiving hydroxychloroquine werecharacterized by higher mortality compared with untreatedcontrols and patients receiving any other anti-COVID-19therapeutics. 98A clinical trial hosted by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center is recruiting patients with cancerreceiving radiotherapy to study the potential of hydroxy-chloroquine ( ClinicalTrials. gov USC is recruiting patients study baricitinib alone or in combination with anti-COVID-19 therapeutics, including hydroxychloroquine, to treatmoderate and severe COVID-19 in patients with cancer(ClinicalTrials.gov identi er: NCT04373044). Further studies will clarify the role of hydroxychloroquine as an anti-COVID-19 therapeutic, but serious safety concerns, including po-tential cardiotoxicity, may be heightened in patients with cancer who are predisposed to prolonged QTc due to anticancer therapeutics. 105-108The practice of routinely prescribing antimalarials for COVID-19 has largely fallen outof favor following publication of the results of RECOVERY ,which showed no bene t from the utilization of these therapies in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 105 Colchicine Colchicine, an anti-gout agent with broad anti- inflammatory effects, has been proposed a putative therapeutic pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) in flammasome, a component of innate immunity that regulates secretion and ofstimulators colchicine treatment exhibited association with better survivalcompared with standard of care in patients hospitalizedwith COVID-19-associated pneumonia. 114Furthermore,ESMO Open G.

A search on ClinicalTrials. gov revealed no clinical trials currently investigating colchicine treatment speci cally for patients with cancer and COVID-19. Thymosin alpha 1 Thymosin alpha 1 (T a1), a peptide produced by and isolated from thymic tissue, may ameliorate immunederangement induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. 122-124Ta1, the active cleavage product of prothymosin alpha, acts broadly in normal physiology to stimulate T-cell matura-tion, antigen presentation, natural killer (NK) cell activity,and infected dendritic cell activity. 125Ta1 exerts this broad immune system modulation via interaction withintracellular Toll-like receptors, a protein class responsiblefor identifying PAMPs in in myeloid andplasmacytoid dendritic cells. 126,127Administration of syn- thetic T a1 has exhibited restoration of immune system homeostasis through lymphoid cell activation in ex vivo human immunode ciency virus-1 samples and through NK cell activation in mouse models of leukemia.125,128In patients with severe COVID-19, T a1 treatment demon- strated association with reduced mortality, improved T-cell counts, and reversal of T-cell exhaustion. 124Ex vivo Ta1 treatment of blood cells from patients with COVID- 19 con rmed T a1 prevents cytokine storms and reduces T-cell exhaustion in COVID-19.123The condition of cyto- kine excess that accompanies cancer progression andleads to exhausted, or hyporesponsive, T cells is a well-known determinant of prognosis in patients withadvanced malignancies. 35,129,130It can therefore be hy- pothesized that patients with cancer and COVID-19 maypreferentially bene t from T a1 treatment over the gen- eral patient population through reduction of synergistic T- cell exhaustion from both cancer and COVID-19. Thephase II PROTHYMOS study is currently investigating T a1 as prophylaxis for patients with cancer and severe COVID-19.131Conclusion of this study and comparative investi- gation between patients with COVID-19, with or without history of cancer, will help clarify whether a role exists for this therapy in patients with COVID-19 and cancer. Immune checkpoint inhibitors A number of cancers are characterized by a lack of anti- tumor T-cell reactivity.132Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) are immune checkpoint receptors on T cells that preventuncontrolled immune responses in normal physiologythrough binding with their respective ligands B7 and pro- grammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), sentation and consequent T-cell response. 132In oncologic disease, these regulators prevent antitumor activity andcancer cell elimination by T cells as some cancer cells ex-press surface B7 and PD-L1. 132First utilized binding. 133As severe COVID-19 may cause T-cell exhaustion, ICIs have been postulated to restore T-cell function in critically illpatients; however, only observational registries of patientswith COVID-19 and cancer undergoing ICI treatment ofoncologic disease exist, and no studies for the general pa-tient population with COVID-19 exist. 134,135Although ICIs may exhibit anti-COVID-19 action through reversal of T-cellexhaustion, complications of ICI treatment, including ICI- pneumonitis, raise concern over safety of ICI treatment and necessitate studies balancing the reversal of T-cellexhaustion with the risk of pneumonitis. 134,136The Thoracic Cancers International COVID-19 Collaboration (TERAVOLT)registry demonstrated that patients with cancer receivingICI therapy either alone or in combination with chemo-therapy for oncologic disease at the time of COVID-19diagnosis did not exhibit higher mortality rates. 135A multicenter observational study of patients from hospitals in North America, Europe, and Australia revealed that pa-tients with COVID-19 already receiving ICIs for cancer didnot present higher mortality than patients with cancer andCOVID-19 not receiving ICIs at time of COVID-19 diag-nosis. 137In a study of patients undergoing PD-1 blockade for lung cancer and later diagnosed with COVID-19, PD-1blockade receipt did not affect mortality and did not alter circulating IL-6. 138While PD-1 blockade may reduce viral load through restoration of effector function, this thera-peutic may not reduce systemic in flammation. 138While ongoing ICI therapy for cancer does not appear to increasesusceptibility to fatal COVID-19, there are no studies of ICIsadministered as anti-COVID-19 therapeutics. Study of ICItreatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cancerand COVID-19 not previously receiving this antineoplastic therapy will clarify the safety and utility of ICIs for reversal of T-cell exhaustion in infectious disease.

Detailed im- mune pro ling by Hamad Medical Corporation of patients with cancer and COVID-19, including pro ling of circulating ICI levels and subsequent COVID-19 outcomes, will clarify patient responses at the molecular level ( ClinicalTrials.gov identi er: NCT04473131). CONCLUSIONS Accumulating evidence suggests that patients with cancer and COVID-19 may uniquely bene t from therapeutics that attenuate systemic in flammation and consequently prevent synergistic in flammation. The heightened susceptibility of patients with cancer to fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection mayresult from higher baseline in flammation due to oncological disease subsequently aggravated by infectious disease;however, further study is required to determine the con-tributions of cancer histology, state, and treatment toinflammation and outcomes from COVID-19. In this review, we described how therapeutic targeting of pathways implicated in the systemic in flammatory response may preferentially bene t patients with cancer over the general patient population. Despite displaying higher CFRs, patientswith cancer have not been the focus of speci c studies of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics, perhaps due to the concernsover the confounding effect of malignancy in determiningmortality. The majority of evidence guiding treatment of patients with COVID-19 and cancer has emerged from retrospective registries: none of these studies can substitute prospective,randomized, controlled studies in homogeneous patientpopulations. Certain areas are still characterized by a sig-nicant knowledge gap, and the comparison between pro- spective versus retrospective evidence emerges perhapsmore strongly in the case of corticosteroid therapy, atreatment for which there is a lack of bene t for patients with COVID-19 and cancer, but improved outcomes for the general patient population with COVID-19. 96-98 Such level of uncertainty calls for the need to elucidate the utility of anti-in flammatory agents in treating severe COVID-19 in patients with cancer in prospective clinicaltrials. 139The lack of molecular or immunologic strati cation is also a major limitation to most studies of COVID-19therapeutics. Ef cient determination of in flammatory marker levels via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay proling of patients with severe COVID-19 has been pro- posed for personalized COVID-19 therapeutic regimens. 140 Especially for patients with a heightened risk for synergis-tic in flammation, this would aid in rapid determination of the targeted or non-targeted therapy to be utilized. To thisend, the COVID-19 antiviral response in a pan-tumor im-mune monitoring study (CAPTURE), a prospective studyrecruiting patients with concomitant cancer and COVID-19, aims to pro le the immune responses of these patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection. 141Translational studies similar to CAPTURE will help establish the molecular features under-lying the progression of COVID-19 in patients with cancerand facilitate the development of targeted and non-targeted anti-in flammatory agents in patients who are most likely to derive clinical bene t. The challenge of the global COVID-19 pandemic has proven the utility of cross- eld collaboration for drug repurposing and treatment development. 136,142Immuno- oncologists, experienced with immune-modulating thera-peutics, have both identi ed anticancer drugs that may offer therapeutic bene t for COVID-19 and noted similar- ities between anticancer treatment and COVID-19, includingthose of ICI-induced pneumonitis and the ground-glassopacities of COVID-19 pneumonia. 136As COVID-19 vaccine distribution criteria vary across regions, improved treat- ments for patients with concomitant cancer and COVID-19 will continue to be an unmet need that may beaddressed through immunomodulatory drugs. 136,143-145 FUNDING This work was supported by grant funding from the Well- come Trust Strategic Fund [grant number PS3416] (to DJP)and acknowledges infrastructural support by the CancerResearch UK Imperial Centre and the Imperial NationalInstitute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre.
