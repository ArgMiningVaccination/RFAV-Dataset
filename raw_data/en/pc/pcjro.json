However, they are also expensive, so purchasing real fruits and veggies may be more cost-effective instead. Key Features - Contains freeze-dried, powderized fruits and vegetables - Third-party tested for nutrition content, pesticides and heavy metals, according to the company - No additives, extracts, added chemicals, synthetics or sugar Founded in 1997 by Douglas Howard, D.C., Balance of Nature is a health supplement company that offers fruit, vegetable and spice supplements. It touts a philosophy called the \"Triad of Health,\" composed of what it considered to be the physical, spiritual and chemical components of health. It's a belief that what one thinks, does and eats must all be in balance to maintain overall health. Balance of Nature supplements are third-party tested to validate nutritional content and to detect any potentially harmful materials, such as pesticides and heavy metals. The company also goes through an internal quality control to test its products for \"color, smell and taste,\" which it claims helps preserve phytonutrients. Following a consumer protection lawsuit filed by prosecutors in the California Food, Drug and Medical Device Task Force in July 2023, Balance of Nature agreed to pay a settlement of $1.1 million for false advertising claims made surrounding its dietary supplements. These funds will be used to cover costs associated with the investigation, civil penalties and customer restitution. |Pros||Cons| | | Balance of Nature Fruits and Veggies at a Glance - Ingredients: Freeze-dried whole fruits and vegetables with specific blends designed to increase nutrition - Cost: A monthly supply costs $89.95 for a one-time purchase or $69.95 when opting into the subscription service - Safety: Third-party tested for potentially harmful substances, like pesticides, according to the company How Does Balance of Nature Fruits and Veggies Work? Balance of Nature Fruits and Veggies contain real fruits and vegetables, offered in three proprietary blends. The produce is dehydrated via freeze-drying, then ground into a fine powder and inserted into vegetable capsules. The Fruit capsules contain 16 whole fruits including aloe vera (leaf), apple, strawberry, pineapple, blueberry, cherry (tart and sweet) and more. The Vegetable capsules contain 15 vegetables, such as broccoli, wheatgrass, kale and cauliflower. The company recommends taking three capsules of each supplement per day (for a total of six capsules), which it claims provides a total variety of 31 fruits and vegetables. Each bottle of Fruits and Veggies contains 90 capsules, or a 30-day supply. The capsules can be swallowed with water, chewed or opened and poured into juices or atop dishes like salad or cottage cheese. Balance of Nature also offers a third supplement called Fiber and Spice, which contains a powdered blend of 12 different spices and fiber that can be taken twice per day in water or juice. This supplement can be taken alongside the Fruits & Veggies capsules to provide more sources of soluble and insoluble fiber. It contains ingredients not found in the other Balance of Nature supplements, including psyllium husk, flax seed and apples. The Cost of Balance of Nature Fruit and Veggies Supplements The Fruit and Veggies supplements can be purchased from Balance of Nature's website for $89.95. The website also offers subscription services through its \"Subscribe & Save\" option, for \"preferred customers,\" starting at a discounted cost of $69.95 per month. Becoming a preferred customer comes with an initial upfront fee of $24.95, but it also includes free shipping, automatic delivery every 28 days and complementary health coaching from the company. The Fine Print In the past, Balance of Nature has received warnings from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA.) In August of 2019, the FDA issued a warning letter to Balance of Nature, claiming that the company made unverified health claims and misbranded its supplements. The FDA found evidence that the dietary supplements were \"adulterated,\" meaning not compliant with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations and that the company had failed to implement quality control measures. Today, the health claims on Balance of Nature's website are quite vague, stating that \"changes are happening on a cellular level\" without elaborating on specifics. It also points to the potential benefits of plant-based diets, such as providing nutrients for optimal health and supporting brain function. However, the website's disclaimer currently states that the product isn't intended to treat or cure any diseases. The company also doesn't offer any information about the total vitamin or mineral content in the Fruits and Veggies supplements, which leaves the type and quantity of nutrients in each serving unclear. While Balance of Nature claims to third-party test its supplements, lab results aren't readily available on the website. Balance of Nature did not respond to Forbes Health's request for comment. What Experts Say About Balance of Nature At first glance, none of the ingredients in Balance of Nature's supplements are inherently poor, says Maddie Pasquillano, a registered dietitian based in Brooklyn, New York. However, she considers terms on the product's label, such as \"Maintain Blend\" and \"Protect Blend,\" to be of concern. \"Companies use this terminology so that they can avoid disclosing the actual percentage of each ingredient in the supplement,\" explains Pasquillano. \"Your body can only use so much of a certain nutrient at a given time, so by taking supplements whose amounts are so unpredictable and unregulated, you are very likely overloading your body with something it will just excrete while burning money in the process.\" Instead of turning to a supplement like Balance of Nature to fill in any \"nutritional gaps\" in one's diet, Pasquillano suggests eating more whole fruits and vegetables first. \"Most people can achieve a full balance of the nutrients they need much more easily, and more healthfully, by prioritizing real foods,\" she adds. Our Balance of Nature Experience I ordered the Fruits and Veggies supplements from Balance of Nature's website, which was a smooth process. Initially, I had trouble tracking my order through the provided tracking number, so I started a live chat with a customer service representative. They responded quickly and were able to help me solve the issue in under half an hour. My order arrived within five days, which was faster than I thought. I took the fruit and vegetable capsules either in the morning or early afternoon, depending on my schedule. The fruit capsules had a slightly sweet aftertaste, which I liked. On the other hand, the veggie capsules tasted earthy, which I wasn't a fan of. They are both a bit large but were easy to swallow with water. I didn't notice any effects while taking these supplements\u2014no extra stamina, for example, like one customer testimonial claimed. I generally try to eat plenty of whole fruits and vegetables every day. On days when I didn't have time to cook or eat enough fruits and vegetables, it was nice to have a \"backup\" with extra nutrition. However, I wish I knew exactly how many servings of fruits and veggies are in the capsules or the total percentages of nutrients. In my opinion, these supplements might be helpful for someone who doesn't have time to cook or has to follow a restrictive diet. That said, I personally wouldn't purchase Balance of Nature again. For $89.95, I would rather purchase more fresh fruits and vegetables and incorporate those into my diet. Even with the discounted subscription option, I still consider that too high of a cost to \"fill in the gaps,\" especially for a product that doesn't offer more specifics about its nutritional content.
