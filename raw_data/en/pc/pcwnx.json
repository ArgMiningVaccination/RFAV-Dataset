CSAT Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs) are prepared by the Quality Assurance and Evaluation Branch to facilitate the transfer of state-of-the-art protocols and guidelines for the treatment of alcohol and othe r drug (AOD) abuse from acknow- ledged clinical, research, and administrative experts to the Nati on's AOD abuse treatment resources. The dissemination of a TIP is the last step in a process that be gins with the recommendation of an AOD abuse problem area for consideration by a panel of experts. These experts include clinicians, researchers, and program managers, as well as professiona ls in such related fields as social services or criminal justice. Once a topic has been selected, CSAT creates a Federal Resource Panel, with members from pertinent Federal agencies and national organizati ons, to review the state of the art in treatment and program management in the area selecte d. Recommendations from this Federal Panel are then transmitted to the members of a second grou p, which consists of non-Federal experts who are intimately familiar with the topic. This group, known as a non-Federal Consensus Panel, meets for about 3 days, makes recommendations, de fines protocols, and a rrives at agreement on protocols. Its members represent AOD abuse treat ment programs, hospitals, community health centers, counseling programs, criminal justice and child welfare agencies, and private practitioners. A Chair for the Panel is charged w ith responsibility for ensuring that the resulting protocol reflects true group consensus. The next step is a review of the proposed guidelines and protocol by a third group whose members serve as expert field reviewers. Once their recommendations and responses have been reviewed, the Chair approves th e document for publication. The result is a TIP reflecting the actual state of the art of AOD a buse treatment in public and private programs recognized for their provision of high quality a nd innovative AOD abuse treatment. This TIP on guidelines for the treatment of pr egnant, substance-using women is the second published by CSAT since a treatment improvement initiative began. It represents another step by CSAT toward its goal of bringing national leadership to bear in the effort to improve AOD abuse treatment.

The child's birth may give her a powerful motive to seek treatment for her addiction. Early intervention e fforts during the prenatal period increase the likelihood that she will succe ssfully recover from alc ohol and other drug abuse. It is equally important to provide the pregnant, substanc e-using woman with optimal, comprehensive obstetrical care. The results of prenatal drug exposure are well documented and can include intrauterine growth retardation, pr ematurity and low birth weight, central nervous system damage, and congenital physical malformations, among others. A continuum of followup services is a third critical element for an improved quality of life for the substance-using woman and her family. She of ten lives in a stressful environment that may include physical and sexual abus e, single parenthood, and limited financial and social support. Interventions during the pos tnatal period are needed to help her successfully parent her child, abstain from the use of alcohol and other drugs, and address complex social needs. The Center for Substance Abusement Treatmen t (CSAT) is keenly aware that pregnant, substance-using women and their children suffer from the adverse effects of addiction and is dedicated to enhancing and mobilizing the health and human services that they need. With this commitment, CSAT sought the advice and directi on of a Federal Resource Panel. Based on their guidance, a national Consensus Panel of expert s was convened. The medi cal care, alcohol and other drug treatment, and legal and et hical guidelines presented in th is document are the result of their efforts. On behalf of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and CSAT, we wish to express our grateful appr eciation to the Consensus Panel Ch air, Dr. Janet Mitchell, and to the many dedicated individuals who participat ed in the development of this Treatment Improvement Protocol. These guidelines are intended to st imulate a wide variety of servi ce providers to participate in crafting a full continuum of fam ily-oriented services for pregna nt, substance-using women and their children. The guidance offered by these prot ocols is the result of research knowledge and the clinical experience, careful deliberation, and heartfelt concern of Panel members. We invite you to use and adapt these models of care to stre ngthen your delivery of serv ices to this at-risk population. Nelba Chavez, Ph.D. Administrator Substance Abuse and Mental He alth Services Administration David J. Mactas Director Center for Substance Abuse Treatment TIP 2: Introduction Despite decades of progress, individuals from all walks of life, in urban, suburban, and rural communities, continue to use and abuse legal and illegal drugs. This report focuses on the drug treatment, medical care, and fo llowup services needed by one special population -- pregnant, substance-using women. 1 Because this Treatment Improvement Protocol is particularly designed to assist drug treatment programs that receive Block Grant funding throu gh their State substanc e abuse agencies, the emphasis here is on women served in the publicly funded drug treatment system. Such women are often poor and suffering from multiple soci oeconomic problems. This emphasis should in no way obscure the fact that many affluent wome n also experience alcohol and drug problems. Those women who receive medical care through thei r private providers also need treatment for alcohol and other drug abuse. These guidelines are relevant to these women as well. Our knowledge has increased dramatically about th e dangers for the fetus of maternal use of alcohol and other drugs during pregnancy. These adverse eff ects are a source of mounting concern for many communities. Evidence continues to accumulate that children exposed to drugs in utero are at risk for long-term developmental problems.2 Environmental risk factors may interact with substance abuse to impact women and their families. For example, some women may suffer fro m poor nutrition and lack access to prenatal care. Women and their families may experience unstable home environments and homelessness.3 Frequently, pregnant, substance- using women have experienced se xual, physical, and emotional abuse that has gone unnoticed and untreate d. Many women are victims of poor parenting.4 The pregnant, substance-using women who are targeted by these guidelines are often familiar with publicly funded medical, le gal, and social service deliv ery systems. These women may receive welfare support, hosp ital emergency room care, pub licly supported housing, and food supplements. They may involuntarily surface through the court system. Other women may be prevented from seeking the help and care they need due to cultural pr ohibitions and earlier negative experiences. Some communities prosecute and jail women who abuse alcohol a nd other drugs while pregnant. These women may be legally separated from thei r children as well. More common, however, is the neglect they experience from health care and service delivery systems. The painful repercussions of the prosecuti on and neglect of pregnant, s ubstance-using women and their children can be seen in shelters for battered women, among homeless populations, and in foster homes and child welfare inst itutions across the country. Intervention for the Woman and Her Family Early intervention during the pren atal period is highly desirable for the health of the woman, the fetus, and her infant after birt h and for the initiation of alcohol and other drug treatment for the mother. The following guidelines emphasize a con tinuum of care, that is, long-term, perhaps indefinite, provision of services in support of the woman and her fam ily. The woman who is linked to appropriate resources can be effectively supported to recover and to manage her multiple roles. This concept reflects the comprehens ive approach to care that is needed and that is intended by these guidelines. Guidelines for Comprehensive Care The Center for Substance Abusement Treatment (C SAT) has sponsored the development of this Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) to prov ide guidance for those who care for pregnant, substance-using women and their families. The TIP development process was modeled on similar efforts undertaken by the Federal Govern ment to address complex health and social service delivery issues. The consensus model that was used to develop these guidelines drew on the experience and expertise of representa tive specialists from across the Nation. The process began with CSAT's appointment of a Federal Resource Panel of medical personnel, alcohol and other drug treatment e xperts, social service providers, and representatives of national organizations (for Federal Panel members, see Appendix G ). The subsequent Consensus Panel of experts worked together in teams to prepar e these treatment and service guidelines (for Consensus Panel members, see page vii). Th e draft guidelines were reviewed by over 35 additional field specialists (for field reviewers, see Appendix H ). The final recommendations of the Consensus Panel reflect the diversity of e xperience and, most importa ntly, the agreement of many of the Nation's foremost experts regarding the basic principles and guidelines for programs to use to provide supportive, comprehensive care needed by pregnant, su bstance-using women. Guidelines Focus on Patient Needs The Consensus Panel strongly supports the view that the use of alcohol and other drugs by women during pregnancy is a publ ic health issue, not a lega l problem. The guidelines are intended to offer direction for the many discipli nes involved in caregiving, including physicians, nurses, social workers, psychologi sts, counselors, and others. They are designed to be used in a variety of settings, such as hos pitals, alcohol and ot her drug treatment programs, and clinics. The Consensus Panel also supports these key recommendations: The Panel does not support the criminal prosecution of pregna nt, substance-using women. Furthermore, there is no evidence that punitive approaches work. Alcohol and other drug treatment programs must provide serv ices to pregnant women and not deny these services based solely on the fact that a woman is pregnant. Service providers need to be sensitive to the feelings and the cultural background of pregnant, substance-using women and offer car e in an environment that is supportive, nurturing, and nonjudgmental. Early intervention during the prenatal period is encouraged to improve the health of mothers and fetuses and to ensure that alc ohol and other drug trea tment is initiated. Comprehensive medical care and treatment for alcohol and other drug addiction is essential to start substance-us ing women on the road to recovery. This approach, it is hoped, will result in more productive adults, stronger families, and healthier children. A continuum of care -- that is, the long-term provision of servi ces -- is vital to the well- being of pregnant, substance- using women. The continuum of care concept requires the collaboration and cooperation of many community -based services, ranging from agencies that offer safe housing to programs that stre ss parenting education and address the issues of domestic violence, abuse, and victimization. Case management services are needed to en sure that a comprehensive and optimal level of care is available to and accessed by pr egnant, substance-using women and their families. The Consensus Panel encourages service providers to review these guidelines and to use them to identify and coordinate their roles in the care of pregnant women and their families. Finding What You Need in the TIP The information in this TIP is intended to gui de and instruct a broad spectrum of service providers who care for pregnant, substance-using women and their families. Some of the guidelines provide information fo r specific disciplines, such as obstetricians. Other guidelines, such as those on legal and ethical issues, are pert inent to all service provi ders caring for patients. A review of the entire TIP will help providers cr eate and maintain the continuum of care that is vital to the well-being and r ecovery of th eir patients. This report is organized into three chapters. Chapter 1 provides alcohol and other drug tr eatment guidelines. These guidelines describe the comprehensive array of treatme nt and case management services needed by patients. The guidelines also make it clear that women function as part of larger family groups and must not be treated in a vacuum. Chapter 2 presents standard obstetrical proce dures for the care of substance-using women. Equally important, these guidelines identify additional medically relevant factors that may result from a woman's substance-using lifestyle. Chapter 3 presents legal and ethical guidelines for the care of women and their children. Issues concerning confidentiality, repor ting, and child protection are addressed. This report also includes endnot es and several appendixes. The endnotes provide references for specific statements of fact made in the TIP. The vast majority of information presented in this report is not reference d, however, since it was developed through a consensus process and is the unique product of the experience and expertise of panel members. Appendix A consists of guideline s for training staff. Appendix B presents information about a selected group of standard instruments; some are examples of instruments that have been adapted to the special needs of particular programs. These instruments are used by prof essionals to assess a patient's alcohol and other drug use, and psychosocial and mental health functioning. Appendix C contains a model program, sample budget, and list of Medicaid reimbursement rates for sele cted medical procedures. Appendix D provides a discussion of quality assurance. Appendix E offers a glossary of terms used in the TIP. Appendix F consists of a bibliography and a re source list of selected national organizations that can provide informati on and assistance to service providers. Appendix G lists the members of the Federal Resource Panel on Pregnant, Substance- Using Women. Appendix H lists other contributors to the TIP, including programs from which relevant materials were obtained, and the names and a ffiliations of experts from the field who reviewed the document. Appendix I provides two comprehensive care flow charts for pregnant, substance-using women, depending on whether the point of en try to treatment is through alcohol and other drug treatment or through pr enatal care. The ch arts are perforated for easy removal.

TIP 2: Chapter 1\u2014Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Guidelines for Pregnant, Substance-Using Women Overview Traditionally, alcohol and other drug treatment programs served adult males, and few women received the treatment they n eeded. The scarcity of treatment services for women continues today. It is imperative that programs include services desi gned specifically for women, particularly pregnant women. Many alcohol and other drug treatment program s do not accept pregnant women because of liability issues or a lack of knowledge about pregnancy. Fu rthermore, programs have not had access to standardized gu idelines for treatment, case management, and followup services. The information that follows offers such guidance an d is intended to encourage programs to broaden and strengthen their services to pregnant, substance-using women. Profile of the Women Being Served Reliable national estimates of the prevalence of alcohol and other drug use by pregnant women are not available. Several fact ors limit the accuracy and usef ulness of current estimates, including differences in the populat ions studied, the lack of repr esentativeness of samples used, and differences in the methods employed to determ ine drug use. Results of specific studies, such as those reported below, illustrate to some degree the nature and extent of the problem. Data from one study of 36 hospitals, mainly in urban areas, were extrap olated to arrive at an estimate of 375,000 infants exposed in utero to illegal drugs each year, or 11 percent of all births. 5 A study conducted in Pinellas County, Florida, of urine samples from more than 700 women enrolling in prenatal care during a 1-month period in 1989 found little difference in the prevalence of drug and alcohol use between women seen at public clinics (16.3 percent) and those seen at private offices (13.1 percent), as well as similar rates of substance abuse among white women (15.4 pe rcent) and black women (14.1 percent).6 A study based on a review of medical records in eight hospitals in Philadelphia in 1989 found that 16.3 percent of women had used cocaine while pregnant.7 A study that assessed drug use, utilizing urin e samples obtained at admission for delivery in all seven hospitals in Rhode Island, showed that 3 per cent of women used marijuana.8 Fifty-nine percent of the women in a Bost on City Hospital study acknowledged that they had consumed alcohol during their pregnancies.9 To meet the need for estimates of the preval ence of alcohol and other drug use by pregnant women that are generalizable to the Nation, th e National Institute on Drug Abuse has recently sponsored a national, hospital-based study known as the National Pregnancy and Health Survey. Until these and other data become available, serv ice providers should be alert to patterns of alcohol and other drug use occurring locally among women of all socioeconomic and ethnic groups. Those with clinical experience in treati ng substance-using wome n have found that the therapeutic needs of women, especially those wi th children, are markedly different from the needs of men. Substance-using women come fr om every ethnic and socioeconomic group and have a multitude of needs. Moreover, a substa ntial portion of the women who seek publicly supported treatment for their addict ions share a core group of problems that reflect problems of the communities in which they live. Unless these core problems are addressed, women will be unable to take full advantage of the therapeutic process. Many women who seek treatment for their alc ohol and other drug problems through publicly funded programs share the follo wing characteristics: Function as single parents and receive little or no financial support fr om the birth fathers Lack employment skills and educatio n and are unemployed or underemployed Live in unstable or unsafe environments, in cluding households where others use alcohol and other drugs. Many women are at risk of being homeless and some are homeless. Lack transportation and face extreme difficu lty getting to and from a variety of appointments, including treatment Lack child care and baby-s itting options and are unabl e to enroll in treatment Experience special therapeutic needs, in cluding problems with codependency, incest, abuse, victimization, sexuality, and re lationships involving significant others Experience special medical need s, including gynecological problems Gender\u00adSpecific Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Alcohol and other drug treatment providers need to understand and address the specific problems pregnant, substance-using women face in accessi ng and participating in treatment. Treatment programs may lack linkages to medi cal services, especially prenatal care. Similarly, providers of prenatal care have a poor unders tanding of addiction and treatment issues and may not have appropriate linkages with alcohol and other drug treatment provid ers. Both prenatal and drug treatment providers have a poor understandi ng of treatment issues specific to women. It is recommended that treatment programs servi ng pregnant, substance-us ing women include the following services, or support activ e outreach to and linkage with appropriate service resources already available in the community: Comprehensive inpatient and out patient treatment on demand Comprehensive medical services Gender-specific services that ar e also ethnically and culturally sensitive. These services must respond to women's needs regarding re productive health, sexua lity, relationships, and all forms of victimization. Services s hould be offered in a nonjudgmental manner and in a supportive environment. Transportation services, includ ing cab vouchers, bus tokens, and alternatives for women who live in communities where public trans portation is cumbersome, unreliable, or unsafe Child care, baby-sitting, and therapeutic day care services for children Counseling services, including indivi dual, group, and family therapy Vocational and educational serv ices leading to training for meaningful employment, the General Equivalency Diploma (GED), and higher education Drug-free, safe housing Financial support services Case management services Pediatric followup and early intervention services Services that recognize the unique needs of pregnant, adolesce nt substance-users In addition to the delivery of direct services, th ere is a need for continuing collaborative efforts by maternal and child health programs, primary h ealth care agencies, mental health agencies, and alcohol and other drug programs. Such collaboration can be useful in conducting needs assessments, designing interdisci plinary strategies, and establ ishing linkages through memoranda of understanding and interagency agreements. Ongoing technical assistance and tr aining is recommended for all h ealth care, alcohol and other drug treatment, and other social service providers . Such efforts must involve administrative staff as well as direct service personne l to ensure that s upportive, appropriate, and comprehensive care is offered to pregnant, substance-using women. Preconception Counseling All women who receive alcohol a nd other drug treatment services should receive counseling on the full range of reproductive op tions, including preconception couns eling. Issues that should be thoroughly discussed include The various methods of contraception and the attitudes of the woman, her significant others, and her community regarding their use The impact on the woman and the fetus of alcohol and other drug use during pregnancy The teratogenic impact of prescribed me dications, such as Antabuse and various anticonvulsants Alternative medications with reduced or no teratogenic potential for such common problems as seizure disorder. An obstetric ian or geneticist can recommend such medications. For patients who temporarily require medications such as Antabuse, or for those who choose to postpone childbearing, an effective, reversible form of contraception should be recommended. Substance-using women who have a history of irregular menses and involuntary infertility should be warned that sobriety or the successful initiation of a recovery program may result in a resumption of ovulation and an increa sed risk for unplanned pregnancy. Access to Services Pregnant, substance-using women may access health care services from a variety of sites, including emergency rooms, pregnancy testing sites, clinics treating sexually transmitted diseases, community health centers, and clinic s of the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Occasiona lly, alcohol and other drug treatment program staff are the first to notice that a woman is pregnant. Regardless of where she accesses care, appropriate referrals for prenatal care should be provided, and sh e should be assisted to follow through on these referrals. The two perforat ed charts that acc ompany this TIP as Appendix I illustrate the components of comprehensive heal th care, depending on whether the woman's point of entry into the treatment system is alcohol and other drug treatment or prenatal care. Access to care must be simplified for a woman wh en she enters the system. She should receive whatever support is needed -- whether it is financ ial assistance, help in setting up appointments, or transportation and child care services. Whenever possible, a case manager should schedule a specific prenatal appointment for the woman and initiate other needed services. In addition, a psychiatric assessment should be done to iden tify cases of alcohol and other drug use and psychiatric illness. It may be difficult to convince a pregnant, subs tance-using woman to seek prenatal care. The concept of preventive health care, as opposed to emergency-necessitated health care, may be a foreign concept to her. More importantly, she may have a basic distrust or dislike of the health care system in general, and doctors in particul ar. Her feelings of fear and guilt, and possible negative past experiences, may cause her to expect poor treatment. Sometimes she provokes a hostile interchange with h ealth care professionals. Women need to receive health care services in an environment that is nonjudgmental, nonpunitive, nurturing, and culturally and linguistically sensitive. It is essential for all members of the health care team, from the clerical staff to the physicians, to rec ognize the importance of providing prenatal, postnatal, and pe diatric services in a caring way. Staff must avoid comments designed to make the patient feel guilty or ashamed, such as th e use of pejorative words like \"wino\" or \"junkie.\" Each health care visit is an opportunity to provide positive reinforcement to the substance-using patient. Scope of the Guidelines These alcohol and other drug treatment guidelines discuss the continuum of care and the central role of case management that are essential fo r the delivery of comprehensive services to pregnant, substance-using women and their fami lies. Medical stabilization and withdrawal guidelines establish a basis for alcohol and ot her drug treatment. Specific guidelines cover alcohol, opioids, cocaine, and se dative-hypnotic drugs. A review of mental health considerations in treating pregnant, substance-us ing women completes the chapter. Guideline 1\u2014Continuum of Care The pregnant, substance-using woman requires a continuum of care that includes a broad range of support services provided ove r an extended period of time. This continuum of care should reflect the complexity of her multiple roles as a person in recovery, parent, partner, and frequently, single head of a household. Ideally, support services should be provided as long as the woman and her family need and can benefit fro m them, potentially until her last child reaches adulthood. In reality, support servic es may be available for a period of a few months to several years. The case management function is essential for the recovery and well-being of the substance- using woman and her family. Virtually any ag ency can provide case management services, although the lead agency typically assigns an appropriate staff person to this role, such as a social worker or nurse. The case manager assist s the patient in accessing services, and monitors her participation and progress in using health care, alcohol and ot her drug treatment, and other social services. The multiple services coordinated by the case manager are generally provided by a variety of agencies. Many of these services are initiated during or even prior to pregnancy and should continue after delivery for as long as they are appropriate. The consortium of service providers may change over time, depending on the family's individual circumstances and resources. The case manager should be aware that differences in philosophies may ex ist between health and social service agencies and the alcohol and othe r drug treatment field. Beha viors that health and social service agencies view as helping and supportive are often viewed as codependent behaviors by the treatment field. As agencies work together on behalf of patients, they too must recognize and handle complex and legitimate differences in philosophies and practices. Case Management Case management is a vital function that helps to ensure that patients r eceive and appropriately utilize a variety of services necessary for th eir improved functioning. Case management should be initiated prenatally and c ontinue throughout the postpartum period for all substance-using women. Services should be provided and mainta ined as appropriate fo r the individual woman and her family. The case manager should support and guide the patient to address issues concerning her recovery from alcohol and other drug abuse, develop psychosocial and parenting skills, and meet her survival needs. Key case management functions include 1A review and assessment covering Physical and mental health history Psychosocial status, including family hist ory, parenting skills and knowledge, and potential parenting problems (e .g., a history of sexual abuse) Alcohol and other drug use, trea tment, and recovery status Support systems available to and used by the family, including sources of primary and emergency care Nutritional status of the mother and fetus Status of any unresolved legal issues, includ ing outstanding warrants, domestic violence, child custody, adoption, fo ster care, and divorce Environmental circumstances, including financ ial status and needs, condition of housing, and availability of transportation Educational and vocational competencies Involvement with other so cial service agencies 2An individual care plan prepared in conjunction with the patient and other service providers. This plan should address, at a minimum, the ar eas listed above. It may also cover arrangements for infant case management, eith er directly or through referral. 3Discussion of the plan with the patient and other members of her health care and service delivery team. After agreement is reached on the individual plan, the case manager should schedule the needed services. 4Referrals to other agencies, groups, or institutions as needed. These referral linkages should be made in conjunction with plans for ongoi ng communication about th e patient's status. 5Monitoring of the patient's progress in the programs in which she is enrolled, with followup contacts made if she fails to pa rticipate as planned and scheduled. 6Ongoing case management support at regularly scheduled interv als, with termination ideally agreed upon by the patient and the case manager. Standards of success should be determined on an individual basis, but should allow a period of ti me for the patient to become adjusted to her drug-free status, to achieve self-sufficiency, a nd to feel confident about her parenting skills. 7A review of the patient's individual care plan with revisions as needed during the recovery process Comprehensive Service Delivery The delivery of comprehensive services to s ubstance-using women and their families should continue postpartum. The gr eatest success is achieved by and for these women when a continuum of care is available to address their special needs as women, mothers, spouses, and heads of households. The following services are often needed: 1 Health Care Services Comprehensive, high-risk obstetrical care HIV antibody counseling and testing Routine checkups and immunizations for all chil dren through a well-baby clinic, care by a pediatrician or other physician for specifi c health concerns as long as needed, and referral to early intervention programs Postpartum medical and dental checkups for the mother as long as needed Family planning, including contracep tive counseling and contraceptives Counseling for postpartum depression and for gu ilt about the effects of prenatal drug use on the infant, as needed Health care for other family members 2Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Services Medical withdrawal,10 as needed, in collaboration with prenatal care providers Ongoing alcohol and other drug treatment thr ough a program of methadone maintenance, outpatient treatment, day treatment, or intensiv e outpatient care; or through intermediate or long-term residential care that provides services to a patien t's children during the inpatient period Alcohol and other drug treatme nt in gender-specific program s that are ethnically and culturally sensitive, whenever possible Continuing support and relapse preventi on through accessible community groups, including Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narc otics Anonymous (NA) , Adult Children of Alcoholics (ACoA), Talking Circles, and co mmunity and church support groups, with the understanding that relapse should not exclude women from treatment Group and individual counseling, focusing on su ch areas as codepe ndency, self-esteem, and issues of sexuality, parent ing, and relapse prevention 3Survival-Related Services Housing assistance to find drug-free, affordab le family housing, emergency shelters, safe homes Financial assistance through Medicaid and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), as well as food from programs such as the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Child ren (WIC), if eligible Vocational and job skills training with ch ild care and/or tran sportation services Child care that is affordable and appropriate for the safety and well-being of the child. Programs should encourage the creation of a nd access to therapeutic and developmental child care centers onsite and in the community. Transportation for medical care, alcohol and ot her drug treatment, and for child care, and for vocational, parenting, homemaking, and recreational activities Home management training to develop nut rition, budgeting, time management, and food preparation skills Legal services for such issues as domestic violence, child custody, adoption, and divorce 4Psychosocial Services Training in stress management and reduction; as sertiveness; issues of sexism, racism, and class bias; and anger management Group, individual, and family counseling conc erning sexual and physical abuse and their prevention Relationship and interpersonal skill building Personal care, issues of sexuality, and image enhancement Psychiatric and other mental health services, as needed by the woman, her children, and other family members 5Parenting and Family Services Planning and counseling for reunification with the patient's other children Counseling for women who wish to breastfeed regarding the risks to the infant of maternal drug use and from possible transm ission of HIV; training in breastfeeding procedures, as appropriate Education about child and adult nutritional needs, food purchasing and preparation, and weight management Education about and training in child growth and development patterns Training in and support for nonpuniti ve child-rearing practices Assistance with and counseling about mate rnal and child bonding; participation in parental support groups Counseling for couples or significant othe rs in communication, money management, crisis management, and parenting Counseling and intervention concerning child abuse and neglect, as needed Education about family systems, including in formation about cultures, traditions, and heritage Family therapy, as needed Guideline 2\u2014Medical Stabilization and Withdrawal The initial stabilization as well as the medical withdrawal of pr egnant women from their drug(s) of abuse are recognized means of reducing the acute illness associ ated with the use of alcohol and other drugs. The initial stabilization of the patient should be accomplished within 10 days of first contact or earlier if medica lly necessary. The goals listed on next two pages may be attained by one agency or a collaboration of agencies within the comm unity. The latter option requires appropriate cross-traini ng between agencies. During the period of stabilization, caregivers need to monitor the mother and fetus for adverse signs of drug withdrawal, establish a basis for ongoing alcohol and other drug treatment and recovery, and initiate a relations hip between the mother and avai lable supportive services within the community. The lead agency is generally responsible for assigning an appropriate staff person to undertake case management functions. Th e role of the case manager is to monitor and promote completion of this initial phase. The procedures to be completed for the initial stabilization of pregnant , substance-using women are presented on the following two pages. They also apply to all of the specific medical withdrawal guidelines that follow. Medical and Obstetrical Assessment 1 Follow universal precautions for blood and body fluids and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards. Staff in health care facilities, especially those working with patients with histories of alcohol and other drug use, should be well vers ed in the appropriate application of the preca utions and standards. 2 Obtain a detailed history and comprehensive ph ysical examination that includes an obstetrical evaluation. 3 Conduct a laboratory evaluation, including but not limited to, complete blood count (CBC), sequential multichannel autoanaly zer (SMA) 18, serological test fo r syphilis, and urine analy-sis. Obtain results from the prenatal panel if they ar e available. If the woman is admitted before an initial prenatal examination has been performed, all prenatal laboratory tests should be done (see Guideline 8-Prenatal Intake). 4 Discuss HIV and document the discussion on the chart. 5 Obtain urine toxicologies or blood alcohol level te sts as necessary (see Guideline 15-Urine Toxicology Considerations). 6 Perform fetal assessment, including a base line sonogram, Non-Stre ss Tests (NSTs), or biophysical profiles appropriate for gestational age, as necessary. 7 Make other referrals as necessary. Alcohol and Other Drug Use Assessment 1 Obtain a history of alcohol and other drug use, covering legal and ille gal drugs (prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, alcohol, cigarettes), that includes Duration of use, including age of first use Frequency, type, amount, and periods of abstinence Routes of administration Social context of use (when, where, and with whom the patient uses) Past treatment history Support group involvement 2 Determine the consequences of alcohol and other drug use for the patient (selfperceived and objective). 3 Identify relapse factors for the patient. 4 Obtain a family history of alcohol and other drug use. 5 Assess the patient's motivation for treatment, including self-perceived and objective difficulties in entering treatment. 6 Assess the patient's motivation for con tinued use of alcohol and other drugs. 7 Obtain urine and/or blood toxicologies as needed (see Guidelin e 15-Urine Toxicology Considerations). Psychosocial Assessment 1 Assess the patient's support systems, includi ng her role in family and neighborhood support systems, and the stresses created by these systems. 2 Assess the patient's perception of her pregnancy and pregnancy options. 3 Assess the patient's educational level. 4 Assess the patient's employment skills. 5 Assess abuse and neglect experienced by the pa tient as an adult and as a child, including Sexual abuse Physical abuse and neglect Emotional abuse 6 Assess legal considerations and problems. 7 Assess current crises. 8 Assess the patient's current life and environmental situation, including Housing Transportation Child care Monetary support and assistance 9 Assess the patient's relationship to her other children. Mental Health Assessment 1 Conduct a mental health evaluation that includes Mental status examination Psychiatric symptomatology Past psychiatric history and treatment Suicide risk Family psychiatric history DSM-III-R diagnosis Treatment recommendations 2 Use standardized psychiatric evaluation tools in diagnosis and followup. 3 Maintain liaison and ongoing contact with ot her members of the assessment and treatment team. Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Planning 1 Prepare a treatment plan with input from the patient and repres entatives from all participating health care and service ag encies, that includes Appropriate alcohol a nd other drug treatment Medical and obstetrical care Followup services 2 Facilitate the introduction of the patient into alcohol and other drug treatment by contacting the patient at any point of entry for service or place of evaluation. Guideline 3\u2014Medical Withdrawal From Alcohol 11 It should be assumed that pre gnant women who consume over 8 oun ces of [absolute] alcohol (1 pint of liquor) daily ha ve developed tolerance.12 However, tolerance may develop at lower levels of consumption in some women and in women using multiple drugs. The sudden cessation of drinking can result in withdrawal symptoms, so me of which may be threatening to the mother and the fetus. It is imperative that medical w ithdrawal of an alcohol- dependent, pregnant woman be c onducted in an inpatient setti ng and under medical supervision that includes collaboration with an obst etrician. These conditions will ensure Close observation and monitoring of ma ternal alcohol withdrawal status Continual monitoring of fetal well-being Most programs choose to treat the pregnant , alcohol-dependent woman with short-acting barbiturates or (Valium) and barbiturates (Phenobarbita l, Seconal), are valuable for symptomatic treatment during medical withdrawal from alcohol . They are also potentia lly teratogenic. Some clinicians, therefore, recommend avoiding their use if at all po ssible. The risks versus the possible benefits of their use need to be assessed. Disulfiram (Antabuse) is contraindicated duri ng pregnancy. Its use has been associated with clubfoot, VACTERL syndrome (a pattern of congen ital anomalies), and phocomelia of the lower extremities.13 The woman who conceives while taking this drug should receive counseling before deciding to continue the pregnancy. Symptoms of Alcohol Withdrawal Early symptoms of alcohol withdrawal generally appear 6 to 48 hours after drinking has stopped but can occur up to 10 days after the la st drink. Withdrawal sy mptoms may include Restlessness Tachycardia Irritability Hypertension Anorexia Insomnia Nausea Nightmares Vomiting Impaired concentration Sweating Impaired memory Tremor Elevated vital signs More severe symptoms of alcohol withdrawal may include Increased tremulousness Increased agitation Increased sweating Delirium (with confusion, disorientation, impaired memory and judgment) Hallucinations (auditory, visual, or tactile) Delusions (usually paranoid) Grand mal seizures Note: Withdrawal symptoms do not necessarily progress from mild to severe. In some individuals, a grand mal seizure may be the first sign of withdrawal. Seizures usually occur 12 to 24 hours after cessation or reduction of drinking. Onethird of all patients who have seizures develop delirium tremens. Maternal and Fetal Effects of Alcohol Alcohol use during pregnancy may be associated with a variety of serious health consequences for the woman, the fetus, and the subsequent infant. 1Possible maternal complications of excessive alcohol consumption: Nutritional deficiencies Pancreatitis Alcoholic ketoacidosis Precipitate labor Alcoholic hepatitis Deficient milk ejection Cirrhosis 2Possible effects on the fetus: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) o prenatal/postnatal growth retardation o central nervous system deficits, including developmental delay and neurological/intellectual impairments o facial feature anomalies, including microcephaly Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE) o cardiac abnormalities o neonatal irritability and hypotonia o hyperactivity o genitourinary abnormalities o skeletal and muscular abnormalities o ocular problems o hemangiomas No effect Guidelines for Medical Withdrawal From Alcohol Procedures at the Time of Admission 1 Obtain a detailed health hi story, including alcohol and other drug use and arrangements for prenatal care. 2 Conduct a comprehensive physical examinati on, including weight, vital signs, and an obstetrical evaluation. 3 Obtain laboratory tests, includ ing: a) Initial blood workup that includes, but is not limited to Blood group, Rh factor determination, and antibody screen Serological test for syphilis Hepatitis B and C screens Complete blood count with indices b) Other initial laboratory tests that include, but are not limited to Cervical cytology smear (Pap smear), unless th e provider has results of a test performed within the past 3 months Cervical culture for gonorrhea Urine screen for urinary tract infectio n, kidney disease, protein, and glucose Chlamydia screen 4 Obtain purified protein derivative of tube rculin (PPD) test with antigen panel. 5 Obtain urine and/or blood toxicologies (see Urine Toxicolo gy Considerations). 6 Provide for HIV antibody counseling and testing. 7 Obtain baseline sonogram if appropriate. Dosing Strategy 1 Evaluate the pattern, frequency, and amount of alcohol and other drug use. 2 Obtain a detailed history of alcohol and othe r drug use within the past 24 hours and of any previous alcohol withdrawal reaction. 3 Begin initial treatment with thiamine, folic acid, and prenatal iron and vitamins. Obtain laboratory tests listed above, including CBC, electrolytes, an d magnesium level and, when indicated, obtain an el ectrocardiogram (EKG). 4 Obtain an initial blood al cohol level to determine Extent of intoxication at admission Safe time to begin medication Expected time for full withdrawal to begin. The usual rate of elimination of alcohol from a healthy alcohol dependent pe rson is 30 mg/dl/hr. This rate may be increased during pregnancy. 5 Provide for nonpharmacological interventions designed to Reduce stimuli Maintain hydration Maintain reality orientation Provide reassurance and positive reinforcement Provide nutritional support Maintain physical comfort Maintain body temperature Encourage sleep and rest 6 Follow withdrawal schedule. Programs use differe nt drugs to withdraw patients from alcohol. Drugs used include chlordiazepox ide, phenobarbital, and diazepam. Typical withdrawal schedules using chlordiaze-poxide includ e 25 to 50 mg 4 times a day for the first 2 days, decreasing gradually to 10 mg 4 times a day for days 8 through 10. Typical withdrawal schedules using phenobarbital include 15 to 60 mg by mouth every 4 to 6 hours as needed for the first 2 days, d ecreasing gradually to 15 mg by the 4th day. Typical withdrawal schedules using diazepam include 10 mg 4 times a day; 10 mg every 2 hours as needed for withdrawal sympto ms with a maximum of 150 mg/24 hours; decreasing gradually at a rate of 20 to 25 percent over approximately 5 days. The loading dose protocol with diazepam is accomplished w ith doses given according to withdrawal symptomatology. When withdrawal symptoms are stabilized, the long half- life of diazepam alleviates the need for further medication in most cases. 7 Monitor for signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). The use of withdrawal assessment scales can be valuable in determining the need for further medication. Monitor for the following: Vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse) Delirium (orientation) Wernicke's encephalopathy (nystagmus) Psychosis (hallucinations, inappropriate thinking) Irritability (tremors, increased reflexes) Increased autonomic reflexes (goosebumps, sweating) Fetal well-being (fetal heart tones, sonograms, or Non-Stre ss Test) as appropriate for gestational age 8 Reduce medication dose if the pati ent shows signs of oversedation. 9 Provide for positive social support for the patient to help manage stress. 10 Discharge the patient after medical withdrawal to the care of a case manager for continuing treatment and prenatal care. Guideline 4\u2014Opioid Stabilization 14 The following approaches are used to manage the pregnant, opioid-addi cted woman. The first approach is methadone maintenance combined with psychosocial counseling. This is a well- documented approach to improve outcomes for both the woman and her fetus. The second approach is slow medical withdrawal with methadone. The safety of this second approach has not been documented. Opioid Withdrawal Signs and Symptoms Mild withdrawal signs and symptoms include Generalized anxiety Opioid craving Restlessness Slight aching of muscles, joints, and bones Lower back pain Mild to moderate withdrawal signs and symptoms include Tension Yen sleep (mild insomnia) Mydriasis (pupils dilated) Lethargy Diaphoresis (increased perspiration) Moderate withdrawal signs and symptoms include Chills alternating with flushing and diaphoresis (sweating) Nausea and/or stomach cramps Rhinorrhea (runny nose) Moderate aching of muscles, joints, and bones Lower back pain Anorexia Nausea and/or stomach cramps Yawning Lacrimation (tearing) Goose flesh (earlier if client is in a cold, drafty room) Elevated pulse and blood pressure Moderate to severe withdrawal signs and symptoms include Diarrhea Vomiting Tremors Tachycardia (pulse over 100 BPM) Increased respirator y rate and depth Severe withdrawal signs and symptoms include Doubling over with stomach cramps Kicking movements Elevated temperature (usually low grade, less than 100\u00b0 F) Note: Withdrawal signs and symptoms differ in their order of appearance from one individual to another. Some individuals may not exhibit certain withdrawal signs and symptoms. Signs may also include uterine irritability, increased fetal activity, or rarely, hypotension. Symptoms of Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome Despite its dramatic appearance, the opioid with drawal syndrome is rarely life-threatening or permanently disabling to an adult. However, th ere is good evidence that the fetus may be more susceptible to withdrawal symptoms than the mo ther. In the mother, the initial signs of opioid withdrawal progress to increas ingly painful physical symptoms . In addition to these signs, patients show compelling psychological cravings for drugs, as well as drug-seeking behavior. Methadone substitution is the standard treatm ent for heroin addiction. Methadone treatment alternatives consist of (1) high-dose blockage; (2) low-dose maintenance; and (3) medical withdrawal. Medical withdrawal of the opioi d-dependent woman is not recommended in pregnancy because of the increased risk to the fetus of intrauterine death. Methadone maintena nce is the treatment of choice. In addition to methadone maintenance, a comprehensive approach is needed that will provide the patient with c ounseling and other services. The administration of methadone, combined w ith any opioid agonist/a ntagonist such as (Talwin), will precipitate withdrawal.15 Any pregnant woman receiving methadone should be advised against taking opioid a gonist/antagonists unde r all circumstances. Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS ) may or may not be related to maternal dose of methadone; NAS may also be related to fetal gestational ag e and infant weight. However, studies in both pregnant women and other adults have shown th at larger doses of methadone result in a decreased use of other drugs. Maternal and Fetal Effects of Opioids These effects may be the result of concomitant ma ternal lifestyle factors rather than the direct result of drug use. 1Possible effects on the pregnancy: Toxemia Intrauterine growth retardation Miscarriage Premature rupture of membranes Infections Breech presentation (abnormal presentation due to premature delivery) Preterm labor No effect 2Possible effects on the mother: Poor nourishment, with vitamin deficiencies , iron deficiency anemia, and folic acid deficiency anemia Medical complications from frequent us e of dirty needles (abscesses, ulcers, thrombophlebitis, bacterial endocarditis, he patitis, and urinary chlam ydia, syphilis, herpes, and HIV infection) Hypertensive disorder No effect 3Possible effects on the fetus and newborn infant: Low birth weight Prematurity Neonatal abstinence syndrome Stillbirth Sudden infant death syndrome No effect Opioid Conversion and Methadone Stabilization The goal of the methadone strategy is to stabilize the patient wit hout producing any indication of opioid abstinence syndrome. Procedures at the Time of Admission 1 Obtain a detailed health hi story, including alcohol and other drug use and arrangements for prenatal care. 2 Conduct a comprehensive physical examinati on, including weight, vital signs, and an obstetrical evaluation. 3 Obtain laboratory tests, including a) Initial blood workup that includes, but is not limited to Blood group, Rh factor determination, and antibody screen Serological test for syphilis Hepatitis B and C screens Complete blood count with indices b) Other initial laboratory tests th at include, but are not limited to Cervical cytology smear (Pap smear), unless th e provider has results of a test performed within the past 3 months Cervical culture for gonorrhea Urine screen for urinary tract infectio n, kidney disease, protein, and glucose Chlamydia screen 4 Obtain purified protein derivative of tube rculin (PPD) test with antigen panel. 5 Obtain urine and/or blood toxicologies (see Guideline 15 -- Urine Toxicology Considerations ). 6 Provide for HIV antibody counseling and testing. 7 Obtain baseline sonogram if appropriate. Methadone Dosing Strategy Determine the amount of drug being used a nd follow the dosing strategy listed below. 1 Evaluate the pattern of drug use, route of administration, and frequency and amount of drug use. Know something about the purity of the st reet product and the othe r substances, such as quinine or Valium, with which the product may be cut or diluted. 2 Obtain a detailed history of drug use within the past 24 hours. 3 Give an initial oral methadone dose of 10 to 40 mg. Because it is imperative to reverse any opioid abstinence symptoms as quickly as possi ble, an additional dose of methadone may be required in the range of 5 to 10 mg if objective signs of withdrawal pe rsist after 3 to 4 hours (time to allow the methadone to reach a peak blo od level). This 5- to 10-mg dose can be repeated at 3 to 4 hour intervals until objective si gns of withdrawal are no longer present. 4 Adjust the dosage by 5 to 10 mg daily based on physical signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal (see table ) and patient comfort. Even minimal sy mptoms in the mother may indicate stress in the fetus. 5 After the stabilization dose has been established, keep the patient at this level for several days. 6 If there is simultaneous dependence on other dr ugs such as alcohol, cocaine, and sedatives, methadone induction should proceed as outlined in items 1 through 5, while concurrent medical withdrawal procedures are initiat ed. The other drug withdrawals can be managed as usual against the background of methadone maintenance. Id eally, this is an i npatient procedure. Important Warning: NARCAN (or any narcotic an tagonist) should never be given to a pregnant, substance-using woman except as a last resort to reverse severe narcotic overdose. Administration of a narcotic antagonist to a pregnant, substance-using woman could result in spontaneous abortion, pr emature labor, and/or stillbirth.16 Guidelines for Methadone Maintenance Methadone maintenance is strongly encouraged for all pregnant, opioid-dependent women. It provides the following advantages: Reduces illegal opioid use as well as use of other drugs Helps to remove the opioid-dependent wo man from the drug-seeking environment and eliminates the necessary illegal behavior Prevents fluctuations of the maternal dr ug level that may occur throughout the day Improves maternal nutri tion, increasing the weig ht of the newborn Improves the woman's ability to participate in prenatal care and other rehabilitation efforts Enhances the woman's ability to prepare for the birth of the infant and begin homemaking Reduces obstetrical complications There are no specific guidelines established for methadone dosages for pregnant women. In general, the clinical trend is toward use of an individually determined, most effective dose that is adequate to prevent withdrawal symptoms. The following guidelines have been used for pr egnant and nonpregnant substance users: 1 The high-dose methadone blockage dosag e is between 50 and 150 mg per day. 2 The low-dosage methadone maintenan ce dosage is less than 60 mg per day. Based on current and emerging research, the Na tional Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) suggests that maintenance doses below 60 mg are not effective and hence not appropriate.17 Arbitrary low-dose policies for pregnant a nd nonpregnant patients is often associated with increased drug use as well as reduced program retention. Based on current informed consensus, the most prudent course is to rely on i ndividually determined methadone dosing that is measured by the absence of subjective and object ive abstinence symptoms and the reduction of drug hunger. An increased methadone dosage may be needed in later stages of pregnancy to prevent withdrawal. (The greater plasma volume and rena l blood flow of pregnancy can contribute to a reduced level of methadone in the blood. As a result, the woman's maintenance dose may be insufficient to prevent cravings.) Either administ er methadone twice a day to give a more even blood level throughout the day or raise the single daily dose. Guidelines for Medical Withdrawal From Methadone Medical withdrawal of the pre gnant, opioid-dependent woman from methadone is not indicated or recommended. Few women will have the mo tivation or the psychosocial supports to accomplish and maintain total abstinence. The goal, therefore, is to achieve the best therapeutic dose possible with which the woman feels comfor table. The neonatal abstinence syndrome can be treated with minimal complications. Despite the above caution, at ti mes, medical withdrawal may need to be considered due to logistical or geographic barriers. In these cases, the decision to undertake such a program must be a joint decision between the obstetrician, the woman, and her counselor, with the understanding that few women will be appr opriate candidates for this approach. The woman should understand that sh e must prove she is a candidate for medical withdrawal by complying with prenatal and therapy appointments and supplying clean urines. If at any time the woman is unable to comply with these requireme nts, no further decrease in dosage of methadone should be ordered. 1Timing of withdrawal. There are no research data that suggest withdrawal in one trimester is worse than in others. Some clinical practiti oners indicate concerns regarding methadone withdrawal prior to 14 weeks or after 32 weeks. These concerns are based on the theoretical possibility of an increased in cidence of spontaneous abortion and premature labor. Other clinicians believe that withdrawal can be performed in all trimesters. Patients should be allowed to discontinue w ithdrawal at any time, for any reason, without feelings of guilt. They should then be placed into a methadone maintenance program at a therapeutically sound dose. Clinicians need to be particularly aware that a decrease in methadone dosage could precipitate a relaps e to drug use. Patients in con tinuous treatment who return to illegal drug use should be placed back on metha done. Methadone is preferable to the use of illegal street drugs. 2Withdrawal schedule . Medical withdrawal from methadone is usually done in decrements of 2 to 2 1/2 mg every 7 to 10 days. This proce dure should only be done in conjunction with an obstetrician who can monitor the effects on the fetus. Intrauterine demise (death of the fetus in utero) has been documented as a complication of medical withdrawal even when done under optimal conditions, such as hospitali zation and close fetal monitoring. Note : At the time of publication, there was no protoc ol for medical withdrawal from methadone that had been evaluated in an appropriate number of women with suitable scientific and medical rigor. Opioid Withdrawal Using Clonidine The long-term effects of the use of clonidine in pregnancy are still unknown. Although clonidine hydrochloride has been used safely and effec tively for rapid medical withdrawal in the management of opioid withdrawal in nonpregnant, opioid-depe ndent individuals,18 there are no data concerning its safety in pr egnancy. Further research in th is area needs to be performed before this technique can be recommended as a standard of care for pregnant women. Guideline 5\u2014Cocaine Withdrawal There are no well-documented studies regarding the safety or efficacy of using drugs to medically withdraw pregnant, cocaine-using women. The evidence is extremely limited for all methods of medical withdrawal. Inpatient trea tment is the ideal whenever possible, although these facilities may not always be available. Me dical withdrawal is just the first step in the continuum of care for pregnant, cocaine-depe ndent women. Referral to ongoing alcohol and other drug treatment and relapse pr evention services is essential. Symptoms of Cocaine Withdrawal Withdrawal from cocaine dependence is char acterized by depression, anxiety, and lethargy, which begin to resolve after approximately 1 week. Less common are signs of a paranoid psychosis during withdrawal from chronic use of high doses of cocaine. In cocaine withdrawal, medication is rarely needed for th e serious sequelae that are associat ed with alcohol, barbiturate, and opioid withdrawal. Maternal and Fetal/Infant Effects of Cocaine 1Possible effects of maternal cocaine use during pregnancy: Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) Abruptio placentae Premature labor Spontaneous abortion No effect 2Possible effects on the fetus and newb orn infant that have been reported: Increased congenital anomalies Mild neurodysfunction Transient electroencephalogram abnormalities Cerebral infarction and seizures Vascular disruption syndrome Sudden infant death syndrome Smaller head circumference No effect Guidelines for Withdrawal From Cocaine: Treatment Options There are no data about the effectiveness of the following guidelines in pregnancy. In those guidelines that substitute other drugs, many of the drugs are problematic to the newborn and some have not been confirmed to be safe. Some centers do not generally use antidepressants for cocaine withdrawal depression. However, other pr ograms prescribe antidepressants for the first 5 days to try to reduce the high dropout rate that occurs during this period. Sedatives and/or antidepressants may cause excessive dr owsiness in a cocaine-dependent woman. Cocaine-dependent women who require sedative s and/or antidepressants for any significant length of time often have an endogenous depressi ve disorder. Psychiatric consultation is usually indicated. Procedures at the Time of Admission 1 Obtain a detailed health hi story, including alcohol and other drug use and arrangements for prenatal care. 2 Conduct a comprehensive physical examinati on, including weight, vital signs, and an obstetrical evaluation. 3 Obtain laboratory tests, including a) Initial blood workup that includes, but is not limited to Blood group, Rh factor determination, and antibody screen Serological test for syphilis Hepatitis B and C screens Complete blood count with indices b) Other initial laboratory tests th at include, but are not limited to Cervical cytology smear (Pap smear), unless th e provider has results of a test performed within the past 3 months Cervical culture for gonorrhea Urine screen for urinary tract infectio n, kidney disease, protein, and glucose Chlamydia screen 4 Obtain purified protein derivative of tube rculin (PPD) test with antigen panel. 5 Obtain urine and/or blood toxicologies (see Guideline 15 -- Urine Toxicology Considerations ). 6 Provide for HIV antibody counseling and testing. 7 Obtain baseline sonogram if appropriate. Dosing Strategy Determine the amount of drug being used a nd follow the dosing strategy listed below. 1 Evaluate the pattern of drug use, route of administration, and frequency and amount of drug use. 2 Obtain a detailed history of drug use within the past 24 hours. To withdraw a pregnant woman depende nt on cocaine, the following are options. 1 No medications . Pregnant patients who are withdrawi ng from cocaine should not be medicated except in cases of extreme agitation and by i ndividual order of the health care provider. 2Anxiolytics . If medication is needed, low doses of diazepam (Valium) or chlordiazepoxide (Librium) (25 mg by mouth, 4 times a day, x 6 doses) may be used. 3Antidepressants . A typical withdrawal guideline for cocaine-dependent women uses doxepin (Sinequan) or desipramine (Norpramin). For example, Days 1-2: Doxepin 25 mg (one tablet) by mouth 2 times a day, 50 mg maximum. Days 3-5: Doxepin 25 mg (one tablet) by mouth 2 times a day, then discontinue. Further therapy should be determined by the treating physician after an initial period of observation. No drug therapy is usually indi cated after the first 5 days. 4Barbiturates . For cocaine withdrawal symptoms: Days 1-2: Phenobarbital 30 to 60 mg every 4 hours as needed. Days 3-4: Phenobarbital 30 to 60 mg every 6 hours as needed. 5Bromocriptine . Bromocriptine, a drug used to treat menstrual abnorma lities and infertility in women, has provided striking and consistent relief from cocai ne craving among inpatients. Research indicates that cocaine, when used by the first-time user, seems to stimulate dopamine and also blocks the reuptake of dopamine, wh ich produces the cocaine high. The brains of regular users of cocaine cannot make dopamine as quickly as the cocaine demands; the result is an eventual depletion that creates the crashing and craving effects. The use of bromocriptine in pregnancy is not recommended because of the lack of proven efficacy and unknown effects, both short and long term, on the fetus. 6Acupuncture . Acupuncture has been used in the treatm ent of cocaine addiction. Traditional use of acupuncture for other disorders has usually been contraindicated in pregnancy. At the time of publication, the National Institute on Drug Abuse ha s not concluded its evaluation of the efficacy of this treatment. Guideline 6\u2014Sedative-Hypnotic Medical Withdrawal Inpatient medical withdrawal from barbiturat es, benzodiazepines, a nd other sedative-hypnotic drugs is recommended because continual monitori ng of the mother and the fetus is required. Drug doses must be tapered so that mother and fetus arrive at a drug-free state without experiencing an uncontrolled withdrawal. Barbiturates and benzodiazepines are the most commonly abused sedative-hypnotics. There are marked similarities between the withdrawal synd romes seen with both of these drugs. Patients abruptly withdrawn from large doses of benzodi azepines may sustain withdrawal symptoms that closely resemble those associated with barb iturate physical dependence. Because of these similarities, only the barbiturate abstinence syndrome is presente d in this guideline. Symptoms of Barbiturate Abstinence Syndrome The barbiturate abstinence syndrome begins 6 to 24 hours after the last dose, and symptoms are generally more severe with th e short-acting barbiturates. Signs and symptoms of barbiturate abstinence include Tremulousness Diaphoresis Anxiety Postural hypotension Insomnia Grand mal convulsions (between days 3 and 7) Agitation Anorexia Delirium Nausea and vomiting Tendon hyperreflexia If untreated, withdrawal symptoms can progress to hyperpyrexia, electrolyte abnormalities, cardiovascular collapse, and death. Guidelines for Withdrawal From Sedative \u00adHypnotic Drugs The following recommendations are meant to be ge neric, to allow individual guidelines to be designed for specific treatment settings. Management of Withdrawal Management of withdrawal in patients who may or may not be pregnant can include Substitution of a long-acting agent (phe nobarbital, diazepam, clonazepam), and subsequent withdrawal of this agent Slow withdrawal of the addicting agent Risk categories for severe withdrawal Low risk: Sporadic use of a drug or use for re lief of cocaine-induced anxiety or insomnia. Moderate risk: Daily use of a drug for at le ast 2 to 4 months at a therapeutic level; concomitant alcohol abuse at low doses; history of mild w ithdrawal symptoms. High risk: Prolonged daily use of a drug at hi gher than therapeutic doses; higher use of alcohol; history of seriou s withdrawal symptoms. Highest risk: Previous withdrawal seizures or a history of a seizure disorder that is exacerbated by sedative-hypnotic withdrawal. Some considerations for withdrawa l from sedativehypnotic drugs during pregnancy Severe withdrawal from barbiturates can produce status epileptic us and maternal and fetal respiratory arrest. Immediate obstetr ical intervention an d hospitalization are warranted. Use of dilantin and other anticonvulsants ha ve been considered for a patient with a history of withdrawal seizures. However, these drugs have been associated with congenital anomalies. Therefore, their use in pregnancy must be based on an assessment of the risks versus the benef its. Although there are concerns of teratogenicity regarding benzodiazepines and barbiturates, these appear to have a lower risk versus benefit ratio. Procedures at the Time of Admission 1 Obtain a detailed health hi story, including alcohol and other drug use and arrangements for prenatal care. 2 Conduct a comprehensive physical examinati on, including weight, vital signs, and an obstetrical evaluation. 3 Obtain laboratory tests, including a) Initial blood workup that includes, but is not limited to Blood group, Rh factor determination, and antibody screen Serological test for syphilis Hepatitis B and C screens Complete blood count with indices b) Other initial laboratory tests th at include, but are not limited to Cervical cytology smear (Pap smear), unless th e provider has results of a test performed within the past 3 months Cervical culture for gonorrhea Urine screen for urinary tract infectio n, kidney disease, protein, and glucose Chlamydia screen 4 Obtain purified protein derivative of tube rculin (PPD) test with antigen panel. 5 Obtain urine and/or blood toxicologies (see Guideline 15 -- Urine Toxicology Considerations ). 6 Provide for HIV antibody counseling and testing. 7 Obtain baseline sonogram if appropriate. Dosing Strategy Determine the amount of drug being used a nd follow the dosing strategy listed below. 1 Evaluate the pattern, freque ncy, and amount of drug use. 2 Obtain a detailed history of drug use within the past 24 hours. 3 Document signs and symptoms of withdrawal. The regular use of a standardized withdrawal assessment scale can be helpful. 4 Administer drugs for medical withdrawal. The drugs used for medical withdrawal may vary. For medical withdrawal of patients dependent on barbiturates, minor tr anquilizers, or other sedatives, some programs suggest administering the drug of use. The use of a long-acting drug, such as phenobarbital, diazepam, or clonazepam, may be helpful. 5 Stabilize the patient to suppr ess withdrawal symptoms. Supportiv e measures should include a safe environment with proper nutrition and rest . Frequent reassurance and encouragement are vital. 6 Withdraw the pregnant patient in regular decr ements of from 5 to 10 percent of dose daily. Guideline 7\u2014Mental Health Considerations Mental disorders in pregnant, substance-us ing women often go undetected by health care providers and alcohol and other drug treatment staff. It is essentia l that a dual diagnosis be made, when appropriate, and addressed in subsequent treatment planni ng. The complex combination of pregnancy, addiction, and mental illness requires a carefully coordina ted approach. The following general guidelines can be useful in a ssessing the mental health of pregnant, substance- using women. Mental Health Assessment 19 Distinguish between drug-induced psychi atric symptoms and a major mental disorder . Symptoms such as anxiety, agitation, and paranoia can be manifestations of a state of drug intoxication or of the withdr awal syndrome itself and at times require no medications. Ongoing psychosocial support may help minimize many of these symptoms. @BULLET TEXT = On the othe r hand, confirmed mental illness may necessitate the continuation of medications, such as antidepressants or antip sychotics, which have been previously effective in treating th e underlying disorder. It is mandato ry that a diagnosis of mental illness be ruled out before such medication is st opped. It must be remembered that evidence is inconclusive regarding the safe use of any psychotropic medication in pregnant women. A thorough assessment of the risks versus the benefits must be made prior to administering these medications. Establish any previous history of psychi atric illness before developing the medical withdrawal treatment plan. Efforts should be made to contact previous therapists, treating agencies, and ment al health facilities for this crucial information. Establish communication early in treatmen t with mental health personnel involved in the patient's care . These individuals often can provi de important history, help build an alliance with the patient, support discharge planning, a nd provide assistance in the event of an acute management crisis. Individualize medical withdrawal plans for each patient. Carefully review standard guidelines and amend them if there are signif icant psychiatric problems to be treated. Set up arrangements to involve mental health personnel, where appropriate, in establishing diagnoses and in developing the treatment plan. Continue prescribed medications and provide appropriate followup for patients who enter alcohol and other drug treatment pr ograms with well-documented, diagnosed psychiatric illnesses that requi re psychopharmacologic medication. Continue any prescribed medications , such as methadone and chlordiazepoxide, except as advised by the patient's health and ment al health care providers. Patients should be supported in this decision by treatm ent programs. Some support groups may inappropriately encourage women to abandon all medications. Do not avoid seeking therapy for the patient because of the complex combination of pregnancy, addiction, and psychiatric problem s. Careful planning and staff coordination are usually effective in treatment. Use well-validated psychiatric assessment scales in the diagnosis and followup of individual patients (see Appendix B ). Consider issues of codependency, adult child ren of alcoholics/other addictions, and deep trauma from childhood in the evaluation of patients. Guidelines for Medical Withdrawal Orders for medication should be individualized to minimize th e types and doses prescribed. Psychotropic drugs may need to be prescrib ed throughout medical wi thdrawal. The use of psychotropic drugs must be considered on a case- by-case basis, taking into consideration their effects on the mother and fetus, particularly w ith respect to interactio ns with methadone and possible congenital abnormalities. Behavioral ma nagement techniques should be developed to minimize the need for these medications. Providing adequate staff, structure, limits, and support are important treatment methods. Other Issues Agitation and oppositional or impulsive behavi or can be manifesta tions of cognitive impairments, such as attention deficit disord er, limited intelligence, mild retardation, or psychotic illness. Patients with these behavior s can appear to have di fficulty comprehending or complying with treatment expectations. Awareness of these deficits can he lp staff manage these problems and adapt treatment methods to mi nimize or avoid unnecessary confrontations. Footnotes 5.

TIP 2: Chapter 2\u2014Medical Guidelines for Pregnant, Substance-Using Women Overview Alcohol and other drug use during pregnancy can have detrimental effects -- both specific and nonspecific -- on the perinatal outcome. Specific e ffects of drug use can include facial dysmor- phology and organ system anomalies, such as al cohol- related birth def ects. Pregnant women who use alcohol and other drugs are at an increa sed risk for preterm labor, thereby placing an already compromised fetus at increased risk. Nonspecific effects can include fetal growth retardation, resulting in small infant s and decreased head circumference.20 Substance-using women and their infants are en dangered by the spread of the human immuno- deficiency virus (HIV). The num ber of women who are infected with the virus from shared needles and multiple sexual contacts, and the nu mber of their infants who are infected through mother-to-infant transmission of the viru s, is increasing at an alarming rate.21 Every medical institution should follow Occu- pational Safety and Health Administra tion (OSHA) standards and universal precautions with resp ect to the blood and body fluids of all patients. To use such precautions only with known HIV-infected pers ons or known alcohol and other drug abusers places health care workers at great risk and fosters stereotyping. In this time of excessive use and abuse of alcohol , cigarettes, cocaine, and other drugs, it is clear that wider recognition of such abuse -- as well as active intervention effort s -- are needed. It is also clear that, in addition to the policies a nd procedures usually followed prenatally and during labor, delivery, and postpartum, specific attention must be paid to pregnant, substance-using women and their infants. It is not enough to provide obste trical care to substance-using women; a holistic approach is essential. This approach should in corporate alcohol and other drug tr eatment, as well as help for all of the problems of daily living and survival that conf ront and confound these women. Scope of the Guidelines The following guidelines are designed to ensure that women receive the prenatal care, alcohol and other drug treatment, and comprehensive help they need to provide for their own health and that of their fetuses. In add ition to obstetrical care , the guidelines addres s HIV-infected women, urine and/or blood toxicology, neonatal care, and nutrition. Guideline 8\u2014Prenatal Intake Procedures To Be Done During the First Prenatal Visit 1 Detailed health history, including alcohol and other drug use and psychosocial assessments 2 Comprehensive physical examination, focusi ng on the multiple medical problems of this population 3 Family psychosocial, medical, and alcohol and other drug use history 4 Health, psychosocial, and alcohol and other drug use history of the baby's father 5 Routine prenatal panel, plus other laboratory tests, includi ng urine and/or blood toxicology screening, tuberculin test with an antigen panel, and baseline sonogram 6 Optional tests as needed, including screen ing for human T-cell ly mphotropic virus (HTLV)-I and hepatitis C 7 Attention to areas of special concern in substance-using women 8 Attention to medical complicat ions encountered in pregnancy 9 Referrals to an alcohol and other drug trea tment program, nutriti onal counseling, social services, and other counseling 10 Additional referrals as needed Guidelines for the First Prenatal Visit A number of significant environm ental, psychosocial, and treatment considerations should be taken into account at the time of the woman's first prenatal vis it. These considerations can affect the accurate assessment and successful engagement of the woman in ongoing prenatal care. They are as follows: Services should be provided in a suppor tive, culturally sensitive, and nonjudgmental environment by all health care personnel, from the receptionist to the physician. An assessment should be made of the woma n's literacy and reading level. This assessment should include the woman who is func tionally illiterate or has low literacy in her native tongue as well as in English. Literacy- and reading- level information will affect patient education efforts and the ability to obtain informed consent. The woman may enter prenatal care in different stages of pregnancy and from a variety of settings, including hospital emergency rooms, community health centers, family planning clinics, abortion clinics, or social service o ffices. It is essential to be able to offer assessment, triage, case coordination, and re ferral services from any or all of these settings. Case management services that coordinate the care of the pregnant, substance-using woman and her family are crit ical. Ideally, case conferences and referral to appropriate services should be managed by one h ealth care professional who oversees the multidisciplinary team. An outreach worker w ho visits the woman in her home should be part of this team. The most difficult issue to resolve, given the financial and staffing constraints experienced by most health care and service provi ders, is the identification and designation of a case manager. Counseling about and obtaining of written in formed consent for medical procedures and treatment are important. It is equally impor tant to explain confidentiality, privacy, and other patient rights, as well as legal risks that may be posed by policies of the individual program. The first prenatal visit should establish the comp onents of the continuum of care that will extend through the woman's pregnancy and beyond. The vi sit should include the following components. 1Obtain a detailed health history . This history should cover lega l and illegal drug use and last date of use; drugs used at the time of the fi rst visit; medical histor y; current medications; psychosocial history, including emotional problems , mental illness, and housing and current living arrangements, with a special focus on the pr esence or lack of support systems; complete reproductive history, including curren t and past pregnancies, previ ous preterm deliveries, history of Caesarean sections, birth we ight, number of therapeutic a bortions, menstrual history, and methods of family planning; and sexual histor y, including previous sexually transmitted diseases. 2Conduct a comprehensive physical examination . This examination should be performed during the initial prenatal evaluation. It should include an eval uation of nutritiona l status, height, weight, and blood pressure, as well as an examin ation of the head, neck, breasts, heart, lungs, abdomen, pelvis, rectum, and extremities. Spec ial attention should be given to those organ systems impacted by alcohol and ot her drug use, such as the liver in alcoholics and the skin in injection drug users. During the pelvic examinati on, attention should be given to the size of the uterus in relation to the presum ed duration of the pregnancy. 3Obtain a family psychosocial, medi cal, and substance-using history . This history should cover alcohol and other drug use by all family me mbers, diabetes, tuberculosis, cancer, heart disease (hypertension), congenital malformations, multiple births, and bleeding disorders. If any part of the history will have a significant imp act on the course or outcome of the pregnancy, appropriate followup should be initiated. A visit to the woman's living environment should be an option. 4Obtain a health, psychosocial, and substa nce-using history for the infant's father . This history should cover legal and illegal drug use, alcohol and ot her drugs currently being used, medical history, and mental illness. 5 Complete a prenatal panel that includes Initial blood workup for all women that includes, but is not limited to o Blood group, Rh factor determination, and antibody screen o Rubella immune status and antibody tit er measurement, unless previously documented o Serological tests for syphilis o Hepatitis B surface antigen screen o Complete blood count, includi ng indices and platelets o Baseline liver function test o Baseline renal function test Other initial laboratory tests for all wome n that include, but are not limited to: o Cervical cytology (pap smear), unless the pr ovider has results of a test performed within the last 3 months o Cervical culture for gonorrhea (optiona l culture for rectal and pharyngeal) o Chlamydia screen Hemoglobin electrophoresis as indicated Urine drug and/or blood screening (the sele ction of drugs for sc reening will vary by community and should be based on current local prevalence data). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) educat ion and counseling. O ffer antibody testing, with pre- and posttest counseling. Always obtain written informed consent that is consistent with the laws a nd regulations of the locale. Purified protein derivative of tuberculin ( PPD) with antigen panel. If previously PPD- positive, a chest X-ray is recommended. Baseline sonogram. Level I scanning should be performed at a minimum to assess gestational age. Level II is recommended, es pecially when the gestational age is more than 18 weeks. 6Obtain optional tests . The benefit-to-cost ratio of these tests at the initial prenatal visit may vary depending on the population: Screening for human T-cell lymphotropic viru s (HTLV)-I and hepatitis C; such screening is recommended, particularly in areas of high seroprevalence Diabetic screening as indicated Complete urine analysis with screening for infection Group B streptococcal (GBS) carriage cultures (rectal and introital) Maternal serum-alpha fetal pr otein (MS-AFP) as indicated (16 to 20 weeks gestation) Toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, and he rpes screening tests as indicated Electrocardiogram (EKG) as indicated 7Address areas of special concern . In the physical examination of pregnant, substance-using women, the following areas n eed special attention: Dermatologic: Presence of infections, abscesse icterus, tattoos, bruisi ng (as of Dental: exis tence gns of interstitial pulmonary disease Cardiovascular: Rate and rhythm abnormalities, presence of murmurs Gastrointestinal: Presence of hepatomegaly, scars from injuries, incisional or umbilical hernias Genitourinary: us, including size conf iguration, fetal position, fetal heart rate, and fetal activity Breast: Nipples, evidence of trauma, \"lumps or bumps,\" breast vein used for injection Musculoskeletal: Evidence of pitting edema, distortion of muscular landmarks due to subcutaneous abscesses, or brawny edema Lymphatic: Presence of lym phadenopathy and abscesses 8Address medical complications . Complications encountered in pregnancy that require special attention include Anemia Bacteremia/septicemia Cardiac disease, especially endocarditis Cellulitis Poor dental hygiene Edema Hepatitis, acute and chronic HIV infection Phlebitis Pneumonia Tetanus Tuberculosis Urinary tract infection, including cys titis, urethritis, and other vulvovaginitides 9Provide referrals for all women that include Nutritional counseling Alcohol and other drug counseling Social services, including case management and possible home visitation Early intervention, includ ing parenting education Educational and employment counseling 10Provide additional referrals, as indicated by th e individual needs of the woman, that may include Genetic counseling Reproductive counseling and education about sterilization, cont raceptive methods, abortion, adoption, and foster care planni ng. Explore the patient's knowledge of and feelings about the use of contraceptives, in cluding cultural and religious issues and refusal and/or reluctance by the partner to use contraceptives. Childbirth and/or parenti ng classes as indicated Smoking cessation programs Mental health evaluation to rule out dual diagnosis (see Guideline 7 -Mental Health Considerations ) Testing for mental capacity to rule out ment al impairment due to alcohol and other drug use by the patient's mother Evaluation at infectious disease clinics for women who are HIV-infected. If they meet non-pregnant criteria for treatmen t with antivirals or prophylax is, consideration should be given to initiating such treatment after car eful discussion with the woman of known and unknown risks and benefits. Guideline 9\u2014Prenatal Followup Prenatal Followup Care for Pregnant, Substance Using Women 1 Visits to identify and address medical and psychosocial problems, as well as health education considerations 2 Random urine and/or blood toxicologies 3 Encouragement to continue treatment and es tablish ongoing relationships with other service providers 4 Written release from the patient to enable service providers to exchange information 5 Discussion of reproductive options 6 Management of common complications 7 Encouragement to involve the father of th e baby and other persons the woman considers significant, where appropriate Prenatal Followup Guidelines 1 Schedule visits to identify me dical and psychosocial problems, as well as health education considerations. Prenatal followup visits should be determined by the woman's individual needs and risk assessment. Recognizing that the majori ty of substance-using women have high-risk pregnancies, it is desirable to see them every 2 to 3 weeks, up until 28 weeks, then weekly thereafter. It may not be necessary for all contac ts to be with a physician; some contacts may be handled by a nurse or by the case manager. In so me instances, a woman should be seen weekly throughout her pregnancy, particular ly if she is not enrolled in a therapeutic alcohol and other drug treatment program. A woman with active me dical or obstetric problems should be seen more frequently, at intervals to be determined by the nature and seve rity of her problems. Up to 28 weeks Up to 28 weeks, the following should be done at each visit: Measure weight and blood pressu re; obtain urine dipstick for sugar, protein and ketones; test for nitrites and leukocyte esterase; obtain urine and/or bl ood toxicologies in accordance with the guidelines of the program. Assess for evidence of edema, abdominal pa in, abnormal vaginal discharge, bleeding, headache, visual disturbances, nausea, vom iting, signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection, uterine contractions, preg nancy-induced hypertension, and common discomforts. Perform abdominal examination. Review the chart to compare week s by date and weeks by examination. Auscultate fetal heart tones. Obtain sonograms as needed. Repeat blood work as needed. Provide for health educati on about the signs and symp toms of pregnancy, sexual intercourse, breast feeding, preterm labor pr ecautions, common complaints of pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting. From 28 to 34 weeks From 28 to 34 weeks, in addition to the above, the following should be do ne when appropriate: Obtain diabetes screen. Administer RhoGAM , if indicated. Repeat blood work as needed (syphilis, complete blood count [CBC], antibody screen, repeat screens for gonorrhea and chlamydia, and HBsAg if initially negative). Repeat sonogram for growth or detection of other abnormalities. Initiate preterm labor precautions. Provide for antepartum testing, if indicated. Provide for health education and parenti ng considerations, including preterm labor precautions and early infant care. From 35 weeks on From 35 weeks on, the following sh ould be done at each visit Repeat blood work as needed. Provide for antepartum feta l monitoring, if indicated. 2Obtain random urine and/or blood toxicologies . The purposes of these screens are to Establish the extent of recent alcohol and other drug use. Identify alcohol and other drug use and th e need for early preventive interventions. Identify crises or coping difficulties in the woman. For additional information and guidance, see Guideline 15 -- Urine Toxicology Considerations . 3 Encourage treatment and ongoing relationshi ps with other service providers, including the patient's therapeutic alcohol and ot her drug program or support groups. Some patients need education and support to ready them for pa rticipation in a treatment program or support group, and to prepare them for change. Provide di rect support or referr al for pre-treatment intervention. If a patient is already involved in an alcohol and other dr ug treatment program or support group, establish a relations hip with that provider after written informed consent is obtained from the patient. Methadone maintenance : Methadone maintenance has proved effective in the treatment of pregnant, opioid-dependent women. Participation in an alcohol and other drug treatment program is also important for thos e women using and abusing other drugs, such as alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, benzodi azepines, cannabinoids, barbiturates, and hallucinogens. Service provider communication : It is important that the alcohol and other drug treatment provider and the prenatal health care provider have access to information about the progress of treatment in both disciplines. 4Obtain written release of information to enable service providers to exchange information . Release forms, giving permission for th e exchange of infor- mation, must be signed by the patient in accordance with Federa l confidentiality laws and regulations (see Chapter 3 -- Legal and Ethical Guidelines for the Care of Pre gnant, Substance-Using Women ). Multidisciplinary case conferences and communication between disciplines are essential. Meetings of the prenatal care pr ovider, alcohol and other drug c ounselor, child protective service worker, probation officer, case manager, outreach worker, and social worker can help facilitate optimal prenatal care for the patient. 5Conduct an initial discussion of reproductive options . Beginning in the prenatal period, ethnically and culturally sensitiv e education on birth control a nd family planning should be provided and emphasized. Several routine methods of birth control are no t optimal choices for the woman who uses alcohol and other drugs. An individual evaluation is required to determine the best methods for each patient. Condoms can be used in combination with other methods for birth control and for prevention of sexually tr ansmitted diseases. Termination of pregnancy, adoption, and foster care are other options. Oral estrogen-progestin (contraceptive pill) : Oral estrogen-proges tin, preferably given in low doses, should be prescribed with car e, as many substance- using women have vascular disease secondary to prolonged abuse of alcohol and other drugs. They also may not be conscientious in taking pres cribed medication as indicated. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) : These devices may be considered only if the patient's past history does not include pelvic infections. An additional complication with IUDs is the possibility of exposure to sexually transmitted diseases. Barriers : Barrier-type contraceptive methods, wh ile the safest medically, are not the most effective and require consistent use. These methods include condoms -- which also reduce the risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases -- and diaphragms. Subcutaneous implants : Norplant is an example of a long-acting, reversible contraceptive method. Sterilization : Permanent sterilization may be intr oduced as an option. The procedure can be completed before discharge postpartum. The need for appropriate family planning must be stressed, because an unwanted pregnancy may add unnecessary anxiety to an already precarious situation. Counseling should be readily available and, at the discretion of the mo ther, should include significant others. 6Manage common complications . Some prenatal complicati ons are sufficiently common among substance-using women to warrant specif ic comment. These complications include preterm labor, intrauterine growth retardation, hepatitis B, and HIV. Preterm labor (PTL) Substance-using women are at risk to deliv er prematurely. Pertinent risk factors for preterm delivery, aside from the use of alc ohol and other drugs, include preterm and premature rupture of membranes, placental abruption, and stress. Due to the anesthetic/analgesic properties of most drugs of abuse, the patient may not perceive the early signs and symptoms of pr eterm labor and present too late to benefit from tocolytic therapy. Due to late initiation of prenatal care, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish true PTL from labor at term with a growth-retarded fetus. Recommendations: 1. Substance-using patients should be educated about their increased risk for preterm labor. Preterm labor precautions should be reviewed at each prenatal visit, especially between the 26th and 36th week. These patients often confuse symptoms of PTL with those of drug withdrawal. 2. Screen for and treat infections that predispos e to PTL, such as gonococcal or chlamydial infections. 3. Some patients may benefit from serial cervi cal exams and/or antepartum fetal heart rate/uterine activity testing to rule out PTL, es pecially if they have a multiple gestation or a previous history of PTL or preterm delivery (PTD). 4. A complete history of alcohol and other drug use and a ur ine and/or blood toxicology screen should be obtained on any patient pr esenting in PTL and/or with preterm and premature rupture of membranes. 5. Betamimetic tocolytics, such as ritodrine or terbutaline, should be used with great caution in stimulant-abusing patients. Alternative to colytic agents, such as magnesium sulfate, may be preferable.22 6. Assessment of fetal lung maturity may be helpful in distinguishing between PTL and labor at term with a growth-retarded fetus. Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) The pregnancies of some substance-using women are complicated by IUGR. Pertinent risk factors for IUGR, aside from the syne rgistic effects of pol ydrug abuse, include congenital infections, congenital anomalie s, multiple gestation, and poor nutrition. Since many of these patients present for pren atal care late in pr egnancy, it is often difficult to distinguish between IUGR and poor estimation of dates. Fo r this reason, serial scans for growth and weekly ante- partum fetal surveillance are often necessary. Recommendations: 1. A complete history of alcohol and other drug use, and perhaps a random urine and/or blood toxicology screen, should be obtained on all patients with suspected or proven IUGR. 2. A complete nutritional assessment should be obtained on all these patients (see Guideline 16 -- Nutritional Considerations ). 3. Screen for common congenital infections, in cluding syphilis, hu man immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and toxoplasmosis, as indicated. 4. A baseline sonogram and at least one followup scan 3 to 6 weeks later are recommended for all substance-using women. These procedures will rule out multiple gestation and major congenital anomalies, and document feta l growth. A level II-III scan for anomalies is helpful for all patien ts with documented IUGR. 5. Additional scans for growth and biweekly an tepartum fetal surveillance (Non-Stress Test [NST] with Amniotic Fluid Index [AFI] or biophysical profile) are recommended for those patients with suspected or proven IUGR. Hepatitis B Studies indicate that some subs tance-using women are chronic ca rriers of hepatitis B (HBsAg- positive). Recommendations: 1. Universal screening for HBsAg is recommende d for all pregnant women at the time of their first prenatal visit. 2. In order to prevent the perinatal transmissi on of hepatitis B virus (HBV) to the newborn, HBV immunization of the baby must be initiated within 2 hours of delivery (hepatitis B immune globulin [HBIG] plus hepatitis B vacc ine), with additional doses of vaccine at 1 and 6 months of age. 3. Due to the high prevalence of hepatitis B carriage among substance-using women, a history of current alcohol a nd other drug use by a patient pr esenting for delivery without results of HBsAg (i.e., if she had no prenat al care) necessitates initiation of the HBV immunization guidelines while awaiting results of HBsA g drawn at the time of admission. 4. Children and significant others of HBsAg-pos itive, substance-using women should also be assessed for hepatitis B carriage and v accinated if they are HBsAg/HBsAb-negative. 5. Substance-using women who are HBsAg/HB sAb- negative are candidates for HBV immunization. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection See Guideline 13 -- Obstetrical Care for HIV-Infected Women . 7Encourage involvement of the father of the baby and other persons the woman considers significant . Involving persons whom the woman considers significant in her life can foster added trust in the program and facilitate discussion about reproductive choices. Their involvement can also provide insight into supports for and barriers to her sobriety. Guideline 10\u2014Labor and Delivery for Women Who Have Received Prenatal Care Procedures To Be Done During Labor and Delivery Ideally, substance-using women have received prenatal care at some stage of their pregnancies. Procedures that are appropriate for thei r care during labor and delivery include 1 Detailed history, including re cent alcohol and othe r drug use, and comprehensive physical examination 2 Repeat hepatitis B surface antigen and HIV scr eens, unless previously known to be positive, and repeat serological te st for syphilis (titer if previously positive) 3 Complete urine and/or blood toxicology screen 4 Notification of pediatric and nur sing staff providing primary care 5 Notification of social services 6 Fetal monitoring as indicated 7 Pain management as appropriate 8 Selection of the delivery method 9 Insertion of a central line for injection drug users, if necessary 10 Observance of universal precautions fo r blood and body fluids and OSHA standards Labor and Delivery Guidelines 1 Obtain a detailed history, including recent alcohol and other drug use, and conduct a comprehensive physical examination. The end of pregnancy is a period when women may relapse into previous substance- using behavior . Therefore, on admission to the labor room, a complete history and physical examination are ne eded. Information about alcohol and other drug use is important, as follows: Substance-using women often confuse the early signs of labor with signs of withdrawal, and they may medicate themselves during the early hours of labor. Substance-using women should be urged to admit all alcohol and other drugs taken recently. Once known, the effects of these dr ugs on the woman and her in- fant, and possible interactions with any medications used in labor, can be ascertained and the appropriate staff alerted. The use of alcohol or other drugs prior to ar rival at the hospital can determine the type and amount of analgesic, if any, to be used during labor and delivery. 2 Repeat hepatitis B surface antigen and HIV scr eens, unless previously known to be positive, and repeat serological test for s yphilis (titer if previously posi tive). Repeat these tests, with appropriate consents, to determine if there is any change from the previous tests, and to establish the present status of the wo man and the fetus or neonate. 3 Obtain complete urine and/or blood toxicology screen. Substance-using women often arrive at the hospital with a high le vel of drugs in the blood due to recent use (see Guideline 15 -- Urine Toxicology Considerations ). 4 Notify pediatric and nursing staff providing primar y care. Advise staff of the patient's history of alcohol and other drug use, positive drug sc reening, and other pertinent medical conditions (e.g., results of hepatitis screen, serological test, and HIV test). 5 Notify social services. Advise staff of the patie nt's history of alcohol and other drug use and of any pertinent psychosocial concerns , such as unsafe living conditions. 6 Monitor the fetus as indicated. The greater likelihood of relapse at the time of labor increases the possibility of fetal stress and distress. 7 Provide pain management as appropriate. Anal gesia and anesthesia administered during labor may include the same range of options available to all patients. Pain medication and attempts at adequate pain relief should never be withheld s imply because the patient has a history of alcohol and other drug use. Regional anesthesia may be the procedure of choice. Analgesia and anesthesia administered dur ing delivery may include Regional: Epidural or spinal Pudendal or local The following statements also pertain: Due to tolerance, patients may require higher than usual doses of short-acting intramuscular/injection narcotics. Avoid use of combination narcotic agonis t/ antagonists and pure narcotic antagonists because they may precipita te acute drug withdrawal. Methadone provides minimal analgesi a for those women using opioids. 8 Select the delivery method depende nt only on obstetrical indications. 9 Insert a central line if necessa ry. Because of the presence of sclerotic veins, many injection drug users require the inse rtion of a central line. 10 Follow universal precautions for blood and body fluids and OSHA sta ndards that include Gowns, masks, eye protection, and double gloves for deliveries Gloves for invasive procedures, changing so iled linens or dressings, handling the placenta and cord, and handling the neonate prior to the first bath Mechanical or bulb aspiration of the newbor n: Avoid mouth-operated aspiration traps. Guideline 11\u2014Labor and Delivery for Women With No Prenatal Care Procedures To Be Done During Labor and Delivery Many substance-using women receive no prenatal care and are first seen by a health care provider during labor and deliver y. Moreover, some women are in advanced labor or deliver prior to entering the hospital. Procedures for the care of these women include the following: 1 Detailed history, includi ng alcohol and other drug use, and comprehensive physical examination 2 Complete baseline laboratory tests 3 Complete urine and/or blood toxicology screen 4 Sonogram for dating and to rule out multiple gestation 5 Notification of pediatric and nur sing staff providing primary care 6 Notification of social services 7 Fetal monitoring as indicated 8 Pain management as appropriate 9 Selection of the delivery method 10 Insertion of a central line for injection drug users, if necessary 11 Observance of universal precautions fo r blood and body fluids and OSHA standards Labor and Delivery Guidelines 1Obtain a detailed history and conduct a comprehensive physical examination , although circumstances may impede these activiti es prior to delivery, that includes A complete medical, surgical, reproductive, and alcohol and ot her drug use history An appropriate family histor y, with special emphasis on al cohol and other drug use and mental illness Information about the baby's father, includi ng alcohol and other drug use and medical history 2Obtain complete baseline laboratory data that include Blood group, Rh factor determination, and antibody screen Rubella immune status Serologic test for syphilis Hepatitis B surface antigen screen Liver function tests Renal function tests Complete blood count with in dices and platelet count Complete urinalysis and ur ine screen for bacteriuria HIV counseling should be provide d in the postpartum period and testing should be encouraged. If the patient is seen early in labor, it may be technically feasible to obtain a Pap smear, GC culture, and chlamydia screen. Do a PPD, preferab ly with an antigen panel unless previously positive, in which case a chest radiograph is needed. 3 Obtain a urine toxicology screen, with or without blood alcohol leve l, as indicated (see Guideline 15 -- Urine Toxicology Considerations ). 4Obtain a sonogram . In order to decide about optimal delivery management, it is helpful to obtain a sonogram on intake prior to delivery. This procedure will provide information about approximate gestational age, estimated fetal we ight (EFW), and presen tation, and can rule out multiple gestation and major con- genital anomalies. 5Notify pediatric and nursery staff of the patient's history of alcohol and other drug use and other pertinent medical conditions. 6Notify social services so that a psychosocial assessment is completed after delivery. Because of confusion and fear, some substance-using women ab andon their infants at the hospital rather than discuss various options for the infant's care a nd legal custody. Assignment of a case manager is essential for the patient and her newborn to ensure followup medical care, initiate alcohol and other drug treatment, and provide access to social services. 7Monitor the fetus as indicated . The greater likelihood of relapse at the tim e of labor increases the possibility of fetal stress and distress. 8Provide pain management . Follow the pain management procedures presented in Guideline 10 -- Labor and Delivery for Women Who Have Received Prenatal Care . 9Select the method of delivery dependent only on obstetrical indications. 10Insert a central line if necessary . Because of the presence of sclerotic veins, many injection drug users require the inse rtion of a central line. 11 Follow universal precautions for blood a nd body fluids and OSHA standards that include Gowns, masks, eye protection, and double gloves for deliveries Gloves for invasive procedures, changing so iled linens or dressings, handling the placenta and cord, and handling the neonate prior to the first bath Mechanical or bulb aspiration of the newbor n: Avoid mouth-operated aspiration traps. Guideline 12\u2014Postpartum Care Procedures for the Postpartum Care of Substance Using Women 1 Continuation of or enrollment in an al cohol and other drug treatment program 2 Use of an appropriate family planning method 3 Breastfeeding in methadone-maintained patients 4 Prevention and health maintenance efforts for the mother and infant 5 Child care and parenting education 6 Postpartum followup Guidelines for Postpartum Care 1Encourage continuation of or enrollment in an alcohol and other drug treatment program . The supportive involvement of the patient's significant others in her treatment should be encouraged. This involvement can be extremely important in the treatment of addiction and in positively influencing the environment in which the newborn will be raised. 2Encourage use of an appropriate family planning method . For further information, refer to the discussion of Preconception Counseling in the introduction to Chapter 1 , Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Guidelines for Pregnant, Substance-Using Women . 3 Permit breastfeeding in meth adone-maintained patient s. A number of substance-using women express a desire to breastfeed their infa nts. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated in a methadone-maintained patient if she is known to be free of other drug use and is known to be HIV-seronegative. If the mother is abusing multiple drugs that would expose the infant to diverse agents in varying levels, then breastfeeding ma y still be contraindicated. Breastfeeding is not recommended if the mother is HIV-infected. 4Initiate prevention and health maintenance efforts . The woman should be encouraged to start a preventive health maintenance program. This program should provi de for immunizations and yearly checkups, including Pap smears and mammograms. For the infant, appropriate pediatric followup and referral to early intervention programs should be arranged. 5Provide child care and parenting education . Information should be provided on infant feeding, bathing, umbilical cord care, breastfeedi ng, appropriate approaches for \"fussy\" infants, and for other siblings. 6Provide postpartum followup . The health care provider should meet with the woman 2 to 6 weeks after delivery to accomplish the following: Review the laboratory data. Review the care plan, incl uding parenting education. Discuss the delivery and the well-being of the infant. Conduct a physical examination. Look for current alcohol and othe r drug use and perform screening. Encourage use of an appropria te family planning method. Guideline 13\u2014Obstetrical Care for HIV-Infected Women Procedures To Be Done With HIVInfected Women 1 Initial workup 2 Medical treatment for HIV-related conditions 3 Obstetric management Obstetrical Care Guidelines for HIV\u00adInfected Women 23 1Complete an initial workup . The initial workup should include a complete medical history, complete review of symptoms, comprehensive physical examination, a nd additional laboratory screening. a) Complete medical history, with special attention to Sexual practices (sexual partners and their HI V status, practice of anal and oral sex, exchange of sex for money and drugs) Alcohol and other drug abuse (inj ection drug use, use of shared needles, drugs of choice, and sexual or drug partners' history of alcohol and other drug abuse) Blood transfusions, including dates and locations Tuberculosis (TB) exposure, past PPDs, and Vaginal candidiasis Cervical dysplasia b) Complete review of symptoms that includes Rashes, bruising, bleeding Fever, chills, night sweats Fatigue, exercise intole rance, dyspnea, cough Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, odynophagia, diarrhea Vaginal discharge, dysuria, abdominal pain Headache, visual changes, memory lo ss, depression, paresthesia, weakness Weight loss and/or poor weight gain prior to and during pregnancy c) Comprehensive physical examination that includes: Vital signs: Temperature, weight , blood pressure, -- rare in women) its, cranial defects, sensory or motor changes, weakness (HIV, toxoplasma, cryptococcus) d) Additional laboratory screening that includes HIV culture and antigen assay where available CBC, differential, platelets Immunological status assessmen t, e.g., CD- counts Serological tests for syphilis, GC, chla mydia-repeat screening as indicated PPD with antigen panel Possible freezing of serum sample for later testing of titers for toxoplasma, CMV, and cryptococcus 2Provide medical treatment for HIV-related conditions . Medical treatment should be provided in consultation with HI V specialists and consistent with current recommendations. Women with CD4 counts of less than 200mm3 should be placed on an antiviral agent and given appropriate prophylaxis.24 Aggressively evaluate and promp tly treat any conditions diagnosed. If laboratory studies indicat e significant immuno-suppres sion, consider prophylactic treatment against opportunistic infections. Consider the use of an anti- viral agent (zidovudine [AZT]). Consider other experimental treatment guide lines and refer the patient as indicated. 3Provide obstetric management . Obstetric management should include all of the usual obstetric practices, with special attention to the following: a) Antepartum care Provide close prenatal followup. Obtain interim history and conduct a physic al examination to include HIV-related elements. Repeat serological tests for syphilis, GC, chlamydia, and other laboratory tests as clinically indicated. Assess immunological status ever y trimester, or more often if the patient develops an illness or if a declining trend is noted. Perform a fetal assessment if clinically indi cated. To prevent possible HIV transmission and nosocomial infection, avoid invasive procedur es if possible, but no t at the expense of accepted standards of care (e.g., genetic amniocentesis). Discuss with the patient the need to share pertinent medical information with her other direct care providers an d those of her infant. Ensure primary care and sp ecialized pediatric followup. Ensure involvement in an alcohol and other drug treatment program. Reinforce the need to practice safer sex. Recommend involvement in an HIV/AIDS support group. b) Intrapartum care Follow universal precautions for blood and body fluids and OSHA standards that include o Gowns, masks, eye protection, and double gloves for deliveries o Gloves for invasive procedures, changing so iled linens or dressings, handling the placenta and cord, and handling the neonate prior to the first bath o Mechanical or bulb aspiration of the ne wborn: Avoid mouth-operated aspiration traps Utilize fetal monito ring as indicated. There is no specific indication for Caesarean delivery. c) Postpartum care Breastfeeding is not recommended; otherw ise, encourage mo ther-infant bonding. Ensure comprehensive medical followup for the woman, infant, and family members as indicated. Educate the woman to care for the infant's special needs. Ensure followup in an alcohol and other drug treatment program. Encourage use of an appropria te family planning method. Guideline 14\u2014Drug-Exposed Neonates 25 Effects on the Neonate From Maternal Use of Heroin, Methadone, and Cocaine The following guidelines pertain to three substances that have a great impact on the health of infants -- heroin, methadone, and cocaine. Rapid recognition, careful assessment, and appropriate treatment of abstinence symptoms in infants expose d in utero to one or more of these substances will contribute to a satisfactory initial and long-term outcome for these neonates. Programs dealing directly with drug-exposed ne onates will find more detailed information on assessment and treatment in a protocol being developed by the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment. This detailed guideline is titled Drug-Exposed Infants Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) Neonatal Effects of Heroin The effects of heroin on the neonate may include the following: 1Low birth weight. The low birth weight is due primarily to symmetric intrauterine growth retardation. In addition, lo w birth weight may be s econdary to prematurity. 2Meconium aspiration. Meconium aspiration may be cau sed by hypoxia in association with antepartum or intrapartum passage of meconium secondary to fetal stress. 3Sexually transmitted diseases. Maternal lifestyle issues pred ispose the infant to congenital syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatit and HIV infection. 4Neonatal abstinence syndrome. Neonatal ab-stinence syndrome occurs in about 60 to 80 percent of heroin-exposed infants. Its onset is usually within 72 hours of birth, with a high mortality if the syndrome is severe and untreated. Premature infants have been reported to show a less severe abstinence syndrom e following opiate exposure. The syndrome involves the central and autonomic ne rvous systems, gastrointestinal system, and pul- monary (CNS) signs include ir ritability, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, abnormal suck, and poor feeding. Seizur es are seen in 1 to 3 per- cent of infants. Gastrointestinal signs include diarrhea and vomiting. Respirat ory signs include tachypnea, hyperpnea, and respiratory alka losis. signs includ e sneezing, yawning, lacrimation, sweating, and hyperpyrexia. If the infant is hypermetabolic, the postnatal weight loss may be excessive and subsequent weight gain suboptimal. 5Delayed effects. Delayed effects include subacute w ithdrawal with symptoms such as restlessness, agitati on, irritability, and poor so cialization that may pers ist for 4 to 6 months. There is an increased incidence of Sudden In fant Death Syndrome (S IDS). Behavioral and developmental consequences, such as hyperactiv ity and poor school performance, have been inconsistently reported. Studies on these beha vioral and developmental consequences are difficult to interpret because of poor long-term followup and inability to control for postnatal environmental influences. 6No effect. It is important to understand that many infants will show no adverse effects from maternal use of heroin. Many women will know this , based on their own experience or that of other women. Providers should acknowledge this reality so that women will not use this knowledge to discount their advice. Treatment for Neonatal Effects of Heroin Neonatal abstinence syndrome is best treated with a substitute opioid such as paregoric or with a CNS depressant such as phenobarbital. Neonatal Effects of Methadone The effects of methadone on the neonate may include: 1Abstinence syndrome. The neonate suffers an abstinence syndrome similar to that seen with heroin. The abstinence syndrome fo r methadone usually starts la ter and lasts longer (due to longer half life) than for heroin. Centra l nervous system signs are prominent. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) are abnormal in about 50 percent of the infants. Seizures occur in about 7 percent of the infants, tend to occur be tween days 7 and 14, and are primarily myoclonic. Abstinence is more variable in onset and course than with heroin. Exposure to both heroin and methadone may produce a biphasic or atypical pattern of withdrawal. 2Fetal growth and reduced perinatal mortality. Multiple risk factors may contribute to poor fetal growth in methadone-exposed children. Although birth weight and head size may be reduced, fetal growth is generally more normal than with heroin, and may be related to the first trimester dosage of methadone. Reduced perinata l mortality compared with heroin use may be due to positive changes in lifestyle , including increased prenatal care. 3Postnatal effects. The postnatal weight change pattern may be suboptimal if the infant is hypermetabolic. A thrombocytosis may develop duri ng the second week of lif e and peak at about the eighth week before returning to normal. Ther e is biochemical evidence of hyperthyroidism in some infants. 4Breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is encouraged if the wo man is HIV-seronegative and not abusing other drugs. 5Delayed effects. Delayed effects may include an incr eased incidence of SIDS. Long-term followup studies are incomplete and difficult to interpret. Generally, infants have performed within the normal range and no major neurologic or developmental disabilities have been reported. 6No effect. Treatment for Neonatal Effects of Methadone Treatment with either paregoric or phenobarbital is effective. Neonatal Effects of Cocaine The effects of cocaine on the neonate may include the following: 1Effects at birth. Generally, lower birth weights, head circumferences, and increased rates of prematurity have been repor ted compared to controls. 2No abstinence syndrome. There is no clinically documente d neonatal abstin ence syndrome for cocaine as is seen with the opioids. 3Neonatal dysfunction. Neonatal CNS dysfunction includes transient irritability, abnormal sleeping patterns, tremors, hypertonia, and lability of state. One study has reported that about 50 percent of the infants have abnormal EEGs in the neonatal period with reversion to normal within the first few months of life. Infrequent cerebral infarctions a nd seizures have been reported. Electroencephalographic abnormalities have been reported inconsistently. In addition, information on congenital malformation has been inconclusive. 4Breastfeeding. Most drugs pass through breast milk. The amount of cocaine that passes to the infant in the breast milk reinfo rces the neurotoxic syndrome. 5Delayed effects. Only preliminary long-term followup st udies have been reported. A number of studies have suggested that inci dence of SIDS is increased. 6No effect. It is important to understand that many infants will show no adverse effects from maternal use of cocaine. Many women will know this based on their own experience or that of other women. Providers should acknowledge this reality so that women will not use this knowledge to discount their advice. Treatment for Neonatal Effects of Cocaine If treatment is indicated, a s hort course of phenobarbital is recommended. Use of the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale26 is encouraged. Guideline 15\u2014Urine Toxicology Considerations27 Considerations for Urine Toxicology 1 Specific urine toxicology techniques 2 Factors contributing to false-negative and false-positive test results 3 Approximate duration that drugs can be detected in urine 4 Alternate methods of screening for drug abuse Use of Urine Toxicology Urine toxicologies are recommended for pre gnant women in order to provide optimal, comprehensive medical care and alcohol and othe r drug treatment. They are, however, only an adjunct to good history-taking. Th e use of urine toxicology can re duce morbidity that may result from misdiagnosis and the subsequent use of in appropriate medications, such as betamimetic tocolytics for premature labor. The particular dr ugs for which a patient should be screened will depend on the specific geographic location and the substances most prevalent in that area. Specific State laws may dictate approaches to the use of urine toxicologies . Test results in some States and localities are used for other than me dical purposes and may have legal implications (see Chapter 3 -- Legal and Ethical Guidelines for th e Care of Pregnant, Substance-Using Women ). A toxicology test that is positive for drugs and/or alcohol -- whether it is a \"true\" positive or a \"false\" positive -- may have extremely negative e ffects on women, such as criminal detention or possible loss of child custody. B ecause of this, the following guidelines recommend that urine drug testing be done only in cases where it is absolutely necessar y. Since current urine toxicology techniques vary in thei r specificity (the extent to which they produce false-positive results), the Consensus Panel recommends that th e alcohol and other drug abuse field adopt the standards used for urine drug testing in the workplace. These standards are contained in Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs , published in the Federal Register on April 11, 1988. Training in these new tests and proce dures should be conducted for all pertinent personnel. Issues of Informed Consent Important issues related to urin e toxicology include the need to uphold the civil rights of the patient and to ensure that there is informed consent for the procedure. Testing a woman for illegal drugs in the absence of medical indications may be disc riminatory, violate the woman's civil rights, and constitu te an unlawful search and seizure. The woman has the right, whenever possible, to be informed of th e risks, potential ramifications, and benefits of urine toxicology testing. There may be times when informed consent cannot be obtained because of medical considerations. If urine is being tested for fo rensic rather than medi cal reasons, a separate consent should be obtained. Before testing neon ates, informed consent should be obtained from the mother. Successful treatment for alcohol and other drug abuse depends on a positive therapeutic relationship between the patient and her caregive rs. Informed consent helps foster and is an integral part of a trusting and cooperative therapeutic relationship. Urine testing is just one of a variety of ways of identifying a woman who is in need of treatment services. Urine toxicology should never be the only reason for pr oviding these servi ces to a woman. Indications for Screening of Pregnant Women Caregivers should ask questions re garding the use of alcohol, othe r drugs, and medications as a routine part of any medical hist ory. Every effort should be made to identify which drugs are used; the frequency, pattern, and duration of use; la st dosage; and the routes of administration. It should be made clear to the patient that this information is necessary for proper medical management of the following: Potential withdrawal, medical withdrawal , education, and alcohol and other drug treatment Physical manifestations attributab le to alcohol and other drug use Potential interactions with other drug s or medications that may be given Fetal and neonatal effects A urine and/or blood toxicology screen is necess ary only in those circumstances where a history of drug use cannot be reliably obtai ned, as when a patient is comatose or confused, or when a discrepancy exists between the clinical findings and the drug thought to have been ingested. Caregivers should obtain informed consent and follow a closely monitored specimen collection procedure and chain of custody. Reports indicate that a pregnant woman's race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status have an overwhelming impact on whether or not she is screened. The following are indications used by some programs to screen a pr egnant woman for drug use: History of alcohol and other drug use Loss of custody of other children No prenatal care Altered mental state (e.g., incoherent , unconscious, lethargic, combative) Preterm delivery; preterm labor; preter m, Third trimester vaginal bleeding (e.g., placental abruption) Physical evidence of alcohol and other drug use (e.g., track marks) Signs and symptoms of in toxication or withdrawal A pregnant woman who is known to be using drugs, whether through self-report or positive toxicology, should be treated for the acute medical condition and referred for alcohol and other drug treatment. In addition, a positive history of drug use or urine toxi cology may suggest the need for a newborn toxicology screen, which may be ordered and obtained after delivery. In a newborn, a positive toxicology for nonprescribed drugs suggests that a social work evaluation be done. Testing Urine for Drugs 1Specific urine toxicology techniques. Drug tests are most comm only performed on urine, since most drugs and their breakdown products are ex creted in the urine in higher concentrations than in the blood. While alcohol can be detected in the urine, testi ng of blood or breath is more widely used. Screening tests: These are rapid, sensitive tests th at may be lacking somewhat in specificity (i.e., there may be false-positive re sults) and may require confirmatory testing. o Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC). TLC is a practical, economical, and sensitive method for detecting drugs in urine specime ns. Examples of drugs detectable with TLC and acid hydrolysis include heroin A variety of immunoassays and equipment are available to screen for drugs of abuse. Laboratories may use enzyme immunoassays (e.g., Enzyme highly specific tests (i.e ., false-positive results are rare when the tests are performed correctly). o Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometr y: GC/MS is an example of a confirmatory test that allows for quan titative analysis. Drugs detectable with GC/MS include opioids, amphetamines, co metabolites, and 2Factors contributing to false-positi ve and false-negative test results. How samples are collected and handled is critic al for avoiding false-positive a nd false-negative test results. Collecting samples: Improperly preparing the surfaces through which test materials are to be collected (e.g., using anesthetic lubricants for urinary catheters, cleansing skin with isopropyl alcohol) may cause false-positive results. Handling samples: Mislabeling, switching, and dilution of samples may occur prior to testing. Intermittent injections and diluted urine can resu lt in false-negative results. False-positive TLCs, although rare, may occur when spots of identical coloring and motility caused by different drugs are seen on the chromatograph. Legally prescrib ed cough medications may yield a positive TLC for morphine, since a portion of the codeine is transformed in to morphine in the body. In addition, both false-negative and false-positive re sults can occur from certain foods a woman might ingest (e.g., poppy seeds). If the patient has a bacterial urinary tract infe ction, a false-positive reaction with EMIT may occur with each test, indicating polydrug use. When there is an actual or potential urinary tract infection, the presence of lysoenzyme should be determined to rule out the possibi lity of a false- positive reaction. Finally, the expertis e of the testing laboratory may determine the reliability of the results. Even the best labora tories have a relatively high inci dence of nonreproducible results. 3Approximate duration that drugs can be detected in urine. The following table shows the approximate duration for detecting a number of drugs in the urine of non-pregnant adults. 28 Testing Urine for Drugs Amphetamines 48 hours Alcohol 12 hours Barbiturates 10 to 30 days Valium (Diazepam) 4 to 5 days Cocaine 24 to 72 hours Heroin (detected as Morphine) 24 hours Marijuana 3 to 30 days Methaqualone (Quaaludes) 4 to 24 days Phencyclidine (PCP) 3 to 10 days Methadone 3 days (depending on the dose) Elimination times differ in neonates and adults. The elimination of certain fat-bound substances is unpredictable and may be enhanced by maki ng the urine acidic. The length of time for detecting drugs in the urine depends to a great extent on dose and duration of use. 4Alternate methods of screening for drug use. Other methods of screening for prenatal use of drugs are not readily available and may not be acceptable in a court of law. They include Newborn meconium Radioimmunoassay of maternal hair Guideline 16\u2014Nutritional Considerations Considerations in Providing Nutritioin Services 1 Nutrition assessment services 2 Nutrition care plan 3 Nutrition counseling 4 Special areas of concern Possible Effects of Selected Substances on the Fetus Alcohol and other drug use is often associated w ith poor nutrition. This association can result in serious health consequences for pregnant, s ubstance-using women and their infants. Scarce financial resources and a lack of knowledge a bout the elements of good nutrition may further compound these effects. The following information de scribes the possible eff ects of maternal use of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, heroin, and co caine. It is possible that infants will show no adverse effects from maternal use of these or ot her drugs. The use of othe r drugs in addition to those listed below, as well as polydrug use, ma y also impact the heal th of women and their infants. There are clinical recommendations fo r improved nutrition and gu idelines for nutritional assessment and education. Cigarette Smoking Possible effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy. Decreased birth weight is the most consistently observed effect of maternal smoking on infants. This decrease in infant birth weight is on average 200 g. A recent review of the literatur e on the determinants of low birth weight has, like previous reviews, concluded that cigarette smoking is by far the single most important modifiable factor responsible for fetal gr owth retardation in developed countries. Possible nutrition-related effects of smoking. Cigarette smoking may affect maternal nutrition and, consequently, fetal nutrition, in two important ways: (1) the increased metabolic rate in smokers can lead to lower availability of calorie s; and, (2) the exposure to tobacco may increase iron requirements and decrease th e availability of certain nutrients such as vitamin B12, amino acids, vitamin C, folate, and zinc. In smokers, uteroplacental blood flow restricts nutrient and oxygen flow to the fetus. Alcohol Possible effects of excessive maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Alcohol is now recognized as a potent teratogen. Infants of mothers who consume excessive amounts of alcohol during pregnancy may suffer from Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Effects (see Guideline 3 -- Medical Withdrawal From Alcohol for more information). Possible nutrition-related effects of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption may be related to decreased dietary in take, impaired metabolism and absorption of nutrients, and altered nutrient activation and util ization. Interactions betw een alcohol and deficiencies of such nutrients as protein and zinc may also pl ay a role in the etio logy of alcohol-related effects on the fetus. Although there is no convincing evidence that nut ritional supplementation will counteract the adverse effects of alcohol, standard prenatal vitamins plus folate, B12, and iron supplementation should be prescribed. However, si nce alcohol abuse has clearly been shown to be detrimental to the fetus, nutritional supplement ation should not replace efforts to encourage women to limit or eliminate alcohol intake during pregnancy. Marijuana The marijuana of the 1990s is very different from the drug that was available in the 1960s. Today there is more THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) in marijuana because of plant hybridization. Possible effects of maternal marijuana use during pregnancy. Decreased birth weight and body length are the most commonly noted effects among infants of mothers who use marijuana during pregnancy. Possible nutrition-related effects of marijuana use. There are conflicting study results on the possible nutrition-related effects of marijuana use. Some studie s indicate weight gain by infants, other studies show less weight ga in, while still others show no difference between infants whose mothers used marijuana and infants whose mothers did not use the drug. Heroin Possible effects of maternal us e of heroin during pregnancy. Decreased birth weight, prematurity, and intrauterine growth retardati on are among the effects on the fetus of maternal heroin use during pregnancy. Medical complicati ons from the use of dirty needles may also ensue, such as abscesses, bacter ial endocarditis, a nd hepatitis (see Guideline 4 -- Opioid Stabilization for more information). Possible nutrition-related effects of heroin use. These effects include poor nourishment, with vitamin deficiencies, iron deficiency anemia, and folic acid deficiency anemia. Many of the effects on pregnancy and the fetus can be mitigat ed in a comprehensive methadone maintenance treatment program. Cocaine Possible effects of maternal us e of cocaine during pregnancy. Spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth retardati on, premature labor, and abruptio placentae are among the effects of maternal use of cocaine. Information on the c ongenital effects of maternal cocaine use are inconclusive (see Guideline 5 -- Cocaine Withdrawal for more information). Possible nutrition-related effects of cocaine use . As is true for marijuana, little is known about the nutrition-related effects of cocaine use. Cocaine 's vasoconstrictive ability may lead to fetal hypoxia and reduced nutritional supply to the fetus. Since cocaine, like amphetamines, acts as an appetite suppressant, an inadequate maternal diet may play a role in retarding growth in fetuses of cocaine abusers. Clinical Recommendations Prevention and intervention. The highest priority should be gi ven to efforts to prevent or stop alcohol and other drug use by pr egnant women. There is clear evidence that cigarette smoking and alcohol and other drug use adversely aff ect the health of the mother and fetus. Nutrition counseling and intervention. Since nutritional deficien cies can be expected, especially among heavy abusers of alcohol and other drugs, diet c ounseling, referral to a social worker, and other intervention strategies to improve food intake are recommended. Multivitamin-minera l supplementation. Because heavy abusers of alcohol and other drugs may have difficulty in taking the steps needed to improve their dietary intake, the use of multivitamin-mineral supplements is recommended. Nutritional Assessment and Education Guidelines More than 40 different nutrients are needed fo r good health. Essential nutrients are the amino acids from protein, vitamins, minerals, fatty acids, and calories obt ained from carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Since no singl e food supplies all these nutrients in the amounts needed, it is recommended that women eat a variety of nour ishing food daily. To plan meals and snacks, foods are divided into five groups: (1) vegetables; (2) fruits; (3) breads, ce reals, rice, and pasta; (4) milk, yogurt, cheese, and other dairy products; and (5) poultry, fish, le an meat, dry beans and peas, eggs, and nuts. The 1990 edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends the following: Eat a variety of foods Maintain healthy weight Choose a diet low in fat, sa turated fat, and cholesterol Choose a diet with plenty of vege tables, fruits, and grain products Use sugar only in moderation Use salt and sodium in moderation 1Provide nutrition assessment services for all patients to identify and assess for Nutritional high-risk status Probable food deficiencies Probable food excesses Interest in breastfeeding Eligibility and certification for food supplement programs such as Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) and Food Stamps. If the woma n has children, include school breakfast and lunch programs, summer feeding pr ograms, and child care food programs. Smoking status Lactose intolerance Underlying eating disorder. It is not uncommon for substance-abusing women to have an underlying eating disorder -- a possibility that needs to be considered as a woman stops using drugs and<%-9>/or alcohol. Appropriate referrals for additional counseling may be needed. 2Develop a nutrition care plan that describes the nature of th e diet and counseling needs of the patient. 3 Provide nutriti on counseling to Teach about the appropriate diet, taking into account the patient's cultural food patterns, access to food, and lifestyle. Teach management of the food budget and meal planning as needed. Explain the WIC Program and other federa lly funded food assist ance and nutrition programs. Provide nutrition education. Make referrals for smoking cessation counseling, as indicated. 4Address special areas of concern . All patients should receive instruction and assistance regarding the following: Poor diet pattern Encourage the patient to eat nutritious foods as snacks, since these provide an important source of nutrients for a woman wh o does not eat three meals a day. Educate the patient on nutritious snacks, wh ich may include, but are not limited to milk, cheese, yogurt, crackers, popcorn, fru it, carrot sticks, and leftover meat. Poor quality diet and eating problems Instruct the patient on recommended servings of each food group and reinforce healthy choices, including foods that are culturally accep table and are a part of the woman's diet. Recommend a decrease in \"empty-calorie\" (high in calories and lacking or low in essential nutrients) and high-fat foods. Recommend a decrease in or avoidance of stim ulants such as caffeine (e.g., coffee, tea, and chocolate). Underweight Assess the patient's attitude toward weight ga in and obtain a past a nd current history of eating disorders. Assess for tobacco intake and encourage the patient to decrease use. Encourage the patient to discontinue stimulants such as cocaine that inhibit weight gain. Assess the patient's appetite, looking for o Poor appetite as a result of stress. A patient may need to have major stress factors handled before her underweight stat us can be successfully resolved. o Poor appetite as a symptom of prot ein, calorie, vitamin B, or vitamin C deficiency. A multivitamin supplement should be provided. Make dietary recommenda tions that include o A basic diet. The basic diet should include at least all recommended servings from each of the five food groups. o Additions to the basic diet . Additional food from any of the five food groups should be added to the diet. o High-density foods. Nutritious, high-density foods should be added as part of the diet (e.g., pizza, cheese, peanut but ter, ice cream, and whole milk). o An eating schedule. The underweight patie nt should be encouraged to eat frequently throughout the day, with a goal of five to six feedings. Overweight Assess the patient's attitude a bout being overweight and discuss with the patient ways to o Follow the five food group plan of eating, dividing the plan into at least three meals and two snacks. o Increase intake of fresh fruits and vege tables, whole-grain cereals, and dried beans. o Eliminate or decrease inta ke of \"empty-calorie\" food. o Decrease fat intake. o Avoid fad diets. o Review the patient's family history of diabetes and her diabetes screen during pregnancy. o Encourage the patient to increase modera te exercise, such as walking and other non-weight-bearing forms of exercise. Increas ed exercise is at least as important as dietary changes in weight maintenance. o Discuss goals. For an overweight patien t, the goal is weight maintenance and minimal weight gain. Weight loss is discouraged. Periodic evaluation of urine ketones is a helpful monitoring method. o Follow up as necessary. Potential vitamin deficiency Assess the patient's methods of preparing f oods to uncover potential vitamin deficiencies caused by the preparation process. Determine the possible need for specific multivitamin supplements. Follow up as necessary. Footnotes 20.

This section focuses on urine toxicology because this is the most widely used method of screening for most drugs. However, the most wide ly used method of detecting alcohol is through testing the blood or breath, although urine can be used. In discussing alcohol, this protocol therefore refers to bl ood and breath testing. 28. Bean, X. Understanding t oxicology reports, table 5. Eden Center Training Material .

TIP 2: Chapter 3\u2014Legal and Ethical Guidelines for the Care of Pregnant, Substance-Using Women Overview Caring for pregnant, substance-using women and their infants can present complex legal and ethical issues concerning confiden- tiality, re porting, and the custody a nd protection of children. Service providers must understand and be prepared to address all aspects of these issues. To do so, they must be trained in the areas cove red by these guidelines. Th is training should be developed at the Federal level and include exampl es that illustrate the applicability of the guidelines in a variety of environments. The first level of training shoul d be provided by the Federal Govern ment to staff of State alcohol and other drug programs, maternal and child hea lth agencies, child welfare offices, and child protective services agencies. Once trained, these staff will be better prepared to evaluate and recommend improvements to programs serv ing pregnant, substa nce-using women. States, in turn, should offer training to local pr ogram staff. This training should inform service providers of new or clarified guidelines concerning the care of pregnant, substance-using women, and provide them with tools to use to document complianc e with the guidelines. An additional level of training should include th ose who interface with and are involved in the court process. Judges must be a priority target group for training, and attorneys, probation officers, and other court personnel should be encouraged to participate as well. Training at all levels must be ongoing and updated at regular inte rvals to ensure that current information is available. Cross-training of health care professionals, child welfare specialists, and judges and attorneys involved in family law is highly desirable. New training funds are needed from the Federal level to ensure compliance with these guidelines. Scope of the Guidelines The following guidelines address Federal and St ate confidentiality and reporting regulations, training in ethical and le gal issues, and protective services for children. The Consensus Panel believes that criminal pe nalties should not be imposed on women based solely on their use of alcohol and other drugs during pregnancy. In the event a substance-using woman is incarcerated or detained for a criminal offense, she should be given access to treatment services. Furthermore, pregnancy should never be the pretext for changing sentences given to women who commit crimes. Guideline 17\u2014Confidentiality and Reporting Jurisdictions may require that au thorities be notified when an infant is born drug dependent or when an infant is exposed to alcohol and ot her drugs at the time of birth. When patient information is involved, treatment programs must follow Federal laws and regulations concerning the confidentiality of dr ug and alcohol treatment records.29 State laws vary considerably, so overall nationa l guidelines concerning confiden tiality and the reporting of patient information are not possi ble. In circumstances where St ate laws are in conflict with Federal confidentiality regulations, the Federal regulat ions prevail. All staff of alcohol and other drug treatment pr ograms must be knowledgeab le about Federal and State laws concerning confiden tiality and patient records and how these laws affect their practices and the patients they serve. Treatment staff must be trained to understand and handle any conflicts between these laws and to recogniz e how such conflicts af fect the delivery of services in their particular co mmunities. Similarly, patients in alcohol and other drug treatment programs must be told about the extent of th e confidentiality protection provided by law, and when this protection does not exist. Impact of Confidentiality and Reporting Laws on Women State and local laws that require maternal alc ohol and other drug use and fetal drug exposure to be reported to authorities have a significant impact on women and their children. These reports can be the impetus to remove children from th eir mothers' care and have them placed in protective custody or foster care. Knowing that such a report is in the offing, some women may forego their prenatal care or the follow- up services they need. The closer communities move toward measures that detain pregnant, substance-using women, the more punitive, detrimental, and potentially dangerous it becomes for these women and their children. Federal Regulations on Confidentiality of Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Records The following guidelines explain Federal regulati ons concerning the confidentiality of alcohol and other drug referral and treatment information. Prohibition of Disclosure The Federal confidentiality regula tions prohibit disclosure of pa tient information as follows: Except under certain limited cond itions, Federal c onfidentiality regula tions prohibit the disclosure of records or othe r information concerning any pati ent in a federally assisted alcohol or drug abuse program.30 The prohibition on unauthorized disclosure ap plies whether or not the person seeking information already has the information, has ot her means of obtaining it, enjoys official status, has obtained a subpoena or warra nt, or is authori zed by State law.31 Any State provision that would permit or requ ire a disclosure prohi bited by the Federal rules is invalid. However, Stat e laws may require greater conf identiality than the Federal regulations.32 Re-disclosure of patient-identifying informati on is prohibited unless such disclosure is made in compliance with Federal confidentiality regulations. Exceptions to the Prohibition of Disclosure Although the general rule is that patient-identifying inform ation may not be disclosed, the regulations set out a number of conditions perm itting limited disclosures with patient consent and a very few circumstances in which disclosures may be made without patient consent. Each of these conditions or circumstances has its own requirements and limitations. In general, permitted disclosures are those made as follows: With the written informed consent of the patient Pursuant to internal program communications Pursuant to a medical emergency In response to a court order following a court hearing in which disclo sure is authorized Pursuant to a crime at the treatmen t program or against program personnel For research or audit purposes In the course of reporting child abuse Pursuant to a qualified serv ice organization agreement In response to a request for nonpa tient identifying information State Laws on Confidentiality of Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Records A variety of State confidentiali ty laws may affect how services are provided to pregnant, substance-using women. These laws may control th e release of medical re cords; limit the ability of persons to testify in court based on inform ation obtained when providi ng professional services (testimonial privilege); or prohibit disclosure of information regarding specific diseases, such as HIV and drug use. Service providers and alcoho l and other drug treatment staff should consult with local counsel to determine which State conf iden- tiality laws affect their practices, and develop protocols and training programs to help ensure th at these laws are followed. Training on Confidentiality and Reporting All individuals who provide services to pre gnant, substance-abusing women must understand Federal regulations on confidentiality and receiv e training on State and local laws, regulations, and reporting requirements. Providers of health care and social services include, but are not limited to, physicians, social workers, nurses, psychologists, psychi atrists, child protective service workers, teachers, child care workers, and alcohol and other drug counselors. Providers of health care and social services must be trained to unde rstand the differences among Federal, State, and local laws regardi ng confidentiality of information pertaining to alcohol and other drug treatment, medical care, mental health ca re, child abuse, and HIV/AIDS. Providers of health care and social servi ces must know the relevant reporting laws pertaining to child abuse and neglect. This knowledge should include who is mandated to report child abuse and neglect, under what circ umstances they are to report child abuse and neglect, and the penalty for not reporting such a buse and neglect. Programs serving pregnant, substance-using women are often part of community-based organizations or health care clinics. St aff of these programs must be aware of confidentiality laws and the right to informed consent as it relates to alcohol and other drug treatment. Cross-training concerning confidentiality and reporting must be give n to individuals who may not understand relevant laws. This include s individuals involved in medical, legal, educational, alcohol, and other drug treatment, and social service fields. Patient Records and the Courts Service providers and pregnant, substance-using women should be concerned with how courts handle patient records and th e circumstances under which courts can order medical and psychiatric evaluations. Once records go to adult court they become public record. Individuals concerned about court records and subpoenas need to understand the laws of thei r State. It should be noted that, in most but not all States, juvenile records are confidential. Courts can order an evaluation to determine if a woman needs treatment for alcohol and other drug abuse, to make a diagnosis, and to make a referral for treatment or services. This type of court-ordered ev aluation, with the written informed consent of the woman, may be shared with those court official s involved in the disposition of her case. Communicating With Patients About Confidentiality and Reporting Providers of health care and social services should explain and discuss confidentiality and reporting laws with patients when they first seek care. The Federal confidentiality regulations requi re treatment programs to inform pregnant, substance-using women about th eir right to confidentiality, as well as their right to information about laws concerni ng reporting and court involvement. Pregnant, substance-using women should be in formed by service providers about Federal, State, and local confidentiality and reporting laws, and how such laws will affect the delivery of services to them. Relevant area s of law may include the reporting of child abuse to appropriate authorities, custo dy consequences, and how courts may treat information contained in their records. No information that would identify a woman as an alcohol and other drug abuser or information from her treatment record may be disclosed to anyone outside the treatment facility without her writ ten informed consent. When written informed consent is obtained, it must be time-limited, content-specific, and signed by the woman, in keeping with the requirements of the Federal confidentiality laws. A copy of the written informed consent document must be offered to the woman. Confidentiality of Information on Infants and Children A woman has the right to contro l the release of confidential re cords and information pertaining to her infant. In order to release confidential information, th e written informed consent of the parent or legal guardian must be obtained. The written informed consent must meet all previously stated legal requirements controlling the release of confidential information. When a parent refuses to give consent, is incompetent to give consent, or cannot be found, the court may be requested to appoint a legal guardian for the child. This guardian is authorized to make medical decisions for the child, including the release of confidential information. Parental consent is not necessary when ex cused by law, which may vary by State. In many States, exceptions to blanket rules that require parental consent are made for medical emergencies and to re port child abuse and neglect. Unauthorized Release of Information Nonconsensual and unauthorized release of conf idential information may harm the child or mother and may subject the health care and social service provider to civil or criminal liability. To avoid this, agencies should develop protoc ols and procedures gove rning the release of information and train employees in their use. Agen cies should also provide staff with access to counsel who are knowledgeable in the area of confidentiality. The following information, at a minimum, should be covered in protocols and training: Elements of and procedures for obtaining written informed consent Situations where consent for the rele ase of information is not necessary Whether to notify the mother when information is permitted to be and is released without her consent How to respond to a request for information; for example, how to avoid responding in a manner that inadvertently and inappropriately confirms the existence of a medical or drug abuse condition How to limit disclosures to the information necessary and relevant for the provision of services to the mother or child, or to sa tisfy legal grounds for nonconsensual disclosure. Guideline 18\u2014Child Protective Services Child protective services agencies are mandated to help keep families together. Some women who enter alcohol and other drug treatment program s will be in contact w ith their local child protective services agency. Th ese women may not view this involvement positively. In turn, many alcohol and other drug treatment programs fi nd it difficult to deal with child custody and placement issues. As a result, some treatment programs exclude women who are or could potentially be involved with a ch ild protective services agency. Un til this circumstance changes, the doors to alcohol and other drug treatment will continue to cl ose on pregnant, substance-using women -- the very women who need to be admitted. Women should not be barred from treatment or di scriminated against because they are pregnant. It must be recognized that the family circumstan ces for women may be flui d, rather than static. Children may be periodically absent and subseque ntly return to the home. Furthermore, alcohol and other drug use is a chronic relapsing disease. Relapse prevention must be an important part of any treatment approach. Cross-service training of alcohol and other drug treatment staff and child protective services personnel should be supported. The a im of this joint training is to promote a better understanding of the issues common to both groups and to prom ote a strong working relationship between these service providers. The following guidelines address intervention and assessment, placement of children in temporary foster homes, and development of permanent placement plans. Intervention and Assessment Federal Laws All health care and social service providers shou ld be aware of the relevance of Public Law 96- 272, the Child Welfare Act of 1980, for persons e ligible for Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), as well as Public Law 95- 608, the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, for Native American families. Responsible efforts should be made to keep children with the biological parents in their own hom e. When children are removed to temporary foster placement, reasonable efforts should be made to reunite the families. State Laws State laws should be understood as those laws th at pertain to, build on, and are applicable to Public Law 96-272 and Public Law 95-608. Agreements on Child Custody When some women enter an alcohol and other drug treatment program, they will already have worked out an agreement about what must be done to keep their children. A treatment program should not discriminate against women on the basis of such agreements. However, women should also be informed of the legal risk they face with respect to program reporting policies. Information exchanged between the treatment prog ram and child protective service agency must adhere to the guidelines on confidentiality. Intervention With Children If the child protective services worker, in attempting to work with the family, finds that the children may be at risk of imminent harm, then court intervention may become necessary (see Placement in a Temporary Foster Home below). Anti\u00adDiscrimination Laws Treatment programs must comply with other laws , such as the Americans With Disabilities Act and the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as am ended. These laws prohibit discrimination in the use of public accommodations, including treatment programs. Placement in a Temporary Foster Home Involvement of the Court When a child remains at imminent risk of harm despite ongoing work with the family, the court may become involved. The child protective services worker is usually ma ndated to involve the cour t if the child is at imminent risk of harm and intervention servic es have failed. Alcohol and other drug use alone, however, should not be the sole cr iteria for court intervention. Court Placement Outside of the Home After adjudication, if the court fi nds the child at imminent risk of harm, the child may be placed with a suitable relative or in a foster home. This placement outside of the home should not be made until all reasonable efforts have been undertaken to keep the family together. Development of a Permanent Placement Plan Plans To Reunite the Family When the child is removed from the home of the pa rent, the plan must be to return that child at the earliest possible date when it can be safely undertaken. To this end, reasonable ongoing efforts must be made to reunite the family as soon as possible. Permanent Plans for Placement Away From Natural Parents Under certain circumstances, the court may decide that the permanent plan will be placement away from the natural parent; this may occur after all reasonable efforts ha ve been made to unite the family, when it is apparent that this unification cannot occur in the foreseeable future, and when such action is considered to be in the best interest of the child.

The array of problems confronting these women suggest s that training must be continuous. The process should begin with an assessment of the training need s of staff and result in a goal- oriented training plan. Training resources are often close at hand. Progr am staff should be canvassed for the skills and knowledge they pos sess. Personnel of other community programs represent a wealth of expert ise often waiting to be tapped. Community-based, collaborative training activities offer the adde d benefit of strengthening the networks that serve pregnant, substance-using women and their children. Training Teams The expertise of members of a training team should vary depending on the subject of the particular training being devel oped or delivered. Training teams may include a health educator (to develop curricula), nutritioni st, social worker, public health nurse, certified alcoholism and drug counselor, program administrator, phys ician, and mental health counselor. Training Areas Training for medical staff, alc ohol and other drug treatment providers, and others serving pregnant, substance-using women and thei r children should address these topics: Diagnosis and treatment Medical guidelines -- basics of prenatal, labor an d delivery, perinatal, and postpartum care Treatment readiness in substance-using women -- understanding aspects of the woman's readiness and/or motivation for treatment Assessment instruments -- uses and benefits of va rious instruments to measure substance use, as well as psychosocial, psychiatric, and parental functioning Dual diagnosis -- techniques for assessment and di agnosis, and treatment planning for mentally impaired, substance-using pregnant women Women with positive toxicology screens in alcohol and other drug treatment programs -- procedures for referral, counseli ng, and followup.

The section identifies specific services, presents staffing patterns, and includes costing assumptions recommended by experts from the fields of alcohol and other drug treatment and mental health. A model program has been designed with the under standing that not all St ates or localities are able to begin new programs. This model program is intended to be used as a guide or standard for developing a program, adding new services, or incorporating some of the guidelines into an already-existi ng program. The sample budget is based on the model program and lays out the requirements and formulas for estimating program costs. The cost assumptions can be tailored to cond itions that prevail in different geographic areas. For example, to es timate labor costs in a specific location, the prevailing salary/wage rates should be substituted for the rates used here. A list of Medicaid reimbursement rates for variou s medical procedures is presented as a guide. These rates represent the average reimbursement rate paid to States. A program's actual reimbursement rate for individual procedures may vary. Additional help on how to tailor the cost model is provided later in this section. Continuum of Care Model Program The model program is specifically designed to m eet the special needs of pregnant, substance- using women. The goal of the program is to provide comprehensive services that are appropriate and sensitive to the need s of the target population -- services that will en able women to secure prenatal care and other support throughout pregnancy, to achieve a successful delivery, and to receive 3 months of postpartum care. Services will be provided by a multidisciplinary team of health professionals, including medical or psychiatric social workers, obstetrical/gyn ecological (Ob/Gyn) speci alists, clinical nurse practitioners, and outreach workers. All health care serv ices will be provided in one setting, with the exception of laboratory work. If the patien t needs to undergo medical withdrawal or be hospitalized, referrals will be ma de to the appropriate programs. The model program will provide outreach services, laboratory workups, obstetrical and gynecological physicals, social work intervention , and appropriate followup services. In addition, the program will provide diagnosis , evaluation, and short-term clin ical interventions, along with medical management, to avoid exacerbation of symptoms and unnecessary hospitalizations. A case management model is used and will be di rected by the medical or psychiatric social worker to ensure that concrete services, a dvocacy, referral, and linkages to other service providers in the community are available. The woman's transition into providing child care and parenting will be facilitated by a complete and thorough assessment of her needs and the development of a comprehensive treatment plan. Continuum of Care Process and Staffing Pattern The staffing pattern for the model program is designed around a rotating team concept. There will be four treatment teams c onsisting of an outreach worker, medical or psychiatric social worker, Ob/Gyn physician, and clinical nurse prac titioner. Each treatment team will have a caseload of no more than 20 women, and the overa ll program capacity will be 80 slots. Initial staffing, outreach, intake, and patient scheduling will vary, and it may take several months for the program to be fully operational. During the first few months of program startup, the four outreach workers will be on-call each week. Based on their experience a nd knowledge of the treatment fi eld, the workers will provide outreach to women who are suspected alcohol an d other drug abusers. They will engage the women and facilitate their entr y into the program for prenat al care, delivery, and followup. The four clinical nurse practitioners will functio n as the intake team. Their duties will include facilitating all necessary workups prior to the first prenatal vis it and physical examination by the physician. All laboratory tests will be completed a nd results given to the physician for review within 1 month. Unless there is a medical emergency, an appoint ment with the physician will be scheduled for the patient within the first 2 months of the firs t trimester. The physician will see the patient on a monthly basis during the second tr imester and weekly visits will be scheduled during the third trimester. It is anticipated th at two part-time Ob/Gyn specialists should be able to handle the expected caseload. The four medical or psychiatric social workers will serve as case managers. They will initiate case management services toward the end of the first trimester -- after the patient has undergone preliminary assessment. Each case manager will be responsible for ensuring the patient has access to services within the pr ogram and in the community, and will serve as a liaison between the patient and her treatment team. The case manage r will work with the patient to ensure that she understands her treatment, including all per tinent medical procedures, laboratory tests, preparation for childbirt h, and followup plans. Additionally, the case manager will provide supportiv e counseling as needed, facilitate communication between all members of the tr eatment team, and conduct case conferences among all those involved in the woman's care, including community- based programs or services. Clinical nurse practitioners will help train the mo ther in such key areas as child care, parenting, and nutrition. After delivery, the medical or psychiat ric social worker will work with the clinical nurse practitioner to facilitate the appropriate integration of th e woman and her child into the community. Sample Model Program Budget and Costing Overview The following section looks at the costs associated with the operation of the model program to provide comprehensive medical care and case ma nagement services for pregnant, substance- using women that is described above. The sample budget is based on a static patient po pulation of 80 slots per year. The total number of patients served by the model program will be gr eater than the number of slots allocated, since patients will enter and leave at different points in the treatment continuum. The model program budget is based on these assumptions: The average length of stay in the model program is 1 year. The model program is fully operational. A range of salaries is presented, although the total budget reflects the high end of the range. Actual salaries will vary by geographic area. Two half-time physicians are hired for a total of one full-time equi valent (FTE) position. Laboratory charges are base d on a limited national survey and on single-unit prices. Actual costs will vary by geogr aphic area, particular ly if volume- discounts are available. Costs for sonograms are not included. An administrative overhead charge of 20 per cent of total wages and fringe benefits is included in the model budget to provide for th e costs of administrative supervision and support. The fringe benefit rate is calculated at 30 percent. A transportation allowance of $20 per patient slot is include d in the budget to cover the cost of bus tokens, cab vouchers, and so forth. The budget does not include indirect costs ne cessary for the operation of a facility. Examples of indirect costs that should be c onsidered part of an operating budget include o space rental o utilities o telephone o cleaning o insurance o equipment purchase/rental and maintenance/repairs o office supplies o depreciation o security services Other Cost Implications The sample budget does not include costs for delive ry of the baby or for alcohol and other drug treatment, including medical withdrawal. These co sts would be incurred regardless of the new services a program might offer, and vary from State to State. The program budget also does not look at reimburs ement issues. Before deciding to implement this program, Federal, State, local, and third party reimbursement program s need to be studied. These reimbursement sources may pay for part or all of any new services suggested by this model. Summary The need for comprehensive services for pregna nt, substance-using women is clear. The model program offers a case management approach to address the total needs of this population. Given the complexities of treating pregnant, substance- using women and the relative lack of resources, a significant number of women do not receive adequate care. The information provided in the guidelines, along with the suggestions in this section for program design, staffing, and costing, are intended to guide States and lo cal treat- ment programs in their efforts to provide services to this population.

TIP 2: Appendix D\u2014Quality Assurance Monitoring Alcohol and other drug treatment programs have increasingly used quality assurance (QA) techniques to maintain or improve the level of care provided to patients an d to contain costs. In addition, a quality assurance component is ofte n mandated for the licensu re and reimbursement of treatment programs. Every treatment progr am should have an ongoing and active quality assurance program. Experience has demonstrated th at pregnant, substance-abusing women entering treatment need a wide range of support services. To provide this comprehensive leve l of care, treatment staff must marshall the resources of a host of other agenci es through referral and co llaboration. The careful monitoring of these referral and in teragency collaborative activities on behalf of patients is a key quality assurance function for tr eatment programs. Monitoring should cover these aspects: Documentation of referrals and th e sharing of patient information Compliance with Federal and State confidentiality regulations Preparation of interagency agreements Assurance of linkage and documen tation of collaborative activities Referrals and Information Sharing It is well known that merely making referrals for patients neither ensures that services are received nor guarantees the quality of the services that are delive red. One of the key functions of a QA program is to monitor the process of re ferral. A well-designed QA program will routinely select a sample of all patient records and relate d referrals and monitor these sources to ensure that linkage has occurred. Documentation must be made of the results of th e monitoring and related actions taken to correct any problems and improve services. Examples of quality assurance monitoring activities are as follows: Monitor patient records to ensure that proper referrals were made. Monitor patient records to ensure that appr opriate and necessary information was shared with the referral agency (e.g., reason for the referral and problems to be addressed). Monitor referral logs, payment vouchers, or other referral documentation for completeness and appropriateness (e.g., Is payment appropriate to the services provided?). Monitor patient records to ensure that linkage was documented (e.g., Was the patient evaluated and accepted for services?). Monitor patient records for notes of treatme nt progress and/or c ontinued service (e.g., regular documentation of treatment progress), or documentation that services were no longer needed (e.g., documentation of the followup services that were being provided and why services were no longer needed). Confidentiality Compliance Every agency that provides services to pregna nt, substance-using wome n must ensure that internal policies and procedures comply with both Federal and State conf identiality and reporting regulations (see Guideline 17 -- Confidentiality and Reporting ). Once compliance is ensured through the development of policies and staff trai ning, a process of quality assurance monitoring should be developed to routinely review a sample of all program records. Documentation must be made of the results of such monitoring and re lated actions taken to co rrect any problems and improve services. Examples of quality assu rance monitoring activities are as follows: Monitor for documentation that service provide rs informed patients of their rights to confidentiality and offered informa tion about possible court involvement. Monitor for documentation that service providers informed patients of all laws that were relevant to their specific circumstances. Monitor to ensure that there is a written in formed consent on file whenever there were discussions concerning patients with individuals or organiza tions outside the treatment facility. Monitor to ensure that the written informed consent is time-limited, content-specific, person-to-person, signed, and witnessed. Interagency Agreements In order for interagency collaboration and linka ge to be successful, there must be a written document that clearly delineates the responsibilities of the cooperating agencies. Interagency agreements, at a minimum, should have these characteristics: Describe the services to be provided by each agency. Describe the referral process to be used and the documentation requirements of each agency. Establish a timeframe for the review a nd possible revision of the agreement. Examples of quality assurance mon itoring activities are as follows: Monitor to ensure that the referring agency provided all appropriate and necessary patient information to the referral agency. Monitor to ensure that there is documentat ion that the referral agency provided all agreed-upon services in a timely manner. Monitor to ensure that the referral agency provided documentation to the referring agency of patient progress, continued need for servi ces, or readiness for te rmination of services. Other Important Areas for Quality Assurance Monitoring Additional aspects of linkage and collaborative ac tivity that are appropriat e for quality assurance monitoring include: Monitor to ensure that linkage occurred, as demonstrated by the acceptance of patients into followup care. Monitor to ensure that there is documentat ion for patients who were not accepted for treatment (e.g., reasons why patients were not ap propriate for the facility, and what steps were taken to link patients to appropriate services). Monitor to ensure that there is documentat ion for the discharge of pregnant patients. Although the discharge of pr egnant patients from treat ment is not recommended, occasions may arise that necessitate this course of action. There must be full documentation of the rationale for discharge and the attempts that were made to maintain patients in treatment. For example, when pa tients are discharged for noncompliance, there must be documentation of the steps taken to encourage treatment compliance. Similarly, there should be documentation of the referral of patients to alternative treatment. Monitor to ensure that there is documentation of the referral of patients when the agency was unable to provide necessary services (e.g., Are patients referred to a methadone program when needed?). Monitor to ensure that patients have a treatment pl an listing all required serv ices and that there is documentation of patient progre ss for all referred services.
