We are [reporting]a case of [optic neuropathy]post COVID [vaccination]. The exact mechanism remains unclear. Case A 42-year-old [male], post Pfizer [vaccine];presented with 3-day [history]of acute onset of painful blurry [vision]in revealed decreased [visual acuity], [afferent [eye]. He was treated high [dose] [steroids]for 3 days followed by oral [steroid]taper. Follow up visit showed significant improvement in his [vision]. Design/ Methods:Information Conclusions: [Vaccine] [administration]has been associated with a wide variety of inflammatory mediated CNS demyelinating [syndromes]that usually appear few days [incidence]of post- [vaccination]ON being much lower than for ON alone. Most cases were reported post AstraZeneca [vaccine], Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac. [Autoantibodies]against MOG were mostly detected. The condition is treated spontaneously and both [steroid]responsive and [plasma exchange]. The underlying mechanism in post [vaccination]ON is systemic autoimmune process in contrast to regular ON cases, which are predominantly [Multiple Sclerosis]linked. Majority of [patients]had no prior [history]of neuro-inflammation and the [risk]is higher a [history]of [autoimmune disease]. [Buscar "}
