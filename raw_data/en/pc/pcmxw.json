Originally, it is ritually used by different ethnicities from the Amazon 41 basin as a remedy against bad luck in hunting. In the last twenty years, Kamb\u00f4 has spread to Western 42 urban centers, of ten associated with the use of ayahuasca. Anecdotal reports claim beneficial effects 43 on wellbeing and different medical and mental health conditions. However, to date it has been 44 controversial if Kamb\u00f4 elicits altered state s of consciousness. Here we retro spectively investigated 45 acute and subacute psychological effects of Kamb\u00f4 in a sample of n = 22 anonymous users (n = 22, 46 mean age: 39 years, \u00b1 8.5 ; 45.5% female) , administering standardized questionnaires for the 47 assessment of psychoactive effects . Acute ly, participants reported psychological effects which 48 remained on a mild to moderate level , but no psychedelic -type distortions of perception or thinking . 49 In contrast, persisting effects were predominantly described as positive and pleasant, revealing 50 surprisingly high measures of personal and spiritual significance . Subacute and long -term effects 51 showed some overlap with the \"afterglow\" phenomena that follow the use of serotonergic 52 psychedelics. 53 54 KEYWORDS : 55 Kamb\u00f4 license made available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

A variety of potent 60 bioactive peptides have been identified in the frog\u00b4s phyllokinin, dermorphine and 62 caeruelin 1. Kamb\u00f4 is obtained from the frog by carefully tying it up and rubbing its skin with a hard 63 instrument, collecting the secretion on a wooden stick. It has been emphasized that in most cases the 64 frog is treated with utmost respect and caution, in order to not harm it , and release d it to its natural 65 habitat once tha t the secretion is collected 3 . 66 Given its low oral bioavailability, Kamb\u00f4 is most commonly applied by the applicator to the recipient 67 via several fresh superficial burns (\" dots\") on the arms, legs or chest 4. Anecdotally, it has been 68 described that w ithin minutes , the secretion likely enters the lymphatic system and subsequently the 69 blood, thereby inducing an intense reaction that includ es hypotension, sweating, tachycardia, heavy 70 vomiting and edema , usually subsiding within an hour . This is followed by listlessne ss or sleep and, 71 subsequently, a state \"perhaps to be described as euphoric\", characterized by increased stamina and 72 clarity of thoughts with an increased capacity for hunting 1. In Amazonian ethnicities, Kamb\u00f4 is used as 73 a cleansing ritual to liberate hunters from \"bad principles\" or bad luck in hunting (\"panema\"), 74 enhancing the recipient \u00b4s capacities once that cleansing has occurred and acute effects have subsided5. 75 During the last 20 years, Kamb\u00f4 has found its way to Western urban centers i n Brazil and all over the 76 world 6. Notably, to date none of the substances that have been identified in the Kamb\u00f4 secretion 77 display any serotonergic activity. However, from its Amazonian origins to its use in the context of 78 Brazilian syncretic religions like the Santo Daime and the Uni \u00e3o do Vegetal 5 and, finally, to its use in 79 Western healing circles , Kamb\u00f4 has often been associated with the spread of the serotonergic 80 psychedelic ayahuasca 7. Ayahuasca is an Amazonian shamanic concoction of different plants, including 81 plants (e.g. of monoaminoxidase (MAO -I) that render 83 N,N-DMT orally active 8. Notably, Kamb\u00f4 does not necessarily have to be applied by a shaman and is 84 not considered as a shamanic ritual itself , in contrast to ayahuasca and other ritual plants, where use 85 is restricted to a shamanic framework 9. During its spread to Western urban centers, however, the 86 Kamb\u00f4 ritual has been transformed from a hu nting ritual into therapeutic approaches and a neo - 87 shamanic healing ritual, a process which has been labeled as \"shamanization of Kamb\u00f4 \" 10. 88 The association with ayahuasca, however, is not the only connection between Kamb\u00f4 and nature - 89 derived serotonergic psychedelics. Notably, different names used for the frog\u00b4s secretion include 90 \"Kamb\u00f4 \", \"kampu\", \"vaccino da floresta\" and also \"sapo\", means \"toad\" in Spanish. 91 .

In contrast to Kamb\u00f4 , 93 however, the secretion bufotenine , which is usually smoked or snorted, immediately 95 inducing strong psychedelic experiences 12. Given the different application routes , the two substances 96 are usually not confused by users, even though ceremonies where secretions from Kamb\u00f4 and Bufo 97 alvarius are combined have recently been proposed in Western psychedelic circles. 98 Another interesting overlap between Kamb\u00f4 and the use of plant -derived psychedelics can be found 99 in anecdotal reports describ ing beneficial after -effects on wellbeing, medical and mental health 100 problems and personal and spiritual development 13 - attributes which have previously been 101 associated with the use of serotonergic psychedelics. Of note, the effects of serotonergic psychedelics 102 underlie unique temporal dynamics, with distinct acute (\" psychedelic experiences \" or \" states \") and 103 subacute effects (\"afterglow \" phenomena ) 14. Afterglow phenom ena h ave been conceptualized as 104 states of \"elevated and energetic mood with a relative freedom from concerns of the past and from 105 guilt and anxiety \", which are associated with an enhanced willingness \"to enter into close interpersonal 106 relationships \", lasting between two weeks and a month 15 . If these effects are comparable to the after - 107 effects of Kamb\u00f4 is an open question. 108 Despite the close cultural and sub -cultural associations between the use of Kamb\u00f4 and different 109 nature -derived psychedelics, no systematic characterization of the acute or subacute effects of Kamb\u00f4 110 has been reported . Here, we report results of a paper -pencil study among Kamb\u00f4 users employing 111 standardized and validated questionnaires to retrospectively report acute and subacute effects of 112 Kamb\u00f4 . This assessment allows a direct comparison to data from other psychoactive substances and 113 answers in how far the effects of Kamb \u00f4 display similarities with serotonergic psychedelic s 16. 114 Our study was designed to (1) systematically characterize the acute effects of Kamb\u00f4 , enabling a direct 115 comparison to acute effects of e.g. plant -derived serotonergic psychedelics , (2) explore if Kamb\u00f4 116 displays subacute effects which might be comparable to the psychedelic afterglow phenomena , 117 including retrospective appraisal of the experiences by the recipients. 118 119 RESULTS 120 Sample characteristics 121 N = 27 datasets were sent back to us , of which n = 5 were excluded due to an insufficient reliability 122 index in the PCI (cut -off h > 2), leaving a final dataset of n = 22 for the first part of the study . The 123 consecutive part of the study on the subacute effects of Kamb \u00f4 was completed by n = 14, where one 124 .

In n = 2 (9.1%) cases an indigenous shaman and in n = 143 3 (13.6%) cases a layperson was reported to have administered Kamb \u00f4 (n = 1 \"other\" and n = 1 not 144 specified). N = 14 (63.6%) of the participants reported being the only client while receiving Kamb \u00f4, 145 while n = 7 (31.8%) received it in a group setting (n = 1 not specified) . The setting and environment 146 was described as follow s: a healing place or temple (n = 11, 52.4%), at home ( n = 4, 19.0%), in nature 147 (n = 2, 9.5%), in a ceremony ( n = 2, 9.5%), other ( n = 2, 9.5%), in a friend \u00b4s home (n = 1, 4.8%), with an 148 alternative health practitioner practice (n = 1, 4.8%), at a festival ( n = 1, 4.8%), on vacation ( n = 1, 4.8%). 149 Participants reported that Kamb\u00f4 was applied via an average of 7 \u00b1 2 burning points on the 150 participants ' skin. The acute experience lasted less than 15 minutes for n = 6 (27.3%) participants, 151 between 30 and 59 minutes for n = 11 (50.0%) participants , 60 minutes or longer for n = 3 (13.6%) 152 participants (n = 2 not specified) . We asked participants explicitly if they thought that Kamb\u00f4 induces 153 a \"Rauschzustand\" (German word for \"inebriation \" or \"high\") , and n = 5 (22. 7 %) r eported \"Yes\". 154 Acute effects were assessed retrospectively using the ASC rating scale, the PCI, the MEQ and CEQ to 155 assess altered state experiences allowing for direct comparison to hallucinogenic substances and non - 156 pharmacologic al methods that elucidate psychotropic effects.

The core of psyc hedelic experience is currently best assessed with 206 the 11D-ASC questionnaire , the most commonly used tool to assess drug -induced ASCs . The 11D -ASC 207 allows for characterization of subjective effects along 11 dimension s of change in conscious 208 experience. Psychedelic experiences are typically cha racterized by high scores on the scales 209 Elementary and Complex Imagery, Insightfulness, Spiritual Experience, Experience of Unity and Blissful 210 State 16. In contrast, for Kamb\u00f4 we found only relatively low scores on these dimensions . Thus, our 211 study demonstrates with standardized questionnaire data that Kamb\u00f4 does not elicit effects on 212 consciousness comparable to serotonergic psychedelics, especially no comparable effects are reported 213 on perception and thinking . 214 More over , we applied the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) . This tool is u sed to test for the 215 occurrence of spiritual/mystical experience s, which are thought to have the potential to facilitate 216 conversions, attitude -changes, or even life-changes under special circum stances . High values of \"full- 217 blown \" mystical experiences have been reported for sev eral serotonergic psychedelics including LSD 218 17, psilocybin 18, and 5 -methoxy -dimethyltryptamine 19. In our sample, few participants reported 219 pronounced aspects of mystical experiences , reflected by relatively low mean scores on the four MEQ 220 factors, w ith a few higher outlier datapoints. Even if Kamb\u00f4 effects cannot be compared to intense 221 mystical experiences as reported after the use of serotonergic psychedelics 20 with regard to intensity 222 and completeness of the mystical state , our finding suggests that participants might have experienced 223 psychological and spiritual effects beyond merely somatic reactions . However, th is conclusion remains 224 somewhat speculative , and setting as well as expectational and setting facto rs could have contributed 225 to this effect. 226 The Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) include s self-report items designed for the 227 investigation of challenging experiences under psilocybin and other serotonergic psychedelics.

The challenging experiences reported for acute effects of Kambo were mostly limited 231 to \"physical distress\" . Challenging experiences of a rather psychological nature were barely reported 232 - suggesting unspecific fearful reactions to the strong vegetative effects , but without induction of 233 psychedelic -type psychological crises including insanity, isolation, death or paranoid ideation in the 234 sense of \"bad trips\", reflect ing distortions of ego functions and self -processing . 235 Ratings o n the Phenomenology of Consciousn ess Inventory (PCI) allow for comparison of Kambo 236 experiences with hypnosis or meditation techniques to investigate potential shared aspects. Similar to 237 hypnotic or meditative states, participants reported a reduction of positive and negative affect in their 238 Kamb\u00f4 experience s (Pekala 2017). With regard to the question if or how Kamb\u00f4 elicits psychoactive 239 effects , it is notew orthy the obtained scores on \"self-awareness \", \"rationality \", \"attention \" and 240 \"memory \" indicate that the participants did not f eel confused or muddled, which would be expected 241 from centrally active drugs like alcohol or barbiturates. 242 Taken together , our study provides standardized data that allow s a direct comparison of Kamb\u00f4 243 experiences to the effects of well-known psychoactive substances. O n the physi ological level, the acute 244 Kamb\u00f4 experience is dominated by an intensive physical reaction, which is reflected in the reports of 245 \"physical distress\" by our participants and is also likely to have triggered psychological distress in some 246 participants. The process of characterizing acute Kamb\u00f4 effects with standardized questionnaires in 247 the present study revealed that Kambo induces a state of self -centered inwardness. This state does 248 not have typical characteristics of psy chedelic -induced states. Although the pharmacodynamics of the 249 Kamb\u00f4 secretion have only been partially investigated, it has been suggested that Kamb\u00f4 \u00b4s 250 pharmacological effects are restricted to the cardiovascular, gastroenterological, endocrine and 251 immune systems, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and the endogenous opioid system 9. On the 252 one hand, this appears to be plausible given the compounds\u00b4 peptide structures which prevent them 253 from passing the blood -brain barrier. On the other hand, the authors hypothesize that the 254 neuropeptide opioids in Kamb\u00f4 (dermorphin, caerulein and deltorphin) could be for the 255 observed \"alterations of consciousness\", suggesting psychoactive effects. However, given the 256 neuropeptide structure, these opioids have been reported to be centrally active via intrathecal 257 application only. In addition, the described acute and subacute effects of Kamb\u00f4 resemble st imulant 258 effects rather than those of substances with mu-receptor activity . Thus, the observed acute and 259 subacute effects in our sample are divergent from known psychoactive effects of mu -receptor 260 agonists, suggesting that other compounds or complex interac tions between vegetative, neuro - 261 endocrinological and psychological effects might be considered as underlying biological correlates of 262 the Kamb\u00f4 experience . Nevertheless, to date no compounds have been identified that could explain 263 .

Since no systematic characterization of afterglow phenomena exist s to 269 date, even for psychedelics, a quantitative comparison was not possible. Therefore, a s a first 270 description of the subacute effects we used the PEQ, previously applied to characterize psychedelic 271 effects mainly in therapeutic contexts. Additionally, we used a questionnaire measuring 272 connectedness , which has not yet been validated . 273 Notably, subacute effects of Kamb\u00f4 were appraised very positively , including \"positive behavioural changes\", whereas negative aspects 275 have been reported to be negligible . This is in line wi th observations describing a euphoric state after 276 the acute effects of Kamb\u00f4 have subsided 1. Moreover, subacute effects involved dimensions of mood, 277 overall wellbeing, but also aspects on a spiritual and transpersonal level. The intensity of subacute 278 positive effects was pronounced, even if not as intense as after -effects of lysergic acid diethylamide 279 (LSD) 22 or psilocybin 23. 280 Interestingly, the ratings of items describing connectedness to internal aspects of oneself were high in 281 our sample , such as being connected to \"my senses\", \"a and \"insight/intuition\" , and t o \"have been fully able to experience emotion, 283 whether positive or negative\". In co ntrast , ratings of items referring to connectedness to aspects (e.g. source of universal love\") were far less pronounced , except for the experience of being \"connected 286 to nature \". This is in li ne with anecdotal observations including participants\u00b4 subjective experiences of 287 an active interaction with a frog\u00b4s \"spirit \", which detect s and eliminat es toxins and bad energy from 288 their mind and body 9. However, t his finding is only part ially comparable to mystical experiences 289 associated with acute and subacute effects of serotonergic psychedelics , where states of increased 290 connectedness to both the self and other beings have been reported 23(i.e. the notion that \"everything 291 is interconnected\"). 292 Notably, even if the subacute effects were not comparable to those reported after the use of 293 serotonergic psychedelics regarding intensity and qualitative aspects 2223, some of the phenomena 294 which outlasted the acute effects were surprisingly intensive and complex, showing overlaps with 295 psychedelic \"afterglow phenomena \", including increases in positive mood, behavior, attitudes and 296 social in teraction. 297 .

Our data were collected retrospectively from a group of Western Kamb\u00f4 users 300 recruited through a public workshop on Kamb \u00f4 and a group of practitioners devoted to a specific ritual 301 setting . This might have induced a bias of expectations or motivations for use and thereby involved 302 the placebo dimension. The observed variability in the assessed acute e ffects suggest s that 303 expectational factors and setting might have played a role for some reports . In order to make final 304 conclusions about the psychoactive properties of Kamb\u00f4, randomized placebo -controlled trials are 305 necessary. 306 Conclusion 307 Our findings demonstrate that the acute effects of Kamb\u00f4 are very different from the effects of 308 serotonergic psychedelics . While the acute effects of Kamb\u00f4 are dominated by strong physical 309 reactions followed by a state of increased inwardness, psychedeli c eff ects appear to facilitate 310 loosening of ego barriers and increase d connectedness with oneself and the outer world. Our findings 311 are congruent with anecdotal reports that the subacute effects of Kamb\u00f4 include feelings of being 312 energized with increased stamina and clarity of thoughts, follow ing an initial state of physical sickness 313 and exhaustion. Nevertheless, subacutely , Kamb\u00f4 does exhibit some overlap with serotonergic 314 psychedelics in regard to the reported \"afterglow \" phenomenon 15. This finding is striking given the 315 unique temporal d ynamics of subacute psychedelic effects , incomparable to any other group of 316 psychoactive substances. Kamb\u00f4 thereby appears to be associated with afterglow -like effects, but 317 without preceding psychedelic states . In agreement with our findings , it has been suggested that the 318 transformative and transpersonal effects of Kamb\u00f4 might be comparable to those associated with the 319 use of serotonergic psychedelics 9. 320 321 METHODS 322 Participants and Procedure 323 All data of this study was collected anonymously. Potential participants were recruited at a drug 324 information event in Berlin and through Kamb\u00f4 practitioners who forwarded study material to their 325 clients . Participants were infor med about the study aim and that data collection is fully 326 anonymously . They were handed out a printed set of paper/pencil -questionnaires together with a pre - 327 paid envelope for returning completed sets of questionnaires and gave consent by filling the 328 questi onnaire and sending it back anonymously. All procedures were conducted in accordance with 329 the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the Ethics committee of the Charit\u00e9 330 .

All questionnaires were applied in Germa n. The first set of 331 questions addre ssed person specific characte ristics, such as age, gender and drug consum ption history . 332 Apart from questions referring to demographic information, a set of questionnaires was given to the 333 parti cipants that com prised the following two parts: (1) questionnai res on the acute effects of an 334 exemplary Kamb\u00f4 session, (2) questionnaires on subacute effects of the exemplary Kamb\u00f4 session. All 335 parti cipants were requested to fill in demographi c information and (1). Participants were aske d to fill 336 in (2) only if the exemplary Kamb\u00f4 session that they reporte d about in (1) happe ned between 2 - 3 337 weeks ago, as the questions on the acute effects addressed this period after the Kamb\u00f4 session. 338 As exclusion criterion for data of insufficient quality we used the reliability index (h) of the 339 Phenom enology of Consci ousne ss Inventory (PCI), which is a measure for the parti cipants consi stency 340 in com pleting the questionnai re 24. 341 Assessment of acute subjective effects of Kam b\u00f4 342 The second set of questions com prised four well establ ished and validate d psychom etric tools to asse ss 343 acute subjective experiences of consci ousne ss alterations: 344 Altered States of Consciousness (ASC) Rating Scale: The ASC rating scale 25,26 originate d from two 345 former versions, the initial APZ (Abnormal Mental States; GERMAN: Abnorm e revised version OAV 30 and has becom e one of the most frequently used questionnai res in 347 the asse ssment of altered state s of consci ousne ss phenom ena. The ASC rating scale is suppose d to 348 investigate characteristics of consci ousne ss alterations that are invariant across various condi tions 349 including both pharmacological (e.g., psilocybin, ketamine, DMT) and behavioral induction methods 350 (e.g., sensory deprivation, hypnosis, autogenic training). Over the course of more than 30 years , the 351 questionnai re unde rwent several refinements finally leading to the curre ntly used version which 352 com prises ntly two and the 11-dimensional sche me (11D-ASC) 31. 354 Phenomenology of Consciousness Inventory (PCI): The PCI was developed in the context of an 355 interdisciplinary approach described as empirical-phenom enology 24,32. Most notably influenced by C. 356 T. Tart's (1975) conception of ASCs, where different state s are characte rized by distinct structure s and 357 patte rns of the subjective experience 24 (p. 192). The PCI assesses subjective experiences along multiple 358 dimensions, where corre spondi ng scales were constructe d on the basis of several cluste r and factor 359 anal yses. Items are presented as two opposi ng ments (e.g. \"I felt ecstatic and joyful\" - \"I felt no 360 feelings of being ecstatic and joyful\") located on the two poles of a 7-point Likert scale.

Since then, the MEQ has been applied as 365 an instrument for the quantitative assessment of pharmac ologically induced mystical experience. 366 Items of the MEQ were chosen based on literature about mysticism including first -person accounts as 367 well as theoretical work, most notably by W . James (1902) and W. T. Stace (1960). The initial MEQ has 368 been further d eveloped by Pahnke (1969), Richards (1975), Griffiths et al. (2006; 2011), and MacLean 369 et al. (2012) . The most recent version is the MEQ30 36, a condensed version of the MEQ with thirty 370 items and four empirical scales 37 38. 371 Challenging Experiences Questionnaire (CEQ) : The CEQ was designed to provide a tool for the 372 comprehensive assessment of acute negative effects of temporarily induced altered states of 373 consciousness 39, based on three questionnaires: Hallucinogenic Rating Scale (HRS), 5D -ASC, and States 374 of Consciousness Questionnaire (SOCQ). The conceptual scope of the 26 -item CEQ is informed by 375 literature on psychological and physical distress following hallucinogen intake and covers a variety of 376 adverse cognitive, affective, and somatic reactions which are clustered into seven distinct dime nsions 377 of challenging experiences 37. Analyzing data from an online survey on negative experiences with 378 psilocybin, corresponding scales for the first six dimension were derived by exploratory factor analysis, 379 complemented by the Paranoia scale, and subsequently validated throug h confirmatory factor analysis 380 39. Items are rated on a 6 -point scale adopted from the SOCQ. 381 Assessment of subacute subjective effects of Kamb\u00f4 382 The third set of questionnaires addressing subacute effects was introduced with the instructions to fill 383 out the following questionnaires only if the exemplary Kambo session (for which the acute effects were 384 reported) had happened up to 3 weeks before the day of completing the questionnaire. The set of 385 questions comprised the following two questionnaires: 386 Items about Connectedness: We used a previously unpublished set of 23 questions to mea sure 387 different aspects of connectedness 40. The items include aspects of connectedness to one\u00b4s self, 388 connectedness to the universe and connectedness to others. The items stem from the development 389 of a connectedness scale (CS) . As no validation or confirmation of a factor structure had been publis hed 390 until now, the scores on this scale are presented for the individual items. 391 Persisting Effects Questionnaire (PEQ): The PEQ was developed as a follow -up questionnaire to the 392 States of Consciousness Questionnaire (SOCQ), which was an intermediate versio n of the MEQ 20. The 393 PEQ assesses long -term changes in participants. We used a German version of the extended PEQ 394 version reported in 23. This version uses 140 items rated on a 6 -point Likert scale from 0 ('not at all') 395 .
