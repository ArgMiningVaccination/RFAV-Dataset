I'm Dr. Mikell Parsons, DC and I'm a chiropractor in Fresno. (That's me second from the left, surrounded by my Dream Team!) I'm called the Holistic Detective because I use a wide range of holistic, natural treatments here at the Natural Path Health Center in Fresno, California to help my patients (kids and adults) reduce pain and brain fog, [heal injuries](https://naturalpathfresno.com/chiropractic/), [clear out toxicity,](https://naturalpathfresno.com/detox/) become [gluten-free](https://naturalpathfresno.com/certified-gluten-practitioner/), reduce fatigue and make their bodies healthy again without drugs or surgery. I specialize in working with infants, spectrum and sensory kids, pregnant women and those with fatigue and irritability. I've had years of education, self-study and invested in certifications because I discovered chiropractic at a young age after a terrible accident. I'm a Fresno-based chiropractor specializing in chiropractic for children (pediatric chiropractic), prenatal care, chronic conditions and sports injuries. As a nutritionist, I focus on helping you become gluten-free, detox, treat fatigue and reduce inflammation. I'm also a certified gluten practitioner and I can help you decide if and when you should go gluten-free. Finally, I am a brain-training specialist focused on brain wellness using NeuroIntegration Therapy to help you with anxiety, depression, insomnia, addiction, ADHD, memory and pain management. You'll find out a lot more about these treatments and about me on our site. Call the Natural Path Health Center Today.
