The aim is to make this information widely available to paediatricians, nurses, other health work ers and administrators in resource poor settings where up-to-date informa tion is hard to find. It is hoped that such information will be helpful in reviewing treatmen t policies, clinical practice and public health strategies. The method of searching for studies to include uses Pubmed, a search engine that is freely available and widely used in most countries thro ughout the world. The search strategy has been chosen to try to capture as many relevant stud ies as possible, although it is possible that some are missed. If you know of a relevant RCT that has not been included in this year's review, please let me know. The search strategy is reproducible by anyone with access to the Internet, through http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov /entrez/query.fcgi Randomized controlled trials (RCT s) are far from the only valuab le scientific evidence, and some RCTs, because of problems with design or implementation have limited value. However the method of the Randomized Trial is the Gold St andard for determining attributable benefit or harm from clinical and public health interv entions. When appropr iately performed they eliminate bias and confounding. However their re sults should not be acc epted uncritically and they should be evaluated for quality and validity . Before the result of an RCT can be generalized to another setting ther e must be consideration of the wider applicability, feasibility and potential for sustainability. This year there were 161 studies identified. These came from all regions of the world, mostly from developing country researchers. Several trials from 2007-08 may lead to significant changes in child health approaches or clinic al recommendations. So me key findings include: Outpatient treatment of WHO defined seve re pneumonia was shown to be safe and effective in children without complications and in areas that are not HIV endemic Giving zinc and ORS to children with dia rrhoea improves prescribing of ORS, and reduces subsequent morbidity from acute respiratory infection In HIV-affected infants in Zambia, mortalit y was higher when there was abrupt weaning from breast milk at 4 months of age. Giving mothers nevirapine or nevirapine and zidovudine for 14 weeks has a strong protective effect against HIV transmission through breast milk. A package of home-based antenatal and ne onatal care reduced neonatal mortality in Bangladesh In Kenya there has been sustained benefit on child survival of insecticide treated bed- nets; it was estimated that 7 deaths were averted for every 100 be d-nets distributed. Topically applied sunflower oil improved survival rate s among preterm hospitalized infants in Bangladesh. Rectally administered quinine is effective fo r the treatment of severe malaria, as has been shown with dihydroartimisinin and arte sunate, useful where intravenous access is not possible or the child is vomiting IV phenytoin, IV valproate or buccal midazola m are effective and safe for the treatment of status epilepticus. Diazepam should not be given as an IV infusion. Artimisinin derivatives have important anti-schistosomal effects. 3Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 We have again included the web-link for papers that are freely available in full-text on the Internet. This year there were 121 such studies, an increase on previous years indicating the increased numbers of open access on-line journals. More importantly, through HINARI ( http://www.who.int/hinari/en/ ) a program set up by WHO in collaboration with major publishers, the full-text version of over 3750 journa ls are available to health institutions in 113 countries.

Does 3-day course of oral amoxycillin benefit children of non-severe pneumonia with wheeze: a know, India. sawasthi@sancharnet.in BACKGROUND: WHO-define d pneumonias, treated with antibiotics, are responsible for a significant proportion of childhood mo rbidity and mortality in th e developing countries. Since substantial proportion pneumonias have a vira l etiology, where children are more likely to present with wheeze, there is a concern that curr ently antibiotics are being over-prescribed for it. Hence the current trial was conducted with the obj ective to show the therapeutic equivalence of two treatments (placebo and amoxycillin) for ch ildren presenting with non-severe pneumonia with wheeze, who have persistent fast breathing after nebulisation with salbutamol, and have normal chest radiograph. METHODOLOGY: This multi-centric, randomised placebo controlled double blind clinical trial intended to investigate equivalent efficacy of placebo and amoxicillin and was conducted in ambulatory care settings in eight government hospitals in India. Participants were children aged 2-59 months of age, who received either oral amoxycillin (31-54 mg/Kg/day, in three divided doses fo r three days) or placebo, and standard bronchodilator therapy. Primary outcome was clinical failure on or before day- 4. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We randomized 836 cas es in placebo and 835 in amoxycillin group. Clinical failures occurred in 201 (24.0%) on placebo and 166 (19.9%) on amoxycillin (risk difference 4.2% in favour of antibiotic, 95% CI: 0.2 to 8.1). Adherence for both placebo and amoxycillin was >96% and 98.9% subjects were fo llowed up on day- 4. Clinical failure was associated with (i) placebo treatment (adjusted OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.01 to1.62), (ii) excess respiratory rate of >10 breaths per minute (adjusted OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.92), (iii) vomiting at enrolment (adjusted OR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.13, 1.96), (iv) history of use of broncho- dilators (adjusted OR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.30, 2.24) CI: 14.92). CONCLUSIONS: Treating children with non-severe pneumonia and wheeze with a placebo is not equivalent to treatment with or al amoxycillin. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00407394.

Rawalpindi General Hospita l, Rawalpindi, Pakistan. OBJECTIVE: To five days' treatment with injectable ampicillin plus gentamicin compared with chloramphenicol re duces treatment failure in children aged 2-59 months with community acquired very severe pneumonia in low resource settings. DESIGN: Open label randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Inpatient wards within tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh, Ecuador, India, Mexico, Pa kistan, Yemen, and Zambia. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 2-59 months with WHO define d very severe pneumonia. INTERVENTION: Chloramphenicol versus a combination of ampicillin plus gentamicin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measure was treatmen t failure at five days. Secondary outcomes were treatment failure defined similarly among a ll participants evaluated at 48 hours and at 10 and 21 days. RESULTS: More children failed treatment with chloramphenicol at day 5 (16% v 11%; relative risk 1.43, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.97) and also by days 10 and 21. Overall, 112 bacterial isolates were obt ained from blood and lung aspirates in 110 children (11.5%), with the most common organisms being St aphylococcus aureus (n=47) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=22). In subgroup analysis, bacteraemia with any organism increased the risk of treatment failure at 21 days in the chloram phenicol group (2.09, 1.41 to 3.10) but not in the ampicillin plus gentamic in group (1.12, 0.59 to 2.13). Similarly, isolation of S pneumoniae increased the risk of treatment failure at day 21 (4.06, 2.73 to 6.03) and death (5.80, 2.62 to 12.85) in the chloramphenicol group but not in the ampicillin plus gentamicin group. No difference was found in treatment failure for children with S aureus bacteraemia in the two groups, but the power to detect a di fference in this subgroup analysis was low. Independent predictors of treatment failure by multivariate analysis were hypoxaemia (oxygen saturation <90%), receiving chlo ramphenicol, female, CONCLUSION : ampicillin plus gentam icin is to injectable chloramphenicol for the treatment of commu nity acquired very severe pneumonia in children aged 2-59 months in low resource settings.

Ambulatory short-course high-dose oral amoxicillin for treatment of severe pneumonia in children: a randomised DM in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Qazi SA ; New Outpatient Short-Course Home Oral Therapy for Severe Pneumonia Study Group . Children's Hospital, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan. BACKGROUND: WHO case management guidelines for severe pneumonia involve referral to hospital for treatment with parenter al antibiotics. If equally as eff ective as parenteral treatment, home-based oral antibiotic treat ment could reduce referral, ad mission, and treatment costs. Our aim was to determine whether home treatment with high-dose oral amoxicillin and inpatient treatment with parenteral ampicillin were equivalent for the treatment of severe pneumonia in children. METHODS: This randomised, open-label equivalency trial was done at seven study sites in Pakistan. 2037 children aged 3-59 months with severe pneumonia were randomly allocated to either initial hospitalisation a nd parenteral ampicillin (100 mg/kg per day in four doses) for 48 h, followed by 3 days of oral amoxicillin (80-90 mg/kg per day; n=1012) or to 5 days with oral amoxicillin (80-90 mg/kg per day in two doses; n=1025). Follow-up assessments were done at 1, 3, 6, and 14 days after enrollment. The primary outcome was treatment fa ilure (clinical deterioration) by day 6. Analyses were done per protocol and by intention to treat. This tria l is registered, ISRCTN 95821329. FINDINGS: In the per-protocol population, 36 individu als were excluded from the hospitalised group and 37 from the ambulatory group, mainly because of protocol violations or loss to follow-up. There were 87 (8.6%) treatment failures in the hospitalised gr oup and 77 (7.5%) in the ambulatory group (risk difference 1.1%; 95% CI -1.3 to 3.5) by day 6. Fi ve (0.2%) children died within 14 days of enrollment, one in the ambulatory group and f our in the hospitalised group. In each case, treatment failure was declared before death a nd the antibiotic had been changed. None of the deaths were considered to be associated with treatment allocation; there were no serious adverse events reported in the trial. INTERPRETATION: Home treatment with high-dose oral amoxicillin is equivalent to currently recommended hospitalisation and parenteral ampicillin for treatment of severe pneumonia without underlying complications , suggesting that WHO recommendations for treatment of severe pneumonia need to be revised. Comment A high proportion of children in this study had wheeze, suggesti ng respiratory viral infection was a common cause of illness. Also the probab ility of death was much lower (0.2%) than other studies of severe pneumonia (5-16%). Both thes e factors indicate the need for caution in extrapolating to high mortality regions, or regions with high HIV prevalence without further data. Trop Med Int Health. 2007 Nov;12(11):1377-85. Epidemiology and clinical features of pneumonia according to radiographic findings in Gambian children. F trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Medical Research Council La boratories, Fajara, The Gambia. enwereg@who.int OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of vaccines against pneumonia in Gambian children. METHODS: Data from a randomized, controlled trial of a 9-va lent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) were used. Radiographic finding s, interpreted using WHO definitions, were classified as primary end point pneumonia, 'other infiltrates/abnormalities' pneumonia and pneumonia with no abnormality. We calculated the incidence of the different types of radiological pneumonia, and compared clinical and laboratory features between these groups. RESULTS: Among children who did not receive PCV, the incidence of pneumonia with no radiographic abnormality was about twice that of 'other infiltrates' pneumonia and three times that of primary endpoint pneumonia. Most respiratory symptoms, reduced feeding and vomiting occurred most frequently in children with pr imary endpoint pneumonia. These children were more likely to be malnourished, to have bronchial breath sounds or invasi ve bacterial diseases, and to die within 28 days of consultation than ch ildren in the other group s. Conversely, a history of convulsion, diarrhoea or fast breathing, malaria parasitaemia and isolation of salmonellae were commoner in children w ith pneumonia with no radiographic abnormality. Lower chest wall indrawing and rhonchi on ausc ultation were seen 'other infiltrates/abnormalities' pneum onia. CONCLUSION: Primary e ndpoint pneumonia is strongly associated with bacterial aetio logy and severe pneumonia. Sin ce this category of pneumonia is significantly reduced after vaccination with Hib and pneumococcal vaccines, the risk-benefit of antimicrobial prescription for clinical pneumonia for children with increased respiratory rate may warrant re-examination once these vaccines are in widespread use.

Department of International Health, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. ccoles@jhsph.edu BACKGROUND: Zinc is undergoing evaluation as an inexpe nsive therapeutic adjuvant for severe pediatric pneumonia. OBJECTIVE: We expl ored the effect of etiology on the treatment effect of zinc in young children hospitalized for severe pneumonia. DESIGN: We analyzed data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted at the Christian Medical College Hospital, a teaching hospital in Tamilnadu, India. Children aged 2-23 mo (n = 299) were randomly assigned to receive a 10-mg tablet of zinc sulfate or placebo twice a day during hospitalization. The primary outcomes we re length of hospitalization and time to resolution of severe pneumonia stratified by etiologic classifi cation on the basis of serum C- reactive protein (CRP) concentrations at ad mission. RESULTS: CRP concentrations were available for 295 (98.7%) of the enrolled cases. Of these 295 cases, 223 (75.6%) were classified as suspected nonbacterial pneumonias (CRP concentrations <or=40 mg/L). Etiology modified the treatment effect of zinc on the length of th e hospital stay [hazard ratio (HR) for interaction term: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.91; P = suspected bacterial cases (CRP concentrations >40 mg/L), the median length of hospitalization was a pproximately 20 h longer 8Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 in the zinc-supplemented group than in the placebo group respectively; HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.93; P = 0.025). The treatment effect was not modified in the suspected nonbacterial cases of pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Ou r results suggest that the treatment effect of zinc for severe pediatric pneumonia may be modified by bacterial in fection. Further studies are required to develop appropria te recommendations for the use of zinc in the treatment of severe pneumonia. This trial was regi stered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00198666. Comment The validity of this study is based on the pred ictive value of C-reactive protein for bacterial pneumonia. Another study in 2008 showed children with bacterial pneumonia were significantly more likely to have serum CRP concentrations exceeding 35-60 mg/L than children with nonbacterial infections (odds ratio = 2.58, 95% confidence interval = 1.20-5.55). In children with pneumonia, serum CRP concentrations exceeding 40-60 mg/L weakly predict a bacterial ( Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2008 Feb;27:95-9). However CRP should not be relied upon to make decision about whether a child with pneumonia should receive antibiotics or not. Arch Dis Child. 2007 Nov;92(11):976-9. Epub 2007 Jun 26. Impact of HIV-1 status on the radiologic al presentation and clinical outcome of children with WHO defined community-acquired severe pneumonia. Jeena PM , Minkara . Department of KwaZulu-Natal, Congella, Durban, South Africa. jeena@ukzn.ac.za AIMS: We compared the radiological features and outcome of WHO defined severe pneumonia among HIV infected and exposed uninfected childre n randomised to receive penicillin or oral amoxicillin in Durban, South Africa. METHOD S: Of 425 children aged between 3 and 59 months with WHO defined severe pneumoni a, 366 had anonymous HIV testing performed. Outcome was assessed by failure to improve at 48 h after enrolment or deterioration within 14 days. Chest radiographs were evaluated accordin g to WHO defined radiological criteria for pneumonia and internationally standardised radi ological criteria. Finding s were stratified for HIV status. RESULTS: 82 (22.4%) children were HIV infected, 40 (10.9%) were HIV exposed and 244 (66.7%) were HIV uninfected. The day 14 outcome in children <12 months of age was significantly worse in HIV-1 in fected than HIV uninfected ch ildren (OR 2.8 (95% CI 1.35 to 3.5), p = 0.002), while HIV-1 infected and uninf ected children aged > or =12 months had equivalent outcomes. Parental penicillin and oral amoxicillin had e quivalent response rates in all HIV groups. According to the WHO radiologi cal classification, ch ildren who failed WHO standard antimicrobial treatment had significantly higher \"other consolidates /infiltrates\" than \"endpoints for consolidation\" in the HIV group (OR 5.45 (95% CI 1.58 to 21.38), p<0.002), while the reverse was true for HIV e xposed uninfected children (OR 4.13 (95% CI 0.88 to 20.57), p<0.036). CONCLUSIONS: The WHO standard treatment guideline for severe pneumonia is inadequate for HIV-1 inf ected infants. The increased prevalence of \"other consolidates/infiltrate s\" among HIV-1 infected children who failed standard treatment supports the addition of co-tr imoxazole to WHO standard treatment. 9Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Anaemia (See also Nutrition) Cad Saude Publica. 2007 Jul;23(7):1547-52. Effectiveness of different iron supplementation strategies on hemoglobin and ferritin levels among schoolchildren in Teresina, Piau \u00ed State, Brazil Dos Santos MM Diniz study evaluated the effectiveness of ementation with ferrous sulfate and iron bis- glycinate chelate on hemoglobin and serum ferritin levels among (7-11 years) of both sexes. A randomized community-based tria l including 138 anemic children (hemoglobin < 11.5 g/dL) was conducted in Teresina, Piau\u00ed State, Brazil. Children were assigned to two treatment groups on an individual basis. One group (n = 71) received 40 mg iron as ferrous sulfate once weekly and the other group (n = 67) received 3.8 mg of iron bis-glycinate chelate-enriched cookies, 3x/week, for 8 week s. The interventions showed a significant increase (p < 0.01) in hemoglobin levels (1.1g/d L) for children who rec eived ferrous sulfate and 0.9 g/dl in those who received iron bis-glycin ate chelate, although not significant in the inter-group comparison (p > 0.05). No effect was observed on body iron for either intervention (p > 0.05). Children with depleted iron stores (< 15 ng/mL) at the beginning of interventions showed increased serum ferritin co ncentrations after 8 weeks (p < 0.01), although no difference between treatments (p > 0.05) was obs erved. The results confirm the effectiveness of the iron supplementation interventions and corroborate the use of iron salts or ferrous bisglycinate chelate on a weekly basis to overcome iron deficiency and anemia.

Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India. ghaibabita@hotmail.com BACKGROUND: The purpose of th e study was to compare the succe ss and ease of insertion of three techniques of laryngeal mask airway (LMA ) insertion; the standard Brain technique, a lateral technique with cuff partially inflated and a rotational technique with cuff partially inflated. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-eight ASA I and II children aged 6 months to 6 years undergoing short elective su rgical procedures lasting 40-60 min were included in the study. A standard anesthesia protocol was follo wed for all patients. Patients were randomly allocated into one of the three groups i.e. sta ndard (S), rotational (R ) and lateral (L). The primary outcome measure of the study was succ ess rate at the first attempt using three techniques of LMA insertion. Secondary outcomes measures studied were overall success rate, time before successful LMA insertion, complications and maneuvers used to relieve airway obstruction. RESULTS: Successful insertion at the first attemp t was significantly higher in group R (96%) compared with group L (84%) and group S (80%) (P = 0.03). Overall success rate (i.e. successful inserti on with two attempts) was 100% for group R, 93% for group L and 87% for group S (P = 0.03). Time for successful insertion was significantly lower in group R compared with group L and S (P < 0.001). The in cidence of complications was lower in group R. CONCLUSIONS: A rotational tec hnique with partially inflated cuff is associated with the highest success rate of insertion and lowest incidence of complications and could be the technique of first choice for LMA insertion in pediatric patients. 11Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 J Clin Pediatr Dent. 2007 Fall;32(1):1-4. Sedation in uncooperative children undergoing dental procedures: a comparative evaluation of midazolam, propofol and of Pedodontics and Preventive Children Dentistry, A.B. Shetty Memorial Institute of Dental Sciences, Mangalore, Karnataka, India. Dentists usually face a common problem dealing with pediatric patients due to their high levels of anxiety and fear, associated with dental procedures. Such children are usually managed by various pharmacological methods. The efficacy and safety of conscious sedation, using intravenous short acting group of drugs (midazolam, propofol and ketamine) in uncooperative children, requiring oral rehabi litation was thus evaluated in this study. A total of 30 uncooperative children, aged 3-6 years, belonging to ASA I, II category formed the study group. The efficacy of the three group of drugs was ev aluated on the basis of the onset of sedation, duration of action, side effects encountered, and the overall coopera tive behavior of the child throughout the course of the procedure, after obta ining parental consent. Results showed that propofol was highly effective in terms of onset of sedation, although increased body movements and crying, pain on injection and intermittent cough was observed as the main side effects of the drug. Midazolam showed the longest duration of ac tion, but was not very e ffective in terms of treatment completion due to in creased movements and crying. Maximum cooperation during the procedure was obtained with ketamine and no ad verse effects were encountered. We preferred ketamine from the results of our study and r ecommended future evaluation of ketamine in combination with other sedatives. J Paediatr Child Health. 2008 Apr;44(4):201-4.

Department of Anaesthesia, Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. AIM: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a mixture of ketamine, midazolam and atropine given orally by comparing the same mixture gi ven through the intramuscu lar route in children with malignancy undergoing minor invasive pr ocedures. METHODS: Sixty children, aged between 1 and 10 years, scheduled to undergo mi nor procedures were randomised into two groups to receive a mixture of ketamine (6 mg /kg), midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) and atropine intramuscularly or ketamine (10 mg/kg), midazo lam (0.2 mg/kg) and atropine (0.05 mg/kg) orally (Group 2). Sedation score, ob server-rated visual anal ogue scale for pain were noted by an observer blinded to the ro ute of drug administration. RESULTS: Optimum 12Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 sedation was present in all child ren in both groups after drug ad ministration, with Group 1 being more deeply sedated than Group 2 at the st art of the procedure. Supplementation with intravenous ketamine was require d in four children in Group 1 and eight children in Group 2 (P = 0.33). The mean (+/-SD) observe r-rated visual analogue scale for pain during the procedure was 8.33 (+/-15.99) and 9.33 (+/-16.39) in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively (P = 0.892). One patient in Group 1 had vomiting after the procedure. There were no differences in proportion of patients with hallucinations and nystagmus in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: A mixture of ketamine, midazolam and atropine given orally provides sedation and analgesia similar to that produced by the same drugs given intramuscularl y. It offers advantage over the intramuscular route as it is painless and can be given for minor paediatric oncology procedures with appropriate monitoring. Anaesthesia. 2007 Nov;62(11):1110-3. A prospective randomised double blind study to evaluate the effect of peribulbar block or topical application of local anaesthesia combined with general anaesthesia on intra-operative and postoperative complications Maulana Azad Medical College and associated Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi-110002, India. drnishkarsh@rediffmail.com We studied 45 ASA I/II children aged between 2 and 13 years scheduled for elective strabismus surgery, randomly allocated to receive either a peribulbar block or topical lidocaine 2% combined with general anaesthesia, or general an aesthesia alone. The incidence and severity of the occulocardiac reflex, the requirement for atropine, the occurrenc e of arrhythmias and incidence of postoperative naus ea and vomiting following surgery at 1, 2 and 4 h were studied. We found the incidence and severity of occulocar diac reflex intra-operat ively was significantly reduced in children who received a peribulbar block. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was significantly reduced in patients re ceiving either peribulbar block or topical local anaesthesia combined with general anaesthesia, compared to general anaesthesia alone (p = 0.008).

INTERVENTION: The experime ntal group received a single standardised suctioning procedure followed five minutes later by a standardised recruitment manoeuvre. The control group received only the single suctioning procedure. OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements of ventilation (dynamic lung co mpliance, expiratory airway resistance, mechanical and spontaneous expired tidal volume, respiratory rate) and gas exchange (transcutaneous oxygen saturation) were reco rded, on three occasions before and on two occasions after the recruitmen t manoeuvre, using a respiratory profile monitor. RESULTS: There was no difference between the expe rimental and the control group in dynamic compliance, expired airway resistance, or oxygen saturation either immediately after the recruitment manoeuvre, or after 25 minutes. Th e experimental group decreased mechanical expired tidal volume by 0.3 ml/kg (95% CI 0.1 to 0.6), increased spontaneous expired tidal volume by 0.3 ml/kg (95% CI 0.0 to 0.6), and increased total respir atory rate by 3 bpm (95% CI 1 to 4) immediately after the recruitment manoe uvre compared with the control group, but these differences disappeared after 25 minutes. CONCLUSION: There is insufficient evidence to support performing recruitment manoeuvres after suctioning infants and children Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol. 2007 Nov;71(11):1687-92.

Division of Otolaryngology, University of Cape Town, South Africa. nicojonas@gmail.com OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiven ess oxymetazoline 0.025% compared to 0.025% administered pr ior to fibreoptic nasendoscopy in paediatric patients. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, randomized controlled, double-blind study. A group of 56 children, undergoing nasend oscopy to determine adenoidal size, were randomized into A tertiary care Paediatric Hospital. METHOD: The endoscopist recorded the ease of performance of the procedure, cooperation of patient and quality of the view achieved using a visual analogue scale (VAS). The pain and anxiety levels of the child were recorded before, during and immediately after the procedure, using a VAS . The duration of performing the procedure was recorded from insertion of the endoscope into the nostril until rem oval. RESULTS: All 56 children were able to undergo the endoscopy and the full anxiety and pain assessment was done. Three children were excluded because they have undergone na sendoscopies before. Of the 53 patients included, 27 children received solution A (oxymetazolin e 0.025%) and 26 children received solution B (oxymetazoline 0.025% and lignocain 2%). There wa s no statistical difference between the two groups regarding the duration of the endoscopy, quality of view, ease of performance and 14Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 cooperation of the patients. The median pain and anxiety scores were not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study concludes that the us e of a decongestant (oxymetazoline) for paediatric nasendoscopy is just as effective as th e use of oxymetazoline with lignocain. Pain and anxiety is no t increased in the absence of lignocain. Asthma Fam Process. 2008 Mar;47(1):115-30. Incorporating family therapy into intervention: waitlist-controlled Wan PY , Chan DF . Centre on Behavioral Health, University of Hong Kong, G/F Pauline Chan Bldg., 10 Sassoon Rd., Pokfulam, Hong Kong, China. ngsiuman@hku.hk Asthma psychoeducational programs have been found to be effective in terms of symptom- related outcome. They are mostly illness-focused, and pay minimal attention to systemic/familial factors. This study evaluate d a novel asthma psychoeducation program that adopted a parallel group design and incorpor ated family therapy. A randomized waitlist- controlled crossover clinical trial design was adopted. Children w ith stable asthma and their parents were recruited from a pediatric ches t clinic. Outcome measures included, for the patients: exhaled nitric oxide (e NO), spirometry, and adjustment to asthma; and for the parents: perceived efficacy in asthma management, Ho spital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety subscale, Body Mind Spirit Well-being Inventory emotion subscale, and Short Form 12 health- related quality of life scale. Forty-six patients participated in the st udy. Attrition rates were 13.0% and 26.0% for the active and control gr oups, respectively. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a significant decrease in airway infl ammation, as indicated by eNO levels, and an increase in patient's adjustment to asthma and parents' perceived efficacy in asthma management. Serial trend analys is revealed that most psychos ocial measures continued to progress steadily after inte rvention. Significant improvements in both symptom-related measures and mental health and relationship m easures were observed. The findings supported the value of incorporating family thera py into asthma psychoeducation programs. Indian Pediatr. 2008 Mar;45(3):225-8.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of all type s of spacers commonly available to children in India. METHODS: 150 children 5-14 yr of age with persistent asthma presenting with peak expiratory flow (PEF) < 70% of person al best were randomized to receive 200 mg salbutamol through one of five spacers: A) 750 ml spacer with valve, B) 165 ml spacer with valve, C) 250 ml spacer without valve, D) 1000 ml indigenously made spacer without valve and E) 500 ml indigenously made spacer without valve. PEF measurement was repeated 15 minutes later. Children> 8 yr old performed spirom etry in addition to PEF. Absolute change and percentage improvement of PEF and FEV1 were compared among the groups. RESULTS: Subjects in all groups had comparable baseline demographic characteristics and PEF. All showed significant improvement in PEF and FEV1 over baseline values. The change in PEF and percentage improvement were comparable among all five groups (p=0.780 and p=0.955 respectively). Likewise change in FEV1 and pe rcentage improvement were also comparable. The five groups showed no difference in efficacy , irrespective of severi ty of baseline airway obstruction. CONCLUSION: The five spacers were equally efficacious for the delivery of bronchodilator in children with moderate persiste nt asthma presenting with airway obstruction.

Cano-Garcinu\u00f1o A , Palencia, Spain. acanog@compalencia.org 16Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 OBJECTIVE: To establish the efficacy in term s of morbidity and quali ty of life of a group education program on asthma aimed at children and caregivers. METHODS: An open, randomized, controlled trial was undertaken in 13 primary health care centers in Spain, Cuba, and Uruguay and involved 245 children with acti ve asthma aged 9 to 13 years and their caregivers. The intervention consisted of 3 edu cational sessions lasting 45 to 60 minutes each and was performed with 3 intervention groups : children alone, caregivers alone, and both children and caregivers. The outcome measures were difference between intervention and control groups in the rate of asthma attacks and hosp ital admission, as well as the quality of life of children and caregivers in the 6 months following the intervention. RESULTS: The rate of asthma attacks per patient-year decreased when the intervention was given only to children (mean difference, -1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.87 to -0.34) or to children and caregivers (-1.60; 95% CI, -2.88 to -0.31). Hospital admissions per pa tient-year decreased in the intervention groups children alone (-0.28; 95% CI, -0.51 to -0.05) and both children and caregivers (-0.25; 95% CI, -0.49 to -0.02). Education provided to caregivers alone was not associated with any changes in morbidity. No di fferences were observed in terms of quality of life between controls and any of the intervention groups . CONCLUSIONS: Group education on asthma reduces morbidity but does not improve quali ty of life. The benefits are apparent when education is aimed at children but no additional benefit is obtain ed if the intervention is also aimed at their caregivers. Finally, group educati on for adult caregivers al one is not effective. J Trop Pediatr. 2007 Oct;53(5):325-30. Epub 2007 Jul 10. Montelukast vs. inhaled low-dose budesoni de as monotherapy in the treatment of mild persistent asthma: a rando mized double blind controlled Ansari Nagar, Delhi 110029, India. BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend daily contro ller therapy for mild persistent asthma. Montelukast has demonstrated consistent benefit in controlling symptoms of asthma and may be an alternative, orally administered, nonsteroidal agent for tr eating mild asthma. Aim: To determine whether montelukast is as effective as budesonide in controlling mild persistent asthma as determined by FEV(1). METHODS: Between November 2003 to October 2005, participants aged 5-15 years with recently diagnosed mild persistent asthma (n = 62) were randomized to oral montelukast (5 mg daily) [N (1) = 30] or inhaled budesonide (400 microg per day in two doses) [N(2) = 32] in a singl e center, double-blind study. RESULTS: Baseline demographic and spirometric parameters were comparable. The median (95% confidence interval) percentage predicted FEV(1) was simila r in the two groups afte r 12 weeks of treatment (budesonide: 76.70 (67.96-90.53%), monteluka st: 75 (67.40-88.47)%; p = 0.44). There was similar improvement in spirometric parameters and clinical symptom sc ores in both the groups. There was no statistically signifi cant difference between the groups in the need for rescue drugs as well as side effects reported by parents. CONCLUSION: Montelukast is as effective as inhaled budesonide in the treatmen t of mild persistent asthma in children aged 5-15 years. Montelukast may be used as an alternative to low dose inhaled corticosteroids for management of mild persistent asthma Respir Med. 2007 Oct;101(10):2182-91.

Lack of efficacy of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in patients with dengue virus infection. Dimaano EM of Blood Borne Diseases, San Lazaro Hospital, Manila, Research and Biotechnology Division, St. Luke's Medica l Center, Quezon City, The Philippines . Because most cases of secondary dengue virus inf ection are associated with an increased level of platelet-associated IgG, a high dose of in travenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may have an effect on the development of severe thrombocytopenia in this disease. A randomized, controlled study was conducted with two trea tment groups consisting of a treatment (IVIG) group (n = 15) and a non-treatment (non-IVIG) group (n = 16) to determine whether a high dose of IVIG is effective in hasten ing the recovery from thrombocytopenia in patients with secondary dengue virus infe ction. No significant difference was found in the baseline demographic data between the two groups. No adverse effect of IVIG was observed, but no effect in hastening the recovery of platelet co unts was found in patients with secondary dengue infections. The lack of efficacy of IVIG suggests that platelet clearance by macrophages through Fc gamma receptors is not a primary mechanism in this disease. 19Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Diarrhoea (see also zinc) Pediatrics. 2008 May;121(5):e1279-85. Effectiveness of zinc supplementation plus oral rehydration salts compared with oral rehydration salts alone as a treatm ent for acute diarrhea in a primary care setting: a cluster randomized trial. New Delhi 110017, India. community.research@cih.uib.no OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to evaluate whether education about zinc supplements and provision of zinc supplements to caregivers is effectiv e in the treatment of acute diarrhea and whether this strategy advers ely affects the use of oral rehydration salts. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six cl usters of 30,000 people each in Haryana, India, were randomly assigned to intervention and control sites. Government and private providers and village health workers were trained to prescribe zinc and oral rehydration salts for use in diarrheal episodes in 1-month-old to 5-year-old children in interven tion communities; in the control sites, oral rehydr ation salts alone was promoted. In 2 cross-sectional surveys commencing 3 months (survey 2) and 6 months (survey 3) after the start of the intervention, care-seeking behavior, drug thera py, and oral rehydration salts us e during diarrhea, diarrheal and respiratory morbidity, and hospitaliza tion rates were measured. RESULTS: In the 2 surveys, zinc was used in 36.5% (n = 1571) and 59.8% (n = 1649) and rehydration salts 34.8% (n = 1571) and 59.2% (n = 1649) of diarrheal episodes occurring in the 4 weeks preceding interviews in the intervention areas. In control areas, oral rehydration salts were used in 7.8% (n = 2209) and 9.8% (n = 2609) of episodes. In the intervention communities, care seeking for diarrhea reduced by 34% (survey 3), as did the prescription of drugs of unknown identity (survey 3) and antibiotics (survey 3) for diarrhea. The 24- hour prevalences of diarrhea and acute low er respiratory infections were lower in the intervention communities (survey 3). All-caus e, diarrhea, and pneumonia hospitalizations in the preceding 3 months were reduced in th e intervention compared with control areas (survey 3). CONCLUSIONS: Diarrhea is more effec tively treated when caregivers receive education on zinc supplementation and have ready access to supplies of oral rehydration salts and zinc, and this approach does not adversely affect the use of oral rehydration salts; in fact, it greatly increases use of the same. Comment This important effectiveness study showed a concerningly low rate of utilization of ORS when children have diarrhoea. This rate of ORS use c an be improved by training health workers in how to prescribe zinc also. Therefore, far from making the management of diarrhoea more complex, the addition of zinc in this large I ndian population improved access to quality curative 20Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 care for diarrhoea, and reduced the prescription of ineffective treatments . Overall health was improved, and this study provided some evidence that giving zinc as par t of case management for diarrhoea will reduce respiratory infections also. Countries that are struggling with whether to introduce zinc as routine supplem entation for the entire population should first introduce zinc as standard treatment for diarrhoea. Evidence suggests this is likely to also have preventative impacts on other diseases. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2008 Feb;78(2):214-6. Effect of Saccharomyces boulardii in the treatment of acute watery diarrhea in Myanmar children: a randomized controlled study. Htwe K Tin M , Vandenplas Y . Department of Child Health, North Okkalapa General Hospital, University of Medicine, Yangon, Myanmar. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Saccharomyces boulardi i in acute diarrhea. One hundred hospitalized children in Myanmar (a ge range = 3 months to 10 years) were included. Fifty were treated with S. boulardii for five days in addition to oral rehydration solution (ORS) and 50 were given ORS alone (contro l group) in an alternating order. The mean duration of diarrhea was 3.08 days in the S. boulardii group and 4.68 days (P < 0.05) in the control group. Stools had a normal consistency on day 3 in 38 (76%) of 50 patients in the S. boulardii group compared with only 12 (24%) of 50 in the control group (P = 0.019). On day 2, 27 (54%) of 50 had less than three stools per da y in the S. boulardii group compared with only 15 (30%) of 50 in the control group (P = 0.019). Saccharomyces boulardii shortens the duration of diarrhea and normalizes stool consistency and frequency. The s hortening of the duration of diarrhea results in a soci al and economic benefits.

RESULTS: The study comprised of 235 patients randomized into 2 groups, cases (117) and contro ls (118). Both the groups were similar with respect to age, number of breas tfed infants, presentation with dehydration, degree of protein energy malnutrition, and distribut ion of infections. Stool cult ure was positive in 90 (38.3%) patients, Escherichia coli be ing the commonest organism followed by Shigella spp. and Clostridium difficile. The mean duration of diarrhea was significantly lower in the cases than in controls (5.3 vs. 9.2 d). The average dur ation of hospital stay was also significantly lesser in cases. No complication was observed from the dose of LGG used. CONCLUSIONS: LGG (dose of 60 million cells) c ould decrease the frequency and duration of diarrhea and vomiting and reduced hospital stay in patients of PD.

METHODS: This was a single-blind, randomized c linical trial in which 330 patients were randomly assigned to receive buccal midazolam or rectal diazepam . The trial was conducted in the pediatric emergency unit of the national referral hospital of Uganda. Consecutive patients who were aged 3 months to 12 years and presented while convulsing or who experienced a seizure that lasted >5 minutes were randomly assign ed to receive buccal midazolam plus rectal placebo or rectal diazepam plus buccal placebo. The primary outcome of this study was cessation of visible seizure activity within 10 minutes without recurrence in the subsequent hour. RESULTS: Treatment failures occurred in 71 (43.0%) of 165 patients who received rectal diazepam compared with 50 (30.3 %) of 165 patients who received buccal midazolam. Malaria was the most common underlying diagnosis (67.3%), although the risk for failure of treatment for malaria-related seiz ures was similar: 35.8% for rectal diazepam compared for buccal midazolam. For children without malaria, buccal midazolam superior (55.9% vs 26.5%). Respiratory de pression occurred uncommonly in both of the treatment arms. CONCLUSION: Buccal midazolam was as safe as and more effective than rectal diazepam for the treatment of seizures in Ugandan children, although benefits were limited to children without malaria.

The median time to control refractory stat us epilepticus was less in the valproate group (5 minutes) than the diazepam group (1 7 minutes; P < .001). None of the patients in the valproate group required ventilation or developed hypotension, whereas in the diazepam group 60% required ventilation and 50% developed hypotension after starting diazepam infusion . No adverse effects on liver functions were seen with valproate. It is concluded that intravenous sodium valproate is an effective alte rnative to diazepam infusion in controlling refractory status epilep ticus in children and is free of respiratory depression and hypotension.

Epub 2007 Jul 9. 25Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Randomized study of intravenous Unit, College, Kanpur 208002, India. pgpuneet@gmail.com INTRODUCTION: The evidence based data to gui de management in patients of benzodiazepine refractory status epilepticus (S E) is still lacking. We conducte d a randomized study to evaluate the comparative effect of intravenous (IV) phe nytoin and intravenous valproate (IV VA) in patients of benzodiazepine refractory SE . BACKGROUND AND MET HODS: Hundred, age and sex matched, patients of benzodiazepine refr actory SE were randomly divided into Group A (50 patients), treated with IV VA and Group B ( 50 patients) treated with IV phenytoin. Twelve patients, in whom SE was not controlled with a single drug, were switc hed over to the other group. Treatment was considered successful when all motor or EEG seizure activity ceased within 20 min after the beginning of the drug in fusion and no return of seizure activity during the next 12h. Secondary study end points were adverse events to treatment, in-hospital complications and the neurological outcome at discharge. RESULTS: In this study, IV VA was successful in 88% and IV phenyto in in 84% (p>0.05) of patients of SE with a significantly better response in patients of SE <2h (p<0.05). The total number of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups (p>0 .05). There were no differences among the treatments with respect to recurrence after 12-h study period or the outcome at 7 days. CONCLUSION: IV VA is as effective as IV phenytoi n. It is easy to use, better tolerated and can be used as an alternative to IV phenytoin in patients of benzodiazepine refractory SE, especially in patients of cardio-respiratory disease. The better outcome in patients having shorter duration of SE (<2h) suggests need of immediate treatment. Comment The above two studies compared intravenous sodi um valproate with intravenous diazepam and phenytoin for the management of status epilepti cus. Valproate was found to be much more effective and safer than IV diaze pam, and marginally better than IV phenytoin. The high rate of respiratory depression and hypotension with intra venous diazepam confirms giving diazepam as an IV infusion is very dangerous. This is similar to the findings of a prev ious trial in Kenya. Another study this year in Ugandan children with status epilepticus showed buccal midazolam was as effective as rectal diaze pam. Putting these 3 trials togeth er it can be concluded that IV phenytoin, IV valproate or buccal midazolam are e ffective and safe in th e treatment of status epilepticus. If diazepam must be used it should not be given as an IV infusion. Fever Indian Pediatr. 2007 Dec;44(12):903-11. Role of paracetamol in treatment of childhood Fever: a double-blind randomized placebo controlled trial. 26Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Gupta H , Shah D , Gupta P , Sharma KK . Department of Pediatrics, University College of Medical Sciences and GTB Hospital, Dilshad Garden, Delhi 110 095, India. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether paracetam ol administration (i) increases the overall duration of fever; and (ii) is effective and safe, in symptomatic treatment of febrile children. DESIGN: Randomized double blind placebo contro lled trial. METHODS: The trial was conducted at a tertiary care set ting. 210 febrile children (6 months - 6 years) with uncomplicated respiratory tract infection rece ived oral paracetamol (15 mg /kg) or placebo, if axillary temperature was 37.6C. Outcome measures incl uded fever clearance time, rate of fall of temperature, percent reduction of temperature, proportion of afebrile children, symptomatic improvement (based on categorical improvement in activity, alertness mood, comfort, appetite and fluid intake) and clinical and biochemical adverse effects. RESULTS: Fever clearance time [median (SE, 95% CI)] was comparable between the two groups 32 (2, 22-37) h; placebo: 36 resulted in signif deg 31.9-47.9; P<0.001) during first four hours after drug administration. Proportion of afebrile children after 4 hours (paracetamol: 46.6%; placebo: 12.1%; P < 0.001) and symptomatic improve ment at 6 hours were significantly higher (P<0.001) after administrati on of paracetamol as compared to placebo. No serious clinical or biochemical advers e drug effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Paracetamol achieves effective antipyresis a nd provides early symptomatic improvement in children with febrile illness without prolongation of fever duration or excessive adverse effects. Malar J. 2008 May 26;7:91 Antipyretic effect of ibuprofen in Schweitzer Hospital, Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9, Gabon. matsiegpb@yahoo.fr BACKGROUND: Antipyretic drugs are widely used in children with fever, though there is a controversy about the benefit of reducing fever in child ren with malaria. In order to assess the effect of ibuprofen on fever compared to placeb o in children with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Gabon, a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial, was designed. METHODS: Fifty children between two and seve n years of age with uncomplicated malaria were included in the study. For the treatment of fever, all patients \"received\" mechanical treatment when the temperature rose above 37.5 degrees C. In addition to the mechanical treatment, continuous fanning and cooling blanket, patients were assigned randomly to receive ibuprofen (7 mg/kg body weight, every eight hours) or placebo. RESULTS: The fever clearance time using a fever threshold of 37.5 degrees C was similar in children receiving ibuprofen compared to those receiving pla cebo. The difference was also not statistically significant using a fever thres hold of 37.8 degrees C or 38.0 degrees C. However, the fever 27Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 time and the area under the fever curve were si gnificantly smaller in the ibuprofen group compared to the placebo group. CONCLUSION: Ibuprofen is eff ective in reducing the time with fever. The effect on fever clearance is less obvious and depends on definition of the fever threshold.

Rizzo JA , beyond sub-Sahara n Africa, the World Health Organization's recommended strategy for interrupting transmission of the causative paras ites is annual, single- dose, mass treatment with a combination of diet hylcarbamazine (DEC; given at 6 mg/kg) and albendazole (ALB; given at 400 mg) for 4-6 years (the minimum estimated life-span of the adult parasites). In an open, hospital-based, randomized and controlled trial, with a blinded evaluation of outcome, 82 children and adolescents from Recife, all with Wuchereria bancrofti microfilaraemias, were given either DEC alone (6 mg/kg) or the same dose of DEC combined with ALB (at 400 mg/patient). Every 90 days for 1 year after the single treatment, each patient was checked for microfilaraemia by the filtration of up to 5 ml of venous blood collected at night. One year post-treatment, 16 (39%) of the 41 patients given DEC alone and 20 (49%) of the 41 given DEC-ALB were found microfilaraemi c (relative risk=0.8, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.49-1.31) and the correspondi ng geometric mean levels of microfilaraemia were 2.0% and 1.8% of the levels recorded immediately pre-treatment, respectively (P>0.05). In terms of the prevalences and inte nsities of microfilaraemia, therefore, the addition of ALB to the DEC appear ed to offer no significant benefit.

In a small study in eastern Sudan, th e effects of the treatment of uncomplicated, Plasmodium falciparum ma laria therefore investigated. Faecal samples from 14 of the 306 patients screened on presentation, at the st art of a clinical tria l of antimalarial treatment, were found to contain Schistosoma mansoni eggs. For the treatment of their malaria, the 14 egg-positive cases, who were aged 6-40 years (mean = 13.7 years), were each subsequently treated with three tablets of a fixed combination of AS-SMP, with a 12-h (six patients) or 24-h interval (five patients) between each tablet, or with six doses of AT-LU given over 3 days. When checked 28 and 29 days after the initiation of treatment, all 14 patient s were found stool-negative for schistosome eggs. These results indicate that AS-S MP and AT-LU are currently very effective treatments not only for uncomplicated, P. falciparum malaria but also for S. mansoni infections.

The study involves four matched village pairs in Hunan and Jia ngxi Provinces, with a village within each pair randomly selected as intervention (human and bovine praziquantel treatment) or control (human praziquantel treatment only). Tota l study population prevalences at baseline were 12.4% (n = 5,390) and 15.2% (n = 1,573) for humans and bovines, respectively; 29Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 village prevalences were similar within pairs. Bovine contamination index calculations showed that bovines less than 24 months of age were responsible for 74% of daily bovine environmental contamination with S. japonicum eggs. The village characteristics and baseline results underpin a rigorous study, which has major implications for deployment of a transmission-blocking bovine vaccine against S. japonicum. The combination of such a vaccine with other control strategies could potentiall y eliminate S. japonicum from southern China.

METHODS: Data from two consecutive prevention of HIV transmission programs were compared: the ANRS 1201/1202 Ditrame-Plus cohor 049a Ditrame randomized trial and its foll owing open-labeled cohort (1995-2000), used as a reference group. HIV-infected pregnant women > or = 32-36 weeks of gestation were offered a short-course 48-72 h after birth. A 6-week pediatric HIV-RNA diagnosis was provided on-line in the Ditrame-Plus while it was only orient ed on clinical symptoms in Ditrame. Six-week HIV-infected children re ceived a daily cotrimoxazole Ditrame-Plus while no prophylaxis was provided in Ditrame. The de terminants of severe events (death or hospitalization > 1 day) were a ssessed in a Cox regression model. RESULTS: Between 1995 and 2003, 98 out of the 1121 live-births were diagnosed as HIV-infected in peri- partum: 45 Ditrame-Plus and 53 from D itrame. The 18-month Kaplan-Meier cumulative probability of presenting a severe event was 66 % in Ditrame-Plus (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: Log Rank test: p = 0.47. After adjustment on maternal WHO clinical stage, maternal death, 6-week pediatric viral load, birth-weight, and breastfeeding exposure, the 18-month risk of severe event was lower in Ditrame- Plus than in Ditrame (adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR): 0.55, 95%CI: 0.3-1.1), although the difference was not statistically significant; p = 0.07) . Maternal death was the only variable determinant of the occurrence of severe events in children (aHR: 3.73; CI: 2.2-11.2; p = 0.01). 30Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 CONCLUSION: Early cotrimoxazole from 6 weeks of age in HIV-infected infants seemed to reduce probability of severe events but the study lacked statistical power to prove this. Even with systematic cotrimoxazole prophylaxi s, infant morbidity and mortality remained high pointing towards a need for early pediatric HIV-diagnosis and antiretroviral treatment in Africa.

Use of Nutrition, Unilasalle, Brazil. liviatrois@gmail.com HIV/AIDS is an infection characterized by immune cell dysfunction and subsequent immunodeficiency, as well as intes tinal disorder. Probiotics are li ve microbial feed supplements that beneficially affect the host animal by improving intestinal microbial balance and promoting health benefits. The goals of this study were to determine whether the use of probiotics could improve the immune response determined by CD 4 cells mm(-3) counts and reduce liquid stool episodes. A randomized double-blind controlled trial with 77 HIV-inf ected children (2-12 years), divided into two groups : one receiving probiotics (for mula containing Bifidobacterium bifidum with Streptococcus thermophilus -2.5 x 10(10) colony forming units) and the other, a standard formula (control group), for 2 months. The CD4 counts (cells mm(-3)) were collected at the beginning and end of the study. The qua lity and number of stools were assessed by a questionnaire (watery to normal stool consistency). There was an increase in the mean CD4 count in the probiotics group (791 cells mm(-3 )) and a small decrease in the control group (538 cells mm(-3)). The change from baseline in mean CD4 cell count was +118 cells mm(- 3) vs. -42 cells mm(-3) for children receiving the probiotic formula and control formula, 31Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 respectively (p = 0.049). A similar reduction in liquid stool consistency in both the groups (p < 0.06), with a slight enhancement in the probio tics group, was observed, but without significant difference (p < 0.522). The incidence of loose- soft stools showed a small decrease in both groups (p < 0.955) and there was an increase in the incidence of normal stool consistency in both the groups (p < 0.01). Our study showed that probiotics have immunostimulatory properties and might be helpful in th e treatment of HIV-infected children. HIV education Am J Public Health. 2008 Feb;98(2):201-4.

Gertrude H. Sergievsky Center and the Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York 10032, USA. lk24@columbia.edu BACKGROUND: In low-resource settings, ma ny programs recommend that women who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) stop breas t-feeding early. We conducted a randomized trial to evaluate whether ab rupt weaning at 4 months as compared with the standard practice has a ne t benefit for HIV-free survival of children. METHODS: We enrolled 958 HIV-infected women and their infa nts in Lusaka, Zambia. All the women planned to breast-feed exclusively to 4 months; 481 were randomly assigned to a counseling program that encouraged abrupt weaning at 4 mont hs, and 477 to a program that encouraged continued breast-feeding for as long as the women chose. The primary outcome was either HIV infection or death of the child by 24 months. RESULTS: In the intervention group, 69.0% of the mothers stopped breast-feeding at 5 months or earlier; 68.8% of these women reported the completion of weaning in less than 2 days. In the control group, the median duration of breast-feeding was 16 months. In the overall cohort, there was no significant difference between the groups in the rate of HIV-free survival among th e children; 68.4% and 64.0% survived to 24 months without HIV inf ection in the interven tion and control groups, respectively (P=0.13). Among infants who were still being breast-fed and were not infected with HIV at 4 months, there was no si gnificant difference between the groups in HIV-free survival at 24 months (83.9% and 80.7% in the interven tion and control groups, respectively; P=0.27). Children who were infected with HIV by 4 mont hs had a higher mortality by 24 months if they had been assigned to the intervention gr oup than if they had been assigned to the control group (73.6 % vs. 54.8%, P=0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Early, abrupt cessation of breast-feeding by HIV-infected women in a low-resource setting, such as Lusaka, Zambia, does not improve the rate of HIV-free survival among children born to HIV-infected mothers and is harmful to HIV-infected infants. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00310726.) 2008 Massachusetts Medical Society Comment This is an important trial, adding to the eviden ce from Botswana published in 2006 showing that although formula feeding is associated with lowe r risk of mother-to-ch ild HIV transmission, it was associated with a higher mortality ( JAMA. 2006 Aug 16;296(7):794-805) This year we learn that in HIV-affected infants in Zambia, mo rtality is higher if ther e is abrupt weaning at 4 33Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 months of age.

Extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to reduce breast-milk HIV-1 transmission. MG , Taha TE . Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns H opkins University, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. BACKGROUND: Effective strategies are urge ntly needed to reduce mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency viru s type 1 (HIV-1) through breast-feeding in resource-limited settings. METHODS: Women wi th HIV-1 infection who were breast-feeding infants were enrolled in a randomize d, phase 3 trial in Blantyre, Malawi. At birth, the infants were randomly assigned to one of three regimens: single-dose nevirapine plus 1 week of zidovudine (control regimen) or the contro l regimen plus daily extended prophylaxis either with nevirapine (extende d nevirapine) or with nevirapi ne plus zidovudine (extended dual prophylaxis) until the age of 14 weeks. Using Kaplan-Meier analyses, we assessed the risk of HIV-1 infection among infants who were HIV-1-negative on DNA polymerase-chain-reaction assay at birth. RESULTS: Among 3016 infants in the study, the control group had consistently higher rates of HIV-1 infection from the age of 6 weeks through 18 months. At 9 months, the estimated rate of HIV-1 infectio n (the primary end point) was 10.6% in the control group, as compared with 5.2% in the extended-nevirapine group (P<0.001) and 6.4% in the extended-dual-prophylaxis group (P=0.002). There were no significant differences between the two ex tended-prophylaxis groups. The frequency of breast-feeding did not differ significantly among the study groups. Infa nts receiving extended dual prophylaxis had a significant increase in the number of adverse ev ents (primarily neutropenia) that were deemed to be possibly related to a study drug. CONCLUSIONS: Extended prophylaxis with nevirapine or with nevirapine and zidovudine for the first 14 weeks of life significantly reduced postnatal HIV-1 infection in 9-month-old infant s. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00115648.) 2008 Massachusetts Medical Society Comment This important information, coupled with the results of the study abo ve, suggests there are effective strategies to make prolonged breast feed ing safer in HIV affected infants in settings where abrupt cessation of breast feeding may be dangerous. 90% of infant s in this trial were breast fed to 6 months, one-quarter to one-third up to 9 months, and almost 20% to 15 months.

METHODS: In a study that randomized pregnant mothers to HIVNET 01 2 nevirapine versus short-course antenatal zidovudine, we compared breast milk HIV-1 RNA viral shedding and administration of single-dose nevirapine betw een mothers who transmitted HIV-1 to their infants at 6 weeks postpartum and those who did not. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, maximum breast milk HIV-1 RNA levels (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25 to 4.99; P = 0.01) and nevirapine use (HR = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.97; P = 0.05) were each independently associated with perina tal transmission at 6 weeks postpartum. Mothers who transmitted HIV-1 to their infants had signifi cantly higher HIV-1 RNA levels in their breast milk between the second day and sixth week postpartum. Among mothers with maximum breast milk virus levels less than a median of 3.5 log(10) copies/mL, the administration of nevirapine further decreased HIV-1 transmission risk from 22.2% to 0.0% (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Peripartum administration of single-dose nevi rapine to mother and infant decreases early perinatal HIV-1 transmission by means of breast milk HIV-1 RNA suppression and, independently, by providing the infant with exposure prophylaxis J Infect Dis. 2007 Dec 1;196(11):1629-36.

Maternal HIV-1 DNA load and mother-to-child HIV Prevention Trial (PHPT-1), Thailand . Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. narvold@partners.org While many factors contribute to mother-to-ch ild transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1, maternal plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load (RNA-VL) has been consistently found as the main risk factor, including when antiretroviral prophylaxis was used to prevent MTCT. However the predictive value of RNA-VL is poor. A recent study of HIV-1-positive pregnant women who did not receive antiretroviral prophyl axis reported an associati on between HIV-1 DNA viral load (DNA-VL) and MTCT that was stronger than the association between RNA-VL and MTCT. We sought to determine if HIV-1 DNA-VL was indepe ndently associated with MTCT of HIV in a population of women who receiv ed zidovudine prophylaxis during pregnancy and whose infants received zidovudine after birth. Patients we re 33 non-breastfeeding transmitting (TR) and 33 nontransmitting mothers (NTR) from Perinatal HIV Prevention Trial (P HPT-1), a multicenter trial conducted in Thailand compari prophylaxis durations to prevent MTCT. TR and NTR mothers were matched according to baseline RNA-VL. Maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-associ ated HIV-1 DNA was extracted from whole blood, and DNA-VL was establishe d by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. We found that TR had a significantl y higher cell-associated HIV-1 DNA viral load than did NTR. Median TR DNA-VL was 2.54 log( 10) copies per microgram PB MC DNA, while it was 2.28 log(10) copies per microgram PBMC DNA in NTR (Wilcoxon p = 0.02). In summary, HIV-1 DNA viral load was associated with MTCT in a population of women who received antiretroviral prophylaxis during pregnanc y, independently from RNA viral load.

METHODS: At 2, 6, and 12 weeks after birth, complete li pid profiles as well as plasma apolipoproteins levels were assessed in 80 HIV-uninfected newborns, half of whom received NVP and half lamivudine (3TC), respectively. Newborns were randomly selected from a randomized trial in which NVP or 3TC had been administered to HIV-uninfected infants born to HIV-infected mothers to try and prevent HIV-1 transmission from occurring during breast- feeding. RESULTS: After 6 weeks of therapy, the expected physiologi cal decline in HDL-c levels in the newborns was attenuated in infant s treated with NVP, comp ared with levels in those treated with 3TC. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) levels were higher at al l time points in the NVP arm than they were in the 3TC arm (P= .02), reaching peak levels at 6 weeks. The difference in HDL-c was no longer significant at 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: apoA-I levels and HDL-c were elevated in HIV- 1-uninfected newborns receivin g NVP, compared with those receiving 3TC. These data support that NVP may indeed have intr insic apoA-I and HDL-c Inj Prev. 2008 Jun;14(3):164-9. Paraprofessional home visitation program to prevent childhood unintentional injuries in low-income communities: a cluster randomized Health Scien ces, Lenasia, South Africa. swartl@unisa.ac.za OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of a paraprofessional home visitation program (HVP) to improve home safety and prevent in juries among children liv ing in low-income settings. METHODS: The HVP was implemente d in two low-income communities in South Africa. In each community, approximately 200 households were ra ndomly selected for the trial. Eligible households were those with children aged < or = 10 years. Intervention households received four visits, one every two weeks, by trained paraprofessionals that focused on a specific injury topic and consisted of: info rmation dissemination about specific injury prevention practices; home inspection acco mpanied by information about home hazards; and the supply of safety devices. The key outcomes to measure the presence of home hazards were scores for burns (safety practices, paraffin, and electrical ), poisoning, and falls. RESULTS: Significant reductions were found for injury risks related to burn safety practices. For injury risks related to electrical burns, para ffin burns, and poisoning, a decline was also noted although this was not statistically significant. No decline was noted fo r fall-related risks. CONCLUSIONS: Subject to furthe r replication and evaluation, home visits by paraprofessionals providing safety education, home inspection, and safety devices be considered for integration into a comprehensive child injury prevention strategy in low- income communities. 37Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Leishmaniasis Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2008 Feb;78(2):210-1. miltefosine for Oral miltefosine (2.5 mg/kg/d for 28 days) wa s compared with intramuscular antimony (20 mg/kg/d for 20 days) in the treatment taneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania braziliensis in Palos Blancos, The cu re rates with 6 months of follow-up were statistically similar: 36 of 41 evaluable milte (88%) antimony patients.

Institute of Endemic Diseases, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan. Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a recognized dermatosis that follows successful treatment of visceral leishmaniasis in the S udan. This randomized and double-blind study aimed to assess safety, immunogenicity and cura tive potentials of a novel immunochemotherapy regimen in patients with persistent PKDL. Following informed consent, 30 patients were randomized to and SSG. The SSG+Alum/ALM+BCG proved safe w ith minimal local adverse events. In the SSG+vaccine group, 87% of the patients were cured by day 60 compared with 53% in the SSG alone group (SSG+vaccine efficacy=71%, 95% CI for risk ratio 0.7-1.16). On day 90 of follow- up there were two relapses in the SSG alone arm and none in the SSG+vaccine arm. Pre-treatment cytokines showed high IFN-gamma or high IFN-gamma/IL-10 and leishmanin skin test (LST) non-reactivity, while healing/clin ical improvement were associated with LST reactivity and low IFN-gamma levels in both study groups (P=0.004). In conclusion, SSG+Alum/ALM+BCG is safe and immunogenic w ith significant heal ing potentials in 38Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 persistent PKDL lesions. Immunochemother apy probably augmented IFN-gamma production, which induced healing. Leishmanin skin reacti vity is a good surrogate marker of cure in persistent PKDL lesions.

Bacteriology Research Division, Department of Medical Research (Lower Myanmar), Yangon. knopk@yangon.net.mm Chemoprophylaxis was carried out on high risk group of extended contacts of new leprosy cases in Nyaungdon Township, Ayeyarwaddy Divisio n, Myanmar and serological response was followed up for two years. In September 2003, blood samples were collected from 829 contacts after getting informed consent and sera were tested for immunoglobu lin M antibodies using NTP-BSA ELISA test. These 300 seropositives we re randomized to treated and non-treated groups. In each group 102 each were enrolled in adults and 48 each in children. A single dose of ROM (rifampicin, ofloxacin and minocycline) and RMP (rifampicin) by body weight was administered to treated group of above 15 year s and those below 15 years respectively. The vitamins were administered to non-treated gr oup. The blood samples of all contacts were collected again in September 2004 and September 2005 and ELISA was carried out on paired samples on one plate. The mean optical densit y (OD) titers before vs after chemoprophylaxis were 0.24 vs 0.10 and 0.20 vs 0.09 in treated and non-treated group respectiv ely in adults and 0.25 vs 0.11 and 0.22 vs 0.11 respectively in child ren after one year. These were 0.24 vs 0.17 and 0.20 vs 0.19 respectively in adults and 0.25 vs 0.19 and 0.22 vs 0.20 respectively in children after two years. The difference of mean anti body titers before and after chemoprophylaxis in treated group was significantly reduced compared to non-treate d group in adults but was not significant in children. The findings show that there is a signif icant role of chemoprophylaxis on serological response in the form of decreasi ng antibody titer among the adult group of extended contacts.

Dicko A LH , Doumbo OK . Malaria Research and Training Center, Department of Epidemiology of Parasitic Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Pharmacy and Dentistry, University of Bamako, Bamako, Mali. BACKGROUND: Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1) is one of the leading blood stage malaria vaccine candidates. AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel consists of an equal mi xture of recombinant AMA1 from FVO and 3D7 clones of P. falciparum, adsorbed onto Alhydrogel. A Phase 1 study in semi-immune adults in Mali showed that the vaccine was safe and immunogenic, with higher antibody responses in those who received the 80 microg dose. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in young children in a malaria endemic area. DESIGN: This was a Phase 1 dose escalating study in 36 healthy ch ildren aged 2-3 years started in March 2006 in Don\u00e9gu\u00e9bougou, Mali. Eight een children in the first cohort were randomized 2 ratio 1 to receive either 20 microg AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel or Haemophilus influenzae type b Hiberix vaccine. Two weeks later 18 children in the second cohort were randomized 2 ratio 1 to receive either 80 microg AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel or Haemophilus influenzae type b Hiberix vaccine. Vaccinations were administered on Days 0 and 28 and participants were examined on Days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 after vaccination and then about every two months. Results to Day 154 are reported in this manuscript. RESULTS: Of 36 volunteers enrolled, 33 received both vaccinations. There were 9 adverse events rela ted to the vaccination in subjects who received AMA1-C1 vaccine and 7 in those who received Hiberix. All were mild to moderate. No vaccine-related serious or grad e 3 adverse events were observed. There was no increase in adverse events with increasing dos e of vaccine or number of immunizations. In subjects who received the test vaccine, antibod ies to AMA1 increased on Day 14 and peaked at Day 42, with changes from baseline significantly di fferent from subjects who received control vaccine. CONCLUSION: AMA-C1 vaccine is well tolerated and immunogenic in children in this endemic area although the antibody res ponse was short lived. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00341250.

J countries 2007-08 RTS,S/AS02A is a pre-erythrocytic vaccine can didate based on the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite surface antigen and is currentl y the most advanced malaria vaccine candidate in development. A proof of concept phase IIb trial of the RTS,S/AS02A in Mozambican children aged 1-4 years determined a vaccine effi cacy against risk of c linical malaria of 35.3% (95% CI 21.6-46.6; p<0.0001) 48.6% (95% CI 12.3-71.0; p=0.02). We evaluated the safety of the RTS,S/AS02A vaccine. 2022 children that receiv ed at least one vaccine dose of RTS,S/AS02A or control vaccines were included in the intention to treat safety analysis. Vaccine safety was eval uated using active and passive follow-up. Participants were observed for at least 1h after each dose. Traine d field workers visited children at home daily for the next 3 days to record soli cited and unsolicited local and general symptoms. Investigators followed-up participants with se vere adverse events until month 21. Overall, we recorded 1712 unsolicited adverse events after vaccination, 53% in the intervention and 47% in the control group. Most unsolicited adverse events reported w ith RTS,S/AS02A were self- limited, and participants recovere d without sequelae. Local react ogenicity increased with the number of doses. The proportion of children expe riencing serious adverse events was lower in the RTS,S/AS02A recipients compared to the control group (Engerix-Btrade mark or Prevnartrade mark and Hiberixtrade mark). Overall, these results indicate that the RTS,S/AS02A vaccine has a good safety profile and well tolerated when given in three doses to semi-immune children living in malaria-endemic areas.

Barcelona for International Health Research (CRESIB), Hospital Cl\u00ednic/Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a leading global health proble m that requires the improved use of existing interventions and the accelerat ed development of new control methods. We aimed to assess the safety, immunogenicity, a nd initial efficacy of the malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS02D in infants in Africa. METHODS: We did a phase I/IIb double-blind randomised trial of 214 infants in Mozambique. Infants were randomly assigned to receive three doses either of RTS,S/AS02D or the hepatitis B vaccine E ngerix-B at ages 10 weeks, 14 weeks, and 18 weeks of age, as well as rou tine immunisation vaccines given at 8, 12, and 16 weeks of age. The primary endpoint was safety of the RTS,S/AS02D during the first 6 months of the study, and analysis was by intention to treat. Secondary e ndpoints included immunogenicity and analysis of new Plasmodium falciparum infections duri ng a 3-month follow up after the third dose. Time to new infections in the pe r-protocol cohort were compared between groups using Cox 41Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 regression models. This study is registered with Clin icalTrials.gov, number NCT00197028. FINDINGS: There were 17 children (15.9%; 95% CI 9.5-24.2) with serious adverse events in each group. In the follow-up which ended on March 6, 2007, there were 31 serious adverse events in the RTS,S/AS02D group and 30 serious adverse events in the Engerix-B group, none of which were reported as related to vaccina tion. There were four deaths during this same follow-up period; all of them afte r the active detection of infec tion period had finished at study month 6 (two in RTSS/AS02D group and two in the Engerix-B group). RTS,S/AS02D induced high titres of anti-circumsporozoite antibodies. 68 first or only P falciparum infections were documented: 22 in the RTS,S/AS02D group and 46 in the control group. The adjusted vaccine efficacy was 65.9% (95% CI 42.6-79.8%, p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: The RTS,S/AS02D malaria vaccine was safe, well tol erated, and immunogenic in young infants. These findings set the stage for expanded phase III efficacy studies to confirm vaccine efficacy against clinical malaria disease.

Molecular markers of resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine during intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in Mozambican infants. Mayor A , treatment in infant s (IPTi) with sulfadoxine- pyrimethamine (SP) is a potential malaria cont rol strategy. There is c oncern about the impact that increasing in vivo resistance to SP has on the efficacy of IPTi, as well as about the potential contribution of IPTi to increases in resistance. METHODS: We compared the frequency of clinical episodes of malaria caused by P. fa lciparum parasites with mutations in dhfr and dhps among sick children who received SP or placebo in the context of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled IPTi trial in Mozambique. RESULTS: Half of the children who received placebo harbored quintuple-pure muta nt parasites. Nevertheless, the protective efficacy of IPTi within the 35 days after th e third dose was 70.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40.7%-85.6%). Between month 2 after the th ird IPTi dose and the end of the follow-up period, children receiving SP harbored more dhp s codon 437 mixed infections (odds ratio [OR], 10.56 [95% CI, 1.30-86.14]) and fewer dhps double-pur e mutant parasites (OR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.22-0.84]) than did placebo recipients. CONCLUSIONS: IPTi appears to be associated with some changes in the prevalence of genotypes involved in SP resistance. In the face of a high prevalence of quintuple-mutant parasites, SP exhibited a high level of efficacy in the prevention of new episodes of malaria in infants. 42Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Malar J. 2008 Mar 25;7:50. Process and effects of a community intervention on malaria in rural Burkina Faso: randomized controlled trial. Kouyat\u00e9 B N ouna, Burkina Faso, Africa. bkouyate@hotmail.com BACKGROUND: In the rural area s of sub-Saharan Africa, th e majority of young children affected by malaria have no access to formal health services. Home treatment through mothers of febrile children supported by moth er groups and local health workers has the potential to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A cluster-randomized controlled effectiveness trial was implemented from 2002-2004 in a malaria endemic area of rural Burkina Faso. Six and seven villages were randomly a ssigned to the intervention and control arms respectively. Febrile children from interventi on villages were treated with chloroquine (CQ) by their mothers, supported by local women group leaders. CQ was regularly supplied through a revolving fund fr om local health centres. The trial was evaluated through two cross-sectional surveys at baseline and after tw o years of intervention. The primary endpoint of the study was the proportion of modera te to severe anaemia in children aged 6-59 months . For assessment of the development of drug efficacy over time, an in vivo CQ efficacy study was nested into the trial. The study is re gistered under http:// www.controlled-trials.com (ISRCTN 34104704). RESULTS: The intervention was shown to be feasible under program conditions and a total of 1.076 children and 999 child ren were evaluated at baseline and follow- up time points respectively. Self-reported CQ treat ment of fever episodes at home as well as referrals to health centres increased over the study period. At follow-up, CQ was detected in the blood of high proportions of inte rvention and control children. Compared to baseline findings, the prevalence of anaemia (29% vs 16%, p < 0.0001) and malaria parameters such as prevalence of P. falciparum parasitaemia, feve r and palpable spleens was lower at follow- up but there were no differences between the int ervention and control group. CQ efficacy decreased over the study period but this wa s not associated with the intervention. DISCUSSION: The decreasing prevalence of ma laria morbidity including anaemia over the study period can be explained by an overall in crease of malaria pr evention and treatment activities in the study area. The lack of effectiveness of the intervention was likely caused by contamination, pre-existing differences in the coverage of malaria treatment in both study groups and an unexpectedly rapid increase of resi stance against CQ, the fi rst-line treatment drug at the time of the study. Comment This effectiveness stud y shows that the importance of context in understanding the lessons from RCTs. In settings where malaria control progr ams are working, the impact of IPTi or home based treatment will be less, and local drug re sistance may markedly reduce effectiveness.

Infectious Disease Epidemiology Group, Bernha rd Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Bernhard-Nocht-Strasse 74, D-20359 Ha mburg, Germany. kobbe@bni-hamburg.de BACKGROUND: Intermittent preventive antimalarial treatment in infants (IPTi) is currently evaluated as a malaria control strategy. Among the factors influencing the extent of protection that is provided by IPTi are the transmission in tensity, seasonality, drug resistance patterns, and the schedule of IPTi administ rations. The aim of this study was to determine how far the protective efficacy of IPTi depends on spatio-temporal variations of the prevailing incidence of malaria. METHODS: One thousand seventy infants were en rolled in a registered controlled trial on the efficacy of IPTi with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in the Ashanti Region, Ghana, West Africa (ClinicalTrial.gov: NC T00206739). Stratification for the village of residence and the month of birth of study participants demonstrat ed that the malaria incidence was dependent on spatial (range of incidence rates in different villages 0.6-2.0 episodes/year) and temporal (range of incidence rates in children of different birth months 0.8-1.2 episodes/year) factors. The range of spatio-temporal va riation allowed ecological analyses of the correlation between malaria incidence rates, an ti-Plasmodium falciparum lysate IgG antibody levels and protective efficacies provided by IPTi. RESULTS: Protective efficacy of the first SP administration was positively correlated with malaria incidences in children living in a distinct village or born in a distin ct month (R2 0.48, p < 0.04 and R2 0.63, p < 0.003, respectively). Corresponding trends were seen af ter the second and third study drug administration. Accordingly, IgG levels against para site lysate increased with malaria incidence. This correlation was stronger in children who received IPTi, indicating an e ffect modification of the intervention. CONCLUSION: The spatial and temporal variations of malaria incidences in a geographically and meteorologically homogeneous study area exemplify the need for close monitoring of local incidence ra tes in all types of intervention studies. The increase of the protective efficacy of IPTi with malaria incidences may be relevant for IPTi implementation strategies and, possibly, for other malaria control measures.

METHODS: In Gabon, 1189 infants received either sulfadoxine-pyrimet hamine (SP; 250 and 12.5 mg, respectively) or placebo at 3, 9, and 15 months of age. Children were actively followed-up until 18 months of age. RESULTS: In the intent ion-to-treat population at 18 mo nths of follow-up, 84 children (17%) in the SP group had > or =1 episode of anemia, versus 108 (21%) in the placebo group (protective efficacy, 22% [95% confidence in terval {CI}, -1% to 40%]; P=.06). In the intervention group, there were 66 episodes during 485 person-years at risk, compared with 79 episodes during 497 years in the placebo group (p rotective efficacy, 17% [95% CI, -24% to 45%; P=.36). The effects were similar at 12 mont hs of follow-up. The study drug was safe and well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was efficacious, producing a reduction in risk for anemia but a smaller effect against malaria. It is a valuable additional tool to control malaria in a highly vulnerable age group. Remaining important questions are curr ently being addressed in further studies.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00167843. Trop Med Int Health.

OBJECTIVE: To assess how intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) affects Immu noglobulin (IgG) immune responses against Plasmodium falciparum in infants from rural Ghana. METHODS: Randomized, placebo- controlled and double-blinded clinic al trial with participants ra ndomized in blocks of 10 to receive either 250 mg sulphadoxine/2.5 mg pyrimetha mine or placebo at the age of 3 (IPTi-1), 9 (IPTi-2) and 15 (IPTi-3) months and followed-up for 21 months.

(ii) L ongitudinal study of the relationship between IgG levels and P. falciparum infections and/or clini cal malaria in 17 naive children until they reached the age of 2 years. RESULTS: IgG antibody levels against crude P. falciparum lysate were dependent on the fre quency of preceding infections and significantly lower in children treated with SP. CO NCLUSION: Placebo-treated children had an indifferentially higher incidence of P. falcipar um infections than c linically observed, which implicates an underestimation of the protectiv e efficacy of IPTi. IgG profiles in 17 children followed up until the age of 2 years provided no ev idence for impaired immune responses after a single dose of SP within the framework of IPTi. 45Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2007 Sep;77(3):411-7.

Barcelona Centre for International Health Res earch, Hospital Clinic/IDIBAPS, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. jjairo@clinic.ub.es BACKGROUND: Naturally acquired malaria immunity has many determinants and, in the absence of immunological markers of protection, studies assessing malaria incidence through clinical endpoints remain an approach to defi ning immunity acquisiti on. We investigated the role of age in disease incidence and the eff ects of chemoprophylaxis on clinical immunity development to Plasmodium falciparum duri ng a randomised controlled trial. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A total of 415 Tanzanian infants were randomly assigned to receive weekly malaria prophylaxis with Deltaprim (3.125 mg of pyrimethamine plus 25 mg of dapsone) 46Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 or placebo between the ages of 2 and 12 mo. Children were followed up until 4 y of age. Uncomplicated febrile malaria, severe malari a, and anaemia morbidity were assessed through hospital-based passive surveillance. Compared with the group of control participants, there was a marked reduction in the incidence of clinical malaria, severe malaria, and anaemia in the group of children who had received chem oprophylaxis during the first year of life. After discontinuing the intervention, there was a significant increase in the incidence of clinical malaria for 2 y. The cumulative rates of clinical malaria, by age 4 y, were slightly higher in the group of children who had previ ously received chemoprophylaxis: 3.22 episodes versus 3.02 episodes in the group of control part icipants; rate difference 0.20 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.21 to 0.59). By age 4 y, the cumu lative rates of severe malaria, however, were slightly lower in chemosuppressed children (0.47 versus 0.59) (rate difference -0.12 [95% CI: 0.27 to 0.03]). The number of episodes of anaemia was also slightly lower in chemosuppressed children by age 4 y: 0.93 episode s (95% CI: 0.79 to 0.97) versus 1.12 episodes in the group of control participants (95% CI: 0.97 to 1.28) (ra P. falciparum antigens through chemoprophylaxis early in life can delay immuni ty acquisition. Infants appear to acquire immunity faster than older children, but have a higher risk of developing severe forms of malaria and anaemia.

Intermittent preventive treatment in infancy (IPTi) involves the administration of antimalarials alongside routine vaccinations and might be an option in malaria control. In an area of intense, perennial malaria transmission in northern Ghana, 1,200 children received IPTi with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine or placebo at approximately 3, 9, and 15 months of age. Children were followed up until 24 months of ag e to assess morbidity and adverse events. During the intervention period (3 to 18 months of age), IPTi reduced the incidences of malaria and severe anemia by 22.5% (95% confidence in terval, 12 to 32%) and 23.6% (95% confidence interval, 4 to 39%), respectivel and reduced hospita lizations and episodes of asymptomatic parasitemia by one-third. Protection was pronounced in the first year of life and not discernible in the second. The malaria-protective effect was largely confined to a period of 1 month after sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatments. Follo wing the interventi on, protection against asymptomatic parasitemia persisted. In contra st, a significant rebound of severe malaria, predominantly severe malarial anemia, occu rred among children having received IPTi. Although 47Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 the treatment was generally well tolerated, one case of moderately severe skin reaction followed sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine treatment. IPTi reduces malaria and anemia in infants in northern Ghana. Extension of IPTi into the second year of life by administering a dose at 15 months of age provided no substantial bene fit beyond a 1-month prophylactic effect. Although this simple intervention offers one of the few available malaria-preventive measures for regions where malaria is endemic, the observed rebound of severe malaria advise s caution and requires further investigation. Comment These IPTi studies show that infants receiving IPTi subsequently have an increased risk of severe malaria in the second year of life. However the net benefit of IPTi is still positive in areas of high malaria endemnicity, as infants have a higher risk of severe forms of malaria and anaemia. In the study above by study by Aponte in Tanzania, while there may be a rebound in morbidity following the intervention, the cumula tive rates of severe malaria and severe anaemia in the intervention group remained just below those of the control group until 4 years of age.

If prescribers complied with current guidelines, microscopy would give rise to lower average cost s per patient correctly treated than RDTs in areas of both high and low transmission. RDT introduction would result in an additional 2.3% and 9.4% of patients correctly treated, at an incremental cost of $25 and $7 in the low and high transmission settings, respectively. Cost-effectiveness would be worse if prescribers do not comply with test results. The cost of this addition al benefit may be higher than many countries can afford without external assistance or lower RDT prices.

Kirby MJ , Milligan PJ , Conway DJ , Lindsay University, s.w.lindsay@durham.ac.uk. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Mosquito-proofing ho mes was one of the principal methods of environmental management in the early 1900s. House screening provides protection against malaria by reducing exposure to malaria paras ites and has the added benefit of protecting everyone sleeping in the house, a voiding issues of inequity within the household. The aim of this study is to determine whether house screening protects people against malaria in Africa. It is hoped that this study will mark the beginning of a series of trials assessing a range of environmental interventions for malaria control in Africa. DESIGN: A 3-armed randomised- controlled trial will be conducted in and ar ound Farafenni town in The Gambia, West Africa, to assess whether screening windows, doors and closing eaves or installing netting ceilings in local houses can substantiall y reduce malaria transmission and anaemia compared to homes with no screening. Eligible houses will be sorted and stratified by location and the number of children in each house, then ra ndomly allocated to the interventions in blocks of 5 houses (2 with full screening, 2 with screened ceilings and 1 control house without screening). Risk of malaria transmission will be assessed in each house by routine collections of mosquitoes using light traps and an anaemia preval ence study in children at the end of the main transmission period. DISCUSSION : Practical issues concerning intervention implementation, as well as the potential benefits and risks of the study, are discussed.

Effect of expanded insecticide-treated bednet coverage on child survival in rural Kenya: . Malaria Public Health and Epidemiology Group, Centre for Geographic Medicine Research-Coast, Kenya Medical Research Institute/ Wellcome Trust Research Programme, Nairobi, Kenya. gfegan@kilifi.kemri-wellcome.org BACKGROUND: The potential of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) to contribute to child survival has been well documented in randomised controlled trials. ITN coverage has increased rapidly in Kenya from 7% in 2004 to 67% in 2006. We aimed to assess the extent to which this 49Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 investment has led to improvement s in child survival. METHODS: A dynamic cohort of about 3500 children aged 1-59 months were enumerated three times at yearly intervals in 72 rural clusters located in four districts of Kenya. The effect of ITN use on mortality was assessed with Poisson regression to take acc ount of potential effect -modifying and confounding covariates. FINDINGS: 100 children died over 2 year s. Overall mortality rates were much the same in the first and second years of the study (14.5 per 1000 person-years in the first year and 15.4 per 1000 person-years in the second). After adjustment for age, time period, and a number of other possible confounding variabl es, ITN use was associated with a 44% reduction in mortality (mortality rate rati o 0.56, 95% CI 0.33-0.96; p=0.04). This level of protection corresponds to about seven deaths averted for every 1000 ITNs distributed. INTERPRETATION: A combined approach of social marketing followed by mass free distribution of ITNs translated in to child survival effects that ar e comparable with those seen in previous randomised controlled trials Comment This important effectiveness trial confirms the substantial and sust ained benefit on child survival of insecticide treated ned-nets. The e ffect size was very large in this study, with 7 deaths averted for every 100 ITNs distributed. Treatment of uncomplicated malaria Comment This year there are 21 studies of treatment for un complicated malaria treatment. Many of the results are locally relevant, but their generalizability depends on local rates of drug resistance. General findings include the results of studies that artesunate and amodiaquine and was associated with neutropenia in HIV-infected children in Uganda and amodiaquine and SP was associated with neutropenia in Malawi, where HIV-infection rates are high. Newer therapies this year include methylene blue (an old therap y re-visted in one study) and dihydroartemisinin- piperaquine (relatively ne w: 4 studies), both drugs showing promising results.

Maiteki-Sebuguzi C , Combination antimalarial is recommended for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Africa; however, some concerns about the safety and tolerability of new regimens remain. This study compared the safety and tolerability of three combination antimalarial regimens in a cohort of Ugandan children. METHODS: A longitudinal, single-blind, randomized clini cal trial of children was conducted between November 2004 and May 2007 in Kampala, Uganda . Upon diagnosis of the first episode of uncomplicated malaria, participants were randomized to treatment with amodiaquine health in developing countries 2007-08 lumefantrine (AL). Once randomized, participants received the same regimen for all subsequent episodes of uncomplicated malaria. Participants were actively monitored for adverse events for the first 14 days after each treatment, and then passively followed until their next study medication treatment, or withdraw al from study. Outcome measures included the risk of adverse events at 14 and 42 days after treatment. RE SULTS: Of 601 enrolled children, 382 were diagnosed with at least one episode of uncom plicated malaria and were treated with study medications. The median age at tr eatment was 6.3 years (range 1.1 - 12.3 years). At 14 days of follow-up, AQ+SP treatment was associated with a higher risk of anorexia, weakness, and subjective fever than treatment with AL, and a higher risk of weakness, and subjective fever than treatment with AS+AQ. Treatment with AL was associated with a higher risk of elevated temperature. Repeated episodes of neutropaenia associated with AS+AQ were detected in one participant. Considering only children less than five years, those who received AQ+SP were at higher risk of developing modera te or severe anorexia and wea kness than those treated with AL (anorexia: RR 3.82, 95% CI 1.59 - 9.17; wea kness: RR 5.40, 95% 1.86 - 15.7), (anorexia: RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.04 - 4.23; weakness: RR 2.26, 95% CI 1.01 - 5.05). Extending the analysis to 42 days of follow-up had little impact on the findings. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the safety and tolerability of AS+AQ and AL in Ugandan children, and suggests that AQ+SP is safe, but less well-tolerated, particul arly in younger children. As newer antimalarial regimens are deployed, collecting da ta on their safety and tolerability will be essential. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials Identifier ISRCTN37517549.

Department of Internal Medici ne, Makerere University, Mula go Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. agasasira@berkeley.edu BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapies are rapidly being adopted for the treatment of malaria in Africa; however, there are limited data on their safety and efficacy among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-inf ected populations. METHODS: We compared malaria treatment outcomes between cohorts of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children in Uganda who were observed for 18 and 29 mont hs, respectively. Malaria was treated with artesunate plus amodiaquine, and outcomes were assessed using standardized guidelines. HIV- infected children received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole pr ophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy in accordance with current guidelines. RESULT S: Twenty-six HIV-infected participants experiencing 35 episodes of malaria and 134 HIV-uninfected child ren experiencing 258 episodes of malaria were included in the study. Twelve HIV-infected children were receiving antiretroviral therapy, 11 of whom were r eceiving zidovudine. Malaria treatment was highly efficacious in both the HIV-infected and HIV-uninf ected cohorts (28-day risk of recrudescence, 0% and 3.6%, respectively); however, there was a trend towards increased risk of recurrent malaria among the HIV-uninfected children (2.9 % vs. 13.2%; p = .08). Importantly, the risk of 51Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 neutropenia 14 days after initia tion of treatment with artesunate plus amodiaquine was higher among HIV-infected children than among HIV-uni nfected children (45% vs. 6%; p < .001). The severity of all episodes of ne utropenia in HIV-uninfected children was mild to moderate, and 16% of episodes of neutropenia in the HIV-infected cohort were severe or life-threatening (neutrophil count, <750 cells/mm(3)). In the HIV-infected cohort, the risk of neutropenia was significantly higher among children who received antiretroviral therapy than among those who did not receive antiretroviral therapy (75% vs. 26%; p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Artesunate plus amodiaquine was highly efficacious for malari a treatment in HIV-infected children but was associated with a high risk of neutropenia, especi ally in the context of concurrent antiretroviral use. Our findings highlight an urgent need for ev aluation of alternative antimalarial therapies for HIV-infected individuals. Med Princ Pract. 2008;17(3):197-201. Epub 2008 Apr 10.

Falade CO , Michael SO , Oduola AM . Department Pharmacology, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria. fallady@skannet.com OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the comparative e fficacy of amodiaquine (AMQ) alone and the combination of AMQ and chlorpheniramine (CP) in the treatment of acute uncomplicated malaria in children. SUBJECTS: Of the 110 ch ildren enrolled in the study, 103 with acute uncomplicated malaria, aged 6 months to 12 years, were evaluated using the 14-day modification of the WHO field test. The pa tients were randomized to 2 groups. Group 1 received supervised treatment with AMQ alone (10 mg AMQ base /kg daily for 3 days), while group 2 received supervised treatment with AMQ (same dose as group 1) plus CP (AMQCP) for 7 days. RESULTS: Both treatment regimens were well tolerated and no patient was withdrawn as a result of recurrent vomiting or drug-related adverse events. There was no significant difference in mean fever and para site clearance times. The cure rates at day 7 were 90.2 versus 100% (rho = 0.027) for AMQ versus AMQCP, while the day 14 cure rates were 85.9 versus 98.1% for AMQ versus AMQCP, respectively (rho = CONCLUSION: The combination of AMQ plus CP proved significan tly more effective than AMQ alone in the treatment of acute uncomplicated falciparum malari a, most probably due to the e nhancement of the antimalarial effect of AMQ by CP. The combination of AMQCP could be a better alternative to AMQ alone as a companion drug in artemisinin-based combin ation therapies. (c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel PLoS ONE. 2008 Mar 5;3(3):e1779. Open-label comparative clinical study of chlorproguanil-dapsone fixed dose combination (Lapdap) alone or with three different doses of artesunate for 52Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 uncomplicated falciparum Pharmacology & Therapeutics, Un iversity of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom. The objective of this study was to determine the a ppropriate dose of artesunate for use in a fixed dose combination therapy with chlorproguani l-dapsone (CPG-DDS) for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. METHODS: Open-label clinical trial comparing CPG-DDS alone or with artesunate 4, 2, or 1 mg/kg at me dical centers in Blantyre , Malawi and Farafenni, The Gambia. The trial was conducted between June 2002 and February 2005, including 116 adults (median age 27 years) and 107 child ren (median age 38 months) with acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Subjects were randomized into 4 groups to receive CPG-DDS alone or plus 4, 2 or 1 mg /kg of artesunate once daily for 3 days. Assessments took place on Days 0-3 in hospital and follow-up on Days 7 and 14 as out-patients. Efficacy was evaluated in the Day 3 per-protocol (PP) population using mean time to reduce baseline parasitemia by 90% (PC90). A number of secondary outcomes were also included. Appropriate artesunate dose was determined using a pre-defined decision matrix based on primary and secondary outcomes. Treatment em ergent adverse events were recorded from clinical assessments and blood parameters. Safety was evaluated in the intent to treat (ITT) population. RESULTS: In the Day 3 PP population for the adult group (N = 85), mean time to PC90 was 19.1 h in the CPG-DDS group, significantly longer than for the +artesunate 1 mg/kg (12.5 h; treatment difference -6.6 -3.2]) groups. For children in the Day 3 PP population (N = 92), mean time to PC90 was 21.1 h in the CPG-DDS group, similar to the +artesunate 1 and 4 mg/kg groups had signifi cantly shorter mean times to PC90 (treatment difference -6.4 h (-7.4 h [95%CI -12.9, -1.8]), respectively. An analysis of mean time to PC90 for the Day 14 PP and ITT populations was consistent with the primary analysis. Treatment emergent, drug-related adverse events were experienced in 35.3% (41/116) of adults 70.1% (75/107) of ch ildren; hematological and gastroenterological. The nature and incidence of adve rse events was similar between the groups. No dose-related changes in laboratory para meters were observed. Nine serious adverse events due to any cause occurred in five subject s including two cases of hemolysis believed to be associated with drug treatment (one adult, one child). One adult died of anaphylactic shock, not associated with investigational thera py. CONCLUSIONS: CPG-DD S plus artesunate demonstrated advantages over CPG-DDS alone for the primary efficacy endpoint (mean time to PC90) except in children for the 1 mg/kg arte sunate dose. Based on a pre-defined decision matrix, the primary endpoint in the child gr oup supported an artesunate dose of 4 mg/kg. Secondary endpoints also supported a 4 mg/kg ar tesunate dose to take forward into the remainder of the development program. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00519467.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SU BJECT: * Both chloroquine (CQ) and sulfadoxine/ pyrimethamine (SDx/PYR) remain impor tant drugs in the control of malaria. * The available data on CQ, SDx and PYR are su mmary pharmacokinetic parameters based on classical/traditional methods, mostly in a dults. * No study has described the population pharmacokinetics of a fixed-dose CQ + SDx/PYR combination in children with falciparum malaria. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: * This study presents population pharmacokinetic data on CQ and SDx in children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria. * The study demonstrates that in age-based fixed-dose regimens with CQ and SDx, drug exposures and outcomes may be correctly predicted, although correlation with body weight is poor. * The study proposes dose modification to improve response with the CQ + SDx/PYR combination. AIMS: To sulfa doxine (SDx), and to identify predictors of treatment response in children with malaria given the CQ + SDx and pyrimethamine n with uncomplicated falciparum malaria, 6 months to 5 years old, were randomly treated with prepacked fixed-dose CQ + SDx/PYR. The youngest children (<24 ived half strength and the olde r (>24 months) full strength treatment. The reported day 14 failure rates we re 48% and 18%, respec tively. Capillary blood (100 microl) applied on to filter paper was collect ed on eight occasions during 28 days of follow up. Concentrations of CQ and SDx were determ ined. A population approach was used for the pharmacokinetic analysis. RESULT S: A two-compartment model adequately described the data for both CQ and SDx. For CQ, the typical apparent clearance (CL/ F) and volume of distribution (V(C)/F) values were estimated to be 2.84 l h(-1) and 230 l. The typical CL/F for SDx was 0.023 l h(-1), while the factor relating its V(C) /F to normalized body weight was 1.6 l kg(-1). Post hoc parameter estimates for both drugs showed lower maximum concentrations (C(max)) and concentration-time curve areas (AUC(0,336 h)) in younger children. The AUC(0,336 h) for SDx and CQ were independently significant fact ors for prediction of cure. Simulations suggest that giving the higher dose to the youngest children would result in higher CQ and SDx concentrations and improved outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that full- strength combination to all child ren would improve the cure rate. PLoS ONE. 2008 Feb 20;3(2):e1630. Safety and efficacy of methylene blue combined with artesunate or amodiaquine for uncomplicated falciparum malaria: a randomized controlled trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Centre de Recherche en Sant\u00e9 de Nouna, Nouna, Burkina Faso. BACKGROUND: Besides existing ar temisinin-based combination th erapies, alternative safe, effective and affordable drug combinations against falciparum malaria are needed. Methylene blue (MB) was the first synthetic antimalarial drug ever used, and recent studies have been promising with regard to its revival in malaria therapy. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of two MB-based malari a combination therapies, MB-artesunate (AS) and MB-amodiaquine (AQ), compar ed to the local standard of care, AS-AQ, in Burkina Faso. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Open-label randomised controlled phase II study in 180 children aged 6-10 years with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Nouna, north-western Burkina Faso. Follow-up was for 28 days and analysis by intenti on-to-treat. The treatment groups were similar in baseline characteristics a nd there was only one loss to follow-up. No drug-related serious adverse events and no deaths occurred. MB-cont aining regimens were associated with mild vomiting and dysuria. No early treatment failu res were observed. Para site clearance time differed significantly among groups and was the shortest with MB-AS. By day 14, the rates of adequate clinical and parasitological respons e after and 100% for AS-AQ (p = 0.003). By day 28, the respective figure was lowest for MB-AS (62%), intermediate for the standard treatment AS-AQ (82%; 0.015), and highe CONCLUSIONS: MB-AQ is a promising alterna tive drug combination against malaria in Africa. Moreover, MB has the potential to furt her accelerate the rapid parasite clearance of artemisinin-based combination therapies. More th an a century after the antimalarial properties of MB had been described, its role in malari a control deserves closer attention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00354380.

Bell DJ , Department of Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, United Kingdom. BACKGROUND: In Malawi, there has been a return of Plasmodium falciparum sensitivity to chloroquine (CQ) since sulfadoxine -pyrimethamine (SP) replaced CQ as first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria. When used for prophylax is, Amodiaquine (AQ) was associated with agranulocytosis but is considered safe for treatment and is incr easingly being used in Africa. Here we compare the efficacy, safety and selection of resistance using SP or CQ+SP or artesunate (ART)+SP or AQ+SP for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria. METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: 455 children aged 1-5 years were recruited into a double- blinded randomised trial comparing SP to the three combination therapies. Using intention to treat analysis with missing outcomes treated as su ccesses, and without adju stment to distinguish 55Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 recrudescence from new infections, the day 28 ad equate clinical and pa rasitological response (ACPR) rate for SP was 25%, inferior to each of the three combina tion therapies (p<0.001). AQ+SP had an ACPR CQ+SP (81%) and children developed a neutropenia of </=0.5x10(3) cells/microl by day 14, more commonly after AQ+SP (p = 0.03). The mutation pfcr t 76T, associated with CQ resistance, was detected in none of the pre-treatment or post-treatment parasites. The prevalence of the pfmdr1 86Y mutation was higher after treatment with AQ+SP than after SP, p = 0.002. CONCLUSIONS: The combination AQ+SP was highly efficacious, despite the low efficacy of SP alone; however, we found evidence that AQ ma y exert selective pressure for resistance associated mutations many weeks after treatment . This study confirms the return of CQ sensitivity in Malawi and importantly, shows no evidence of the re-emerg ence of pfcrt 76T after treatment with CQ or AQ. Given the safety record of AQ when used as a prophylaxis, our observations of marked falls in neutrophil counts in the AQ+ SP group requires further scrutiny. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Contro for treating uncomplicated childhood malaria in Gabon: a randomi zed trial to guide national policy. Kombila M . National Malaria Control Program me - Division for Disease Control, Ministry of Health, Brazzaville, Congo. basilensimba@aol.com BACKGROUND: In Gabon, following the adoption of amodiaquine/artesunate combination (AQ/AS) as first-line treatment of malaria and of sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) for preventive intermittent treatment of pregnant women, a clinical trial of SP versus AQ was conducted in a sub-urban area. This is the fi rst study carried out in Gabon following the WHO guidelines. METHODS: A random comparison of the efficacy of AQ (10 mg/kg/day x 3 d) and a single dose of SP (25 mg/kg of sulphadoxine/1 .25 mg/kg of pyrimethamine) was performed in children under five years of age, with uncompli cated falciparum malaria, using the 28-day WHO therapeutic efficacy test. In addition, molecu lar genotyping was performed to distinguish recrudescence from reinfection and to determine the frequency of the dhps K540E mutation, as a molecular marker to predict SP-treatment failure. RESULTS: The day-28 PCR-adjusted treatment failures that SP was significan tly superior to AQ (P = 0.019) in the treatment of unc omplicated childhood malaria and for preventing recurrent infections. Both treatments were safe and well-tolerated, with no serious adverse reactions recorded. The dhps K540E mutation was not found among the 76 pa rasite isolates test ed. CONCLUSION: The level of AQ-resistance observed in the presen t study may compromise efficacy and duration of use of the AQ/AS combination, th e new first-line malaria treatm ent. Gabonese policy-makers need to plan country-wide and close surveillance of AQ/AS efficacy to determine whether, and for how long, these new recommendations for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria remain valid. 56Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Malar J. 2007 Dec 21;6:170. Adding artesunate to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine greatly improves the treatment efficacy in children with unc omplicated falciparum malaria on the coast of Benin, West Africa. A , Erhart it s national antimalarial drug policy from monotherapies to combinations containing artemisinin derivatives. When this decision was taken, the available information on alterna tives to chloroquine and sulphadoxine- pyrimethamine, the first- and second-line treatment, was sparse. METHODS: In 2003 - 2005, before the drug policy change, a randomized, open- label, clinical trial was carried out on the efficacy of chloroquine, and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine alone or combined with artesunate, with the aim of providing policy makers with the information needed to formulate a new antimalarial drug policy. Children between six an d 59 months of age, with uncomplicated malaria and living in the lagoon costal area in so uthern Benin, were randomly allocated to one of the three study arms and followed up for 28 days. RESULTS: Treatment failure (PCR corrected) was significantly lower in the artesunate + sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine group (4/77, 5.3%) < 0.001). Despite high sulphadoxi ne-pyrimethamine failure, its combination with artesunate greatly improved treatment e fficacy. CONCLUSION: In Benin, artesunate + sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine is efficacious and could be used when the recommended artemisinin-based combinations (artemether-lumefantrine and amodiaquine-artesunate) are not available. However, because sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine is also used in pregnant women as intermittent preventive treatment, its combina tion with artesunate should not be widely employed in malaria patients as this may comp romise the efficacy of intermittent preventive treatment.

Kabanywanyi AM , t Centre, Tanzania. omulokozi@gmail.com BACKGROUND: Tanzania switched the antimalarial first line to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in 2001 from ineffective chloroquine (CQ) . By 2003 higher levels of SP resistance were recorded, prompting an urgent ne ed for replacing the first line drug with ACT, as currently recommended by the World Health Organization. Despite this recommendation country-specific evidence-based data to support efficacy and safe ty profile of ACT is still limited. A study on the efficacy and safety of artesunate plus amodiaquine (AS+AQ) and artemether plus lumefantrine (AL)(Coartem) was carried out in 2004 with the view of supporting the National Malaria Control Programme in the review of the polic y in mainland Tanzania. METHODS: An in vivo efficacy study was conducted at Ipinda and Mlimba health facili ties between May and November 2004. The study recruite d children aged 6-59 months pr esenting with symptoms of uncomplicated malaria, history of fever or an axillary temperature > or =37.5 to received either SP or amodiaquine monotherapy or treated with standard doses of AS+AQ in Mlimba and Coartem in Kyela and followed-up for 28 days to assess treatment responses. This study reports results of the co mbination therapies. RESULTS: A total of 157 children (76 in Mlimba and 99 in Kyela) who we re enrolled in to the study and treated with either AL or AS+AQ were successfully followed-up. Both combinations were tolerated and effected rapid fever and parasite clearance. The crude ACPRs were 80 (87%) and 41 (63%) for 58Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 AL and AS+AQ respectively. However, after PC R adjustments the corresponding figures raised to 100% (n = 86) and 93.8% (n = 45) in AL and AS+AQ groups, respectively. The mean haemoglobin improved moderately from day 0 to day 28 by 1 g/dl in AL and 0.4 g/dl in AS+AQ treatment group and was statistically signi ficant (p < 0.001 both). CONCLUSION: These findings provide substantial evidence that AL is highly efficacious in areas of high resistance of SP and supported the country's decision to switch from SP monotherapy to AL.

Early treatmen t failures occurred in 5 patients treated with amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine a nd in 2 patients each treated with the other regimens. The day 28 risk of recurrent parasi temia, unadjusted by genotyping, was significantly higher for patients receiving artemether-lumefantr ine than for patients receiving amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (20.1% vs. 6.2%; difference, 17.9%; 95% confidence interval, 11. 6%-24.1%). Similar differences were seen for children <5 years of age (54% of the study population) a nd when outcomes were extended to 42 days. Significant differences were not seen between outcomes for patie nts receiving amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and outcomes for t hose receiving dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. Recrudescences were uncommon (o ccurring in <5% of patients) in all treatment groups. No serious adverse events were not ed. CONCLUSIONS: All regimens were highly efficacious in clearing infection, but considering the risks of recurrent ma laria after therapy, the amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine regimens were more efficacious than the artemether-lumefantrine re gimen (the new national regimen in Burkina Faso) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.

Central University Hospital of Kigali, Kigali, Rwanda. stevenruse@yahoo.com In view of the changing policy towards artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), the efficacy, tolerance, and degree of re-infection of two ACTs were investigated: artesunate plus sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (As + SP) and AS plus sulfamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine (As + SMP). One hundred three children were assigned to receive As + SP and 109 to receive As + SMP. In spite of the high inci dence of resistance to SP, As + SP showed satisfactory results consistent with recent recommendations for ACTs (adequate clinical and parasitologic response on day 28 [ACPR] > or = 90%), but results with As + SMP fulfilled the most stringent criteria (ACPR > or = 95%). The absence of side effects and the low price of these drugs make them it worth to reconsider national therapies in favor of either of these two drug combinations. PLoS ONE. 2007 Oct 31;2(10):e1101. A randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of dihydroartemisinin- piperaquine for the treatment of uncom plicated falciparum malaria is an impor tant health problem in the Peruvian Amazon region. We carried out a rand omised open label clinical trial comparing mefloquine-artesunate, the current first line treatment in this region, with dihydroartemisinin- piperaquine. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Between July 2003 and July 2005, 522 patients with P. falciparum uncomplicated malaria were recruited, randomized (260 with mefloquine- artesunate and 262 with dihydroartemisinin-piper aquine), treated and followed up for 63 days. PCR-adjusted adequate clinical and parasito logical response, estimated by Kaplan Meier survival and Per Protocol analysis, was extremely high for both drugs (99.6% for mefloquine-artesunate and 98.4% and for dihydroartemis p = All recrudescences were late parasitologica l failures. Overall, 60Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 gametocytes were cleared faster in the mefl oquine-artesunate group ( 28 vs 35 days) and new gametocytes tended to appear more frequently in patients treated with dihydroartemisinin- piperaquine (day 7: 8 (3.6%) vs 2 (0.9%), RR: 3.84, 95%CI [0.82-17.87]). Adverse events such as anxiety and insomnia were significantly mo re frequent in the me floquine-artesunate group, both in adults and children. CO NCLUSION: Dihydroartemisinin-piper aquine is as effective as mefloquine-artesunate in treating uncomplicated P. falciparum ma laria but it is better tolerated and more affordable than mefloquine-artesuna te (US$1.0 versus US$18.65 on the local market). Therefore, it should be considered as a potential candidate for the first line treatment of P. falciparum malaria in Peru. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00373607 Department Medical Microbiology, Ra dboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. BACKGROUND: P. falciparum gametocytes may persist after treatment with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) plus artesuna te (AS) and contribute consid erably to malaria transmission. We determined the efficacy of SP+AS plus a single dose of primaquine (PQ, 0.75 mg/kg) on clearing gametocytaemia measured by mol ecular methods. METHODOLOGY: The study was conducted in Mnyuzi, an area of hyperendemic mala ria in north-eastern Tanzania. Children aged 3-15 years with uncomplicated P. falciparum mala ria with an asexual pa rasite density between 500-100,000 parasites/microL were randomized to SP+AS+PQ. P. gametocyte preval ence and real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (QT-NASBA). Haemoglobin levels (Hb) were address concerns about haemolysis in G6PD-deficient RESU LTS: QT-NASBA gametocyte prevalence was 88-91% at enrolment and decreased afterwards for both treatment arms. Gametocyte prevalence and density were significantly lower in children treated with SP+AS+PQ. On day 14 after treatment 3.9% (2/51) of the +PQ treated children harboured those treated with SP+AS (p<0.001). Hb levels were reduced in the week following treatment with SP+AS+PQ and this reduction was related to G6PD deficiency. The Hb levels of al l patients recovered to pre-treatment levels or greater within one month after treatment . CONCLUSIONS: PQ clears submicroscopic gametocytes after treatment with SP+AS and the persisting gametocytes circulated at densities that are unlikely to contribute to malaria tran smission. For individuals without severe anaemia, addition of a single dose of PQ to an efficaci ous antimalarial drug combination is a safe approach to reduce malaria transmission following treatment.

Marked differences in the prevalence of chloroquine resistance between urban and rural communities in Burkina Tropical Ruprecht-Karls-Un iversity, Heidelberg, Germany. peter.meissner@urz.uni-heidelberg.de BACKGROUND: Chloroquine (CQ) resistance has reached high levels in Africa in recent years. Little is known about variations of resistance between ur ban and rural areas. OBJECTIVES: To compare the rate s of in vivo resistance to CQ and the prevalences of the main molecular marker for CQ resistance am ong young children from urban and rural areas in Burkina Faso. METHODS: The curre nt analysis used the frame of a randomized controlled trial (ISRCTN27290841) on the combination CQ-methylen e blue (MB) (n=177) compared to CQ alone (n=45) in young children with uncomplicat ed malaria. We examined clinical and parasitological failure rates as well as the prev alence of the Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter gene (pfc rt) T76 mutation. RESULTS: Clinic al and parasitological failure rates of CQ-MB differed significantly between urban (70%) and rural areas (29%, p<0.0001). Likewise, CQ failure rates were higher in the urban setting. Matching this pattern, pfcrt T76 was more frequently seen among parasite strains fr om urban areas (81%) when compared to rural ones (64%, p=0.01). In the presence of parasites exhibiting pfcrt T76, the odds of overall clinical failure were increased to 2.6-fold ([1.33, 5.16], p(LR)=0.005). CQ was detected at baseline in 21% and 2% of children from th e urban and the rural study area, respectively (p(Chi)=0.002). CONCLUSION: Even within ci rcumscribed geographical areas, CQ efficacy can vary dramatically. The differences in the prevalence of pfcrt T76 and in CQ failure rates are probably explained by a higher drug pressure in the urban area co mpared to the rural study area. This finding has important implications for national malaria policies. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2008 Jan;52(1):237-43. Epub 2007 Oct 29. Pharmacokinetics and efficacy of pipe raquine and chloroquine in Melanesian of Medicine and Pharmacology, Universi ty of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.

Twenty-two children were randomized to 3 days of PQ phosphate at 20 mg/kg/day (12 mg of PQ base/kg/day) 62Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 coformulated with dihydroartemisinin (DHA-PQ), and twenty children were randomized to 3 days of CQ at 10 mg base/kg/day with a singl e dose of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (CQ-SP). After a 42-day intensive plasma by liquid chromatography. A two-compartment model with fi rst-order absorption was fitted to the PQ and CQ data. There were no significant differences in age, gender, body weight, or admission parasitemia between the two groups. The PCR-corrected 42-day adequate clinical and parasitological responses were 100% 94% for CQ-SP, but P. falciparum reinfections during follow-up we re common (33 and 18%, respect ively). For PQ, the median volume of distribution at steady state, allowing for bioavailability (Vss/F), was 431 liters/kg (interquartile range 0.85 0.67 to 1.06 liters/h/kg), the median distribution half-lif e (t 1/2 alpha) was 0.12 h (IQR, 0.05 to 0.66 h), and the median elimination half-life (t 1/2 beta) was 413 h (IQR, 318 to 516 h). For CQ, the median Vss/F was 154 liters /kg (IQR, 101 (IQR, 0.52 to 0.96 liters /h/kg), the median t 1/2 alpha was 0.43 h (IQR, 0.05 to 1.82 h), and the median t 1/2 beta was 233 h (IQR, 206 to 298 h). The noncompartmentally derived median DECQ t 1/2 beta was 290 h (IQR, 236 to 368 h). Combined molar concentrations of DECQ and CQ were higher than those of PQ during the elimination phase. Although PQ has a longer t 1/2 beta than CQ, its prompt distribution and lack of active metabolite may limit its posttreat ment malaria-suppressive properties.

In Papua, Indonesia, we assessed determinants of the therapeutic efficacy of DHP for uncomplicated malaria. Plasma piperaquine concentrations were measured on day 7 and day 28, and the cumulative risk of parasitological failure at day 42 was calculated us ing survival analysis. Of the 598 patients in the evaluable population 342 had infections with Plasmodium falciparum, 83 with Plasmodium vivax, and 173 with a mixture of both species. The unadjusted cumulative risks of recurrence were 7.0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.6 to 9.4%) 8.9% (95% CI: 6.0 to 12%) for P. vivax. After correcting for rein fections the risk of recrudescence with P. falciparum was 1.1% CI: 0.1 to 2.1%). The major determinant of parasitological failure was the plasma piperaquine concentration. A concentration below 30 ng/ml on day 7 was observed in 38% (21/56) of child ren less than 15 years old and 22% (31/140) of adults (P = 0.04), even though the overall dose (mg per kg of body weight) in children was 9% higher than that in adults (P < 0.001). Patients with piperaquine levels below 30 ng/ml were more likely to have a recurrence with P. falciparum (hazard ratio [HR] = 6.6 [95% CI : 1.9 to 23]; P = 0.003) or 63Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 P. vivax (HR = 9.0 [95% CI: 2.3 to 35]; P = 0.001).

In areas co-endemic for falciparum and vivax malaria incorrect differential diagnosis is always a risk. In Afghanistan the adoption of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus artesunate (SP+AS) as first-li ne falciparum treatment raises the prospect of a significant proportion of vivax malaria being misdiagnosed and treated with the combination. SP is considered to have lim ited efficacy against vivax malaria, and the efficacy of SP+AS against Plasmodium vivax has not been established in areas that are using SP+AS. A randomised, non-inferiority trial co mparing SP+AS with was undertaken on 190 vivax malaria pa tients in eastern Afghanistan. Standard WHO procedures for in vivo evaluation of antimalarial drugs were followed. A total of 180 individuals completed the trial to day 42. Using a per protocol analysis, both regimens resulted in > or =96% treatment success at 28 d, but significantly more cases failed in the CQ arm (46%) than in the SP+AS arm (24%) by day 42. In areas where vivax infecti ons might be misdiagnosed as falciparum infections and treated with SP+AS, patient manage ment would be as good, or better than, with the standard CQ treatment.

BACKGROUND: Although artemesinin derivatives are promising for the treatment of severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria, intravenous quinine remains the most affordable treatment. However, administration of intravenous quinine is often not feasible in rural areas in Africa because of the lack of simple equipment or trained staff. We compared the efficacy and safety of intrarectal quinine with those of intrave nous quinine in the treatment of childhood cerebral malaria. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial at Mulago Hospital (Kampala, Uganda), Uganda's national referral hospital, we studied 110 children aged 6 months to 5 years who had cerebral malaria. Pa tients were randomized to receive either intrarectal or intravenous quinine. Main outcome measures included parasite clearance time, fever clearance time, coma recovery time, time to sit unsupported, time to begin oral intake, time until oral quinine was tolerated, and death. RESULTS: Overall, there was no difference in the clinical and parasitological outcomes between the 2 groups (data are mean+/-standard deviation, intrarectal quinine group vs. intravenous h versus fever clearance time, 26.7+/-16.1 h versus 29.9+/-18.1 h; and parasite clearance time, 43.2+/-14.2 h versus 41.9+/-15.2 h. Mortality was similar in both groups; 4 of 56 patients in the intrarectal quinine group died, and 5 of 54 patients in the intravenous quinine gr oup died (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-5.2). Intrarectal quinine was well tolerated, and no major immediate adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Intrarectal quinine is efficacious and could be used as an alternative in the treatment of child hood cerebral malaria, es pecially in situations in which intravenous therapy is not feasible. Comment These results confirm a previous study on the sa fety and efficacy of quinine given rectally ( BMJ. 2006 May 6;332(7549):1055-9) and adds to the eviden ce on other antimalarials being used in suppository form, including dihydroartimisinin ( Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2007 Oct 24;6:138.

Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, effectively lowers ICP and is used to treat post- traumatic raised ICP. It is not clear whether intravenous mannitol given to children with cerebral malaria improves clinical outcome. The objective of this study was to dete rmine the effect of mannitol as adjunct therapy on the clinical outcome of children with cereb ral malaria. METHODS: This randomized double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial was carried out at the Emergency Paediatric ward of Mulago Hospital, Uganda's national referral and teaching hospital. One hundred and fifty six children aged 6 to 60 months with cerebral malaria were randomized to either one dose of mannitol 1 g/kg or placebo, in addition to intravenous quinine. Main outcome measures included coma recovery time; time to sit unsupported, begin oral intake; duration of hos pitalization; death and adverse effects. RESULTS: Time to regain consciousness (p = 0.11), sit unsupported (p = 0.81), time to start oral intake (p = 0.13) and total coma duration (p = 0.07) were si milar in both groups. There was no significant difference in the mortality between the placebo (13/80 or 16.3%) and mannitol (10/76 or 13.2%) groups: RR = 1.2 (CI 0.5-2.7). No adverse effects were observed after administration of mannitol. CONCLUSION: Mann itol had no significant impact on clinical outcome of cerebral malaria. It is difficu lt to recommend intravenous mannitol as adjunct therapy for childhood cerebral malaria. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2007 Oct 17;(4):CD005967. Artesunate versus quinine S Lalloo DG .

We sought evidence of superiority of artesunate compared with th e standard treatment quinine. OBJECTIVES: To compare artesunate with quinine for treati ng severe malaria. SE ARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (January 2007), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2006, I ssue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2007), EMBASE (1974 to January 2007), LILACS (1982 to January 2007), ISI Web of Science (1945 to January 2007), the metaRegister of Controlle d trials (mRCT), conference proceedings, and reference lists of articles. We contacted researchers and the World Health Organization. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled tr ials comparing intr avenous or intramuscular quinine for treating adults and children with severe malaria who are unable to ta ke medication by mout h. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors assessed the eligibility a nd methodological quality of trials, extracted and analysed data, and drafted the review. The th ird author contributed to the design and writing of the review. Death was the primary outcome. Dichotomous outcomes were summarized using relative risks and cont inuous outcomes by mean differences. Where appropriate, we combined 67Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 data in meta-analyses. Heterogeneity was inve stigated for the primary outcome using subgroup analyses. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials enroll ing 1938 participants (1664 adults and 274 children) met our inclusion criter ia. All six trials were conduct ed in Asia, and only one small trial enrolled only children. Five trials used in travenous artesunate and one trial intramuscular artesunate; all six used intravenous quinine. Treatment with artesunate significantly reduced the risk of death (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.75; 1938 pa rticipants, 6 trials), reduced parasite clearance time (WMD 8.14 h, 95% CI 11.55 to 4.73; 292 participants, 3 trials), and hypoglycaemia detected by routin e monitoring (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.87; 185 participants, 2 trials). There was no evidence of a difference in neurological sequelae, coma recovery time, time to hospital discharge, fever clearance time, or adverse effects other than hypoglycaemia. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous artesunate is the drug of choice for adults with severe malaria, particularly if acquired in Asia . This review did not identify sufficient data to make firm conclusions about the treatme nt of children or the effectiveness of intramuscular artesunate. There is an urgent need to compare the effects of artesunate with quinine in African children with severe malaria. The applicability of these results to Asian children and the ethics of fu rther research are points of debate. Malnutrition Indian J Med Res. 2007 Sep;126(3):199-203. A pilot study on the effects of curd (dahi) & leaf protein concentrate in children with protein energy malnutrition (PEM). Dewan P , of Paediatrics, University Colle ge of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: In protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) there is a significant impairment of immunity, both cell-mediated and humoral, which may be reversed with nutritional rehabilitation. With th e use of probiotics like curd (dahi) and micronutrient-rich leaf protein concentrate (LPC), this immune recove ry may be hastened. This study was conducted to assess the impact of supplementation of curd a nd LPC on nutritional status, and immunity as assessed by anthropometry, haemoglobin, ferritin levels, T- cell subpopulation and C-reactive protein (CRP), in children suffering from PEM. METHODS: Eighty moderate to severely malnourished children (1-5 yr) were randomized to receive either curd or LPC in addition to WHO recommended two-step diet over 15 days. Nutritional, immunological and haematological parameters were measured before and after supplementation and compared within the groups. RESULTS: The change in weight, haemoglobin level and CD4:CD8 T-cell subpopulation was significant in both the groups after supplementation. Response of CRP was blunted in PEM. Seru m ferritin decreased significantly after supplementation in both groups. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Curd and LPC when added to diet of malnourished children, may have therapeutic value by accelerating immune recovery. More studies need to be done on a larger sample to confirm these findings. 68Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Maternal care and maternal nutrition Am J Clin Nutr. 2008 Mar;87(3):704-11. Effects of prenatal food and micro nutrient supplementation on infant development: a randomized trial from the Maternal and Infant Nutrition Interventions, Matlab (MINIMat) study. Tofail Bangladesh, Dhaka, Bangladesh. ftofail@icddrb.org BACKGROUND: Few data exist for the effects of mu ltiple micronutrient (MM) or food supplementation to undernourished pregnant women on their offs prings' development. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the effect s on infant development of early (8-10 wk gestation) or usual ( approximately 17 wk gest ation) supplementation with food and MM, 30 mg Fe + 400 microg folate, or 60 mg Fe + 400 mi crog folate. DESIGN: A large, randomized, controlled trial of pregnancy supplementation was conducted in Bangladesh. A subsample of infants (n = 2853) were assessed on 2 problem-sol ving tests (support and c over tests), the motor index of the Bayley Scales of In fant Development, and Wolke's beha vior ratings at 7 mo of age. RESULTS: There were no signifi cant effects of any interven tion in the group as a whole. However, infants of undernourished mothers [body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) < 18.5] who received early food supplementation performed slightly but significantly (P = 0.035) better on the support test than did infants of mothers w ho received usual food supplementation (z score: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.33). There were no benefits in infants of higher-BMI mothers (P = 0.024 for BMI x food interaction). Children of lo w-BMI mothers who received MMs had slightly better motor scores (z score: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.037, 0.45) than did those who received 30 mg Fe + 400 microg folate, whereas other children did not benefit (P = 0.05 for both moto r scores and BMI x micronutrients and for activity and BMI x micronut rients). CONCLUSIONS: Small benefits from early food and MM supplementation were found in infants of low-BMI but not of high-BMI mothers. However, the benefits were of doubtful functi onal importance, and longer follow-up is required to determine programmatic implications. Lancet. 2008 Feb 9;371(9611):492-9. Effects of antenatal multiple micronut rient supplementation on children's weight and size at 2 years of age in Nepal: follow-up of a double-blind D . 69Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Mother and Infant Research Activ ities (MIRA), Kathmandu, Nepal. BACKGROUND: The negative effects of low birthw eight on the later hea lth of children in developing countries have been well studied. However, undertaki ng programmes to address this issue can be difficult since there is no simple correlation between incr easing birthweight and improving child health. In 2005, we published results of a randomised controlled trial in Nepal, in which 1200 women received either iron and fo lic acid or a supplement that provided the recommended daily allowance of 15 vitamins and minerals, over the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Here, we report on 2-3 years' follow-up of children born during the trial. METHODS: We visited children at home and obtained data for the primary outcomes of weight and height, for childhood illnesses, and maternal blood haemoglobin. The study is registered as an International Standa rd Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN88625934. FINDINGS: Between December, 2005, and December, 2006, we assessed 917 children (455 controls, 462 intervention) at a mean age of 2.5 years. Mean birthweight had been 77 g (95% CI 24-130) greater in the micronutrien t group than in controls. At 2.5 years old, controls weighed a mean of 10.7 kg (SD 1.38), and those in the intervention group 10.9 kg (SD 1.54). Children of women who had taken multiple micronutrient supplements during pregnancy were a mean 204 g (95% CI 27-381) heavier than controls. They also had greater measurements than co ntrols in the circumference of the head (2.4 mm [95% CI 0.6-4.3]), chest (3.2 mm [0.4-6.0]), and mid-upp er arm (2.4 mm [1.1-3.7 ]), and in triceps skinfold thickne ss (2.0 mm [0.0-0.4]). Systolic blood pressure wa s slightly lower in the intervention group (2.5 mm Hg [0.5-4.6]). INTERPRETATION: In a poor population, the effects of maternal multiple micronutrient supplementation on the fetus persisted into childhood, with increases in both weight and body size. These increases were small, however, since those exposed to micronutrients had an average of 2% higher weight than controls. The public-health implications of changes in weig ht and blood pressure need to be clarified through further follow-up. Comment This study from Nepal provides some of th e first evidence that maternal micronutrient supplementation may have beneficial effects on gr owth in early childhood.

International Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B), Dhaka, Bangladesh. skroy@icddrb.org BACKGROUND: The rate of malnutrition among women in Bangladesh is high, but 70Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 historically there has not been a specific program focusing on th e improvement of the nutritional status of Bangladeshi women. OB JECTIVE: To observe changes in the nutritional status of destitute women of the Rural Maintenance Pr ogramme (RMP) by incorp orating a health and nutrition intervention package with RMP ongoing ac tivities. METHODS: An intervention study involving 1,275 poor destitute women was conducted from July 2004 to June 2005 in 17 districts in Bangladesh under two field offi ces, Mymensingh and Jessore, covering 8 and 9 districts, respectively. The respondents were di vided into intervention, comparison, and control groups. All participants in the in tervention and comparison groups we re paid as part of the RMP and received weekly 30-minute nutrition interventions for 7 w eeks in addition to routine training. The comparison group also received RM P training. The control group consisted of women with similar demographic characteristics to the intervention and comparison groups who did not receive pay or any intervention. The intervention was a unique combination of the three components of the UNICEF triangle model (food security, caring prac tices, and disease control). Data on socioeconomic and anthropometric ch aracteristics, immuni zation, and vitamin A capsule intake were also collected with the use of a structured que stionnaire. RESULTS: After the intervention, the mean body weight had significantly increased by 1,333 g in the intervention group and had decreased by 277 g in the control group and 147 g in the comparison group. The body mass index of women in the intervention group had also significantly increased at the end of the study (p < .001). There was a significant increase in the intake of iodized salt in the in tervention group as well as increase d immunization coverage in all groups. Intake of the first vitamin A capsule by children increased (from 60% to 97%) in the intervention group only. CONCLUSIONS: The nutrition pilot interv ention was highly effective in improving the nutritional status of women in the RMP. Lancet. 2007 Nov 10;370(9599):1629-37. Treatment of postnatal depression in low-income mothers in primary-care clinics in Santiago, Chile: a randomised controlled trial. Medicina, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile. BACKGROUND: The optimum way to improve th e recognition and treatment of postnatal depression in developing countries is uncer tain. We compared the effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention with usual care to treat postnatal depression in low-income mothers in primary-care clinics in Santia go, Chile. METHODS: 230 mothers with major depression attending postnatal clinics were randomly allocated to either a multicomponent intervention (n=114) or usual care (n=116). The multicomponent intervention involved a psychoeducational group, treatmen t adherence support, and pharmacotherapy if needed. Usual care included all services normally available in th e clinics, including anti depressant drugs, brief psychotherapeutic interventions, medical consul tations, or external referral for specialty treatment. The primary outcome measure was th e Edinburgh postnatal de pression scale (EPDS) 71Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 score at 3 and 6 months after randomisation. Anal ysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with Clinical Trials.gov, number NCT00518830. FINDI NGS: 208 (90%) of women randomly assigned to treatment groups completed assessments. The crude mean EPDS score was lower for the multicomponent intervention group than for the usual care group at 3 months (8.5 [95% CI 7.2-9.7] vs 12.8 [11.3-14.1]). A lthough these differences between groups decreased by 6 months, EPDS score remained better in multicomponent intervention group than in usual care group (10.9 [9.6-12.2] vs 12.5 [11.1-13.8] ). The adjusted difference in mean EPDS between the two groups at 3 months was -4.5 (9 5% CI -6.3 to -2.7; p<0.0001). The decrease in the number of women taking antidepressants afte r 3 months was greater in the intervention group than in the usual care group (multicompone nt intervention from INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that low-income mothers with depression and who have newly born children could be effec tively helped, even in low-income settings, through multicomponent interventions. Further refi nements to this intervention are needed to ensure treatment compliance after the acute phase. Obstet Gynecol. 2007 Nov;110(5):989-97. Predictors of stillbirth in JS , Goldenberg RL . Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia. bchi@cidrz.org OBJECTIVE: To describe the inci dence and predictors in virus (HIV)-inf ected African cohort. METHODS: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 024 was a randomized controlled trial of empiric antibiotics to reduce chorioamnionitis-r elated perinatal HIV transmission. A proportion of HIV-uninfected individuals we re enrolled to reduce community-based stigma surrounding the trial. For this analysis, only women who gave birth to singleton infants were included. RESULTS: Of 2,659 women enrolled, 2,434 (92%) moth er- child pairs met inclusion criteria. Of these, 2,099 (86%) infants were born to HI V-infected women, and 335 (14%) were born to HIV-uninfected women. The overall stillbir th rate was 32.9 per 1,000 deliveries (95% confidence [CI] 26.1-40.7). analyses, 20.9, 95% 5.1-86.2), and marked polymorphonuclear infiltration on pl acental histology (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.7-5.2). When compared with pregnancies longer than 37 w eeks, those at 34-37 weeks (OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.8- 3.4) and those at less than 34 weeks (OR 22.8, 95% CI 13.6-38.2) appeared more likely to result in stillborn delivery. Human immunodeficiency virus infection was not associated with a greater risk for stillbirth in either univariable (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.7-3.0) or multivariable (adjusted OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.38-3.26) analysis. Among HIV-infect ed women, however, decreasing CD4 cell count was inversely related to st illbirth risk (P=.009). CONCLUSI ON: In this large cohort, HIV infection was not associated with increased stillbirth risk. Further work is needed to elucidate 72Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 the relationship between chorioamnionitis and stillbirth in African populations. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: vaginal and neonatal wipes in home births in Pakistan: a randomized controlled Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan. OBJECTIVE: To assess tolerance and safety of 0.6% chlorhexidine vaginal and neonatal wipes to improve perinatal outcomes in home deliveries in Pakistan and the ability of traditional birth attendants and project staff to perform a ra ndomized trial of this intervention. METHODS: Focus groups of pregnant and nonpregnant women a nd in-depth interviews of traditional birth attendants explored barr iers to the use of chlorhexidine wi pes. Then, a study was performed of women delivering at home attended by traditional birth attendants. Consenting women were randomly assigned to receive either 0.6% chlorh exidine or saline vaginal and neonatal wipes. Women and their infants were followed up on postpartum days 7, 14, and 28. Acceptability and tolerance of vaginal and neonata l wipes, as well as maternal and neonatal outcomes, were assessed. RESULTS: The focus groups and interv iews indicated that the chlorhexidine intervention would be acceptable to women and their providers. Of the 213 eligible pregnant women approached, 203 (95%) gave informed co nsent and were enrolled and allocated to groups. Traditional birth attendants had no difficu lty administering chlorhexidine vaginal and neonatal wipes in a home setting. Of the 203 births, 103 (51%) of wh om received 0.6% chlorhexidine, there were no al lergic reactions, vaginal itchi ng, burning, or requests for study termination. Follow-up at 28 days postpartum wa s more than 95%. Although this study was not powered to show significant differences in neonatal outcomes between treatment groups, the lower rates of some neonatal adverse clinical outcomes in the chlorhexidine group were encouraging. CONCLUSION: Use of 0.6% chlorh exidine vaginal and neonatal wipes for the prevention of neonatal infection is well-tolerated and seems safe. A trial of this intervention by traditional birth attendants in a home-delive ry setting is feasible. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: OF EVIDENCE: I. Randomised controlled trial of two ante natal care models in rural Zimbabwe. 73Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Majoko F , G . Department of Women's & Children's Health, Section for International Maternal & Child Health, Uppsala University, Uppsal a, Sweden. majokof 215@doctors.org.uk OBJECTIVE: To compare five-visit antenatal car e (ANC) model with speci fied goals with the standard model in a rural area in Zimbabwe. DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial with the clinic as the randomisation unit. SETTING: Primary care setting in a developing country where care was provided by nur se-midwives. POPULATION: Women booking for ANC in the clinics were eligible. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Number of antenatal visits, antepartum and intrapartum referrals, utilization of health centre for delivery and perinatal outcomes. METHODS: Twenty-three rural health centres were stratified prior to random allocation to the new (n = 11) or standard (n = 12) model of care. RESULTS: We recruited 13,517 women (new, n = 6897 and standard, n = 6620) in the study, and 78% (10,572) of their pregnancy records were retrieved. There was no difference in median maternal age, parity and gestational age at booking between women in the standard model and those in the new model. The median number of visits was four for both mode ls. The proportion of women with five or less visits was 77% in the new and 69% in the standard model (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.08-2.2). The likelihood of haemoglobin testing was higher in the new mo del (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.0-5.7) but unchanged for syphilis testing. There were fewer intrapartu m transfers (5.4 versus 7.9% [OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.44-0.98]) in the new model but no difference in an tepartum or postpartum transfers. There was no difference in rates of preterm delivery or low birthweight. The perinatal mortality was 25/1000 in standard model and 28/1000 in new model. CONCLUSION: In Gutu district, a focused five-visit schedule did not change the number of contacts but was more effective as expressed by increased adherence to procedures and better use of institutional health care. Measles Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2008 Jul 16;(3):CD001477. Antibiotics for preventing complications in children with measles. Kabra SK , Lodha Pulmonology Division, Depa rtment of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, India, 110029. BACKGROUND: Measles is the le ading killer among vaccine-preve ntable diseases, responsible for an estimated 44% of the 1.7 million vaccine -preventable deaths among children annually. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of antibiotics given to children with measles to prevent complications and reduce pneumonia, other mo rbidities and mortalit y. SEARCH STRATEGY: In this 2008 update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 1) MEDLINE ( 1966 to January week 1, 2008), EMBASE (1980 to December 2007) and the National Research Register (Issue 3, 2007). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing antibiotics with placebo or no treatment to prevent compli cations in children with measles. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review aut hors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. MA IN RESULTS: Seven trials with 1 385 children were included. Pooled 74Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 study data showed that the incidence of pneumon ia was lower in the treatment group compared to the control group. However, the difference was not stat istically significant. In children who received antibiotics, 1.9% developed pne umonia, while in the control group 6% developed pneumonia (OR 0.28; 95% CI 0.06 to 1.25). The one trial that showed an increase in the rate of pneumonia with antibiotics was c onducted in 1942 and compared oral sulfathiazole with symptomatic treatment. If the results of this trial are removed from the meta-analysis, and the remaining six studies are combined, there is a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of pneumonia in children recei ving antibiotics (OR 0.17; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.65). The number needed to treat to prevent one episode of pneumonia is 24 patients. The incidence of other complications was significantly lower in children receiving antibiotics: purulent otitis media (OR 0.34; tonsillitis (OR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.72). There was no difference in the incidence of conjunctivitis (OR 0.39 ; 95% CI 0.15 to 1.0), diarrhea (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.23 to 1.22) or cr oup (OR 0.16; 95% CI 0.01 to 4.06). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review suggests a beneficial effe ct of antibiotics in preventing complications such as pneumonia, purulent otit is media and tonsillitis in children with measles. On the basis of this review, it is not possibl e to give definitive guidelines on the type of antibiotic, duration, or the day of initiation. Us e of penicillin or co-trimoxazole may be considered. There is a need to generate more evidence by well planned RCTs to answer these questions. Neonatal care Lancet. 2008 Jun 7;371(9628):1936-44.*** Effect of community-based newborn-care intervention package implemented through two service-delivery strategies in Sylhet district, Bangladesh: a , Black RE ; Projahnmo Study Group .Collaborators (22) Ahmed J , Alam A , Ali NA H , Zaman K . Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA. abaqui@jhsph.edu BACKGROUND: Neonatal mortality accounts for a high proportion of deaths in children under the age of 5 years in Bangladesh. Therefore the project for advancing the health of newborns and mothers (Projahnmo) implemented a co mmunity-based interv ention package through government non-government to reduce neonatal mortality. METHODS: In Sylhet district, 24 clusters (wit h a population of about 20 000 each) were randomly assigned in equal numbers to one of two intervention arms or to the comparison arm. Because of the study design, masking was not feasible. All married women of reproductive age (15-49 years) were eligible to participate. In the home-care arm, female community 75Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 health workers (one per 4000 population) identi fied pregnant women, made two antenatal home visits to promote birth and newborn-care preparedness, made postnatal home visits to assess newborns on the first, third, and se venth days of birth, and referred or treated sick neonates. In the comm unity-care arm, birth and newborn-care preparedness and careseeking from qualified providers were prom oted solely through group sessions held by female and male community mobilisers. The primary outcome was reduction in neonatal mortality. Analysis was by intention to treat. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number 00198705. FINDINGS: The numbe r of clusters per arm was eight. The number of participants was 36059, 40159, and 37598 in the home -care, community-care, and comparison arms, respectively, with 14 769, 16 325, and 15 350 livebirths, respectively. In the last 6 months of the 30-month intervention, neon atal mortality rates were 29.2 per 1000, 45.2 per 1000, and 43.5 per 1000 in the home-care, co mmunity-care, and comparison arms, respectively. Neonatal mortality was reduced in the home-care arm by 34% (adjusted relative risk 0.66; 95% CI 0.47-0.93) during the last 6 months versus that in the comparison arm. No mortality reduction was noted in the commu nity-care arm (0.95; 0.69-1.31). INTERPRETATION: A home-care strategy to promote an integrated package of preventive and curative newborn care is effec tive in reducing neonatal mortality in communities with a weak health system, low health-care use, and high neonatal mortality. Comment This important study shows that provision of a package of home-based antenatal care and care in the week after birth reduces neonatal morta lity. In the home-based arm of this trial community health workers (CHWs) had 6 weeks training in communication, provision of essential newborn care, clinical assessment of neonates, and manageme nt of sick neonates with an algorithm from IMCI. The CHWs id entified pregnancies duri ng visits to each household every 2 months, and provided 2 antenatal and 3 early postnatal home visits, and gave iron and folic acid supplements. The CHWs identified very sick newborns and gave IM antibiotics and referred babies on. Such models of home based care have been successful in other countries; India and Nepal particularly.

Ahmed AS SK , , Darmstadt GL . of Institute of Child Health, Dhaka Shishu Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Oil massage of newborns has been practised for generations in the Indian sub-continent; however, oils may vary from potentially beneficial, e.g. sunflower seed oil, to potentially toxic, e.g. mustard oil. The study was carried out to gain insights into oil-massage practices and acceptability of skin barrier-enhancing emo llients in young, preterm Bangladeshi neonates. Preterm infants of <33 weeks gestational age we re randomized to high-linoleate sunflower seed oil, Aquaphor Original Emollient Ointment, or the comparison group (usual care). A survey was administered at admission to assess routine skin-care practices prio r to admission and at discharge to assess acceptability of emollient therapy during hospitalization. Oil massage was given to 83 (21%) of 405 babies before hos pital admission, 86% (71/ 83) of whom were 76Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 delivered at home. Application of oil, most commonly mustar d oil (88%, 73/83), was started within one hour of birth in 51 cases (61%) and was applied al l over the body (89%, 74/83) one to six (mean 2.2) times before admission. Of infants who received emollient therapy in the hospital, 42% (n=32) of mothers reported that the emollient applied in the hospital was better than that available at home, and only 29% would us e the same oil (i.e. mustard oil) in the future as used previously at home. No problems resulted from use of emollient in the hospital. Topical therapy with sunflower seed oil or Aquaphor was perceived by many familie s to be superior to mustard oil. If caregivers and health professionals can be mo tivated to use inexpensive, available emollients, such as sunflower seed oil that are beneficial, emollient therapy could have substantial public-health benefit.

Department of International Health E8153, Bloom berg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, 615 North Wolfe St, Baltim ore, MD 21205, USA. gdarmsta@jhsph.edu OBJECTIVE: Skin barrier therapy during the neona tal period, when the skin barrier is most highly compromised and the risk of death is greatest, has been shown to have a number of potential benefits, including reduced risk of nosocomial sepsis. Topical application of emollients that augment skin barrier function was evaluated as a strategy for improving survival rates among hospitalized preterm infants in Banglad esh. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical trial was conducted in the special care nurser y at Dhaka Shishu (Children) Hospital, the largest tertiary care children's hospital in Bangladesh. Preterm infants (gestational age: < or = 33 weeks; N = 497) receiv ed daily topical applications of sunflower seed oil or Aquaphor ointment. Neonatal mort ality rates were compared in an intent-to- treat analysis with a control group that did not receive emollient therapy. RESULTS: Treatment with sunflower seed oil resulted in a statistically significant 26% reduction in mortality rates, compared with infants not receiving topical emollient therapy. Aquaphor therapy also significantly reduced mortality rates, by 32%. CONCLUSIONS: Topical therapy with skin barrier-enhancing emo llients improved survival rates among preterm hospitalized infants in Bangladesh. This study pr ovides strong evidence for the implementation of topical therapy for high-risk pret erm neonates in developing countries. Comment In this study emollient was applied to the enti re body surface, except for the scalp and face, 3 times per day for the first 14 days and then 2 times per day until discharge from hospital. The overall mortality rate among all neonates enro lled in the trial was very high (64%), but was significantly lower in the subjects who received the emollient. This was an unblinded trial, and it is possible that there were other differences, such as better hand-washing prior to touching babies (which was emphasized to the study nurses applying the emollient), or even the effect of massage. Nevertheless it is an important st udy, showing that, under the right conditions, 77Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 sunflower oil as a skin emollient may reduce neo natal case fatatality rates in nurseries where resources are limited aqnd ca se fatality rates are high.

London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medici ne, University of London, London, UK, and College of Health Sciences, Tour o University, Vallejo, CA, USA. OBJECTIVES: To assess newborn care-seeking pr actices in a rural area of Ghana where most births take place at home in order to inform pot ential strategies for reducing newborn mortality. METHODS: Qualitative, ethnographic study with quant itative data from a birth cohort collected as part of the surveillance sy stem of an ongoing randomized cont rolled trial. Data collected comprised 84 h of participant obs ervation (including following an ill newborn through a hospital visit), 14 in-depth interviews with key informants (older mo thers and grandmothers), 45 semistructured interviews with mothers, 28 cas e histories from women who had recently given birth and 32 expert interviews w ith local health providers. Thirt een focus groups were held with men and women, and narrative hist ories of newborn deaths were taken from eight women. Birth cohort data came from 2878 singlet ons born alive in the study dist rict within the year July 2003- June 2004. RESULTS: Significant delays in care seeking for ill newborns occur in Kintampo District, Ghana. 2.1% of 2878 newborns in the birth cohort had a serious illness during the first 4 weeks of life, but care was on ly sought outside the home for 61% of those and from a doctor or hospital for 39%. Barriers to prompt allopathic care seeking include sequential care-seeking practices, with often ex clusive use of traditional medicine as first- line treatment for 7 days, previous negative ex periences with health service facilities, financial constraints and remoten ess from health facilities. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in care seeking are urgently needed. Families sh ould be urged to seek medical care for any symptom of illness in a newborn; financial a nd socio-cultural barriers to care seeking for newborns must be addressed in order to improve neonatal survival. Comment Useful information on knowledge, attitudes and practices can be derived from effectiveness trials. This trial describes important barriers to seeking care for sick newborns, which will be common to many poor regions, and are crucial to address if newborns are to access known effective interventions, a nd if neonatal mortality rates in the poorest regions of the world are to be reduced.

Department of Neonatology, Seth GS Medical College and KEM Hospital, Mumbai, India. raosumanv@rediffmail.com OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of Ka ngaroo mother care (K MC) and conventional methods of care (CMC) on grow th in LBW babies (<2000 g). STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Level III NICU of a teaching institution in western India. SUBJECTS: 206 neonates with birth weight < 2000 g. INTERVENTION: The subjects were randomized into two groups: the intervention group (KMC-103) received Kangaroo mother care. The control group (CMC: 103) received conventional care. OUTCOME MEASURES: Growth, as measured by average daily weight gain and by other anthropometrical parameters at 40 weeks postmenstrual age in preterm babies and at 2500 g in term SGA infants was assessed. RESULTS: The KMC babies had better average we ight gain per day (KMC: 23.99 g vs CMC: 15.58 g, P< 0.0001). The weekly increment s in head circumference (KMC: 0.75 cm vs CMC: 0.49 cm, P = 0.02) and length (KMC : 0.99 cm vs CMC: 0.7 cm, P = 0.008) were higher in the KMC group. A significantly higher number of babies in the CMC group suffered from hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and sepsis. There was no effect on time to discharge. More KMC babies were exclusively breastfed at the end of the study (98% vs 76%). KMC was acceptable to most mothers and famili es at home. CONCLUSION: Kangaroo mother care improves growth and reduces morbidities in low birth wei ght infants. It is simple, acceptable to mothers and can be continued at home.

PGIMS, Rohtak, g_gathwala@hotmail.com OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Kangaroo mother care (KMC) facilitates mother baby attachment in low birth weight infants. METHODS: Over 16 month period 110 neonates were randomized into kangaroo mother care group and control group using a random number table. The kangaroo group was subjected to Kangaroo mother care for at least 6 hours per day. The babies also received kangaroo care after shifti ng out from NICU and at home. The control group received standard care (incuba tor or open care system). After 3 months followup, structured maternal interview was conducted to assess attachment between mothers and their babies. RESULTS: Mean birth weight was 1.69 +/- 0.11 Kg in KMC group compared to 1.690 0.12 Kg in control group (p>0.05). Mean gestati onal age was 35.48 +/- 1.20 week in KMC group and 35.04+/-1.09 week in the control group (p>0.05). KMC was initiated at a mean age of 1.72+/- 0.45 days. The duration of KMC in first month was 10.21+/-1.50 hour, in the 2nd month was 10.03+/-1.57 hour and in the 3rd month was 8.97+/-1.37 hours. The duration of hospital stay 79Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 was significantly shorter in the KMC group (3.56+/-0.57 days) compared to control group (6.80+/-1.30 days). The total attachment score (24.46+/-1.64) in the KMC group was significantly higher than that obtained in control group (18.22+/-1.79, p< 0.001). In KMC group, mother was more often the main caretaker of the baby. Mothers were significantly more involved in care taking activities like bathing, diapering, sleeping with their babies and spent more time beyond usual care taking. They went out without their babies less often and only for unavoidable reasons. They derived greater pl easure from their babies. CONCLUSION: KMC facilitates mother baby attachment in low birth weight infants. Comment The two studies above on Kangaroo Mother Care (K MC) in low birth weight babies show its value in: higher weight gain, head growth, mo re breast feeding, and fewer complications of sepsis, hypothermia and hypoglycaemia. Most st udies of KMC have been done in relatively low-risk populations of babies, where the neonatal mortality rate is much less than, for example that reported in the Skin Emollie nt study from Bangladesh (above). The role of KMC is certain for low-risk babies, but needs to be further evaluated in babies at high risk of mortality in resource limited settings.

Department of Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia. nemyun_boo@imu.edu.my AIM: To compare weight gain and head grow th in very-low-birthweight (VLBW, <1501 g) infants with or without exposure to short duration of skin-to-skin contact (STSC) during their stay in a neonatal intensive care unit. METHOD S: Stable VLBW infants were randomised into either STSC or control group. Parents of the ST SC group were encouraged to provide STSC for at least 1 h daily. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-six infants were randomised, but only 126 were enrolled (STSC group: n = 64; Controls: n = 62). Infants in the STSC group had better mean weekly increase in head circu mference (1.0 cm (SD = 0.3) vs. 0.7 cm (SD = 0.3); P < 0.0001) and higher breastfeeding rate at discharge (29.7% vs. 14.5%; P = 0.04). Although the mean duration of maternal educati on was longer in STSC (13.0 vs. 12.1 years; P = 0.04) than in controls, linear regression analysis showed th at the significant predictors associated with weekly head growth were e xposure to (unstandardised coefficient: 0.3; P < 0.0001) and head circumference of infants at the time (unstandardised number of years of maternal education was not a significant predictor. Logistic regression analysis showed that the only significant predictors of succe ssful breastfeeding at discharge were receiving expressed milk en rollment (adjusted OR: 4.1; 95% CI: 1.4, 11.7; P = 0.009) and receiving expressed breast milk during intervention period (adjusted OR: 8.3; 95% 80Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 CI: 2.8, 24.4; P < 0.0001); exposure to STSC and ma ternal education we re not significant predictors.

Several large, randomized controlle d trials have demonstrated the efficacy of topiramate in migraine prophylaxis in adults. However, there ar e limited data about the use of topiramate in migraine prophylaxis in children. We conducte d this single-center , double-blind, placebo- controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topiramate in the prophylaxis of migraine in children. A total of 44 children with migraine were randomized using random number tables to receive topiramate (n = 22) or pla cebo (n = 22). The total duration of treatment was 4 months, including a baseline period of 1 month during which topiramate was titrated weekly in 25-mg increments to 100 mg/d in 2 di vided doses or to the maximum tolerated dose. The titration was followed by a 12-week maintena nce phase during which topiramate was given in 2 divided doses. The primary outcome measur es were the reduction in the mean migraine frequency and severity of headache. Secondary outcome measures included the number of times analgesics were required for a month for acute attacks and functional disability. Functional disability was measured by comparing school ab senteeism and Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (PedMIDAS). The decrease in mean (+/-SD) monthly migraine frequency from 16.14 (+/-9.35) at baseline to 4.27 (+/-1.95) at the end of the study in the topiramate group was significantly greater as compared with a decrease from 13.38 (+/-7.78) to 7.48 (+/-5.94) at the end of the study in the placebo group (P = .025). The difference in number of rescue medications used for topiramate and pl acebo was not statistica lly significant (P = .059). There was a statistically signifi cant decrease in th e PedMIDAS score from 50.66 (+/-32.1) to 10.42 (+/-6.39) at the end of the study in the topiramate group compared with a decrease from 42.66 (+/-27.5) to 23.7 (+/-19.1) at the end of 4 months in the placebo group (P = .003). The decrease in school absenteeism was significant w ith topiramate compared with placebo (P = .002). Weight loss, decreased concentration in sc hool, sedation, and parasthesias were important side effects with topiramate. Mo st of these side effects were mild to moderate and were not significant enough to cause dropout from the study. 81Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Jpn J Infect Dis. 2008 Jan;61(1):18-24. Clinical application of reverse-transcr iption polymerase chain reaction and intravenous immunoglobulin for of Pediatrics, Veterans Ge neral Hospital-Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Although polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a highl y sensitive procedure for the diagnosis of enteroviruses, it has never been systemically app lied to the treatment of enteroviral encephalitis using intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). We conducted a comparison of reverse transcription (RT)-PCR of cerebrospinal flui d (CSF) with traditional viral isolation to guide IVIg treatment . Seventy-five patients were enrolled and classified into three groups: one group with clinical manifestations of enteroviral infections and two without. The latter two groups were separate d on the basis of whether IVIg treatment was guided by RT-PCR or virus culture assay. CSF specimens from the 18 confirmed cases of en teroviral encephalitis were RT-PCR positive for enterovirus in all but one case. Of the remaining 57 cases of nonenteroviral encephalitis, only 4 were positive for enterovirus RT-PCR. One patient in the group of IVIg treatment guided by viral isolation subsequently displayed a sequel of epilepsy. No patients in the IVIg treatment groups guide d by RT-PCR had any neurological sequelae. In conclusion, the use of RT-PCR allowed rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of enteroviral RNA in CSF. When used to guide IVIg trea tment, RT-PCR may shorten hospitalization and improve patients wi th enteroviral encephalitis. Neurocysticercosis J Assoc Physicians India. 2007 Jun;55:419-24. Short course of oral prednisolone on disappearance of lesion and seizure recurrence in patients of solitary cyst icercal granuloma with single small enhancing CT lesion: randomized prospective study. Kishore D , Misra S . Department of Neurology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi - 221 005, India. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the eff ect of a short course of oral prednisolone on disappearance of lesion and seizure recurrence in newly diagnos ed patients with single small enhancing CT lesion. METHODS: In this open-label, randomized, prospective follow-up study, patients of new-onset seizures and a cysticercus gr anuloma presenting as single enhancing computed tomography detected lesion were randomly divided in two groups to receive either antiepileptic monotherapy (Group A) or antiepileptic drugs with oral prednisolone in a dose of 1 mg/kg body weight for 7 days a nd tapering off dose in next 3 days (Group B). 82Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Repeat CT scan was performed on 8th-12th w eek to know radiological state of lesion. The patients were followed up for 1 year for seizure recurrence. RESULTS: The majority of patients were in second decade. Male: female ratio 1.56: 1. Mean number of seizure episodes was 4.33 +/- 3.50 in group A and 4.23 +/- 3.97 in group B. Partial seizure were the most common presentation (85%). 72% patients presented with single seizure or seizure in cluster. Solitary ring lesion was the commonest (69%) CT finding, most of them were located in parietal lobe (52%). Follow up CT scan showed complete resoluti on of lesion in 60.86% of total [group A (n = 47), 32 patients, 68.08%; group B (n = 45), 24 patients, 53.33%]. Significant difference in group A and B regarding lesion resolution was observed (chi2 = 5.926, d.f. = 1) p < 0.05. Clinical follow up showed seizure recu rrence in group A - 5 patients (10.63%), in group B - 12 patients (26.66%). Statistically significant higher number of seizure recurrences were noted in group B as compared to group A (chi2 = 3.93, d.f. = 1) p < 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term oral prednisolone along with antiepileptic drugs helps in rapid resolution of single small enhancing lesi ons in patient with newly diagnosed seizure disorder with good clinical outcome.

Fortifying brown bread with sodium iron EDTA, ferrous fumarate, or electrolytic iron does not affect iron status in South African schoolchildren. van Stuijvenberg ME , Smuts CM , Lombard . Nutritional Intervention Research Unit, Medica l Research Council, Cape Town, South Africa. lize.van.stuijvenberg@mrc.ac.za The choice of iron fortificant usually represen ts a balance between bioavailability of the compound and its tendency to cause organoleptic problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of sodium iron EDTA (N aFeEDTA) and ferrous fumarate at levels compatible with South African brown bread (10 mg/kg flour for NaFeEDTA and 20 mg/kg flour for ferrous fumarate) in a randomi zed controlled trial; electrolytic iron was evaluated at the level currently used in South Africa (35 mg/kg flour). Schoolchildren (n = 361), aged 6-11 y, from a low socioeconomic community with hemogl obin (Hb) < or = 125 g/L were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups that received 4 sl ices of brown bread s upplying either: 1) no fortification iron 2) 2.35 mg iron as NaFeED TA; 3) 4.70 mg iron as ferrous fumarate; and 4) 8.30 mg iron as electrolytic iron per intervention day. These amounts simulated a bread intake of 6 slices per day over the 34-wk study period at fortification levels of 0, 10, 20, and 35 mg/kg flour, respectively. Hb concentration and iron status were assessed at baseline and after 34 wk of intervention. The iron interventions di d not affect Hb concentration, transferrin 83Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 or serum ferritin, iron, or transferrin receptor concentr ations relative to the control group. Our results suggest that electrolytic iron at the level currently used in South Africa is not effective in improving iron or Hb stat us. Neither do NaFeEDTA or ferrous fumarate appear to be suitable alternatives for the fortification of wheat flour when included at levels that do not cause color changes.

Asibey-Berko E , . of Nutrition and Food Science, University of Ghana, OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of double-fo rtified salt (DFS) on the anaemia and iodine deficiency (ID) status of women and their children. DE SIGN: Double-blind randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Sekyere West District of Ghana. SU BJECTS: In this eight-month trial, mildly anaemic or non-anaemic, non- non-lactating women were randomised into three groups receiving: DFS pl us weekly placebo (n = 61); iodised salt plus weekly 70 mg iron supplement (n = 65); or iodised salt (IS) plus weekly placebo (control group, n = 58). Correspondingly, their mildly an aemic and non-anaemic children aged 1-5 years were randomised into two groups receiving either the DFS (n = 23) or IS alone (control group, n = 59). RESULTS: At the end of the intervention, prevalence of anaemia in women remained unchanged in the DFS or IS plus weekly iron supplement group, but significantly increased by 19.5% in the control group (P = 0.039). In children, prevalence of anaemia in the DFS group signifi cantly decreased by 21.7% (P = 0.025) while no change was observed in the control group. ID decr eased significantly in all groups of women (P < 0.001) and children (P < 0.05), with no difference among groups of women and children. CONCLUSION: While the use of DFS prevented anaemia in women, it had a significant role in both the prevention and treatment of anaemia in children. Both the DFS and IS significantly reduced ID in wome n and children to a similar degree. Biol Trace Elem Res. 2008 Mar;121(3):193-204. Epub 2008 Jan 8. Apparent efficacy of food-based calcium supplementation in preventing rickets in Bangladesh. Combs N P , Hunt C , Watts J . Division of Nutritional Sciences, Co rnell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA. gerald.combs@ars.usda.gov To determine whether increased Ca intakes can pr event rickets in a susc eptible group of children living in a rickets-endemic area of Bangladesh, we conducted a 13-month long, double-blind, 84Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 clinical trial with 1-to 5-year-old children who did not present with rickets but ranked in the upper decile of plasma alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity of a screening cohort of 1,749 children. A total of 158 children were randomized to a milk-powder-based dietary supplement given daily, 6 days/week, and providing either 50, 250, or 500 mg Ca, or 500 mg Ca plus multivitamins, iron, and zinc . Upon initial screen ing, 194 healthy children presented with no rachitic leg signs and had se rum AP in the upper dec ile (>260 u/dl) of the cohort. When 183 of those subjects were re-s creened after a 7-month pre-trial period, 23 (12.6%) had developed rachitic leg signs, suggesti ng an annual risk of 21.5 % in this cohort. Of those still not presenti ng with leg signs and completing 13 mo nths of dietary intervention, none showed rachitic leg signs, none showed significant radiological evidence of active rickets, and all showed carpal ossification normal for age after that intervention. These results are consistent with even the lowest amount of supplemental Ca (50 mg/day) being useful in supporting normal bone development in this high-risk population.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of micronut rient fortified sugar candies in improving the iron and vitamin A status in children aged 3 to 6 years. DESIGN: Triple blind randomized controlled trial. SETTINGS: A nganwadis and preparatory schools in rural Haryana. METHODS: 410 children were randomized in four gr oups. One group received full dose candy (vitamin A 1000 IU and 14 mg elemental iron) daily, the second group received full dose candy for 3 days a week, the third group received half dose candy (vitamin A 500 IU and 7 mg elemental iron) daily and the fourth received placebo. The candies were provided to children under supervision of field workers. Hemoglobin, S. ferritin, S. retinol and S. retinol binding protein levels were estimated at baselin e and after 13 weeks of intervention. RESULTS: The increase in hemoglobin was least in the placebo group (0.3 g/dL) as compared to the two full dose groups (1.15-1.18 g/dL, P <; 0.001). Among anemic children, the increase in hemoglobin was about 2 g/dL in the full dose group and 0.7g/dL in the placebo group (P <; 0.001). S. ferritin levels increased significantly on ly in the full dose daily group ( p <; 0.05). The prevalence of anemia decreased from around 50% at baseline to 9.6% in the full dose daily group (p <; 0.01). Based on the S. retinol levels, the study area wa s not vitamin A deficient and the intervention did not result in a significant improvement in the vitamin A status of the children. CONCLUSION: Micronutrient fortified candies were effective in improving the hemoglobin level and decreasing anemia prevalence. It could serve as a suitable vehicle for micronutrient supplementation in children and other target groups. 85Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Acta Paediatr. 2008 Jan;97(1):68-75.

Bandim Health Project, Indept h Science Centre, Apartado 861, Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. mariann.jakobsen@dadlnet.dk AIM: To evaluate the impact of promotion of exclusive breastfeeding on infant health in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, where mortality ra tes are high, breastfeeding is widely practiced but exclusive breastfeeding is rare. METHOD: At the Bandim Health Project in Guinea Bissau, West Africa, a birth cohort of 1721 infants were randomized to receive health education: promotion of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 4-6 months of life according to WHO recommendations at the time of the study. A ll children were followed from birth to 6 months of age. RESULTS: Introduction of both water and weaning food was significantly delayed in the intervention group. However we found no benefici al health effects of the intervention; there was no reduction in mortalit y in the intervention group compared with the control group (mortality rate ratio: 1.86 (0 .79-4.39)), weight at 4-6 months of age was significantly lower in the interv ention group (7.10 kg vs. 7.25 kg; Wilcoxon p=0.03). There was no difference in diarrho ea morbidity and hospitalization rates. CONCLUSION: Although mothers were sensitive to follow new breastfeeding recommendations, it had no beneficial impact on infant health in this society with traditional, intensive breastfeeding. There seems to be little reason to discour age local practices as long as there are no strong data justifying such a change. Br J Nutr. 2008 Mar;99(3):581-97. Epub 2007 Oct 10.

National Center for Women's and Children's Health, China CDC, Beijing 100013, China. jiangjingxiong@chinawch.org.cn BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity has become a h ealth problem in urban areas in China. Intervention to reduce childhood ob esity should be of high prior ity. School-based intervention programmes are needed to deal with the grow ing prevalence of childhood obesity in China. METHODS: Five primary schools were selected randomly for this study in the Beijing urban area in China; two were alloca ted to the interventi on group and three to the control group. A total of 2425 children (1029 ch ildren in intervention schools and 1396 children in control schools) took part in the study for 3 years. In the intervention group, children and their parents were involved in a programme of nut rition education and physical activity. Control school students followed their usual health and physical education curr iculum with no extra intervention. RESULTS: After the 3-year intervention, the prevalence of overweight and obesity were significantly lower in the interv ention schools than in the control schools (overweight: 14.4%, P < 0.01; obesity: 7.9% vs. 13.3%, P < 0.01). The prevalence of overweight and obesity decreased by 26.3% and 32.5% in inte rvention schools respectively after intervention. The prevalence of overweight a nd obesity increased in control schools. There was also signifi cant difference in body mass inde x between intervention and control schools (18.2 +/- 2.6 vs. 20.3 +/- 3.4, P < 0.01) after intervention. More non-obese children became obese in the control schools ( 7.0%) than in the intervention schools (2.4%) at end line (P < 0.01). Among the children who were obe se at baseline, 49.2% remained obese at end line in intervention schools while 61.9% rema ined obese in control schools (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that an inte rvention programme could be feasible in schools in Beijing, China. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was reduced in schoolchildren in Beijing through an intervention focused on nutrition education and physical activity. Overweight and obesity ch ildren as well as normal wei ght children and their parents should be involved in such an intervention programme. J Nutr. 2007 Sep;137(9):2147-53.

The objective of this study was to test the effect of a multiple-micronutrient-fortified beverage on 89Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations, micronutrient st atus, and growth among adolescent girls in rural Bangladesh. A total of 1125 girls (Hb > or = 70 g/ L) enrolled in a randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled trial and were alloca ted to either a fortified or nonfortified beverage of similar taste and appearance . The beverage was provided at schools 6 d/wk for 12 mo. Concentrations of Hb and serum ferritin (sFt), retinol, zi nc, and C-reactive protein were measured in venous blood samples at baseline, 6 mo, and 12 mo. In addi tion, weight, height, and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) measurements were taken. The fortified beverage increased the Hb and sFt and retinol concentrations at 6 mo (P < 0.01). Adolescent girls in the nonfortified beverage group were more li kely to suffer from anemia (Hb <120 5.47, resp ectively; P < 0.01). The fortified beverage group had greater increases in weight, MUAC, and BMI over 6 mo (P < 0.01). Consuming the beverage for an additional 6 mo did not further improve the Hb concentration, but the sFt level continued to increase (P = 0.01). The use of multiple-micronutrient-fortified beverage can contribute to the re duction of anemia and improvement of micronutrient status and growth in adolescent girls in rural Bangladesh Asia Pac J Clin Nutr. 2007;16(3):505-11. Multiple micronutrient fortification of salt and its effect on cognition in Chennai school children. Kumar MV 600018, India. vinodkumar_m_k@hotmail.com AIM: To test the efficacy of a multiple micronutrient fortified salt in improving the micronutrient status and health of school chil dren and its effect on cognition. METHODS: A salt fortified with multiple micronutrients was de veloped containing chelated ferrous sulphate, B12, folic acid, niacin, calcium pantothenate and iodine. The efficacy of the fortified salt was as sessed in 7-11 year old school children in Chennai, India. In the experimental group (N=63), th e food in the school kitchen was cooked with the fortified salt for a period of one year. The control group (N=66) consisted of day scholars who did not eat at the school. Hemoglobin, red blood cell count, hematocrit, serum vitamin A, urinary iodine and prevalence of angular stomatitis were measured at baseline and at the end of the st udy after one year. A batt ery of 7 memory tests (The personal information test, the Mann-Suiter Visual memory screen for objects, The digit span forward test, The digit span backward test, The delayed response test , The Benton Visual Retention Test and The Cattells retentivity test), one test for attenti on and concentration (Letter cancellation test) and one test for intelligence (Raven's coloured progr essive matrices) were administered to all the children at baseline and endline. RESULTS: There was a significant (p<0.05) improvement in the experimental group in hemoglobin, red ce ll count, urinary iodine and serum vitamin A whereas in the control group there was a stat istically significant decline (p<0.05) in hemoglobin, hematocrit, red cell count and urinary iodine. Angular stomatitis was eliminated from baseline 30.4% in the ex perimental group whereas it increased from 3.25% to 25.5% in the control group . In 4 tests out of the 7 me mory tests and in the letter cancellation test for attention, th e mean increment in scores in the experimental group is significantly more (p<0. 05) than the control group. There was no significant improvement in overall intelligence as seen in the Ravens progr essive matrices between the experimental and 90Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 control groups.

METHODS: Longitudinal, controlled interv ention study of 24 preschools whic h were compared before and after an intervention. The cont rol and intervention groups were defined by drawing lots to choose schools that had previously been paired for nutritional status. Th e intervention consisted of the addition of 10 g of multimixture to the meals provided to children attending the 12 schools in the intervention group. Outcome measures include changes in z scores for the three nutritional indices and hemoglobin values over the 6-month period during which the supplement was added. A multilevel model was used for analys es. RESULTS: Mean z scores for weight for age at the end of follow-up were 0.40 (+/-1.34 ) and 0.31 (+/-1.32), for the intervention and control groups respectively. The multilevel analys is demonstrated non-significant differences in favor of the intervention in mean z scores for weight for age (beta 0.05; 95%CI -0.03 to 0.12) and height for age (beta 0.02; 95%CI -0.06 to 0.0 9). Mean change in hemoglobin was against the intervention, but this was also without significance (bet a -0.01; 95%CI -0.36 to 0.34).

A comparative study of two mouthrinses on plaque and gingivitis in school children in the age group of 13-16 years in Bangalore city. Jayaprakash K , Veeresha KL , Hiremath SS . Department of Preventive and Community Dent istry, Rama Dental College and Hospital, 91Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Kanpur - 208 024, India. jpdentdoc@gmail.com Research and clinical ev idence indicate that most forms of plaque associated periodontal disease start as inflammatory lesions of the gingiva whic h if left untreated, may progress and eventually involve and compromise the entire periodontal at tachment apparatus of the affected teeth. A study was conducted to assess the e ffect of a mouthrinse contai ning chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride on plaque accumulation and gingivitis in comparison with a chlorhexidine mouthrinse alone in a group of school children aged 13-16 y ears in Bangalore city. This combination along with the well established effect of fluoride in the prevention of caries presents an important contribution to dental public health. The result s suggest that the chlorhexidine-sodium fluoride mouthrinse potentially possesses a significant e ffect on inhibition of plaque accumulation and gingivitis. This combination along with the well-est ablished effect of fluo ride in the prevention of caries, presents an important c ontribution to dental public health.

Risk factors for active trachoma and Chlamydia trachomatis infection in rural Ethiopia after mass treatment with azithromycin. Edwards T , J , Cumberland P. London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medi cine, London, UK. tansy.edwards@lshtm.ac.uk OBJECTIVES: To investigate risk factors for oc ular Chlamydia trachoma tis infection and active trachoma, comparing communities receiving or not receiving an intervention programme of community-wide azithromycin treatment and hea lth education. METHODS: In a 3-year post- intervention follow-up survey, 1722 children ag ed 3-9 years, from randomly selected households in 37 communities, were examined for signs of active trachoma and had samples taken to test for ocular C. tr achomatis by polymerase chain reacti on. Multivariate random effects logistic regression analyses cons idered interventions at commun ity level, adjusting for other independent risk factors as a ppropriate. RESULTS: Younger age, ocular discharge and flies on eyes were risk factors for active trachoma in communities with and without antibiotic treatment. After azithromycin treatment, odds of active trachoma were lower in children aged 6-9 years than in children aged 3-5 years (OR 0.48, 95% CI: 0.36-0.66) and higher with ocular discharge (OR 4.5, 95% CI: 2.6-7.7) or flies on their eyes (OR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.6-3.7). Odds of C. trachomatis infection were lower in children aged 6-9 years th an in younger children (OR 0.47, 95% CI: 0.23-0.96); and in children who r eceived 2 or 3 doses rather than 1 (OR 0.26, 95% CI: 0.08-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: In communities that received or did not receive the mass antibiotic treatment, the same risk factors for C. trachomatis and active trachoma were identified. Education and environmental improveme nts need to supplement antibiotic campaigns in order to positively impact on these remaining child level risk factors. 92Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Br J Ophthalmol. 2008 Jan;92(1):19-24. Two strategies for correcting refractive errors in school students in Tanzania: randomised comparison, with implic ations for screening Masanja H Bowman R , Todd J , Bowman R , Gilbert C . International Centre for Eye Health, London Sc hool of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK. susanne.wedner@gmx.net PURPOSE: To compare whether fr ee spectacles or only a prescription for spectacles influences wearing rates among Tanzanian students with un/undercorrected re fractive error (RE). METHODS: DESIGN: Cluster randomised trial. SETTING: 37 secondary schools in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. PARTICIPANTS: Distance vi sual acuity was measured in 6,904 year-1 students (90.2% response rate; median age 14 year s; range 11-25 years) using a Snellen E-chart. 135 had RE requiring correction. INTERVENTIONS: Schools were randomly allocated to free spectacles (arm A) or prescrip tion only (arm B). Primary outco me: Spectacle use at 3 months. RESULTS: The prevalence of un/undercorrected RE was 1.8% (95% CI: 1.5 to 2.2%). At 3 months, 27/58 (47%) students in arm A were wearing spectacles or had them at school compared with 13/50 (26%) in arm B (adjuste d OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.0 to 6.7). Free spectacles and myopia were independently associated with spectacle use. CONCLUSIONS: The low prevalence of un/undercorrected RE and poor uptak e of spectacles, even when provided free, raises doubts about the value of vision-screeni ng programmes in Tanzanian secondary schools. Policy decisions on school vision screening in middle- and low-income countries should take account of the cost-effectiveness as well as competing demands for scarce resources.

Epub 2007 Oct 22.*** Reduced in-hospital mortality after im proved management of children under 5 years admitted to hospital with malaria: randomised trial. tation of a standardised protocol for the management of malaria and provision of a fi nancial incentive for health workers reduced mortality. DESIGN: Randomised controlled interv ention trial. SETTING: P aediatric ward at the 93Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 national hospital in Guinea-Bissau. All children admitted to hospital with severe malaria received free drug kits. PARTICIPANTS: 951 child ren aged 3 months to 5 years admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of malaria randomised to normal or intervention wards. INTERVENTIONS: Before the start of the study, all personnel were trained in the use of the standardised guidelines for the management of malaria, including stri ct follow-up procedures. Nurses and doctors were randomised to work on in tervention or control wards. Personnel in the intervention ward received a sm all financial incentive ($50 ( 25 pounds sterling; 35 euros)/month for nurses and $160 for doctors) and their complia nce with standard case management was closely monitored. MAIN OUT COME MEASURES: In-hospital mortality and cumulative mortality within 4 weeks of hospital admission. RESULTS: In-hospital mort ality was 5% for the intervention group and 10% in the control group (risk ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.29 to 0.79). The effect may have been stronger in pa tients with positive malaria slides (0.36, 0.16 to 0.80). Cumulative mortality 4 weeks after discha rge was also lower in the intervention group (0.61, 0.40 to 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Supervisi ng healthcare workers to adhere to a standardised treatment protocol was associated with greatly reduced in-hospital mortality. Financial incentives may be important for the dedication and compliance of staff members. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Tr ials NCT00465777 [ClinicalTrials.gov] Comment This is an important study, as it showed a reducti on in mortality rate from malaria in paediatric wards where there was training, availabili ty of free drugs an d treatment kits, and \"modest\" financial incentives to staff. On the one hand, this study calls for much better remuneration and support for health workers. On the other hand, the way the study was conducted raised some important issues of inequa lity. Important comments on this study were made in: BMJ. 2007 Nov 10;335(7627):954. \"There was no mention of how the unequal hospital environment created by the study may itself have contributed to the results. It would have been useful to hear from the nurses and doctors themselves. How did it feel to be in the control group, to receive no extra money, and to have to continue moonlighting to pay for food and rent, while colleagues (working in a similar children's ward in the same building) enjoyed a monthly bonus ($50 and $160 a month for nurses and doctors respectively)?\" School health (see also Nutrition) Alcohol. 2007 Sep;41(6):403-14. Language and literacy outcomes from a pilot intervention study for children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in South Africa. Adnams CM , J , May PA . Department of Paediatrics, School of Child a nd Adolescent Health, University of Cape Town, South Africa. This pilot study investigated the efficacy of a classroom language and literacy intervention in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The study forms part of a larger, ongoing study that includes metacognitive and family support interventions in additi on to language and literacy training (LLT). For the LLT study, 65 94Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 nine-year-old children identified as either FASD or not prenat ally exposed to alcohol, were recruited. Forty children with FASD were randomly assigned to either a LLT intervention group or FASD control group (FASD-C). Twenty-five nonalcohol-exposed children were randomly selected as nonexposed controls (NONEXP-C). Pr ior to intervention and after nine school-term months of treatment, general scholastic tests, teacher and parent quest ionnaires, classroom observations and specific language and literacy tests were administ ered to the participants. The nine months assessment reflects the midpoint and the first assessment stage of the overall study. At initial diagnosis and prior to commencement of the interventions, pa rticipants with FASD were significantly weaker than NONEXP-C childr en in reading, spelling, addition, subtraction, phonological awareness, and other tests of early l iteracy. Teachers rated a range of adaptive behaviors of children with FASD as significan tly worse than NONEXP-C. Mean scholastic and language and literacy scores for all groups show ed improvement over baseline scores after 9 months of intervention. The mean test scores of children with FA SD remained lower than those of NONEXP-C. Comparison of mean baseline to postintervention score changes between the LLT, FASD-C, and NONEXP-C groups revealed th at although there were no significant gains by the LLT intervention group over control groups on the general scholastic assessment battery, significantly greater improvements occurred in the LLT intervention group compared to the FASD-C group in specific categories of language and early literacy. These categories were syllable manipulation, letter sound knowledge, written letters, word reading and nonword reading, and spelling. In spite of cognitive and cl assroom behavioral difficulties, children with FASD from a vulnerable environment demons trated significant cognitive improvements in specific areas targeted by classroom interventions . To our knowledge, this is the first report of a systematic classroom intervention and resultan t cognitive response in children with FASD. J Trauma Stress. 2007 Aug;20(4):541-51.

Israel Trauma Center for the Victims of Terror and War (NATAL), Tel Aviv, Israel. A school-based intervention for preventing and reducing children's posttr aumatic stress-related symptoms, somatic complaints, functional impairme nt, and anxiety due to exposure to terrorism was evaluated. In a quasi-randomized controlle d trial, elementary school students were randomly assigned to an eight-session struct ured program, \"Overshadowing the Threat of Terrorism\" or to a waiting list control co mparison group. Two months postintervention, the study group reported significant improvement on a ll measures. The authors conclude that a school-based universal intervention may signi ficantly reduce posttraumatic stress disorder- (PTSD-) related symptoms in children repeatedly exposed to terrorist atta cks and propose that it serve as a component of a public mental health approach dealing with children exposed to ongoing terrorism in a country ravaged by war and terrorism.

Escola Superior em Ci\u00eancias of Health Science) Bras\u00edlia, DF Brazil. elzadesouza@terra.com.br Recent years have seen a burgeoning of interg enerational programmes aiming to improve the well being of participants. However, very few pr ogrammes have been formally evaluated. In this paper we report results from a randomised contro lled trial of a school-based intergenerational intervention undertaken in Brazil. Randomly selected samples of 253 adolescents and 266 elders aged 60 and over resident in the sch ool's catchment area were administered a questionnaire including questions on cognitiv e components of social capital, family relationships, and self-rated health. Participants were then randomly allocated to control and intervention groups. The intervention comprised particip ation in a 4 month programme of intergenerational activities in which the elders shared their memories with the students. At the end of the intervention the questionnaire was re-administered to the samples. High proportions (85-95%) of both samp les completed the questionnaires but compliance with the intervention was low in the elde rly group. In the analysis of results from the elderly sample, we therefore compared the control group with the group assigned to the intervention (intention to treat an alysis). Results showed that adolescents in the intervention group were nearly three times more likely to rate their health as good than those in the control group, but also more likely to judge th at most people were selfish. In the elderly sample, those from the intervention group we re over twice as likely as those from the control group to report positively on the help fulness of neighbours; judge most people to be honest or consider their family relationships as good. There were no significant differences between groups on other outcome measures. These re sults suggest that structured intergenerational activities may have positive effects on some aspects of social capital for both adolescents and elderly people , although further research is needed to elucidate the processes involved and the extent to which the fi ndings are context specifi c. This study is the first to use a controlled trial de sign to evaluate this type of intervention and is valuable in showing that this design can be used in interv entions of this kind, a nd also the difficulties involved.

Oral amoxicillin vs. pyoderma in Bamako, Mali: trials child health in developing countries 2007-08 Center National d'Appui \u00e0 la lutte BP 251, Bamako, Mali. BACKGROUND: Pyoderma (bacterial superficial skin infection) is an extremely common disorder in tropical developi ng countries. In these setti ngs, Streptococcus pyogenes is considered to be the main etiological agent. Apart from epidemics of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis where mass treatment with intramuscular benzathine-penicillin is recommended, no recommendation exists for the tr eatment of pyoderma in this setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of oral amoxicillin in the treatment of pyoderma in Mali, by comparison with oral erythromycin. METHODS: In Bamako, 132 patients with pyoderma, diagnosed and graded as \"severe\" on clinical grounds, were randomly assigned to an oral treatment by either amoxici llin (50 mg/kg per day) or erythromycin ; infections of the follicular appendage were excluded. Both drugs were associated with the topical application of povidone iodine. The patients were evaluated ope nly at the seventh day of treatment for cure or marked improvement of the clinical features, indicating successful treatment. RESULTS: Three patie nts were lost to follow-up. Treatment was successful in 57 of 64 patients treated with amoxicillin vs. 58 of 65 patients treated with erythromycin (P = 0.00). CONCLUSIONS: Amoxicillin was as efficacious as erythromycin in the treatment of severe pyoderma in Mali. Owing to its efficacy, added to high availability and low cost, this compound should be considered a fi rst-line treatment of this di sorder in this country, and perhaps in other countries where this condition presents in a similar way. Comment The p-value quoted (p=0.00) may be incorrect, as there was no diff erence between the two groups. This does not indicate equivalence, ju st no difference found in the relatively small sample.

Department of Medicine and Diagnostics, Swiss Tropical Institute, Basel, Switzerland. BACKGROUND: Superficial dermatomycoses are a common problem in tropical regions. Due to limited resources, specific an timycotic therapy is often not available. The present study was performed to assess the clinical efficacy of the antimicrobial agent Triclosan in bar soap in comparison with regular soap against selected superficial dermatomycoses in Tanzanian schoolchildren. METHODS: 820 primary school childre n were examined for skin disorders and 224 of these were included in the soap trial. The clinical presentation of dermatomycoses was recorded using a symptom score. Samples we re taken for microscopic examination and mycological culture. The study participants received e ither bar soap containing Triclosan or a placebo for 2 months. They were re-examined at the end of this period. RESULTS: The benefit achieved by the addition of Triclo san was not statistically significant. Overall cure rates for Triclosan and placebo groups take n together were 21.8% for was confirmed microscopically. 97Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 For the majority of the children the dermat omycoses improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The results strongly argue for regular soap use against common dermatomycoses as a low-cost and effective treatment. This promising findi ng should be considered in settings where dermatophyte infections represen t a public health problem and where access to appropriate treatment and financial resources are limited.

Dave N nandini_dave@rediffmail.com BACKGROUND: There are few studie s on stress responses to laparoscopic surgery in children. This study was conducted to assess the blood glucos e levels in children undergoing laparoscopy. We also studied the effect of two different in travenous (i.v.) solutions on blood glucose in open and laparoscopic procedures. METHODS: One hundred and twenty healthy children, aged 2-12 years, undergoing either open or laparo scopic surgery, were ra ndomized to receive saline (DS) or Ringer's lactate peri-operatively (RL). All had blood glucose measurements performed imme diately after induction but prior to the i.v. infusion of any fluid. Blood glucose was again measured 1 h after induction in the open cases and 1 h after insufflation in the laparoscopy cases. RESULTS: In the groups, baseline blood glucose values were comparable. In all groups, blood glucose conc entrations increased from the immediate post-induction (baseline) values. When RL was infused, the 1-h blood glucose was higher in the laparoscopy group as compared with the open group. However, when DS was infused the difference between the 1- h blood glucose in the open and laparoscopic procedures was not statistica lly significant. In the laparo scopy group, the 1-h blood glucose value was significantly higher in the patients receiving dextrose solution. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic procedures in children are associ ated with a rise in blood glucose levels similar to open surgery. The hyperglycaem ic response was more pronounced when dextrose-containing solutions were infused peri-operatively. Int J Surg. 2007 Aug;5(4):234-8.

In this modern era of minimally invasive surgery, there is a lot of emphasis on cosmesis and early recovery. We performed a prospective, double blind, randomis ed trial to evaluate a new incision for appendectomy to compare with conventiona l appendectomy. METHODS: One hundred and twenty patients, aged between 3 and 18 years, were randomized to receive either small access appendectomy (SAA) (n=60, 53 acute appendic itis and 7 interval appendectomy) or conventional appendectomy (CAP) (n=60, 55 acute appendicitis and 5 interval appendectomy). SAA was performed through an incision in the lateral 1/3 of the spino-umbilical line, lateral to McBurney's point. The caecum along with the ap pendix could be delivered through this small incision easily as the ileal loops did not interfere with the delive ry. All patients suspected of acute appendicitis were evaluated by the modi fied Alvarado's system to reduce the rate of negative appendectomies. Patients with diffuse peritonitis were excluded. RESULTS: The demographic data for the two groups were simi lar. The SAA group required less analgesics (p<0.001), had earlier ambulation and shorter hosp ital stay (p<0.001), and better cosmetic score (p<0.001), but the operation took longer (p<0.001) compared to the CAP group. CONCLUSION: We conclude that SAA can be done safely without the need for any special equipment, with definite advant ages over conventional appendectomy.

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, single-blind, study to compare two methods of performing adenoidectomy. A gr oup of 100 children, undergoing adenoidectomy alone or in combination with tonsillectomy, were randomized into two groups and underwent either suction diathermy or curettage adenoidectomy by a single surgeon. SETTING: A tertiary care Paediatric Hospital. METHOD: Indication for surgery, adenoidal size, duration of surgery and complications were recorded and compared. Six-month follow-up was conducted and adenoidal size and symptom status were recorded and comp ared. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: One hundred patients participated in this study and underwent adenoidectomy alone or adenot onsillectomy. Ninety-two patients returned for follow-up and 91 patients completed the study. The two treatment groups were well matched for age and gender. The main indications for both groups were snoring, nasal obstruction and obstructive sleep apnoea. For adenoidectomy alone there was no significant difference in duration of surgery between the curette and suction diatherm y groups. When performing tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy together suction diathermy took significantly longer to complete than curettage (P<0.001). Overall 96% of patients' symptoms had either improved or resolved. The post- operative comparison at 6 months showed a signi ficant difference in the residual adenoidal size between the two groups, the sucti on diathermy group being generally smaller than the curettage 99Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 group. CONCLUSIONS: Suction diathermy was bette r at reducing the adenoidal size 6 months after surgery. Although the difference in size was st atistically significant it di d not seem to be of clinical significance. Supportive care J Infus Nurs. 2008 May-Jun;31(3):182-8.

Though in use for some decades now, there is no consensus on f actors affecting the duration of patency and complications. The present study is a randomized controlled trial covering all aspects associated with vascular access. This prospective interv entional study was conducted over a period of 6 months in a general pediatric ward of Lady Ha rdinge Medical College and Associated Kalawati Saran Children's Hospital. This sample was comp osed of 88 patients, fr om neonates to 12-year- olds who were admitted to the pediatric ward, on whom a total of 377 catheters were started. Intravenous cannulations were randomized for heparin flushes (1:100 dilution) and splints. Prospective data were collected regarding duration of patency and complications. Both univariate and multivariate analys is were done. There was a statis tically significant increase in the duration of patency with the use of heparin flushes and splin ts. The incidence of phlebitis increased with heparin flushes. Shorter patency duration and increased complications were associated with younger age, wrist and scal p insertions, and 24-gauge catheters.

The Department of Family and Child Nursing, School of Nursing, University of Washington, WA 98195, USA. hsim@u.washington.edu The purpose of this study was to test the effect of Yakson (i.e. a traditional Korean touching method) and non-nutritive sucking (NNS) on reduci ng the pain that neonates experience when undergoing the heel stick procedure for blood testing. Ninety-nine healthy neonates were recruited and assigned into thr ee groups: Yakson (n = 33), NNS (n = 33), and control group (n = 33). Each intervention was provided to the Yaks on and NNS groups from 1 min before heel stick until the completion of the heel stick. For the Yakson group, a researcher caressed the belly 101Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 of a neonate with one hand while supporting the back with th e other hand. For the NNS group, a pacifier packed with sterile gauze was put in the neonate's mouth. The oxygen saturation levels in the Yakson and NNS group neonates were mainta ined significantly bette r than in the control group neonates. There was no significant difference be tween the groups with regard to heart rate and neonatal infant pain, measured using the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale. Findings indicate that Yakson can be used during heel stick to help ne onates maintain their oxygen saturation level following the procedure. Tuberculosis Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2008 Mar;65(3):423-7.

Department of Pharmacology, All India Institut e of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. drgupta.pooja@gmail.com WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJ ECT: Pyrazinamide is recommended in doses varying from 15 to 40 mg kg(-1). The most commonly used average daily dose is 25 mg kg(-1). Its use is associated with dose depende nt hepatotoxicity. Lower doses are not used because of lack of pharmacokinetic data especia lly in children. There is only one detailed study of pyrazinamide in children at a dose of 35 mg kg(-1). WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This is the first study evaluating serum concentrations of pyr azinamide in children at a dose of 15 mg kg(- 1) which is on the lower side of the recomm ended dose. The study also compared the serum concentrations and pharmacokinetics achieved with this dose with the widely used dose of 25 mg kg(-1) in children suffering from tuberculosis. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic indices of pyrazinamide were comparable with the 25 and 15 mg kg(-1) doses. AIMS: To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynami c indices of pyrazinamide at doses of 15 and 25 mg kg(-1) in children sufferi ng from tuberculosis. METHODS: Twenty children with tuberculosis received pyrazinamide at a single dose of 25 mg kg(-1) (group I) and 15 mg kg(-1) (group II). Serial blood samples were collected and the drug concentrations were analyzed spectrophotometricall y. The pharmacokinetic paramete rs were calculated and the duration of time for which pyrazinamide con centrations in serum remained ml(-1) (95% CI +/- 7.7) in groups I and II, respectively. The elimination half-life was 9.3 +/- 1.3 h and 10.5 +/- 2.3 h (P = 0.6) and clearance was 0.06 +/- 0.01 l h(-1) kg(-1) and 0.04 +/- 0.01 l h(-1) kg(-1) (P = 0.08) in groups I and II, respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters and PKPD indices were comparable with both the doses. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that compar able serum concentrations of pyrazinamide are attained with 25 mg kg(-1 ) and 15 mg kg(-1) doses in children. The 102Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 elimination half-life was longer and volume of distribution grea ter in children than in the adult population.

PARTICIPANTS: The participants were 101 healthy ad ults (males and non-pregnant females) aged 18-40 years and 100 healthy children (males and non-pregnant females) aged 1-17 years. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive either th e bivalent killed whole cell oral cholera vaccine or placebo (killed oral Escherichia coli K 12). OUTCOME MEASURES: For safety: proportion of subjects with adverse events during the durat ion of study participatio n. For immunogenicity: Proportion of subjects who had a > or = 4-fold ri se in serum vibriocida l antibody titers 14 days after the second dose of vaccine or placebo. RE SULTS: Adverse reactions were observed with similar frequency among vaccine and placebo reci pients in both age groups. Among adults 4% of vaccine and 8% of placebo recipients and am ong children 4% of vaccine and 2% of placebo recipients had at least one adverse event with in 28 days of the first dose of the vaccine. Following immunization, 53% of adult and 80% of children vaccinees showed a > or = 4 fold rise in serum V. cholerae O1 vibriocidal antibody titers. A cholerae O139 vibriocidal antibody titers pos t-immunization was noted among vaccinees. CONCLUSIONS: We found the vaccine to be safe and immunogenic in a cholera-endemic area in India.

PLoS ONE. 2008 May 14;3(5):e2159. 103Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 A phase II, randomized study on an investigational DTPw-HBV/Hib-MenAC conjugate vaccine administered to infants in Northern Ghana. Hodgson A , Forgor AA , Navrongo, Ghana. BACKGROUND: Combining meningococcal vaccina tion with routine immunization in infancy may reduce the burden of meningococcal meningitis, especially in the meni ngitis belt of Africa. We have evaluated the immunogenicity, persisten ce of immune response, immune memory and safety of an investigational DTPw-HBV/Hib-M enAC conjugate vaccine given to infants in Northern Ghana. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this phase II, doubl e blind, randomized, controlled study, 280 infants were primed with DTPw-HBV/Hib-MenAC or DTPw-HBV/Hib vaccines at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age. At 12 months of age, children in each group received a challenge dose of serogroup A+C polysaccharides. Antibody responses were assessed pre, and one month-post dose 3 of the priming schedule an d pre and 1 month after administration of the challenge dose. One month post-dose 3, 87.8% and 88.2% of subjects in the study group had bactericidal meningococcal A titres > or = 1: 8 respectively. Seroprotection/se ropositivity ra tes to the 5 antigens administered in the routine EPI schedule were non-inferior in children in the study group compared to those in the control group. Th e percentages of subjects in the study group with persisting SBA-MenA titres > or = 1:8 or SBA-MenC titres > or = 1:8 at the age of 12 months prior to challenge were significantly higher than in control group (47.7% vs 25.7% and 56.4% vs 5.1% respectively). SBA-MenA GMT by 14.0-fold in the DTPW-HBV/HibMenAC-group compared to a 3.8 fold increase in the control-group. Co rresponding fold-increases in SBA-MenC titres following challenge with 10 microg of group C polysaccharide were 18.8 and 1.9 respectively. Reactogenicity following primary vaccination or the administration of the challenge dose was similar in both groups, except for swelling (Grade 3) after primary vaccination which was more frequent in children in the vaccine than in the control group (23.7%; 95% CI [19.6-28.1] of doses doses). Fifty-nine SAEs (incl uding 8 deaths), none of them related to vaccination, were reported duri ng the entire study. CONCLUSIONS: Three dose primary vaccination with DTPw-HBV/Hib-MenAC was non-inferior to DTPw-HBV/Hib for the 5 common antigens used in the r outine EPI schedule and induced bactericidal antibodies against Neisseria meningitidis of serogroups A and C in the majority of infants. Serogroup A and C bactericidal antibody levels had fall en below titres associated with protection in nearly half of the infants by the age of 12 months confirming th at a booster dose is require d at about that age. An enhanced memory response was shown after polysaccharide challenge. This vaccine could provide protection against 7 important childhood diseases (including meningococcal A and C) and be of particular value in countries of the African meningitis belt.

Evaluation of two yellow fever vaccines for routine immunization programs in Argentina. Ripoll C , Ponce A , Wilson MM DE in child health in 2007-08 Jefe del Area Epidemiolog\u00eda, Ministerio de Salud, Jujuy, Argentina. Although highly effective vaccines have been available for almost 70 years, an estimated 200,000 cases of YF, including 30,000 deaths, still occur annually. This study evaluated the safety of two yellow fever (YF) vaccines [Stamaril and Vacina Contra Febre randomized equa lly to receive Stamaril or VCFA. Immediate reactions occurring within 30 mi nutes after vaccination, and solicited local and systemic reactions occurring within eight days, were monitored. Unso licited local, systemic adverse events and serious adverse events (SAE) were re corded for 21 days after vaccination. Solicited local and systemic adverse reactions we re reported by 15.3-17.6% and 30.4-31.6% of the Stamaril and VCFA groups, respectively. Only 56 of the 2,514 study subjects (2.2%) reported a severe solicited adverse reaction, 25 in the Stamaril group (1.99%) and 31 in the VFCA group (2.49%), (p=0.403). Ten subjects (0.8%) in each group reported at least one severe solicited local reaction (p = 0.988). A to tal of 18 Stamaril subjects ( 1.43%) and 21 VCFA subjects (1.68%) reported at least one severe solicited sy stemic reaction (p = 0.617) One SAE considered related to vaccination occurred, polymyalgia in the VCFA group. No immediate reactions to vaccination were seen. Vaccine-rel ated unsolicited events were infrequent, 1.4% in the Stamaril group and 2.0% VCFA group, generally of mild or moderate intensity. We conclude that the safety profiles of Stamaril and VCFA support rou tine vaccination to preven t YF in residents of and travelers to endemic areas of South America and Africa.

Wang L , Li J, Chen H , Li F, Armstrong GL , Nelson C , Ze W , Shapiro CN . Program for Appropriate Technology in Health, Beijing, China. lixiawangcn@gmail.com OBJECTIVE: To prevent perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV), WHO recommends that the first dose of hepatitis B (HepB) vaccine be given within 24 hours after birth. This presents a challenge in remote areas with lim ited cold-chain infrastructure and where many children are born at home. METHODS: Rural to wnships in three counties in China's Hunan Province were randomized into three groups with different strategies for delivery of the first dose of HepB vaccine. In group 1, vaccine was stored within the cold chain and administered in township hospitals. In group 2, vaccine was stor ed out of the cold chain in villages and administered by village-based health workers to infants at home. Group 3 used the same strategy as group 2, but vaccine was packaged in a prefilled injection device. Tr aining of immunization providers and public communication conveying the importance of the birth dose was performed for all groups. FINDINGS: Among children born at home, timely administration (within 24 hours after birth) of the first dose of HepB v accine increased in all groups after the study: group 1, from 2.4% to 25.2%; group 2, from 2.6% to 51.8%; and group 3, from 0.6% to 66.7%; P < 0.001 in each case. No significant difference in antibody response to vaccine was observed between the groups. CONCLUSION: Timely administration of the first dose of HepB vaccine 105Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 was improved by communication and training activ ities, and by out-of-co ld-chain storage of vaccine and administration at the village le vel, especially among children born at home. Comment This study adds to previous evidence that hepatitis B vaccine is effective even if the cold chain is not maintained. It has relevance to locations in which hepatitis B vaccine can be given, and how countries with high rates of deliveries outside he alth facilities can improve the proportion of babies receiving hepatitis B va ccine in the first 24 hours of life. This study showed that administration at a village level in rural China was effective. Int J Infect Dis. 2008 May;12(3):270-7. Epub 2007 Nov 7. Immunogenicity, safety, and interchangeab ility of two inactivated hepatitis A vaccines in Chilean Abarca K , I To compare the immunogenicity, safe ty, and interchangeabil ity of two pediatric hepatitis A vaccines, Avaxim 80U-Pediatric and Havrix 720, in Chilean children. METHODS: In this randomized trial, 332 he patitis A virus (HAV) seronegative children from 1 to 15 years of age received two doses of Avaxim, two doses of Havrix, or Havrix followed by Avaxim, 6 months apart. Anti-HAV antibody titers were measured before and 14 days after the first dose of vaccine, and before and 28 days after the second dose of vaccine. Immediate reactions were monitored; reactogenicity was evaluated from pa rental reports. RESULT S: Seroconversion rates after the first vaccin ation 100% for Avaxim and Havrix, respectively. Anti- HAV geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) we re 138 mIU/ml for Havrix (95% confidence of Havrix, mIU/ml following two doses of Avaxim, and 7144 mIU/ml in children who received Havrix with Avaxim as the second dose. Following the first injection, 36% of subjects given Avaxim and 44% given Havrix reported local reactions; 38% of subjects in the Avaxim group and 40% in the Havrix group reported systemic reactions related to vaccination. So licited reactions were less frequent after the second dose of Avaxim or Havrix, occurring in 27% to 37% of subjects . CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference in seroconversion rates was seen 14 days after a single dose of vaccine. A two-dose schedule with either vaccine or with Havrix/Avaxim provided a strong booster response. Both vaccines were well tolerated and can be recommended for rou tine vaccination of Chilean children. Avaxim 80 may be used to complete a vaccine schedule begun with Havrix 720. Ann Acad Med Singapore. 2007 Oct;36(10):801-6. 106Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Primary vaccination of infants against hepatitis B can be completed using a combined hexavalent diphtheria-teta nus-acellular pertussis-hepatitis B- inactivated Choa Chu Kang, Singapore. Fong_Seng_LIM@nhgp.com.sg INTRODUCTION: Children in Singapore receive vaccination against hepatitis B virus (HBV) at 0, 1 and 5 or 6 months of age, and vaccination against pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, and polio at 3, 4 and 5 months of age. Parents often c hoose to vaccinate with the combined acellular- pertussis-inactivated polio-Hib vaccine V/Hib). We investigated whether a combined hexavalent vaccine, DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib, could re place the separate administration of DTPa- IPV/Hib and HBV for the final vaccination at 5 months of age (Trial DTPa-HBV-IPV-075). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In an open study, 150 children were randomised to complete their vaccination schedule with DTPa-IP V/Hib + HBV or DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib. RESULTS: One month after the final vaccin ation, there was no difference be tween groups in seroprotection rates or antibody concentrations ag ainst HBV. Seroprotection rate s against diphtheria, tetanus, Hib and polio, as well as vaccine response rates to pertussis antigens were also similar between groups. Local and general symptoms occurred at a similar rate after th e third dose of either vaccine. CONCLUSION: The immunogenicity and r eactogenicity of the hexavalent vaccine DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib (Infanrix hexa, GSK) group is comparable to that of separately administered DTPa-IPV/Hib and HBV vaccines. Combined hexavalent vaccine, DTPa-HBV- IPV/Hib, the separate administra tion of DTPa-IPV/Hib and HBV for vaccination at 5 months of age, thereby reduci ng the number of injections required.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and imm unogenicity of revaccination with locally- produced Vi polysaccharide vaccine 3 years after the first dose in Chinese children aged 9 to 14 years. METHODS: A randomized, placebo-contro lled trial was conducted in Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. Six hundred and sixty-seven eligible children who had previously received a primary dose of Vi vaccine were randomly assigned to receive 1 dose of 30 mug Vi vaccine or placebo. In addition, 331 eligible children received 1 dos e of Vi polysaccharide vaccine as a primary vaccination. Adverse events were followed for 28 days after vaccination. Serum samples were collected from a subgroup of participants on day 0 and day 28, and Vi antibodies were analyzed using a passive hemagglutination method. RESULTS: Revaccination was found to be safe and immunogenic. No severe adverse events were observed. A significant in crease in antibody titers after vaccination was observ ed among children who had and had not been previously vaccinated. Twenty-eight days after injection, the seropositive rate was 79% in both 107Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 revaccination and primary injec tion groups; the geometric mean antibody titer was 1:40 in the primary injection group and 1:29 in the revaccination group (P = 0.24). Although the difference of attained geometric mean titers in follow-up sera was not significantly different in these 2 groups, the fold-rise of these titers from base line was significantly higher in the primary injection group than in the revaccination group (7.7 versus 3.1, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We found that revaccination using th e locally produced Vi polysaccharide vaccine among Chinese school-aged children was safe and increased antibody titers. Revaccination can be used to extend the duration of protection provided by Vi polysaccharide vaccine. Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2007 Sep;26(9):787-93. Concomitant administration of a virosom e-adjuvanted hepatitis a vaccine with routine childhood vaccines at age twe lve to fifteen months: a randomized controlled trial. Dagan R , , Herzog C . Soroka University Medical Center and the Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel. rdagan@bgu.ac.il BACKGROUND: The objectives of this trial were to test for noninferiority of a virosomal hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine (Epaxal) coadministered w ith routine childhood vaccines compared with Epaxal given alone and to an alum-adjuvanted HAV vaccine (Havrix Junior) coadministered with routine childhood vacci nes. METHODS: Healthy children 12- to 15- month-old were randomized to receive eith er a pediatric dose (0.25 mL) of Epaxal coadministered with DTPaHibIPV, oral polio va ccine, and measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (n = 109; group A), or Epaxal given al one (n = 105; group B), or Havrix Junior coadministered with DTPaHibIPV, oral polio vaccine, and measles- mumps-rubella vaccine (n = 108; group C). A booster dose was given 6 months later. Anti-HAV antibodies were tested before and 1 month after each vaccination. Safety was assessed for 1 month after each vaccination. Solicited adverse events were assessed for 4 days after each v accination. RESULTS:: HAV se roprotection rates (> or =20 mIU/mL) at 1 and 6 months after C: P < 0.001 and P = 0.017 at month 1 and 6, respectively). The respective geometric mean c oncentrations were: A: 51 and 64 mIU/mL, B: 49 and C: 33 and 37 mIU/mL (A ve rsus C: P < 0.001 at both time points). All groups achieved 100% seroprotection after the booster dose. The geometric mean concentrations after the booster dose were 1758, 1662, and 1414, for groups A, B and C, respectively (A versus C: P = 0.15). No clinically signi ficant reduction in immune respons e to all concomitant vaccine antigens was seen. All vaccines were well to lerated. CONCLUSIONS:: Coadministration of pediatric Epaxal with routine childhood vaccine s showed immunogenicity and safety equal to Epaxal alone as well as to Havrix Junior. Af ter first dose, Epaxal was significantly more immunogenic than Havrix Junior.

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of intradermal rabies pre- exposure prophylaxis with purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV) in schoolchildren age 5 to 8 years in Thailand. STUDY DESIGN: In a rando mized, open-label, phase II clinical trial, 2 or 3 intradermal doses of 0.1 mL PCECV (Rabipur) were administered to 703 schoolchildren on days 0 and 28 or on days 0, 7, and 28. In 206 children, 2 simulated post-exposure booster doses were given 1 year after the primary vaccinati on series. Rabies virus- neutralizing antibody (RVNA) titers were by rescent focus inhibition test. RESULTS: In school-age children in Thailand, a pre-exposure imm unization regimen of 3 intradermal doses of PCECV produced adequate immune responses . After primary vaccination, all subjects developed RVNA titers > or =0.5 IU/mL and demons trated a increa se in RVNA titer after 2 simulated post-exposure booster immunizations 1 year after the primary vaccination series. No serious adverse drug reactions occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Rabies pre-exposure immunization with PCECV is safe and immunogenic, and its implementation could save the lives of many children in rabies-endemic areas.

MR CAIV-T Pediatric Efficacy Trial Network . Department of Microbiology and Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong. tamj1@wyeth.com BACKGROUND: This study was desi gned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cold-adapted influenza vaccine, trivalent (CAIV-T) against cu lture-confirmed influenza in children 12 to <36 months of age during 2 consecutive influenza se asons at multiple sites in Asia. METHODS: In year 1, 3174 children 12 to <36 months of age we re randomized to receive 2 doses of CAIV-T (n = 1900) or placebo (n = 1274) intranasally > or =28 days apart. In year 2, 2947 subjects were rerandomized to receive 1 dose of CAIV-T or placebo. RESULTS: Mean age at enrollment was 23.5 +/- 7.4 months. In year 1, efficacy of CA IV-T compared with placebo was 72.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 60.9-77.3%) strai n. In year 2, revaccination with CAIV-T demonstrated significant efficacy against an st rains. In year 1, fever, runny nose/nasal congestion, decreased activity a nd appetite, and use of fever medication were more frequent with CAIV-T after dose 1. Runny nos e/nasal congestion after dose 2 (year 1) and dose 3 (year 2) and use of fever medication after dose 3 (yea r 2) were the only other events reported significantly more frequently in CAIV-T recipients. CONCLUSIONS: CAIV-T was well tolerated and effective in preventing culture-confirmed influenza illness over multiple and complex influenza seasons in young children in Asia.

Benn CS P . trials in 2007-08 Project, Statens S, Denmark. cb@ssi.dk OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of high dose vitamin A supplementation given with BCG vaccine at birth in an African setting with high infant mort ality. DESIGN: Randomised placebo controlled trial. Setting Bandim Health Project's demographic surveillance system in Guinea- Bissau, covering approximately 90,000 inhabitants. Participants 4345 infants due to receive BCG. INTERVENTION: Infants were randomised to 50,000 IU vitamin A or placebo and followed until age 12 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Mortality rate ratios. RESULTS: 174 children died during follo w-up (mortality=47/1000 person-years). Vitamin A supplementation was not significantly associated with mortality; the mortality rate ratio was 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.79 to 1.44) . The effect was 1.00 (0.65 to 1.56) during the first four months and 1.13 (0.75 to 1.68) from 4 to 12 months of age. The mortality rate ratio in boys was 0.84 (0.55 to 1.27) compared with 1.39 (0.90 to 2.14) in girls (P for interaction=0.10). An explorative analysis revealed a strong inte raction between vitamin A and season of administration. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin A supplementation given with BCG vaccine at birth had no signif icant benefit in this African setting. Although little doubt exists that vitamin A supplementation redu ces mortality in older children, a global recommendation of supplementation for all ne wborn infants may not contribute to better survival.

Fisker AB BACKGROUND: The effect of vitamin A supplementation (VAS) at birth on subsequent vitamin A status has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to study the effect of 50,000 IU vitamin A administered with BCG vaccine at birth on vitamin A status in both sexes. DESIGN: Within a randomized placebo-contro lled trial of VAS, we obtained blood from 614 children at 6 wk of age and from 369 mother -infant pairs at 4 mo of age. We assessed vitamin A status on the basis of serum retinol -binding protein (RBP) and measured serum C- reactive protein to monitor for concurrent infections. RESULTS: RBP concentrations indicated vitamin A deficiency in 32% of the children at age 6 wk and in 16% at age 4 mo. VAS was not associated with higher RBP concentrations overa ll or in either sex. However, the effect of VAS varied with maternal education (P for intera ction = 0.004): At age 6 wk, VAS was associated with higher (9%; 95% CI : 2, 17%) RBP concentrations in ch ildren of noneducated mothers but not in children of educated mothers. Overall, RBP concentrations increased between 6 wk and 4 mo of age. The increase correlated inversely wi th the number of diphthe ria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccines received in the in terval (P = 0.009), particularly in girls (P for interaction = 0.01) and in vitamin A recipien ts (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, VAS at birth had no effect on vitamin A status. However VAS may temporarily improve vitamin A status in the 111Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 subgroup of children of noneducated mothers . In vitamin A recipients, subsequent DTP vaccines affected vitami n A status negatively. The main trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00168597 Comment There is limited evidence for any benefit of Vita min A given to neonates. There is more evidence to support maternal supplementation in the pos t-partum period and encouragement of exclusive breast feeding to increase vitamin A levels in the first 6 months of li fe. In communicating the results of this study above it will very important to emphasize the va lue of vitamin A at 6 months of age. Most country programs do not currently give vitamin A for neonates anyway, but give routine supplementation at 6 and 12 months (and some every 6 months up to 5 years). There is very strong evidence of a protecti ve effect against mortality and morbidity when vitamin A is given at 6 and 12 months, and this message should not be lost in discussions of the value of a birth dose of vitamin A.

Department of International Health, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. jtielsch@jhsph.edu Maternal night blindness is common during pr egnancy in many developing countries. Previous studies have demonstrated important conse quences of maternal night blindness during pregnancy on the health of the mother and ne wborn infant. We compar ed birthweight, 6-mo infant mortality, morbidity, and growth among in fants of women who di d and did not report a history of night blindness fr om a community-based, randomized trial of newborn vitamin A supplementation in south India. Birthweight was measured within 72 h of delivery. Infants were followed until 6 mo of age for mortality and morb idity was assessed at household visits every 2 wk. Anthropometry was assessed at 6 mo of ag e. A total of 12,829 live-born infants were included, 680 of whom were infants of mothers with ni ght blindness during the index pregnancy. Maternal night blindnes s was associated with an increa sed risk of low birthweight in a dose-dependent fashion based on birthweight cut-offs: <2500 g, ad justed relative risk (RR) = 1.13 (95% CI = 1.01, 1.26); <2000 g, adjusted RR = 1.70 (95% CI = 1.27, 2.26); <1500 g, adjusted RR = 3.38 (95% CI = 1.18, 6.33); with an increased risk of diarrhea (adjusted RR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.30), dysentery (adjusted RR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.53), acute respiratory illness (adjusted RR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.21, 1.44), and poor growth at 6 mo; underweight (adjusted RR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.26), stunting (adjusted RR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.34). Maternal night blindness was not associat ed with 6-mo infant mortality or wasting at 6 mo. This study demonstrates that there are im portant consequences to the infant of maternal vitamin A deficiency during pregnancy. 112Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Nutr J. 2008 Jan 31;7:7. Major reduction of malaria morbidity with combined vitamin A and zinc supplementation in young children in Burkina Faso: a randomized double blind trial. Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. nawidzeb@yahoo.fr BACKGROUND: Vitamin A and zinc are crucial for normal immune function, and may play a synergistic role for reducing th e risk of infection includi ng malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a single dose of 200 000 IU of vitamin A with daily zinc supplementation was done in children of Sourkoudougou village, Burkina Faso. Ch ildren aged from 6 to 72 months were randomized to receive a single dose of 200 000 IU of vitamin A plus 10 mg elemental zinc, six days a week (n = 74) or placebo (n = 74) for a period of six months. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted at the beginning and th e end of the study, and children were evaluated daily for fever. Microscopic examination of blood smear was done in the case of fever (temperature > or =37.5 degrees C) fo r malaria parasite detection. RESULTS: At the end of the study we observed a significant decrease in the prevalence malaria in the supplemented group (34%) compared to the placebo group (3.5%) (p < 0.001). Malaria episodes were lower in the supplemented group (p = 0.029), with a 30.2% reduction of malaria cases (p = 0.025). Time to first malaria episode was longe r in the supplemented group (p = 0.015). The supplemented group also had 22% fewer fever episodes than the placebo group (p = 0.030). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that combined vitamin A plus zinc supplementation reduces the risk of fever and clinic al malaria episodes among children , and thus may play a key role in malaria control stra tegies for children in Africa.

This discrepancy has been explained by an impact on case fatality, although with the exception of hospitalized measles cases, there is little direct evidence to support this hy pothesis. We assessed the impact of newborn dosing with vitamin A on the incidence and case fatality of common childhood morbidities in early infancy in a comm unity-based, randomized trial in South India. Morbidity for each day in the previous 2 wk was assessed for the first 6 mo of life. A total of 11,619 live-born infants were enrolled and rando mized to receive either 48,000 IU (50.4 micromol retinol) of oral vitamin A or placebo following delivery. There was no difference between treatment groups in the incidence of acute or chronic diarrhea, dysentery, or fever but a small increased incidence of acut e respiratory illness (ARI). Case fatality for diarrhea and fever were significantly reduced in the vitamin A group compared with placebo (relative case fatality [95% CI] of 0.50 [0.27, 0.90] and 0.60 [0.40, 0.88], respectively). There was a trend in reduction of case fatality for various definitions of ARI, but the evidence for this effect was modest. Surv ival analysis among those with morbid episodes confirmed the case fatality analysis. This tria l demonstrated that th e reduction in overall mortality due to newborn vitamin A dosing was driven primarily by a reduction in case fatality among infants.

MB . for Human Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland. michael.zimmermann@ilw.agrl.ethz.ch BACKGROUND: Vitamin A (VA) de ficiency (VAD) and iodine deficiency (ID) often coexist in children in Africa. VAD may affect thyroid function and the response to iodine prophylaxis. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the ef fects of supplementation with iodine or VA alone, and in combination, in children w ith concurrent VAD and ID. DESIGN: A 6-mo randomized, double-blind, 2 x 2 intervention tria l was conducted in 5-14 y-old South African children (n = 404), who, on average, had mild-to- moderate VAD and ID. At baseline and after 3 mo, children received 1) iodine (191 mg I as oral iodized oil) + placebo (IS group), 2) VA (200000 IU VA as retinyl palmitate) + placebo ( VAS group), 3) both iodine and VA (IS+VAS group), or 4) placebo. At baseli ne, 3 mo, and 6 mo, urinary io dine thyroid RESULTS: SR and RBP increased significantly with VA supplementation (P < 0.05). For UI, SR, and RBP, there were no significant treatment interacti ons between iodine and vitamin A. The 3-factor and all three 2- factor interactions were signi ficant for thyroid volume, TSH, and thyroglobulin (P < 0.001), 114Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 whereas none of these interactions were signific ant for TT(4). There was a clear effect of VAS without IS on TSH, thyroglobulin, and thyroid volume; all 3 variab les decreased significantly (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Iodine prophylaxis is e ffective in controlling ID in areas of poor vitamin A status. VA supplements are effective in treating VAD in areas of mild ID and have an additional benefit-through supp ression of the pituitary TSHbeta gene, VAS can decrease excess TSH stimulation of the thyroid and thereby reduce the ri sk of goiter and its sequelae.

Dose-response trial of prophylactic zinc supplements, with or without copper, in young Ecuadorian children at risk of zinc deficiency. Wuehler SE , Semp\u00e9rtegui F , Brown KH . Department of Nutrition, Program in Internat ional and Community Nutrition, University of California, Davis, Da vis, CA 95616, USA. BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have shown the benefits of zinc supplementation among young children in high-risk populatio ns. However, the optimal dose and safe upper level of zinc have not been determined. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to measure the effects of different doses of supplemental zinc on the plasma zinc concentration, morbidity, and growth of young children; to det ect any adverse effects of 10 mg supplemental Zn on markers of copper or iron status; and to de termine whether any adverse eff ects are alleviated by providing copper with zinc. DESIGN: This randomize d, double-masked, community-based intervention trial was conducted in 631 Ecua dorian children who were 12-30 mo old at baseline and who had initial length-for-age z scores <-1.3. Children received 1 of 5 daily supplements for 6 mo: 3, 7, or 10 mg Zn as zinc sulfate, 10 mg Zn + 0.5 mg Cu as copper sulfate, or placebo. RESULTS: The change in plasma zinc concentration from baseline was positively related to the zinc dose (P < 0.001). Zinc supplementation, including doses as low as 3 mg/d, reduced the incidence of diarrhea by 21-42% (P < 0.01). There were no other significant group-wise differences. CONCLUSIONS: Zinc supplementation with a dose as low as 3 mg/d increased plasma zinc concentrations and reduced diar rhea incidence in the study popul ation. There were no observed adverse effects of 10 mg Zn/d on indicators of copper or iron status. Th e current tolerable upper level of zinc recommended by the Institute of Medicine should be reassessed for young children. BMJ. 2008 Feb 2;336(7638):266-8. Epub 2008 Jan 8. 115Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Zinc supplementation in children with cholera in Bangladesh. To investigate the impact of zi nc supplementation in children with cholera. DESIGN: Double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial. SETTING: Dhaka Hospital, Bangladesh. PARTICIPANTS: 179 children aged 3- 14 years with watery diarrhoea and stool dark field examination positive for Vibrio cholerae and confirmed by stool culture. INTERVENTION: Children were randomised to r eceive 30 mg elemental zinc per day (n=90) or placebo (n=89) until recovery. All children received erythromycin suspension orally in a dose of 12.5 mg/kg every six hours for three days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Duration of diarrhoea and stool output. Results 82 children in each group completed the study. More patients in the zinc group than in the control group r ecovered by two days (49% v 32%, P=0.032) and by three days (81% v 68%, P=0.03). Zinc supplemented patients had 12% shorter du ration of diarrhoea than control patie nts (64.1 v 72.8 h, P=0.028) CONCLUSION: supplementa significantly diarrhoea and stool ou tput in children with cholera. Children with cholera should be supplemented with zinc to reduce its duration and severity. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trials NCT00226616. J Nutr. 2008 Jan;138(1):108-14. Additional zinc delivered in a liquid supp lement, but not in a fortified porridge, increased fat-free mass accrual among yo ung Peruvian children with mild-to- moderate stunting. Arsenault JE , L\u00f3pez de Van Loan MD , Brown KH . Program in International and Co mmunity Nutrition and Department of Nutrition, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA. The exact mechanism whereby zinc influen ces growth is unknown, although it has been postulated that zinc may stimulate appetite a nd energy intake or enhance fat-free mass (FFM) accrual directly. We compared energy intake, re ported appetite, and body composition of 6- to 8-mo-old Peruvian children with initial length-for-age Z-sc ore (LAZ) < -0.5 SD who were randomly assigned to receive daily for 6 mo: 1) 3 mg/d zinc in a liquid supplement; 2) 3 mg/d zinc in a fortified porridge; or 3) no extra zinc in either the supplement or porridge. There were no group-wise differences in changes in dietar y energy intakes or body composition or in the 116Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 prevalence of reported poor appetite. However, among children with an initial LAZ less than the median (-1.1 SD), those who received zinc as a liquid supplement had a 0.41 kg greater increase in FFM than those who did not receive zinc (P < 0.05). We concluded that daily provision of 3 mg of supplemental zinc did not affect energy intake or reported appetite. Among children with initial mild-to-moderate stunting, those who receiv ed the zinc supplement had a greater increase in FFM than those who did not receive additional zinc. It is possible that the growth-restricted children were more likely to be zinc deficien t and that FFM accrual ma y be an early growth response to supplemental zinc. Zinc supplements may be more efficacious than the same dose of zinc provided in fortified food; therefore, furthe r research is needed on th e optimal level of zinc fortification that will result in improved health outcomes in populations with high rates of zinc deficiency Am J Clin Nutr. 2007 Oct;86(4):1111-9. Longitudinal measures of circulating leptin and ghrelin concentrations are associated with the growth of young Peruvian children but are not affected by zinc supplementation.

BACKGROUND: Leptin, ghrelin, and insulin ar e hormonal regulators of energy balance and, therefore, may be related to growth during infancy. Zinc is essential for growth, and its growth effects may be mediated through these hormones. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of supplemental zinc on plasma leptin, ghrelin, a nd insulin concentrations among young children at risk of zinc deficiency and examined the rela tions between these hormones and physical growth. DESIGN: Children (n = 142) aged 6-8 mo were randomly assigned to receive 3 mg Zn/d as a supplement, in a fortified food, or as a placebo for 6 mo. Relations between hormones and anthropometric z scores, body composition, and growth rates were examined at baseline and 3 and 6 mo after the start of the intervention. RESULTS: No treatment group-related differences were found in plasma leptin, ghreli n, or glucose concentrations or in anthropometric z scores at 3 or 6 mo after the start of the zinc inte rvention. Neither plasma leptin nor ghrelin concentrations at baseline or 3 mo were predictive of subsequent changes in growth. However, changes in weight-for-age z scor es over the two 3-mo time interv als were positively associated with subsequent leptin concentrations and inversely associated with subsequent plasma ghrelin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Supplemental zi nc did not affect the children's growth, anthropometric indexes, or plasma hormone con centrations in this study population. Our results suggest that plasma leptin and ghrelin concentrations in late r infancy are a consequence of previous weight changes rather than predictors of short-term growth. 117Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Lancet. 2007 Oct 6;370(9594):1230-9. Effect of daily zinc supplementation on child mortality in southern Nepal: S . Department of International Health, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21205-2013, USA. jtielsch@jhsp.edu BACKGROUND: Zinc supplemen tation can reduce subsequent morbidity in children recovering from diarrhoea and respiratory illne ss in developing countries. However, whether routine supplementation would decrease morbid ity and mortality in populations with zinc deficiency is unclear. We asse ssed the effect of daily zinc supplementation on children in southern Nepal. METHODS: ity-based, cluster-randomised, trial in child ren aged 1-35 months. Treatment groups were placebo, iron and folic acid, zinc, and iron and folic acid with zinc, with daily doses of 12.5 mg iron, 50 microg folic acid, and 10 mg zinc. Study staff gave children tablets on 2 days each week and left tablets with caregivers for other days . All children received vitamin A supplementation twice per year. Results of the iron arm of the trial have been reported previously. Between October, 2001, and January, 2006, 41,276 children we re enrolled into the placebo (n=20,308) or zinc (n=20,968) groups and were followed- up for 60,636.3 person-years. The primary outcome was child mortality, and analys es were by intention to treat . Daily reports of signs and symptoms of common morbidities in stratified random subsamples of children were assessed every week for 12 months. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00109551. FINDINGS: 2505 children refused to continue the trial and 3219 children were lost to follow-up. There was no significant difference in mortality between the zinc and placebo groups (316 vs 333 deaths; hazard ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.75- 1.12). Zinc had no effect on mortality in children younger th an 12 months (181 vs 168 deaths; 1.04, 0.83-1.31); mortality was lower, but not statistically sign ificantly so, in older children receiving zinc (135 vs 165; 0.80, 0.60-1.06). The frequency and duration of diarrhoea, persistent diarrhoea, dysentery, and acute lower respirato ry infections did not differ between the groups. INTERPRETATION: Total mortality of ch ildren receiving zinc supplementation was not significantly different from that of childre n receiving placebo. Further data are needed from other populations with e ndemic zinc deficiency to confirm the potential age-specific effects reported in this study. PLoS ONE. 2007 Jun 27;2(6):e541. Zinc or multiple micronutrient suppl ementation to reduce diarrhea and respiratory disease in South africa n children: a randomized controlled trial. 118Randomised trials in child health in developing countries 2007-08 Luabeya KK , , Bennish ML . Africa Centre for Health and Population Studies, University of KwaZulu Natal, Somkhele, South Africa. BACKGROUND: Prophylactic zinc supplementation has been shown to reduce diarrhea and respiratory illness in children in many developing countries, but its efficacy in children in Africa is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine if zinc , or zinc plus multiple micronutrients, reduces diarrhea and respiratory dis ease prevalence. DESIGN: Random ized, double-blind, controlled trial. SETTING: Rural community in COHORTS: HIV-uninfected children bor n to HIV-uninfected mothers. INTERVENTIONS: Children received either 1250 IU of vitamin A; vitamin A a nd 10 mg of zinc; or vitamin A, zinc, vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12, C, D, E, and K and copper, io dine, iron, and niacin star ting at 6 months and continuing to 24 months of age. Homes were visited weekly . OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome was percentage of days of di arrhea per child by study ar m within each of the three cohorts. Secondary outcomes were prev alence of upper respiratory symptoms and percentage of children who ever had pneumonia by maternal report, or confirmed by the field worker. RESULTS: Among HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-infected mothers, median percentage of days with diarrhea was 2.3% for 49 children allocated to vitamin A; 2.5% in 47 children allocated to receive vitamin A and zinc ; and 2.2% for 46 children allocated to multiple micronutrients (P = 0.852). Among HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-uninfected mothers, median percentage of days of diarrhea was 2.4% in 56 children in the vitamin A group; 1.8% in 57 children in the vitamin A and zinc group; and 2.7% in 52 children in the multiple micronutrient group (P = 0.857). Only 32 HIV-infected children were enrolled, and there were no differences between treatment arms in the prevalence of diarrhea. The prevalence of upper respiratory symptoms or incidence of pneumon ia did not differ by t reatment arms in any of the cohorts. CONCLUSION: When compared with vitamin A alone, supplementation with zinc, or with zinc and multiple mi cronutrients, did not reduce diarrhea and respiratory morbidity in rural South African children.
