You may have questions about how the vaccine works, if it's safe and what side effects you might have. Pleas e know we're here for you and want to ensure you are making the best decision to protect yourself, your family and community. Racism is a public health crisis and we understand the distrust of health care due to historical racial discrimin ation. Because of this historical injustice, pharmaceutical companies handled this COVID -19 vaccine differently - it has been tested in people of all different ethnicities and is proven safe for everyone. We know how serious the COVID -19 virus is and how it has disproportionately impacted Black and Hispanic communities . The benefit of receiving the COVID - 19 vaccine far outweighs the ris k. The data shows that vaccine is safe. There were no serious safety concerns during clinical trial s. While there have been a few serious reactions, there have been no deaths from the vaccine. Some may experience mild side effects from the vaccine, such as pain or swelling at the injection site, fever, chills, fatigue and headache. These are normal and indicate a person's immune system is responding properly to the vaccine. This vaccine and the vaccination program will help us close the gap of health inequity , but we need everyone to step up when it's their turn to get vaccinated. Because the truth is, the only way we can beat C OVID-19 is together , and vaccination is the only way to end the pandemic. Pleas e know we are here for you, you can count on our doctors , nurses and staff for the information you need to stay safe and healthy. For reactive use i f asked about various conspiracy theories Start from a place of empathy and understanding. Listen to their concerns and then respond to the specific topic/issue . I hear your concerns and want to take a moment to share with you what I know to be true: I know you are concerned about immigration tracking, but I want to assure you the vaccine does not have a microchip in it . I know you are concerned about how quickly the vaccine was developed, but I want to assure you it is safe. Top scientists as well as the National Hispanic Medical Association and the Black Coalition Agai nst COVID -19 endorsed the vacc ines safety. I can assure you that: The vaccine will not give you COVID -19. It will not make you infertile. And it will not change your DNA. We know the risk of getting COVID -19 far outweighs the risk of side effects from the vaccine. Some people may experience short -term mild side effects to the vaccine that resolve themselves and serious reactions are rare. "}
