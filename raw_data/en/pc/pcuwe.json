The stress of repeated failed attempts can be overwhelming. Coincidently some of the most common barriers to conceptions are anxiety and depression. It can become a vicious cycle. What can be done to increase the likelihood of having a baby? Traditional Chinese Medicine For many centuries the power of Qi (pronounced \"chee\") has been central to health and wellness in the Far East. By optimizing the flow of energy that runs through the body, nearly every health concern can be improved or cured. By strategically placing hair-thin needles in the body, obstacles that block the flow of energy can be removed. When it comes to infertility this is essential because it is the energy within that makes conception of a baby possible. From a traditional Chinese medicine perspective, there are several things that can disrupt a women's energy and interrupt the conception process. Among these stress and overwork are very common. Stress Reduction Stress can have a devastating effect on the body as it blocks the flow of Qi, causing pain, discomfort, and decreased functioning in the vital organs. With regard to infertility, this is the ovaries and uterus. Acupuncture is very effective at reducing the stress you feel on a day to day basis by restoring the natural free flow of Qi in your body. Some people may not know they are stressed because they forgot what it feels like to not be stressed. This feeling can be equated to the feeling you get 3-4 days into a vacation. This ancient practice not only helps restore the body's natural balance, it trains your mind and body on what this state feels like. Each treatment is painless and lasts less than an hour with no side effects whatsoever. Undergoing acupuncture treatments for [stress reduction](/acupuncture/mental-emotional/) can enhance fertility by reducing stress' effect on the body. Over Work The vital energy responsible for the egg and sperm coming together is the kidney essence energy know as the kidney jing. When conception occurs the mother passes her kidney jing to the fetus and this energy nourishes the fetus during the pregnancy. Low kidney qi in the mother can be a cause for infertility as the fetus cannot be supported. In most cases kidney qi deficiency will manifest as either yin or yang deficiency and kidney jing supports and creates both. The opposing aspects of the kidney yin and kidney yang play a large part in regulating a women's cycle. So deficiency in one or the other will disrupt the inherent balance. With overwork (physical and mental) our kidney jing can become weakened leading to damage and weakening of the kidney yin or yang energy. Acupuncture and chinese herbs can help to balance and strenghten kidney qi. Other Ways Acupuncture Supports Fertility Blood and Circulation For patients having difficulty with conception acupuncture is also used to increase blood flow to the ovaries and uterus through local stimulation along the merdians. This process ensures the proper nutrients and hormones are getting to the areas needed. When done in conjunction with overall balancing treatments of the energy, this can enhance fertility rates. Hormone Imbalance Nearly every body function is effected by hormones and when hormone levels are out of balance, it can be difficult or impossible to conceive. In fact one of the main areas of emphasis with acupuncture treatment for infertility is to establish regular cycles. Women who have irregular menstrual cycles typically respond well to acupuncture treatments. Other natural [hormone balancing techniques](/weight-loss/hormone-imbalance/) can be used in conjunction with these. Sperm Production In some cases, couples have difficulty conceiving due to low sperm count. Acupuncture can also be used to increase sperm production and quality using the same principals discussed above. Through increased blood flow and improved Qi balance there is increased sperm production. Scientific Evidence Several studies in Europe have proven the effectiveness of acupuncture treatment to increase fertility. The studies confirmed that acupuncture assisted with ovulation, transfer of embryos via IVF, increased live birth rates, and decreased the incidence of IVF ectopic pregnancies. Nutrition and Fertility We know that [good nutrition](/nutrition/) is important to our health but do we really understand how that applies to our daily diet? When combined with acupuncture treatment, nutritional therapy can be very effective in helping a couple conceive. The main culprit that can greatly effect fertility is inflammation. By examining a person's diet and measuring nutrient levels, a naturopathic doctor can help eliminate obstacles that may otherwise prevent conception. Weight Loss and Fertility A sensible diet and moderate exercise plan may not be enough to solve a long-standing battle with your weight. As with many other health problems, excess weight may be caused by hormone imbalance, nutrient deficiencies, and blood sugar difficulties. For Instance, thyroid hormone problems impact a persons' metabolism and can make weight loss impossible. Combine this with insulin issues and you have a recepie for real [weight problems.](/weight-loss/personalized-weight-loss/) Southwest Integrative Medicine If you know a couple that is struggling to conceive, help them find an integrative medical practice like Southwest Integrative Medicine that focuses on reestablishing the inherent natural balance.
