and, WHEREAS, since early March 2020, Illinois has faced a pandemic that has caused extraordinary sickness and loss of life, infecting over 3,480,000, and taking the lives of more than 34,200 residents; and, WHEREAS, as Illinois continues to respond to the public health disaster caused by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel severe acute respiratory illness that spreads rapidly through respiratory transmissions, the burden on residents, healthcare providers, first responders, and governments throughout the State has been unprecedented; and, WHEREAS, numerous variants have emerged over the course of the pandemic and continue to emerge, each with different transmissibility and degrees of severity; and, WHEREAS, predicting what will happen in the future in this pandemic continues to be a difficult task, and proven pandemic mitigations such as social distancing, face coverings and other public health precautions continue to work to slow and stop the spread of COVID-19; and, WHEREAS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued revised guidance on February 25, 2022 to lift its recommendation for universal indoor masking, including in K-12 settings; and, WHEREAS, that guidance provided a framework for assessing community COVID-19 levels based on COVID-19 hospital admissions, inpatient bed availability, and number of COVID-19 cases; and, WHEREAS, the CDC's current guidance recommends universal masking only in communities with high community COVID-19 levels; and, WHEREAS, the CDC continues to advise that some community settings, such as schools and high-risk congregate settings may require additional layers of prevention based on the characteristics of the setting and in the event of an outbreak; and, WHEREAS, even without a State mandate, K-12 schools, childcare facilities, and other settings may choose to require individuals to wear face masks based on the community COVID-19 level and other characteristics of the setting; and, WHEREAS, COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing COVID-19 disease, especially severe illness and death, but a proportion of the population remains unvaccinated and some residents, including children under six months of age, cannot yet receive the vaccine; and, WHEREAS, some employers have entered collective bargaining agreements that continue to require individuals to wear face masks in certain settings, in addition to other mitigation measures; and, WHEREAS, the CDC continues to recommend that individuals who are immunocompromised or at high risk for severe disease consider wearing a well-fitting mask indoors in public settings when the community COVID-19 level is high; and, WHEREAS, the CDC continues to recommend that people with symptoms, a positive test, or exposure to someone with COVID-19 wear a mask; and, WHEREAS, individuals may choose to wear a mask at any time to protect themselves or those around them from spread of COVID-19; and, WHEREAS, CDC guidance continues to recommend that individuals who are not up-to-date on COVID-19 vaccinations or within 90 days of COVID-19 infection stay at home and quarantine for at least 5 days after exposure to COVID-19 and wear a mask until day 10; and, WHEREAS, CDC guidance continues to recommend that individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 stay at home and isolate for at least 5 days after testing positive and wear a mask until day 10; and, WHEREAS, the CDC continues to recommend that students, teachers, and staff should stay home when they have signs of any infectious illness, including COVID-19; and, WHEREAS, schools should continue to collaborate with their local health departments to determine, consistent with CDC guidance, which students, teachers, and staff with positive COVID-19 results or exposure should stay home for the health and safety of the school community; and, WHEREAS, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) continues to require staff at federally-certified healthcare providers to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and strongly recommends staff at federally-certified Long-Term Care and Skilled Nursing Facilities be up-to-date on COVID-19 vaccinations; and, WHEREAS, CMS requires that staff at Long-Term Care and Skilled Nursing facilities who are not up-to-date on their vaccinations be tested at least once per week if the level of COVID-19 community transmission is moderate, and at least twice per week if the level of COVID-19 community transmission is substantial or high; weekly testing is not required if the level of COVID-19 community transmission is low; and, WHEREAS, in addition to causing the tragic loss of more than 34,200 Illinoisans and negatively impacting the physical health of tens of thousands more, COVID-19 has caused extensive economic loss and continues to threaten the financial welfare of a significant number of individuals and businesses across the nation and the State; and, WHEREAS, many executive agencies in the State continue to focus their limited resources on the ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic; and, WHEREAS, on June 24, 2022, considering the expected continuing spread of COVID-19 and the ongoing health and economic impacts that will be felt over the coming month by people across the State, I declared all counties in the State of Illinois as a disaster area; and, WHEREAS, in response to the epidemic emergency and public health emergency described above, I find it necessary to re-issue and modify Executive Orders 2020-12 and 2021-22, and hereby incorporate the WHEREAS clauses of those Executive Orders;
