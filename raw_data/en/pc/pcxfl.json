One whirlwind of a year later (really, where does the time go?), and your toddler can likely now [feed herself](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/feeding-baby/baby-self-feeding/) a bowl of cereal, [walk up the stairs](//www.whattoexpect.com/toddler/growth-and-development/up-stairs-down-stairs.aspx) like an adult by alternating her feet, or even [draw something resembling a person](//www.whattoexpect.com/toddler/scribble/) (though it may look more like a blob with little dot eyes and a line for the mouth \u2014 drawing stick figure people with arms and legs often doesn't happen until closer to the age of 4). Chances are, [her speech](//www.whattoexpect.com/toddler-development/toddler-speech.aspx) has also taken off \u2014 she may be able to hold a short conversation with you, [ ask \"who,\" \"what\" or \"where\" questions](//www.whattoexpect.com/toddler/ask-heidi/why-why-why.aspx), [say her first name when asked](//www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/understand-words/), and talk well enough that even strangers can understand her.

It's good to let her take the lead at times, but remember that she still needs (and secretly wants, even though she may protest) plenty of supervision from you. Here's what else is on the horizon for your 3-year-old. Speaking of communication, don't be surprised if your toddler displays some pretty savvy negotiating skills these days.

If she falls between the 5th and 85th percentiles on the BMI chart, she's likely at a healthy weight.
