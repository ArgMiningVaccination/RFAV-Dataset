The company says this ingredient is derived from coconut oil. It's free from phthalates, sulfates, parabens, chlorine, dyes, and more. One thing to note is the use of fragrance with this shampoo. The brand says it uses \"safe, synthetic, sustainable fragrances (free of phthalates) and natural fragrances.\" This may not be suitable for those with skin sensitivities or those who don't want fragrances at all. Most of the other shampoos on our list use essential oils for fragrances. Another thing to keep in mind is that some reviewers mention it can leave behind a residue. Aside from budget, there are a few key things to consider when shopping for natural shampoo. Check the ingredients First, always scan the labels carefully to see if you may be allergic to any ingredients. Natural ingredients can cause allergic reactions for some. If you're unsure, perform a [patch test](/health/allergy-testing) before using the shampoo. To do a patch test, you can apply the product to a [small patch of skin](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/patch-test-skincare#performing-a-patch-test) in an area where you're unlikely to wash or rub the shampoo away, such as the inside of the arm or bend of the elbow. Watch for any sign of irritation or rash over a period of 24 hours. Consider scents It's also a good idea to decide if you're open to natural scents. Most natural shampoos skip added fragrance and usually go with essential oils to give the shampoo a pleasing scent. Although it's a bit tougher to find, there are some natural shampoos that claim they're fragrance-free. Reading customer reviews can give you a good indication of scents. Think about lather Customer reviews (not paid posts or sponsorships) are also a good place to check out other details like lather. Natural shampoos usually skip sulfates, and those are mainly responsible for giving a nice lather. If reviewers mention a greasy feeling after use, this usually means the shampoo simply can't rinse well enough. Pay attention to hair types Shop for natural shampoos for your hair type. Many natural shampoos will list which hair types its shampoos are best for. This can help you address your specific hair goals. Research the brand You can do some overall research on the brand you're interested in. Some brands have a deeper commitment to keeping out harsh chemicals and use a higher percentage of naturally derived ingredients. Others may rely on marketing to appear more natural compared to other shampoos. It's important to read the complete ingredient list on any shampoo before you buy. Some shampoo ingredients you may wish to avoid include: Formaldehyde Formaldehyde may also be referred to as formalin, the substance it turns into when mixed with water. It's sometimes included in products that have keratin in them, and is a known carcinogen. Phthalates [Phthalates](healthline.com/health-news/what-are-phthalates-and-why-are-they-in-mac-and-cheese) are endocrine disruptors that may have adverse effects on the reproductive system of males and females, including infants and fetuses. Fragrance Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations don't require personal care products to list individual fragrance ingredients. If a shampoo label includes the word \"fragrance\" without specifying which type, it may contain items, such as phthalates, that you wish to avoid. Parabens [Parabens](healthline.com/health/methylparaben) are used as preservatives in a wide range of products, including shampoos. They have estrogenic properties. Since they've been detected in the breast tissue of women with breast cancer, there's some concern about their safety, although their role in this or any disease hasn't been definitively proven. Sulfates [Sulfates](/health/beauty-skin-care/sulfates) are surfactants and used to make shampoos sudsy. They're a byproduct of petroleum, an industry which generates greenhouse gasses and pollution. Sulfates can be irritating to the scalp, skin, and eyes in some people. For that reason, products containing sulfates are usually tested on animals, such as rabbits. Sulfates may negatively affect aquatic life and ecosystems. Natural alternatives to sulfates include sarsaparilla, soap bark, soapwort, agave, and ivy. Triclosan Triclosan is an antibacterial agent that was banned for use in antibacterial soap by the FDA. It's been found in groundwater, soil, oceans, and lakes around the world. Triclosan is a known endocrine disruptor that's been linked to adverse cardiovascular effects, cancer, and developmental issues in infants. PFAS Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been linked to cancer, a weakened immune system, and thyroid disease. Choosing a shampoo with no toxins can be better for your health and the environment. Harmful ingredients in the products we use each day wind up in our oceans, where they cause damage to wildlife and underwater environments, such as coral reefs. What counts as natural? \"Organic,\" \"botanical,\" and \"plant-based\" are some terms used to identify natural shampoos. Keep in mind that there's no legal requirement that a shampoo needs to meet in order to be considered natural. That's why we took a closer look at the ingredients. A few words about how to shampoo hair, as even the best shampoo will fall flat if you use it incorrectly: - Many people tend to over-shampoo their hair. In general, washing your hair every other day or every third day is usually sufficient, no matter what hair type you have, including oily hair. - The shampoo you choose should be geared toward your hair type and any scalp conditions you have. Keep in mind that your hair changes as you age. Your go-to choice 20 years ago may no longer be the best shampoo for your current hair needs. - When washing your hair, gently massage shampoo into your hair and scalp, then rinse thoroughly. - If you use a conditioner after shampooing, leave it in for at least 5 minutes, then rinse out with cool water. - Don't pull or tug at your hair when it's wet. This can break the ends. If you comb the conditioner through your hair after washing, use a wide-comb brush or your fingers. - The water temperature you use also has an effect on your hair. Warm or cool water is best for washing hair. Water that's too hot can strip color from dyed hair, and it may make hair dry and cause flyaways. Anecdotally, some people find that giving their hair a final rinse in cold water makes it shinier. What are the best natural shampoo ingredients? This depends on your hair type. For example, for dry hair types, coconut oil and shea butter work to boost moisture. Those with oily hair may see results from apple cider vinegar and [witch hazel](/nutrition/witch-hazel-benefits-uses). Natural ingredients that can lather without sulfates include sarsaparilla, soap bark, soapwort, agave, and ivy. Is it possible to find a shampoo without chemicals? There are brands out there that use almost entirely naturally derived ingredients. The goal is to find a natural shampoo that works for your hair, skips the harsh stuff, and uses ingredients mostly from nature. Are natural shampoos actually better for your hair? Skipping ingredients like sulfates, parabens, and formaldehyde (to name a few) is a gentler, safer experience for hair. It may take some trial and error to find the best natural shampoo for your hair type. But when you do, you may see less irritation and healthier-looking hair. Just make sure you aren't allergic to the ingredients before using. There's a large and ever-increasing demand for all-natural products that aren't harmful to our health and the planet. Natural shampoos that can clean and soften all types of hair, without adding to our carbon footprint or toxic load, are available. "}
