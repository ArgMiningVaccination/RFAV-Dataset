The EC Zoos Directive (Directive 1999/22/E C) requires EU Member States to regulate zoos in accordance with its provisions. The Di rective is transposed into national legislation in Wales by means of the Zoo Licensi ng Act 1981 (Amendment) ( Wales) Regulations 2003. The Secretary of State's powers in Se ction 9 of the Zoo Licensing Act 1981 (the 1981 Act) have been transferred to the National Assembly for Wales (the Assembly) by way of the National Assembly for Wale s (Transfer of Function) Order 1999. 2. In pursuance of section 9 of the Act , the Assembly , hav ing consulted such persons on a list compiled under Section 8 of the 1981 Ac t, and other persons as it has seen fit, hereby specifies the following Standards of Modern Zoo Practice (\"Standards\"); that is, Standards with respect to the management of z oos and the animals in them. Due to the widely differing nature of zoo co llections, not every Standard will apply equally to all zoos. 3. To aid the application of these Standar ds, pre-inspection audit forms and inspection report forms are provided at Appendix 10 and 11 respectively. Pre-inspection audit forms should be completed by zoo operators prior to inspections and inspection report forms should be used by Zoo Inspectors to report their findings. 4. Compliance with these Standards does not guarantee that the r equirements of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 and ot her relevant legislation have been met. In particular, attention is drawn to guidance issued by the Health and Safety Commission, relating to safety, health and welfare standards fo r employers and persons at work in zoos. Zoo operators are strongly advised to acquaint themselves with these requirements and other relevant legislation in cluding that on transport of ani mals, fire prevention and food hygiene. 5. These Standards are supplemented by t he Zoos Forum Handbook which provides further detail and guidance (available from Defr a, also published on the Assembly website at http://www.wales.gov.uk/ ). Interpretation of terms used 6. The following terms as defined here are used in these Standards and in associated documentation. 'animal' means animals of the classe s Mammalia, Aves, Reptilia, Pisces and Insecta (i.e. any mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, fish or insect) or other multicellular organism that is not a plant or fungus; 'animal training' is the modification of an animal's behaviour by a human carer to achieve a goal, using appropriate rewards; 'circus' means a place where animals are k ept or introduced wholly or mainly for the purpose of performing tricks or manoeuvres at that place; 'enclosure' means any accommo dation provided for zoo animals; Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 'enclosure barrier' means a physical barrier to contain an animal within an enclosure; 'keeper' includes any person employed under the direction of a keeper; 'the list' means the list compiled by the A ssembly under section 8 of the Act . This list comprises persons responsible for the in spection of animals in zoos, advising on their keeping and welfare, and management of zoos generally; 'pet shop' means premises for whose keeping as a pet shop a licence is in force, or is required, under the Pet Animals Act 1951; 'stand-off barrier' means a physical barri er set back from the outer edge of an enclosure barrier in order to provi de further distance between the public and exhibited animals; 'taxonomic category' means a group or assemblage of species recognised as an entity in scientific classification; 'wild animal' means any animal not norma lly domesticated in Great Britain; \"Zoo\" is defined under the Act as an establishment where wild animals (as defined above) are kept for exhibition to the public otherwise than for purposes of a circus (as defined above) and otherwise than in a pet shop (as defined above). The 1981 Act applies to any zoo to which members of the public have access, with or without charge for admission, on seven days or mo re in any period of 12 consecutive months. Under the EC Zoos Directi ve, zoos may be exempted from the requirements of the Directive on the grounds that they do not exhibit a significant number of animals or species to the public and that the exemption will not jeopardise the objectives of the Directive. Animal Welfare in the Zoo Environment 7. The five principles below, described in more detail in subsequent sections, provide a framework for the Standards. These five pr inciples are based on the 'Five Freedoms' drawn up for livestock by the Farm Animal Welfare Council. PROVISION OF FOOD AND WATER 8. Both food and water are basic needs. The method of food presenta tion, the frequency of feeds and the nutritional balance must be tak en into account. Food should be presented in a manner and frequency commensur ate with the natural behaviour of the species, as well as its nutri tional requirements, which may vary according to season. PROVISION OF A SUITABLE ENVIRONMENT 9. An environment consistent with species r equirements must be provided. This should include shade and shelter from rain, heat and cold as appropriate. For example, animals that dig and root must be provided with suit able substrates, and clim bers with appropriate three dimensional environment s. A balance must be struck between hygiene and the species' biological requirements. PROVISION OF ANIMAL HEALTHCARE Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 10. Injury: The provision of an enclosure designed to minimise the risk of injury is required. The design should allow animals to get away fr om each other. In mix ed species' exhibits, care should be taken that one species cann ot injure another. Enclosures should be designed to minimise the risk of predators entering the exhibit. 11. Disease: Curative and preventive veterinary medicine should be provided. Every effort must be made to provide a correct diet and suitably hygienic environment from which pathogens are excluded or controlled. PROVISION OF AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS MOST NORMAL BEHAVIOUR 12. Animals should be allow ed the opportunity to express most normal behaviour, taking into account current enric hment and husbandry guidelines. PROVISION OF PROTECTION FROM FEAR AND DISTRESS 13. Particular areas to look at are: group composition, sex ratios and numbers of animals in an enclosure and space and furniture in both indoor and outdoor areas. Zoo animals are often confined for long periods in indoor ar eas and the group composition should reflect this situation. 14. Enclosure design should allo w for as much normal behaviour as possible, and provide areas of escape from ot her animals and the public. 15. Animals often benefit fr om mixed species environment s. However, inter-species conflict can cause stress and this needs to be monitored, recorded and reviewed, including safety from potential predators. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. Section 2 - Standards 1. Provision of Food and Water 1.1 Food provided must be presented in an appropriate manner and must be of the nutritive value, quantity, quality and variety fo r the species, and its condition, size and physiological, reproductive and health status. 1.2 Fresh, clean drinking water of sufficient quant ity must be available at all times for all animals requiring it. 1.3 Supplies of food and drink to be kept and prepared under hygienic conditions, in particular - a) food and drink must be protected against dampness, deterioration, mould or from contamination by insects, birds, vermin or other pests; b) supplies of perishable f ood and drink, other than thos e brought into the premises fresh on a daily basis, should be kept, where appropriate, under refrigeration; c) preparation of food and, where appropriate, drink should be undertaken in a separate area suitably design ed and constructed, and us ed for no other purpose; d) staff should be instructed to observe strict standards of personal hygiene and should conform to good hygiene practice in the preparation of food, having due regard to the risk of cross contamination between equipment, utensils and surfaces; e) receptacles for food and drink should not to be used for any other purposes. 1.4 The natural behaviour of t he animals, particularly social aspects, should be considered when offering food and drink. Feeding and drin king receptacles, when used, should be of appropriate design and placed so as to be acce ssible and available to every animal kept in an enclosure. (See Appendix 8 - Specialist Exhibits) 1.5 Feeding methods should be safe for animals and staff. 1.6 Although the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 to 1964 do not prohibit the feeding of animals with live prey, the live feeding of vertebrate prey should be avoided save in exceptional circumstances, and then only under veterinary advice. Where any live prey must be used, it s welfare must be considered as well as any potential injury which might be caused to the predator. 1.7 Food and drink, and feeding and drinking re ceptacles when used, should be placed in positions which minimise the risks of contami nation from soiling by the animals, wild birds, rodents or other pests. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 1.8 Food, water and other drinking receptacle s, where used, should be regularly cleaned. 1.9 Self-feeders, where used, should be inspec ted twice daily to ensure that they are working effectively and do not contain caked or unfit food. Water lines should also be checked twice a day. 1.10 Uncontrolled feeding of animals by visi tors should not be permitted. Where controlled feeding occurs, it should be on a selective basi s only, with suitable food sold, provided or approved by the operator. The quantity supplied per day mu st be managed to avoid over feeding. 1.11 Uneaten food must be removed as appropriate to maintain hygiene. 1.12 Veterinary or other specialist advice in all aspects of nutrition must be obtained and followed. 1.13 A record of all diets must be maintained. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 2. Provision of a Suitable Environment 2.1 The temperature, ventilation , lighting (both levels and s pectral distribution) and noise levels of enclosures must be suitable for the comfort and well-bein g of the particular species of animal at all times. In particular: a) consideration must be given to the special needs of pregnant and newly-born animals; b) newly-arrived imported animals should be allowed to become fully acclimatised into their new environmen t. In some cases, this may be a gradual process; c) tanks for aquatic animals need to be adequat ely aerated, according to the number kept in each tank, and must be heated or cooled according to the needs of the species. Environmental parameters (e.g. sa linity, water quality) must be suitable for the species; d) indoor housing must protect against extr emes of sunlight, heat, draughts and cold, and provide appropria te humidity; e) where appropriate, salinity and other physical limits (e .g. water quality) must be suitable for the species. (See Appendix 8 - Specialist Exhibits) 2.2 Animals in outdoor enclosure s must be provided with sufficien t shelter for their comfort and well-being. Refuge areas must be prov ided for nervous animals to escape the permanent gaze of the public. Enclosures must also be designed to allow for animals' normal defence reactions and appropria te 'flight' or escape distances. 2.3 Enclosures and barriers to enclosures must be maintained in a condition which presents no likelihood of harm to animals. In particular: a) any defect noted in an enclosure barrier or in any appliances or equipment within animal enclosures likely to cause harm must be repaired, or replaced or the animal relocated immediately and recorded on keepers' daily record sheets; b) any defect likely to cause harm to animals must be rectified at onc e. If this is not possible, the animals should be removed from the possibility of any contact with the source of the danger until rectified; c) any vegetation capable of harming ani mals must be kept out of reach; d) water-filled and dry moats used for the c onfinement of animals must provide a means of escape back to the enclosure for animals falling into them; e) any natural materials (e.g. plants and their products, such as seeds or fruit) or any introduced non-natural materials (e.g. pain t, chemicals, treated substrates and treated water) should be assessed for toxici ty to the species held before use. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 2.4 All plant and fixed equipment, including elec trical apparatus, must be installed and maintained in such a way that they do not present a hazard to animals, and their safe operation cannot be di srupted by them. 2.5 Where environmental quality is dependen t on external utilities, adequate backup facilities must exist in case of failure. 2.6 Adequate provision must be made for servicing, maintenance and uninterrupted operation of life-support systems. 2.7 Tools and other portable equi pment must not be left unatt ended in places where they could cause animals harm, provide a means of escape, or serve as missiles. 2.8 Rubbish likely to cause harm in animal enclosures must be cleared as soon as possible. 2.9 Proper standards of hygiene, both in the personal hygiene of staff and in enclosures and treatment rooms should be ma intained. In particular: a) special attention must be given to the management and appropriate cleaning of enclosures and equipment within t hem, to reduce the risk of di sease. In the case of aquatic animals, there should be regul ar monitoring of water quality; b) suitable cleaning agents mu st be readily available, al ong with supplies of water and the appropriate safe means to apply them; c) veterinary advice must be obtained and fo llowed regarding t he routine cleaning and sanitation requirements of enclosures or other areas. Particular care must be taken if an infectious disease is identified in any animal. 2.10 The drainage of all enclosures should be capable of removing efficiently all excess water. 2.11 Any open drains, other than those carrying surfac e water, must be outside enclosures. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 3. Provision of Animal Health Care Routine observation 3.1 The condition, health and behaviour of a ll animals should be checked at least twice daily by the person or persons in direct charge of their care. 3.2 Any animals which give cause for concer n must be thoroughly assessed as to whether they are unduly distressed, sick or injured. W here necessary they must receive immediate attention and treatment. 3.3 A daily record must be kept by the person or persons in direct charge of the animals, indicating changes to the prescribed di et, health checks carried out, any unusual behaviour or activity or other probl ems, and remedial actions taken. Enclosures 3.4 Enclosures must be of a size and des ign, and animals and enclosures must be so managed as to: a) avoid animals within her ds or groups being unduly dom inated by individuals; b) avoid the risk of persistent and unr esolved conflict between herd or group members, or between di fferent species or age groups in mixed exhibits; c) ensure that the physical carrying capacit y of the enclosure and/or system is not over-burdened; d) prevent an uncontrolled bui ld-up or spread of parasites and other pathogens; e) remove any refuse and al low drainage of waste water. 3.5 Trees within or near animal enclosures must be regularly inspected and lopped or felled as necessary to avoid animals being ha rmed by falling branches, toxicity or trauma. Trees and climbing plants must be pruned to prevent their aiding animal escape. 3.6 Distance or barriers between animals an d between enclosures and visitors must be sufficient to minimise transmission of disease or potential pathogens. Veterinary Care (See Appendix 5 - Veterinary Facilities) 3.7 A comprehensive programme of care mu st be established and maintained under the supervision of a veterinary surgeon who is familia r with current practice in the care of zoo Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. animals, particularly in the types maintained in the collection. He or she must make arrangements to meet the ethical responsibilities of veterinary cover, set out in the Guide to Professional Conduct of the Roya l College of Veterinary Surgeons. 3.8 Where a zoo uses a local ve terinary practice for basic cover, supported by a specialist (or a specialist supported by a local vete rinary practice), adequate advance arrangements must be made to allow early contact and discussion between all parties whenever necessary, and particularly for emergency cases. 3.9 The veterinary surgeon should be responsib le for, or actively involved in, the following:- a) routine inspections of the collection; b) directing or carrying out treatment of all sick animals; c) administration of vaccines, worming and ot her aspects of preventive medicine; d) health monitoring of animals including submission of blood and other samples for laboratory examination; e) safe and proper collection, preparati on and dispatch of diagnostic and other samples. (Where these tasks are to be ca rried out by someone other than the veterinary surgeon, a suitably qualified or appropriately tr ained member of zoo staff should be nominated to carry out the task e.g. a laboratory technician or veterinary nurse); f) training of zoo personnel in health and hygiene; g) ensuring that post-mortem examinat ions of animals are carried out where necessary; h) supervision of quarantine pr emises and other such tasks required by law or as part of good zoo veterinary practice; i) the nutrition and the design of diets; j) planning and exhibit design; k) the establishment of written procedur es to be followed in the event of the accidental use of dangerous drugs. 3.10 The level of veterinary facilities must be consistent with t he welfare needs of the animals. 3.11 Comprehensive records must be kept - w here possible on comput er - and be made available to Inspectors covering the following: a) preventive medicine; Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. b) clinical medicine and surgery; c) pathological findings from ante-mort em testing. Results of post-mortem examination and testing. 3.12 There must be systems for regular review, by the relev ant veterinary and curatorial staff, of clinical, behavioural and patholog ical records and mortality. Husbandry and preventive medical practices must be re viewed where problems become apparent. 3.13 Zoo management must ensure t hat the zoo, or a local hospi tal, or their veterinarian has readily available antidotes to potentiall y toxic veterinary products used at the zoo. 3.14 A member of staff must be readily available at all time s to take decisions regarding the euthanasia of sick animals on veterinary advice. There must be provision of an effective humane method of euthanasia and st andard written protocols should be set down. 3.15 Adequate facilities must be available either at the zoo or within a reasonable distance for the post-mortem examination of all species held at the zoo. 3.16 Dead animals must be handled in a way whic h minimises the risk of transmission of infection. 3.17 Animals that die at the zoo should be examined post-mortem in accordance with veterinary advice. Where appropriate, samples for diagnosis or health monitoring should be taken for laboratory examination. 3.18 Retained samples must be stored in co nditions advised by the veterinary surgeon and away from animal feeding substances. The establishment of a reference collection should be encouraged. Isolation & Containment 3.19 Dedicated accommodation, off-show w here necessary, should be available for the isolation and examinat ion of newly arrived animals, and for the quarantine and care of unduly distressed, sick or injured animals. 3.20 Facilities should be available for hand-rearing and nursing animals. 3.21 Newly-arrived animals should be kept isol ated as long as is necessary to ensure proper examination, acclimatis ation and quarantine bef ore introduction to other animals in the collection. (See Appendix 4 - Animal Transactions) 3.22 Particular attention must be paid to hygiene in the quarters where isolated or quarantined animals are kept. 3.23 Protective clothing and utensils used by staff in the isolatio n area must be used, cleaned and stored onl y in that area. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. Sanitation And Control Of Disease 3.24 Clinical waste and refuse must be regul arly removed and disposed of in a manner approved by the Local Authority. 3.25 A safe and effective programme for the c ontrol or deterrence of pests and vermin and where necessary predators, must be est ablished and maintained throughout the zoo. 3.26 Health risks posed by the use of power hoses on animal waste must be minimised. 3.27 Staff must be instructed to report in conf idence any medical condition or disability which might affect his/her capacity to m anage the animals in a safe and competent manner. Specialist Techniques 3.28 Specialist techniques used on animals to make them safe for exhibi t or to allow them to be exhibited in a particular way (e.g. pinion ing waterfowl) must be kept under continual review. Current legislation or code s of practice must be followed. (See Appendices: 2 - Ethical Review Process; and 8 - Specialist Exhibits) 4. Provision of Opportunity to Express Most Normal Behaviour 4.1 Captive breeding should be encouraged wher e appropriate and a policy should exist covering all species kept, and be subject to continual review. Appropriate control measures should be put in plac e to prevent over population. 4.2 Zoos must consult fully and keep up-to-date information on biology and husbandry, especially when considering the keeping of species that t hey have not housed before, or when planning new housing for species already kept. 4.3 Accommodation should take a ccount of the natural habitat of the species and seek to meet the physiological and psychol ogical needs of the animal. 4.4 Enclosures should be equipped in acco rdance with the needs of the animals with bedding material, branchwork, burrows, nesti ng boxes, pools, sub-strates and vegetation and other enrichment materials designed to aid and encourage normal behaviour patterns and minimise any abnormal behaviour. Facilities mu st take into account growth in animals and must be capable of satisfacto rily providing for their needs at all stages of their growth and development. 4.5 Animals of social species should normally be maintained in compatible social groups. They should only be kept isolat ed for the benefit of the conservation and welfare needs of the group, and where this is not detri mental to the individual specimen. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 4.6 Animals of different taxa should not normally be allowed to inter-breed. Where practised for justifiable reasons, it should never compromise the genetic integrity of animals within a managed cons ervation breeding programme. 4.7 Where a hybrid animal is transferred to another collecti on, the recipient organisation must be informed that the anima l is a hybrid. If practical, the animal should be permanently sterilised prior to transfer. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 5. Provision of Protection From Fear and Distress 5.1 Animals must be handled and managed only by, or under the supervision of, appropriately qualified or experienced staff. Handling must be done with care, in order to protect the animals we ll-being, and avoid unnecessary disco mfort, stress or physical harm. 5.2 Any direct physical contact between animals and the visiting public must only be for restricted periods of time and under conditions consistent with anima ls' welfare, and not likely to lead to their discomfort. 5.3 Animals must not be provoked fo r the benefit of t he viewing public. (See Appendix 6 - Animal-Contact areas) 5.4 Animals which may interact in an excessive ly stressful way must not be maintained in close proximity. 5.5 Suitable, separate if appropriate, accommodation for pregnant animals and animals with young should be availabl e in order to minimise unnecessary stress. 5.6 Animals temporarily accommodated away from others should not be separated for such a period of time that there would be diffi culties in their re-introduction to the group. 5.7 Animals destined for rehabilitation (e.g. cas ualty animals) must not be on public display if this is likely to causes stress or compromise their eventual release. 5.8 Smoking by zoo staff must be prohibi ted except in designat ed areas. In open-air collections smoking by visitors must be prohi bited where the health and welfare of other visitors and animals will be compromised, e.g. in public access animal houses. In enclosed collections, e.g. aquaria, smok ing must only be in designated areas. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 6. Transportation and Movement of Live Animals 6.1 Surplus zoo stock should only be passed on to responsible persons who have the appropriate facilities, resources and expertise to ensure the welfare of the animals. Where necessary, the appropriate licences for the keeping and management of the species must be held. 6.2 Facilities suitable for lifting, crating and trans portation of all the types of animals kept within the zoo to destinations both inside and outside the zoo should be readily available. 6.3 Zoos must ensure that they comply fu lly with the requirement s of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (C ITES) which governs the import, export, sale and other commercial use - including display - of species listed on its Appendices. CITES is implemented within the EU by way of tw o Regulations which in many respects are stricter that CITES itself. Further informati on on the CITES Regulati ons is reproduced in the bibliography. Other considerations to be taken into account when animals are moved to accommodation outside the zoo include: a) transport must conform with all other current Regulations, including Defra and IATA provisions. b) the accommodation the animal is being mov ed to, and the animals it is to be mixed with, must not compromise t he welfare of that individual or the other animals. (See Appendix 4 - Animal Transactions) 6.4 Catching and transportation techniques must take account of the animal's temperament and escape behaviour in order to minimise injury, damage and distress. 6.5 Any animal taken outside t he zoo must be in the personal possession of the operator of the zoo, or of compet ent persons acting on his/her behalf, and adequate provision must be made for its and the public's safety and well-being. (See Appendices: 4 - Animal Transactions a nd; Appendix 7 - Training of Animals) 6.6 All animals taken outside the zoo must be kept securely at all times. Animals should be kept away from direct contact with persons other than the zoo operator or competent persons acting on his/her behalf, unless the zoo oper ator is satisfied that the animal is not likely, when under control, to su ffer distress or cause injury or to transmit or contract disease. Zoo operators should exercise caution and discretion in the case of the removal of all animals from the zoo, since their behaviour may beco me less predictable when away from their usual enclosures. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 7. Conservation and Education Measures (See also Appendix 1 - The EC Zoos Dir ective and Appendix 3 - Conservation and Education) 7.1 Long recognised as an impor tant feature of UK zoos , conservation and education became subject to legislative control in the UK when the EC Zoos Directive came into force. The Directive made it a formal statutory requirement fo r the first time that zoos implement the following measures: a) participating in research from which conser vation benefits accrue to the species, and/or training in relevant cons ervation skills, and/or the exchange of information relating to species conservation and/or, where appropriate, captiv e breeding, repopulation or reintroduction of species into the wild and; b) promoting public education and awareness in relation to the conser vation of biodiversity, particularly by providing information about the species exhibited and th eir natural habitats. 7.2 These requirements, referred to as conservation and education measures respectively, have been transposed into domestic legislation (the Zoo Licensing Act 1981 as amended) and are furt her explained below. 7.3 In addition to these st atutory requirements, as a general principle zoos should establish ethical review processes and, w here appropriate, seek appropriate help in planning and implementing their c onservation and education strategies. (See Appendix 2 - Ethi cal Review Process) Conservation Measures Within And Beyond The Zoo 7.4 The Directive requires that zoos undertake conservation measures and gives a number of options for doing so. The options given in the Directive for conservation measures are: participating in research from which c onservation benefits accrue to the species, and/or; training in relevant conservation skills, and/or; the exchange of information relati ng to species conservation and/or; where appropriate, captive br eeding, repopulation or reintr oduction of species into the wild. 7.5 Zoos must therefore undertake, as a mi nimum, at least one of these options. The measures required should be proportionate to the size and type of the zoo. 7.6 Where the relevant species are held, a zoo must be an active participant in recognised species management programmes. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 7.7 Zoos should be able to demonstrate thei r conservation measures, including research if undertaken. Areas to be exam ined will include overall conser vation policy, and how this relates to the World Zoo and Aquarium Conser vation Strategy, and type and level of input into international conservation programmes. 7.8 Zoos should generally be able to demonstrate that they encourage research. Research can be developed through forging lin ks with Higher Education Institutions. Full details of such projects should be available on request. 7.9 In any research carried ou t, care must be taken to comply with all relevant legislation and be subject to ethical review. Education Measures 7.10 The Directive requires that zoos mu st promote public educat ion and awareness in relation to the conservation of biodiversity, particularly by providing information about the species exhibited and their natural habi tats. The measures required should be proportionate to the size and type of the zoo. 7.11 A zoo must have a written education strategy and an active education programme. 7.12 Suitable facilities, commensurate to the size of the zoo, should be available for education purposes. 7.13 Accurate information about the species ex hibited must be available. Generally, this should include, as a minimum, the species name (both scientific and common), its natural habitat, some of its biological characterist ics and details of its conservation status. 7.14 Other areas to be examined include: the educational role of the zoo as set out in any mission statement; how the written education plan applies to different sections of the zoo's visitors. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 8. Public Safety in the Zoo Principles 8.1 Section 5(7) of the Act states 'The authority shall not a ttach to a licence a condition which relates only or primarily to the health, sa fety or welfare of persons working in the zoo.' These are dealt with under separat e Health and Safety legislation. 8.2 Points regarding the contai nment of hazardous animals are particularly important to the animals' welfare, as actions following escapes may result in the injury or death of the animal in order to guard public safety. 8.3 Risk assessments relating to public safe ty should be undertaken where appropriate and significant findings should be availabl e for examination by the Inspector. Insurance 8.4 Zoo operators must have insurance cover which covers them and every other person under a contract of service or acting on t heir behalf, against liability for any damage or injury which may be caused by any of the an imals, whether inside or outside the zoo, including during transportation to other premis es. Any upper limit on the sum insured must be set at an adequate but realistic level. Enclosures 8.5 Other than when under the cont rol of authorised staff, animals kept in the zoo must be maintained at all times in enclosures or, in the case of free-running animals, within the perimeter of the zoo. 8.6 All animals should be kept in enclosures so constructed as to avoid escape. Gates and doors to enclosures must be securely locked so as to prevent unauthorised opening. 8.7 Barriers must be designed, construct ed and maintained to contain animals within enclosures. Enclosures must be free from any vegetation or other items which would aid escape. 8.8 Gates and doors to enclosures must be at least as strong, and as effective in containing the animals, as the re st of the enclosure barriers. In particular, gates and doors should be designed and maintained so as to pr event animals from lifting them from their hinges or unfastening the securing device. 8.9 Gates and doors to animal enclosures where the public are admitted, and any enclosure or stand-off barrier, must be designed, constructed and maintained so as not to trap or otherwise injure visitors, particul arly children or those with disabilities. (See Appendix 6 - Animal Contact areas) Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 8.10 Animals which can climb or jump s hould be kept in enclosures secure enough to prevent them from escaping. Digging or burrowing hazardous animals must be kept in enclosures so constructed as to avoid escape underneath barriers. 8.11 Viewing panels used in enclosures should be able to withstand attacks by animals. (See Appendix 8 - Specialist Exhibits) 8.12 Where fences are used to enclose animal s, the supporting posts must be firmly fixed into the ground. Fence material should be suffici ently secured to supporting posts in such a way that the weight of the animal enclose d could not detach it from the support nor dislodge the supporting posts. MANAGEMENT AND MAINTENANCE 8.13 Buildings, structures and areas to which the public have access must be maintained in safe condition. 8.14 The visiting public should not be allowed to enter any buildings or other areas of the zoo premises which could present an unr easonable risk to their health and safety. (See Appendix 6 - Animal Contact Areas) 8.15 Areas where visitors are encouraged to go should have even, non-slip, surfaces, or be grassed, to avoid the risk, as far as is re asonably practicable, of visitors falling. Since grassed slopes may be slippery, consideration must be given to creating steps, paths or fitting rails. 8.16 Where a flight of steps is used as a means of access for visitors within the premises, a handrail should also be provided. Considerat ion should be given to providing shallow gradients for pushchairs and disabled access. 8.17 Trees within areas where visi tors are likely to be walking or sitting should be regularly inspected and lopped or felled as appropriate to avoid visitors being harmed by falling branches or permitting them becoming an aid to animal escape. Similarly, vegetation such as nettles and thistles should be controlled to avoid injury to visitors. 8.18 Where a walkway passes over an ani mal enclosure it should be designed, constructed and maintained to ensure that it is safe. It should also be maintained, sited and protected so as to wit hstand contact by animals. Protection Of Public 8.19 Every person licensed to use a fire-arm mu st undergo training. Ev ery trained operator should undergo periodic refresher training and practice. Such training should be recorded and available for inspection. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 8.20 Firearms should be available where zoos hold carnivores listed in category 1 of Appendix 12. Fire-arms, ammunition and darti ng equipment, where pr ovided, must be: a) available for immediate use b) used by licensed and trained operators only; c) cleaned and maintained as recommended by the manufacturer; d) kept securely under lock and key w hen not in use or under maintenance. 8.21 Appropriate staff must be trained in drug handling, risks, side effects, human risks if misused, and emergency protocols. 8.22 Where used to contain animals, moats (whether wet or dry) must be surrounded by fences, walls, hedges or shrubbery sufficient to prevent the public from approaching too close to the edge. Consideration should be gi ven to whether rescue equipment such as lifebuoys should be provided. 8.23 Barbed, razor wire or electrified fenc es should be beyond the reach of members of the public. 8.24 Stand off barriers must be provided and be designed, where necessary, to ensure public safety. 8.25 Safety barriers should be designed to prev ent children either from getting through, under or over them. They should also be des igned to discourage visitors sitting on them. Free-Ranging Species 8.26 Section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 prohibits the deliberate release or permitting to escape into the wild of non-indigenous species. This is particularly important if free-ranging species are kept in t he zoo but not confined in enclosures. 8.27 The EC Zoos Directive requires that zoos are active in '...preventing the escape of animals in order to avoid possible ecol ogical threats to indigenous species'. 8.28 Zoos must take into account the W ildlife and Countryside Act 1981 where there are free-flying psittacine birds or birds of prey in flying displays. Zoos must be aware of the legislation and take every precaution to prevent escapes. Particular points to note are: bird of prey centres who use birds in flying demonstrations should train birds sufficiently to ensure their return; where possible, transmitters should be used to help zoo staff to locate birds which have strayed. Zoos which allow psittacines to free-fly should encourage them to remain on site by providing roosting areas, nestboxes, and feeding points. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. Enough staff should be available to retrieve birds when lost. (See Appendix 8.7 - Birds of Prey) ESCAPES 8.29 The perimeter boundary, including access points, shoul d be designed, constructed and maintained to discourage unauthorised entry and, so far as is reasonably practicable, as an aid to the confinement of all the animals within the zoo. 8.30 Zoos must have systems in place to mini mise the risks of theft, malicious damage or release of animals by intruders entering the grounds out of hours. 8.31 Zoo operators must assess whether any danger may arise in the event of an animal escaping from its enclosure, and consider t he possible or likely attempted escape route from the zoo if this were to happen. 8.32 Every effort must be made, so far as it is reasonably practicable, to effect the recovery, live or dead, of any escaped animals. 8.33 The procedures to be adopted in the event of escapes within or fr om the zoo (or of accidental or unauthorised releases) of any anima l should be brought to the attention of, and available to, all members of staff in a written document. 8.34 Procedures relating to escapes of animals should be established and include the following: the reporting of every esc ape by the quickest possible means to the most senior member of staf f available; the response to an escape in all situations ; for example, whether daytime staff are on duty, whether visitors are presen t, and whether more than one animal has escaped; what needs to be done in the event of an es cape; including recapturing the animal, protecting visitors, alerting the police and, where necessary, the licensing authority. the control of visitors, including reassur ance, ushering into buildings, closing doors and windows, evacuating the zoo; the security of the perimeter barrier, involving the closure of all points of access to, and exit from, the zoo; the provision of fire-arms and darting equi pment to tranquillise or kill escaped animals, precise details of which to be discussed and agreed by the zoo operator and the local police; the provision of adequate equipm ent for members of any re capture party, including, where necessary, vehicle protection. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 8.35 A member of staff should be readily available at all times to take decisions regarding euthanasia of escaped animals. 8.36 The zoo must establish a clear chain of responsibility, which must be written and up to date. It must be notifi ed to all staff, and posted on notice-boards in staff areas. 8.37 The zoo must be responsible for the sele ction of the appropriate fire-arm or darting equipment to deal with escaped animals. 8.38 Zoo operators must ensure that all members of sta ff are familiar with emergency procedures when animals escape. In particula r, emergency drills must be carried out at least four times a year, recorded and regularly reviewed. 8.39 All escapes must be recorded and detail ed reports made. Risk assessments must be continually reviewed in the light of experience. The standard discretionary licence condition 4 in Defra Circular 02/2003 Anne x C which the Assembly adopts for theses purposes requires notification to the local author ity as soon as possible, and, in any case, not later than 24 hours following escape from t he confines of the z oo of any non-domestic animal. 8.40 Zoos must consider the potential risks of releasing parasites, diseases or non-native plants and animals through effluent water an d other routes. Waste water should be appropriately treated to ensure t hat this does not occur. Exits 8.41 Exits should be suitabl y located and adequately signed. 8.42 Each exit must be kept clear and be capable of being easily opened from inside to allow the release of visitors fr om the zoo. All such gates s hould be capable of being closed and secured to prevent the escape of animals. Signs 8.43 Suitable and, where appropr iate multi-lingual, warnings and information should be provided where animals and visitors may come into contact. 8.44 An adequate number of safety signs (in accordance with Brit ish Standard BS 5378 and, where appropriate, the Health and Safety (Safety Signs and Signals) Regulations 1996), giving warning of the hazard either by symbol or a combination of symbol and words, should be provided on any necessary electrified fence. 8.45 Warning should be given of all edges wher e a person might fall. Such edges must be guarded by a barrier capable of pr eventing children from falling. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 8.46 Any buildings where a hazar d exists should be kept locked. Warning notices should be displayed to indicate that access is either unsafe or not permitted. 8.47 Other areas should be clear ly defined, e.g. by means of barriers and warning notices; or, where access is allowed to vehicles op erated by zoo staff, by notices and road markings. 8.48 Zoos should consider the use of symbol- based signs wherever practicable to assist, for example, foreign visitors and children. 8.49 Safety signs on any electrified section of perimeter fence should face both outwards and inwards. 8.50 An adequate number of clearly visible safe ty signs, providing warning by means of a symbol, words, or a combi nation of symbol and words, should be displayed at each enclosure containing any species of hazardous animal which is likely to cause injury. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 9. Stock Records 9.1 Records must be kept and maintained of all individually re cognisable animals and groups of animals in the zoo. Where possible, animals should be individually identifiable. 9.2 The records must be kept either on a card index or computer, or other type of retrieval system from which information can be quickly examined. 9.3 Records must be kept up to date and be av ailable on site for six years. Provision should be made for long-term archiving in a secure format. 9.4 The records must provi de the following information: a) identification and scientific name; b) origin (i.e. whether wild or captive-born, including iden tification of parents, where known, and previous location/s, if any); c) dates of entry into, and disposal from, the collection and to whom; d) date, or estimated date, of birth or hatching; e) sex (where known); f) any distinctive markings, including ta ttoos, freeze-brands, rings or microchips; g) clinical data, including details of and dates of any treatment given; h) behavioural and life history data; i) date of death and the re sult of any post-mortem examination and laboratory investigations; j) where an escape has taken place, or damage or injury has been caused to, or by, an animal to persons or property, the reason for such escape, damage or injury must be recorded and a summary of remedial m easures taken to prevent recurrence should be provided; k) food and diets. 9.5 In addition to the individual records, an a nnual stocklist of all animals must be kept. A copy must be forwarded to the lo cal authority no later than 1 Apr il of the year following that to which it relates. The sto cklist must include the following: a) common and scientific names of the species; b) total in the collection at 1 January; c) number of arrivals into the collect ion from all sources during the year; Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. d) number of births or hatchings within the co llection during the year; e) number which died within 30 days of birth/hatching; f) number which died at other times, including culls; g) number that departed the collection, including sales, breeding loans, etc.; h) total remaining in the collection at 31 December; i) the sex of each animal, where known, mu st be recorded - e.g. 1.2.3 indicates one male, two females and three unsexed; j) the records should be set out in column s for ease of compilation and reference, e.g.: Common Name Scientific Name Group at 1.1.2004 Arrive Born Death within 30 days of birth Death Depart Group at Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 10. Staff and Training (See also Appendix 9 - Staff & Staff Training) 10.1 Number of staff and t heir experience and training mu st be sufficient to ensure compliance with the Standards at all times, taking due allowance for holidays, sickness and other absences. 10.2 A list must be maintained of all staff authorised to work with the animals, together with lines of responsibility and levels of expertise, training, and qualifications. 10.3 A suitably competent member of staff must always be available and in charge. 10.4 All animal staff must be co mpetent for their individual responsibilities and given the opportunity to undergo formal training to achieve appropriate qualifications. 10.5 Continuous in-house staff training must be a regular aspect of the zoo. 10.6 The zoo operator must make every effort to ensure that his/her staff do not have any convictions under the Zoo Licensing Act 1981 or a background of t he ill-treatment of animals under any other animal welf are or conservation legislation. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 11. Public Facilities First-Aid 11.1 First-aid equipment must be r eadily accessible on the premises. 11.2 First aid points must be adequately signed. 11.3 An adequate number of sta ff trained in first-aid must be available during the zoo's normal operating hours 11.4 Written instructions must be provided for staff in the provision of health care and the procedures to be followed in t he event of an incident involvin g any venomous animal and a visitor or staff member. 11.5 These instructions must include i mmediate action to be taken and required information on a pre-prepared form for forwar ding to the local hospital which would include: the nature of the bi te or sting and the species inflicting it; the specification, for cross-refere nce purposes, of the anti-venom which accompanies the patient; the telephone number of the nearest poisons centre (usually London or Liverpool); the telephone number of the zoo and of an appropriate senior staff member; the telephone number of the appropriate specialist that must be contacted; where applicable, the medical reco rds of the mem ber of staff; details of the vet or any staff in volved in handling venomous species. (See Appendix 8.3 - Venomous species) Toilets 11.6 Adequate, properly equipped and maintai ned toilet facilities must be provided. 11.7 Clean water for washing must be provided along with soap and means of drying hands. Parking 11.8 Zoo operators must ensure, in liaison wit h the Local Authority and the police where necessary, that parking facilities are sufficient to meet the anticipated needs of visitors to the zoo. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. Provisions For Particular Needs 11.9 Suitable shelter and seats should be provi ded for use, in particular, by elderly people and parents with young children. 11.10 Arrangements should be made to meet the reasonable needs of special-needs visitors, including persons with disabilities (a lthough inspectors are not expected to be fully familiar with, or to evaluate compliance wi th, disability discrimi nation legislation).

Display of Zoo Licence 12.1 The current licence or a copy and any attendant conditions issued under the Act, must be displayed at each publ ic entrance of the zoo. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. Appendix 1- The EC Zoos Directive 1.1 Council Directive 1999/22/EC relating to t he keeping of wild animals in zoos was given force of law in 2003 by the countries of t he United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). By way of background, the Directive required Member States to license and inspect zoos to ensure good standards of animal care, and set the framework for the participation of zoos in conservation and education. 1.2 The Directive required Member States to ensure that all zoos: 'participate in research from which c onservation benefits accrue to the species, and/or training in relevant conservation skills, and/or the exchange of information relating to species conservation and/or , where appropriate, captive breeding, repopulation or reintroduction of species into the wild;' 'promote public education and awareness in relation to the conservation of biodiversity, particularly by providing information about the species exhibited and their natural habitats;' 'accommodate their animals under conditions which aim to satisfy the biological and conservation requirements of the individual species, inter alia, by providing species specific enrichment of t he enclosures; and maintaining a high standard of animal husbandry with a developed programme of prev entive and curative veterinary care and nutrition;' 'prevent the escape of animals in order to avoid possible ecological threats to indigenous species and pr eventing intrusion of outside pests and vermin;' 'keep up-to-date records of the zoo's collection appropriate to the species recorded.' 1.3 Prior to the implementat ion of the Directive, Britain had had a zoo licensing system for two decades and with it an established system of licensing and inspection backed up by the Standards of Modern Zoo Practice (made under section 9 of the Zoo Licensing Act 1981). This regime already addressed many of the requirements of t he Directive, primarily those relating to animal welfar e, preventing escapes and reco rd-keeping (the third, fourth and fifth bullet points above). Guidance is provided on all these elements in these Standards. Implementation of t he Directive has involved some changes to the British legislation, particularly to introduce the new conservation and education requirements (the first and second bullet points above) and the adv ent of the 'pre-licensing' inspections. Closure of Zoos 1.4 One significant addition to the regulator y regime that stemme d from the EC Zoos Directive is the provisions for the closure of a zoo. Whilst revocation of a licence is no longer an option under the new legislation, this now provides for partial or full closure in the case of breach of conditions, and for the closure of an unlicensed zoo. 1.5 Another significant innovat ion that has come from the Dir ective is that the licensing authority is now required to approve any arrangem ents made for the welfar e or disposal of animals following the closure of a zoo.

Pre Inspection Audit. Appendix 2 - Ethical Review Process 2.1 There is an increasing tendency towards committees or groups of people serving as 'review' and 'audit' bodies on ethical issues . Zoos should be aware of the importance of ethics and have their own policy for dealing with ethical issues. 2.2 A large body of knowledge has been built up relating to ethics a nd review committees. Much of this stems from human medicine circles, where ethical review is a pre-requisite for most clinical studies, and the scientific res earch community, where ethical evaluation of projects involving animals is the norm. Establishments licens ed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (ASPA) were r equired to have an ethical review process in place from 1 April 1999. 2.3 Zoos can benefit from independent assessmen t. In some cases, there is merit in having a committee that looks at all ethical issues, both human and animals. These should include, for example, matters such as whether zoo staff should be required to be routinely vaccinated to prevent zoonotic transmission of contagious diseases, or to evaluate facilities for people with disabilities. 2.4 Zoos should have some form of ethical review process, particularly in situations where the use of animals (e.g. acquisition, management or disposal for conservation, education or research) may be in conflict with the best welfare interests of the animal or animals involved. Other issues that might be addressed include: In what circumstances an animal should be euthanased; whether waterfowl in enc losures should be procedures; transfer policy; culling policy; research projects; compliance with conservation and educational policies. 2.5 A large zoo should consider the establishment of its ow n ethics committee, but this may not be practicable for smaller establis hments. They may instead opt for access to ethical advice from another committee or indivi duals. In some cases an ethics adviser may be appropriate. Guidance on this is given in the Zoos Forum Handbook. 2.6 Whatever choice is made, t he following points are important:- the committee must not be perceived as merely an agent of the management: it should have independence and, at the very least, provide advice to the zoo operator; the committee should not consist only of scientists -although they may be able to advise on practicalities and research, they are not necessarily qualified to judge what is ethically acceptable. Where possible, junior st aff from the zoo and member s of the local community should be represented on the committee. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. the committee's work should be carried out in as open a way as possible, bearing in mind the need, on occasions, to respect confidentiality. the committee itself should be subject to review, with formal arrangements for changes to membership, rotation of c hairman, and co-option of persons with particular skills. 2.7 The question of ethical review is one that is likely to confront zoos more and more frequently in the coming years. However, zoos of the future will be better able to justify their existence and the work they do if they have a system in place that permits their activities to be scrutinised independently and impartially. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. Appendix 3 - Conservation And Education Measures 3.1 Inspectors should assess conservation (including research, if undertaken) and educational standards and advise on performanc e against them. The Conservation, Education and Research chapter of the Zoos Forum Handbook provides detailed further advice. Conservation 3.2 Chapter 7 sets out the st atutory conservation and educati on requirements of the Zoos Directive. There are a series of potential options given for conservation measures: participating in research from which c onservation benefits accrue to the species, and/or; training in relevant conservation skills, and/or; the exchange of information relati ng to species conservation and/or; where appropriate, captive br eeding, repopulation or reintr oduction of species into the wild. 3.3 There are a number of options for conser vation measures. Inspectors, zoos and local authorities should be familiar with the Zoo Forum Handbook Chapter on Conservation, Education and Research which provides detaile d guidance on the types of measures that can be taken to comply with t he Directive's requirements. 3.4 Many modern zoos carry out research. Participating in research from which conservation benefits accrue is one of the options to meet the Directive's requirements. 3.5 Participating in research should be withi n the scope of any collection. At the minimum this need constitute no more than collect ing and collating information for statistical purposes. Record keeping should therefor e be comprehensive and carried out in a systematic way. Where possible, zoos should use standard protocols for data collection to enable analysis. Data collection will usually be carried out by z oo staff, but there may be scope to involve volunteers, research work ers or students. Data on specimens can be made available to outside projects. 3.6 Most zoo based research causes no harm to the animals involved, forms part of the routine management and requires no intervention with the animals in order to collect data. However, even apparently harmless research (e .g. dietary manipulation, blood sampling) requires careful thought and planning and s hould be subject to independent assessment. (see Appendix 2 Ethical review process) 3.7 The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Ac t 1986 (ASPA) specifie s that a regulated procedure (i.e. one required to be carried out under licence), is \"any experimental or other scientific procedure... which may have the effe ct of causing the animal pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm.\" The performance of such research requires licensing of the project and the person carrying out the work and is subject to periodic visits to the establishment by an approved National Assembly for Wales inspector. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 3.8 Few zoos in the UK carry out research covered by the ASPA. But because the 1986 Act is very broad in its scope, zoos should be aware that even relatively harmless studies on animals might be subject to such contro ls. Visiting scientists need to be advised about the legislation before embarking on research work. If th ere is any doubt the zoo operator should consult the Assembly. 3.9 Research is of very limited value if t he results are not made available to others, especially where they can help to influence the welfare, health or conservation of animals. Data needs, as the very least, to be readily available on request; preferably it should also be published. 3.10 Zoos should be encouraged to evaluate the effectiveness of their research. Further guidance on research can be found in the Zoos Forum Handbook Chapter on Conservation, Education and Research. 3.11 There are many ways in wh ich zoos can directly support field conservation projects, including through financial contributions. Ho wever, simply seeking donations towards conservation projects, e.g. thr ough collection boxes, will not in itself be sufficient to meet the requirements of the legislation. Education 3.12 The Zoos Directive requires zoos to promote public education and awareness in relation to the conservation of biodiversity, particularly by providing information about the species exhibited and their natural habitats. Inspectors, zoos and local authorities should be familiar with the Zoo Forum Handbook C hapter on Conservation, Education and Research which provides detailed guidance on the types of measures that can be taken to comply with the Directive's requirements. 3.13 A modern zoo must contribute in as m any ways as possible to the education of visitors. They can, for example, use graphi cs and other devices to provide information and raise awareness. 3.14 Inspectors, zoos and local authorities should be familiar with the education standards expected in member zoos of the British and Irish Associ ation of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA, formerly called the Federation of Zool ogical Gardens of Great Britain and Ireland prior to a name change in late 2004). 3.15 In addition to written education plans, points to consider include: That zoo education is broader than in sc hools and should be targeted at all visitors; Educational material should, where po ssible, be linked to National Curricula; Methods of interpretation for visitors to the zoo should include signs, graphics, activities, interactive displays and demonstrations; Zoos should be encouraged to parti cipate in zoo education networks. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. Appendix 4 - Animal Transactions (see also Appendix 2 - Et hical Review Process) 4.1 The Animal Transaction Policy of BIAZA (formerly called the Federation of Zoos) should be complied with where appropriate. Transport of Live Animals 4.2 Arrangements for transport must comply with the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997; the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES); and the Guidelines on Transport and t he Regulations of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and any other relevant regulations. Animal Acquisition 4.3 In general, the acquisition of animals fr om the wild is to be discouraged unless there are justifiable reasons for doing so. If this option is necessary, an ethics and conservation policy should take into account: the legality of the acquisition; the need for so doing; the collection methods, including ensuring t hat they are environmentally acceptable and safeguard the welf are of the animal. 4.4 When receiving animals, co llections should be capable of providing appropriate levels of husbandry based on the Five Principles. Disposal of Live Animals 4.5 Surplus stock is any individual that a collection no longer wishes to house, for any reason. When disposing of such stock operator s should ensure that it is only passed to persons with the appropriate facilities, resour ces and expertise conforming with the Five Principles. Precautions should also be tak en to ensure that reci pients are likely to safeguard the animal's welfare in any subsequent transactions. 4.6 If animals bred in zoos are sold as pets to the general public, a licence may be required from the local authorit y under the Pet Animals Act 1951. Animals intended for release 4.7 The guidelines of the Reintroduction Sp ecialist Group of the Species Survival Commission of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) should be followed when considering or undertaking the release of animals into the wild. Consideration should also Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. be given to using other recognised guidelines such as those of the British Wildlife Rehabilitation Council. 4.8 Animals intended for releas e present special challenges in comparison with those staying in the zoo. For example, health care may need to be different and exposure to stressors may be necessary, as care and facilities in recipient country may fall below the standard in the UK. Zoos involved in release programmes should make every effort to conform as closely as possible to the IUCN standards and reconcile t hese as far as possible with the legitimate needs of the project. Particular attention should be paid to t he suitability of any tem porary care facilities. Euthanasia 4.9 Euthanasia is an acceptable procedure only if an animal cannot be provided with captive conditions which meet the Five Princi ples, or it cannot be released into the wild. Although breeding for conservation purposes is to be encouraged, species for which there is marginal or no conservation value shoul d be carefully assessed on whether to allow them to breed, and, if not, appropriate acti on taken to prevent stock from increasing unnecessarily. In the main, measures should be taken to control unwanted or unnecessary breeding. These are preferable to euthanasia of healthy stock. 4.10 Euthanasia is justifiable under certai n conditions, which include the following: If, in the opinion of a vet, an animal is su ffering from an incurable disease, or severe pain or suffering which cannot be alleviated. If a zoo has to close, euthanasia may be the only option for so me animals and the most humane for others. If the animal poses a serious and unavoidable threat to human safety (e.g. because it has escaped). Culling of surplus stock (including una cceptable sex ratios) where over-crowding compromises the welfare of the animals so t hat it is impractical to maintain them within the Five Principles. 4.11 It is important that a modern zoo has a policy, with appr opriate protocols, to ensure humane and timely euthanasia to minimi se suffering. This information should be made available to Inspectors and form part of the audit process. It should be capable of demonstrating t hat zoo operators have: a) information and guidance from their veterinary surgeon on euthanasia, including emergency methods; b) facilities for the humane despatch of animals of all the species kept, including for killing casualties unde r emergency conditions c) support and advice on public relations aspects of the killing of animals. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. Appendix 5 - Veterinary Facilities Veterinary services 5.1 The EC Zoos Directive requires zoos to have '....a developed programme of preventive and curative vete rinary care and nutrition'. 5.2 In assessing the level of veterinary serv ices needed, the over-rid ing factor must be animal health and welfare. The consulting vete rinary surgeon will often be in the best position to assess the requirement, but it is important that operat ors have access to and make use of the best veterinary knowledge. Spec ial-interest veterinary associations exist and may be able to provide help in locating specialist advice. 5.3 Continuing Professional De velopment (CPD) is now av ailable, for example the Certificate and Diploma in Zoological Medi cine, with specialisms in zoo and wildlife medicine, and in fish health and production. It is essential that zoo veterinarians make every effort to be up-to-date and to participate, when possible, in furthe r formal training. It is also important that full advantage is taken of the availability of other specialists, such as those with expertise in veterinary derma tology, ophthalmology, cardiology, and human medicine. 5.4 In order to provide comprehensive veteri nary care, a zoo may choose to use a local veterinary surgeon for basic cover, supported by a specialist, or a specialist supported by a local veterinary practice. In both case s, adequate provision must be made for early contact and discussion when needed. 5.5 The level of veterinary service should be appropriate to the size and type of the collection. Over and above emergency calls, t here should be sufficiently frequent regular advisory visits to assess general health and pr eventative veterinary practices. A minimum recommended frequency for different types of collections is as follows:- a) Large zoos - weekly. b) Medium sized zoos - 2 weekly. c) Large bird parks - monthly. d) Large aquaria, small bird parks - 2 monthly e) Medium sized aquaria (especially with ot her animals), specialist reptile exhibits, small and mixed zoos - 3 monthly. f) Small aquaria, butterfly houses, small par ks aviaries, museum-type vivaria, small falconry centres - 6 monthly. 5.6 It may be feasible to extend an emergency vi sit into a regular visit provided that it occurs at an appropriate interval from the previous regular visit. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 5.7 Definitions of the different type of zoos are difficult to arrive at, and it is at the inspector's discretion to decide into which category any particular zoo should fall. On-site Facilities 5.8 Adequate facilities should be available at the zoo for routine or emergency examination of animals. Where these are basic, specialised c linical facilities should be available within a reasonable distance. There must be adherenc e to both legal standards and codes of practice relating to radiography, storage and use of drugs and firearms. 5.9 Where a full veterinary service is not ava ilable at the zoo, a dedicated treatment room should be provided at the premises and be avail able at all times for use for the routine examination of animals. There should be minimu m facilities of an examination table, hot and cold running water, heating, ventilation, lighting and power. The room should be of sufficient size for the purpose, have washable floor and wall surfaces, and be maintained in a clean condition with adequate drainage. 5.10 Facilities should be available for the is olation and treatment of aquatic animals where these form part of the zoo collection. These should incl ude separate holding tanks of appropriate dimensions to cope with the full range of species within the collection and the different water types (temperate, tropical, freshwater and seaw ater). Systems of catching up and moving sick fishes to the treatment facilit y should be in place, particularly for large fishes. Treatment tanks should be isolated from other water system s within the zoo or aquarium. 5.11 Facilities should be available for collecting, restraining, treating and, if necessary, for administering a general anaesthetic, for euthanasia and for the after-care of all species kept at the zoo. These shoul d be made available to the ve terinary surgeon within a period which minimises unnecessary suffering to sick animals. 5.12 Where a full-time resident veterinary service is located at the zoo, the facilities must be adequately equipped for the re asonable and foreseeable ve terinary needs of the collection. 5.13 All animal drugs, vaccines and other veterinary products should be kept safely under lock and key with access by authorised persons onl y. Regular inspection by the veterinary surgeon to remove out-of-date drugs should be carried out. Full records of drug stock, usage and disposal should be kept. 5.14 Medicinal products should only be administered under t he direction and control of a veterinary surgeon. 5.15 All unwanted or contaminat ed veterinary equipment must be disposed of safely. For example equipment should not be left in plac es where it could be reached by any animal and sharp instruments such as syringes and needl es should be disposed of as specified in current legislation e.g. in rigid containers or incinerated after use. Post-mortem Facilities Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 5.16 Normally animal carcasses should be quickl y and safely removed to a professional veterinary laboratory. Where th is is not possible, facilities should be provided for conducting post-mortem examinations and proc essing resulting samples in a safe and hygienic manner. If immediat e post-mortem exam inations are not possible, then in consultation with the veterinary surgeon, re frigerated facilities for storage need to be provided pending removal in a suitable insula ted container to a po st-mortem laboratory. Specimens should not be frozen unless specific ally requested by the veterinary surgeon. In the case of animals which rapidly degener ate e.g. fish, where rapid diagnosis is essential, it is acceptable for post mortems to be carried out on site by suitably trained non-veterinary staff (but see 5.17 and 8.5.4) 5.17 Facilities provided on the premises for post-mortem examinations should be suitably equipped for the species in the collection. 5.18 Following post-mortem examinations c onducted on the zoo premises, carcasses and organs should be disposed of swiftly and in accordance with the Animals By-Products Regulations 2003. 5.19 Whenever possible, carcasses of interest ing animals or important species should be offered to a recognised scientific institution. Museums in particular will often welcome such material and make it available for study, thus extending the scientific and educational role of the specimen. Sometimes there is a conf lict between the requireme nts of the museum and the need for a full post-mortem examination of the animal. In such cases a careful decision has to be made as to which takes prio rity. Post-mortem techniques that minimise damage to the carcass have been devised and c an often be used in such circumstances. 5.20 Museums usually require skins but not soft tissue. Zoos should be aware of this and endeavour to retain soft tissue for pathological examination or deposit in a reference collection. Appendix 6 - Animal Contact Areas Introduction 6.1 There are advantages and disadvantages in hav ing animal contacts areas, both for the public and animals. The benefits include: the public may gain a better understanding and awareness of the species by being in closer contact and not having to view the animals in a conventional caged environment. As a result, the public's ap preciation of the zoo and its educational value may be enhanced; controlled handling of suitabl e animals can be an important learning experience e.g. what does a snake feel like? the animals may be allowed into larger and more complex areas than would be possible in the more c onventional cage/enclosure; the presence of the public may prove an enriching experience for the animals. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 6.2 However, direct contact may present danger s to the public and cause stress or injury to the animals. The purpose of this appendix is to provide guidance so that the optimum environment and experience is encouraged, both for the animals and the public. 6.3 All situations where the public and animals are in direct physical contact should be subject to regular risk assessm ent before the activity comm ences, and kept under review. Where the risk assessment indica tes that controls are required to reduce the risk, then steps will need to be taken to tighten controls (see the Health & Safety Executive Code Of Practice on Zoos). General provisions 6.4 Zoo operators should exercise caution and discretion in the removal of even non- hazardous animals from enclosures, since the behaviour of all animals is less predictable when away from their usual environment. 6.5 All walk through exhibits, whether for hazardous or non-hazardous species, should have clearly delineated areas di stinguishing public areas from those for the animals. There should be appropriate signs, super vision and barriers to ensure that the public do not enter the animal only areas. 6.6 Particular care should be taken to avoid injury to visitors when animals are used for rides. 6.7 Hazardous animals should not be allowed out of their usual enclosures for the purpose of direct contact with the public, except wher e the zoo operator is satisfied that such animals are not, when under control, likely to caus e injury or transmit disease. This should be judged on a case-by-case basis once an adequate risk assessment has been carried out, and procedures developed to control risks to visitors and animals to an acceptable level. 6.8 Where hazardous animals are allowed out of their usual enc losures, or the public into their enclosures, an appropriate number of au thorised and experienced members of staff must accompany the animal or animals. (see Appendix 12 Hazardous Animal Categorisation) 6.9 The zoo must have adequate hand-washing and sanitising facilities, close to the contact point and obviously signposted. Thes e should provide with running water, soap and disposable towels or hot air blowers. 6.10 Supervisors should ensure that, following contact with animals, children wash their hands. Prominent signs should remind paren ts or accompanying adults of this. 6.11 There must be adequate staff supervision in all contact areas. This should be commensurate with the type of animal and degree of risk, and to ensure the welfare of the animal. At all times whilst the public have a ccess to the contact area there must be an appropriate number of staff on hand to ensure the welf are of the animals is not compromised by excessive handling. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 6.12 If children are in contac t with, or feeding animals, prom inent signs must warn them not to place their faces against the animals, nor to put their hands in their own mouths afterwards. 6.13 Signs should be displayed prohibiting t he public from taking any unauthorised food into animal-contact areas and warning of the risks of animal bites. Walk-through exhibits 6.14 In walk-through exhibits with exotic herbi vores/primates, the following points should be noted: Animals should be regularly and thor oughly screened for any zoonotic diseases, with particular reference to viruses in primates; Public entry should be controlled in groups; Number of group visits per day should be limited; When more than five people are admitted at one time, st aff must ensure that the public are counted in and out; Staff to visito r ratios should be adequate. St aff members should carry an appropriate implement for possible defence of the public, and a radio linked to a control point. The public must be informed as to what is unacceptable behaviour; Where appropriate, facilities must be pr ovided for secure storage of possessions; Feeding of animals by visitors should not be permitted, exce pt where strictly controlled by staff; The public should not be eating or carrying food; Members of the public who may have eaten recently should be requested to wash their hands; Flash photography should be controlled; Trained first aiders should be available; Parties should be asked to consider any health problems they have which may be transmittable to the animals. Diving experience exhibits 6.15 It has become commonplace for the larger public aquaria to allow sports and hobby divers to dive in shark tanks. 6.16 If this practice is permitted, it must be s ubject to the same provis ions that are applied to other animal-contact situations and in parti cular to walk-through exhibits with hazardous species. 6.17 Encouragement should be given to r ead the guidelines being prepared by the Aquarium Divers Association once completed. Touch-pools 6.18 Point to note on touch pool exhibits are: Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. a) Touch pools that permit direct-acce ss should be continually supervised; b) If supervision by a staff member is not continuous, the exhibit must be designed so that the depth and breadth of t he exhibit make it impossible for the public to reach the animals, or there should be protection by a barrier or cover; c) Animals used in touch-pools must be rota ted throughout the day to allow animals a quiet period to minimise stress; d) Staff must be properly tr ained in the handling and care of the species held and the management of visitors around the touch pool; e) There must be continual asse ssment of the protocols used; f) There must be an adequate educ ational contribution from the experience to justify it; g) Specific records must be kept of animal use, illness and deaths. h) Aquatic invertebrates should not normally be taken out of the water; i) Removal of stings from rays to make them safe for display in open touch pool type exhibits should not be permitted. Drive-through enclosures 6.19 Where dangerous animals are k ept in drive-through enclosures, entry and exit to the enclosures should be through a system of doubl e gates, with sufficient space between to allow the gates to be securely closed to the front and rear of any vehicle which may enter the enclosures. 6.20 In the case of dangerous carnivores, the access gates should be protected by fencing positioned at right angles to the perimeter fence on each side of the roadway within the enclosure, be of the same standard as that fo r the main enclosure barrier and extending back from the access for a distance of at least 25 metres. 6.21 Double gates should be designed and mainta ined so that, where hazardous animals are within or have access to the enclosure secured by the gates, one gate cannot be opened until the other has been securely closed. Provided no danger to the public is thereby caused, provision may be made for this arrangement to be overridden in the event of an emergency. 6.22 For other hazardous animals (except thos e grazing or hoofed animals where a cattle grid would be sufficient to contain them) si ngle entry and exit gates, supervised at all times, should be provided. 6.23 Access points between enclosures should be controlled to prevent animals entering from adjoining enclosures. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 6.24 Electronic pressure pads, where used, should be designed and installed to ensure that in the event of their failu re, any gate they control will close automatically or otherwise operate to ensure that animals are safe ly secured within their enclosures. 6.25 Gates which are mechanically operated s hould have an alternative method of control so they can be opened and closed manually in the event of an interruption of the power s upply or other emergency, or should be designed to close automatically when subject to power failure. 6.26 Operators of mechanically -operated gates should have a clear, unobstructed view of the gates under their control and of the area in the vicinity of those gates. 6.27 A one-way road system should be used to assi st the traffic flow and thus reduce the risk of accidents. Stopping should only be permi tted at places where the road is at two vehicles wide. 6.28 Where dangerous carnivores and primates and any other hazardous wild animal are kept: a) Access to vehicles without a solid roof should be prohibited. b) No vehicle should be allowed access unl ess a rescue vehicle capable of effecting its recovery is immediately available; and c) Notices, which are readi ly visible and easy to read, should be displayed to warn visitors whilst in the enclosure to : - stay in the vehicle at all times; - keep all doors locked; - keep windows and sun-roof closed; - sound the horn or flash the headlights and await the arrival of a rescue vehicle if their vehicle breaks down. 6.29 Continuous observation by trained staff shoul d be maintained over the entire area of each enclosure containing any hazardous anim al. Staff working in emergency vehicles, gate control and observation towers and elsew here within the enclosure should keep in touch by electronic means. A back-up system (u sing, where appropriate, whistles, horns or flags) should be rehearsed and be ready for si tuations when equipm ent is inoperative. 6.30 The supervising staff member should be armed with an appropriate firearm, and be trained in its use so that a hazardous animal c an be killed in an emergency if this will save human life or injury. He or she should be author ised to act in the event of an emergency. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. Appendix 7 - Training Of Animals General Provision 7.1 There are three main reasons why animals are trained in zoos: To assist in their captive management, su ch as compliance with routine husbandry; To improve their welfare, for example, by training to facilitate routine veterinary procedures to be carried out wit hout the need for an anaesthetic; and To participate in educational talks and demonstrations. 7.2 The objective of training must alwa ys be clearly defined in the context of: Animal welfare Keeper safety Public safety 7.3 All training programmes should provid e a net welfare benefit to the animal. 7.4 Training methods should be based on po sitive reinforcement. Where negative reinforcement is used, it must never comp romise the welfare of the animal. Written protocols should be established in zoologic al collections, which clarify approved, and where appropriate non-appr oved, training methods. 7.5 When animals are being trained there shoul d be adequate facilities to separate them from groups to off-show, non-public areas. 7.6 Records must be kept and made available fo r inspection of all abnormal, unpredictable or otherwise significant behavioural irregularitie s for each animal at each training session and each demonstration. 7.7 Where public educational de monstrations are carried out, all trainers and the person responsible for exhibiting t he demonstration must be regist ered under the Performing Animals (Regulation) Act 1925. This is not nece ssary if training procedures are limited to animal handling and veterinary tasks. 7.8 There must be adequate supervision of trai ning and display by a senior member of staff with specific responsibility for doing so. Use of animals in demonstrations outside the zoo 7.9 Section 22. (2) of the Act states 'For the purpose of the said Act an animal shall be...treated as kept in a zoo when it is el sewhere in the personal possession of the operator of the zoo, or of competent pers ons acting on his behalf.' Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 7.10 Although interpretation of the legislation is a matter for the Courts, it is generally held as exempting a zoo from t he requirements of the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976 (and thus the need to apply for permission from local authorities to bring the animal into their area) when animals are taken, for example, to film studios. 7.11 Zoos must ensure that they have a ce rtificate issued under Article 10 of Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 for Annex A CITES s pecimens that are to be used or displayed commercially. However an Article 10 certificate is not required if a zoo has a separate certificate issued under Article 30 of Commissi on Regulation (EC) No 1808/01. Article 30 certificates enables all zoo ani mals to be used or displayed commercially where they are being primarily used for breeding or research and educational purposes of benefit to the conservation of the species. A separate Articl e 10 certificate is requi red if the zoo intends to sell any Annex A specimens other than to a zoo issued with an Article 30 certificate. 7.12 Zoo operators who take animals to other locations for commercial or other purposes must make it clear to the other individuals or organisati ons concerned the circumstances under which the animals are provided and may be used. This must accord with the zoo's policy statement on such arrangements. 7.13 This policy statement s hould clearly set out that: The health and welfare of the animals will not be prejudiced; That accommodation is adequate for the species and commensurate with the time to be spent away from normal accommodation. 7.14 The user organisation should clearly under stand that the designa ted member of the zoo's staff accompanying the animals (or such other person as the zoo may designate) will have the absolute right to say for how l ong and for what purposes the animals may be used. 7.15 Whilst the comments regarding direct contact between public and animals made earlier may well apply, the operator should ensu re that appropriate gui delines for the use of animals are followed. For example, t he Animal Filming & Training Commission (AFTC) guidelines are well accepted within the industry and should serve as an acceptable Standard. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. Appendix 8 - Specialist Exhibits 8.1 The Act applies to all wild animals kept in zoos. These Standards therefore apply to species that may have very differ ent environmental requirements. 8.2 Whilst basic rules apply to the management of all species - and the Five Principles are appropriate to all living animals - there is o ften a need for more specific guidelines when Inspectors are faced with less familiar animals. 8.3 The following guidance notes have therefore been drawn up. They should be read in conjunction with the appropria te management guidelines and ot her published data. At this stage only some specialist exhibits are covered; in the course of time there is likely to be further guidance. 8.4 Zoos and Inspectors are encouraged to make full use of the latest Taxon Advisory Group or BIAZA (formerly called the Federati on of Zoos) Guidelines and other sources when assessing exhibits. Zoos and experts in many parts of the world are developing guidelines and these should be referred to. (See Appendix 13 - Bibliography) 8.1 Invertebrates 8.1.1 While some collections contain only invertebr ates, more often they form part of larger zoos. However, many of the Standards that can r eadily be applied, or adapted, to other collections are of limited relevance to invertebrates. 8.1.2 Invertebrates should be ke pt within their preferred body temperature (PBT) range or allowed access to a temperat ure gradient. Where doubt exists , a choice of habitats, with different temperatures and relative humiditie s (and where appropriate different substrates) should be available. 8.1.3 Contact with potentially to xic chemicals must be avoided. These include insecticides, disinfectants and heavy metals (which can prove lethal to molluscs). 8.1.4 Water quality is important to many invertebrates - not only those that are totally aquatic but also those that liv e or breed in damp places and/ or require high levels of humidity. 8.1.5 Although, as with other species, hygie ne is important, care has to be taken to consider the requirements of different spec ies. Where this knowledge is not available within the collection, specialis t advice may need to be sought. 8.1.6 Health screening should be carried out upon arrival of new invertebrates into the collection, particularly for wild-caught stock. A quarantine area and/or is olation facilities are desirable. 8.1.7 Veterinary guidance on in vertebrates is developing apace. Methods of treating individual animals, especially arthropods, and diagnostic tests and disease prevention Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. measures for colony animals are more effect ive than previously. Personnel responsible for invertebrate collections should, therefore, view veterinary assistance as important in keeping animals healthy. Not all vete rinary surgeons are knowledgeable about invertebrates, however; specialised advice may be required. 8.1.8 The 'Notes for Inspectors' produced by BIAZA (formerly called the Federation of Zoos) should be available to operators of inve rtebrate collections. In addition to aiding inspections, these provide useful informati on about the care of these diverse animals. 8.2 Reptiles and Amphibians 8.2.1 Under prevailing climatic conditions in Britain, most species of non-native reptiles and amphibians require a controll ed environment for survival in captivity. Some of these environments may require water. Animals may be k ept in fully controlled vivaria, or in open enclosures inside a larger controlled climat e space. Some species may be comfortable outdoors during periods of good w eather. Controlled environments must provide all of the animal's needs for heat, humidity, light and p hotoperiod, air and water quality. Because of high environmental temperatures , attention to hygiene and disease control are especially important. Temperature 8.2.2 Vivaria must provide a thermal gradi ent around the preferred body temperature of the species of animal kept. Natural daily and seasonal variations should be provided. Heat sources must be designed and fitted to prevent injury to the animal. Sources must be thermostatically controlled or r egularly adjusted in response to a clearly visible monitoring system (thermometer, thermocouple etc.). In stallation of a constant readout system is encouraged, so that fluctuations can be recognised retrospectively. 8.2.3 For more tolerant animals, such as crocodilians, open enclosures in heated rooms are sufficient, provided the temperature can be m onitored at the animal's level. Safe local sources of more intense heat (heat pads , basking lamps) should be provided where appropriate for the species. Pools may need to be heated separately. The requirements for most reptiles are within t he range 20-35\u00baC however, most to rtoises and crocodilians need water temperatures in the range 26-32\u00baC. Humidity 8.2.4 Relative humidity (RH) is a function of temperature, moisture content of the air and ventilation. As temperature and moisture in the exhibit are usually fixed, control of humidity through altering ventilation is preferred, and should be possible. Hide structures can be used to provide local humid areas. Measurement of relative humidity should be continuous if possible, but daily readings are acceptable. RH range for most reptiles varies from 50- 80% depending on the natural habitat of the s pecies. The majority of amphibians require a higher range, typically 65-95%. Many features of the exhibi t may affect the RH, including pools, spraying and the presence of plants. Lighting Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 8.2.5 Lighting should be appropria te in strength, photoperiod and type for the species held. Ultraviolet (UV) light from full spectrum s ources is essential for many species when not available naturally. Most glazing materials do not transmit natural UV light. UV light sources have a limited life and must be replac ed regularly, and records kept. Generally, the local photoperiod should be fo llowed, unless there are spec ific species requirements, for example, for breeding. Air Quality 8.2.6 There should be sufficient ventilation to maintain air quality and RH in the exhibit without compromising temperature control. This is facilitated by keeping vivaria within suitably ventilated warm rooms. Water Quality 8.2.7 Pools large enough for full immersion are required by many rept iles and amphibians, and for reproduction in many species of amphibians. Water quality is normally maintained in smaller pools by regular replacement of the water and cleaning of the pool surface. Attention should be given to sudden temperat ure change and the risk of introducing toxic disinfectant residues during this procedure. Larger pools for semi or fully aquatic species should have water treatment facilities and qua lity should be monitored on a regular basis, as for aquaria. Fully aquatic species need suffi cient space for comfortable swimming and to allow sufficient exercise. Beaching areas should be provi ded where appropriate. Transmission of pathogens between exhibits vi a communal water systems and tools is a major risk, and should be avoided. Furniture And Substrates 8.2.8 For normal display purposes, naturalisti c exhibits should be used with substrates appropriate to the natural habita t of the species. As confinement increases pressure on substrates, they should be changed regularly and not allowed to become contaminated. Waste and uneaten food should be removed da ily. Basking and concealment sites and rough surfaces to aid sloughing should be prov ided. Climbing material should be provided for arboreal species. Where animals are kept outdoors, care should be taken to avoid the risk of flooding or of animals burrowing or climbing out. More natural planting and substrates are possible. Predat or and pest control are particu larly important under these circumstances. Space Requirements 8.2.9 General comments about the space needs of all animals apply to reptiles and amphibians. However, it must be remembered that many reptile s grow quickly in early life and often continuously thereafter, and so frequently outgrow their enclosures. If enclosures are not large enough to accommodat e the future growth of the species exhibited, there must be a clear plan for its future accommodation. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. Service Areas 8.2.10 Service passages should be large eno ugh for comfortable wo rking and handling of the animals. Access to enclosures should not be so awkward as to rest rict observation or cleaning. Service areas must be kept free of clutter particularly where venomous species are held (see Appendix 9.3). H andling and catching equipment should be readily available close to enclosures, and there should be handwashing facilities for staff. Feeding 8.2.11 Live feeding of vertebrat e prey is to be discouraged (see Standard 6). Where it has to be undertaken, feeding must be observed and live prey not left in the enclosure. Balanced diets which meet all the nutritional needs are essential, as for all species, and vitamin and/or mineral supplemen ts are also often necessary. Provision of drinking water may not be straightforward in some species. Cloud and rainforest reptiles may only drink from droplets on vegetation and desert species may lick surface condensation. Dechlorination of drinking wa ter may improve palatability. Records 8.2.12 Records must be kept of all individual animals. In addition to the normal information, these need to cover environmental param eters, feeding, sloughing and egg-laying. 8.3 Venomous Species 8.3.1 Zoos keeping venomous species of rept ile, amphibian, fish or invertebrates must ensure that sufficient trained staff for management are available at all times. 8.3.2 Venomous animals should be kept either in solid walled or roofed enclosures (with suitable means of ventilation) or in enclosu res where the walls are of adequate height and design to prevent non-flying animals from es caping or reaching staff or visitors. 8.3.3 Service areas for non-aquatic venom ous species should be secure with the equivalent of a lock-gate system. Service areas should be free of escape routes or places to hide, for example into cavity walls. 8.3.4 Tanks or vivaria cont aining venomous species shoul d be individually marked with warning signs in the service area. Vivari a must be kept individually locked and access available only to authorised persons. 8.3.5 Appropriate staff training must be giv en, and a written protocol made available on action to be taken in the case of escape or bites. Regular practices must be carried out and recorded, and audits of protocols conducted. 8.3.6 The appropriate up-to-dat e anti-venom must be held ei ther at the zoo, and should accompany a bitten or stung pati ent to hospital; or be held at the appropriate hospital. It Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. must be kept in strict accordance with the manuf acturer's instructions. The location of anti- venom and hospitals should be decided on the basis of specialist medical advice and recorded in a written risk assessment. 8.3.7 Local medical authorit ies should be made aware in advance of any zoo keeping venomous species. This should be regul arly updated by the zoo concerned. The appropriate medical aut horities should be consulted and made aware of the procedure to be followed by the zoo in the event of inci dents involving venomous bites and stings. A list of specialist help and contact details must be av ailable and readily accessible in case of an emergency. (see Appendix 12 - Hazardous Animal Categorisation) 8.4 Pinnipeds and marine birds 8.4.1 As with other aquatic s pecies, there can be difficulties in inspecting facilities for marine mammals and birds. These guidelines are intended to assist inspectors with limited marine mammal experience. Further referenc e may be made to the Penguin Husbandry Manual (American Zoo and Aquarium Associat ion, 1994). Cetaceans have not been kept in UK zoos or aquariums for some years. The key references are Klinowska and Brown's Review of Dolphinaria, (DoE, 1986) and DoE's subsequent Additional Guidelines on Cetaceans. It is likely that these would require review. Accommodation Space 8.4.2 Attention should be given to the adequate provision of both land and water space. In general more active species, such as sea lions, need more land space, but all groups are primarily aquatic and should be provided with the maximum possible water space. No specific provisions are needed for breeding, with the exception of nest holes for some penguins and ledges for seabirds, but the ri sk of drowning in young pinniped pups, particularly sealions and fur s eals (which cannot swim at bi rth), must be noted. Male pinnipeds tend to harass females after birth, and provision for separ ate accommodation for mother and pup is needed. The design of land space should avoid the loss of penguin eggs by immersion. Construction 8.4.3 Sea bird droppings are particularly des tructive and surfaces need to be highly resistant. All land areas should be designed to allow water and waste run off to drain without contaminating the pool, as far as prac ticable. Pool and land surfaces should have a durable, non-toxic, non-porous and waterproof finish, and should be coloured to reduce glare. In the case of pinnipeds, pool wa lls should be smooth to prevent injury. Land surfaces with sand, pebbles or vegetati on are acceptable, pr ovided cleansing and drainage are to an acceptable standard. Temperature, Light And Ventilation Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 8.4.4 Environmental temperatur es should be appropriate for t he species. Most species of marine mammals and seabirds can be comfortably kept in the UK, so long as shade is provided for exceptionally harsh or hot weat her. Antarctic ice-dwelling penguin species need year-round cooling and require specialised closed environment exhibits with low temperatures, filtered air and high ventilation ra tes. High reflective light levels in pinniped exhibitions should be avoided because of the risk of eye discomfort and disease. Water Management 8.4.5 The aim of water management is to pr ovide a safe and appropriate environment for the species, bearing in mind that the particular requirem ents for closed systems differ greatly from open water. Ma rine species produce large amounts of highly nitrogenous waste, which reacts with chemicals to pr oduce noxious byproducts and acts as an ideal substrate for micro-organisms. 8.4.6 Marine species are adapted to salt water and the provision of a salt water environment is beneficial. Baikal seals are adapted to fresh water. 8.4.7 Operators should set wr itten parameters for water qua lity using published guidelines and should make sufficient measurements and keep records to show that these are consistently met. Any chemicals used in th is process should be ca pable of being readily measured in water and should be non-toxic and non- irritant at concentrations applied. The safety of incoming water, where this is not from a mains source, should be regularly checked. If on-line monitoring of water paramet ers (such as salinity, pH, chlorine and temperature) are not incor porated in the system, measurem ents should, as a guide, be taken at the following frequencies: - temperature daily salinity daily chlorine etc 2 - 4 times daily pH 2 - 4 times daily ozone/redox continuous bacteria monthly 8.4.8 The inspectors should thoroughly inve stigate the training and level of understanding of water systems and their monitoring by zoo staff. 8.4.9 There should be clear precautions and inst ructions for protecting the animals, staff and the public in the event of fire. These ma y include electrical/water hazards, chemical leakage or overdosage, plant failure, fire an d water loss. Such precautions will generally include the facility to drain pools quickly, provide separate temporary accommodation for animals, and evacuation plans. Where separ ate pools are available for quarantine purposes, they must include a separate water system. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 8.4.10 The method of disposal of waste water from clos ed or fill-and-empty systems should be regularly examined as to environmental and public safety. Nutrition And Veterinary Care 8.4.11 Preparation and storage of food and the use of appropriate supplements to counteract nutritional inadequacy are particularly important in piscivorous species. If animals are scatter fed, the risks from deter iorating fish must be considered and uneaten food removed. Salt supplementation may be requi red if fresh water is used in pools. There should be adequate facilities for handling the ani mals safely should the need arise. This may involve training and use of physical rest raint devices. The restraint and anaesthetic requirements for marine mammals differ substant ially from those for terrestrial species. Preventive treatment against avian malaria is required for outdoor penguins in the summer. Public Safety 8.4.12 Marine mammals and penguins bite. All of them can reach much farther than it appears, and penguins, sealions and fur seals can climb and also leap from water. Barriers around pools and land areas should take this into account. Where visitor contact is possible with penguins outside their enc losures, there must be adequate staff supervision. (See Appendix 12 Hazardous Animal Categorisation) 8.5 Public Aquaria Water Quality 8.5.1 Although water quality require ments of different species va ry it is important that certain basic parameters are m onitored and recorded, and that due care is taken to cater for particular species requirements. 8.5.2 Water quality monitoring should be carried out as routine: for new exhibits or ones that have undergone major servicing, daily monitoring should include temperature, salinity (as ppt or as SG in salt water tanks), pH, total ammonia (to assess un-ionised ammonia), and nitrite; and, on a weekly basis, dissolved oxygen and nitrate. after a one month period , if a tank is stable, tests can be carried out weekly rather than daily at all times , there must be provision of suffici ent water treatment equipment to ensure the maintenance of water quality within set parameters to meet species specific requirements. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 8.5.3 Public aquaria should use professional standard water qualit y test kits. There should be some quality control of test procedures, ei ther by parallel samp ling or calibration against set standards. 8.5.4 Aquarists should have access to on-site laboratory facilities, such as basic microscopy, and be trained in sample collection. 8.5.5 Specific water quality tolerances and r equirements vary considerably, but typical maintenance ranges for wate r in the tank would be: Marine Freshwater Veterinary Surgeon 8.5.6 The veterinary surgeon should be familiar with current practice regarding veterinary care of fish, especially the species with which he or she is expected to deal. He or she should be responsible for, or acti vely involved in, the following: routine visits; (see appendix 5 - Veterinary Facilities) staff training in disease recognition and basic lab techniques; directing or carrying out treatment of sick animals; preparing a set of treatment protocols for aquarium tanks. Divers 8.5.7 Aquarium divers must operate to curr ent HSE Approved Codes of Practice. Divers must also receive training about the behaviour and requirements of the species with which they are diving. 8.5.8 Feeding techniques vary; for example, so me institutions favour stick-feeding of sharks, but hand-feeding may be acceptable if risk assessments have been carried out and insurers agree. 8.6 Waterfowl Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 8.6.1 Most non-domestic waterf owl are given the freedom of a pen and not contained overnight. Exclusion of predators such as foxes, cats and smaller mammals is an important part of waterfowl management. This will include use of predator-proof fencing (essential to exclude foxes), electric fenci ng, trapping and shooting. Care should be taken in selecting species for open-topped enclosures. 8.6.2 Wild waterfowl that visit the collection can present dangers in the form of disease or contamination of water supp lies. Allowance has to be made for this when planning enclosures or setting stocking densities. 8.6.3 Pens for waterfowl must be carefully designed and smaller areas may need to be at least 50% water. Less water is acceptable fo r geese which graze. Birds must be able to enter and leave the water without difficulty: therefore, edges should be sloping with a gradient of one in three or less. Perimeter fe nces should be 2 metres high (preferably 3m) and buried to approximately 0.5m. A pulsed electric fence to deter predators is essential if the fence is less than 2m high. 8.6.4 Water is essential for most species if they are to perform their normal behavioural repertoires. Water may be stat ic but systems that allow for inflow/outflow are to be preferred, so long as they do not encour age the spread of pathogeni c organisms from one pen to another. Water quality is important; areas for waterfowl need careful planning. Vegetation provides shelter, protection and shade and can prot ect birds from chilling and frostbite. Tropical species may require indoor, sometimes heated, accommodation. 8.6.5 Areas of grass may be essential for some species, e.g. Branta and Anser geese, Baikal Teal). When grass is in short supply supplementary feeding with pellets may be necessary. Waterfowl vary in their dietary re quirements but a mixture of layers pellets (the smaller size for smaller ducks) and wheat prov ides an acceptable supplement - or primary source of nutrients for most of the less specialised species. 8.6.6 Mixing of species has to be consi dered very carefully. Some waterfowl are aggressive or territorial and bes t kept apart. Others ar e sociable and will live together as a group, but care is needed to ens ure an appropriate sex ratio. Very careful thought is needed before mixing waterfowl with other spec ies of animal, such as mammals; deer, antelope and other ungulates can damage wate rfowl, or be a source of long-term stressors. Exclusion fencing, fixed 30 cm above the ground, may allow waterfowl to escape from interference. 8.6.7 Pinioning of birds is currently legal in th e UK (so long as they ar e not on agricultural land) but should not be undertaken lightly. Collections should have an ethical policy and code of practice regarding pinioning and be prepared to defend it. (see Appendix 2 - Ethical Review Process) 8.6.8 Other points particula r to waterfowl include: the availability nestboxes; incubation, brooding and fa cilities for grain storage; provision of grit (soluble and insoluble). Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. 8.6.9 Breeding facilities for waterfowl may, depending on the species, include nestboxes and nesting material). Nestbox design is all-im portant: the size and position of the opening can make a great deal of difference to br eeding success. Hybridisation should be avoided by not mixing similar species in the same pen. 8.6.10 There are human health and safety cons iderations in the keeping of waterfowl. Ponds can be a source of infectious organisms. Electric fences must be positioned such that the public cannot come into contac t with them and pond edges must be fenced where necessary. 8.6.11 Advice on the keeping of waterfowl is available from a number of organisations including the British Waterfowl Associ ation and the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust. 8.7 Birds of Prey 8.7.1 Birds of Prey (Falconiformes and Strigiforme s) are kept in a variety of ways and for a variety of reasons, These include: Aviaries, where birds enjoy relative fr eedom of movement, and are kept for display and or captive breeding. Demonstration birds, tether ed or not, that are free flow n regularly for the general public. Homing of the occasional permanently disa bled wild bird, for educ ational or captive breeding purposes. Sick or injured wild birds, kept for treatment and rehabilitation. 8.7.2 Each of these categories of keeping brings with it parti cular requirements in terms of good management. Some of these are outlined below: other relevant information is to be found in various codes of practice and publicati ons, details of which are listed in Appendix 12. Aviaries 8.7.3 Birds of prey kept in aviaries are gener ally managed in a similar way to other birds. Particular points to note are: Choice of species - Some species, su ch as accipiters, are by temperament less well suited to zoos. Their nature makes them very difficult to house and manage and they should only be kept in specialist collections. Food - Whole animal diets are needed, or meat that has been properly supplemented. No food type should be used exclusively. All birds of prey must have access to clean drinking and bathing water daily. Aviary design. Enclosures should provi de suitable vantage points for the species, as many raptors prefer to be up high. Perching should be appropriate for the species housed. Sizes should reflect the flying capabilities of the species. For example large vultures are unable to l and lightly and so need enough space to land without causing injury. Most birds of prey ar e more settled in pens with at least one solid wall. Retreats may be necessary for more nervous individuals. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. Mixing genera is rarely a good idea, and if done, should be managed with extreme care. Knowledge of the individual birds and experience in dealing with birds of prey in general is essential. Demonstration Birds 8.7.4 Tethering. Birds of prey kept as dem onstration birds are subject to restraint by tethering for part of their lives, so that t hey can be free-flown for the public. Important considerations are: Flying - Birds that are tethered must be flown at least four times a week unless tethered for medical treatment. No bird should be tethered permanently. All birds should be given the opportunity to fly or move around freely during part of the year. Rest and Moulting - All collections shoul d allow sufficient aviary space to rest working birds and allow them to moult. Birds not to be tethered - Owls and vult ures, particularly the New World vultures should not be kept tethered. They can easil y be trained to fly from pens and this is the preferred way to house them. Safety at Night - Tethered birds are very vulnerable to attack by other wild animals, so they should be well protect ed at night. Birds that are put away at night should be placed in areas that meet appropriate welfare standards under section 8 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981 and should not be left shut in for unreasonably long periods. Unless ill, owls in particular shoul d not be shut away in boxes at night. Flying Areas - Flying areas should be fr ee of hazards for birds and should not be close to cages containing animals that might catch or kill a bird should it alight on or in the cage. Taking birds to and from t he demonstration area should be made as safe and stress free as possible by travelling in a suitable vehicle. Flying areas should not be directly adjacent to, or in view of tethered birds. Staffing - Staff should be well versed in training methods, weight reduction issues, handling techniques, and maintenance of equipm ent and birds. They should also be capable of passing on the correct and up to date information about the birds to the watching public. Escape - Birds that are free-flown are alwa ys at risk of being los t. If not found, most demonstration birds will eventually die. Such incidents can be reduced by good training, experienced handlers and by ensuring that all birds being flown wear telemetry for radio tracking. Disabled Wild Birds 8.7.5 Permanently injured wild birds of prey will sometimes come into a collection and can be useful either as an educationa l bird, or, with the rarer spec ies, as a part of a captive breeding programme. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. Individual needs - The welfare and quality of life of these birds should be paramount. Badly injured birds, however rare, which are not capable of living a reasonable life should be euthanas ed. Birds which are too nervous to be displayed in public should not be kept on public di splay. Permanently disabled birds should not be tethered. Housing - Often these birds are either unable to fly and or land properly. Perching should reflect the ability of the bird in question. Pairing - When paired with non-injured birds, aggressi on levels will need to be monitored, as injured bird will be less able to cope. N.B. There are other legal requirements spec ific to many native species which should be adhered to. Sick Or Injured Wild Birds 8.7.6 Sick or injured wild birds should not, in theory, form an integral part of any zoo or collection. However, given the definition of a zoo under the Zoo Licensing Act, some establishments which tend casualties and hav e 7 or more public open days a year will be subject to the licensing requi rements of the 1981 Act and liable to inspections. Some particular points relating to such collections are: Disease Control -Sick or injured bird s are more prone to disease than healthy animals. Health monitoring and hygiene n eeds therefore need to be rigorous, in order to minimise risks to other birds, staff and visitors. Welfare - Most of the birds will have co me in from the wild and will already be stressed. Exposure to the public will ex acerbate this. It is therefore strongly recommended that save in exceptional circ umstances, recovering wild birds should not be displayed to the general public. Accommodation - Facilities must cater for injured birds' special needs. Birds destined for release may need to be kept under conditions where they can retain their escape behaviour, gain confidence and fitness in flight and behave naturally. 8.7.7 The requirements for owls (nocturnal bi rds of prey) closely mirror those described above, with some differences. The Owl TAG has produced its own guidelines and these should be used for reference. 8.7.8 Some birds of prey in zoos may be subj ect to control under several different pieces of legislation, for example the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and CITES. Legislation concerning welfare, animal healt h, travel, and veterinary treat ment may be relevant. It is important for operators to understand wh ich legislation applies to zoos. Zoo Licensing Act 1981. Pre Inspection Audit. Appendix 9 - Staff & Staff Training Training 9.1 Continuous in-house staf f training and development (eg In vestors in People) should be a standard feature of the zoo.

National of Modern Zoo Practice (\"the Standards\") Issued January 2006 86 Appendix 12 - Hazardous Animal Categorisation Animal Kinds, with Respect to Danger to Members of the Public Visiting Zoological Gardens Zoo animals are categorized in the following list into 3 risk levels on the basis of the animal's likely ferocity and ability to cause harm to people, and the scale of harm if it should do so: Category '1' (Greater Risk) 1.1 Contact between the public and animals in Category '1' is likely to cause serious injury or be a serious threat to life, on the basis of hazard and risk of injury, toxin or disease, irrespective of the age and vulnerability of the visitor. 1.2 Animals in Category '1 ' must either be separated fr om the public by a barrier of suitable design in order to prevent physical contact between the animals and members of the public within their designate d areas, or, with the prior approval of the local authority, be provided with adequate supervisi on to allow the public and the animals to be in the same area without hazard. 1.3 The responsibility for any relaxation of the need to provide non-touch barriers (i.e. prevent direct contact between ani mal and public) for Category '1' species lies with the Licensing Authority, acti ng upon the advice of inspectors nominated by the National Assembly for Wales. 1.4 Animals in Category '1' may only be taken out of their enclosures and into the same areas as members of the public, or the public into the animals' enclosures, if the operator of the zoological gar dens, being the keeper of the animals, has reason to believe (by virtue of the anima ls' ages, sexual states, supervision, training, individual histories, enclosure size and design, or other relevant matters) and has satisfied the local authority that he has such reason, that the animals, being under the supervision of authoris ed and experienced members of staff, will not cause injury to the public. Category '2' (Less Risk) 2.1 Contact between the public and animals in Category '2' may result in injury or illness, on the basis of hazard and risk of in jury, toxin or disease, but is not likely to be life threatening. 2.2 Animals in Category '2' would no rmally be separated from the public by a barrier, but this barrier need not, of nec essity, prevent all physical contact National Assembly for Wales' Standa rds of Modern Zoo Practice (\"the Standards\") Issued January 2006 87between the animals and mem bers of the public, though it should be such as to render negligible any risk involved. The responsibility for assessing the kind of barriers needed for Category '2' species lies wit h the operator of the z oological garden, who must take into account the behaviour of the i ndividual animals and of other factors as are relevant to each situation. 2.3 Some Category '2' animals, given adequate space and refuge, may be maintained as free ranging, free-flyi ng or walk-through exhibits. In these circumstances the operator must be able to satisfy the local authority, citing relevant experience, that it is reasonabl e that the species involved can be safely exhibited in the manner pr oposed. The operator must also be able to satisfy the local authority that the individual animals in such exhibits are unlikely to cause harm to members of the public. 2.4 The operator of the zoological gar den, keeping a Category '2' animal which has behaved in a way which has caused injury, or was likely to have caused injury or transmitted diseas e, is obliged to treat that animal as if it were in Category '1'. Category '3' (Least Risk) 3.1 All animals not listed in Category '1 ' or Category '2' are automatically in Category '3'. This does not necessarily m ean that they do not present a hazard or risk to members of the publ ic. This category contains many taxa in respect of which knowledge and experie nce of captivity is currently lacking. The zoo operator should, therefor e, carry out a risk assessment to determine the appropriate barrier. 3.2 The keeper of any individual animal in Category '3' that has behaved in a way that has caused injury, or was likely to have caused injury or transmit disease, is obliged to treat that animal as if it were in Category '1'. Notes The following notes are additional to the above and are intended to help inspectors to interpret the categorisations and the listings. Note 1: This list is intended to indicate the level of hazard and risk to members of the public from animals kept in premises licensed under the Zoo Licensing Act, 1981. It should not be interpre ted as indicating the level of hazard and risk from animals encountered in any other circumstances. In particular it should not be used to indicate the level of hazard and risk from animals kept in homes, circuses, pet shops and other plac es not covered by the Zoo Licensing National Assembly for Wales' Standa rds of Modern Zoo Practice (\"the Standards\") Issued January 2006 88Act, 1981, which are subject to the Danger ous Wild Animals Act, 1976, for which a separate schedule exists. This list does not take account of animal welfare. Note 2: The list will act as an aid to inspectors in determining whether a barrier is appropriate for a particular specie s or individual. It should also aid zoo operators in carrying out risk assessments on barrier types from a public safety perspective, which should be done in a ccordance with guidance issued by the Health and Safety Executive in their pub lication - Managing Health and Safety in Zoos. Risk assessments should reflect the peculiarities of any particular animal kept, irrespective of the categorisation afforded to its species in this list, and should take into account the potential for theft or actions of unbalanced members of the public. Note 3a: Animals in Category '1' may only be exhibited to the public in the absence of non-touch barriers with the prio r approval of the local authority. Note 3b: Category '2' animals ma y, under certain circumstances, be exhibited to the public in the absenc e of non-touch barriers. Although prior approval by the local authority is not r equired, the operator of the zoological garden must be able to provide the lo cal authority with precedents and other relevant information which show the practi ce to be safe. In cases of doubt, or where there is no precedent, the operator s hould seek the advice of a suitably knowledgeable member of t he Zoos Forum (who may if necessary, consult the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (formerly the Federation of Zoological Gardens of Great Britain and Ireland)). Note 3c: Where Category '2' spec ies are exhibited without non-touch barriers (e.g. in walk-through areas, areas with no stand-off barriers, exhibits involving public handling, and free-flyi ng demonstrations), the details of the practices being followed must be recor ded in writing and be made available to the inspectors under the Zoo Licensing Ac t, 1981, and the local authority, at the time of any subsequent inspection. Note 4*: The likelihood of bites, pecks, scratches, etc. caused by any individual animal which is in unusual circ umstances (for example which is being injudiciously handled, or cornered thereby affecting its behaviour) is not to be taken as a measure of the natur al ferocity of a species. * This is mentioned so that species aren't considered overly hazardous on the basis of anecdotal reports of behavior under such circumstances. Note 5: In some species, e.g. those which live in herds, there is a greater likelihood of attack and injury from t he leading animals (usually the leading males) than from other mem bers of the group, especially in any breeding season. Extra caution is required at such times. In mammal species in which the young accompany the females, nursing fema les are likely to present a higher National Assembly for Wales' Standa rds of Modern Zoo Practice (\"the Standards\") Issued January 2006 89level of risk than at other times. Bird s defending eggs and hatchlings are likely to present a higher level of ri sk than at other times. Note 6 : In most species, the young do not present the same order of hazard as might be expected from adults (except in the case of venomous animals). Whilst in some instances hand -reared animals are safer than naturally reared animals, this is not always so, par ticularly with species of wild ungulates and many species of birds. Because of their very small size, young of many hazardous invertebrate species require mo re stringent security than the larger adults. Unless otherwise stated in the list bel ow, the age, size or sex of a specimen of a Category '1' species cannot be used to justify treating it as a lower category of risk, except with the prior appr oval of the local authority (see 1.3, 1.4 and note 3a above). In any event, zoo oper ators are reminded to carry out risk assessments if treating any individuals differ ently from the category to which they are assigned in this list. Note 7: The list below includes all t hose kinds of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates that ar e thought to present significant hazards in zoological gardens and aquaria (ie thos e falling within Categories '1' and '2'). Any variation in classification and nomenc lature may not be taken to imply that the categorisation of a spec ies has changed. The barrier for any taxa not listed in either Category '1' or '2' must be determined by the zo o operator on the basis of risk assessments, which should be open to scrutiny by inspectors. Note 8: Hybrid animals should be plac ed in the same category as the more hazardous of the parent species. Note 9: Animals normally domesticat ed in Britain have not been included in this list. Attention is drawn to the possib ility that individuals of such species may be very dangerous. Note 10: Where categorization is of a taxon of animals, e.g. the genus Cacatua , the categorization has been made on the basis of the highest risk species within that taxon. Note 11: In the case of bird species listed in Category '2' (Less Risk), attention is drawn to the hazard of injury from beaks and talons, in particular in the case of birds which are tethered in mews, e.g. birds of prey. Such birds should, when unsupervised, be separated by a non-touch barrier from members of the public. Note 12a: Attention is drawn to the haz ard of all zoonotic infections, but with particular emphasis on the possible higher risks of humans contracting Chlamydia infection from some birds, incl uding parrots and related species, and National Assembly for Wales' Standa rds of Modern Zoo Practice (\"the Standards\") Issued January 2006 90Salmonella and similar infections from some rept iles, including tort oises, if they are closely handled. Note 12b: It is also stressed that the higher primates are more closely related to man, and may therefore be more likely to carry zoonotic diseases. The risk of serious disease being carried in this manner is greater in imported animals than in long-established groups. There is also the risk of higher primates acting as intermediaries in the transfer of disease from one human to another. Note 13: Attention is drawn to the po ssible risk of humans contracting rabies from many mammalian species, should t he disease become indigenous. The risk from newly imported animals is contro lled under quarantine regulations and is outside the scope of these provisions.
