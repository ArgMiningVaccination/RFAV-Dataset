AFDC and AFDC - related Medicaid recipients must participate in HealthMACS if they live in a county in which HealthMACS has been implemented. Chiropractic services are included in HealthMACS as approved in the waiver by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) . HealthMACS requirements will be applicable to chiropractor claims for dates of service on and after November 1, 1996. Chiropractors providing chiropractic services for HealthMACS enrollees should be aware that authorization must be obtained from the patient's HealthMACS PCP prior to treatment. Without prior authorization from the PCP, chiropractors will not receive payment from Medicaid for services provided to HealthMACS patients. Chiropractors and any other Medicaid providers may verify that a Medicaid recipient is enrolled in the HealthMACS program in one of two ways. One, when using the Medicaid ID swipe card device to determine eligibility, there is a section on the tape for managed care. If the recipient is in HealthMACS, it will be indicated in this section along with the name and telephone number of the PCP. Two, when calling (Continued on page 2) Chiropractic services are included in HealthMACS as approved in the waiver by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA).The Mississippi Medicaid Bulletin Page 2 Chiropractors providing chiropractic services for HealthMACS enrollees should be aware that authorization must be obtained from the patient's HealthMACS PCP prior to treatment.the automated voice response system, information about managed care enrollment is given. If the recipient is in HealthMACS, the name and telephone number of the PCP are given. For chiropractors who are treating a HealthMACS patient, Field 19 on the HCFA- 1500 will be used for an 11-digit number which will identify the authorization number/x-ray data. The first 7 digits will be the authorization number from the PCP and the next 4 numbers will be x-ray data as indicated below. Chiropractors who do not treat HealthMACS patients will use only the 4-digit number for x-ray data. The x-ray data has been changed from 7 digits to 4 digits to accommodate HealthMACS requirements . The first digit remains the same and is either 2, 3, 4, or 5. The next 2 digits are the month and the last digit is the last digit of the year. The specific day is no longer required. Examples of x-ray data are as follows: 2MMY - Date of x-ray (must be within 12 months of the date of service) 3MMY - Expected date of delivery 4MMY - Date of last menstrual period 5MMY - Child's birth date (For children 12 years of age or less, the x-ray is left to the discretion of the chiropractor. If the x-ray is done, report using the \"2\" number with the date of x-ray. If the x-ray is not done, report using the 5 number with the child's date of birth.) For example, the 4-digit x-ray number may be 2086 which would indicate that an x- ray was taken in August of 1996. Another example is 3126 which would mean that no x-ray was taken because the patient is pregnant and expected to deliver in December of 1996. An example of the 11-digit number for the HealthMACS patient is 98765432086. The number must be written in consecutive order with no spaces. An example of the 4-digit number for the non-HealthMACS patient is 2086. Either number, whichever is applicable, must be correctly indicated in Field 19 on the HCFA-1500 Claim Form . Chiropractors should have received the Mississippi Medicaid Chiropractor Manual from EDS. Chapter 4 of this manual provides more detailed information regarding PCP authorization and the overall HealthMACS program. Also, the May 1996 and the October 1996 Medicaid Provider Bulletins have articles regarding HealthMACS billing for referrals and authorized services.

Important Reminder for Vaccine Providers The Division of Medicaid reimburses for the administration of vaccine ONLY if you obtain your vaccine from the Vaccine for Children (VFC) Program through the Mississippi State Department of Health. We do not pay for the administration when you obtain the vaccine from other sources. We encourage you to contact Letitia Thompson with the State Department of Health at 1-800-634-9258 or 601-960-7751 to enroll in the VFC Program.The Mississippi Medicaid Bulletin Page 4 HealthMACS - Billing for Excluded Services The Managed Care Division has received questions from providers having difficulties obtaining authorization numbers from HealthMACS Primary Care Providers (PCP) for excluded services . We would like to remind HealthMACS PCPs that although some services are excluded from the HealthMACS program, authorization numbers must be passed without discretion of the excluded service being provided. It is not necessary that the HealthMACS PCP receive medical documentation for the patient's medical record for an excluded service . A servicing provider of an excluded service may request lab work or x-rays for a HealthMACS patient. In order for the lab or radiology department to receive payment for services, a HealthMACS authorization number is required on all claims for services referred by a provider of an excluded service . The excluded services for HealthMACS are listed below : Dental Psychiatry Ophthalmology Optometry and Eye Glasses Podiatry Nursing Home and ICF-MR General Transportation and Ambulance/Wheelchair Van Hearing Aids Example of an excluded service that requires a HealthMACS Authorization Number for billing purposes: A HealthMACS patient is scheduled for Oral Surgery to be performed by a Dental Surgeon. Because the patient will need services from other providers, such as an anesthesiologist, it will be necessary for the HealthMACS PCP to pass authorization in order for the anesthesiologist to receive payment for services he/she provides to the HealthMACS patient. Influenza Vaccines for Long Term Care Facility Residents Flu vaccines will be reimbursed by the DOM for residents with a payment source of Medicaid-only in nursing facilities, ICF-MRs and Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities. Facilities may have a physician come to the facility and administer the injection or may send a resident to the physician's office for the injection. The physician may bill and be reimbursed by Medicaid. OR The facility may purchase the flu vaccine, administer the injection and claim the cost of the vaccine in the Medicaid cost report for Medicaid-only residents. Medicare must be billed for residents with a payment source of Medicaid/Medicare. The facility cannot claim the cost of the flu vaccine in the Medicaid cost report for Medicaid/Medicare residents.If you have any questions concerning any information in this bulletin or would like to receive additional bulletins, please call the EDS Correspondence Unit at 1-800-884-3222.The Mississippi Medicaid Bulletin Page 5 HMO Pilot Project Provider Workshop for Warren County A provider workshop has been planned for those Medicaid providers who provide services to recipients of Warren County.
