It is a divine portal that literally connects two worlds - spirit and physical. It is through the womb that you were birthed into this world. This magical place within you is a space for creation and birth in every sense, whether you are birthing new life, creative projects or ideas into reality. The womb is the source of your infinite power and creative energy. Through consciously connecting to your womb you can activate your intuition, gifts, purpose, joy, sensuality and truth. However, the womb can also hold trauma, pain and suppressed emotions and it can become a heavy space within us when we allow these energetic blocks to build up. Over time the energy in our womb can become stagnant which can then manifest in the physical body as an ailment, pain or imbalance. I believe this is why we are hearing about so many issues coming up in the womb space for women right now but I choose to see this as a wake up call from the womb as if she is calling us to remember her wisdom and her power. As if she is calling us home to really be with ourselves and our divine feminine essence as this is where we can truly thrive. It is also important to remember that any blocks held in the womb can also root beyond our own experiences as we can carry the collective feminine wounds, the wounds of our ancestors and the wounds of Mother Earth. However, once we begin doing the work and connecting to our sacred womb space, shifts can happen so rapidly than span over many timelines and create ripples far and wide through our family lines and the world. It is my mission to bring the incredible power and divine consciousness of the womb to light as this powerful place within us has been suppressed for too long. It is time to remember our truth. For the womb holds the key to reawaken us to our deep feminine power and bring us home to ourselves. WHAT TO EXPECT? Each session is your own healing ceremony devoted to you and your sacred womb space. It is guided intuitively depending on your needs but the focus is always on bringing awareness and connection to your womb and supporting you to connect with your divine feminine essence. You will be held in a nurturing and compassionate space so you can truly surrender into the experience. We will open the sacred space and drink ceremonial cacao which is a beautiful heart opening plant medicine known as Mother Cacao. Whilst cacao integrates I will guide you through a gentle yet powerful healing journey through ritual, energy work, sound, womb blessing, meditation and channeled light language transmissions. I will call upon spirit to assist in the healing process and open myself up as a channel for healing energies to flow to ignite clearing and activation. Most importantly the intention is to allow you to connect with the voice of your womb. I weave sound frequencies throughout the entire journey to support your process. Sound is a powerful healing gateway which truly speaks to every cell of our being and raises our consciousness. I find sound tools become vessels for healing energy to flow, deepening the shifts and helping you to fully open. I work closely with alchemy crystal bowls attuned to the womb and endocrine system which will bathe your entire being with crystalline consciousness. I also use tuning forks both on and off the body, which correspond to the womb, chakras, physical body and emotional body. Tuning forks are like laser beams of high frequencies moving directly into the body and energy so they are incredible for shifting dense emotions and activating life force energy. Through energy work with my hands I will address blockages and imbalances in your womb, heart, body and energy. Throughout the session I may also guide you on a journey within to explore any suppressed emotions and blocks, supporting you to connect to the wisdom of your womb and acknowledge anything holding you back to support true release and open to whatever you are calling in, whether it is new life or a deeper connection to yourself and your body or greater joy and pleasure. Through holding one to one healing sessions over the years, I have supported many women in reconnecting to the sacred temple of their womb space and igniting deep shifts in the emotional and physical - such as working successfully with fertility issues and supporting the conception journey, low libido, PCOS, IBS, digestive issues, sciatica, eczema, low self-worth, trauma release and bringing the menstrual cycle back into balance when they have had no cycle or irregular cycles. Womb work is truly transformational and will only meet you where you are ready to be met in that moment. I am deeply honoured to hold this important space for you if this calls you. If you have any questions at all about this work please reach out via josie@elevenhealing.com Having recently birthed my baby into the world at the start of 2021 I feel passionate about supporting women through the rite of passage of pregnancy, birth, postpartum and motherhood. Whatever stage of the journey you are at then womb work is deeply supportive. The healing I had done for my own womb over the years in preparation to bring a soul Earthside has been transformative so I know first hand the shifts it ignites. WHO IS THIS SESSION FOR? This offering is for women If you do not have a physical womb, you can still connect to the spiritual womb in the same way and this can be an intention in itself Are you experiencing fertility issues?
