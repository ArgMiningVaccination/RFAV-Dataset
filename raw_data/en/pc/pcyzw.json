Method We performed a systematic search in various medical databases for systematic reviews about intervention s to prevent of allergy in child- ren. The search was performed in july 2012 and was limited to the period 2009-2012. Both authors screened the identified references for relevance in accordance wi th the inclusion criteria. Results We identified 450 unique references in total. Of these 81 were con- sidered potentially relevant for prev ention of allery in children. We arranged the references into five groups according to which factors that might be the cause the allergy. 4 reviews was about guidelines, other possible confounders and the importance of geographical area 17 reviews was about factors rela ted to genetic disposition and the illnesses and actions of the parents 13 reviews was about factors related to the child's history of illnesses 24 reviews was about factors relate d to the nutrition of the child 22 reviews was about factors related to the environment of the child.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is c omparatively little information in the public domain on the diversity in prevalence an d triggers/factors associated with allergic rhinitis (AR) or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (AR/C) in countries beyond west ernEurope and North America., OBJECTIVE: To review the prevalence and the sensitizi ng agents/triggers and factors associated with AR/C in several countries in Africa, th e AsiaPacific region, Aus tralia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Middle East and Turkey., METHODS: Articles published in English in peerrev iewed journals were assessed an d selected for further review, following an extensive li terature search using the Medl ine database., RESULTS: This review demonstrated that prevalence of AR and AR/C in thes e regions has predo minantly been investigated in ch ildren; with studies indicating wide inter and intra regional variations ranging from 2.9% AR and 3.8% AR/C in 1018 yearsold children from one region in to 54.1% AR and 39.2% AR/C in 1314y earsold children in one region in Nigeria. Moreover, the prevalence of AR and AR/C has increased marked ly over the last decade particul arly in some of the more afflue nt African countries, Chi naTaiwan and several Middle East countries, likely as a conseq uence of improved liv ing standards leading to increas ed exposure to multiple traditi onal and nontraditional sensitizing agents and risk fact ors similar to those noted in w esternEurope and North 12 Resultat America., CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICA L RELEVANCE: Our findings sugg est that the greater diversity in prevalence of AR or AR/C in populations in these regions is in con trast to the lower diversity of AR or AR/C in the 'western popu lations (USA and Eu rope), which tend to be more uniform. This review provides a co mprehensive database of the important allergens and triggers which are likely to inf luence the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in these diverse regions, where the prevalenc e of allergic rhinitis is in creasing and its adverse impact on the quality of life of affec ted individuals is increa singly recognised.

Abstract: The further increase o f allergies in industrialized c ountries demands evi dencebased measures of primary prevention. The recommendations as published in the guideline of 2004 were updat ed and consented on the basis o f a systematic litera ture search. Evidence from the pe riod February 2003May 2008 wa s searched in the electronic databases Cochrane and MEDLINE as well as in referen ce lists of recent re views and by contacting experts. The retrieved citations were s creened for relevance first by title and abstract and in a second step as full paper. Levels of evidence were as signed to each included study and the methodological quality of the studies was as sessed as high or low. Finally the revised recommendations were formally consented (nominal group process) by repres entatives of relevant societie s and organizations in cluding a selfhelp group. Of ori ginally 4556 hits, 217 studies (4 Cochrane Reviews, 14 metaanalyses, 19 rand omized controlled tria ls, 135 cohort and 45 casecontrol stu dies) were included and critica lly appraised. Grossly unchanged remained the recom mendations on avoiding environme ntal tobacco smoke, breastfeed ing over 4 months (alternatively hypoalle rgenic formulas for children at risk), a voiding a moldpromoting indoor climate, vaccination accord ing to current recommendation s, and avoidance of furry pets (especially cats) in ch ildren at risk. The recommend ation on reducing the house dust mite allergen exposur e as a measure of primary preve ntion was omitted and the impact of a delayed intr oduction of supplementary food was reduced. New rec ommendations were adopted concer ning fish consumption (during p regnancy / breast feeding and as supplementary foo d in the first year), avoidance of overweight, and re ducing the exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollutants. The r evision of this guideline on a profound evidence basis led to (1) a confirmation of exist ing recommendations, (2) substantial revisions, and ( 3) new recommendations. Thereby it is possible to give evidencebased and uptodate re commendations on primary preven tion of allergies Nurmatov U, Nwaru BI, Devereux G, Sheikh A. Confounding and eff ect modification in studies of diet and childh ood asthma and allergies. Allergy 2012;67(8):104159. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To propose a comprehensive set of confound ers and effect mod ifiers that should be considered in epidemiologic investigation s., METHODS: Two re viewers independently critiqued studies included in a recent sy stematic review and extracted data on the confounders and effect modifiers that wer e considered and the approaches used to justify inclu sion., RESULTS: Of the 62 studi es reviewed, 20 were cohort, 16 casecontrol, 25 cross sectional studies, and one ec ologic study. All cohort, crosssectional, and ecologic stud ies had some adjustment for c onfounding or consid eration of effect modification, b ut this was only the case for 7/16 (44%) casecontrol studies. Of the 53 studies that considered confounding or effec t modification, 39/53 (74%) gave no justification for the inclusion of the variables considered. Studies that justified the inclusion of the v ariables did so based on empiri cal evidence (n[NON BREAKING SPA SPACE]=[NONBREAKING CE]7), or a comb of the two (n[NON BREAKING SPACE]=[NONBREAKING SPA CE]3). Confounding was handled mainly by using regression modeling, but so me casecontrol studies utiliz ed matching and anova. Ten studies handled effect modif ication by stratification, eigh t tested for interaction, and five used both strategies., CONCLUSIONS: We have found subs tantial shortcomings in the handling of confounding an d effect modification in studi es of diet and develop ment of childhood asthma/allergie s. Selection of variables shou ld be based on concep tual considerations and empirical evidence. Using this approach , we have proposed a comprehensive set of c onfounders and effect modifiers that need to be considered in future studies. van Gemert F, van der Molen T, Jones R, Chavannes N. The impact of asthma and COPD in subSaharan Africa. Prim care respir j 2011;20(3):2408. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Many count ries in subSaharan Africa have the highest risk of developing chronic diseases and are the least able to cope with them., AIMS: To assess the current knowledge of the preva lence and impact of asthma an d chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in sub Saharan Africa., METHODS: A li terature search was conducted using Medline (199520 10) and Google Scholar., RESULT S: Eleven studies of the prevalence of asthma in subSaharan Africa were identified, all of which showed a consistent increase, particularly in urban regions. The data on asthma show a wide var iation (5.720.3%), with the highest prevalence in 'westernised ' urban areas. Only two studies of the prevalence of COPD in subSaharan Africa have be en performed. Never theless, COPD has become an increasing health problem in subSa haran Africa due to tobacco smoking and exposure to biomass fuels. In most countrie s of subSaharan Afri ca, 90% of the rural households d epend on biomass fuel for cook ing and heating, affect ing young children (acute lower respiratory infections) and wom en (COPD). This is the cause of significant mortality and morbidity in the region., CO NCLUSIONS: Asthma and COPD in subSaharan Africa are u nderrecognised, underdiagnose d, undertreated, and insufficiently prevented. A m ajor priority is to increase t he awareness of asthma and COPD and their risk factors, particularly the damage caused by biomass fuel. Sur veys are needed to provide local healthcare workers with the po ssibility of controlling asthma and Ma Wang YP, Guo XM, et al. IL13 polym 2012;45(45):2858. Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The purpos e of was to evaluate the effects of interleu kin13 (IL13) polymorphisms on the risk of asthma using a meta analysis., DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifteen publications were identified by searching Pubm ed, Embase, ISI, OVID, and EBSCO databases. Odds ratios with corresponding 95% confide nce intervals were computed to estimate the associat ion between IL13 polymorphism s and risk of asthma., RESULTS: The polymorphisms R 130Q (rs20541) and 1112C/T in IL13 with signif icantly increased risks of asth ma in overall analyses. Sub 14 Resultat group analyses showed that the e levated risks o ccurred in adult onset asthma, Cauca sians, and high quality studies., CONCLUSIONS: This metaanalys is provides evidence that the R130Q and 1112C/T polymorphis ms in IL13 are risk factors for asthma.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is evidence to suggest that the ris k of asthma might be increased with exposure to parace tamol in the intrauterine envi ronment, infancy, later childhood and adult life., OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence fr om studies investigating the association betwee n paracetamol use in pregnancy and childh ood asthma., ME THODS: A systematic review and m etaanalysis was undertaken of studies reporting the association betwee n paracetamol use in p regnancy and subseq uent asthma in childhood. The primary outcome variable was wheeze in the last 12 months. For tabu lated raw data, not adj usted for confounders, random effects od ds ratios (OR) were pooled by the inverse variance weighted method., RESULTS: There were six studies identified that were included in the metaanalysis. The age of children studied ranged from 30 to 84 months. The pooled random effects OR for the risk of current wheeze in the children of women who were e xposed to any paracetamol durin g any stage of preg nancy was 1.21 (95% confidence in terval 1.021.44). Features of the studies variably included an association with paracetamol use during all trimest ers of pregnancy and an association with persistent asth ma, severe asthma, and with ato py., CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The use of p aracetamol during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of childhood asthm a. More research is urgently r equired to determine the impact of paracetamol during pregnancy on the risk of wheez ing in offspring so that appropriate public health recommendations can be made. Jurewicz J, Hanke W. Exposure to phthalates: reproductive outco me and children health. A review of epidemiological studies. Int J Occup Med Environ H ealth 2011;24(2):11541. Abstract: Phthalates are a famil y of industrial chemicals that have been used for a va riety of purposes. As the potent ial consequences of human expos ure to phthalates have raised concerns in the general po pulation, they have been studi ed in susceptible sub jects such as pregnant women, in fants and children. This articl e aims at evaluating the impact of exposure to phthalates on reproductive outcomes and c hildren health by re viewing most recent published li terature. Epidemiological studi es focusing on exposure to phthalates and pregnancy outc ome, genital development, semen quality, precocious puberty, thyroid function, respi ratory symptoms and neurodevelo pment in children for the last ten years were identified by a search of the PubMed, M edline, Ebsco, Agricola and Toxnet literature bases. The results from the presented stu dies suggest that there are strong and rather consistent indications that phthalates in crease the risk of allergy and asthma and have an adverse i mpact on children's neurodevelo pment reflected by quality of alertness among girls , decreased (less masculine) co mposite score in boys and attention deficit hyperactiv ity disorder. Results of few st udies demonstrate nega tive associations between phthala te levels commonly experienced by the public and impaired sperm quality (concentration, morphology, motility). P hthalates negatively impact also on gestational age an d head circumference; however, the results of the stu dies were not consistent. In all the reviewed studies, exposure to phthalates adversely affected the level of reproducti ve hormones (luteinizing hormon e, free testosterone, sex hormonebinding globulin), a nogenital distance and thyroid function. The urinary levels of phthalates were significantly higher in the pubertal gynecomastia group, in serum in girls with premature th elarche and in girls with preco cious puberty. Epidemi ological studies, in spite of th eir limitations, suggest that p hthalates may affect repro 15 Resultat ductive outcome and children health. Considering the suggested health effects, more epidemiologic data is urgently needed and, in the meantime, pre cautionary policies must be implemented Klemens CM, Berman DR, Mozurkewi ch EL. The effect of perinatal omega3 fatty acid sup plementation on inflammatory markers a s ystematic BJOG (n3 PUFA) may modulate im mune responses and allergy in n eonates and children., OBJECTIVE: To determine if n3 P UFA supplementati on during preg nancy and lactation reduces risk for childhood allerg ic disease., SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched Medline and all evidencebased medicine revi ews for randomised rials comparing ef fects of n3 PUFA and placebo su pplementation during pregnancy and/or lactation on childhood allergic diseases and inflammatory cytokines., SELECT ION CRITERIA: We in cluded studies reporting on food allergy, response to the egg s kin prick test (SPT), atopy and asthma in infancy and childh ood as well as production of in terleukin13 and interfe rongamma, two cytokines involve d in the pathogenesis of asthma . For assessment of in clusion, two authors reviewed all abstracts for suitability and independently extracted data., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYS IS: Twobytwo tables were con structed and odds ratios (OR) were calculated for the outcomes: response to the S PT, food allergy, atopy and asthma in childhood. The assays differed so data on inflammator y markers were reported in narrative form., MAIN RESULTS: Five randomised controlled tr ials (n = 949) were in cluded. n3 PUFA supplementation during pregnancy reduced 12mo nth prevalence of positive egg SPT (two trials, 12/87 versus 32/100, OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.16, 0.70) and child hood asthma (two trials, 10/303 versus 17/179, OR 0.349, 95% CI erleukin13 leve ls. Supplement ation during lactation did not allerg y or atopy., CONCLUSION: n3 PUF A supplementation dur ing pregnancy decreases ood asthma and response to SPT.

European journal of human genetics : EJHG 2012; Mar 14. doi: 10.1038/ejhg.2012.46. [Epub ahead of print] Abstract: Allergic rhinitis (AR) complex disorder with a p olygenic, multifactorial aeti ology. Twin studies have found t he genetic contribution to be s ubstantial. We collected and clinically characterised a sa mple consisting of 127 Danish nuclear families with at least two siblings suffering fro m AR or allergic conjunctivitis including 540 individuals (286 children and 254 parents). A wholegenome linkage scan, us ing 424 microsatellite markers, was performed on both t his sample and an earlier colle cted sample consisting of 130 families with atopic dermati tis and other atopic disorders. A third sibpair family sample, which was previously co llected and genotyped, was added to the analysis increas ing the total sample size to 357 families consis ting of 1508 in dividuals. In to tal, 190 fami lies with AR was included. The linkage analysis software Genehu nter NPL, Genehunter MOD, and Genehunter Imprinting w ere used to obtain nonparametri c and parametric lin kage results. Familybased association analysis of positional c andidate SNPs was carried out using the FBAT program. We o btained genomewide significant linkage to a novel AR locus at 1p13 and suggestive lin kage to 20p12, respec tively. Familybased the candid ate locus DNND1B/CRB1 at 1q31 showed no significant association and could not explain th e linkage signal observed. Suggestive evidence of linkage w as also obtained at three AR lo ci previously reported (2q14q23, 2q23, and 12p13) and i ndication of linkage was at a number of addi 16 Resultat tional loci. Likely mat ernal imprinting was observed at 2q23, a nd possible maternal im printing at 3q28. Lim RH, Kobzik L, Dahl M. Risk f or asthma in offspring of asthm atic mothers versus fa thers: BACKGROUND: Many human epidemiologic studies demonstr ate that mater nal asthma confers greater risk o f asthma to offspring than doe s paternal disease. How ever, a handful have shown the o pposite. Given this disparity, a metaanalysis is neces sary to determine the veracity a of the \"maternal e ffect.\", METHODOLO GY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We screen ed the medical literature from 1966 to 2009 and performed a meta analysis to compare the effect of maternal ast hma vs. paternal asth ma on offspring asthma susceptib ility. Aggregating data from 33 studies, the odds ratio for asthma in children of asthma tic mothers compared with nona sthmatic mothers was significantly increased at 3.04 (95% confidence interval: 2 .593.56). The corres ponding odds ratio for asthma in children of asthmatic fathers was increased at 2.44 (2.142.79). When comparing the odds ratios, maternal asthma co nferred greater risk of disease than did paternal asthma (3.04 vs. 2.44, p = 0.037). When analyzing the stu dies in which asthma was diagnos ed by a physician the odds rati os were attenuated and no significant differences w ere observed (2.85 vs. 2.48, N = 18, p = 0.37). Similarly, no significant differences were observed between maternal and p aternal odds ratios when analyzing the studies in which the patient population was 5 years or older (3.15 vs. 2.60, p = 0.14). However, in all cases the trend remained t he same, that maternal asthma was a greater risk factor for asthma than paternal., CON CLUSIONS/SIGNIFI CANCE: The results show that ma ternal asthma increases offsprin g disease risk to a greater extent than paternal disease.

Association between biomarkerquantified antioxidant status during pregnanc y and infancy and allergic disease during early c hildhood: a systematic review. Nutr Rev 2011;69(11):62741. Abstract: Recent findings sugges t a significant association bet ween the antioxidant sta tus of pregnant women and of the ir children during the first ye ars of life and the devel opment of allergic disease durin g childhood. The aim of this re view was to identify all studies that estimated the effect of intake of antioxidants in pregnant women and their children on the development of a llergic disease during early ch ildhood. A systematic review was conducted of epidemiol ogical studies featuring origi nal peerreviewed data on the association between dietar y antioxidant status and aller gic disease during child hood. A systematic sea rch was performed fo llowing the Metaanal ysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology Guidelin es. A comprehensive search of t he literature yielded 225 studies, 18 of which were selected for the extraction of re sults and were related to antioxidant status and allergic disease. The systematic review included five prospective cohort studies, four crosssecti onal studies, and nine casecon trol studies. Eight studies reported an important association between antioxidant status an d asthma onset during childhood. Similarly, wheezing and eczema were studied as an ou tcome in six and in five studies, respectively. Rece nt observational studies sugges t that a higher intake of antioxidant vitamins, zinc, and selenium during pregnancy and c hildhood reduces the likelihood of childhood asthma, wheezing, and eczema. 17 Resultat Ricci G, Astolfi A, S, Dondi A , et al. Pooled genome wide analysis to identify novel r isk loci for pediatric allergi c asthma. PloS one 2011;6(2):e16912. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Genomewid e association studies of pooled DNA samples were shown to be a valuable tool to identify candidate SNPs ass ociated to a phenotype. No such study was up to now applied to childhood allergic asthm a, even if the very high complexity of asthma g enetics is an appropriate field to explor e the potential of pooled GWAS approach., METHODOLOGY/PRIN CIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a pooled GWAS and individual genotyping i n 269 children with allergic re spiratory diseases comparing allergic children with and without asthma. We used a modular approach to identify the most significant lo ci associated with asthma by co mbining silhouette statis tics and physical distance metho d with clusteradapted threshol ding. We found 97% concordance between pooled GWAS a nd individual genotyping, with 36 out of 37 top scoring SNPs significant at indi vidual genotyping level. The mo st significant SNP is lo cated inside the codin g sequence of C5, an already identified a sthma susceptibility gene, while the other loci regulate functions that are relevant to bronchial physiopa thology, as immune or inflammationmediated mechanisms and air way smooth mus cle contraction. Integration with gene expression data showed t hat almost half of the putative susceptibility genes ar e differentially expressed in e xperimental asthma mouse models., CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Combined silhouette sta tistics and clus teradapted physical distance th reshold analysis of pooled GWAS data is an efficient method to identify candidate SNP associated to asthma developme nt in an allergic pe diatric population Shams K, Grindlay DJC, Williams HC. What's new in atopic eczema ? An analysis of 20092010. Clin Exp Dermatol 2011;36(6):5738. Abstract: This review provides a summary of key findings from 1 8 systematic reviews on atopic eczema, published or in dexed between January 2009 and 24 August 2010. There was no good evidence on the possible benefit of organic f ood consumption and eczema. Maternal intake of fish or fish oil may be associated w ith a reduced risk of ec zema in offspring, although furt her studies are needed. There i s some evidence that partially hydrolysed infant formu las rather than standard formu las may be associated with a reduced risk of eczema in infants, but there are shortco mings in the existing evi dence. An inverse relationship has been found between gliomas/a cute lymphoblastic leukaemia and allergic disease/eczema, but there appears to be no association between multiple sclerosis and eczema. A ttention deficit hyperactivity disorder does appear to be associated with eczema, but there is no evidence of a causal link. The risk of eczema seems to be increased in urban co mpared with rural areas. Some new evidence has suggested superiority of 1% pime crolimus over potent and mild c orticosteroids at 6[em space]months but not 12[em s pace]months, and there is evidence for supe of 0.03% and An u pdated Cochrane Re view still found no evidence of a benefit from any form of anti staphylococcal treatment in managing clinically infected or uninfected eczema. The evide nce base is poor for bath emollients, occlusive treatments (e.g., wet and dry wraps) and woven silk clothing in treating eczema. In general, the methods used in most systemati c reviews of eczema need to be reported more clearly , especially with regard to a m ore vigorous quality as sessment of included studies. In cluded studies are frequently h eterogeneous, proxy re porting is common, and appropriat e disease definitions are ofte n lacking. Better adhe rence to existing guidance on tr ial reporting and prospective r egistration of clinical tri als may help improve the quality of studies. 18 Resultat Tibosch MM, Verhaak CM, Merkus PJ FM. Psychological characterist ics associated with the onset and course of asthma in children and adolescents: a s ystematic review of lon gitudinal effects. Patient Educ Couns 2011;82(1):119. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: to systematically review all available stu dies that investigated the longitudinal relationships betwe en the psychological characteri stics of children and adolescents suffering from asthma and those of their caregivers , and the onset and course of the asthma., METHODS: relevant studies were identifie d using Medline, PubMed, and PsychINFO between 1 970 and September 2009., RESULTS : twenty studies matching inclusion criteria were reviewed. Six studies focused on childspecific psycho logical characteristics in relat ion to the onset and course of asthma. No compelling evi dence was found for an association with asthma onset, but there was some evidence that the child's psychological characteristics can contribute t o the subsequent course of asthma. Fourteen studies consider ed the effects of the psycholo gical characteristics of the caregivers. Eleven studies f ound significant relationships between the psychologi cal problems of caregivers and t he subsequent onset and unfavor able course of the asthma in the child., CONCLUSION: in pediatric asthma both the psychological characte ristics of the affected children and their caregivers appear to contribute to the course and possibly also to the onset of the condition. Upchurch S, Harris JM, Cullinan P. Temporal changes in UK birth order and the preva lence of atopy. Allergy 2010;65(8):103941. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Many studi es have reported an inverse ass ociation between birth order and the risk of resp iratory allergic disease. In re cent decades, the preva lence of atopy has increased alo ngside reductions in fertility rates., AIMS OF THE STUDY: To quantitate how much of the increased prevalence of at opy, measured by skin prick test or specific IgE, can be attributed to temporal changes in family size in the United Kingdom., METHODS: Thr ough a systematic literature r eview (MEDLINE, 19652009), five studies of UK po pulations were identified and their data were in cluded in the calculation of a summary odds ratio for the risk of atopy for each birth order. Information on changes in UK family sizes between 1960 a nd 2001 was obtained from Eurostat. On this basis, ex pected increases in the prevale nce of atopy were calcu lated by weighting the proporti on in each birth order category for 1960 and 2001 by the summary odds ratio for that category and then calculating t he relative risk of atopy in 2001 compared with 1960., RESULTS: The pooled summary odds r atios for atopy were 0.90, 0.69 and 0.69 for those born second, third and fourt h (or higher), respec tively. The expected relative in crease in the prevalence of ato py resulting from a change in family size between 1960 and 2001 was 3%., CONCLUSION S: Despite the strong associations between birth order and atopy, reductions i n family size in the last 40 years account for little of the increase in atopy Williams HC, Grindlay DJC. What's new in atopic eczema? An anal ysis of systematic re views published in 2007 and 2008. Part 2. Disease prevention and treatment. Clin Exp Dermatol 2010;35(3):2237. Abstract: This review summarizes clinically important findings from systematic re views indexed in bibliographical databases between August 2007 and August 2008 that dealt with disease prevention (s ix reviews) and treatment of at opic eczema (seven re views). Regarding disease preven tion, two independent systemati c reviews found some clinical trial evidence that inge stion of probiotics by mothers during pregnancy might reduce the incidence of subseque nt eczema. Anothe r review faile d to find any clear benefit of prebiotics in eczema prevention. Although furry pets are often cited as caus 19 Resultat ing allergic disease, a systematic review of observational stud ies found no evidence that exposure to cats or dogs at birth increases eczema risk. O ne very large review of studies of breastfeeding found some evidence of a protective ef fect on eczema risk, al though all the studies were limit ed by their obse rvational natu re. A German group has attempted an overview of eczema prevention studies with a view to informing national guidelines. In terms of eczema treatment, two systematic review s have confirmed the efficacy of topical tacrolimus oi ntment. Another review of 31 t rials confirms the effica cy of topical pimecrolimus, altho ugh many of those trials were vehicle controlled, which limits their clinical util ity. A review of 23 studies of desensitization therapy for allergic diseases found some evidence of benefit for eczema, wh ich needs to be ex plored further. Despite the popu larity of antistaphylococcal th erapies for eczema, a Cochrane Review of 21 trials fai led to show any clear benefit f or any of the therapies for infected or clinically noninf ected eczema. Another Cochrane Review dealt with die tary exclusions for people with eczema and found little evidenc e to support any dietary exclusion, apart from avoidance of eggs in infants with suspect ed egg allergy supported by evidence of sensitization. A r eview of 13 studies of probiot ics for treating estab lished eczema did not show convin cing evidence of a clinically worthwhile benefit, an observation that has been substantiated in a subsequent Cochran e Review Wu H, Romieu I, SienraMonge JJ, Li H, del RioNavarro BE, Lond on SJ. Genetic variation in ORM1like 3 3 (orosomucoid 1like 3, ORMDL3) as an asthma candidate gene. Sin gle nucleotide poly morphisms (SNPs) in the region including ORMDL3 on chromosome 1 7q21 were re lated to childhood asthma risk a nd ORMDL3 expression levels in Europeans., OBJEC TIVE: We examined whether polymorphisms in ORMDL3 and the adjac ent gasdermin like (GSDML) gene associated with asthma in the genomewide ass ociation study are related to childhood asthma and atopy in a Mexico City populati on., METHODS: We ge notyped rs4378650 in ORMDL3 and in GSDML in 615 nucle ar families con sisting of asthmatic children ag ed 417 years and their parents . Atopy was determined by skin prick tests to 25 aeroa llergens., RESULTS: Individuals carrying the C allele of rs4378650 or the T alle le of rs7216389 had increased risk of as thma [relative risk (RR) = 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.192.53, P = 0.003 for o ne or two copies of rs4378650 C, and RR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.122.38, P = 0.009 for one or two copies of rs7216389 T). Linkage disequilibrium between the two SNPs was h igh (r(2) = 0.92). Neither of the SNPs was associated with the degree of atopy. A metaanalysis of five published studies on rs7216389 in nine populations gave an odds ratio for asthma of 1.44 (95% CI, 1.351.54, P < 0.00001)., CONCLUSIONS: Our result s and the meta analysis provide evidence to conf irm the finding from a recent genomewide associa tion study that polymorphisms in ORMDL3 and the adjacent GSDML may contribute to childhood asthma Zhang YG, Huang J, Zhang J, Li X B, He C, Xiao YL, et al. RANTES gene polymorphisms and asthma risk: A metaanalysis. Arch Med Res 2010;41(1):508. Abstract: RANTES is a chemokine that assis ts the recruit ment of inflammatory cells including eosinophils. Previous stud ies revealed that poly morphisms of RANTES were implica ted in susceptibility to asthma , but a large number of studies reported apparently c onflicting results. We performe d a metaanalysis to in vestigate the association of the se polymorphisms and asthma ris k., METHODS: Litera turebased metaanalysis was su pplemented by tabular data from investigation of all 20 Resultat relevant studies regarding all po lymorphisms of RANTES availabl e before November 30, 2009, with investigation on potential sources of heterogene ity., RESULTS: Ten case/control studies were include d in the metaanalysis, involv ing a total of 1706 cases and 1685 controls. In a combined analysis, no significant assoc iations with asthma risk were found on these two polymorp hisms (403G/A and 28C/G) with For the 403G/A polymo rphism, in subgroup analysis b y ethnicity, no signifi cant associations were found in Asians, Europeans or AfricanAm ericans; in subgroup analysis by age, no significant associations were found in adul ts or children. In sub group analysis by atopic status, the 403G/A polymorphism was s ignificantly asso ciated with asthma risk in atopic asthma (dominant model [OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.09 1.76, p = 0.009; P(het) = 0.10]; A vs. G model [OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.041.51, p = 0.02; P(het) = 0.11] and AG vs. GG model [OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.061. gene 403G/A poly morphism would be a risk factor among atopic asthma patients. T o further evaluate genetogene and genetoenvironment interactions on RANTES pol ymorphisms and asthma risk, more studies with thousands of patients are requir ed.

A m etaanalysis was per formed to investigate the associ ation between polymorphisms in the TGFbeta1 gene and asthma susceptibility., METH ODS: Searches were performed of Medline (Ovid), PubMed, the Chinese Biological Medicine Database (CBM), the Chi nese Journals Full text Database (CNKI), the Cochrane Library Database and the Web of Science, covering all papers published up to 30 Ap ril 2009. Statistical analysis was performed using Revman4.2.8 and STATA10.0 software., RESULTS: Two polymorphisms (509C/T and 915G/C(G25C)) were investigated in 14 studies, involving 2979 a sthma patients and 4941 control subjects. The result s showed that individuals carr ying the 509T allele (TT+TC) had a 36% increased risk of asthma, with homozygotes ( 509CC) (OR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.121. 65). However, there was no sign ificant association with risk of asthma in carriers of the 915C allele (GC+CC) comp 95% CI: 0.651.70). In a subgroup analysis by ethnicity, the risk of asthma associated with the 509T allele was significantly eleva ted among Asians (OR 1.50, 95% CI: 1.042.17) but not Caucasians (OR 1.16, 95% CI: 1 .001.36). In a subgroup analysis by age, the 509T allele was associated with a signifi cantly elevated risk of asthma among adults (OR 1.45, 95% CI: 1.091.92) but not childr polymor phism in the TGFbeta1 gene may be a risk factor for asthma. To further evaluate gene gene and geneenvironment interactions between polymorphisms in the TGFbeta1 gene and asthma susceptibility, more studies involving thousand s of patients are re quired Zhang Y, Tian C, Zhang J, Li X, Wan H, He C, et al. The 159C/T polymorphism in the CD14 gene and n TNFalpha ge ne has been ex tensively investigated for associ ation to asthma; however, resu lts of different studies have been inconsistent. The aim of this study is to comprehensi vely evaluate the genet ic risk of 308 G/A polymorphism in TNFalpha gene for asthma., METHODS: A meta analysis was carried out to analyze the association between the 308 G/A polymor 21 Resultat phism TNFalpha gene and asthma risk., A total of 4717 cases and 5012 con trols in 29 casecontrol studies were included in this metaana lysis. The result indi cated that the variant A allele c arriers had a 38% increased ri sk of asthma, when com pared with the homozygote GG (odds ratio (OR)[THIN SPACE]=[THIN SPACE]1.40, 95% 1.68 for AA[THIN SPACE]+[THIN SP ACE]AG vs. GG).

The aim of this study is to investig ate the association between the 159C/T polymorphism in the CD14 gene and the risk of asthma by metaanalysis. We se arched Pubmed, Em base, CNKI database, Wanfang dat abase, Weipu database, and Chin ese Biomedical da tabase, covering all publications (last search been performed o n April 20, 2010). Statis tical analysis was performed by using the softwares Revman 4.2 and STATA 10.0. A to tal of 17 casecontrol studies in 17 articles (4,246 cases and 3,631 controls) were in cluded in this metaana lysis. There was no association between this polymorphism and asthma risk in combined analyses (odds ratio (OR)[THIN SPACE]=[ THIN C C). In the sub group analysis by age, ethnicity , and atopic status, no signifi cant associations of asthma risks were obtained from age gro ups, ethnic groups, and atopic groups for TC[THIN SPACE]+[THIN SPACE]TT vs. atopic population, significant de creased atopic asthma risks found that CD14 is a candidate gene for atopic asthma sus ceptibility.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is c onflicting evidence on whether BCG vaccination might represent an effective pri mary preventative strategy agai nst the development of allergic sensitization and disea se., OBJECTIVES: We sought to s ystematically review the relationship between BCG vaccinati on and the risk of sensitizat ion, eczema/atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinoconjun ctivitis, asthma, and other all ergic conditions, such as food allergy and anaphy laxis., METHODS: Four international data bases were searched for published epidemiologic or i nterventional studies. Addition al online study databas es were searched and vaccine man ufacturers and a panel of inter national experts were contacted in an attempt to locat e unpublished or ongoing studie s. Quality assessment was undertaken by using internat ionally established criteria. M etaanalyses were un dertaken by using fixed or rand omeffects modeli ng. Funnel plo ts were used to assess for the risk of publication bias., RESULTS: We identified 767 a rticles, of which 17 satis fied our inclusion criteria; there was only 1 randomized contro lled trial, with the re maining studies being epidemiolo gic investigations. Metaanalys es did not show any protective effect of vaccination against the risk of sensitizat ion, as judged by specific IgE tests (odds ratio [OR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.071.60) or skin pr ick testing 0.87; 95% CI, 0.671.13); the risk of atopic eczema/dermatitis (OR, CI, (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.8 91.28). BCG vaccination was associated with a protective effect against the risk of ast hma (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.560.95), although this might be explained by pu blication bia s., CONCLUSIONS: BCG vaccination is unlikely to be associated with protection agains t the risk of allergic sensi tization and disease. The observed possible benefit in relation to the development of asthma is unlikely to be due to allergic sensitization. Demicheli V, Rivetti A, Debalini MG, Di Pietrantonj measles, are seri ous diseases that can lead to potentially fatal illness, disability and death. Ho wever, public debate over the safety of the trivalent MMR vaccine and the resultant drop in vaccination coverage in several countries persists, d espite its almost universal use and accepted effective ness., OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and adverse effe cts associated with the MMR vaccine in children up to 15 years of age., SEARCH METHODS: For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Re gister of Controlled Trials (CE NTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), which in cludes the Cochrane Acute Respi ratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, PubMed (July 2004 to May week 2, 2011) and Em base.com (July 2004 to May 2011)., SELECTION CRITERIA: We used comparative pros pective or retrospective trials assessing the effects of the MM R vaccine compared to placebo, do nothing or a combinat ion of measles, mumps and rube lla antigens on healthy individuals up to 15 years of age., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two re view authors independently extra cted data and assessed methodol ogical quality of the included studies. One review auth or arbitrated in case of disag reement., MAIN RE SULTS: We included five randomise d controlled trials (RCTs), on e controlled clinical 23 Resultat trial (CCT), 27 cohort studies, 17 casecontrol studies, five t imeseries trials, one case crossover trial, two ecological s tudies, six self controlled c ase series studies involving in all about 14,700,0 00 children and assessing effectiveness an d safety of MMR vaccine. Based on the available evidence, one MMR vaccine dose is at lea st 95% effective in pre venting clinical measles and 92% effective in preventing second ary cases among household contacts.Effectiveness of at least one d ose of MMR in preventing clinical mumps in children is estimated t o be between 69% and 81% for th e vaccine prepared with Jeryl Lynn mumps strain and between 70% and 75% for the va ccine containing the Urabe strain. Vaccination wi th MMR containing the Urabe str ain has demonstrated to be 73% effective in preventin g secondary mumps cases. Effect iveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR in preventing lab oratoryconfirmed mumps cases i n children and ado lescents was estimated to be bet ween 64% to 66% f or one dose an d 83% to 88% for two vaccine doses. We did not ide ntify any studies assessing th e effectiveness of MMR in preventing rubella.T he highest risk of association with asep tic meningitis was ob served within the third week after immunisation with Urabecont aining MMR (risk ra tio (RR) 14.28; confidence in terval (CI) from 7.93 to 25.71 ) and within the third (RR 22.5; 95% CI 11.8 to 42.9) or fifth (RR 15.6; 95% CI 10.3 t o 24.2) weeks after im munisation with the vaccine prepared with the LeningradZagreb strain. A significant risk of association with febrile seizures and MMR exposure duri ng the two previous weeks (RR 1.10; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.15) was assessed in one large persontime cohort study involving 537,171 children aged between three months and five year of age. In creased risk of febrile seizure has also been observed in child ren aged between 12 to 23 months (relative incidence (RI) 4.09; 95% CI 3.1 to 5.33) an d children aged 12 to 35 months (RI 5.68; 95% CI 2.31 to 13.97) within six to 11 days af ter exposure to MMR vaccine. An increased risk of thr ombocytopenic purpura within s ix weeks after MMR immunisation in children aged 12 to 23 months was assessed in o ne casecontrol study (RR 6.3; 95% CI 1.3 to 30.1) and in one small self controlled c ase series (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 5.38; 95% CI 2.72 to 10.62). Increased risk mbocytopenic purpura within six weeks after MMR exposu re was also assessed in one ot her casecontrol study involving 2311 children and adolescents between one month and 1 8 years (odds ratio (OR) 2.4; 95% CI 1.2 to 4.7). Exposure to the MMR vaccine was u nlikely to be associated with autism, asthma, leukaemia, hay fever, type 1 diabetes, gai t disturbance, Crohn's disease, demyelinating diseases, bacterial or viral infections. , AUTHORS' CONCLU SIONS: The design and reporting of safety outcomes in MMR vacci ne studies, both pre and postmarketing, are largely inadequate. The evidence of adv erse events following immunisation with the MMR vaccine cannot be separated from its role in preventing the target diseases Dewachter P, MoutonFaivre C. [A of ma nagement of the aller gic risk occurring during paedia tric anaesthesia., STUDY DESIGN : Literature analysis., METHODS: Literature research using the Medline((R)) database an d MeSH format ac cording to keywords, including p ublications in French and Engli sh since 1982., RE SULTS: The overa ll incidence for anaphylactic reactions was est imated at one in 7741 anaesthetic procedures during pa ediatric anaesthesia. Latex ana phylaxis was mostly involved with an incidence at one in 10,159 anesthetic procedur es. The risk factors of latex sensitization are known. P rimary latex prophylaxis is eff icient in patients at risk of latex sensitization. In contra st to adults, neuromuscular bl ocking agents (NMBAs) are rarely involved in children, with an incidence at 1 in 81,2 75 anaesthetic procedures. The Ring and Messmer clinical scale allows quantifying the seve rity and helps manag ing the care of immediate hypers ensitivity reactions. Clinical symptoms associate car diovascular, respiratory and cut aneousmucous signs according t o different severity grades. Epinephrine associated t o fluid loading, remains the fi rstline agent in case of 24 Resultat severe reactions. The allergological assessment is key to the m anagement of these reac tions and is required in order to identify the mechanism of the reaction and the culprit drug or substance involved., CONC LUSIONS: Allergic reactions to NMBAs occurring dur ing paediatric anaesthesia are r are whereas those with latex ar e more frequent. There fore, the reduction of the allergic risk during paediatric anae sthesia essentially requires a latexfree environment. Edmond K, Scott S, Korczak V, Wa rd C, Sanderson C, Theodoratou E, et al. Long term sequelae from childhood pneumonia; review and metaa nalysis. PloS 2012;7(2):e31239. Abstract: The risks of long term sequelae from chil dhood pneumonia have not been systematically asse ssed. The aims of this study w ere to: (i) estimate the risks of respiratory sequelae af ter pneumonia in children under five years; (ii) estimate the distribution of the different types of respiratory sequelae ; and (iii) compare seque lae risk by hospitalisation status and pathogen., METHODS: We s ystematically reviewed published papers from 1970 to 2011. Standard global burden of d isease categories (re strictive lung disease, obstruct ive lung disease, bronchiectasi s) were labelled as major sequelae. 'Minor' sequelae (chronic bronchitis, asthma, other a bnormal pulmonary function, other respiratory disea se), and multiple impairments were also included. Thirteen papers were selected fo r inclusion. Synthesis was by r andom effects meta analysis and metaregression., RE SULTS: Risk of at least one ma jor sequelae was 5.5% (95% confidence interval hospitalised chi ldren. Adenovirus risk [39. 270.5%]) but children hospita lised with pathogen isolated also had high risk (17. 6% [10.924.3%]). The most comm on type of major se was restrictive lung disea se (5.4% [2.510.2%]) . Potenti al confounders such as loss to follow up and median age at infection were not associat ed with sequelae risk in the final models., CONCLUSIONS: A ll children with pneumonia dia gnosed by a health professional should be considered at risk of long term sequelae .

A systematic review and me taanalysis of epi demiological studies. Int J Epidemiol 2010;39(2):46986. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Results ha ve been conflicting as to wheth er Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine, a nonspecific stimulator of the immune f unction, protects, pre disposes or is unrelated to the development of childhood asthma . In this systematic re view and metaanalysis, we quali tatively and quantitatively app raised the epidemiolog ical evidence., METHODS: Eligibl e studies were identified using a search strategy that included a computerized literatur e search and a manual search o f each article's refer ence list, up to June 2008. A total of 23 studies were included (10 cohort, 5 casecontrol and 8 crosssectional). Each study was summarized and rated for methodological quali ty. Pooled odds ratio (OR) estima tes and 95% confidence interva ls (CIs) were calcu lated using fixedeffects (FE) o r randomeffects (RE) models; i f heterogeneity was present, the latter was used. Th ree indicators of BCG exposure were considered includ ing BCG vaccination, tuberculin response and scar diameter., RE SULTS: The pooled es timate of association for 23 stud ies reporting on any of the th ree indicators suggested a protective effect of BCG expos ure on childhood asthma occurrenc e. The studies were heterogeneous, especially when tuberculin response was consider ed. Restriction to a subgroup of 16 studies that considered BCG vaccination indicate d a protective effect with no evidence of heterogeneit y. The overall pooled OR using an FE model was 0.86 25 Resultat (95% CI 0.790.93). Exclusion of three studies with the lowest quality scores showed a similar association., CONCLUSION: These results strengthen the epidemiological evi dence in support of the hypothesis that exposure to the BCG vac cine in early life pre vents asthma, possibly through a modulation of the immune matur ation process Etminan K , FitzGerald JM. Ace taminophen use and the risk of asthma in children and adults: a systematic review and metaanalysis. Chest 2009;136(5):131623. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Epidemiolo gic studies have identified an increased risk of asthma with acetaminophen use, b ut the results have been confli cting. We sought to quantify the association between acetaminophen use and the risk of asthma in children and adults., METHODS: We searched all the major me dical databas es, including MED LINE (from 1966 to 2008) and EMBASE (from 1980 to 2008) to iden tify pertinent ar ticles. All clinical trials and o bservational studies were cons idered. For observational studies, we selected those that clearly defined acetaminophen u se and asthma diagno sis. Study quality was assessed by two reviewers, and data were extracted into a spreadsheet. A randomeffects mod el was used to combine studies with asthma and wheezing among both children an d adults., RESULTS: Thirteen cro sssectional studies, four cohort studies, and two cas econtrol studies comprising 42 5,140 subjects were included in the review. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for asthma a mong subjects using acetaminophen was 1.63 (95% CI, 1.46 to 1.77). The risk of asth ma in children among users of acetaminophen in the ye ar prior to asthma diagnosis an d within the first year of life was elevated (OR: 1.60 [95% CI, 1.48 to 1.74] and 1.47 [95% CI, 1.36 to 1.56], re spectively). Only one study repo rted the association between hi gh acetaminophen dose and asthma in children (OR, 3.23; 95% CI, 2.9 to 3.6). There wa s an increase in the risk of asthma and wheezing with prena tal use of acetaminophen (OR: 1.28 [95% CI, 1.16 to 41] and 1.50 [95% CI, 1.10 to 2.05], respectively)., CONCLUSION S: The results of our review are consistent with an increase in the risk of asthma an d wheezing in both children and adults exposed to a cetaminophen.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Exposure to endotoxin has been widely inv estigated as a po tential factor for asthma and a ssociated symptoms in children w ith different results. To clarify a potential relationship, we performed the present meta analysis to integrate the results of studies examining the association of endotoxin e xposure with wheeze and asthma in children., METHODS: A search for relevant studies and reviews was con ducted in MEDLINE, Highwire, CIN AHL, and The Cochrane Library d atabases. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) with correspond ing 95% confidence interval (CI) for endotoxin expo sure and wheeze or asthma were retrieved and pooled to generate summary effect es timates in STATA 11.1., RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included in the metaanalysis. 26 Resultat The summary estimates suggested that endotoxin was positively a ssociated with wheeze in infants and toddlers (metaOR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.101.9 8), but negatively (metaOR: )., CONCLUSIONS: Based on the studies evaluated, endotoxin is a risk factor for wheeze in younger child ren, but a protective factor for asthma in older children.

Abstract: CONTEXT: The increasin g prevalence of childhood asthm a has been asso ciated with low microbial exposure as described by the hygiene hypothesis., OBJEC TIVE: We sought to evaluate the evidence of association between antibiotic exposure during pregnancy or in the first year of life an d risk of child hood asthma., METHODS: PubMed was systematically search ed for studies published betwee n 1950 and July 1, 2010. Those that assessed associat ions between antibiotic expos ure during pregnancy or in the first year of life and asthma at ages 0 to 18 years ( for pregnancy exposures) or ages 3 to 18 years (for firstye aroflife expos ures) were incl uded. Validity was as sessed according to study design, age at asthma diagnosis, adju stment for respiratory infections, and consultation rate s., RESULTS: For exposure in t he first year of life, the pooled odds ratio (OR) for all studies (N = 20) was 1.52 (95% c onfidence interval [CI]: 1.301.77). Retrospective studies had the highest pooled e stimate for asthma (OR: 2.04 [95% CI: 1.832.27]; n = 8) compared pro spective studies (OR: 1.25 [95% CI: 1.081.45]; n = 12) . Risk estimates for studies t hat adjusted for respirato ry infections (pooled OR: 1.16 [9 5% CI: 1.081.25]; n = 5) or l ater asthma onset (pooled OR for asthma at or after 2 years: OR: 1.16 [95% CI: 1.061.25] ; n = 3) were weaker but remained significant. For exposu re during pregnancy (n = 3 stud ies), the pooled OR was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.021.50)., CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics seem to slightly increase the risk of childhood asthma.

Infant antibiotic use and whee ze and asthma risk: a systematic review and metaanalysis. Eur Respir J 2011;38(2):295302. Abstract: Our aim was to systema tically review and metaanalyse longitudinal studies on antibiotic use and subsequent development of wheeze and/or a sthma with regards to study quality, outcome measur ement, reverse causation (RC; w heezing/asthma symptoms have caused on of antibiotics) and confoundi ng by indication (CbI; respiratory tract infections leading to antibiotic use may be t he underlying cause trig gering asthma symptom development). English language papers and studies published 27 Resultat before November 1, 2010 with longitudinal observational design were included. Study quality was assessed us ing the NewcastleOttawa scale. We ident ified 21 longitudinal studies. The effect of antibioti c use on wheeze/asthma risk var ied between studies. 18 studies were eligible for metaa nalysis showing pooled OR 1.27 (95% CI 1.121.43) for wheeze/asthma. When we eliminated studies with possible RC and CbI, the pooled risk estimate in the nine remaining studies was attenuated to OR 1.1 2 (95% CI 0.981.26). Definition of wheeze/asthma and a ge at followup differed betwe en studies. Three stu dies focused on wheeze/asthma bey ond 56 yrs of age with the pr esence of active symptoms and/or medication (pool ed OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.931.23; d ominated by one study). RC and CbI lead to overestimation of the association be tween antibiotic use and subsequent development of wheeze /asthma. Association was weak w hen fully adjusted for these types of bias. Heterogeneity of disease definition be tween studies could affect the results Shiotani A, Kamada T, Kusunoki H, Hata J, Haruma K. [Helicobact er infection and allergic diseases ]. Nippon Rinsho 2009;67(12):23526. Abstract: The prevalence of airw ay allergic diseases has increa sed in developed coun tries including Japan. There is a much published potential link between allergy and childhood infection. In 1989, Str achan proposed \"hygiene hypoth esis\" that infections and living in an unhygienic environment might prime the immune system and thus pro tect against the development of allergic diseases. H. pylori wo uld suppress allergic im munemediated inflammation throug h T helper type 1 (Th1)/Th2 pa radigm, which is suppression of Th2 responses by st imulation of Th1 immunity. In contrast, H. pylori infection has been associated wit h extradigestive pathologies including chronic idi opathic urticaria. Although systematic review demonstrated that eradication was asso ciated with remission of urticar ia, the association is still co ntroversial and the patho genic mechanisms have never been confirmed Thong BYH, Tan TC.

Abstract: The aim of t his review was to describe the current ev idencebased knowledge of the epidemiology, prevalence, incidence, risk factors and ge netic associations of drug allergy. Articles published betw een 1966 and 2010 were identifi ed in MEDLINE using the key words adult, adverse dru g reaction reporting systems, a ge factors, anaphylacto id, anaphylaxis, anaesthetics, a ntibiotics, child, nondepo St evens Johnson syndrome and toxi c epidermal necrolysis. Additional studies were identifie d from article reference lists . Relevant, peerreviewed original research articles, case series and reviews were consid ered for review. Current epidemiological studies on adver se drug reactions (ADRs) have u sed different defini tions for ADRrelated terminolog y, often do not differentiate i mmunologically and non immunologically mediated drug hyp ersensitivity, study different study populations (different ethnicities, inpatients or outpatients, adults or ch ildren), utilize different me thodologies (spontaneous vs. nonspontaneous reporting, cohort vs. casecontrol stu dies), different methods of assessing drug imputability and dif ferent methods of data analyses. Potentially lifethreat ening severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) are associated with a high risk of m orbidity and mortality. HLA ass ociations for SCAR asso ciated allopurinol, carbamaz epine have been r eported with the po tential for clinical use in screen ing prior to prescription. Id entification of risk factors for drug allergy and appropriate gene tic screening of atrisk ethni c groups may improve the outcomes of drugspecific SC AR. Research and collaboration are necessary for the 28 Resultat generation of clinicallyrelevant, translational pharmacoepidem iological and pharma cogenomic knowledge, and success of health outcomes research an d policies on drug allergies. protein infant formula of (AD) a mong healthy infants who received 100% whey protein partially hydrolyzed formula (PH FW) compared with intact protein cow's milk f ormula (CMF), has been reported in several studies. To validate these observations and estimate the magnitude of this potential association with greater statistical precisi on, we conducted a metaanalysi s of clinical trial and in tervention studies., MATERIALS AN D METHODS: A total of 18 artic les representing 12 independent study populations met our inclusion criteria., RESU LTS: A statistically sig nificant 44% (summary relative risk estimate [SRRE] = 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.400.77) reduced risk of atopic manifestations, which include d AD, was found among infants receiving PHFW compared with infants receiving CMF. In a subanalysis of 4 studies that reported results sp ecifically for AD and that were considered of superior methodological quality, the inci dence of AD was reduced by (SRRE = 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.300.70) ., of stu dy design, infant popu lation, followup time, or study location, individual study fin dings were consistent be cause a reduced incide nce of AD was reported in all of the revi ewed studies. Exclusive breastfeeding should be encourag ed as the standard for infant nutrition in the first months of life. For infants who are not exclusively breastfed, feeding with PHFW in stead of CMF reduces the risk of AD in infants, particularly in infants with a family his tory of allergy Anandan C, Nurmatov U, Sheikh A. Omega 3 and 6 oils for primary prevention of allergic disease: systematic review and metaanalysis. Allergy 2009;64(6):8408. Abstract: RECORD STATUS: This is a critical abstract of a syste matic review that meets the criteria for inclusion on DARE. E ach critical abstract contains a brief summary of the re view methods, results and conclu sions followed by a detailed cr itical assessment on the reliability of the review and the conclusions drawn AUTHOR'S OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of omega 3 a nd 6 oils in the primary prevention of sensitisation, eczema or atopic dermatitis, aller gic allergic disorders SEARCHING: Cochrane Ce ntral Register of Controlled Trials (CENT RAL), MEDLINE, EM BASE, LILACS, PsycINFO, AMED, an d Web of Science were searched and Google Scholar was used to search the Internet, with dates spanning from 1966 to 2008. The bibliogra phies of relevant studies were s canned for additional material. Unpublished and ongoing trials were sought from the meta Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the NRR. Manufacturers and field exp erts were also contacted for fu rther studies. There were no language restrictions 29 Resultat VALIDITY ASSESSMENT: Trial qua lity was assessed using the follo wing Cochrane criteria: allocation concealment, method o f treatment allocation, reporti of exclusions, com pleteness of followup, and repo rting of complications. Each pa rameter was scored as A (low risk of bias), B (moderate risk of bias), or C (high risk of bias), and an overall assess ment was recorded for each trial . The Jadad quality assessment tool was also used to as sess allocation concealment, blind ing, and withdrawals. Trials were scored from 0 (low quality) to 5 (high quality).Two independent reviewers assessed the quality of the in cluded trials DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extra cted to calculate relative risk s (RRs) and 95% confi dence intervals (CIs). This was carried out by one reviewer and checked by a second re viewer. Disagreements were resol ved by discussion, or by arbitr ation with a third review er RESULTS OF THE REVIEW: Six RCTs were included in the review (n= 938 participants). Four trials (n=679) compared omega 3, and two trials (n=259) co mpared omega 6, with placebo. A further eight ongoin g trials were found, the detail s of which were reported in the paper. Trial quality was scored A (Cochrane) and 5 (Jadad) in five trials; and B and 3 in one trial.The metaanalysis showed that there were no statistic ally significant benefits in favour of omega 3 or 6 supplementation on any outcome relating to eczema or atopic dermatitis, asthma, allergic rhi nitis, or food allergy. The res ults of other analyses were in consistent in the development of sensitisation to common allerg ens, with only one trial reporting a statistically signifi cant effect of omega 6 supplem entation on lowering serum immunoglobulin E levels (p<0.01) in atopic participants. Omega 3 supplementation was associated with statistically si gnificant benefits in immunolog ical response, but the effects were either short te rm or inconsistent AUTHOR'S CONCLUSION: Supplementa tion with omega 3, 6, or both w as unlikely to pre vent sensitisation or allergic disease CRD COMMENTARY: The review quest ion was clear and this was supp orted by potentially reproducible inclusion criteria. The search strategy included s ome relevant sources, and there were clear efforts to minimise language and publication b iases. The review process was conducted with sufficient at tempts to minimise error and bi as. An appropriate validi ty assessment was carried out, an d the results of this indicate d the high quality of the in cluded trials. Other study detail s were reported adequately, in cluding those for a number of ongoing trials. He terogeneity was asse ssed, and the chosen methods of synthesis ap peared to be appropriate.This was a wellconducted review and t he authors' conclusions appear to be reliable for the population under investigation IMPLICATIONS OF THE REVIEW FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: Research: The authors stated that future trials should build on the findings of this review, ensuring that mecha nistic, clinical, and health serv ice endpoints are considered.P ractice: The authors stated that omega 3 and 6 supplementation could not be recommended for the prevention of al lergic disease Batchelor JM, Grindlay DJC, Williams HC. What's new in atopic e czema? An analysis of systematic reviews published in 2008 and 2009. Clin Exp Dermatol 2010;35(8):8238. Abstract: This review summarizes clinically important findings from nine systematic reviews of the causes, treatment and prevention of atopic eczem a (AE) published be tween August 2008 and August 2009. Two systematic reviews concl uded that there is a strong and consistent association between filaggrin (FLG) mutat ions and development of eczema. FLG mutations and atopic se nsitization, rhinitis and asthma are weaker than between FLG mutations and eczema, es pecially if those who also have eczema are excluded. The relationship between tra nsforming growth factor levels in breast milk and eczema development is still un clear. A further systemat ic review found no strong evidence of a protective effect of ex clusive breastfeeding for at least 3 months against eczema, even in those with a positive family history of atopy. Based on a systematic review and metaanalysis of six randomize d controlled trials, 30 Resultat supplementation with omega3 and o mega6 oils is unlikely to pl ay an important role in the primary prevention of eczema or allergic diseases in gen eral. There is little evi dence to support dietary restric tions of certain foods in unsel ected children with AE. There is also little evidence t o suggest a clinically useful be nefit from using probiotics in patients with established eczema. A systematic review of top ical pimecrolimus and tacrolimus added little additiona l information to previous revi ews, and did not provide any new data on longterm safety. Both of these drugs work in A E, and may reduce flares and usage of topical cort icosteroids; however, there is still uncertainty about how they compare with topi cal corticosteroids.

Abstract: There is conflicting e vidence concerning the relation ship between breast feeding and wheezing illness. The objective of this study was t o investigate whether there is any association between breast feeding and wheezing in children aged over 5 years and to discover possible s ources of heterogeneity. An ele ctronic search of MED LINE and EMBASE databa ses was conducted from January 2000 to Ju ne 2010. In addi tion, reference lists from releva nt publications were searched. Birth cohort, cross sectional and casecontrol studie s were included if they measur ed any breast feeding or exclusive breast feeding for 3 or 4 months. Wheezing illness, i ncluding asthma, was identified based on symptoms, re ported diagnosis or objective c riteria. Thirtyone pub lications were identified for met aanalysis. There was no assoc iation found between any or exclusive breas t feeding and wheezing illness, although there was a high level of heterogeneity between the studie s. Subgroup analysis revealed t hat any breast feeding slightly lowers the odds of wheeze (pooled odds ratio 0.92 [0.8 6, 0.98]) but slightly in creases the odds of asthma defin ed by specific criteria (pooled odds ratio 1.10 [1.00, 1.22]). This metaanalysis does not provide evidence that breas t feeding is protective against wheezing illness in child ren aged 5 years and over.

Search the keyword \"pa cifiers\" present in ar ticles published in the last 5 ye ars that included abstract and were written in Portu guese, English, or Spanish., SU MMARY OF THE FINDINGS: There is evidence that their precursors have been used since the Neolithic Period to calm do wn children. Small balls made of fabric containing f ood were portrayed in painting s. Other balls made of nonperishable material persisted throughout time. Pacifiers ha ve been used to stimu late sucking or to coordinate th is reflex, promoting an earlier beginning of the oral feeding of newborns. Some author s suggest that pacifiers reduce the incidence of the sudden death syndrome, but the to pic is controversial. Pacifier s prevent the establish ment of breastfeeding and lead to weaning. Their use may cause suffocation, poisoning, or allergies and increases the risk of caries, infections, and intestinal parasitic diseases. Harmful effects are related to f requency, duration, and intensi ty of the habit. It should be discontinued by the age of 3 or 4 in order not to affect spe ech and dentition., CON CLUSIONS: There are more harmful effects than benefits. It is a dvisable that health pro 31 Resultat fessionals inform parents of the pros and cons of pacifiers so that they can make a con scious decision regarding its use Chafen JJS, Newberry SJ, Riedl MA, orp MJ, et al.

Abstract: CONTEXT: There is heightened interest in food allergi es but no clear consen sus exists regarding the prevale nce or most effective diagnosti c and management ap proaches to food allergies., OBJE CTIVE: To perform a systematic review of the available evidence on the prevalence, diagnosis, management, and preventi on of food allergies., DATA SOURCES: Electronic searches of PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Re views, Cochrane Database of Abst racts of Reviews of Effects, an d Cochrane Central Reg ister of Controlled Trials. Search es were limited to Englishla nguage articles indexed between January 1988 and September 2009., STUDY SELECTION: Diag nostic tests were included if they had a prospective, defined study population, u sed food challenge as a criterion standard, and reported sufficient data to calculate s ensitivity and specificity. Systematic reviews and randomize d controlled trials (RCTs) for management and pre vention outcomes were also used. For foods where anaphylaxis is common, cohort stu dies with a sample size of more than 100 participants were incl uded., DATA EXTRAC TION: Two investigators independe ntly reviewed all titles and a bstracts to identify po tentially relevant articles and resolved discrepancies by repea ted review and discus sion. Quality of systematic revie ws and metaanalyses was asses sed using the AMSTAR criteria, the quality of diagnosti c studies using the QUADAS cr iteria most relevant to food allergy, and the quality of RCTs using the Jadad criteria. , DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 12,378 citations were identifi ed and 72 citations were inclu ded. Food allergy affects more than 1% to 2% but less than 10% of the population. It is u nclear if the prevalence of food allergies is increasing. S ummary receiver operating cha racteristic curves com paring skin prick tests (area un der the curve [A UC], 0.87; 95% 0.91) to food challenge showed no statistical superiorit y for either test. Elimination diets are the mainstay of therapy but have been rarely studied. Immunotherapy is promisin g but data are insuf ficient to recommend use. In highrisk infants, hydrolyzed form ulas may prevent cow's milk allergy but standardized definitions of high risk and hydr olyzed formula do not exist., CONCLUSION: The evidence for the prevalence and managem ent of food allergy is greatly limited by a lack of uniformity for criteria for mak ing a diagnosis DelgadoNoguera MF, Calvache JA, Bonfill Cosp X. Supplementatio n with chain po lyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUF A) to breastfeeding mothers for improving child growth and development. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2010;(12):CD007901. Abstract: acids (L CPUFA), especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are the most abundant fatty acids i n the brain and are ne cessary for growth and maturation of the brain and retina. LCPU FA are named \"essen tial\" because they cannot be synthesised efficiently by the hum an body and come from maternal diet. It remains contro versial whether LCPUFA suppleme ntation to breast feeding mothers is beneficial fo r the developmen t of their infa nts., OBJECTIVES: To as sess the effectiveness and safe ty of supplementation with LCPUF A in breastfeeding mothers in the cognitive and physical development of their infa nts as well as safety for the mother and infant., SEARCH S TRATEGY: We searched the Cochra ne Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (November 2009), CENTRAL (20 09, Issue 2), PubMed (1966 to July 2009), EMBASE (1974 to June 2009), CINAHL (1984 to June 32 Resultat 2009), LILACS (1982 to June 2009), Google Scholar (June 2009) a nd reference lists of published narrative and systemati c reviews., SELECTION CRITERIA : Randomised con trolled trials or clusterrandomi sed controlled trials evaluati ng the effects of LCPUFA supplementation on breastfeeding mothers and their infants., DA TA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and trial quality and performed data extraction., MAIN RESULTS: We included six rando mised controlled trials involving 1280 women. We found no signific ant difference in children's neurode velopment: language development (standardised difference 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to trials, 349 partici pants); (two trials, 0.22, (SMD 0.34, CI 0.11 motor development (SMD 0.08, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.29; two trials, 349 participants); in child attention there was a sign ificant difference (SMD 0.50, 9 5% CI 0.24 to 0.77; one study). For child visual acuity there was no significant differ ence (SMD 0.06, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.14; three trials, 401 participants). For growth, ther e were significant differ ences in length (MD 0.75 cm, 95% CI 1.38 to 0.12; two trials , 834 participants) and head circumference (MD 0.69 cm, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.02; one trial, 244 participants). One study reported a significant dif ference in infan t allergy (risk ratio (RR) 0.12, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.95). We found no signif icant difference in one trial evaluating postpartum CON Based the limited evidence that we found, LCPUFA s upplementation did not appear to improve children's n eurodevelopment or visual acu ity. In two studies, LCPUFA supplementation was associated with increased head circu mference.

Br J Dermatol 2011;165(6):12809. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Exclusive b reastfeeding for at least 4 mo nths is recommended by many governments an d allergy organizati ons to prevent allerg ic disease., OBJEC TIVES: To investigate whether ex clusive breastfeeding protects against childhood ec zema., METHODS: Study subjects comprised 51,119 randomly select ed 8 to 12year old schoolchildren in 21 countri es. Information on eczema and b reastfeeding was ga thered by parental questionnaire. Children were also examined f or flexural eczema and underwent skin prick testing. O dds ratios (ORs) were calculated for each study centre and then pooled acro ss populations., RESULTS: There was a small increase in the risk of reported 'eczema ever' in association with 'breastfeeding ever' and breastfeeding < 6 months [pooled adjusted OR 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1 .001.22 and OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.021.20, respectively]. There was significant assoc iation between reported 'eczema ever' and breastfeeding > 6 months (pooled adjusted OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 1.26). Risk estimates were very similar for exclusive breastfee ding < 2 months, 24 months and > 4 months and for ecz ema symptoms in the past 12 mo nths and eczema on skin examination. As for more severe eczema, breastfeeding p er se conveyed a risk reduction on sleep disturbed ecz ema (pooled adjusted OR 0.71, 9 5% CI 0.530.96), but this effect was lost where child ren had been exclusively breast fed for > 4 months (pooled adjusted OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.671.54). Allergic sensitiza tion and a history of ma ternal allergic disease did not m odify any of these findings., CONCLUSIONS: Although there was a protective effect of ever having been breastfed on more severe disease, we found no evidence that exclusive breastfeeding for 4 months or longer protects against eczema. Our results are consiste nt with findings from a recent systematic review of 33 Resultat prospective studies. The U.K. br eastfeeding guidelines with reg ard to eczema should be reviewed. Intervention studies are now required to explore how and when solids should be introduced alongside breastfeeding to aid protection against eczema and other allergic diseases.

Evidencebased child health : a Cochrane review journal 2011;6(5):132239. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Eczema is the most common inflammatory sk in disease of childhood, characterized by an it chy red rash that usually invo lves the face and skin folds. There is currently no cura tive treatment for eczema, so the reduction of eczema incidence through disease preven tion is a desirable goal. Poten tial interventions eczema include exclusi ve breastfeeding, hydrolysed p rotein formulas and soy formulas when bottle feeding, maternal antigen avoidance, o mega oil supplementa tion, prebiotics and probiotics. OBJECTIVES: This overview of r eviews aims to present the current body of data from Coc hrane and nonCochrane reviews to provide the most uptodate evidence on the effica cy and safety of interventions to prevent eczema in infants and children at differen t risk levels for developing al lergic disease. METHODS: Our pool of Cochrane and nonCoch rane reviews came from the 201 0 United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) Evidence Skin Disorders Annual Ev idence Updates Map ping Exercise on Atopic Eczema. This group used a comprehensive search strategy last conducted in August 2010 to iden tify all systematic reviews on eczema prevention. We identified all reviews that met our prespecified inclusion cri teria, and data were ex tracted, analysed, compiled into tables and synthesized using q uantitative and qualita tive methods. MAIN RESULTS: Seven systematic reviews containing 39 relevant trials with 11 897 participants were in cluded in this overview. Overal l, there was no clear evidence that any of the main in terventions reviewed reduced ec zema incidence. In subgroup analyses of i nfants at high risk of allergic disease, an observational study found that exclusive breastfeeding for at least six months comp ared with introduction of solids at three to six months d ecreased the incidence of ecz ema by 60% 0.40; (CI): 0.21, and a ra ndomized controlled trial found that prebiotics compared with no 0.84). However, each of these findings was based on the results of a single small trial, and no interv ention reduced eczema incidenc e beyond the first two years of life. Although we pres pecified incidence of atopic ec zema with immunoglobulin E (Ig E) sensitization) as a primary outcome, data on whether participants diagnosed w ith eczema were truly atopic we re largely lacking from systematic reviews. Simila rly, data on atopy, measured usi ng skin prick tests or specific IgE tests to allergens, were not reported in many revi ews. No interventions were found to decrease atopy when reported. Adverse events data were generally lack ing, but data from a trial of pr obiotics versus no probiotics s howed significantly more spitting up in the first one (RR: 1.88; 95% CI: 1.03, 3.45) and two (RR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.02, 2.80) months of life, but no overall increase in risk of gastrointestinal symptoms in the first year. AUTHORS#ENTITYSTARTX02019; CONCLUSIONS: Alth ough there is currently no clear evidence showin g that any of the interventio ns examined in this overview prevent eczema in participants not selected for risk o f allergic disease, there is some evidence that exclusive breastfeeding for at least six months and prebiotics might reduce eczema incidence in highrisk participants. Howeve r, these conclusions are based on limited evidence with methodological shortcomings. Future research on prevention of eczema is needed and should examine different typ es of hydrolysed for mulas, prebiotics and probiotics , as well as enhancement of the skin barrier and other novel approaches in infants at di fferent risk levels for develo ping allergic disease 34 Resultat Greenhawt M. The role of food a (AD) affects ~10% of children. Food allergy is a known pro voking cause of AD in a subset o f affected child ren. A literatu re search of PubMed and Medline was conducted to review the epidemiology and pathophysi ology of AD, with special focus on the role of food allergy in the development of AD, its management, and its longterm preventive strategies. A literature search of Pub Med and Medline was conducted. Food allergens readily provoke AD in ~35% of patient s, as proven through doubleblind placebocontrolled food challenge studies. Milk, e gg, wheat, soy, and pea nut account for 75% of the cases of foodinduced AD. However, t he positive predictive values of the parental history, skinprick tests, or serum test s for detecting food specific IgE are low, making these unsuitable for use as single diagnostic modalities. Therefore, the use of a food challenge test is very helpful in objectively confirming the history or positive tests. Elimi nation diets are often helpful in challengeproven cases, but care must be taken to evaluate the nutritional status of th e child. There are few ef fective longterm strategies to prevent the development of food allergeninduced AD. Early onset of AD has been shown to be a risk factor for the de velopment of other aller gic diseases, including other f ood allergy/sensitization, as pa rt of the atopic march. Treatment of other causes of AD, such as barrier dysfunction an d cutaneous infection, are of equal importance to food allergen avoidance. Food allerg y is an important pro voking cause of AD, but it is only relevant in ~35% of affected individuals Ip S, Chung M, Raman G, Trikali nos TA, Lau J. A summary of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's evidence report on breastfeeding for He althcare Research and Quality's evidence report on the effects of breastfeeding on te rm infant and maternal health outcomes in developed cou ntries. EVIDENCE REPORT DATA SO URCES: Medline, biblio graphies of selected reviews, a nd suggestions from domain experts were surveyed. Searches were limited to English language publica tions. EVIDENCE REPORT REVIEW MET HODS: Eligible comparisons exa mined the as sociation between differential ex posure to breastfeeding and he alth outcomes. We as sessed 15 infant and six maternal outcomes. For four outcomes, we also updated pre viously published systematic rev iews. For the rest of the outco mes, we either summa rized previous systematic review s or conducted new systematic r eviews; randomized and nonrandomized comparative trials, prospective cohorts, and casecontrol studies were included. Adjusted estimate s were extracted from nonexper imental designs. The studies were graded for methodol ogical quality. We did not draw conclusions from poor quality studies. EVIDENCE R EPORT RESULTS: We screened over 9,000 abstracts. Thirtytwo primary studies on term infant health outcomes, 43 p rimary studies on ma ternal health outcomes, and 28 s ystematic reviews or metaanaly ses that covered ap proximately 400 individual studi es were included in this review . A history of breast feeding was associated with a reduction in the risk of acute ot itis media, nonspecific gastroenteritis, severe lower re spiratory tract infections, ato pic dermatitis, asthma (young children), obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, childhood leu kemia, and sudden infant death syndrome. There was no relationship between breastfeeding in term infants and cognitive performance. There were insufficient good quality dat a to address the rela tionship between breastfeeding an d cardiovascular diseases and infant mortality. For maternal outcomes, a history of lactation was associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, breast, and ovarian ca ncer. Early cessation of breast feeding or no breastfeed ing was associated with an incre ased risk of maternal postpartu m depression. There 35 Resultat was no relationship between a his tory of lactation and the risk of osteoporosis. The ef fect of breastfeeding in mothers on returntoprepregnancy weig ht was negligible, and the effect of breastfeeding on postpartum weight loss was uncle ar. EVIDENCE REPORT CONCLUSIONS: A history of breas tfeeding is associated with a re duced risk of many diseases in infants and mothers.

It took into c onsideration any relevant rand omized controlled trial which compared the use of PHFW with SF or EHF for the preventi on of allergies. The primary outcomes of interest were the incidence, cumulative inc idence and period pre valence of allergic man ifestations and of AD in particular. Fif teen studies had been in cluded for analysis of which six studies explored PHFW vs. EHF . These results and PHFW vs. SF data were adapted f or inputs into a pharmacoeconom ic model which used a spreadsheet decisionanal ytic economic model based on 3 month cycles to ex plore the costeffectiveness of P HFW vs. SF and EHF. Weights w ere applied to the inci dence rates and RRs for each reported time period which were th en adapted into 3 month indicators., RESULTS: This metaanalysis for PHFW (557 p atients) vs. EHF Whey (559 patients) yielded RR of 0.75 (0.54, 1.05) and 0.80 (0 .63, 1.02) at 012 months and at 036 months, resp ectively.

Atopy risk in infants and children in relation to early exposure to fish, oil y fish, or longchain omega 3 fatty acids: a systematic review. Clin Rev Allergy Immunol 2011;41(1):3666. Abstract: There are two main families of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), the n6 and the n3 families. It has been suggested that there is a cau sal relationship between n6 PUFA intake and allergic disease, and there are biologicall y plausible mechanisms, involving eicosanoid mediators of the n6 PUFA arachidonic acid , that could explain this. Fish and fish oils are sources of longchain n3 PUFAs an d these fatty acids act to oppose the actions of n6 PUFAs. Thus, it is considered that n 3 PUFAs will protect against atopic sensitization and against the clinical manifesta tions of atopy. Evidence to examine this has been acquired f rom epidemiologic studies inves tigating associations between fish intake in pregnancy, lactation, infancy, and child hood, and atopic out comes in infants and children and from intervention studies wit h fish oil supplements 36 Resultat in pregnancy, lactation, infancy , and childhood, and atopic out comes in infants and children. All five epidemiologic al studies investigating the ef fect of maternal fish intake during pregnancy on at opic or allergic outco mes in infants/chil dren of those pregnan cies concluded protective associat ions. One study investigating the effects of maternal fish intake during lactation did not observe any significant as sociations. The evidence from epidemiological studies inv estigating the effects of fish intake during infancy and childhood on atopic outcomes in those infants or children is in consistent, although the majority of the studie s (nine of 14) showed a protective effect of fish intake during in fancy or childhood on atopic out comes in those infants/children . Fish oil supplementa tion during pregnancy and lactati on or during infancy or childh ood results in a higher n3 PUFA status in the infants or children. Fish oil provision to pregnant women is as sociated with immunolog ic changes in cord blood and such change s may persist. Stu dies performed to date indicate that provision of fish oil duri ng pregnancy may reduce sensitization to common food alle rgens and reduce prevalence an d severity of atopic dermatitis in the first year of life, with a possible persisten ce until adolescence with a reduction in eczema, hay fever, and asthma. Fish oil provision to infants or children may be associated with immunologic changes in the blood but it is not clear if these are of clinical significance and whe ther they persist. Fish oil sup plementation in infancy may decrease the risk of developi ng some manifestations of alle rgic disease, but this benefit may not persist as other factors come into play. It is not clear whether fish oil can be used to treat children with asthma as the two studies co nducted to date give di vergent results. Further studies of increased longchain n3 PU FA provision in during pregnancy, lactation, and infancy are needed to more clearly id entify the immunologic and clinical effects in infants a nd children and to identify pr otective and therapeutic effects and their persistence Maas T, Kaper J, Sheikh A, Knottnerus JA, Wesseling G, Dompelin g E, et al.

Physician diagnosed asthma in children less than five years, and asthma as defined by respiratory symptoms and lung function criteria in chi ldren aged five years and olde r, both favoured treat ment with a multifaceted interve ntion compared t o usual care (< 5 years: odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interv al (CI) 0.54 to 0.96, and > 5 y ears: OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.85). However, there was no significant difference in outcome between mono 37 Resultat faceted intervention and control interventions (< 5 years: OR 1 .12, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.64, and > 5 years: OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.16). Indirect comparis on between these treatments did not demonstrate a significant difference between multiple interventions and monointerventions in reducing the frequency of asthma diag nosis in children un der five years (relative OR 0.64 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.04, P = 0.07 ) or five years and older (relative OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.35 t o 1.13, P = 0.12). There was al so no significant differ ence between either mono and multifaceted intervention and con trol in reducing the likelihood of symptoms of nocturn al coughing at follow up. Whee zing, however, showed a significant difference between multifaceted and monoi nterventions (relative OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.99, P = 0.04), but the significance w as lost when data on treatment only was analysed., AU THORS' CONCLUSIONS: The availab le evidence sug gests that the reduction of exposure to multiple allergens comp ared to usual care re duces the likelihood of a current diagnosis of asthma in childr en (at ages < 5 years and 5 years and older). Monointerve ntion studies have not produced effects which are sta tistically significant compared with control. In children who a re at risk of developing childhood asthma, multifaceted in terventions, characterised by dietary allergen reduc tion and environmental remediati on, reduce the odds of a physic ian diagnosis of asth ma later in childhood by half. This translates to a number need ed to treat (NNT) of 17. The effect of multifaceted inte rventions on parent reported wh eeze was inconsistent and had no significant impact on nocturnal coughing or dyspnoea . Data from monofa ceted intervention exposed child ren studies were not significan tly different from those of control groups for all outcom es. There remains uncertainty a s to whether multiple interventions are more effective than monocomponent interventi ons. The compari sons made were indirect, making the conclusions drawn uncertain . To our knowledge there are no ongoing stu dies in which both intervention strateg ies are randomly com pared. The findings, however, wa rrant further direct comparison between multiple and monofaceted interventions aim ed at reducing the prevalence of asthma in children Mulloy A, Lang R, O'Reilly M, Sigafoos J, Lancioni G, Rispoli M .

Abstract: RECORD STATUS: This is a critical abstract of a syste matic review that meets the criteria for inclusion on DARE. E ach critical abstract contains a brief summary of the re view methods, results and conclu sions followed by a detailed cr itical assessment on the reliability of the review and the conclusions drawn AUTHOR'S OBJECTIVES: To investig ate the effects of glutenfree and/or caseinfree (GFCF) diets in the treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) SEARCHING: Englishlanguage peer reviewed studie s were identifi ed through a search of PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavio ural Sciences Collection, ERIC and MEDLINE. Search terms were reported. Search dates were not reported (the author s stated that publication year was not restricted). Journa ls that had published studies s elected for review were handsearched from 2008 to March 2009 VALIDITY ASSESSMENT: Methodologi cal quality was evaluated to as sess level of certainty according to criteria of blindin g, adequate interobserver agre ement and treatment fideli ty measures (20% or more of sessi ons with 80% or better agreeme nt), operationally de fined dependent variables, enough detail to enable replication, limitations regarding con trols against alternative explan ations for treatment outcomes ( such as maturation, con current interventions, problems with construct validity). Studi es were classified as sug gestive (included uncontrolled tr ials), preponderant (outcomes were assessed to be likely due to the intervention) and conclusive.The authors did not sta te how many reviewers performed the va lidity assessment DATA EXTRACTION: Data on behavioural or biomedical variables we re extracted into standard data extraction forms. Behavioural vari ables included communication (such as nonverbal communication, asking), stere otypy, play and challeng 38 Resultat ing behaviour (such as pica, sel finjury, aggression and proper ty destruction). Biomedical variables included levels of urinary peptides, relevant enzymes and antibodies. Results were coded as positive where all participants made improvements and there were statis tically significant differences between groups, negative where none of the participants made improvements or if there we re no statistically significant differences between groups and mixed where some part icipants improved and others di d not.Percentage of nonoverlapping data (PND) was cal culated for singlesubject de signs. Repeated measures effect sizes were calculated for group designs. Repeated measur es effect sizes were cor rected for bias according to the technique developed by Hedges and Olkin.One reviewer extracted data, which were check ed by a second reviewer. Discre pancies were resolved through discussion RESULTS OF THE REVIEW: Fourteen studies (n=188) were included i n the review. Sample sizes ranged from one to 50 participants. Overall study quality was poor; all studies that reported positive results were classified at the lowest level o f certainty (suggestive). All studies at the second level (prep onderant) reported negative re sults. None of the re viewed studies were assessed as c onclusive. Seven studies repor ted positive results and four reported negative results, two reported mixed results and in one study the effect of the intervention could not be det ermined.Quantitative summary o f results was possible for four studies. Two of the three singlesubject studies repor ted data. PND values were 0% and 3%. Two of the nine groupdesign studies reported data f or which repeated measures effect sizes could be e stimated for several dependent variables. Diet treatments were observed to have effect siz es of 1.80, and 0.82 on parti cipants\u00e2\u20ac level of urinary peptides AUTHOR'S CONCLUSION: Evidence di d not support use of glutenfre e and/or caseinfree diets in the treatment of ASD CRD COMMENTARY: This review addr essed a clear question supporte d by appropriate inclusion criteria. Relevant data bases were searched. The restr iction to Englishlanguage studies may have contributed to language bias. One database (ER IC) included unpublished studies. Publication bias was not considered in the report. Sui table methods to minimise risk of reviewer error and bias were reported for study selecti on and data extraction, but not for validity assessment. Resul ts were pooled narratively su pported by a table. A tho rough discussion of potential bia ses and sources of heterogenei ty was reported.A basic (vote counting) synthe sis was conducted, bas ed on whether resul ts were positive, nega tive or mixed. Details of study designs (such as number and typ e of groups) and results of individual studies were poorly r eported for most studies and fe w numbers, confidence intervals or pvalues were prese nted, which made it difficult t o evaluate the individual results. However, it appeared cle ar that the studies had very s mall sample sizes and were of poor quality, so the authors' conclusions appear appropriate in reflecting the limited evidence IMPLICATIONS OF THE REVIEW FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: Practice: The authors suggested that restrictive diets should be implemented only whe re a food allergy or into lerance was detected. The author s suggested that should a child with ASD experience acute behavioural changes seemin gly associated with changes in diet, practitioners should consider testing the child for a llergies and food intolerances and subsequently eliminate identified allergens and irritant s from their environment.Resea rch: The authors suggested controlled trials to determine wh ether a GFCF diet had any addi tional therapeutic benefit for individual children with ASD Nagel G, Weinmayr G, Kleiner A, GarciaMarcos L, Strachan DP, I SAAC Phase Two Study Group. Effect of diet on asthma and allergic sensitisation in t he International Study on Allergies and Asthma in Childhood (ISAAC) Phase Two. Thorax 2010;65(6):51622. Abstract: BACKGROUND: The increas ing prevalence of asthma and a llergy might be re lated to diet, particularly in We stern countries. A study was u ndertaken to assess the 39 Resultat association between dietary factors, asthma and allergy in a la rge international study including objective measurements of atopy., METHODS: Between 19 95 and 2005, crosssectional studies were performed in 29 centres in 20 coun tries. Parental ques tionnaires were used to collect i nformation on allergic disease s and exposure factors and data from 50 004 r andomly selected schoolchildren (812 yea rs, 29 579 with skin prick testing) were analysed. Random effect models for metaana lysis were applied to calculate combined ORs ., RESULTS: Fruit intake was associated w ith a low prevalence of current wheeze in affluent (OR(adj) 0.86, 95% CI 0.71, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.88). in affluent countries (OR(adj) 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0. 97) and of green vegetab les in nonaffluent countries (OR(adj) 0.78, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.95) was associated wi th a lower prevalence of current wheeze. Overall, more frequent consumption of fruit, vegetables and fish was associated with a lower lifetime prevalence of asthma, whereas high burger consump tion was associated with higher l ifetime asthma prevalence. Non e of the food items was associated with allergic sensitisation. Except for fruit juice and fruit consumption, no associations were found with atopic wheeze. Food selection acco rding to the 'Mediterranean diet' was associated with a lower prevalence of current wheeze and asthma ever (p(trend)=0.03)., CONCLUSION: Diet is associated wi th wheeze and asth ma but not with allergic sensiti sation in children. These resul ts provide further evi dence that adherence to the 'Mediterranean diet' may provide so me protection against wheeze and asthma in childhood Noal RB, Menezes AMB, Macedo SEC , Dumith SC. Childhood body mas s index and risk of asthma in adolescence: a systematic review. Obes Rev 2011;12(2):93104. Abstract: Asthma and obesity, bo th of which are considered glob al health issues, affect approximately 300 million individ uals worldwide. The observatio n that asthma and obesity tend to increase in para llel may indicate a potential l ink between these two conditions. The aim of this syst ematic review of the literature was to investigate the relationship between childhood nutritional status and incidence or persistence of asthma during adolescence. The p rincipal eligibility criteria f or selection of articles were including longitudinal anal ysis, and which measured of exp osure during child hood or adolescence an d outcome during adole scence. The systema tic search initially returned 1563 unique articles. A fter inspection of titles and r eading the abstracts of these articles, we chose 27 for f ull reading. Of these, 10 were selected to be included in the present review. Of the 10 selected studies, eight showed po sitive associations be tween overweight/obesity and asthma. Of these, two were indepen dent of sex, three were found only among men and an other three only among women. T he present study shows strong evidence that, although the role of sex is not cle ar, obesity precedes, and is associated with, the persistence and intensity of symptoms o f asthma Nurmatov U, Devereux G, Sheikh A. Nutrients and foods for the p rimary prevention of asthma and allergy: systemati c the nutrients selenium; zinc; vitamins A, C, D , and E; and low fruit and vege table intake may be asso ciated with the development of a sthma and allergic disorders., OBJECTIVES: To investi gate the evidence that nutrient and food intake modifies the ri sk of children developing allergy., METHODS: We systematic ally searched 11 databases. Stu dies were critically ap praised, and metaanalyses were undertaken., RESULTS: We identi fied 62 eligible reports. There were no randomized controlle d trials. Studies used cohort (n = 21), casecontrol (n = 15), or crosssectional (n = 26) designs. All studies were ju dged to be at moderate to substantial risk of bias. Metaa nalysis revealed that serum vit amin A was lower in child 40 Resultat ren with asthma compared with controls (odds ratio [OR], 0.25; 95% CI, 0.100.40). Meta analyses also showed that high maternal dietary vitamin D and E intakes during pregnan cy were protective for the devel opment of wheezing outcomes (OR , 0.56, 0.73; and OR, 0.68, 95% CI, 0.520.88, respectively). Adherence to a Mediterranean diet was protective for persistent wh eeze (OR, 0.22; 95% 0.55; 95% CI, 0.310.97). Seventeen of 22 fruit and vegetable studies reported beneficial associ ations with asthma and allergic outcomes. Results were not supp ortive for other allergic outcomes for these vitamins or n utrients, or for any outcomes i n relation to vitamin C and selenium., CONCLUSION: T he available epidemiologic evidence is weak but nonetheless supportive with respect to vitami ns A, D, and E; zinc; fruits a nd vegetables; and a Mediter ranean diet for the prevention of asthma. Experimental studies of these exposures are now warranted. Oddy WH, Rosales F. A systematic review of the importance of mi lk TGFbeta on immu nological outcomes in the infant and Pediatr Allergy I mmunol 2010;21(1 Pt 1):4759. Abstract: Cytokines in milk like transforming growth factorbet a (TGFbeta) have been shown to induce oral tolerance in experimental animal studies. However, human stu dies are less consistent with th ese findings. The primary objec tive of this review was to conduct a systematic review of published studies on the associa tion between TGFbeta identified in human milk and imm unological outcomes in infancy and early childhood. Human prospective clinical studie s were identifie d through MEDL INE, CAB Abstracts, Biological Abstracts and Scopu s. Selection criteria included: w ell described populations of mothers and infants, time of milk sampling, immunological ou tcome measures and analytical methods of TGFbeta d etermination. We considered a w ide range of immuno logical outcomes in infancy and early childhood, such as wheeze , atopy, eczema and the immunoglobulin switch. Twelve human studies were included in th e review and 67% showed a positive association with TGFbeta1 or TGFbeta2 demon strating protection against allergyrelated outcomes in infancy and early childhood . High variability in concentrations of TGFbeta was noted between and within studies , some of it explained by maternal history of atopy or by consumption of probiotics. H uman milk TGFbeta appears to be essential in devel oping and maintaining appropria te immune responses in infants and may provide prote ction against adverse immunolog ical outcomes, corro borating findings from experimen tal animal studies. Further lar ge clinical studies in diverse human populati ons are indicated to confirm these result s. Pelucchi C, Chatenoud L, Turati F , Galeone Bach JF, et al. Probiotics supple mentation during pregnancy or in fancy for the prevention of ato pic dermatitis: a meta analysis. Epidemiology 2012;23(3):40214. Abstract: BACKGROUND: The study of probiotics to prevent allerg ic conditions has yielded conflicting results in c hildren. We unde rtook a metaan alysis of randomized controlled trials to investigate whether probiotic use during p regnancy and early life decreases the incidence of atopic dermatitis and immunoglobulin E (IgE)associated atopic dermatitis in infants and young children., METHODS: We p erformed a systematic literature search in Medline, Emb ase, and Cochrane Library, upd ated to October 2011. The intervention was diet supplementation with probiotics versu s placebo. Primary outcomes were incidence of atopic dermatitis and IgEassociated atopic dermatitis. We calculated summary relative ris ks (RRs) and corresponding 95% c onfidence intervals (CIs), using both fixed and randomeffects models. We computed summary estimates across several strata, including study period, type of patient, dose, and duration of in tervention, and we assessed the risk of bias within and across trials., RESULTS: We identified 18 publications based on 14 studies. Metaanalysis d emonstrated that probi 41 Resultat otic use decreased the incidence of atopic dermatitis (RR = 0.7 9 [95% CI = 0.710.88]). Studies were fairly homogeneous (I = 24.0%). The corresponding RR of IgEassociated atopic dermatitis was 0.80 (95% CI = 0.660.96). No appreciable difference emerged across strata, nor was there evide nce of publication bias., CON CLUSIONS: This meta analysis provided evidence in support of a moderate role of pro biotics in the preven tion of atopic dermatitis and IgE associated atopic dermatitis in infants. The favorable effect was similar regardless of the time of probiotic use (pre gnancy or early life) or the subject(s) receiving probiotics (mother, child, or both) Schneider Chafen JJ, MA, Bravata Suttorp et al.

Abstract: RECORD STATUS: This is a critical abstract of a syste matic review that meets the criteria for inclusion on DARE. E ach critical abstract contains a brief summary of the re view methods, results and conclu sions followed by a detailed cr itical assessment on the reliability of the review and the conclusions drawn AUTHOR'S OBJECTIVES: T o assess the prevalen ce, diagnosis, manag ement and prevention of food allergies SEARCHING: PubMed, Cochrane Data base of Systematic Reviews, DAR E and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Tr ials (CENTRAL) were searched b etween 1988 and Sep tember 2009 for articles in Engli sh. Search terms were reported . The World Allergy Orga nisation Journal was searched between 1988 and February 2009. O ther potentially rele vant articles were ide ntified through search ing references and contacting experts (this could yield studies from o utside the search period) VALIDITY ASSESSMENT: Diagnostic studies were asse ssed using QUA DAS criteria. Ran domised controlled trials (RCTs ) of management were assessed us ing the Jadad scale. Ob servational studies on management of allergies were initially c onsidered to be of poor quality, but were then rated as good quality if there was a hig h level of followup (\u00e2\u00a590%), large sample size (>50 0 patients) and attempted to re duce bias through study design or statistical anal ysis.The authors did not state how many reviewers per formed the validity assessment DATA EXTRACTION: For diagnostic studies, sensitivities and spec ificities were extracted to calculate the summary receive r operator characteristic (ROC) curves, weighted by sample size, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). It was unclear how many reviewers were involved in data extraction, but discrepancies were resolved th rough discussion or by re ferral to a third reviewer RESULTS OF THE REVIEW: Diagnosti c studies (18 prospective studi es, n=2,806):Sample sizes ranged between 34 and 495 children. Study quality was rep orted to be fair; between 11 and 18 studies met 10 of the 12 QUADAS criteria.There were n o statistically significant differences between skin prick te sts compared with food challen ge (AUC 0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to or tests ared food challenge (AUC 0.84, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.91; 11 studies) for all food allerg ies. There were no statistical ly significant differences for c ow\u00e2\u20acs milk allergy (AUC 0.84, 95% CI: 0.75 to skin prick studies and AUC 0.78, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.86; nine serum and hen\u00e2\u20acs egg allergy (AUC 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.97 ; five skin prick test stu dies and AUC 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; five serum foodspecifi IGE test stu dies).Management studies (25 stu dies, n=2,006):Sample sizes ran ged between 12 and 567. Overall, studies were reported to be of fair quality (seve n good, 12 fair and six poor).Studies of oral or subcuta neous immunotherapy reported so me improvement on desensitisation compared with controls, but there was insuffici ent evidence on tolerance and safety (five studies). There was insufficient evidence from studies on food substitu tions (three studies) or alterati ons (five studies) to make def initive conclusions. There was evidence that medical or pharmacologic therapies can improv e management of aller 42 Resultat gies (five studies). One study e ach assessed elimination diets and low allergen diets and reported improvements in allergie s compared with controls. One study reported reduced nut reactions after education. T wo studies reported no improvem ent on outcomes in in fants who received probiotics AUTHOR'S CONCLUSION: Conclusions a bout best practices for manag ement and preven tion of food allergies were greatly hindered by a lack of unifo rmity of criteria for making a diagnosis CRD COMMENTARY: The review question was broad and was supported by appropriate inclusion criteria for study desi gn and broad criteria for inte rvention, comparator, partic ipants and outcomes. The literat ure search was adequate, but as articles were restricted to English it was possible that language bias may have been int roduced. Previously pub lished criteria were used to asse ss study quality, which was de scribed as fair for both di agnostic and management studies. The authors undertook screenin g and data extraction in duplicate; it was not clear w hether this was true for validi ty assessment, which meant that reviewer error and bias cou ld not be ruled out. No formal tests of statistical hetero geneity were reported, but where heterogeneity was deemed to be present a narrative synthesis was appropriate. The a uthors acknowledged limitations with the included stu dies, such as their quality and heterogeneity in definitions of food allergy. The authors ac knowledged that they did not for mally evaluate for publication bias. There were few de tails reported on participants i n the management studies. Only a small number of studies were included for some comparis ons. Given the limitations with the available evidence, the authors\u00e2\u20ac conclusions seem a ppropriate, but interpretation should take into ac count potential limitations with the review process IMPLICATIONS OF THE REVIEW FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: Practice: The authors stated that there was a need for standard criteria to define a food allergy and a set of evi dencebased guidelines from whic h to make a diagnosis.Research: The authors stated that there was a need for greater rigour in the design, execution an d reporting of food allergy studies. There was a need for m ore controlled studies that asse ssed elimination diets in patients with nonanaphylactic food allergy symptoms Szajewska H, Horvath A. Metaana lysis the evidence for hydrolyzed 100% whey formula for the Med Res Opin 2010;26(2):42337. Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Infants wit h a documented hereditary risk of atopy (i.e., an af fected parent and/or sibling) who cannot be breastfed exclusive ly are recommended to receive a formula with confirmed reduced allergenicity, i.e., a partially or extensively hydrolyzed formula (pHF and eHF, respectively), as a means of p reventing allergic reactions. The efficacy of each hydrolyzed formula for the prev ention of allergic diseas es should be established separat ely, as factors such as the pro tein source, hydrolysis method and degree of hydrolysis that often depend on the manufa cturer contribute to differences among hydrolysates. The aim was to systematically r eview data on the effi cacy of a partially hydrolyzed 10 0% whey formula (pHF) in reduc ing the risk of allergy in healthy infants at high risk for allergy., METHODS: The Coch rane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases were searched in September 2009 (f rom inception to September 2009) for ra ndomized and quasirandomized controlled trials (RCTs); addi tional references were obtained f rom reviewed articles. The com pany that manufac tures the pHF used was contacted for unpublished data., RESULTS : The search yielded 84 citations. Fifteen RCTs were included, some of which had pot ential methodological limitations such as unclear or inadequate alloca tion concealmen t, no intentiontotreat analysis, and no true blinding. F or primary outcomes, i.e., all allergic diseases and atop ic eczema/atopic dermatitis, use of the pHF compared with stand ard formula (SF) was associated with reduced risks (i ncidence, cumulative incidence, period prevalence) that were statistically significant f or most, albeit not all, time p oints. Comparison of groups 43 Resultat who received the pHF versus extensively hydrolyzed (eH) whey fo rmula revealed no significant differences in outcom es except for reductions in th e cumulative incidences of all allergic disease s at 0 to 36 months of age. Comparison o f groups who received the pHF versus eH casein formula rev ealed no significant difference in outcomes between groups., CONCLUSIONS: The use of the pHF compared to SF is effe ctive in allergy pre vention in children at high risk for allergy at most time point s. These results should be interpreted with caution due to a lack of methodological rigor in many trials. Reassu ringly, the strongest evidence c omes from a cations on probio tics and prebiotics in allergic disease. It focuses on clinical studies of prevention or treatment of allergic d isease., RECENT FINDINGS: Studies sugges t a role for certain probiotics (alone or with prebiotics) in the prevention of atop ic eczema. Treatment during the prenatal pe riod appears to be im portant for benefici al effects. The use of probiotics for the treatment of established allergic disease is less promising, despite some positive results. A Cochrane systematic review concluded t hat, when the results for the different probiotic stra ins used in clinical trials are pooled, probiotics are not effective for the treatment of eczema. There are fewer studies of prebiotics for the treatment or prevention of allergic disease, but data suggest t hat prebioticsupple mented formulas may be effective for preventing eczema in infan ts at high risk of de veloping allergic disease when breastfeeding is not possible., SUMMARY: Allergic dis eases continue to increase in pre valence worldwide , and primary prevention of allergic disease has proved an elusive go al. Probiotic bacteria represen t the most promising intervention for primary prevention that has been studied to da te, and definitive inter vention studies should now be a research priority Thompson RL, Miles LM, Lunn J, Devereux Peanut sensitisa tion and allergy: influence of early life exposure to peanuts. Br J Nutr 2010;103(9):127886. Abstract: The aim of t he present systematic review was to evalu ate the influence of ear ly life exposure (maternal and childhood) to peanuts and the su bsequent development of sensitisation or allergy to p eanuts during childhood. Studie s were identified using electronic databases and bibliography searches. Studies that as sessed the impact of nonavoidance compared with avoida nce or reduced quantities of peanuts or peanut products on either sensitisation or allergy to peanuts, or both outcomes, were eligible. Six human studies were identifie d: two randomised controlled tr ials, two casecontrol studies and two crosssectional st udies. In addition, published animal and mechanistic studies, relevant to the question of whether early life exposur e to peanuts affects the subsequent development of peanut sensitisation, were reviewed n arratively. Overall, the evidence reviewed was heterogeneous, and was limited in qua lity, for example, through lack of adjust ment for potentially c onfounding factors. The nature of the evi dence has therefore hindered the development of definitive conc lusions. The systemat ic review of human studies and n arrative expertled reviews of animal studies do not provide clear evidence to suggest that either maternal exposure , or early or delayed introduction of peanuts in the diets of children, has an impact upon subsequent devel opment of sensitisation or allerg y to peanuts. Results from som e animal studies (and limited evidence from human subjects) suggest that the dose of peanuts is an important 44 Resultat mediator of peanut sensitisation and tolerance; low doses tend to lead to sensitisation and higher doses tend to lead to tolerance van der Aa LB, Heymans HS, van Aalderen prebiotics in atopic dermatitis: review of the theoretical background and clinical evidence.

Search terms wer e reported. Reference lists o f retrieved papers were reviewed VALIDITY ASSESSMENT: Quality of the included stud ies was assess ed with Dutch Institute for Health Care Improvement (CBO ) criteria, which graded studie s as: A2 for goodquality RCTs and B for poorer quality RCT s. The authors did not state h ow each quality compo nent was assessed.The authors di d not state how many reviewers assessed quality of the included studies DATA EXTRACTION: The effect of intervention on atopic dermatiti s incidence was com pared between intervention and c ontrol groups in a qualitative synthesis and with the Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) index for treatment studies. Odds ratio (OR) and ha zards ratio (HR), with confidence intervals (CI), and incidence rate were calculated from change in atopic dermatitis inci dence between pre and postint ervention periods. The authors did not state how many reviewers extracted the data RESULTS OF THE REVIEW: Eighteen studies were included: seven pr evention (n=2,197) and 11 treatment (n=712) studies that met the inclusion criteri a. Seven RCTs assessed prevention and 11 RCTs assessed tr eatment of atopic dermatitis, although the authors stated that 12 studies assessed tr eatment. Six of the seven stu dies that assessed preven tion were level A2 and one was level B. Seven of the 11 treatme nt studies were level A2 evidence. Results on use of probi otics in prevention of atopic dermatitis were mixed. One study reported a 50% r eduction in the incidence of atopic derma titis compared to placebo and another study showed no redu ction. One study showed that on ly one strain of probio tics reduced incidence of atopic dermatitis. Treatment of atopi c dermatitis with probiotics showed conflicting results: four studies demonstrated reduction of SCORAD score and three studies showed no effect o n atopic dermatitis, but did sh ow a significantly modest SCORAD with IgEassociated atopic dermatitis. The one dou bleblind RCT conducted so showed that incidence of atopic dermatitis was significa ntly lower in prebiotics group than group (9.8% versus 23.1%). A large propo rtion (>20%) of the in fants were lost to followup during the intervention period. Fo ur studies reported no ef fect on the severity of atopic d ermatitis in any group.The one study that investigated the use of synbiotics for the treatment of atopic dermatitis showed a significant improvement, but synbiotics did not appear to be superior to prebiotics alon e. Two studies that assessed the effect of probiotics on food allergies as a secondary outco me did not find any differ ence in incidence AUTHOR'S CONCLUSION: There was insufficient evidence in support of the use of probio tics, prebiotics or synbiotics for the prevention or treatment of atopic dermatitis in child ren in clinical practice CRD COMMENTARY: This review addr essed a clear research question . The search in cluded appropriate electronic da tabases. No appa rent attempts w ere made to retrieve un published studies, so some relev ant studies migh t not have been included. No information about data extraction was provid ed and errors could not be rule d out. The lack of multiple 45 Resultat reviewers raised concerns about t he potential for errors and bi as. Risk of bias in the in cluded studies could not be ruled out. Altho ugh potential sourc es of heterogeneity were explored qualitatively, this could not be addressed in the revi ew.

The re sults were compared with a meta analysis of published multicentre studies., RESULTS: A nnual concentrations of PM(10) at city level were ob tained for 105 ISAAC centres in 51 countries. After controlling for GNP per capita, there was a weak negative association between PM(10) and various outc omes. For severe wheeze in 1314yearolds, the O R for a 10 microg/ m(3) increase in PM(10) was 0.92 (95% CI 0.84 to 1.00). In 24 countries with more than one centr e, most summary esti mates for withincountry associations were weakly positive. For severe wheeze in 13 14yearolds, the summary OR fo r a 10 microg/m(3) increase in P M(10) was 1.01 (0.92 to 1.10). This result was close to a summary OR of 0.99 (0.91 t o 1.06) obtained from published multicentre studies ., CONCLUSIONS: Mo delled estimate s of particulate mat ter at city level are imprecise and incomplete estimates of per sonal exposure to am bient air pollutants. Neverthele ss, our results together with t hose of previous multi centre studies, suggest that urban background PM(10) has little or no association with the prevalence of childhood asth ma, rhinoconjunctivitis or ecze ma either within or be tween countries 46 Resultat Burke H, LeonardiBee J, Hashim A, PineAbata H, Chen Y, Cook D G, et al. Prenatal and passive smoke exposure and incide nce of asthma an d wheeze: syst ematic review and metaanalysis. Pediatrics 2012;129(4):73544. Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Exposure t o passive smoke is a common and avoidable risk fac tor for wheeze and asthma in chi ldren. Substanti al growth in th e prospective cohort study evidence base provides an opportunity to generate new and more detailed esti mates of the magnitude of the ef fect. A systematic review and m etaanalysis was con ducted to provide estimates of the prospective effect of smokin g by parents or house hold members on the risk of wheeze and asthma at different stag es of childhood., ME THODS: We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and conferen ce abstracts to identify cohort studies of the i ncidence of asthma or wheeze in relation to exposure to prenatal or postnatal maternal, paternal, or household smoking in subjects aged up to 18 years old. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence inte rvals (CIs) were esti mated by using random effects mo del., RESULTS: We identified 79 prospective studies. Exposure to pre or postnatal pa ssive smoke exposure was associ ated with a to 70% increased risk of incident wh eezing (stronges t effect from postnatal maternal smoking on wheeze in children ag ed <=2 years, OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.242.35, 4 stu dies) and a 21% to 85% increase in incident asthma (strongest e ffect from prenatal ma ternal smoking on asthma in children aged <=2 years, OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.352.53, 5 studies)., CONCLUSIONS: Building u pon previous findings, exposu re to passive smoking increases the incidence of wheeze and asthma in children and yo ung people by at least 20%.

Int J Hyg Environ Health 2010;213(1):131. Abstract: Studies have reported contradictory effects of cat an d dog exposure on aller gy, resulting in inconsistent r ecommendations on animal avoidan ce. We conducted a systematic review of observation al studies published in English from 2000 to January 2009. It shows in this review tha t the reported exposurerespon se relationships are contradictory. A total of 17 and 13 birth cohort studies on cat and dog exposure, re spectively, are included in the review. Most of the birth cohor t studies found that cat or dog exposure in early life had no effect on the development of asthma or wheezing symptoms and dog exposure during infancy was found to protect c hildren from devel oping sensitization against aeroallergens. A total of 7 and 6 p rospective studies in schoolage children or adults on cat and dog exposure, respecti vely, are included in this review and most of these studies suggested an inverse associati on between cat expo sure and asthma and wheezing symp toms. As for crosssectional s tudies, 26 and 21 studies on cat and dog exposure, respectively, are included in this review, which cover a broad range of age groups and geographical areas, and reporte d inconsistent results. The evidence summarised in this systematic review needs to be i nterpreted with cau tion, the inconsistent study resu lts may be due to study design , exposure assessment, and avoidance measure. The expos ureresponse relationships may also alter in geo graphical areas where the community prevalence of cats and dogs are significantly dif ferent. However, as the evidence of the effects of pet keeping on subsequent develop ment of asthma or allergic disea ses presented in this review ar e not overwhelmingly strong, the decision of whether to keep a cat or a dog in the f amily should be based on arguments other than the concern of developing asthma and aller gy.

Environ Res 2012; Resultat Abstract: BACKGROUND: Asthma aff ects more than 17 million peopl e in the United States;1/3 of these are children . Children are particularly vul nerable to airborne pollution because of their narrower airway s and because they generally br eathe more air per pound of body weight than adults , increasing their exposure to air pollutants. However, the results from previous studie s on the association between mo tor vehicle emissions and the development of childhood whe eze and asthma are conflicting. Therefore, we con ducted a metaanalysis to clarify their potential relationship. METHODS: MEDLINE, High wire, and The Cochrane Library d atabases were searched for rele vant studies. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) with correspond ing 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association be tween traffic air pollutants and wheeze or asthma were retrieve d from individual studies and pooled to generate summary e ffect estimates (metaOR) in ST ATA 11.1. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included in the metaanalysis. Exposure t o nitrogen dioxide (meta OR: (metaOR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.011.12) were positively associated with a high er prevalence of childhood asthm a. Exposure to sulfur dioxide ( metaOR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.011.07) was positively associat ed with a higher prevalence o f wheeze in children. Ex posure to nitrogen dioxide was positively associated with a hig her incidence of childhood asthma (metaOR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.061.24), and exposures to par ticulate matter was posi tively associated with a higher incidence wheeze in children (metaOR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.041.07). CONCLUSIONS: Living or attending schools near high traffic density roads ex poses children to higher levels of motor vehicle air pollutants , and increases the incidence and prevalence of childhood asthma and wheeze Genuneit J. Exposure to farming environments in childhood and a sthma and wheeze in rural populations: a systematic review rint] ABSTRACT: Asthma is a chronic re spiratory disorder that has bec ome substantially more common over the past decades. One environmental factor for whic h particularly strong associations with asthma and a llergic diseases have been descri bed is exposure to farming environments in childhood. The aim of this systematic review wa s to update and extend existing narrative reviews, test for heterogeneity of effect ac ross studies, and conduct a metaanalysis to report a summar y effect measure. Published rel evant literature was searched through PubMed includi ng all articles added to PubMed before September 1, 2011. Articles were included if t hey reported an epidemiologica l study on the exposure to a farming environment in childh ood and subsequent wheeze or ast hma. Heterogeneity of effect measures across studies was evaluate d using Cochran's Q and I(2) . Randomeffects metaanalysis was performed to summarize effect measures for va rious outcome defini tions. In total, 357 retrieved abs tracts revealed 52 original a rticles from 39 studies with data considered for th e metaanalysis. Most studies were conduc ted among children or on childhood onset of disease. Most data were published on doctor diagnosed asthma or cur rent wheeze. The metaanalysis showed substantial heterogeneity across studies with similar outcome definitions. None theless, the combined effects were statistically signifi cant and showed an approximate 25% lower asthma prevalence amon g exposed subjects compared with unexposed subjects. The protective 'farmeffect' on asthma was reported in numerous studies. Its underly ing factors ought to be studied , and promising efforts have been already made. However, the heterogeneity of the effec t across studies should also be investigated because whatever causes it is a potential threat to valid synthesis of evidence and to the detection of specific protective factors 48 Resultat Kabir Z, Alpert HR, Goodman PG , Haw S, Behm I, Connolly GN, et al.

Abstract: RECORD STATUS: This is a critical abstract of a systematic review that meets the criteria for inclusion on DARE. Each critical ab stract contains a brief summary of the review methods, results and conclusions followed by a detailed critical assessment on the reliability of the review and the conclusions drawn AUTHOR'S OBJECTIVES: T o assess the effect o f smokefree home an d workplace policies on secondhand smoke expo sure levels in children SEARCHING: PubMed, EMBASE and Co chrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Regis ter were searched from January 20 00 to April 2010 for studies p ublished in English. Search terms were reported. The Journal of Tobacco Control and relevant grey literature were also searched VALIDITY ASSESSMENT: Formal qual ity assessment was not performe d DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted on percentage of participa nts experiencing an event or odd ratios with 95% conf idence intervals. The authors did not state how many reviewers performed data extraction RESULTS OF THE REVIEW: Nineteen studies were included in the re view. The total num ber of participants was not repo rted. Voluntary household smoki ng restrictions were as sociated with a reduction in childhood secondhand smoke exposu re (ranging between 20% and 50% reductions). Mandated comprehensive workplace and e nclosed public smokefree policies led to a ben efit in participants' health ou tcomes, including a decrease in preterm birth risks and a red uction in emergency hospital vi sits due to asthma AUTHOR'S CONCLUSION: The evidenc e suggested that any reductions in secondhand smoke exposure levels in public settings would ultimately lead to improvements in the general health of children in pr ivate settings but smokefree h ome policies would have additional benefits CRD COMMENTARY: This review's in clusion criteria were clear. Re levant databases were searched. Efforts were made to find both published and unpublis hed studies, which mini mised the potential for publicat ion bias. It appeared that this review mainly included stu dies in English, which may have increased the risk of language bias. It was unclear wheth er sufficient attempts were made to minimise reviewers' errors and biases in the review process. The authors discussed so me aspects of study quality su ch as study power, but a formal quality assessment was not performed. Most of the includ ed studies were observa tional studies, which were susceptible to bias. Given the diver sity of included studies in relation to study design and outc omes, a narrative synthesis wa s appropriately employed. Given the limited methodological rigour of included studies, th e authors' conclusions should be interpreted with caution IMPLICATIONS OF THE REVIEW FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH: Practice: The authors stated that childhood secondhand smoke exposure in private set tings should be consi dered an intervention priority in paediatric and public health settings. Health profession als and other key stakeholders need appropriate training relati ng to the issues on smok ing in the home and how to address these issues. Research: The authors stated that fur ther research was required to investigate interventions on redu cing secondhand smoke exposure levels in children and develop a more robust evidence base to inform effective actions on this issue. Future st udies (with a longterm follow up) should be conducted with an appropriate representati ve sample and personalised seco ndhand smoke expo sure measurements across different population settings. Studies from lowincome coun tries were required. Further studies to evaluate additional pae diatric outcomes strongly associated with sudden infant death syndrom e and otitis media w ere also required 49 Resultat Latza U, Gerdes S, Baur X. Effec ts of nitrogen dioxide on human health: systematic re view of experimental and epidemi ological studies conducted betw een 2002 and 2006. Int J Hyg Environ Health 2009;212(3):27187. Abstract: In order to assess heal th effects in humans caused by environmental nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) a systematic revi ew of studies in humans was co nducted. MEDLINE database was searched for epidemi ological studies and experimen ts on adverse effects of NO(2) published between 2002 and 2006. The evidence with reg ard to NO(2) expo sure limits was assesse d using the Scottish Intercollegiate Gui delines Network (SIGN) grading system and the modified three star system. Of the 214 a rticles retrieved 112 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There was limited evidence th at shortterm exposure to a 1h mean value below 200 microg NO(2)/m(3) is associated with a dverse health effects provided by only one study on mort ality in patients with severe asthma (*2+). The ef fect remained after adjusting fo r other air pollutants. There w as moderate evidence that shortterm exposure below a 24h mean value of 50 microg N O(2)/m(3) at moni tor stations increases hospital admissions and mortality (**2+) . Evidence was also moderate when the search was restricted to susceptible populati ons (children, adoles cents, elderly, and asthmatics). There was moderate evidence th at longterm exposure to an annual mean be low 40 microg NO(2)/m( 3) was associated wit h adverse health effects (respiratory symptoms/di seases, hospital admissions, mo rtality, and otitis me dia) provided by generally consis tent findings in five wellcon ducted cohort and case control studies with some shortcomings in the study quality (** 2+). Evidence was also moderate when the search was restricted to studies in susceptib le populations (child ren and adolescents) and for the combination with other air pol lutants. The most fre quent reasons for decreased study quality were potential miscla ssification of exposure and selection bias. None of the highquality observational stud ies evaluated was infor mative for the key questions due to the choice of the dose para meter (e.g., 1week mean) and exposure levels above the limit values. Inclusion of study designs unlisted in the SIGN grading system did not bring additional evidence regar ding exposures below the current air quality limit values for NO(2). As several rece nt studies reported ad verse health effects below the c urrent exposure limits for NO(2 ) particularly among susceptible populations regarding longterm exposure further re search is needed. Apart from highquality epidemio logical studies on causality an d the interaction of NO(2) with other air pollutants there is a need for doubleblin ded randomized cross over studies among susceptible p opulations for further evaluati on of the shortterm exposure limits Lodge CJ, Allen KJ, Lo we AJ, Hill DJ, Hosking CS, Abramson MJ, et al.

Wireless commun ication fields and nonspecific symptoms of ill health: a literature review. Wien Med Wochenschr 2011;161(910):24050. Abstract: This is an update of a previous systematic review on the association between radiofrequency electromagnetic f ield (RFEMF) exposure and heal threlated quality of life that included studies publi shed before August 2007 [1]. Si nce then, nine rando mized trials addressed shortterm exposures from closetobody RFEMF sources such as mobile phones, and two observa tional studies investigated th e effects of mobile phone use on healthrelated quality of life. Six randomized tri als addressed shortterm farfield exposure arising, for instance, from mobile phone bas e stations, and eight stu dies evaluated the effects of environmental farfield RFEMF ex posure. In most of the randomized trials, no exposurer esponse association was observe d. The sporadically reported associations did not show a consistent pattern regardi ng the type of symp toms or the direction of the eff ects (increase/decrease). Simil arly, most of the recent observational studies did not sho w associations between RFEMF exposure and non specific symptoms. However, the exposure gradients were small a nd possible exposure misclassification is a limitation of these studies. Longitudina l studies as well as studies in children and adolescents are scarce. In summary, recent rese arch did not indicate healthrelated quality of life to be affected by RFEMF exposur e in our everyday envi ronment. Furthermore, none of th e studies showed that individua ls with selfreported electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) were more susceptible to RFEMF than the rest of the population. Nevertheless, the rapid technological develo pment and anticipated increase in exposure levels warra nt the conduct of further long itudinal studies. Due to the widespread use of wireless co mmunication technologies poten tial adverse health effects would have major p ublic health consequences Sauni R, Uitti Sigsgaard JH. Remediating buildings damaged by dampness and mould fo r preventing or reducing respir atory tract symp toms, infections and asthma. Cochrane Rev 2011;9:CD007897. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Dampness an d mould in buildings have been associated with adverse respiratory symptoms, as thma and respiratory infections of inhabitants. Mois ture damage is a very common problem in private houses, workpla ces and public build ings such as schools., OBJECTIVES : To determine the effectivene ss of remediating build ings damaged by dampness and mould in order to reduce or preven t respiratory tract symptoms, infections and symptom s of asthma., SE ARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Cont rolled Trials (CENTRAL) (The C ochrane Library 2011, Issue 2), which contains the Coc hrane Acute Respiratory Infecti ons Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1951 to June week 1, 2011), EMBASE (1974 to June 2011), CINAHL 52 Resultat (1982 to June 2011), Science Citation Index (1973 to June 2011) , Biosis Previews (1989 to June 2011), NIOSHTIC (1930 to November 2010) and CISDOC (197 4 to November 2010)., SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) , clusterRCTs (cRCTs), interrupted time series studies and controlled before after (CBA) studies of the effects of remediating dampness and mould in a building on respiratory symptoms, infections and asthma., DATA COL LECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two autho rs independent ly extracted data and assessed th e risk of bias in the included studies., MAIN RESULTS: We included eight stud ies (6538 participants); two RCTs pa rticipants), one cRCT (4407 participants) and five CBA studies (1837 participants). T he interventions varied from thorough renovation to clean ing only. We foun d moderatequ ality evidence in adults that repairing houses de creased asthmarelated symptoms (among others, wheezing (odds ratio (OR) 0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0. 55 to 0.75) and respira tory infections (among others, rhinitis (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.49 t o 0.66)). For children, we found moderatequality evidence that the number of acute care v isits (among others mean difference (MD) 0.45; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.14)) decreased i n the group receiving thorough remediation.One CBA study showed very lowquality evid ence that after re pairing a moulddamaged office b uilding, asthmarelated and oth er respiratory symp toms decreased. For children and staff in schools, there was ve ry lowquality evidence that asthmarelated and other re spiratory symptoms in moulddam aged schools were similar to those of children and staff in nondamaged schools, both before and after in tervention. For children, respira tory infections might have dec reased after the inter vention., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found moderate to very lowq uality evidence that repairing moulddamaged hou ses and offices decreases asthm arelated symptoms and respiratory infections compa red to no intervention in adult s. There is very low quality evidence that although r epairing schools did not signif icantly change respirato ry symptoms in staff or children, pupils' visits to physicians due to a common cold were less frequent after remediation of the school.

Is there a rural/urban gradient in the prevalence of eczema? A systematic review. Br J Dermatol 2010;162(5):96473. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Eczema affects approximately 10% of all s choolchildren in the western world and has shown an i ncrease over the past decades i n 'developing' coun tries. Numerous factors have bee n suggested that might contribu te to the increasing prevalence of eczema. A plausible explanation is the role of en vironmental factors. As part of the 'hygiene hypothesis' it has been thought that eczem a is more common in urban than in rural co mmunities, but such a notion has never be en assessed systemati cally., OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess whether there is a rur al/urban gradient for the prevalence of eczema and, if so, to what extent., METHODS: All data sources were identified through a search in M EDLINE and EMBASE. All primary studies comparing the prevalence rate of eczema be tween urban and rural populatio ns were assessed for eligibility. Included articles we re reviewed for methodological quality and a relative risk was calculated to indicate the risk of eczema in urban ove r rural areas. Results Twentysix articles we re included for analys is. Nineteen showed a higher risk for ec zema in an urbanized area, of wh ich 11 were significant. Six st udies showed a lower risk of eczema in an urbanized area, of which one was statistic ally significant. One study had a relative risk of 1.0 0., RESULTS: were more homogene ous among studies of good methodological quality. A p ooled relative risk could have been calculated but was not because of heterogeneity., C ONCLUSION: There i s some eviden ce of a higher risk for eczema in urban compared with ru ral areas, suggesting that plac e of residence may have a role in the pathogenesis of eczema. Future reviews on en vironmental circums tances should be carried out to reveal the factors associated w ith a higher prevalence of eczema in urban areas and the a ssociation with other allergic d iseases Simons E, To T, Dell S.

[Epub ahead of print] Abstract: Background: It has long been assumed that the develop ment of childhood asth ma is related to exposure to env ironmental chemicals. However, it has thus far not been possible to unequivocally establi sh this suspected relationship by individual studies. Moreover, studies of children ha ve been scanty and unreliable d ue to the large diversity of research environments and subject cohorts. The current study wa s aimed at clarifying this relationship for one factor by me ans of a metaanalysis of stud ies investigating the influ ence of NO(2) exposure on symptomatology of childhood asthma. M ethods: We searched two electronic databases (MEDLINE and EMBASE) for literature on relationships between environmental chemical exposure and development of childhood as thma using the MeSH terms nitrogen dioxide and asthm a. We did this according to the MOOSE guidelines for metaanalyses of observational s tudies. Results: We retrieved 1 30 papers of which 12 met the selection criteria. These pap ers described observational st udies from 7 countries. Study subjects were 97,932 ordina ry children aged 018 years. R andom model analysis revealed that the Odds Ratio (OR ) for asthma development due to an increment of 10 ppb of NO(2) was 1.135 with a 95% CI of 1.0311.251 (P=0.01), while the OR for wheezing symptoms was 1.052 with a 95% CI of 1.0201.085 (P=0.001). It i s therefore evident that NO(2) exposure does influence the development of asthma in ordi nary children. Conclu sions: Our metaanalysis indicate d that exposure to NO(2) in th e air significantly influ enced the development of childhood asthma and symptoms of wheez ing. Tischer C, Chen CM, Heinrich J. Association between domestic mo uld and mould com ponents, and asthma and allergy in children: a s ystematic revie w. Eur Respir J 2011;38(4):81224. Abstract: Critical reviews over the past 10 yrs have found incr eased respiratory and allergic health outcomes for chi ldren living in damp and mouldy environments. How ever, recent studies have sugges ted that early childhood exposu re to specific mould components may actually protect c hildren from developing allerg y. We conducted a systematic review of observation al studies published in English from January 1980 to July 2010. This review was conduc ted according to systematic gu idelines for Meta analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE). The literature was searched using a compu terised bibliographic database, PubMed. I n order to increase the quality of the reviewed stud ies, metaanalyses of the effec ts of visible mould expo sure on allergic health outcomes were performed and we evaluate d the findings ac cording to the Bradford Hill crite ria for evidence of causation . The literature search identified 1,398 peerreviewed s cientific publications, and 61 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in this review. We observed in creased risks of allergic respiratory health outcomes in c hildren exposed to visible moul d and mould spores. These findings were confirmed by the results of the metaanalys is and in line with the evaluation criteria according to Bradford Hill. Visible mould w as positively associated with asthma (OR 1.49 (95% CI 1.28 1.72)), wheeze (OR 1.68 (95% allergic rhinitis (OR 1.39 (95% CI 1.281.51)). However, there was a tendency of lower risk for allergic health outcomes in children exposed to mould derived components such as (1,3)betadg lucan and extracellular polysaccharides. These findings suggest that with visi ble mould and mould spore expos ure increase the risk of allergic respiratory hea lth outcomes in children. Howev er, further investigations are needed to examine the effect s of exposure to mouldderived components as the current literature is inconclusive . In order to disentangle the different effects of overall microbial exposure on children's health, research should focus on specific microbial 55 Resultat markers in the home, in combination with new assessment techniq ues including mole cular son J, et al. Meta analysis of mould and dampness exposure on asthma and allergy i n eight European birth cohorts: an EN RIECO initiative. Allergy 2011;66(12):15709. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Several cro sssectional studies during th e past 10 years have observed an increased risk of alle rgic outcomes for children li ving in damp or mouldy environments., OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to in vestigate whether re ported mould or dampness exposu re in early life is associated w ith the development of allergic disorders in children f rom eight European birth cohort s., METHODS: We ana lysed data from 31 742 children f rom eight ongoing European bir th cohorts. Exposure to mould and allergic health outcomes were assessed by parental questionnaires at dif ferent time points. Metaanalyse s with fixed and randomeffect models were applied. The number of the studies included in each analysis varied base d on the outcome data available for each cohort., RESU LTS: Exposure to visible mould and/or dampness dur ing first 2 years of life was a ssociated with an increased risk of developing asthma: there was a significant association with early asthma symptoms in metaanalyses of four cohorts [02 years: adjuste d odds ratios (aOR), 1.39 (95% CI, 1.051.84)] and with asthma later in childhood in six cohorts [68 years: aOR, 1.09 (95% CI, CI, 0 .901.34)]. A statistically sig nificant association was observed in six cohorts with symptoms of allergic rhinitis at s chool age [68 years: aOR, 1.12 (1.021.23)] and at any time point between 3 and 10 years [aOR, 1.18 (1.09 1.28)]., CONCLUSION: These finding s suggest that a mouldy home environment in early life is associated with an increased risk of asthma particularl y in young children and allergic rhinitis symptoms in schoolage children. Treyster Z, Gitterman B. Second hand smoke exposure in children : environmental fac tors, physiological effects, and interventions within pediatric s. Rev Environ Health 2011;26(3):18795. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Second han d smoke (SHS) ex posure has long been correlated with many adverse disease proce sses, particularly in children. For children growing up with socioeconomic disadvantages a nd increased exposure to SHS, exposure can have farreaching consequences., OBJE CTIVE: The purpose of this revi ew was to examine the literature assessing the effects of SHS exposure in children, a s well as the perspectives of both parents and providers re garding current practices in ce ssation counseling. The review also sought out recommend ations on ways to increase the influence of pediatri cians on parental smoking., STUD Y GROUP: Children under the age of 18 years., ME THODS: PubMed and MEDL INE were searched sys tematically. A narra tive approach was used because the studies di ffered in methods and data., RES ULTS: The studies showed correlations between SHS e xposure and sudden infant deat h syndrome (SIDS), asthma, altered respiratory func tion, infection, cardiovascular effects, behavior prob lems, sleep difficulties, increas ed cancer risk, and a higher l ikelihood of smoking initia tion. Questionnaires of both paren ts and pediatricians showed t hat pediatricians are not consistently carrying out th e recommended smoking cessation interventions, with lack of training as a primary ba rrier. Nevertheless, interventi ons targeting improved cessation training for both reside nts and practicing pediatrici ans have been studied and show promising results., CONC LUSIONS: SHS exposure has many detrimental ef fects on children's health, part icularly for those in low socio economic circumstances, for which factors in the built environment accentuated a higher baseline risk. By coun seling parents, expanding reside ncy education, and continuing a dvocacy work, pedia 56 Resultat tricians can have a significant positive impact on children's h ealth as related to SHS ex posure Weinmayr G, Romeo De Sario F. Shor tterm effects of PM10 and NO2 on respiratory heal th among children with asthma o r asthmalike symptoms: a systematic the shortterm ef fects of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter < or = 10 microm (PM10) and ni trogen dioxide (NO2) on respiratory health of asthmatic children from publishe d panel studies, and to investigate the influence of stu dy and population characteristi cs as effect modifiers., DATA EXTRACTION: After a systematic literature review, we extra cted quantitative es timates of the association of PM10 and/or NO2 with respiratory symptoms and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Combined effect estimates for an increas e of 10 microg/m3 were calculated by random e ffects metaanalysis for all studies and for different strata de fined by study characteristics. The effect of publication bias was investigated with Eg ger's and Begg's tests and \"trim andfill\" analyses., DATA SYNT HESIS: We identified 36 studies; 14 were part of the E uropean Pollution Effects on Asth matic Children in Eu rope (PEACE) study. Adverse asso ciations of PM10 with asthma sy 95% confidence in terval (CI), 1.0061.051]. There were also associations, al though not statistically signif icant, of PM10 with cough (OR = 1.012; 95% and PEF 95% CI, 0.214 to 0.050). NO2 had statistically significant associations with asthma symptoms in the overall analysis considering all possible lags (OR = 1.031; 95% CI, 1.0011.062), but not when we evaluated only the 0 1 lag. We found no publication bias, although it ap peared when excluding the PEACE studies. When we applied the tr imandfill method to the data set without the PEAC E studies, the results were sim ilar to the overall esti mates from all studies. There was an indication for stronger PM 10 associations for stu dies conducted in summer, outside of Europe, with longer lags, and in locations with higher NO2 concentrations., CONCLUSIONS: We found clear evidenc e of effects of PM10 on the occurrence of asthma symptom episodes, and to a lesser e xtent on cough and PEF. The results for NO2 are mor e difficult to interpret becaus e they depend on the lag times examined. There was an indication of effect modification by several study condi tions Xu Z, Etzel RA, Su H, Huang C, G uo Y, Tong S. Impact of ambient temperature on child ren's health: A systematic review.

Sin gle nucleotide poly morphisms (SNPs) in the region including ORMDL3 on chromosome 1 7q21 were re lated to childhood asthma risk a nd ORMDL3 expression levels in Europeans., OBJEC TIVE: We examined whether polymorphisms in ORMDL3 and the adjac ent gasdermin like (GSDML) gene associated with asthma in the genomewide ass ociation study are related to childhood asthma and atopy in a Mexico City populati on., METHODS: We ge notyped rs4378650 in ORMDL3 and in GSDML in 615 nucle ar families con sisting of asthmatic children ag ed 417 years and their parents . Atopy was determined by skin prick tests to 25 aeroa llergens., RESULTS: Individuals carrying the C allele of rs4378650 or the T alle le of rs7216389 had increased risk of as thma [relative risk (RR) = 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.192.53, P = 0.003 for o ne or two copies of rs4378650 C, and RR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.122.38, P = 0.009 for one or two copies of rs7216389 T). Linkage disequilibrium between the two SNPs was h igh (r(2) = 0.92). 57 Resultat Neither of the SNPs was associated with the degree of atopy. A metaanalysis of five published studies on rs7216389 in nine populations gave an odds ratio for asthma of 1.44 (95% CI, 1.351.54, P < 0.00001)., CONCLUSIONS: Our result s and the meta analysis provide evidence to conf irm the finding from a recent genomewide associa tion study that polymorphisms in ORMDL3 and the adjacent GSDML may contribute to childhood asthma 58 Vedlegg Daily and Ov id MEDLINE(R) 1946 to Present # Searches Results 1 Asthma/ 97734 2 Hypersensitivity/ or child, preschool/ or infant/ or infant, newborn/ or infant, low birth weight/ or infant, small for gestational age/ or infant, very low birth weight/ or in- fant, extremely low birth weight/ or infa postmature/ premature/ 1888408 7 (child* or or babies or newborn*).tw. 1184129 8 or/6-7 2181047 9 5 and 8 60902 10 limit 9 to \"reviews (m aximizes specificity)\" 848 11 limit 10 to yr=\"2009 -Current\" 301 CRD - 2012-08-01 Line (child* infant* or toddler* or baby or babies or newborn*)) IN DARE, HTA FROM 2009 TO 2012 142 PubMed - 2012-08-02 Search Query Items found #13 Search (((#1) AND (child* or infant* or born*) #1 Search (asthma* ran*)):ti,ab,kw and (child* or infant* or toddler * or baby or babies or newborn*):ti,ab,kw, from 2009 to 2012 in Cochrane Reviews 150 "}
