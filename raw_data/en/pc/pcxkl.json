Shodhana therapies known as Panchakarma help to eliminate these toxins from our mind and body. These are suggested when the body accumulates excessive toxins and is unable to excrete them with diet and herbals alone. Some of the therapies we offer include: - Shirodhara (neurological health) - Nasya (respiratory health) - Vasti (knee, neck, back pain) - Abhyanga (overall health) - Hair Loss help [Read more about each of these therapies](https://www.vedichealth.org/ayurvedic-panchakarma-therapy). Pranic Healing is an energy-based modality that integrates body, breath and pure consciousness. It is an opportunity to deepen your experience of your whole self and to explore and release deeply held patterns and blocks from cellular memory, the energy body, and even deeper layers of consciousness. A practice of light and energy work that invite healing on the deepest levels of being. Especially healing when you are looking to release deep emotional or traumatic or karmic experiences and to break away from self-destructing habits or patterns. Counseling is an integral part of Ayurveda and our health treatment protocols. Often there is a tremendous release of emotional blockages when a suffering individual has a platform to speak openly without fear of judgement. Once these blockages open up, the doshas are allowed to move freely, and symptoms begin to decrease. During a one-hour counseling session, the Counselor's goal is to listen compassionately and ask specific questions to help the client in uncovering deep-seated emotions that may be masked or buried and creating blockage. An initial health consultation with an Ayurvedic Practitioner is suggested so we can offer guidance on diet and lifestyle changes for a more holistic approach to healing. Our Hatha Yoga classes follow the ancient teachings of yoga as taught in the schools of India for generations, and focus on healing as much as relaxing and strengthening. Our classes are designed for our clients who often suffer from pain and illness, thus they are unique and different from a typical studio class. Our instructors place importance on breathing and relaxation during the practice of postures, and attaining to higher states of consciousness during meditation practice to invite healing to take place. We offer classes for all ages and abilities, beginner to advanced, kids to seniors, and special classes just to practice deep, slow breathing called Pranayama. Though we offer weekly classes in Hatha Yoga, some people may be seeking individualized attention to their practice of postures, or they may want to learn in a private setting at our Center. Our yoga therapy sessions are designed specifically to suit the needs, ability and health condition of our client. Yoga therapy is incredibly helpful in relieving all kinds of joint and muscular pain including back, neck, legs, and feet, and also beneficial for recovery from injury, surgery, or long periods without exercise. Improve flexibility, reduce stress chemicals, gain muscle strength, balance and coordination. For seniors, our instructor comes to your home to teach. Certified and experienced yoga teachers.
