When your spine is not functioning properly and one of your vertebrae is out of place, it can throw your whole body out of sync. These problems can lead to fatigue, poor digestion, depression, and so on. Thankfully the team at Horst Chiropractic can help. While regular chiropractic visits to our Temecula, CA office can help [relieve back pain and vertebral subluxations](http://www.horst-chiropractic.com/how-we-can-help), it's important to consider the causes of these problems. Vertebral subluxations are caused by toxins in the environment, physical trauma, and mental or psychological stressors. Let's examine how toxins are linked vertebral subluxations and what can be done to lead a healthier lifestyle. Examples of Common Toxins Toxins can come from almost anywhere. The world is saturated with harmful, non-natural substances, even in the food we eat, the beverages we drink, and the air we breath. Examples include: - Plastics: Common chemicals in plastics such as bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates can affect hormones and human development. Given the pervasiveness of plastics in modern life, avoiding exposure can be difficult. - Oxybenzone: A common ingredient in sunscreens, moisturizers, and lip balms, these toxins could potentially affect hormone levels and even result in low birth weight. - Fluoride: There is an ongoing debate about the safety of fluoride. Swallowing fluoride in high levels can be toxic; yet it's found in our drinking water as well many types of toothpaste. - Butylated Hydroxyanisole (BHA): This common additive found in products as diverse as chewing gum and diaper creams may cause cancer when exposed in high enough doses. - Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA): PFOA is common in non-stick Teflon coatings. Unfortunately, this component can affect your hormones and other aspects of your health. - Asbestos: While not commonly used now, this toxic material was common for housing insulation and other products. Many old homes may still have asbestos. - Pesticides and Herbicides: These common chemicals used to help protect crops contain countless harmful substances not intended for human consumption. - Cigarettes: Tobacco products are bad for plenty of reasons, including the toxins contained in the products. Smoking and second-hand smoke causes cancer and other medical health issues. Toxins in Our Foods In addition to all of the above items, we also have to consider where our food comes from. Keep in mind that toxins that wind up in the water or on plants may not be eliminated, even with modern water treatment technology. These toxins can wind up in the feed ingested by livestock, cows, pigs, fish, and chickens. When we consume this livestock in the form of meat or dairy products, we may be harming ourselves from the simple act of consumption. Addressing the Issue of Toxins Above is only a partial list of common toxins in everyday life. It's important to eliminate toxins from our lives as best as we can. Be sure to use a water filer of some kind instead of drinking from the tap. If you have any plastic cups or dishware, verify that these items do not contain BPA or phthalates. Avoid smoking and the use of tobacco products, and be very careful about swallowing toothpaste or using any products that contain fluoride. With regard to your diet, consider eating organic foods that are grown without the aid of pesticides or herbicides. Avoid foods that are highly processed, and always rinse produce thoroughly. Try to research where your food came from if you can.
