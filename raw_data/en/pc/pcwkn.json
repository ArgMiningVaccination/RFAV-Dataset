I wake up each morning, crack my windows to allow for fresh air to come in, make my bed, make my coffee, feed my animals, journal about my dreams, journal what I'm grateful for, and write anything else on my mind that needs to get out, then meditate and administer reiki on myself, and do some movement based on how much time and energy I have that morning.

This in turn helps improve digestion by calming the nervous system. Relaxing, resting, and digesting also help to lower cortisol levels (the stress hormone), which in turn impacts the entire system. I prefer yoga and meditation for my relaxation routine, but there are many other ways like sitting in prayer or practicing mindfulness in nature.
