This is a Pharmacy \"boutique\" with wonderful health and well-being items and lots of unique home decor and inspirational (or laugh out loud funny!) gift items. And the yummy fragrances are intoxicating! I couldn't leave until I had browsed every aisle. Always so friendly and helpful! I go here for any all natural health products my family may need. Very knowledgeable about items and such sweet people who work here! Thanks! Sango Pharmacy is always so helpful! While they didn't have the product on hand I was looking for, they were more than willing to order it for me. Also, the people who work there are so kind! Their products are competitively priced. And while Sango carries the traditional pharmaceuticals, they also have a huge selection for the more natural minded. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Sango!
