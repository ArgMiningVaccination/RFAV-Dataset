Test Example 6 Analgesic Experiment of the Chinese Herbal Medicine Patch in the Present Invention (1) Mice Acetic Acid Writhing Test Method Principle: if the animals are stimulated by chemical substances, for example, apply acetic acid, bradykinin or K+ etc. by intraperitoneal injection to stimulate peritoneum or contact skin, in order to induce pain reaction in the chemical sensitivity acceptor, and show writhing behaviors such as abdomen shrinkage invagination, hind limb extension, body torsion or worming and so on. Test animals are ICR mice (male, 6-8 weeks). During the experiment, test animals can eat and drink freely. Before the experiment, animals should fast for 24 h. Experiment is divided into three groups, which are respectively negative control group (patch containing no medicine), positive control group (commercial Indomethacin or Diclofenac sodium patch) and experiment group (using 4 different dosages of patch for the experiment), 12 mice in each group. The mice are weighed and made numbers, then fixed the limbs to the flat plate and shaved off the belly hair. The patch (2 cm\u00d73 cm) is adhered to the belly of mice for 3 h, then removed off (or do not remove the patch). The mice are injected with 0.6 wt % of acetic acid by intraperitoneal injection. The writhing time of mice is observed in 10 minutes and recorded the average value of writhing, the result is shown in FIG. 9. The result is that, the average value of writhing for the Chinese herbal medicine patch in the present invention is lower than that of the negative control group (patch containing no medicine); therefore, the Chinese herbal medicine patch in the present invention definitely has analgesic effect. (2) Formalin Test Method Principle: pain raction of central and peripheral nervous system can be observed in the rats and house mice applied with diluted formalin by subcutaneous injection, and Formalin licking feet experiment is set up early in 1977 by Dubuisson and Dennis, the experiment is a kind of effective and reliable model for the selection of most of analgesic drugs. If people is applied with formalin by subcutaneous injection, formalin can cause strong and acute burning sensation after 4-5 minutes, in the following 30-60 minutes, continuous pain occurs. If house mice are applied with formalin, they may lick their feet or stamp their feet because feet is stimulated by formalin to produce pain, the licking feet time taken by initial pain caused by the injected formalin in 0-5 minutes is called early stage, pain reaction is mainly caused by substance P and bradykinin released through directly irritating pain reaction acceptor. The licking feet time consumed in 15-40 minutes is called later stage, which is mainly caused by some chemical transmitters such as histamine, serotonin, prostaglandin and kinin etc., released from the damaged cells due to inflammatory reaction. In all, licking feet behavior caused by pain of white mice induced by formalin, can evaluate effectively activity and mechanism of analgesic treating inflammatory and noninflammatory pain. Additionally, pain reaction caused by formalin, concentration of which is an important factor. When the concentration of formalin is in the range of 0.02-0.2 wt %, it can only induce licking feet reaction in early stage, identified by optical microscope, and the change is slight, when the concentration of formalin is 1 wt % or more, it can induce licking feet reaction in early stage and later stage, when the concentration of formalin is 5 wt %, acute inflammatory reaction, damage and swelling of granulocytes can be seen from histological identification after 30 minutes. Test animals are ICR white mice (male, 6-8 weeks). During the experiment, test animals can eat and drink freely. Before the experiment, animals should fast for 24 h. Experiment is divided into three groups, which are respectively negative control group (patch containing no medicine), positive control group (commercial Indomethacin or Diclofenac sodium patch) and experiment group (using 4 different dosages of patch for the experiment), 12 mice in each group. The white mice are weighed and made numbers. The patch (2 cm\u00d73 cm) is cut into four equal parts, then adhered to the instep of mice, and then fixed with breathable tape. The patch is removed after 3 h, and the mice are applied with 20 L of 1 wt % freshly formalin solution on instep by subcutaneous injection. The licking feet time during 0-5 minutes and 15-40 minutes is calculated, and the result is shown in FIG. 10. The result is that, licking feet time for the Chinese herbal medicine patch in the present invention is lower than that of the negative control group (patch containing no medicine); therefore, the Chinese herbal medicine patch in the present invention definitely has analgesic effect. Test Example 7 Antiinflammation and Detumescence Test on the Chinese Herbal Medicine Patch in the Present Invention Principle: edema caused by injecting -carrageenin into plantar is a biphasic effect, after injected with -carrageenin, different substances can be released to induce inflammation and swelling in different time period, that is to say, histamine, serotonin and platelet activating factor (PAF) can be released in the time period of 0-1.5 h or 20 minutes to 1 h (the first stage), and kinin can be released in the time period of 1.5-2.5 h (the second stage), then prostaglandin and leukotriene can be released after 2.5 h (the third stage), leading to inflammation and swelling. Test animals are SD white rats (male, 6-8 weeks). During the experiment, test animals can eat and drink freely. Before the experiment, animals should fast for 24 h. Experiment is divided into three groups, which are respectively negative control group (patch containing no medicine), positive control group (commercial Indomethacin or Diclofenac sodium patch) and experiment group (using 4 different dosages of patch for the experiment), 8 rats in each group. The white rats are weighed and made numbers, drawn a measuring line on the plantar of white rats with sighning pen. The volume of the plantar is firstly measured by a swelling tester. The white rats are dresses with corset elastic bandage to avoid the Chinese herbal medicine patch bited by the white rats. of the white rats in each group are applied with 0.1 mL of Carrageenan (10 mg/mL in saline) by subcutaneous injection in plantar. The Chinese herbal medicine patch (2 cm\u00d73 cm) are adhered to the plantar for positive control group and experiment group, and fixed with breathable tape, swelling percent is measured in the time of 0 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h and 24 h with a swelling tester (changing the Chinese herbal medicine patch after determining in different time). Observing the swelling condition in different time and draw swelling curve of experiment group and comparison group, identifying if it is of biometrical differences, as shown in FIG. 11. The result is that, swelling percent for the Chinese herbal medicine patch in the present invention is lower than negative control group (patch containing no medicine); therefore, the Chinese herbal medicine patch in the present invention definitely has antiinflammation and detumescence effect. Although the present invention has described the above examples, these examples do not use to define the present invention, a person skill in the art with common knowledge of this field can make various changes and modification without departing from the spirit of the present invention. Thus, the protection scope of the present invention should be that defined by the claims. "}
