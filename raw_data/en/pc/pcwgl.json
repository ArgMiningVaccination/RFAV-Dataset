I'm sharing why we ordered the Wiwiurka Rocker Balance Board and why our family loves it so much! Our rocker was gifted to us by Wiwiurka in exchange for our honest review.

The Wiwiurka Rocker Balance Board has versatility. The ideas are limitless for the kids to play with the rocker balance board. They love setting up a \"lemonade stand\" with their friends in the playroom. We put a mat out and Theo likes to climb and slide down the side. Celia loves jumping from the top. They pretend that they're in the ocean and out for boating adventure. It's so cute to watch them come up with different scenarios and use the rocker to spark their imagination. The Wiwiurka Rocker Balance Board is made with non-toxic materials. The products used for making the toys are safe. The side boards and slats are made of European Birch Plywood. Also, they are painted with non-toxic acrylic paints or wood stains. My Honest Opinions on the Wiwiurka Rocker Balance Board We have lived with rocker for over a year now. During the last several months, it was our most used item in the playroom. It's amazing for rainy days and when the kids need to let go of their energy. It is well constructed and has held up great for us. I have zero complaints and love it so much. I can't wait to add additional items from Wiwiurka to our playroom. Wiwiurka has a wide variety of toys and add ons. We hope to add a ramp and piker triangle to our rocker. The trapeze and swings also look amazing!
