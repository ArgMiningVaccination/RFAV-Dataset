Claims made on products to support or boost the immune system are attractive to the otherwise healthy consumer who may or may not be experiencing certain life stressors. The purpose of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the purported benefits and/or potential harms of select dietary supplement ingredients frequently listed on the labels of products having immune health or related market claims. With a focus on resilience, research questions were related to whether dietary supplement ingredients are efficacious in preserving and protecting immune health in healthy individuals; and when faced with a stressor, whether taking a supplement prophylactically can assist in maintaining health and resisting or bouncing back more quickly. Thirty-nine randomized controlled studies involving populations including children, adults and seniors exposed to stressors, such as air travel, intense exercise, academic stress, and/or exposure to winter weather, met eligibility criteria. The studies included eight of the 27 supplement ingredients identified through a market-driven scoping review. Those ingredients used in single ingredient products were echinacea, elderberry, garlic, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and zinc. Whereas some studies may point to evidence for benefit, specific gaps preclude the authors from making firm statements with regard to the overall evidence-base for these products and ingredients and in answering the research questions. As we move toward a vision of health promotion and resilience rather than a sole focus on disease prevention and treatment, further work in this area of dietary supplements is of utmost importance.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-11-01", "cleaned_text": "Select Dietary Supplement Ingredients for Preserving and Protecting the Immune System in Healthy Individuals: A Systematic Review However, existing research tends to focus on specific disease states and populations rather than health maintenance, optimizing performance, and resilience. Most recently, the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) established the Trans-NIH Resilience Working Group, to \"seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life and reduce illness and disability through the study of resilience\". \"Resilience encompasses the capacity to resist, adapt to, recover, or grow from a challenge\" [ [6](#B6-nutrients-14-04604)]. For most people interested in taking dietary supplements, and in line with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) definition for dietary supplements and how they are supposed to be marketed, resilience outcomes are important to examine. Claims made for \"improving\" the immune response or protecting immune health are attractive to those individuals that are otherwise healthy or perhaps experiencing certain life stressors or challenges. The number of products to potentially choose from seem immeasurable. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Scoping Review for Selection of Dietary Supplement Ingredients [7](#B7-nutrients-14-04604)]; (3) a recent publication on \"immune boosting\" ingredients and dietary supplements that appeared in greater than 10% of webpage advertisements based on Google analytics during the first and second wave of COVID [ [8](#B8-nutrients-14-04604)]; and (4) a published article on popular dietary supplements based on Google search trends related to immunity during the COVID March 2020 outbreak [ [9](#B9-nutrients-14-04604)]. Full details can be found in [Supplementary File S1](#app1-nutrients-14-04604). Ultimately, 27 unique dietary supplement ingredients considered to be frequently contained in dietary supplement products with claims related to immune function were selected. Some of the most common claims identified from these products found on DSLD and Amazon.com consisted of \"immune support\", \"supports booster\", and \"immune defense\". 2.2. Search Strategy and Selection Criteria for Systematic Review [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604)details the search strategy executed. Reference lists of all eligible trials were also examined as other search sources. The authors chose the starting point of 2001 for the evidence generation in an attempt to include ingredients and products likely representative of the market today with current claims for immune health. [Table 1](#nutrients-14-04604-t001)). Primary outcomes for this systematic review included incidence of infection, severity, duration of symptoms for events that did occur, and any reported adverse events. An infection for this systematic review was defined as that related to an acute respiratory infection to include symptoms such as the common cold, cough, congestion, fever, body aches and influenza. The eligibility criteria were constructed in such a way to be consistent with Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) definition for dietary supplements and by marketed health claims on products [ [5](#B5-nutrients-14-04604), [10](#B10-nutrients-14-04604)]. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts accordingly in duplicate (CC, CB). A protocol for this systematic review is registered in Prospero under CRD42021288766. 2.3. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment [11](#B11-nutrients-14-04604)]. 2.4. Data Synthesis and Analysis [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604)).

The search strategy yielded 3928 unique publications once duplicates were removed across databases ( [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604)). Thirty-nine RCT studies (across 43 publications) met eligibility criteria including eight dietary supplement ingredients: echinacea (N = 6; 312) [ [20](#B20-nutrients-14-04604)], garlic (N = 2; n = 266) [ [21](#B21-nutrients-14-04604), [22](#B22-nutrients-14-04604), [23](#B23-nutrients-14-04604)], vitamin A (N = 2; n = 1719) [ [24](#B24-nutrients-14-04604), [25](#B25-nutrients-14-04604)], vitamin C (N = 3; n = 237) [ [26](#B26-nutrients-14-04604), [27](#B27-nutrients-14-04604), [28](#B28-nutrients-14-04604)], vitamin D 652) [ [49](#B49-nutrients-14-04604), [50](#B50-nutrients-14-04604)] and zinc [52](#B52-nutrients-14-04604), [53](#B53-nutrients-14-04604), [54](#B54-nutrients-14-04604), [55](#B55-nutrients-14-04604), [56](#B56-nutrients-14-04604)], involving populations including children, adults and seniors, exposed to stressors described as stressful air travel, intense exercise, academic stress, exposure to winter months, environmental stressors such as poor living environments or where deficiency in certain nutrients is prevalent, and subjects inoculated with a virus. After title and abstract screening, the authors decided to exclude prebiotic and probiotic studies from this current review due to complexities in which these ingredients are categorized/defined in terms of dietary supplements vs. food sources. [ [57](#B57-nutrients-14-04604)] In addition, although studies on mushrooms were identified from the search strategy, they were primarily on beta-glucans either isolated from Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom) and presented as a combination product including vitamin C [ [58](#B58-nutrients-14-04604), [59](#B59-nutrients-14-04604), [60](#B60-nutrients-14-04604)] (and currently off the market according to DSLD), or comparing different sources of beta-glucans. [ [61](#B61-nutrients-14-04604)] These studies were excluded, after careful examination, for being combination products. Furthermore, no published studies were identified meeting the eligibility criteria for astragalus, calcium, ginger, goji, goldenseal, holy basil, slippery elm, turmeric/curcuma, selenium, vitamin B or vitamin K as single ingredient products for immune health. Of the 39 included studies, eight were industry sponsored and eight did not disclose the granting agency or sponsorship.

[Table 2](#nutrients-14-04604-t002)summarizes the evidence collectively and research considerations/gaps discovered. [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604)details all data related to the individual studies characteristics, quality, outcomes, and adverse event reporting. 3.1. Echinacea [1](#B1-nutrients-14-04604), [2](#B2-nutrients-14-04604)]. [15](#B15-nutrients-14-04604)] Five studies involved healthy adults exposed to various stressors; two of these studies involved participants (n = 485) instructed to take different formulations of Echinacea (one using 7.5 mL/day EchinaGuard (from E. purpurea in a 22% alcohol base) [ [17](#B17-nutrients-14-04604)] and the other using three different preparations of 4.5 mL/day of E. angustifolia extracted with either carbon dioxide, 60% or 20% ethanol); [ [19](#B19-nutrients-14-04604)] both studies were for a short-term duration of up to 14 days in length. At day seven, participants from these two studies were inoculated with Rhinovirus Type-39. Another two studies (n = 845) reported stressors during the winter months (i.e., a natural exposure to cold/influenza); specifically, participants were either medical center employees, [ [16](#B16-nutrients-14-04604)] or university students who typically experience 2 colds per year but were healthy at the start of the study. [ [14](#B14-nutrients-14-04604)] Both studies used E. purpurea, one reporting on 2.7 mL/day EchinaForce drops (2400 mg Echinacea) over the course of four months [ [14](#B14-nutrients-14-04604)] and the other disclosing the product simply as \"capsules\" consisting of 1800 mg/day for eight weeks. [ [16](#B16-nutrients-14-04604)] Finally, Tiralongo et al. [ [18](#B18-nutrients-14-04604)] included 175 adults during and after traveling that included long-haul intercontinental flights throughout a five week period. Participants took MediHerb brand Echinacea tablets which contains E. purpurea and E. angustifolia. A matching control, considered as placebo, was sufficiently described in most of these studies. Characteristics of all studies are detailed in [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604). [17](#B17-nutrients-14-04604)]. Criteria not adequately described included allocation concealment and the randomization process; selective reporting appeared in some publications. As per the actual formulation of Echinacea investigated, two of the studies did not disclose the product name or manufacturer of the product, [ [16](#B16-nutrients-14-04604), [19](#B19-nutrients-14-04604)] five did not describe the method of authentication of the raw material or a description of any special testing/purity testing undertaken [ [15](#B15-nutrients-14-04604), [16](#B16-nutrients-14-04604), [17](#B17-nutrients-14-04604), [18](#B18-nutrients-14-04604), [19](#B19-nutrients-14-04604)]. Research into what the active constituents of various species of Echinacea might be ongoing [ [62](#B62-nutrients-14-04604)]. 3.1.1. Outcomes [17](#B17-nutrients-14-04604), [18](#B18-nutrients-14-04604), [19](#B19-nutrients-14-04604)] reporting data for the risk of experiencing an infection for adults exposed to various stressors and taking various formulations of Echinacea, prophylactically as compared to placebo. Studies were consistent however in showing less risk (RR 0.71 to RR 0.82; up to 29%) in developing symptoms when taking Echinacea as compared to placebo ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-14-04604-f001)). [17](#B17-nutrients-14-04604), [19](#B19-nutrients-14-04604)] demonstrated very small to no effect on overall symptom severity throughout the course of the trial when using symptom severity self-report scales (SMD 0.29 to 0.03) ( [Figure 2](#nutrients-14-04604-f002)). Tiralongo reported \"borderline lower respiratory symptom scores compared to placebo [during travel]\" [ [18](#B18-nutrients-14-04604)]. O'Neill reported that the placebo group consistently reported symptoms more often during any given week than the Echinacea group, but \"none of these differences were statistically significant\" [ [16](#B16-nutrients-14-04604)]. [14](#B14-nutrients-14-04604)] whereas O'Neill reported the \"Median number sick days (the sum of the most prevalent symptom each week)\" was 9 days in Echinacea vs. 14 days in control; total of 56 days; (z = 0.42; p = 0.67) [ [16](#B16-nutrients-14-04604)]. [Figure 4](#nutrients-14-04604-f004)) RD 0.02 (95% CI, 0.01, 0.05; p = 0.24). [15](#B15-nutrients-14-04604)]. Using the same statistical analysis techniques as for those adults, a 30% less risk (RR 0.70 (95% CI, 0.52, 0.95; p = 0.02) of developing symptoms was found when taking E. purpurea. A moderate effect was found in the severity of symptoms, in favor of Echinacea (SMD 0.49 (95% CI, 0.77, 0.21; p = 0.001); there was no difference in risk of adverse events between treatment and control (RD 0.04 (95% CI, 0.10, 0.17; p = 0.61). The data also suggest that children taking Echinacea had less confirmed laboratory infections (RR 0.75 (95% CI, 0.61, 0.93; p = 0.008) than controls. Like Jawad [ [14](#B14-nutrients-14-04604)], this study also used the product EchinaForce, and similarly reported a significant reduction in duration, with a mean of 1.4 days less compared to placebo (MD 1.40 (95% reported on other outcomes of well-being, such as sleep quality, mood, or activity. 3.1.2. Adverse Events [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604)details adverse events on record and 10 published case reports. 3.1.3. Quality of the Evidence [14](#B14-nutrients-14-04604)] and most recent study among children [ [15](#B15-nutrients-14-04604)] both reported significant results in favor of Echinacea. Both were also using the same product brand supplied by the same manufacturer in the studies, throughout the winter months. 3.2. Elderberry [2](#B2-nutrients-14-04604)]. [20](#B20-nutrients-14-04604)]. A total of 312 healthy long-flight airplane passengers who were traveling to an overseas destination were given 300 mg capsules of proprietary membrane filtered elderberry (Sambucus nigra L., Haschberg variety; BerryPharma Brand); specifically, adult participants were asked to take 600 mg/day for 10 days before travel and 900 mg/day for five days (e.g., one day before leaving home until 4-5 days after arriving at the destination). A full description of the study's characteristics is detailed in [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604). 3.2.1. Outcomes [Figure 1](#nutrients-14-04604-f001)). The study reported that participants suffering cold episodes while taking elderberry would experience a \"2-day shorter duration of a cold (4.75 days vs. 6.88 days) and a lower symptom severity (mean 21 vs. 34)\" in comparison to those in the placebo group suffering from a cold. Standard deviations were not reported in the publication. The authors also examined other outcomes such as quality of life measures by using SF-12 and the Perceived Stress Scale to evaluate whether subjects were stressed during the trial [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604). 3.2.2. Adverse Events [Figure 4](#nutrients-14-04604-f004)). Reported adverse events included cold-like symptoms and fatigue, however, a causal relationship between elderberry and the events could not be established. Natural Medicines reports that elderberry is generally well-tolerated, with common adverse events being nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, dizziness, numbness, and stupor. Such events may be due to ingestion of raw/unripe elderberries and/or their plant parts, and may be avoided by cooking the elderberry and subsequently eliminating the toxin. The BerryPharma used in the included study is a proprietary elderberry extract. According to Natural Medicines, \"Elderberry fruit extracts have most often been used in doses up to 1200 mg daily for 2 weeks or up to 500 mg daily for up to 6 months in adults\". There is no known tolerable upper limit for elderberry. There have been approximately 27 CAERS adverse events reported from 2014 to 2020. [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604)details adverse events on record and one published case report. 3.3. Garlic [8](#B8-nutrients-14-04604), [9](#B9-nutrients-14-04604)]. [21](#B21-nutrients-14-04604)] reported on 146 adult healthy volunteers from London who were asked to take Allimax containing 180 mg of stabilized allicin per day for 12 weeks during the winter months. The second study [ [22](#B22-nutrients-14-04604), [23](#B23-nutrients-14-04604)] involved 120 healthy men and women recruited from the University of Florida and surrounding community who took Aged Garlic Extract (AGE) powder (4 capsules per day: 2.56 g) for 90 days throughout the cold and flu season which coincided with the stressors of final exams for students. Both studies used a placebo control, not fully described. Characteristics of these studies are detailed in [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604). [22](#B22-nutrients-14-04604)] according to SIGN-50 criteria for risk of bias whereas the other was rated as \"acceptable\" [ [21](#B21-nutrients-14-04604)]. Criteria not sufficiently described included blinding, the randomization process and adequate concealment. It was not clear whether intention to treat analysis were carried out. In addition, although the manufacturer/product name was disclosed in these studies, there was no description of the method of authentication or any special testing of purity undertaken to ensure the supplement contained the materials as reported on the product. 3.3.1. Outcomes [22](#B22-nutrients-14-04604)] ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-14-04604-f001)). Josling did not report on the number of persons experiencing a cold but rather the number of episodes throughout the trial, with 24 episodes in the garlic arm vs. 65 in placebo arm (p < 0.001) [ [21](#B21-nutrients-14-04604)]. For Nantz the total number of symptoms reported during the study was also statistically significant in favor of garlic supplementation (584 total symptoms in garlic arm vs. 737 in placebo; p < 0.001). In contrast, the average number of symptoms per illness incident was not statistically significant (p = 0.536) [ [22](#B22-nutrients-14-04604)]. [21](#B21-nutrients-14-04604)]. No standard deviations were provided in the report. Although the number of days having symptoms was not statistically significant in the Nantz study (p = 0.132), the number of work days missed was significant in favor of garlic (garlic 8 days vs. placebo 19 days; p = 0.035) [ [22](#B22-nutrients-14-04604)]. [22](#B22-nutrients-14-04604)] [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604). 3.3.2. Adverse Events [21](#B21-nutrients-14-04604)] included rash and odor. There was no difference in the risk of experiencing an adverse event in this study (RD 0.04 (95% CI, 0.03, 0.11; p = 0.243) ( [Figure 4](#nutrients-14-04604-f004)). Adverse events were not reported on in the study by Nantz et al. [ [22](#B22-nutrients-14-04604)]. Natural Medicines reports that generally, garlic is well-tolerated with the most common adverse effects being \"abdominal pain, body odor, flatulence, malodorous breath and nausea\" and that serious adverse effects are rare but that \"some case reports have raised concerns about an increased risk of bleeding\". According to Natural Medicines, \"garlic is often standardized to allicin content with concentrations in most formulations ranging from 1.1% to 1.3%\" and \"most often used in doses of 2400 mg daily for 12 months\" in adults. There is no known tolerable upper limit for garlic. Approximately 42 CAERS adverse events have been reported from 2014 to 2020. [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604)details adverse events on record and highlights six published case reports. 3.3.3. Other Studies [63](#B63-nutrients-14-04604)] This study involved two stages, the first looking at the tolerance of allicor (600 mg/day) and its effects on acute respiratory diseases (ARD). The second stage investigated the effects of allicor (300 mg/day) on ARD morbidity during a five month trial in 42 children aged 10-12 years in comparison to 41 placebo treated children and 73 benzimidazole treated children. Allicor was not shown to induce gastrointestinal side effects and at the second stage of the study, allicor reduced ARD morbidity \"1.7 fold compared to placebo and 2.4 fold vs. benzimidazole\". 3.3.4. Quality of the Evidence 3.4. Vitamin A [64](#B64-nutrients-14-04604)]. Although vitamin A deficiency is rare in the US, it is common in many developing countries where children are at high risk of diarrheal diseases and measles. Vitamin A is an ingredient identified on NBJ top 20 ingredients ranked by immunity sales in 2020 [ [7](#B7-nutrients-14-04604)] and also a top ingredient identified as an \"immune boosting\" dietary supplement ingredient appearing in greater than 10% of webpage advertisements based on Google analytics during the 1st and 2nd wave of COVID [ [8](#B8-nutrients-14-04604)]. We were unable to identify any single ingredient products advertised for immune health in our market analysis, however it is commonly listed as an ingredient in multivitamin products for immune health. [25](#B25-nutrients-14-04604)]. The second study involved 445 preschool children (aged 3-6 years) in western China with serum retinal status of 1.15 \u00b1 0.30 \u00b5mol/L, some of whom took 200,000 IU vitamin A (as retinol) once and were monitored over a six months period [ [24](#B24-nutrients-14-04604)]. Characteristics of these studies are detailed in [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604). 3.4.1. Outcomes [25](#B25-nutrients-14-04604)]. Chen et al. reported that the incidence rate of respiratory-related illnesses and runny nose, cough and fever symptoms of the vitamin A group was significantly lower than the placebo group (p < 0.05), and results overall were enhanced in children taking a combination of vitamin A plus iron. Through analysis there was no difference between those taking vitamin A vs. placebo in the risk of getting at least a runny nose, cough or sore throat respiratory related illness (RR 0.95 (95% CI 0.65, Events [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604)details adverse events on record and eight published case reports. 3.4.3. Quality of the Evidence 3.5. Vitamin C [1](#B1-nutrients-14-04604), [2](#B2-nutrients-14-04604)]. It was also found as the most common \"immune boosting\" strategy portrayed on the internet during the COVID-19 pandemic according to a content analysis of Google search results [ [8](#B8-nutrients-14-04604)]. [26](#B26-nutrients-14-04604), [27](#B27-nutrients-14-04604), [28](#B28-nutrients-14-04604)]. It is important to point out that a significant drop in the number of studies on vitamin C has occurred since the 1970s. Early research on vitamin C not captured in this review, suggested that vitamin C had beneficial effects on the common cold (at >2 g/day). [ [65](#B65-nutrients-14-04604)] Today, the tolerable upper intake levels for vitamin C is 2 g/day for ages 19 and above. Hemil\u00e4 [ [66](#B66-nutrients-14-04604)] explained the reason for the reduced interest in vitamin C research being the introduction of antibiotics in the mid-20th century, the belief that vitamin C is \"ineffective\" has been widely spread among general practitioners since three seminal papers published findings of no benefit of vitamin C for the common cold in the 70's. Thus, the use of vitamin C for preventing and treating colds fell into the category of alternative medicine, and hence may amplify \"prejudices against vitamin C\". [28](#B28-nutrients-14-04604)] ascorbic acid prepared by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries [ [26](#B26-nutrients-14-04604)] or a product not fully described but supplied as Twin lab C Caps [ [27](#B27-nutrients-14-04604)]. Van Straten et al., 2002, included 168 healthy participants from the UK, the majority being female (84%) with a mean age of 48 years [ [28](#B28-nutrients-14-04604)]. Constantini et al., 2011, included 39 competitive young swimmers aged 12-17 years from Israel, who trained at least 15 h/week (43% female) [ [26](#B26-nutrients-14-04604)] and Johnston et al., 2014, included 30 healthy men aged 18-35 with plasma vitamin C concentrations less than 45 mol/L [ [27](#B27-nutrients-14-04604)]. All studies used placebo as a comparison. Characteristics of these studies are detailed in [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604). [27](#B27-nutrients-14-04604)] reported on the participant's vitamin C status at baseline, and assessed diet quality by using a food frequency questionnaire throughout the trial. No content analysis or purity testing was described in studies for the dietary supplement used. 3.5.1. Outcomes [27](#B27-nutrients-14-04604)]. In contrast, in healthy participants from the UK (the majority being female) did not appear to differ in the risk (RR 1.03 (95% CI, 0.72, 1.48; p = 0.88) ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-14-04604-f001)), but a statistically significant difference was noted in the number of cold episodes (vitamin C, 37; control, 50; p < 0.05) [ [28](#B28-nutrients-14-04604)]. The study in competitive swimmers from Israel did not show a significant difference in the number of episodes per person or the total number of episodes of respiratory infections experienced [ [26](#B26-nutrients-14-04604)]. [26](#B26-nutrients-14-04604), [27](#B27-nutrients-14-04604)]. Both showed a reduction in severity in favor of vitamin C, but it did not reach statistical significance. Although wide confidence intervals, the effect for men with marginal vitamin C status was moderate (SMD 0.60 (95% CI, 1.37, 0.16; p = 0.11) [ [27](#B27-nutrients-14-04604)]. In addition, whereas the effect was insignificant and small for competitive swimmers overall (SMD 0.24), when looking at a sub-group of only males, this difference became significant in favor of vitamin C in lowering the severity of symptoms with a medium effect size (SMD 0.67 (95% CI, 1.24, [Figure 3](#nutrients-14-04604-f003)). Johnston et al. also described other measures of daily living and physical activity, reported in [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604). 3.5.2. Adverse Events [28](#B28-nutrients-14-04604)]. There was no difference in the risk of experiencing an adverse event taking vitamin C or placebo (RD 0.02 (95% CI, 0.12, 0.07); p = 0.63 ( [Figure 4](#nutrients-14-04604-f004)). Natural Medicines reports that generally, vitamin C is well-tolerated and the most common adverse effects include abdominal cramps, heartburn, headache, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting; these effects are more likely to occur at doses above the tolerable upper intake level of 2 g/day. Approximately 186 CAERS adverse events have been reported from 2014 to 2020. [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604)details adverse events on record and five published case reports. 3.5.3. Quality of the Evidence [65](#B65-nutrients-14-04604), [66](#B66-nutrients-14-04604), [67](#B67-nutrients-14-04604), [68](#B68-nutrients-14-04604)]. 3.6. Vitamin D [69](#B69-nutrients-14-04604)]. Vitamin D dietary supplements are commonly used to prevent or treat such deficiency or in persons with weak or brittle bones. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, vitamin D was found as one of the top \"immune boosting\" strategies portrayed on the internet and the interest and use of vitamin D increased among individuals interested in immune-related nutrients [ [8](#B8-nutrients-14-04604), [9](#B9-nutrients-14-04604)]. It was also one of the top 20 ingredients identified by the NBJ 2020 report on immune health dietary supplements [ [7](#B7-nutrients-14-04604)]. [29](#B29-nutrients-14-04604)]; seven studies involved adults with mean baseline levels ranging from 58 to 75 nmol/L [ [30](#B30-nutrients-14-04604), [36](#B36-nutrients-14-04604), [39](#B39-nutrients-14-04604), [42](#B42-nutrients-14-04604), [43](#B43-nutrients-14-04604), [45](#B45-nutrients-14-04604), [46](#B46-nutrients-14-04604)]; during military training (one reporting \"25% sufficient\" and the other a mean of 78 mol/L at baseline) [ [34](#B34-nutrients-14-04604), [38](#B38-nutrients-14-04604)]; two involved taekwondo (mean baseline of 31 nmol/L) [ [37](#B37-nutrients-14-04604)] or swimmer athletes with mean levels of 60 mol/L [ [31](#B31-nutrients-14-04604)]; two studies involved either high school [ [47](#B47-nutrients-14-04604)] or university students [ [33](#B33-nutrients-14-04604)] where the baseline levels were not disclosed; and four studies involved children with mean baseline levels ranging from 30 to 67.5 nmol/L [ [32](#B32-nutrients-14-04604), [35](#B35-nutrients-14-04604), [40](#B40-nutrients-14-04604), [48](#B48-nutrients-14-04604)]. Vitamin D was administered in monthly doses at 200,000 tapering to 100,000 IU per month (provided by Tishcon) for up to approximately 1.6 years in two studies [ [29](#B29-nutrients-14-04604), [42](#B42-nutrients-14-04604)]; in weekly doses at 10,000 to 20,000 IU/week in five studies (provided by the longest study lasting five years [ [36](#B36-nutrients-14-04604)]; the remaining eleven studies provided vitamin D in daily doses ranging from 400 IU per day for children [ [35](#B35-nutrients-14-04604)], Japanese adults [ [45](#B45-nutrients-14-04604)] and men during military training [ [38](#B38-nutrients-14-04604)] to up to 5000 IU per day in male athletes with mean levels of 31 mol/L at baseline [ [37](#B37-nutrients-14-04604)], for a study duration up to one year (provided by Solgar, DSM, Pure Encapsulations, Minisun, BioTech, placebo control was sufficiently described in most of these studies. Characteristics of all studies are detailed in [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604). [30](#B30-nutrients-14-04604)]. Inadequate description of allocation concealment and intention-to-treat analyses were common reasons for downgrading study quality. The majority of studies disclosed the products by name and assessed baseline levels of vitamin D among participants. 3.6.1. Outcomes [29](#B29-nutrients-14-04604), [42](#B42-nutrients-14-04604)]. In adults with mean baseline levels of 60+ nmol/L given weekly doses of 20,000 IU vitamin D throughout the winter season and up to five years total, (N = 2) there did not appear to be any treatment effect on infection risk for respiratory tract infections [ [36](#B36-nutrients-14-04604), [46](#B46-nutrients-14-04604)]. However, one study reported that when stratified by baseline levels below 40 (n = 4) \"a 44% reduction in infection risk\" to include other infections besides respiratory tract infections was noted [ [46](#B46-nutrients-14-04604)]. University students taking 10,000 IU/week vitamin D for eight weeks during peak rates of rhinovirus (N = 1) showed reduced laboratory confirmed infections (RR 0.54 (95% CI, 0.34, 0.84; p = 0.007), but the risk of self-reported symptomatic upper respiratory infections only trended toward significance (RR 0.79 (95% CI, 0.61, 1.04; p = 0.09) [ [33](#B33-nutrients-14-04604)]. Children in Vietnam (N = 1, mean levels of 67.5) who were taking 14,000 IU/week up to one year showed a reduced risk of experiencing influenza A, B or other respiratory illnesses, but not influenza alone (RR 0.85 (95% CI, 0.72, 1.00; p = 0.053) [ [40](#B40-nutrients-14-04604)], whereas children in Mongolia (N = 1, 30 mol/L) taking the same amount for three years did not experience a lower risk of acute respiratory infections (RR 1.00 (95% CI, 0.98, 1.02; p studies [ [35](#B35-nutrients-14-04604), [47](#B47-nutrients-14-04604), [48](#B48-nutrients-14-04604)] (N = 3) in children or high school students outside the US and taking daily doses of 400-2000 IU vitamin D up to 5 months throughout winter, showed no difference in experiencing an influenza-like illness in general (RR 0.96, 1.26), but studies report that vitamin D may influence the risk of influenza A \"in certain subgroups\" [ [48](#B48-nutrients-14-04604)] or \"during the first month\" [ [47](#B47-nutrients-14-04604)] of taking vitamin D. Adolescent competitive swimmers in Israel taking 2000 IU/d (N = 1.60 mol/L) did not experience a statistically less risk of suffering an infection compared to placebo [ [31](#B31-nutrients-14-04604)]. (RR 0.86 (95% CI, 0.62, 1.18; p = 0.349) A study in young Finnish men during military training who took 400 IU/day vitamin D for six months (mean 78 nmol/L) showed preventative benefit in the risk of experiencing an infection (RR 0.76 (95% CI, 0.58, 1.00; p = 0.049) [ [38](#B38-nutrients-14-04604)]. Other studies in adults inside and outside the US (vitamin D levels ranging from means of 58-82.5 mol/L) who took vitamin D in doses of 400 IU to 2000 IU per day throughout the winter months and up to one year duration did not show any statistical difference in the risk of experiencing an infection [ [30](#B30-nutrients-14-04604), [39](#B39-nutrients-14-04604), [43](#B43-nutrients-14-04604), [45](#B45-nutrients-14-04604)] (RR ranging from 0.77 to 0.99, with confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect) (N = 4) ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-14-04604-f001)). [37](#B37-nutrients-14-04604)]. Small to no effect was shown in the remaining studies, in adults and adolescent swimmers (SMD ranging from 0.31 ( [Figure 2](#nutrients-14-04604-f002)). One study, for which data were not available for extraction, did report on British army recruits (25% sufficient) who took 1090 IU for four weeks during training followed by 460 IU for an additional eight weeks. They noted that vitamin D \"reduced the severity of peak URTI symptoms by 15% [p < 0.05]\" and that participants supplementation with levels below 50 mol/L \"had 21% lower peak severity\". This study did combine vitamin D supplementation and simulated sunlight groups together when reporting results but stated \"no difference between these groups when combined\" [ [34](#B34-nutrients-14-04604)]. [31](#B31-nutrients-14-04604), [33](#B33-nutrients-14-04604), [39](#B39-nutrients-14-04604)] Harrison et al. reported \"Compared with placebo, vitamin D supplementation reduced the days with URTI by 36% (p < 0.05); p < 0.05\" [ [34](#B34-nutrients-14-04604)] and Shimizu et al. reported the median days duration was 10 days vs. 13 days for 400 IU/d compared to placebo, although not statistically significant (p = 0.061) [ [45](#B45-nutrients-14-04604)]. All other studies involving adults regardless of the amount or duration of taking vitamin D showed no change in duration of symptoms [ [42](#B42-nutrients-14-04604), [43](#B43-nutrients-14-04604), [46](#B46-nutrients-14-04604)]. Other studies among children did not report on duration of symptoms. [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604). 3.6.2. Adverse Events [39](#B39-nutrients-14-04604), ( [Figure 4](#nutrients-14-04604-f004)) Natural Medicines reports that generally, orally, vitamin D is well-tolerated and that serious adverse effects are rare but in \"excessive doses can lead to vitamin D toxicity with symptoms of hypercalcemia and also sometimes azotemia and anemia\". According to the IOM guidelines, tolerable upper intake levels for vitamin D are 4000 IU per day for individuals nine years and older, although there is evidence of adverse events with doses as low as 2000 IU/day in some populations [ [70](#B70-nutrients-14-04604)]. Approximately 637 CAERS adverse events have been reported from 2014 to 2020. [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604)details adverse events on record and 14 published case reports. 3.6.3. Quality of the Evidence 3.7. Vitamin E [71](#B71-nutrients-14-04604)]. In dietary supplements, vitamin E is often promoted for \"immune health\" and \"antioxidant support\". Vitamin E was found as a frequent ingredient in the DSLD with claims for immune health. [49](#B49-nutrients-14-04604), [50](#B50-nutrients-14-04604)]. Participants were divided into four treatment groups: multivitamin and minerals, vitamin E alone, both combined or a placebo. Participants assigned to vitamin E took 2 capsules of 200 mg/dL alpha-tocopheryl acetate per day for up to 15 months, to include at least three winter months. Placebo was described as containing soybean oil. Characteristics of this study are described in [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604). 3.7.1. Outcomes [Figure 1](#nutrients-14-04604-f001)). Among persons experiencing an infection, the individuals who received vitamin E had longer total illness duration (19 (9-37) vs. 14 (6-29) days [interquartile range reported], more symptoms (6 (3-8) vs. 4 (3-8), and a higher frequency of fever (36.7% vs. 25.2%) and restriction of activity than those not taking vitamin E [ [49](#B49-nutrients-14-04604), [50](#B50-nutrients-14-04604)]. [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604). 3.7.2. Adverse Events [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604)details adverse events on record and two published case reports. 3.8. Zinc [8](#B8-nutrients-14-04604)]. In addition, it was one of the top 20 ingredients identified by the NBJ 2020 report on immune health dietary supplement ingredients [ [7](#B7-nutrients-14-04604)]. Zinc either alone or present in combination products is popularly advertised to \"support immune system function\" and \"immune health\". Homeopathic products often advertise zinc as a \"pre-cold remedy\". [53](#B53-nutrients-14-04604)], elemental zinc [ [55](#B55-nutrients-14-04604)], and zinc sulphate supplied by Berko Ilac Company, Turkey [ [51](#B51-nutrients-14-04604)] or a Peruvian pharmaceutical Lab (Instituto Quimioterapico, Peru) [ [54](#B54-nutrients-14-04604)]. According to Kurugol et al. [ [51](#B51-nutrients-14-04604)] if children experienced symptoms, they were given 30 mg/day for up to 10 days rather than 15 mg/day during the prevention stage. One study involved 40 male and female US Air Force cadets during the cold and flu season who were exposed to a number of stressful situations during their training; participants took 15 mg zinc supplied through a \"FDA licensed clinical specialty pharmacy (FL, USA)\" for seven months duration [ [56](#B56-nutrients-14-04604)]. Finally, one study involved 50 healthy elderly adults aged 55-87 years, some of whom were zinc-deficient and stressed oxidatively more so compared to younger adults. Subjects took 45 mg/day elemental zinc for 12 months supplied by Labcatal Laboratories, Paris, France [ [52](#B52-nutrients-14-04604)]. A matching control, considered as placebo, was sufficiently described in most of these studies. Characteristics of all studies are detailed in [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604). [52](#B52-nutrients-14-04604), [55](#B55-nutrients-14-04604), [56](#B56-nutrients-14-04604)] and acceptable [ [53](#B53-nutrients-14-04604), [54](#B54-nutrients-14-04604)] and high quality [ [51](#B51-nutrients-14-04604)] in the other three studies, according to SIGN-50 risk of bias. Methodological concerns included the randomization process not being adequately described, allocation concealment, blinding and whether intention-to-treat was performed in studies. Not all studies reported on the zinc levels of participants at baseline and whether tests were done to confirm the supplement contained the amount of zinc reported on the Supplement Facts label. 3.8.1. Outcomes [51](#B51-nutrients-14-04604)]. Another study showed no difference between children taking zinc compared to placebo in those experiencing at least one symptom [ [53](#B53-nutrients-14-04604)] ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-14-04604-f001)). However, this study did show less risk of experiencing two or more symptoms throughout the three months (RR 0.46 (95% CI, 0.19, 1.12; p = 0.087) [ [53](#B53-nutrients-14-04604)]. The other two studies in children did not report on the number of participants experiencing symptoms but did report on the number of episodes experienced. Vakili et al. [ [55](#B55-nutrients-14-04604)] in 2009 reported that the average common cold episodes per child during the study was 1.37 episodes among those taking zinc compared to 3.15 episodes among placebo (p < 0.001). In an environment where malaria is prevalent, zinc supplementation did not impact the incidence of respiratory infections [ [54](#B54-nutrients-14-04604)]. A study involving 40 cadets exposed to stressors during the winter months did not show a difference between groups in terms of physician-diagnosed cases of infection, however self-reported symptoms through a weekly survey showed that participants taking zinc experienced more symptom-free episodes compared to the placebo group (p = 0.01) [ [56](#B56-nutrients-14-04604)]. Significantly less risk of experiencing an infection was shown in one study evaluating the effect of zinc in seniors over a 12 month period (RR 0.33 (95% CI, 0.17, 1](#nutrients-14-04604-f001)). [51](#B51-nutrients-14-04604), [53](#B53-nutrients-14-04604)]. The mean difference in cold symptoms in the zinc group compared to the placebo was MD 0.60 (95% CI, 0.78, 0.42; p = 0.0001) in one study, [ [51](#B51-nutrients-14-04604)] where the other reported that the median duration of at least 2 symptoms (in days, (IQR) for those taking zinc was 0.0 (0-1.0) whereas the placebo group was 1.0 (0-5.3) p < 0.01 [ [53](#B53-nutrients-14-04604)] ( [Figure 3](#nutrients-14-04604-f003)). Vakilli et al. reported on days missing school, which was significantly reduced for those taking zinc (MD 0.80 (95% CI, 1.21, 0.39; p < 0.0001) [ [55](#B55-nutrients-14-04604)]. The studies in cadets and seniors did not evaluate duration of symptoms ( [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604)). [Supplementary File = 0.77) ( [Figure 4](#nutrients-14-04604-f004)). Natural Medicines reports that generally, orally, zinc is well-tolerated in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (40 mg daily for adults). Most common adverse effects include abdominal cramps, diarrhea, metallic taste, nausea and vomiting, which are commonly dose-related. There have been approximately 249 CAERS adverse events reported from 2014 to 2020. [Supplementary File S2](#app1-nutrients-14-04604)details adverse events on record and three published case reports. 3.8.3. Quality of the Evidence 4. Discussion [Table 2](#nutrients-14-04604-t002)details the summary of the evidence for echinacea, elderberry, garlic, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E and zinc, in an attempt to answer the research questions posed for review. Whereas some studies may point to evidence for benefit or perhaps even no benefit, specific gaps preclude the authors from making firm statements in regard to the overall evidence-base for these products and ingredients, and in answering the research questions overall that require diverse researchers and scientific collaborations, for forging the path forward in understanding whether the science would match the claims made for dietary supplements that protect immune health. As part of this project, an expert panel was assembled and convened to review this evidence and discuss research considerations and gaps. Using a modified Delphi process, the expert panel established a set of priorities and recommendations for future research based on the state of the science and in collaboration with key stakeholders, reported elsewhere (currently in draft). [Supplementary File S1](#app1-nutrients-14-04604)). Most of these reviews focus on patients with inflammatory conditions, such as atopic dermatitis, periodontal diseases, ulcerative colitis, etc., or other disease states or conditions such as cancer and heart disease. Some look at \"prevention and treatment\" of respiratory conditions. Previous reviews suggest that echinacea might have a preventative benefit for upper respiratory tract infections, including the common cold, but whether any reported effect is clinically meaningful is debatable [ [72](#B72-nutrients-14-04604), [73](#B73-nutrients-14-04604)]. Elderberry may reduce the duration and severity of symptoms in individuals taking elderberry as a treatment for influenza-like symptoms. Research studying elderberry prophylactically is pointed out as requiring more information in order to make any conclusions [ [74](#B74-nutrients-14-04604), [75](#B75-nutrients-14-04604)]. Only one review (involving a single study) evaluating the evidence on garlic for the prevention or treatment of the common cold was identified [ [76](#B76-nutrients-14-04604)]. Reviews on vitamin A suggest that the effect on respiratory infections could differ by age and circumstance; and that excessive amounts could actually increase the risk of infection in children who are already healthy, without vitamin A deficiency or malnourishment [ [67](#B67-nutrients-14-04604), [77](#B77-nutrients-14-04604), [78](#B78-nutrients-14-04604), [79](#B79-nutrients-14-04604)]. Reviews on vitamin C suggest that preventative benefits may be dependent on gender (males), environmental conditions and certain stressors an individual may be exposed to; this will require future attention [ [66](#B66-nutrients-14-04604), [67](#B67-nutrients-14-04604), [68](#B68-nutrients-14-04604)]. A number of systematic reviews have looked at vitamin D, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic [ [67](#B67-nutrients-14-04604), [78](#B78-nutrients-14-04604), [80](#B80-nutrients-14-04604), [81](#B81-nutrients-14-04604), [82](#B82-nutrients-14-04604), [83](#B83-nutrients-14-04604)]. Sub-group analyses have shown that vitamin D may be beneficial as a daily dose over a short-term, but for which individuals with which baseline levels or involving what stressors is not yet fully understood. Previous reviews including vitamin E do not appear to show any benefit for the prevention or treatment of respiratory infections [ [67](#B67-nutrients-14-04604), [78](#B78-nutrients-14-04604), [84](#B84-nutrients-14-04604), [85](#B85-nutrients-14-04604)]. Reviews on zinc (including lozenges and nasal sprays in addition to capsules and tablets) suggest a reduction in the days with symptoms with zinc but less known about the preventative benefits [ [67](#B67-nutrients-14-04604), [78](#B78-nutrients-14-04604), [86](#B86-nutrients-14-04604), [87](#B87-nutrients-14-04604)]. Limitations noted in reviews and consistent with our review include methodological concerns and clinical heterogeneity in many different preparations tested and among different types of individuals. Applicability to Practice [88](#B88-nutrients-14-04604), [89](#B89-nutrients-14-04604)]. 5.

Individuals with chronic conditions or taking medications were not considered eligible. |Dietary supplement ingredients||Dietary supplement ingredients selected from the market driven approach and delivered as a single ingredient dietary supplement product. For eligibility, the authors followed the Food and Drug Administration definition for dietary supplements. Nasal sprays and lozenges were not considered dietary supplements under this review. Studies including dietary supplements as a treatment were not eligible, but taken prophylactically, to preserve, protect or recover from, taken prior to any sign of infection or symptom occurring.| If the participants included in a study were sick at the time of enrollment, those studies were not eligible. In addition, if the participants were taking other medications concurrently with the dietary supplement, then those studies were not eligible (e.g., asthma medications, other prescription drugs).

Males and perhaps those exposed to intense exercise may benefit from less severe symptoms and reduced duration of illness. Vitamin C appears safe below the tolerable upper limit of 2 g/day. - Only one study looked at vitamin C levels in the body and tracked diet throughout the trial - The amount and timing for vitamin C to take prophylactically or therapeutically is not fully understood - The size of any effect of vitamin C may be dependent upon specific participant characteristics or stressors [42](#B42-nutrients-14-04604)] and seniors [ [29](#B29-nutrients-14-04604)] (n = 5432, some with inadequate levels) 200,000 tapering to 100,000/month (3300 IU/d) Tishcon, up to 1.6 years unchanged when the analysis included winter season or baseline 25-OHD levels No. episodes: T = 593; C = 611 and Severity per episode, median (IQR); T = 171 (86-295); C = 183 (97-316); p = 0.48 T = 12 (8), n = 366; C = 12 (7); n = 365; p = 0.76 and No. days missed work per episode T = 0.76 (1.25); C = 0.76 (1.26) p = 0.82 Weekly doses of vitamin D for university students during the winter showed some reduced risk of infection. Other 2 studies in adults with adequate levels did not. Children taking weekly doses in Vietnam showed reduced risk of infections but not for influenza alone while children in Mongolia with inadequate levels showed no effect for risk of infection over a longer time period. 4 studies in children taking daily vitamin D during the winter months did not show significantly reduced risk, severity or duration of illness. 3 studies involving either male during military training or taekwondo training show either less risk of infection or reduced symptom severity when taking daily vitamin D. Four studies in adults with mean adequate levels, taking daily vitamin D during the winter months showed no significant benefit in risk, severity or duration. Vitamin D appears safe when taken below the UL - Certain stressors or sub-populations may be insufficiently studied to understand the precision of results beyond the \"winter months\" stressors - It is challenging to know whether those deficient benefit from vitamin D for respiratory infections when a mean serum level is reported and sub-analysis is done for different levels that is not adequately powered to detect meaningful changes.
