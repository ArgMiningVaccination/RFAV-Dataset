This defense is carried out by directly eliminating the aggressor by specific cells (white blood cells) by devouring the intruder (phagocytosis), or by producing different defense substances such as enzymes, cytokines, or antimicrobial peptides. How is the immune system formed? The concept of two barriers of immunity. [The immune system](/en/15649-lero-premunil-systeme-immunitaire-30-capsules.html) exists in all living beings and is made up of two barriers which have a complementary role: - The first barrier, innate immunity, is formed by cells of our tissues such as skin cells (keratinocytes) and [cells of immunity](/en/22596-immuno4-stimulant-naturel-de-l-immunite-bio-30-gelules.html) , such as white blood cells (polynuclear cells and macrophages). The role of this immunity is to eliminate, not specifically, but instantly, the aggressor by digesting it (phagocytosis) and by causing an inflammatory reaction. The constituents of this inflammation (enzymes, free radicals, cytokines) will contribute to the elimination of the intruder. Once digested, the foreign body debris will be used to more specifically activate cells (lymphocytes) of the 2nd [barrier of immunity](/en/22596-immuno4-stimulant-naturel-de-l-immunite-bio-30-gelules.html) . - The second barrier, adaptive immunity, is specific and relies on cells called T and B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes, once educated, will specifically recognize the aggressor or its debris, then will respond appropriately to suppress any intruder who would have survived the action of the 1st barrier of immunity. Each aggressor will then be eliminated by the cytotoxic action of the T lymphocytes and by the action of the antibodies produced by the B lymphocytes. During the first meeting with the aggressor, the lymphocyte response is quite slow compared to the response of innate immunity, which is more immediate. However, in the case of re-aggression, the lymphocyte response will be much faster, because the lymphocytes have kept the memory of the aggressor, unlike the cells of innate immunity which do not have \"immune memory\".
