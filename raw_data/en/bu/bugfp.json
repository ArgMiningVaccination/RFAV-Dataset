We believe the Bible is the inspired, inerrant Word of God. (2 Tim. 3:16-17; 2 Pet. 1-20). We believe God is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. (Gen. 1; John 1:3; Col. 1:16; Heb. 1:3). We believe Jesus is both Lord and Christ, to the glory of God the Father. (Acts 1:9-11; 2:36; Phil. 2:9-11). We believe that whosoever will confess with their mouth that Jesus is Lord and believes in their heart God raised Him from the dead shall be saved. (Rom. 10:9-10; Acts 2:21; 1 John 1:12). We believe that the Holy Spirit is sent by Jesus to indwell, empower, teach, guide and comfort believers. (Luke 12:12; Rom. 8-11; John 16:13; Acts 1:7-8, 9:31). We believe that the Lord Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection from the dead provided for the healing of the spirit, soul, and bodies of all peoples. We believe in the imminent return of Jesus Christ, who will come to rule as King upon the earth with the saints. (Acts 1:9-11; 1Thess. 4:13-5:2; Rev. 19:11-21, 22:20).

Here are his conclusions: So what is biblical naturopathic medicine? It's untrained, unqualified, unlicensed practitioners that believe their religion makes them immune from government oversight. It's people that think two individuals signing a contract to call something what it's not prevents them from being subject to laws designed to keep people safe. It's delusional people that don't want to be held accountable for the things they do, doing things they shouldn't. It's people that are so arrogant to think that their holy book, written thousands of years before we discovered germ theory, during a time when seizures and schizophrenia were attributed to demonic possession, by authors that never intended for it to be used as a medical text, gives them superior knowledge to those of us who respect our patients enough to spend years actually studying medicine and who are willing to be held accountable for our actions. It's biblical literalists that disingenuously omit the abortion potion recipe provided by the LORD in Numbers 5 [2](https://schadhayes.substack.com/p/wtf-is-biblical-naturopathic-medicine#footnote-2) from their biblical naturopathy curriculum, while voting for legislators who put the lives of their constituents at risk by criminalizing abortion and putting a bounty on the heads of pregnant people and the physicians that have devoted their careers to caring for them. __________________________ In a nutshell: Biblical Naturopathy is yet another SCAM that I recommend avoiding. Why? Because it is dangerous nonsense. "}
