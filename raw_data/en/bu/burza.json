Description of the herbal substance(s), herbal preparation(s) or combinations thereof Herbal substance(s) Centella asiatica (L.) Urban is a stoloniferous perennial herb belonging to the plant family Apiaceae (Umbelliferae), which contains 20 different species. It is a sl ender, creeping plant, rooting at the nodes, growing in the damp areas in different tropical countries. The leaves are very variable in size; the petiole is usually 5 -10, even 15 times longer than the lamina, which is 10 -40 mm long and 20 -40 mm, sometimes up to 70 mm, wide. Dried, fragmented aerial parts contain minimum 6.0% of total triterpenoid derivatives, expressed as asiaticoside with Hydrocotyle asiatica L. In German, the medicinal plant is also known by the colloquial name of \"Indischer Wassernabel\". Further names used Gong Gen (Chinese), Blasteostimulina (asiaticoside) (Spanish). In India it is commonly known \"Jal Brahmi\" or 'Mandookaparni' or Gotu al. 2000). According to the European Pharmacopoeia the herbal substance consists of the dried, fragmented aerial parts, containing minimum 6% of total triterpenoid derivatives, expressed n. 1498). In addition to about 0.1% essential oils and other volatile constituents, Centella asiatica contain s a wide range of metabolites . These derive mostly from the metabolism of phenylpropane and acetate and belong to the flavonoid and terpenes (Brinkhaus et al. 2000). The species is most known for its high content of pentacyclic triterpenoids (C30), collect ively referred also madecassoside, and their aglycones, asiatic and madecassic acids, are most abundant pentacyclic triterpenoi ds in Centella . Saponins account for up to 8% of the dry mass of the herb. The levels of saponins and sapogenins vary widely depending on the geographical origin, genetic, environmental and growth conditions. Centella asiatica contains many phenolic constituents, including flavonoids, epicatechin, kaempfer ol, quercetin and related glycosides (Gray et al. 2018 a). The plant is also rich in chlorogenic acids, a diverse group of compounds formed by quinic acid esterified to cinnamic acid derivatives. The plant contains about 36% of volatiles and fatty oils. The lignoceric, oleic, present in Centella asiatica oil comprises of terpenic acetate, while other p 2015). A small percentage (0.21%) of pulegone was found in the essential oil (Joshi & Cha turvedi 2013). The substances of potential therapeu tic interest are the saponin -containing triterpene acids and their sugar e sters, the most important being asiatic acid, madecassic acid and the three asiaticosides, asiaticoside, asiaticoside A and asiatic oside B (Fig. 1 - Brinkhaus et al. 2000). struc tures of 2,3,6,23 -tetrahydroxyolean - 12-ene-28-oic acid (Sahu et al. 1989). Fig. 1 (from Brinkhaus et al. 2000) Herbal prepa ration(s) Aqueous extracts of Centella asiatica , as well as refined and purified extracts have been used. Literature reports studies on the following extra cts: TECA, TTFCA and TTF, all of the aglycons (asiatic acid an d madecassic acid). In particular clinical studies were published describing the use of the following preparations: TTFCA (total triterpenoid fraction extracts TECA and TTF CA in literature are reported to contain 30% of asiatic acid and 30% of madecassic acid, while the extract TTF is reported to comprise 60% of asiatic acid and madecassic acid in a ratio that is not clearly defined. In all extracts , the remaining 40% is purified as iaticoside (Brinkhaus et al. 2000). Information comi ng from literature and licensed medicinal products confirms that all the above mentioned TECA, TTFCA, T TF as well as ETCA and CATTF are different acronyms to designate the same extract, commercially known with different brand names containing 40% of asiati coside and 60% of asiatic acid and madecassic acid. Other herbal substances/ preparations historically in medicinal use include powdered fresh and dried leaves, powdered dried whole plant (without roots), alcoholic and aqueous extracts. Combinations of herb al substance(s) and/or herbal preparation(s) including a description of vitamin(s) and/or mineral(s) as ingredients of traditional combination herbal medicinal products assessed, where applicable.

Search and assessment methodology This asses sment report reviews the scientific literature data available for Centella asiatica and from the WHO monograph, European Pharmacopoeia monograph, PubMed, EMA library, internet as well as available inform ation on products marketed in the European Community , including pharmaceutical forms, indications, posology and methods of administration. The keywords fields were used. The following databases were searc hed in November non -EU regulatory authorities: market overview up to January 2019. 2. Data on medicinal use 2.1. Information about products on the market 2.1.1. Information about products on the market in the EU/EEA Member States Information on medicinal products marketed in the EU/EEA An inquiry to get information on herbal medicinal products containing Centella asiatica was sent to HMPC m embers in December 2018. There are no authorised medicinal products containing herbal preparations of Centella asiatica as a monocomponent. However, m edicinal products containing standardized and highly purified Centella asiatica preparations are authorise d and marketed in Europe with full application in Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain with the following indications: Treatment of moderate or benign problems in w ound formation such as atonic wounds (BE); Treatment of hypertrophic scars, ke loids in active phase (BE) Local treatment for granulation phase of wounds, cutaneous ulcers and cutaneous gangrene (FR) Improvement of symptoms of stasis (FR) Potent wound healing agent (induce Symptoms of venous insuffi ciency and capillary fragility (IT) Treatment of leg ulcers, decubitus sc abs, gangrene, defective scars, fistula, traumatic and surgical wounds, burns, skin grafts, r adio-dermites, ORL, ophthalmology and gynaecology cutaneous - mucosal injury (PT) Adjuvant o n the cicatrisation of skin injuries (PT) Epithelizant agent, to heal injuries, scars, keloid scars, burns (ES) Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 7/68 These medicinal products are marketed with differe nt trade names as tablets (10 mg or 30 , of extract/100 g of mass; 2 g of mass/dm2). From the comparison of the information on production and testing of the active substance provided by Member States where these products are authorized, it clearl y appears that all the above mentioned medicinal products contain the same type of extract, which is purified, fractioned and enriched in triterpenic acid and tri terpenic sugar ester fractions to reach about the 40% of asiaticosides and about the 60% of th e triterpenic acids: asiatic acid and madecassic acid. TECA is obtain ed by extreme purification steps, which involve chemical treatments that remove the herbal ma trix. The final extract is a recombination of a highly refined extract with an isolated consti tuent and the natural proportion of the components is not maintained. Therefore, based on the information on manufacturing process, the HMPC is of the opinion tha t TECA extract cannot be classified as an herbal preparation due to the manufacturing steps an d composition (see EMA/HMPC/579663/2009 Public statement on Centella asiatica (L.) Urban, herba). Hard caps ules containing 30 mg of asiatic acid are authorised in Portugal since 1989 for prevention and recovery of venous insufficiency: heavy legs, fatigability, oedem a, itching, pain and leg ulcer. The posology is one hard capsule (30 mg) 2 times/day . Informatio n on relevant combination medicinal products marketed in the EU/EEA Not applicable Information on other products marketed in the EU/EEA (where relevant) Food s upplements containing different preparations of Centella asiatica are on the market in the Europ ean Community , as well as in cosmetics. Food supplements are available in several countries with healing claims related to the microcircu lation and the tissue draining. No information about the type of extracts used in food supplements is available. 2.1.2. Inform ation on products on the market outside the EU/EEA Not applicable 2.2. Information on documented medicinal use and historical data from litera ture Centella asiatica is an ethnomedical plant used in different continents by diverse ancient cultures and tribal gro ups. The plant is native in Asian countries like Sri Lanka and Malaysia as well as in Madagascar and South Africa . Centella asiatica has been referred to in the ancient traditional Chinese Shennong Herbal about 2,000 years ago and in Indian Ayurvedic medic ine about 3,000 years ago. The Chinese prescribed the leaves in curing leucorrhoea and toxic feve r while in India, this plant is used in the Ayurvedic system of medicine, usually described under the name of Mandukaparn i, to treat various diseases: asthma, bronchitis, dropsy, elephantiasis, gastric cat arrh, kidney troubles, leprosy, leucorrhoea, skin diseases and urethritis (Husain et al. 2007). In 1852, Boileau, a French doctor in Mauritius, pointed out the use of the plant (called Bavilacqua in Mauritius) in the treatment of leprosy; in his opinion the use of the whole plant was preferable to that of the leaves alone. A few years later, a number of lepers were treated with the drug in the Madras Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 8/68 pharmacopoeia. The applic ation of Centella asiatica causes a feeling of warmth and tingling of the skin, especially that of the hands and feet. After a few d ays there is a feeling of heat, which is often hard to bear. The capillary circulation is accelerated, and after a week the appetite begins to improve, the skin gradually becomes softer, its thickenings are repelled and it regains the ability to perspire (Madaus 1938). In Madagascar, the plant was also used to treat leprosy (Sahu et al. 1989). The use of Centella asiatica , main ly leaves and whole plant, in dermatological conditions suc h as eczema, psoriasis, lupus was reported by Madaus (1938). In Malaysia, although this herb is commonly eaten fresh as a vegetable (salad), especially among the Malaysia communities, it is also sa id to have beneficial effects in improving memory and in treating mental fatigue, anxiety, and eczema (Abdul Hamid et al. 2002). Fresh extracts of th e plant have been used by the people of Java and the Malay Peninsula for many years, as both topical and in ternal agents, for healing of wounds and constituent of brain tonics for the cognitive retard (Kartnig, 1988). In folk medicine dif ferent uses of Centella asiatica herb, not supported by experimental or cli nical data, were reported Centella was used and \"brain tonic\" agent (WHO monographs, 1999). Poultices have been used to treat con tusions, closed fractures, sprains, and furunculosis (WHO monographs, 1999). In Asia, the drug is used to enhance urination, for phy sical and mental exhaustion, diarrhea, eye diseases, inflammations, asthma, and high blood pressure. The drug is used in Ind ian medicine for skin diseases, syphilis, rheumatism, and leprosy. Centella asiatica is also used for the treatment of mental illness, epilepsy, hysteria, and for dehydration. In Chinese medicine, the herb is used for dysentery and summer diarrhea, vomitin g, asiatica been also used in the treatment of keloids (Hausen et al. 1993). Constituents of Centella asiatica are components of many cosmetic preparations worldwide in th e area of skin care. The leaves of Centella asiatica found application in clinical practice for dermatological disorders and in part icular for improving the healing process of wound, burns, skin and vein ulcers (Randriamampionona et al. 2007). Centella is used in folk medicine also for the treatment of ulcer, tubercolosis (Sa rdar et al. 2015), (Sujarwo et al. 2015), ones (Li et al. 2017), diabetes mellitus (Semenya et al. 2012), malaria (Paul et al. 2013; Shah et al. 2014), intestinal worms (Panm ei et al. 2019), abdominal pain, anorexia (Kadir et al. 2014), headache, depression ( Dey et al. 2017; de Rus Jacquet et al 2 014), gonorrhoea (Das et al. 2013). Centella asiatica has been referred in the French Pharmacopoeia ed. 1884. Despite its long histo ry of traditional use, Centella appeared in the Codex in 1884 and the first dry extract was not created until 1941. Three ye ars after its triterpenoid molecules were isolated by the French scientist, P. Boiteau. The B ritish Pharmacopoeia reports the syste mic use of the aerial part of Centella asiatica in rheumatic condition and the use in cutaneous affections with topical appl ication for indolent wounds, leprous ulcers and cicatrisation after surgery . Accord ing to Medicaments a base de pla ntes, the whole p lant Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 9/68 been used also for sunburns, local and superficial burns, nappy rash, antipruritic local treatment of dermatological di sorders (British Herbal Pharmacopoeia 2003).

The use in leprosy, psoriasis and lupus is not adequatel y documentated by clinical data; in addition, these indications have been excluded by the monograph as they not fulfil the legal requirements for traditional use as defined by art. 16a of the Di rective 2001/83/EC , i.e. indications intended and designed for use without the supervision of a medical practition er for diagnostic purposes or for prescription or monitoring of treatment . There is evidence of traditional use of aerial parts also as anti -rheumatic. However, this indication has been excluded from the monograph, due to the toxic effects of powdered lea ves observed in rats on hepatic and renal function ; in addition, there is enough evidence that Centella asiatica might impair fertility at dos es traditionally used in humans , when taken orally (see section 3). Due to these safety concerns , also the traditi onal use of aerial parts of Centella asiatica administered orally for cutaneous affections , as cited in the British harmacopoeia, cannot be in cluded in the monograph. In conclusion, only the use of aerial parts of Centella asiatica topically applied direct ly as a powder or as an infusion to aid in healing of minor wounds according to the posology reported in the British Pharmacopoeia fulfils the requirements of the Art. 16a of the Directive 2001/83/CE to be included in the monograph. The application on the skin of the herbal infusion has been reported in the monograph as impregnated dressing. This is based on a medicinal product (Madecassol\u00ae) authorised in France since 1976 to aid in the local treatment for granulation phase of wounds, cutaneous ulcers and c utaneous gangrene which is presented as a sterile dressing impregnated with TECA. 3. Non-Clinical Data 3.1. Overview of available pharmacological dat a regarding the herbal substance(s), herbal preparation(s) and relevant constituents thereof In literature there are numerous articles describing the pharmacologic al properties of alcoholic or aqueous extracts of Centella asiatica and its constituents. Assessment report Centella Urb ., activity of Centella asiatica extracts has been investigated basically in the laboratory animal s and it is thought to be due to saponin constituents, including asiaticoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid. The pharmacodynamic effects o f Centella asiatica have been investigated in numerous animal experiments and in vitro studies , including wound h ealing, glycosides (asiaticoside and madecassoside) aglycones (asiatic acid and madecassic acid), are consid ered to be major ingredients with pharmacological activities. 3.1.1. Primary pharmacodynamics Wound healing and collagen -poliferative effects In vitro studies An extract of Centella asiatica was prepared cutting, dryng and grounding into powder. Powdered sample s were extracted with 36% ethanol (ratio 1:6), the extract was filter ed mixed with propylene glycol (80% in water , 40 ml). The extract showed stimulatory effects on collagen synthesis in a dose dependent manner. Collagen was assayed by Sirius red staining method. The vitamin C (25 mg/ml) was used as a positive control and showed 2 -fold collagen enhancing response compared to untreated solvent, which was used as negative control. At 50 mg/mL, the Centella asiatica extract enhanced 3 - fold collagen production compared to the control (untreated), whereas at 30 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL the collagen enhancements were of 2- and 1.4 -fold, respectively. (Hashim et al. 2011) Kim et al. (2011) showed that an ethanolic extract of Centella asiatica represses the process of senescence induced by H 2O2 through the regulation of specific genes involved in DNA replication and mitosis. Human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) were cultured in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 24 h after pre -treatment with Centella asiatica extracts for 4 h and exposure to H 2O2 (200 \u00b5m) for 2 h. H2O2-induced premature senescence decreased by 2 .05% after treatment with Centella asiatica extracts at 2 \u00b5gml and by 20.83% at 20 \u00b5gml. However, post -treatment with Centella asiatica extracts did not change the percentage of senescent cells. Western blotting analysis showed that H 2O2 induced a robust increase in the expression of p53, p21 and pRb and that pre -treatment with Centella asiatica extracts inhibited the accumulation of these proteins. Microa rray analyses showed that the profile of mRNA expression was significantly different between Centella asiatica extract -treated cells and nontreated cells. Specifically, the expression of 39 probes changed more than 2 -fold in Centella asiatica extract -treated cells. Centella asiatica extracts downregulated the expression of genes involved in apoptosis, gen e silencing, cell growth, transcription and s enescence, and up regulated the expression of genes involved in DNA replication and spindle checkpoint. Finally , Centella asiatica extracts rescued the H 2O2-induced repression of in HDFs. An aqueous e xtract of Centella asiatica leaves (obtained extracting dried leaves for 24 h at 100\u00b0C) when encapsulated in nanoparticles using gelatin, efficiently reduc ed the expression of MMP -1 in UV - irradiated human fibroblasts. UVA irradiation significantly induced MMP-1 expression levels up to 136.1%, when compared with the control group (non -UVA). However, this effect was suppressed down to 106.1% and 77.6%, respect ively, by the addition of the unencapsulated crude extracts and nanoparticles at a sample concentrati on of 0.5 mg/ml. At this concentration, the nanoparticles displayed a stronger hyaluronidase inhibition activity (59.5%) than the crude extract (47.1%). Th ese effects were not mediated by gelatin. (Kwon et al. 2012) The effect of an aqueous extract of Centella asiatica on the proliferation and migration of rabbit corneal epithelial (RCE) cells was evaluated by Idrus et al. (2012). Fresh leaves of Centella as iatica were sun - Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 12/68 dried and powdered; 250 g of the powder were refluxed with 1.5 l of distilled water a t ratio 1:6 for 3 h at temperature approximately 40\u00b0C and then cooled, filtered and freeze -dried. RCE cells were cultured with or without supplementation o f Centella asiatica aqueous extract. Viability and proliferation of the RCE was determined by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazole -2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT) assay. In vitro re-epithelization scratch assay and migration rate was ev aluated quantitatively by image analyzer. It was found that supplementation of Centella asiatica did not show any significant effect on the RCE cells proliferation at the concentration up to 500 ppm, while at the concentration of 1000 ppm significantly inh ibited RCE cells proliferation (p < 0.05). However, at the concentration up to 62.5 ppm, RCE cells sh ows significant enhancement of migration rate compared to the control group (p < 0.05). An aqueous solution of Centella asiatica obtained dissolving the d ry powder in phosphate buffer saline was investigated in human dermal fibroblasts by analyzing the in vitro proliferation. For this study, 0 \u00b5g/mL (control), 7.81 \u00b5g/mL, 15.63 \u00b5g/mL, were studied. The proliferati on assay was performed by using MTT with modifications described by Mosmann, 1983. The result displayed an anti -proliferative effect by the Centella asiati ca on the growth of dermal fibroblasts when compared to control (0 g/mL) at high concentrations of Centella asiatica after 4 (500 g/mL and 1000 g/mL) and 8 (250 g/mL, 500 g/mL and 1000 g/mL) days of treatment. In vitro re-epithelization was assessed by scratch assay and migration rate was evaluated quantitatively by image analyzer. Centella asiatica aqueous solution inhibits the migration of dermal fibroblasts at the concentration of 194.15 g/mL, when compared to the control (0 g/mL). Gene expression of type I collagen, type III collagen, fibronectin and alpha -smoo th muscle actin 2 ( SMAA2) were stu died via real-time RT -PCR. The gene expression decreased with increasing concentration of aqueous extract of Centella asiatica up to 194.15 g/mL, although it was not statistically significant compared to control (0 g/mL) . Finally, supplementation of aque ous solutions of Centella asiatica did not alter the cell cycle even at 194.15 g/mL. (Idrus et al. 2018) In vivo studies Alcoholic Centella extracts when topically applied accelerate wound healing stimulating epithelis ation and increasing the rate of w ound contraction. Reduction in granuloma weight and increase in the force needed to cause rupture of the wound (rupture strength) were also observed. These effects are associated to the increased granulation tissue levels of DNA, protein and total collagen (Suguna et al. 1996). Another study describes the effects of oral and topical administration of an alcoholic extract of the leaves of Centella asiatica on rat dermal wound healing. Leaves of Centella asiatica obtained lo cally were minced and powdered in absolute ethanol (1ml/g) and the homogenate was filtered through a cotton gauze. The crude extract (1 ml) was applied topically or given orally once daily for 24 days. The extract increased cellular proliferation and colla gen synthesis at the wound site, a s evidenced by an increase in DNA, protein and collagen content of granulation tissues. Quicker and better maturation and cross linking of collagen was observed in the extract -treated rats. The extract treated wounds were found to reepithelialise faster an d the rate of wound contraction was higher, as compared to control wounds (Suguna et al. 1996). The wound healing activities of sequential hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol, and aqueous extracts of incis ion and partial -thickness burn wou nd models have been investigated in rats. Collected aerial parts of Centella asiatica were oven -dried at 50\u00b0C and then powdered using a milling machine. The powdered plant (1 kg) was macerated with n -hexane (3 \u00d7 4 L, 3 day s each) at room temperature. The p ooled filtrates were dried under reduced pressure to give the n -hexane extract (HexE) at a constant weight of 17.8 g . The marc was air -dried before it was further macerated with Assessment report on asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 13/68 ethyl acetate and methanol, respectively, us ing the procedure described above to give the ethyl acetate (32.7 g) and methanol (267.5 g) extracts. Subsequently, a portion (300 g) of the dried marc was boiled in distilled water (2 L) for 3 h, then filtered and dried to give 95.1 g of the hot aqueous extract . Tween 20W as a 10% solutio n in distilled water was used as vehicle for preparation of a 10% (w/v) of each extract for topical application (0.5 ml of the test substances was topically applied to the burnt area once daily). The general appearance and degree of wound healing of the bu rn wound were assessed on Days 3, 7, 10 and 14 after burn injury and prior to histopathological evaluation. The degrees of healing in the burn wound with the four extracts were significantly higher than that of the control on Days 3, 10 and 14. Histopathol ogical findings on Day 14 after burn injury revealed prominent fibrinoid necrosis and incomplete epithelialization in the control and untreated groups, whereas fully developed epithelialization and keratinization were obse rved in all extract -treated groups (Somboonwong et al. 2012) . The efficacy of a topical spray containing methanolic extract of Centella asiatica herb has been evaluated on excision wounds in rats. Hydroxypropyl -b-cyclodextrin, Eudragit E100, glycerol, PEG 400, copovidone, ethanol and purif ied water were included in the formulation. Air -dried aerial parts of Centella asiatica were cut into tiny pieces, powdered and sieved . The powder was defatted with petroleum ether and extracted with methanol in a Soxhelet apparatus for 12 h. The extract w as concentrated over a water bath (50 \u00b0C) and dried at 50 \u00b0C (\u00b1 5 \u00b0C) in a hot air oven under atmospheric conditions. Final traces of methanol were removed under reduced pressure (~8 mbar) at 55 \u00b0C using a rotary evaporato r. The assay content of triterpene s in the extract was 0.12 % asiatic acid, 0.54 % madecassic acid, 0.25 % asiaticoside and 1.02 % madecassoside. The animals were assigned into 3 groups ( n= 6 in each group). Group 1 was untreated and was regarded as the co ntrol. Group 2 animals received p ovidone iodine solution (Betadine\u00ae) treatment, while group 3 animals received the Centella asiatica extract 5 puffs (~2.5 mL) of topical spray once daily for 14 days starting from the first day of wounding. There was signif icant wound healing in group 3 tr eated with Centella asiatica extract compared to the control group (group 1). However, group 2 involving conventional wound treatment with povidone iodine solution showed the highest wound healing activity due to its antimi crobial activity (Sawatdee et al. 2016). In another study, the potential of electrospun gelatin membranes containing methanolic Centella asiatica vivo using Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Thirty -five grams of Centella asi atica slices was extracted using 700 ml of 90% methanol under stirring for 5 h. The supernatant from the methanol extraction was directly filtered, evaporated and lyophilized to obtain dry extract (~10 g). The Centella asia tica extract was dissolved in 90% methanol, adjusted to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml, and filtered through a 0.45 -m filter membrane. The wound areas of rat skin treated with EGC presented the highest recovery rate compared with those treated with gauze, neat gelatin membranes and co mmercial wound dressings (Comfeel\u00ae, Peterborough, United Kin gdom). The results of the histopathological examination support the outcome of the wound models (Yao et al. 2017) . Pure constituents of Centella asiatica In vitro studies Asiaticoside has been sh own to induce type I collagen synthesis in human dermal fibroblast cells. However, the mechanism underlying asiaticoside -induced type I collagen synthesis, especially at a molecular level, remains only partially understood. The conclusions of a study condu cted on cultured human dermal fibroblast cells suggest that asiaticoside can induce ty pe I collagen synthesis via the activation of the TGF receptor 1 (TR1) kinase -independent Smad pathway (Lee et al. 2006). The application of asiaticoside at low doses o f 108 to 1012 % (w/w) facilitated burn wound repair. To clarify the accelerating mec hanisms of asiaticoside on burn wound repair, the effects of asiaticoside on Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 14/68 the levels of various cytokines produced at the site of the burn wound was examined. The topi cal application of a low dose (10 pg, 1 ng, or 100 ng/wound area) of -1 levels in burn wound exudates. Asiaticoside (10 pg t o 100 ng/ml) enhanced MCP -1 production in human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT cells, but it had no direct effect on VEGF production. Furthermore, asiaticoside (10 pg to 100 ng/ml) increased the IL -1 production in THP -1 macrophages with MCP -1, but it had no effect on IL -1 production without MCP -1 or with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Findings suggest that the enhancement of burn wound healing by asiaticoside might be due to the promotion of angiogenesis duri ng skin wound repair as a result of the stimulation of VEGF production caused by the increase in MCP -1 expression in keratinocytes and the increase in IL -1 expression in macrophages induced cooperatively by asiaticoside plus MCP -1 (Kimura et al. 2008). In order to investigate the effects of asiatic acid on c ell proliferation, invasion and collagen synthesis, normal and keloid fibroblasts isolated from human skin were exposed to TGF -1 with or without Asiatic acid. Keloid fibroblasts had a higher baseline l evel and responded more briskly to TGF -1 stimulation in collagen type I expression, compared to normal fibroblasts. Asiatic acid (10 and 30 M) significantly decreased TGF -1-induced collagen type I expression in keloid fibroblasts, while had little effec t on normal fibroblasts as determined by ELISA. This e ffect seemed to be mediated by peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor - (PPAR-) activation. (Bian et al. 2013) Higher expression of growth differentiation factor -9 (GDF -9) in keloids compared with hypertrophic scars and normal skin tissues has been r eported. Wu et al. (2017) showed that GDF -9 could enhance the proliferation, migration, and invasion of keloid fibroblasts (KFs), while it only slightly elevated collagen expression, indicating that the effect of GDF -9 was opposite to that of TGF -1. The a uthors also demonstrated that asiaticoside (10 and 30 \u00b5M) markedly inhibited cell proliferation induced by GDF-9 stimulation and decreased the invasive capacity of KFs in a concentration -dependent manner. Lee et al. (2012) investigated the effect s of asia ticoside at concentrations of 0, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 \u00b5M on normal human skin cells (adult human dermal fibroblasts and adult normal human epidermal keratinocytes) in a wound closure seeding model. Compared with a control group, asiaticos ide-treated cells migrated faster, and the most effective concentration varied with cell type. In fibroblasts, asiaticoside at 250 \u00b5M increased migration rate most effectively and improved wound healing by approximately 20% compared with a control group. I n keratin ocytes, 500 \u00b5M asiaticoside improved wound healing by about 20%. By a MTT assay, the authors demonstrated that asiaticoside treatment significantly enhanced the initial skin cell adhesion (the numbers of fibroblasts attached increased by approxima tely 40% and the numbers of keratinocytes, by more than 10%). Finally, asiaticoside promoted the growth of fibroblasts in a dose -dependent manner. At 62.5 \u00b5M asiaticoside, the cell number did not increase significantly compared with a control DMSO until th e 5- day assessment; however, at 125 \u00b5M and higher concentrations of asiaticoside the numbers of treated cells increased steadily from 1 to 5 days compared with the control group. In contrast, asiaticoside did not influence the growth rate of keratinocytes . The eff ects of asiaticoside on proliferation, protein synthesis, and osteogenic differentiation in human periodontal ligament cells (HPDLs) at concentrations of 25, 50, and 100 \u00b5g/mL. This compound had no effect on cytotoxicity or cell proliferation as d etermined by MTT assay. When HPDLs were treated with asiaticoside in serum -free medium, dose -dependent increases in the levels of fibronectin and collagen type I mRNA and protein were observed at 72 h. The increase of fibronectine levels was statistically significa nt only with highest concentration of asiaticoside (100 \u00b5g/mL), whilst the effect on collagen I protein expression was significant already at 50 \u00b5g/mL A significant reduction of MMP -1 mRNA expression was noted at the highest concentration of asiat icoside ( 100 mg/mL) whereas a of metalloproteinase -1 (TIMP -1) mRNA expression was observed at lower concentrations (25 and 50 mg/mL) as well. Finally, the addition of asiaticoside to osteogenic medium Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 enzymatic activity, up -regulation of osteoblast marker expression, and enhancement of mineralization by HPDLs. (Nowwarote et al. 2013) The effect of asiaticoside (0, 100, 250, and 500 mg/L) on the proliferation a nd collag en expression was investigated on fibroblasts isolated from keloid tissue and normal skin tissue s. After 3 days of treatment, asiaticoside significantly diminished keloid fibroblast proliferation by 28, 30, and 51%, at 100, 250, and 500 mg/L, resp ectively (p < 0.05). On day 5, the reduction of proliferation after asiaticoside treatment was 35, 48, and 63%, at 100, 250, and 500 mg/L, respectively. However, the normal fibroblasts' viability was not significantly decreased by asiaticoside as assayed b y MTT. Th e effects of asiaticoside on the expression of type I and type III collagen in normal and keloid fibroblasts were investigated using RT -PCR analyses and Western blotting. Asiaticoside (100, 250, and 500 mg/L) did not affect the expression of colla gen prote in and mRNA in normal fibroblasts. Pre -treatment of keloid fibroblasts with asiaticoside (100, 250, and 500 mg/L) significantly reduced the mRNA levels of type I and type III collagen production (p < 0.05). Moreover, Western blotting showed that t ype I and type III collagen protein expressions were correlated with their mRNA levels, demonstrating that asiaticoside decreased the expression of collagen. In addition, asiaticoside reduced the expression of both TGF -RI and TGF -RII at the transcription al and tr anslational level. Moreover, it increased the expression of Smad7 protein and mRNA. (Tang et al. 2011) Song et al. (2011) evaluated of madecassoside on the proliferation and apoptosis of keloid KFs, originating from huma n earlobe keloids, were purified and cultured, and the treated with increasing concentrations of madecassoside (10, 30, and 100 mM) for 48h -96h. MTT assay showed that a significant inhibition of madecassoside against the proliferation of KFs occurred at days 3 and 4. At day 4, the inhibitory percentages of madecassoside (10, 30, and 100 mM) were up to 23.4, 36.2, and 45.2%, respectively. The induction of apoptosis was investigated by Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry analysis. In KFs treated with ma decassosi de (10, 30, and 100 mM) for 48 h, cell nuclei were stained much brighter than control cells. Nuclear shrinkage, condensed chromatin, and fragmented nuclei were also frequently seen in treated cells. Flow ciytometry analysis confirmed that treatmen t with ma decassoside for 48 h resulted in a concentration -dependent increase of apoptosis in KFs. In detail, the apoptosis percentages in madecassoside (10, 30, and 100 mM) -treated groups were 9.3, 16.7, and 24.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the authors sh owed that madecassoside activated caspase -9 and caspase -3 rather than caspase -8, depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential, and regulated expression of B -cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl -2) family members in KFs. The same group of authors treated keloid fib roblasts originating from human earlobe keloids with increasing concentrations of madecassoside (10, 30, and 100 mM) for 24h to study the potential on the migration by transwell migration assays assay at 24 h. The inhibitory percentages of madecassoside (30 and 100 mM) as determined by transmembrane assay were up to 52.3% and 71.5%. (Song et al. 2012) In vivo studies The activity of asiaticoside, saponin comp onent iso lated from Centella asiatica, was studied in normal as well as delayed -type wound healing. In guinea pig punch wounds topical applications of 0.2% solution of asiaticoside produced 56% increase in hydroxyproline, 57% increase in tensile strength, increased collagen content and better epithelisation. In streptozotocin diabetic rats, where healing is delayed, topical application of 0.4% solution of asiaticoside over punch wounds increased hydroxyproline content, tensile strength, collagen content and epitheli sation thereby facilitating the healing. Asiaticoside was active by the oral route also at 1 mg/kg dose in the guinea pig punch wound model. It promoted angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane model at 40 mg/disk concentration (Shukla et al. 1999). Assessment report on Centel la asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page triterpene constitu ents of Centella asiatica were investigated by an in vivo burn injury model using male ICR mice ( n = 120; 18-22 g). Back hair was removed and back skin was burnt by direct contact for 9 seconds with a br ass rod (65 g, 1 cm in diameter) heated to 95 \u00b0C. Equal molar of four triterpene compounds were dissolved in distill water, and administered orally (6, 12, 24 mg/kg for asiaticoside and madecassoside; 3, 6, 12 mg/kg for asiatic acid and madecassic acid) for 14 consecutive days. Control group ( n = 24) was handled in the same way except for administering distilled water. Wound was photographed, and the areas were measured on days 0, 3, 7, 11, 14 by using Image J. At the same time points, the total wou nds were biopsied and fixed in 10% formalin for further analysis. Both asiaticoside and madecassoside not only accelerated wound healing, but also result ed in a better wound healing pattern in a view of histological examination. Madecassoside (24 mg/kg) -treated gro up showed significantly better wound healing speed and wound healing results as compared with asiaticoside (24 mg/kg) -treated group ( P = 0.0057 and P = 0.0491, correspondingly). The effects on cell proliferation, collagen synthesis, matrix metallo proteinas e-1 (MMP-1)/ tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase -1 (TGF-)/Sma- and Mad-related protein ( Smad ) signaling pathway were investigated in vitro using primary human skin fibroblasts, originating from healthy human foreskin samples. All test compounds at concentrations of 1, 3, 10 M could not enhance cell pro liferation, as compared with control group. Both asiaticoside and madecassoside (3, 10 M) significantly elevated mRNA levels of collagen type I and type III in fibroblasts as determined by RT -PCR, as well as protein levels of procollagen type I and type I II as detected by ELISA. In contrast, neither asiatic acid nor madecassic acid could influence collagen synthesis in fibroblasts as compared with control. Furthermore, madecassoside was more effective than asiaticoside at 10 M (P = 0.0446). Although madec assoside (3 M) could significantly enhanced TIMP-1 mRNA expression, the four compounds failed to aff ect MMP -1/TIMP -1 ratio in human skin fibroblasts as d etermined by RT-PCR. Both asiaticoside (10 M) and madecassoside (3, 10 M) significantly increased TG F-1 and TGF beta type II receptor ( decreasing 7 mRNA phosphorylation levels of Smad 3 in fibroblast s, while they had no influence on T RI expression. In contrast, neither asiatic acid nor madecassic ac id could influence TGF-/Smad pathway in fibroblasts as compared with control. Madecassoside was more effective than asiaticoside at 10 M (P = 0.0487), w hich was consistent with above results on collagen synthesis. (Wu et al. 2012) In another study aimed to investigate the potentiality of ultradeformable vesicles as a possible topical delivery system for asiaticoside, 192 Male SD rats weighing 300 - 350 g w ere topically treated on the dorsal skin using non -occlusive patches. The rats were divided i nto four groups and treated twice daily: the first group was treated with free asiaticoside, the second was treated with asiaticoside -loaded ultradeformable vesicl es at a sodium cholate molar fraction of 0.2, the third group was pre -treated (1 h) with ultradeformab le vesicles and then with asiaticoside and the fourth group was left untreated. After 7, 14, and 28 days of treatment the animals were sacrifi ced, 8 -mm skin punches were collected and the degree of collagen biosynthesis was determined . Ultradeformable vesi cle-entrapped asiaticoside was able to increase the amount of collagen after just 7 days of treatment (~22%), while the other treatments were not able to significantly increase the biosynthesis of collagen. After 28 days of treatment ultradeformable vesicl e-entrapped asiaticoside was able to double the amount of collagen biosynthesis (~105%) compared to untreated animals. (Paolino et al. 2012) The therapeut ic effects of asiaticoside -microspheres on wound healing and skin appendages regeneration were investi gated. Asiaticoside was dissolved in small volume of ethanol and then added to the internal phase (20 ml of dichloromethane containing drug and ethyl cell ulose); this preparation was dropped into 60 ml distilled water containing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) in various concentrations as the emulsifying agent. The mixture of internal and external phases was stirred for 8 h at 25 \u00b0C to evaporate the dichloromethane. The wound healing properties of a free asiaticoside solution and of asiaticoside -based microsphere wa s evaluated in SD rats. Full thickness skin excision wounds (1.5 cm) Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 17/68 were made on the rats. The rats with wounds were then divided into four groups random ly, including (1) blank control group in which no treatment was provided; (2) blank microspheres group , no drug was loaded in microspheres; (3) asiaticoside solution group; and (4) asiaticoside -loaded microsphere s group, with six in each group . Treatments were topically delivered to the wound site once every two days. The dose of asiaticoside in the asiati coside microsphere and asiaticoside solution groups was 0.5 mg/each time. The gloss appearance images of the wound sites in the various groups were examin ated on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 20. All of the wounds expressed the gradual healing throughout the exper imental period. Accurate wound closure rates of the skin excision were determined from the percentage of wound surface covered by regenerating epidermis. Compared with the blank control group, both the asiaticoside solution and asiaticoside -microsphere exp ressed a trend to accelerate the wound closure within the tested 20 days. However, only the acceleration rates at day 7 and day 14, expressed by the asiat icoside -microsphere treatment were significant. Scar was one of the most common complications of wound healing. In contrast to those of blank control and vehicle control groups, the scars in the asiaticoside solution and asiaticoside loaded microsphere tre ated groups appeared small or less within the tested period. On the days 14 and 20, the healed skins o f the asiaticoside -microsphere treated group, appeared smooth without scar appearance. The healed skins were analyzed with hematoxylin and eosin staining for histological analysis. The wounds in the blank control and blank microsphere groups had wide areas of dense dermis with the characteristics of scars. In the asiaticoside solution treated group, small skin appendage follicles could be observed. However, in the asiaticoside -microsphere group, obvious skin appendages and similar structure to those of norm al skin were shown in the regenerated skin sections. The Masson's trichrome staining on the newly formed skin tissues at day 20 post -wounding revealed tha t, the amount of collagenous fibers in drug group and drug loaded microsphere groups slightly was incr eased compared with those of blank control and blank microsphere treated groups. A pro -angiogenic effect could be detected in both asiaticoside solution t reated group and in the asiaticoside -microsphere group based on CD31 immunohistochemical staining (Zhang et al. 2016) The wound an asiaticoside -rich polyvinyl alcohol/polyethylene glycol (PVA/PEG) hydrogel has been evaluated in rabbits using an incision model. This fraction was obtained subjecting an ethanolic extract of aerial parts of Centella asiatica to Vacuum Liquid Chromatographic procedure. The wounds were divided into four groups in six rabbits as follows: Group 1: treated with a siaticoside - rich hydrogel, Group 2: treated with Madecassol cream (Bayer) (positive control), Group 3: treated with blank hydrogel, Group 4: no treatment (negative control). The wounds were treated once daily for 12 days. The hydrogel formulation did not c ause any signs of irritation on the rabbits' skin and enhanced wound healing 15% faster than the comme rcial cream and > 40% faster than the untreated wounds. The skin healing process was seen in all wounds marked by formation of a thick epithelial layer, k eratin, and moderate formation of granulation tissues, fibroblasts and collagen with no fibrinoid necrosis detected.

Secondary pharmacodynamics Due to the l arge amount of in vitro and in vivo studies investigating the pharmacological effec ts of Centella asiatica on a wide spectrum of physiological functions, mainly as water or alcoholic extracts, this sections focuses only on studies carried out with water ex tracts or powdered herb which are considerd more relevant taking ino account the he rbal preparation s reported in the monograph. Antinociceptive and anti -inflammatory effects The potential of Centella asiatica as an anti -inflammatory agent was evaluated on fibroblast cells incubated for 24 h with 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol -13-acetate (TPA) and methanolic, ethanolic and aqueous extracts prepared from 50 g of coarsed plant powder and with asiaticoside and Assessment report on asiatica (L.) Urb EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 20/68 madecassoside. Treatments with 30 g/ml concentration of each extract on the TPA -induced fibroblast cells produced significantly less PGE2 c ompared to control (TPA alone). Ethanol and methanol extracts of CA were more potent than aqueous extract. In addition, at 30 g/ml, the ethanol, methanol and aqueous extrac ts inhibited COX -1 and COX and 97.91%, 98.18% and 96.16%, 83.06% and 72.10%, respectively. Aspirin was used as positive control at 5 mg/ml concentration and inhibited COX -1 and COX -2 by 80. 98% and 88.86%, respectively. (Nurlaily et al. 2012) The whole plant water extract of Centella asiatica (10, 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg) revealed signi ficant antinociceptive activity using acetic acid -induced writhing and hot -plate method in mice. The activity was statistically similar to aspirin but less p otent than morphine. The Centella asiatica extract also revealed significant anti -inflammatory activity in rats by prostaglandin E 2-induced paw oedema . This effect was statistically similar to the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, mefenamic acid (Somchi t et al. 2004). The anti -inflammatory effects of dried, powdered water and ethanolic extracts from whole plant of Centella asiatica were i nvestigated in male albino rats by paw oedema. The ethanolic extract at a dose of 200mg/kg bw /oral possessed anti -inflammatory activity, comparable to the Ib uprofen at a dose of 100mg/kg bw /oral (% oedema 71.18% and 66.66%, respectively; mean oedema volume after 3 h was 0.212\u00b10.023 ml, res pectively). The aqueous extract at a dose of 200 mg/kg bw /oral showed a lower effect (%inhibition of edema after 3 h was 46.31% and mean oedema volume after 3 h was 0.192\u00b10.024 ml), although superior to the control (1% sodium carboxy methyl cellulose suspe nsion). (George et al. 2009) Effects on vascula r function The cardiovascular effects of a single oral administration of lyophilized powder of Centella asiatica (CA) leave juice at doses 16, 24 and 32 g of fresh leaves/kg (equivalent to 0.26, 0.38 and 0.52 g of lyophilized powder/kg) on blood pressure (BP), heart rate and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were investigated in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) -salt (1 g/kg bw) hypertensive male Wistar rats. CA leave juice had BP lowering and slight negati ve chronotropic effect in DOCA -salt hypertensiv e group, but not in normal. Prior administration of CA leave juice, the rCBF level of DOCA -salt hypertensive group was significantly low, compared to that of the normal. After CA leave juice administration at the dose of 32 g/Kg bw, rCBF increased signifi cantly at 5 -90 min in normal and DOCA -salt hypertensive grou ps, respectively. The increased rCBF was accompanied with significant decreased BP at 15 to 120 min only in DOCA -salt hypertensive group . The maximum decrease of systolic and dyas tolic BP were 13.86 % and 14.10 % at 60 minutes. (Thirawa rapan et al. 2019) Anti-pruritic activity In vivo studies The anti pruritic activity of aqueous and alcoholic extracts of Centella asiatica was evaluated b y examining the incidence of scratching in alb ino rats of either sex weighing between 120 -150 g. Powdered dried plant (20 g) was macerated with 500 ml of water or ethanol for 4 days; then, the solvent was evaporated from the filtrate to get the dried extra ct. Rats were divided into four groups. Group I :Control, received only vehicle(2% gum acacia solution, 2 ml / Kg p.o) Group II : Treated with Chlorpheniramine maleate ( 1 mg/Kg p.o) Group III and Group IV: Treated with aqueous/ethanolic extract of C. asia tica (100 and 100mg/Kg p.o). The incidence of scratching was significantly lower for Groups II, III and IV compared to control group (George et al. 2009) Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 21/68 Immuno -modulatory effects A study focused on the influence of whole fresh Centella asiatica extract o n cell -mediated and humoral immune responses w as carried out. Centella asiatica water extract significantly increased proliferation and the production of IL -2 and TNF - in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In contrast, an ethanol extract of Centella asiatica inhibited human PBMC mitoge nesis and the production and TNF mice treated with Centella asiatica extracts (100 mg/kg bw) showed higher responses to both primary and secondary antibodies against BSA when compared with non-treated group. The study shows immuno -modulat ing activity of Centella asiatica extracts with regard to both non-specific cellular and humoral immune responses (Punturee et al. 2005). Anti-oxidant activity The antioxida nt activity of various extracts from differen t parts of Centella asiatica (roots, leaves, stolons) was evaluated usi ng a lin oleic acid model system and the thiobarbituric acid test. Ten grams of each freeze -dried part of Centella asiatica were extracted with three different solvents (ethanol, water and light petroleum). The ethanol extract (best activity at pH 7 and sta bility up to 50\u00b0C) of all parts of Centella asiatica exhibited significantly ( P<0.05) higher antioxidative activity than the water extract, while the light petroleum ether showed neglig ible activity. Increasing the concent ration of the extract (1000 -3000 p pm) result ed in increase in antioxidative activity of both the ethanol and the water extract. From 3000 ppm upward , antioxidative activity of the ethanol extract was not significantly different ( P<0.05) from that of -tocopherol. Roots showed the highest activity of the parts tested. (Abdul Hamid et al. 2002). An aqueous extract of Centella asiatica (50 g/L), obtained by infusion followed by cold maceration for 24 h, showed elevated DPPH scavenging activity, with an I C50 value of 31.25 g/mL. Ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) produced IC 50 values of 2.50 g/ mL and 7.58 g/mL, respectively (Pittella et al. 2009). Anand et al. (2010) assessed the antioxidant potential in vitro of extracts of Centella asiat ica. Extracts were prepared from fifty grams of crushed leaf by sequential extraction of Centella asiatica from non polar to polar solvents viz., hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol and water. Determination of antioxidant activity was base d on D PPH radical scanvenging activity and Hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (TBARS). Methanol extract was observed with highest of the DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging with IC 50 values of 0.07 mg/ml and 500 \u00b5g/ml respectively, while hexane fraction is least potent. (Anand et al, 2010) An ethanolic extract of Centella asiatica was assayed for -1-picrylhydrazyl (84%) was compa to grape seed extract (83%) and Vitamin C (88%), used as positive controls. (Hashim et al. 2011) The antioxidant poten tial of a water extract of Centella asiatica (4-64 \u00b5g/ml) was assessed by its free radical scavenging activity such as DPPH as well a s 2, bis hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide radical scavenging activities were determined. Ascorbic acid and trolox were utilized as a standard. The dried plant powder (100 g) was dissolved in 1000 mL of distilled water for 72 h with occasional shaking. The extract was further filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper and the filtrate was concentrated using a bench top lyophilizer under re duced pressure. At a concentration of 64 \u00b5g/mL, the IC 50 values of water extracts of Centella asiatica , trolox, and ascorbic from the ABTS+ radical scavengi ng ability was found to be high in Centella asiatica (IC50 = 27.21 \u00b5g/mL) followed by ascorbic herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Centella asiatica, ascorbic acid and trolox at the concentration of 64 \u00b5g/mL were 69.96 \u00b1 1.07, and The IC 50 values of Centella asiatica, ascorbic acid and trolox found to 7.6 \u00b1 2.51, and 13.43 \u00b1 respectively. Finally, the water extract of Centella asiatica showed the highest inhibitory effect with the IC 50 value of 28.15 \u00b1 2.01 \u00b5g/mL at the concentration of 64 \u00b5g/mL. In contrast, trolox and ascorbic acid showed the inhibitory effect with the IC 50 value 18.53 \u00b1 1.7, and 21.93 \u00b1 3.2 \u00b5 g/mL, respectively (Kuma ri et al. 2016) The cardio protective effect of Centella asiatica on myocardial marker enzymes and antioxidant enzymes in adriamycin induced cardiomyopathy was invest igated in rats. The whole plant was shade dried and coarsely ground with grinder. The coars e powder of plant was extracted with 8 parts of distilled water under boiling for 5 hrs and was filtered thro ugh a 400 -mesh cloth to collect the extract. The extract was concentrated and freeze dried. Pre- and co -treatment with Centella asiatica (200 mg/kg bw/oral) extract significantly of serum marker (LDH, CPK, GOT and GPT) enzymes and of the antioxidan t enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx, GST) activities induced by adriamycin (2.5 mg/kg bw, i.p.), restoring them to near normal levels (Gnan aprag asam et al. 2004). A study was designed to determine whether extract of Centella asiatica would prevent age -related changes in in rat. The whole plant was cleaned, air -dried and powdered. The powder was soaked in double distilled water, ethanol in sha king incubator at 25 \u00b11\u00b0C (1:1) for 2 days. Oral s upplementation of Centella asiatica (300 mg/kg bw/day) for 60 days to aged rats, reduced brain regional lipid peroxidation ( LPO) and protein carbonyl ( PCO) levels and increased the antioxidant status. (Subat hra et al. 2005). In a further study, H2O2-treated male SD rats were randomly divided into six groups of four rats and treated f or 6 weeks as follows: (1) normal diet; (2) normal diet + 0.03% (v/v) H 2O2; (3) 5.0% (w/w) (v/v) H 2O2. However, there were no signifi cant differences in dietary intake and histopatholog y observations of the organs of the rats. (Mahanom et al. 2011) Neuroprotective effects , including effects on cognitive function The fresh leaf extract of Centella asiatica was given to adult mice at 2, 4, and 6 mL/kg doses during 2, 4, and 6 weeks, respectively. After these periods, th e rem oved brains of mice were investigated under microscope, which pointed out to the evidence that the extract given at 6 mL/kg dose during 6 weeks caused a significant augment in dendritic arborization in neurons (Gadahad et al., 2008). The powdered leaf of Centella asiatica given intragastrically to male Wistar rats at a dosage of 2mg / 0.5 ml of distilled water/day (12mg/kg bw) for 10 days, only enhanced retention of memory but did not improve the learning process (Jared, 2010). Amyloid beta (A) is the major pathological and etiological factor implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). A(42) inherently self assembles to form oligomers and fibrils which may lead to neuronal dysfunction. Dried leaves (40 g) of Centella asiatica were extracted with distilled water by steam extractor, then filtered and lyophilized to get dry powder. The anti -amyloidogenic property of this aqueous extract of Centella asiatica (100 \u00b5g) was examined using both thioflavin -T test and transmission electron microscope; however, it wa s observed not to cause any inhibition on aggregation of the monomers and oligomers. (Ramesh et al. 2010) In SH -SY5Y neuroblastoma cells treated with exogenous A as well as in MC65 neuroblastoma cells that overexpress amyloid precursor protein that an aqueous extract of Centella asiatica at 100 \u00b5g/ml Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 23/68 can reverse the increase in reactive oxygen species observed in response to A . The extract was prepared by reflux ing Centella asiatica (60g) with water (750mL) for 2 hours, filtering the solution and freeze drying to yield a powder (~6 - 8g). (Gray et al. 2015) The same group of authors, carried out an ex-vivo study, using cultures of primary hippocampal neurons isola ted from embryonic Tg2576 mice and their WT littermates. Isolated neurons were treated with a Centel la asiatica water extract ( CAW) at a concentration of 50ug/mL for 7 days. CAW was prepared by refluxing Centella asiatica (160g) with water (2 L) for 2 hour s, filtering the solution and freeze drying to yield a powder (~16 -21g). The Tg2576 line expresses t he human APPswe double mutation (K670N -M671L), resulting in an accumulation of A1 -42 in the brain and the development of agedependent A plaques. CAW enhan ced arborization and spine densities in WT neurons and prevented the diminished outgrowth of dendrit es and loss of spines caused by A exposure in Tg2576 neurons (Gray et al. 2017) Different doses of aqueous extract (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg) of the whole pl ant of Centella asiatica have been shown to counter -attack the effect of oxidative stress by decreas ing the lipid peroxidation and increasing the endogenous antioxidant enzymes in brain. Coarse powder of the plant was extracted with eight parts of water un der boiling for 5 ho urs and filtered to collect the extract. The extract was concentrated and finall y dried to powder. The aqueous extract of whole plant (200 mg/kg for 14 days) showe d an improvement in learning and memory of male Wistar rats in both shutt le box and step through paradigms. All doses of aqueous extract increased the number of avoidances i n shuttle box and prolon ged the step through latency in step through apparatus in a dose dependent manner. Only two dose s (200 and 300 mg/kg of aqueous extract) showed significant increase in the step down latency in step down apparatus and transfer latenc y in elevated plus maze. Aqueous extract at 200 and 300 mg/kg showed a significant decrease in the brain levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) with simultaneous s ignificant increase in levels of glutathione. There wa s a significant increase in the levels of cata lase at the 300 mg/kg but no significant change in su peroxide dismutase (SOD) levels was observed. (Veerendra Kumar & Gupta 2002). The effect of the same aqueous extract of Centella asiatica (100 and 300 mg/kg) as reported above was evaluated on the course of kindling development, kindling -induced learni ng deficit and oxidative stress markers in kindled rats. The administration of Centella asiatica aqueous extract (300 mg/kg or ally) decreased the PTZ -kindled seizures and showed impr ovement in the learning deficit induced by PTZ kindling as eviden ced by decreased seizure score and increased latencies in passive avoidance behaviour. Howe ver, low dose of the Centella asiatica aqueous extract (100 mg/kg) showed improvement o nly in the le arning deficit due to the kindling and failed to improve the seizure score. (Gupta et al. 2003). Swiss albino mice were injected orally with water (weight t o volume ratio of 1:3) whole plant Centella asiatica extract 200 mg/kg for 15 days from day 15 to da y 30 post partum (p.p.) and the nootro pic effect was evaluated on day 31 and 6 months p.p. Performance of juvenile and young adult mice was significantly im proved in radial arm maze and hole board tests. Treatment resulted in increased acetylcholine estera se activity in the hippocampus. Dendritic arborisation of hippocampal CA3 neurons was also increased in terms of intersections and branching points, both at one month and 6 months. (Rao et al. 2005). The effects of a water extract of Centella asiatica in the Tg2576 mouse, a murine model of AD with high -amyloid burden were investigated. The dried water extract was prepared by refluxing Centella asiatica (120g) with water (1.5L) for 2hr, filtering to remove plant debris and freeze -drying to yield a residue (11.5g). A dose of 200 mg/kg of extract was administered for 2 weeks. Open -field behavior and Morris water maze testing were performed at the end of this pe riod. Orally administered Centella Assessment report behavioral abnormalities in these mice. (Soumyanath et al. 2012) A standardised (no further detail provided) aqueous extract of Centella asiatica orally administered to male Wistar rats at doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg for a period of six weeks improved memory performa nce compared to aluminum chloride treated rats (100 mg/kg). Chronic Centella asiatica (150 and 300 mg/kg) administration significantly attenuated oxidative damage as compared to aluminum chloride treated rats; higher dose of Centella asiatica (300 mg/kg) s ignificantly reversed the decreased activity of mitochondrial enzymes as compared to aluminum -treated rat. Finally, chronic Centella asiatica (150 and 300 mg/kg) treatment significantly attenuated AChE and caspase -3 activity in hippocampus and cortex compa red to control rats (aluminum chloride treated group). (Prakash & Kumar, 2013) Giribabu et al. (2014) investigated the protective role of Centella asiatica on the hippocampus in diabetes. An aqueous extract was prepared by so aking 1 kg of powdered dried le aves in 3 L of distilled water for 48 hrs. Th e extracted material was then fitered three or four times until the extract was rendered colorless. Th e extract was distilled and concentrated under reduced pressure in rotary evaporator at 50 \u00b1 5\u00b0C and lyophili zed using freeze -dryer. Streptozocin bw Centella asiatica leaf aqueous extract for four extracts 100 200 mg/kg/day bw or the hippocampal homogenates as compared to non -treated diabetic rats, and resulted in significantly higher SOD ( p<0.01), CAT (p<0.05) hippocampus as compar ed to nontreated diabetic rats. In addition, administration of Centella asiatica leaf aqueous extract to diabetic rats maintained near normal ATPases activity levels. Lesser signs of histopathological changes were observed in the hippocampus of Centella asiatica leaf aqueous extract treated dia betic rats. (Giribabu et al. 2014). Mitha et al. (2016) studied the effect of Centella a siatica (CA) on cognitive impairment in offspring of alcoholic rats. Pregnant rats (n=6) in alcoholic group were orally fed with 30% alcohol at a dose of 5 g/kg body we ight during their gestation period. Pregnant rats in control group (n=6) were given water. Offspring from alcoholic group were divided into treated group and untreated group (n=8 each group). Offspring in treated grou p were orally given whole plant aqueous extract of CA at a dose of 20 ml/kg bw. Treatment with CA increases the learning capacity, spatial memory, memory retention and decreases the anxiety like behavior as determined by Morris Water Maze, Passive avoidanc e test, Elevated Plus Maze. The cogniti ve enhancing effects of a water extract of Centella asiatica (CAW) were determined using Morris Water Maze (MWM) , on old and young C57BL/6 mice tre ated with CAW 2 mg/ml in their drinking water. CAW exposure continued for 2 weeks prior to the beginning of b ehavioral testing and throughout the test period. CAW improved performance in the MWM in aged animals and had a modest effect on the performance of young animals. CAW also increased the expression of mitochondrial and antioxidant response genes in the brai n and liver of both young and old animals. Expression of synaptic markers was also increased in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, but not in the cerebellum of CAW -treated animals. (Gray et al. 2016) Chintapanti et al. 2018 evaluated the protective effect s of Centella asiatica (CA) leaf extract on behavioral deficits and neurotoxicity in adult rat exposed to lead during perinatal period. Powdered dried leaves (100 g) were extracted in cold percolation with water for 24 h. The extract was recovered and this process was repeated four times. The extracts were pooled together, combined, and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure and then air -dried, giving 11.09 \u00b1 1.29 g of extract. Adult Wistar rats were exposed to 0.15% lead acetate (Pb) from gestation day 6 through drinking water and the pups were exposed lactationally to Pb till weaning. Oral Assessment report on (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 25/68 CA (200 mg the crude extract/kg bw/day) during post -weaning period provid ed significant protection against Pb -induced behavioral impairments (mainly significant improvements in open-field behaviour and in water maz e behaviour were obtained). In addition, CA induced a partial recovery of AChE activity in different brain regions of Pb-exposed rats. Finally, dministrat ion of CA to Pb-exposed rats, showed significant increases in SOD, catalase, GPx and glutathione reductase activities, and GSH levels, and a decrease in MDA level in different regions of the brain, indicating recovery from oxidative stress. CA did not chel ate Pb in brain regions and blood, suggesting that the possible neuroprotective effects may be due to its antioxidant potential but not by lowering effects of brain Pb content. (Chintapanti et al. 2018) The effects of a water extract of Centella asiatica (CAW) was evaluated in the 5xFAD mouse model of A-accumulation. A total of 1200 g of dried aerial parts were refluxed with 15 L of water for 1.5 h, in several small batches. After filtering the extract to remove plant debris, the liquid was freeze dried to produce 245 g of CAW powder. Seven month old female 5xFAD mice and their female WT littermates were either exposed to CAW in their drinking water at 2 g/L or to untreated water for two weeks prior to the beginning of behavioral testing and throughout the tests. Learning, memory and executive function were assessed using the object location memory task (OLM), conditioned fear response (CFR) and odor discrimination reversal learning (ODRL) test. CAW improved performance in all behavioral tests in the 5xFAD b ut had no effect on WT animals. (Gray et al. 2018b) Anticonvulsivant effects Anxiolytic plants may interact with decarboxylase (GAD) or GABA transaminase (GABA -T) and ultimately influence brain GA BA and neurotransmission. An aqueous e xtract from Centella asiatica stimulated GAD activity by over 40% at a dose of 1 mg/ml. The alcoholic Centella asiatica extract dose -dependently increased the GABA level in rats. (Awad et al. 2007) The anticonvu lsant effect of n-hexane, chloroform, e thyl acetate, n-butanol and water leaf extracts of Centella asiatica were investigated with respect to cholinergic activity on pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) - induced seizures. Convulsions were induced in adult male Wistar ra ts with an intraperitoneal injection of PTZ 60 mg/kg bw dissolved in saline. Treatment with all the extracts except aqueous extract at 200 mg/kg bw 1 week prior to dose of PTZ showed significant protection against PTZ -induced convulsions. N-hexane, ethyl acetate and n-butanol extracts resulted in a more pronounced effect than chloroform extract. (Visweswari et al. 2010 a) The same group of authors found that the activities of Na+, K+-ATPase, Mg2+-ATPase, and Ca2+-ATPase and after treatment with different Centella asiatica extracts which in general is decreased after PTZ induced epilepsy in all the above brain regions. (Visweswari et al. 2010 b). Manasa & Sachin (201 6) evaluated the anticonvulsant action of aqueous extract of Centella asiatica and compared it with sodium valproate in PTZ-induced seizures in albino mice. The aqueous extract was prepared by cold maceration method. The plants were air dried and powdered. Thirty grams of the dry powder was soake d in 200 mL of cold water at room temperature. The extract was filtered, and the filtrate was dried at room temperature in a steady air current. Animals, which received 100 mg/kg of aqueous extract of Centella asiati ca, exhibited significant delay in the o nset of seizures ( p<0.001) and suppression of clonic seizure ( p<0.01) when compared with control non-treated group , and it was statistically significant. The aqueous extract of Centella asiatica at a d ose of 300 mg/k g exhibited complete suppression of seiz ures, and its anticonvulsant activity is comparable to sodium valproate (Manas a & Sachin 2016 ). The anti convulsivant activity of aqueous leaf extract of Centella asiatica was evaluated in Maximal Electroshock induced (MES) Seizures and PTZ-induced seizures in Wistar albino rats. About 500 g of Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 26/68 powdered dried leaves were boiled in hot water for 30 min, allowed to coo l and filtered using a piece of white cotton gauze. The fi ltrate was evaporated to dry at room temperatu re. The aqueous leaf e xtract of Centella asiatica significantly increased the time of onset of Tonic Hind Limb Extension (THLE) in all the doses (200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg) used, and decreased the duration of THLE significantly with 400 mg/kg when compared t o control group. The percentage of prote ction of MES seizures with 400 mg/kg is 67%. PTZ -induced seizures, the aqueous extract of Centella asiatica significantly increased the mean latency period in all the doses used. The percentage of protection of PT Z-induced seizures with 200 mg/kg of extract wa s 33% and 400 mg/kg was 67%. Stand ard drugs like phenytoin in MES - induced seizures and diazepam in P TZ-induced seizures possesses 100% seizure protection (Umamageswari et al. 2015). Cytotoxic and anti -prolifer ative effects An aqueous extract of Centella asiatica (50 g/L), obtained by infusion followed by cold maceration for 24 h, was active against human breast cancer (MDA -MB 231) and mouse melanoma (B16F1) while (C6) the IC 50 was 1,000.0 g /mL. On the other hand, the extract was not cytotoxic at the tested concentrations (up to 1,000.0 g/mL) towards the human lung carcinoma (A549) and normal hamster kidney (BHK -21) cell lines. (Pittella et al. 2009) An aqueous extract of Centella asiatica enhanced the cytotoxic effect in the adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cell line. Dri ed and milled leaves and tender stems of Centella asiatica were extracted with distilled water to obt ain a 10 % w/v concentration. T he mixture was incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h, refluxed, vacuum filtered, and then s terilized using 0.4 micron filters followed by a 0.2 micron filter. Ten grams of the p lant powder was extracted using 100 mL of distilled water to o btain a final concentration of 10 % v/v. A549cells exposed to 25 % and 30 % (v/v) Centella asiatica extract showed cell granulation and debris in the culture medium . IC 50 value of bleomycin on A549 cells was 100 \u00b5g/mL, and was reduced to 80 \u00b5g/mL when cells w ere co -incubated with 20% v/v of Centell a asiatica extract. (Wu et al. 2016) The cytotoxic effects of the plant different extracts (methanol, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane and distilled water) of Centella asiatica were using cell proliferat ion -7, carcinoma A549 and HeLa cancerous cell lines. Centella asiatica acetone extract showed the most significant activity, with IC 50 value of 53.65 \u00b1 0.06 g/ml against MCF-7 and 46. 49 \u00b1 0.04 g/ml for A549. The water extracts were the least active and showed IC 50 value of >100 g/ml for MCF -7, Caco -2 \u00b1 0.06 g/ml for HeLa. Doxorubicine, used as a drug , showed the following IC 50: (1.26 et 2018) . Rai et al. (2011) examined the chemopreventive potential of Centella asiatica extract on 7,12 - -induced skin tumor igenesis in male Swiss albino mice (15 -20 g). DMBA was used to initiate skin carcinogenesis and croton oil to promote it to a visible tumour. Twenty - five grams of powdered dried whole plant was taken for aqueous extraction through soxhlet apparatus and ref luxed for 2 -3 days at 60\u00baC. After the co mplete extraction, the extract was kept it in water bath 45C for removing the solvent and the dry powder was obtained. Centella asiatica extract , topically applied at the dose of 500 and 1000 mg/kg bw at the pre pro motion phase , showed a significant reduc tion in tumor incidence, and, cumulative number of papillomas compared to carcinogen control group (DMBA + cotron oil) . The effect was more pronounced with the dose of 1000 mg/kg bw. (Rai et al. 2011) The effects of Centella asiatica leaves water extract o n decreasing the number of benzo(a)pyrene - induced lung tumor nodules was investigated on 30 of one day old baby mice. The average number of tumor nodules obtained in the positive control group of benzo(a) pyrene is 5 .60\u00b12.07. The mean Assessment report (L.) Urb ., herba significant ly different ( p<0.05) compared with the group which treated with water extract of Centella asiatica leaves doses of 500 and 750mg/kg bw (2.20\u00b10.83 and 2.60\u00b11.14, respectively). Whereas, when compare d to extract with dose of 250 mg/kg bw shows no significan t difference (p>0.05). The smallest number of tumor was observed in the g roups of mice given t amoxifen (2.00\u00b11.58 on average) . The results show no significant differences ( p<0.05) in the group of mice which given wat er extract of Centella asiatica doses 50 0 and 750 mg/kg bw (average 2.20\u00b10.83 and 2.60\u00b11.14, respectively) . Microscopic examination of lung histopathological features of Centella - treated mice showed a decrease on tumor foci in bronchus, alveolar septum and an inhibition of bronchial epithelial c ell hyperplasia (Hamid et al. 2016) Hypolipidemic effects The anti -hyperlipidemic p roperties of Centella asiatica were studied in in hyperlipidemic rats fed with high-colesterol diet . The dried plant powder (100 g) was dissolved in 1000 mL of distilled wat er for 72 h with occasional shaking. The extract was further filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. Centella asiatica extracts at doses of 0.25 g/kg, 0.5 g/kg or 1 g/g bw/day up to 28 days and fenofibrate remarkably lowered the level of TC, TG, LDL -C, and showed elevated levels of HDL-C, SOD. The histopathological observations further demonstrated clear differentiation and structural changes in liver of high colesterol fed and Centella asi atica treated group s. (Kumar i et al. 2016) Antimicrobial effects Centella asiatica , has been used in India in leprosy patients. It is considered that asiaticoside, acts on the waxy covering of M. leprae . The in vitro effect of an indigenously produced dry powder of Centella asiatica on the acid -fastness and viability of M. tuberculosis was investigated showing that Centella asiatica may not have any direct action on the acid -fastness or viability of M. tuberculosis H37Rv in vitro. For this study Centella as iatica stock solution was prepared by wei ghing 60 mg of the powder of Centella asiatica and dissolving it in 3 ml of M/15 phosphate buffer pH 7.0 (Herbert et al. 1994). The antimicrobial effects of methanol and water extracts of Centella showed highest inhibition against M. glutamicus (25 mm), followed by K. pneumonea and E.coli and lowe st against E. aerogens and P. vulgaris (15 mm) with 50 mg/ml DMSO concentration. The water extracts showed highest inhibition against M. glutamicus (40 mm) and least against K. pneumonea (18 mm) with 250 mg/ml DMSO concentration (Kunta & Vadlapudi 2009). Methanol, acetone, chloroform and water ext racts of leaf and callus of Centella asiatica in varying concentrations ranging 10 to 100 \u00b5g/L were evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus , Escherichia coli , Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by agar plate well diffusion method. All the leaf and callus extracts showed dose dependent anti-bacterial activity. The maximum growth of inhibition (30 mm) was observed in methanol extract of leaves at 100 \u00b5g/mL against E. coli , which was followed by B. cereus (29 mm), P. aeruginosa and S. aureus (28 mm). Similarly, methanol extract of in vitro grown callus at the concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL showed maximum growth of inhibition (29 mm) against P. aeruginosa , E. coli and S. aureus which was followed by B. cereus (28 mm). Meth anol extract of leaf and callus at the con centration of 10, 25 and 50 \u00b5g/ mL also showed significant activity (24 -27 mm of zone of inhibition) against all the tested organisms. The aqueous and acetone extracts of le af and callus were found to be less effect ive and chloroform extract of leaf and callus showed moderate zone of inhibition against all the tested organisms in the present study (Arumugam et al. 2011). Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 28/68 al. (2018) evaluated the anti -microbial act ivity of different extracts of Centella as iatica extracted (1:10 w/v) in methanol, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane and distilled water. The dried extra cts were used. In the agar diffusion assay , the methanolic extract had the highest antibacterial activity towards S. agalactiae with zone of inhibition of 29 \u00b1 0.4 mm; the inhibition zones for methanolic extracts on other microorganisms ranged 9 \u00b1 1.0 mm (P. vulgaris ) to 19 \u00b1 2.0 mm ( E. avium ). The MIC for all the extracts of Centella asiatica ranged 0.63 mg/ml (acetone extract towards E. Coli ) to > 10 mg/ml. The water extract has the lowest antimicrobial activity (Soyingbe et al. 2018). Gastro -protective and anti -ulcer effects Centella asiatica extract, prepared boiling 30 g of the plant in 600 ml of distilled water under reflux for 1 hour , orally adminis tered (0.05 g/kg, 0.25 g/kg and 0.50 g/kg) before ethanol administration, significantly inhibited gast ric lesions formation (58% to 82% reduction) , decreased mucosal myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and acc elerated its recovery in a dose dependent manner. The data suggest that Centella asiatica extract preven ts ethanol induced gastric mucosal lesions by strengthening the mucosal barrier and reduci ng the damaging effects of free radicals (Cheng & Koo 2000). In another study, the healing effects of Centella asiatica water extract and asiaticoside on acetic acid induced gastric ulcers in rats were examined. Thirty grams of Centella asiatica was boiled in 600 ml of distilled water under reflux for one hour. The solution was then filtered and freeze -dried to obtain the powder, which was re-dissolved in distilled water immediately before use. The water extract and asiaticoside were found to reduce the size o f the ulcers at day 3 and 7 in a dose -dependent manner, with a concomitant attenuation of myelop eroxidase activity at the ulcer tissues. Epithelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis were on the othe r hand promo ted. The expression of basic fibroblast growth factor, an important angiogenic factor, was also up regulated in the ulcer tissues in rats treated with Centella asiatica or asiaticoside. Similar effects were observed after 0.25 Centella asiatica water extract or 10 mg/kg asiaticoside administrat ion. (Cheng et al. 2004). 3.1.3. Safety pharmacology No data availab le. 3.1.4. Pharmacodynamic interactions No data available. 3.1.5. Conclusions The wound healing effects of Centella asiatica have been extensively investigated bot h in vivo and in vitro mainly using alcoholi c extracts of the whole plant, herb and leaves. Incision, excision and burn wound models have been used. Centella asiatica extracts , mainly applied topically, accelerate wound healing stimulating epithelisation a nd increasing the rate of wound contraction by promoting cellular proliferation and collagensynthsis at wound site. Asiaticoside and madecassoside are the main single constituents studied in wound healing. The mechanisms involved seem to be enhancement of collagen synthesis and anti -oxidant activit y. Although animal studies have been carried out with herbal preparations different from those reported Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 29/68 the above non -clinical in vivo /in vitro evidences support the traditional u se of Centella asiatica to aid in healing of minor wounds. 3.2. Overview of available pharmacokinetic data regarding the herbal substance(s), herbal preparation(s) and relevant constituents thereof Pharmacokinetics No information is available on Centella asiat ica, except for standardized and highly puri fied extracts . The potential modulatory effects of asiaticoside, a nd madecassic acid and four extracts (hexane, dichloromethane, ethanol and water) prepared sequentially from whole plant of Centella asiatica were examined inhibited CYP2C9 activities in general with IC 50 values of more than 100 \u00b5g/ml (IC 50 of 599.0, 11 7.9 and 1070.2 \u00b5 g/ml, respectively) . On other hand, ethanol extract, dichloromethane extract, asiatic acid and madecassic acid showed significant inhibition on CYP2C9 activities with IC 50 values less than 100 \u00b5g/ml (IC 50 of 28.3, 17.2 , 33.1 \u00b5g/ml and 40.8 \u00b5g/ml, respectively). The four Centella asiatica extracts and asiaticoside did not exhibit significant inhibition on catalytic activity of CYP2D6 in this study (IC 50 values above 100 \u00b5g/ml). Only asiatic acid and significant inhibition on CYP3A4 activity, while asiaticoside and madecassic acid did not significantly inhibit CYP3A4 activities as w ell (all having IC 50 above 100 \u00b5g/ml). Asiat ic acid was the only component exhibiting significant inhibition on CYP3A4 with an IC 50 value of 53.6 g/ml. (Pan et al. 2010) An ethanolic extract of Centella asiatica leaves showed significant inhibition of both CYP1A2 (IC 50 = 42.23\u00b13.65 g/mL) en zyme (IC 50 = 48.41\u00b14.64 g/mL ) in a competitive manner with respect to methanolic, hydromethanolic (methanol and water in equal ratio) and water extracts of Centella asiatica leaves (IC 50 >100 g/mL) in human microsomes. In addition, the flavonoids, quercetin and kaempferol showed potent (IC 50 values less than 10 M) inhibition of CYP1A2 activity with no significant inhibition of CYP2C9 enzyme. (Savai et al. 2015) The IC 50 determined for a methanolic extract of whole plant of Centella asiatica asiatica to potentiate the gabapentin, phenytoin and valproate in PTZ-induced seizure in ICR mice but decrease the anti -epileptic effect of phenobarbital in maxima l electroshock -induced seizure model in Wist ar rat. (Fong et al. 2014) The effects of Centella asiatica on the pharmacokinetic of amitriptyline in rats was studied by Khurshid et al. (2018). Male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into two groups (n = 6 each) which were served as a control (am itriptyline alone) and treatment group (a mitriptyline with Centella asiatica ), respectively. Rats Centella asiatica (62.5 mg/kg, p.o. daily for 7 days), then administered a sin gle amitriptyline dose (25 mg/kg, p.o.) on d ay 8. The coadministration of Centella asiatica with amitriptyline resulted in increased C AUC and t 1/2 by 14.34, 22.84 , and 13.81%, respectively. (Khurshid et al. Centella asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 30/68 3.3. Overview of available toxicologica l data regarding the herbal substance(s)/her bal preparation(s) and constituents thereof 3.3.1. Single dose toxicity In the mouse, acute toxicity was not shown for oral administration of 1 g/kg bw of an ethanolic 50% extract of intrap eritoneal administration, the maximum tolera ted dose (MTD) in mice was found by Dhar et al. (1968) to be 250 mg/kg bw. Alcoholic extracts of Centella asiatica have shown no toxicity at doses of 350 mg/kg when given i.p. to rats (Alternative Medicine Review 2007). The oral LD 50 of a 70% ethanolic dry extract from Centella asiatica 6:1 in rats was found to be higher than 675 mg/kg bw (ESCOP 2009). In mice, a dose of 1 g/kg bw of an alcoholic (50:50) Centella asiatica extract did not lead to any toxic effects (no raw data are available). No mortality w as recorded. High concentrations of asiaticoside applied on derma did not give rise to any signs of systemic toxicity. The standardised extract ECa 233 was administrated at 10.0 g/kg into 10 male and 10 female IC R mice (20 - 22 g). The extract at the given dose did not cause any toxic signs and death within the observation period of 1 4 days. (Chivapat et al. 2011) Oral single dose acute toxicity study of aqueous mixture of Centella asiatica whole plant powder on female SD rats showed no toxic effects on beh aviour, body weight, food and water intake. All rats were observed for 14 days prior to necropsy. No death was found throughout the study period. Necropsy revealed no significant abnormality. LD 50 value was deter mined as > 2000 mg/kg. ( Global Information Hub On Integrated Medicine, Centella asiatica (L.) Urban. Malaysian Herbal Monograph ) The acute toxicity of an ethanolic extract (obtained by Soxhlet extraction of the whole plant at 72 -82\u00b0C for 72 h) was evaluate d in Swiss albino mice (25 - 30 g). The anim als were divided into experimental groups of 6 animals each (3 male and 3 female ). Group 1 received 10 \u00b5l/g of distilled water and served as control; the other groups were treated with ethanolic extract of Centel la asiatica (ECA) at doses of 300, 600, 1200 and 2000 mg/kg respectively. All treatments were administered once by oral gavage. Animals were closely observed for 4 hours following administration and once a day for 14 days. No deaths were recorded within 72 hours in LD 50 assay after administration of the extracts and no death was recorded after 14 days. No signs of toxicity were observed in animal groups after the treatment with ECA 300, ECA 600, ECA 1200 and ECA 2000 mg/kg. It was not observed any significa nt alterations in serum levels of SGOT, SGPT , and alkaline phosphatase and histopathological analysis did not show liver damage. (Yadav et al. 2019) 3.3.2. Repeat dose toxicity Chronic oral administration of a hydoalcoholic extract from Centella asiatica to rats at 150 mg/kg for 30 days led to no significa nt differences in body weight or consumption of food and water, nor to changes in plasma glucose, proteins, cholesterol or triglycerid levels, compared to controls. No macroscopic alteration in internal organs wa s evident (ESCOP 2009). Repeated topical ap plication of an asiaticoside mixture has been associated with a tumour -growth - promoting effect in mice (Laerum and Iversen 1972). Since empirical material is lacking, it is not possible to extrapolate the data to humans. Oral administration of dried, powde red, muslinised, aerial parts of Centella asiatica in Wistar albino rats (n = 24; weight not reported) in different doses (250, 500 and 1,000 mg/kg/bw) over a period of 30 days did not produce any clinical signs of toxicity, morbidity, mortality with no ef fect on gross Assessment report on ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 31/68 behavioural effects. All the treated rats exhibited normal activities as that of the control group (administered with distilled water). All the four groups (control and treatment) of rats showed a s teady gain in their body weight during the e ntire study period. The changes in hematological parameters between the control and treatment groups were statistically signific ant but all are in normal physiological range. After 30 days, oral administration of Centella asiatica resulted in a significant increase in the levels of ALT, AST in a dose -dependent manner. The concentration of tissue total protein in treated groups were also significantly higher than the control group. The conc entration of BUN and c reatinine in treated groups were also higher th an the control group. There was statistically significant decrease in liver viability count in treatment groups in comparison to the control group. The viable count in kidney was also reduced mainly in groups tre ated with 500 and 1,000 mg/kg compared to the control group. No significant differences were seen for the total viable count in heart between treated and control groups. Histopathology also revealed a significant hepatic damage and a moderate degree of cha nges in the renal tissue. The authors conclu ded that the administration of Centella asiatica at 1,000 mg/ kg bw for a period of 30 days may cause a significant damage to liver tissue in rats. (Oruganti et al. 2010) Sub-chronic toxicity study of ECa 233 was investigated in four groups of Wistar rats ( 180 - 220 g), each of 24 rats (12 of each sex). Control group was orally given distilled water and three experimental groups were orally administered with ECa 233 in distilled water at the doses of 10, 100, and 1 ,000 mg/kg/day for 90 days. All ECa 233 -treated rats showed no difference with regards to body weight, food consumption and organs weight in comparison to the control group except that female rats receiving 1,000 mg/kg/day of ECa 233 had lower food consump tion, relative right adrenal weight, and higher white blood cell counts than the control group ( p<0.05). Eosinophils in the female groups receiving ECa 233 at 10 and 1,000 mg/kg/day were significantly lo wer than those of their control group ( p<0.05). Clinical chemistry values of all ECa 233 -treated, male and female, groups were not significantly different from those of their sex -corresponding control groups, except male rats receiving 1,000 mg/kg/day of ECa 233 which had significantly higher sodium level, b ut still within normal range, than those of control group ( p<0.05). Male rats receiving ECa 233 at 10 mg/kg/day had a significantly higher incidence of lymphoid proliferation in the lung and centrilobular fatty degeneration in the liver than their control group. However, there was clearly no exacerb ation of changes or increase of effect at higher dose of 100 and 1,000 mg/kg/day were noted. The incidences of gut associated lymphoid tissue ( GALT) proliferation in the small intestine of female rats receiving E Ca 233 at the doses of 10 and 1,000 mg/kg/da y were significantly lower than those observed in their respective control groups. In summary, h istopathological results of internal organs did not demonstrate any incidence or degree of lesions in a dose -depende nt manner with the increasing dose of ECa 23 3. (Chivapat et al. 2011) The sub -chronic toxicity of an ethanolic extract (obtained by Soxhlet extraction of the whole plant at 72-82\u00b0C for 72 h) was evaluated in Swiss albino mice (25 - 30 g). The animals were divided into experimental groups of 6 animal s each (3 male and 3 female). Group 1 received 10 \u00b5l/g of distilled water and se rved as control; the other groups were treated with ethanolic extract of Centella asiatica (ECA) at doses of 300, 600, 1200 and 2000 mg/kg respectively. All treatments were adm inistered once by oral gavage daily 7 days each week for 28 days. No death was recorded for 28 days extract administration. Animal treated with ECA showed weight gain throughout the entire experiment duration. Th e increase was the same in treated and contr ol group animals, and the treatment did not affect relative organs weights, food, and water intake. Treatment with ECA at all doses did not produce any changes on animal haematological parameters and did not prod uce any statistically significant changes on urea, c reatinine, SGOT, SGPT and alkaline phosphatase. At the four evaluated doses, it was not observed any tissue damage on the kidney, heart, liver and brain of mice. (Yadav et al. 2019) Assessment report on Centella have been investigated on Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 and in human lymphocytes. Edible parts of eight plants were washed well with water. The plant (300 g) was homogenised with 300 ml distilled water using a home -mixer, and the mixture was then centrifuged at 4\u00b0C, 9000 g for 30 minutes. The supernatants of the extract was freeze -dried and then stored at -20\u00b0C. Centella asiatica at doses of 2 mg/plate and 5 mg/plate showed an timutagenic activity in the Ames test and an y toxic activity (Yen et al. 2001) Pure triterpenoids of Centella asiatica have been reported to cause alteration in gene expression in human fibroblast and recently asiaticoside has been shown to induce type I c ollagen synthesis in human dermal fibroblast . Leaf samples dried in the dark at 50\u00b0C for 48 hours were powdered. Powder (1 g) was extracted by sonication (3\u00d710 min) with 3\u00d710 ml of 90% MeOH. The dried crude extract was dissolved in 90% MeOH and filtered (p ore size: 0.45 m) prior to HPLC analysis (Randriamampionona et al. 2007) The antigenotoxic effect of Centella asiatica extract was studied on human lymphocytes using chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges as parameters against the genotoxi c effect induced by cyproterone acetate (CPA), a synthetic progestin known to be not only a genotoxic agent but also a tumour initiating agent. Centella asiatica leaves were collected, dried and ground to fine powder. Extraction was performed by soaking sa mples (30 gm of dry weight) in 300 ml of acetone for 8-10 hours at 40 -60\u00b0C in Soxhlet's apparatus. A clear dose dependent decrease in the genotoxic damage of CPA was observed, suggesting a protective role of Centella asiatica extract during CPA therapy. Th e results suggest that the leaf extract per se does not have genotoxic potential, but can modulate the genotoxicity of CPA on human lymphocytes in vitro (Siddique et al. 2008). 3.3.4. Carcinogenicity Asiaticoside has been implicated as a possible skin carcinogen in rodents after repeated topical application while was tested for carcinogenicity by topical applications to the skin of hairless mice. A short -term tetrazolium test indicated that compo und was weak carcinogen . The compound was painted twice weekly on the dorsal skin up to about 20 months; some of the mice had previously been initiated with a small dose of 20 -methylcholanthrene (MCA). A control group which received only the solvent benzene after MCA initiation was also studied. These carcinomas did not app ear before about 16 months of observation. Before this, the painted, MCA -initiated animals had a significantly lower number of papillomas of the skin than the corresponding control group with only benzene treatment. By systematic autopsy it was found that about 30% of the corresponding MCA -initiated, benzene or asiaticoside -treated animals had such neoplasms. Asiaticoside was used at a concentration of 0.10% in benzene. Asiaticoside dissolved in benzene gave an increased yield of papillomas and also 2.5% sk in sarcomas of the animals, indicating an effect on the dermis as well. Asiaticoside did not produce necrosis or acantholysis of the skin and did not appear to be toxic (Laerum & Iversen 1972). 3.3.5. Reproductive and developmental toxicity In vitro anti-infertil ity activity against human and rat sperm has been described for the total saponin fraction. Asiaticoside and brahminoside are thought to be active components, although no spermicidal or spermostatic action has been demonstrated for the pure saponins . Orall y administered crude extract of Centella asiatica has been reported to si gnificantly reduce fertility of female mice. Teratogenicity studies were conducted in rabbits and they reported negative results for Centella extract containing asiatic acid, madecass ic acid, madasiatic acid and asiaticoside (EMEA 1998 , Barnes et al. 2007 ). Centella asiatica (L.) Urb leaf extract on the induction of spermatogenic cells w ere studied in adult Wistar albino male rats (250 \u00b1 10 g). Dried leaves were powdere d and then subjected to exhaustive extraction in ethanol. Forty adult male rats were equally divided in five groups: one control and four experimental groups. During the experiment, the crude extract was dissolved in distilled water and administered orally to rats at a concentration of 10, 50, 80, and 100 mg/kg body weight in 1 ml volume as single daily doses for 8 weeks using animal feeding gavage. Similarly, the controls received gavage of 1 ml of distilled water in the same schedule as the experimental r ats. When compared to the control group, statistically significant ( p<0.01 or p<0.001) reductions in sperm viability and motility were noted in each group dosed with Centella asiatica leaf extract. In each experimental group, histopathological examination of the testis revealed a significant ( p value not stated) decrease in the number of spermatogenic cells (spermatogonia, spermatocyte, spermatid, and sperm) in the seminiferous tubules. Also, when compared to the control group, intertubular spaces and venou s congestion were increased in experimental groups. The authors noted that the reported loss in testicular weight likely corresponded to a dose -dependent decrease in mean spermatogenic cells in seminiferous tubules. At the 100 mg/kg/day dose, the mean numb er of sperms from the cauda epididymis (x 106) was 36.7 \u00b1 4.8, compared to a mean value (control) of 61.60 \u00b1 2.34; this difference was statistically significant ( p<0.001). Additionally, degeneration of seminiferous tubules was r eported. It was concluded th at Centella asiatica leaf extract was toxic to the reproductive system of male rats. (Heidari et al. 2012) A study was performed to evaluate the effects of Centella asiatica (ethanol extract) on the rat testis. The following group of 8 male SD rats (dosed orally) were used in the study: low -dose group (100 mg/kg), mid -dose group (200 mg/kg), high -dose group (300 mg/kg), and control group (distilled water). The groups were force fed for 42 consecutive days, after which the animals were killed and the testis removed for histological examination. Animals of all d ose groups had some degeneration of spermatogenic cells and reduction of spermatozoa in the lumen of the seminiferous tubules. When compared to the control group, the serum testosterone level decreased in a dose -dependent manner and there was a significant decrease in cauda epididymal sperm count. A statistically significant reduction ( p<0.05) in sperm count was observed in the 200 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg dose groups, but not in the 100 mg/kg dose group. Differences in sp erm motility were also observed. Slow or sluggish progressive sperm motility was reported for the control and 100 mg/kg dose g roup. Non -progressive motility ( < 5 \u00b5m/second) was reported for both the 200 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg dose groups. In co ntrol animals, the testis had normal features, with successive stages of transformation of the seminiferous epithelium into spermatozoa. However, abnormalities in seminiferous tubules were observed in all dose groups. Complete arrest of the seminiferous tu bules was observed only in the 300 mg/kg dose group. It was concluded that Centella asiatica extract (ethanol extract) was a reproductive toxicant in male rats. (Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel, 2015). The antifertility properties of an ethanolic e xtract of Centella asiatica were studied in 32 male SD rats (250-300 g). The ethanol extract was prepared by extracting Centella asiatica powder macerated with ethanol (90%) at 55 \u00b0C to 60\u00b0C for 36 h. Then, the ethanol was removed from the extract and the extract was concentrated to dryness using a rotary evaporator. Rats were divided into two groups: control group (n=16) received distilled water and treatment group (n=16) which received 300 mg/kg of Centella asiatica extract orally for 42 d. After the treat ment period, the number of implantation sites was recorded, and the sperm proteomic changes were analysed by 2D gel electrophoresis. In addition, the expression of protein spots was quantified by MALDI -TOF analysis. Female SD rats were placed individually i n a cage with a treated male rat for five days. The day that the sperm appeared in the vaginal smear was considered as day 1 of pregnancy. On the 17th day, the animals were laparotomized under light ether anesthesia and the number of implants in t he uterin e horns was recorded. Centella asiatica extract resulted in low number of implantation sites in the treatment group (100.00\u00b12.82) compared to the control group (183.00\u00b12.14). The percentage of infertile male rats in Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 34/68 the treatment group was higher (43.75%) compared to the control group (18. 75%). Proteomic analysis showed the expression of protein spots identified in the treatment group decreased with 234 spots compared to the control group with 282 spots. (Yunianto et al. 2017) Akbar et al. (2018) e xamined t he influence of the ethanol extract of Centella asiatica towards the birth rates or fertility in the early post -implantation. Dried powdered leaves were macerated with 70% polar ethanol for 24 hours and repeatedly 3 times to obtain soluble and sof t; the ch opped leaf extract was used for the experiment. The research design used was complete randomized d esign with 4 treatments and 6 replications respectively. A total of 24 adult SD female rats were distributed into 12 trays/cages grouped into 4 group s. After mating, pregnant rats were grouped into 4 treatment groups: group I (control group), group II (dose 175 mg/kg bw), group III (a dose of 200 mg/kg bw) and Group IV (dose 225 mg/kg bw ). Rats were treated on the 6th day until the 9th day of pregnancy . After 1 5 days, the value of post -implantation death percentage is calculated by counting the number of implantation, either containing a live fetus, or dead fetus and embryo resorb. In Group III and Group IV treatments, it was clear that there were no li ving fetu ses and there was an acceptably higher embryo rate than Group I and Group II treatments. The percentage of post -implantation death was significantly higher in groups III and IV compared to control group (57,23% and 56.23%, respectively vs 0%; p<0.05). The deterioration of male reproductive health is one of the major manifestations of occupational and/or environmental exposure to Pb toxicity. Sainath et al. (2011 ) investi gated the effects of an aqueous extract of Centella asiatica (powdered whole pl ant) on l ead-induced oxidative stress and suppressed reproductive performance in male rats. The animals were equally randomized to four groups, six per group. The rats in group I served as control and was allowed ad libitum access to tap water. The animals in group s II were allowed ad libitum access to tap water containing 819 mg/L lead (0.15% lead acetate) for 70 days. Rats in group III were given orally aqueous extracts of Centella asiatica (200 mg/kg bw/day) over a period of 70 days and the animals in gr oup IV re ceived same experimental regimen as that of group II and in addition, the aqueous extracts of Centella asiatica (CA) was also given orally for a period of 70 days. The indices of testis and epididymis were significantly decreased in lead treated r ats over control animals. No significant changes in the testis and epididymis indices were observed in CA alone treated rats when compared with control rats, whilst in rats coadministrated with CA the weights of testis and epididymis were comparable to con trol grou p and significantly higher than those observed in rats treated with Pb. No significant changes in sperm parameters were observed in rats after CA administration. On the other hand, significant decrease was observed in epididymal sperm count, sperm viabilit y, sperm motility and also percentage of number of hyposmotic swelling (HOS)-tail coiled sperms in rats exposed to lead for 70 days. Co-administration of CA treatment significantly increased the selected sperm variables in lead acetate exposed rat s when co mpared with Pb treated rats . Significant decrease in the testicular 3 - and 17 -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities were observed in Pb exposed rats as compared to control rats. No effect of CA on these enzymes was noted when administered to n ormal ani mals. On the other hand, co -administration of CA with lead had significantly increased both these enzymes when compared with Pb treated rats but still lower than the control levels. (Sainath et al. 2011) 3.3.6. Local tolerance A sensitising effect of the triterpe ne fraction potential cause of allergic contact dermatitis has been confirmed in animal experiments. Skin hyperkeratinisatio n at the application site has been observed after the application of high concentrations of asiaticoside applied on derma ( EMEA 1998 ). 3.3.7. Other special studies No data available Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 35/68 3.3.8. Conclusions No signs of acute oral toxicity were seen in mice and rats with Centella asiatica up to doses of 2000 mg/kg. In the study by Oruganti et al. (2010) signs of liver and kidney toxicity were obs erved for the dried, powdered, muslinised, aerial parts of Centella asiatica when orally administered for 30 days at doses of 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg in rats. Specifically, a significant rise of ALT, AST, BUN and creatinine was seen, compared to the contr ol group; in addition, with these doses the liver and kidney cells viability was significantly decreased. The dose of 500 mg/kg corresponds to a human equivalent dose (HED) of 4 g for an adult human weighting 50 kg. On the other hand, in this study the 250 mg/kg do se of powdered aerial parts of Centella asiatica provoked a significant increase of ALT, AST, BUN and creatinine without alteration of viable cell count in liver and kidney compared to control group; no changes of liver and kidneys with the lower dose appe ared by histopathological examination. The dose of 250 mg/kg corresponds to a HED of 2 g for an adult human weighting 50 kg. A subsequent study carried out on rats showed that a standardised extract of Centella asiatica , ECa233, did not cause sign ificant c hronic toxicity when given orally in doses of 10 -1000 mg/kg for 90 days. ALT, AST, BUN and creatinine in treated rats did not differ significantly compared to control group. The histopathological examination did not show any alteration in kidneys of treate d rats up to 1000 mg/kg. A centrilobular fatty degeneration was seen in liver of 5/12 rats treated with 10 mg/kg of ECa233 ( p<0.05 compared to control group), but this alteration was less frequent in rats receiving 1000 mg/kg (1/12, no statistical differen ce with the control group). (C hivap at et al. 2011) The study by Yadav et al. (2012) did not show any significant effect of an ethanolic extract of Centella asiatica given orally to mice for 30 days up to doses of 2000 mg/kg (HED ~ 8 g for an adult human weighting 50 kg). No alteration of urea, creatinine, SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase and no damage to liver an d kidney tissues were observed. There were no relevant abnormalities/ no adverse effects of Centella asiatica on hematology effect of Centella asiatica on heart and brain of rats and mice at very high doses. A bronchiolar associated lymphoid tissue proliferation was detected in lung of male rats in the study by Chipavat , although this was statisticall y signifi cant only at doses of 10 mg/kg and not at higher doses. The dried, powdered, aerial parts of Centella asiatica caused an increase of weight of the spleen without pathologal lesions; the microscopic section of spleen showed hypercellularity and hyperplasia with doses of 500 mg/ kg or higher which w as associated by the authors to immunosuppressive effect of Centella asiatica . The effects on the sple en were not observed in the study by Chipavat. Centella asiatica water extract was not mutagenic in an Ames test (pre-incubation method) up to 5 mg/plate; only strains TA98 and TA100 were assayed and no information on positive control was provided , therefore further studies are needed to confirm the absence of mutagenicity. Centella asiatica water extract s howed ant i-mutagenic activity. Pure triterpenoids of Centella asiatica have been reported to cause alteration in gene expression in human fibroblasts. Repeated topical application of an asiaticoside mixture has been associated with a tumour -growth -promotin g effect in mice. A further study suggests that the leaf extract per se does not have a genotoxic potential. Adequate tests on carcinogenicity of Centella asiatica have not been performed. Asiaticoside cause d in vitro detrimental effects on human and rat s perm (EMEA 1998) . A recent study demonstrated that Centella asiatica leaf ethanolic extract was toxic to the reproductive system of male rats when administered orally at a concentration of 10, 50, 80, and 100 mg/kg. The sperm motility and viability were si gnificant ly reduced compared to the control group with the lower dose of 10 mg/kg of extract, whereas a significant decrease of sperm count and testis weight was seen at doses of 50 Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 36/68 mg/kg or higher. In addition, doses of 50 mg/kg or higher caused a signifi cant redu ction of testosterone, LH and FSH levels compared to control. A descending trend of spermatogenic cell survival with increas e in extract dose was also observed, starting with doses of 50 mg/kg. Histopathological studies of testis tissue demonstrat ed a sign in the number of spermatogenic cells (spermatogonia, spermatocyte, spermatid and sperm) in the seminiferous tubules in all experimental groups relative to the control group. Intertubular spaces and venous congestion were increased in the t reatment groups compared with those seen in the control group. (Heidari et al. 2012) The oral dose of 50 mg/kg, which caused the antifertility effects observed in male rats in the above - mentioned study, corresponds to a HED of ~ 480 mg for an adul t human w eighting 50 kg. Although referred to a different herbal preparation (ethanolic extract), this dose is below the dose range of 0.6 - 1.8 g reported in literature for the traditional use of dried powdered leaves of Centella asiatica . On the other si de, no ef fect was seen on the weight of testis, ovaries and uterus of male and female rats up to doses of 1000 mg/kg of ECa233 in the study of Chivapat et al. (2011). The antifertility effects of an ethanol ic extract of Centella asiatica were confirmed by a more re cent study. An oral dose of 300 mg/kg given to male rats, corresponding to a HED of ~ 2.8 g for an adult human weighting 50 kg, reduced significantly the number of implants in the uterine horns of female rats compared with the control group. (Yuni anto et al. 2017) Orally administered crude extract of Centella asiatica has been reported to significantly reduce fertility of female mice. An ethanol extract of Centella asiatica at doses of 200 and 225 mg/kg bw significantly reduced birth rate compared to contro l group when given orally to pregnant rats Also the percentage s of post - implantation death were significantly higher in these dose groups copmpared to control. (Akbar et al. 2018) In contrast with the antifertility effects observed with ethanolic extracts reported above , an aqueous extract of Centella asiatica (200 mg/kg/day) showed beneficial effects on lead -induced suppressed reproductive performance in male rats. This extact when co-administered with Pb , counteracted the weight reduction of test is and ep ididymis and the decrease of epididymal sperm count, viable sperms, motile sperms and HOS -tail coiled sperms induced by lead. (Sainath et al. 2011 ) 3.4. Overall conclusions on non -clinical data Several non-clinical studies, mainly in vivo in rats and m ice, carr ied out with alcoholic and water extracts of dried, powdered leaves, aerial parts or whole plant of Centella asiatica , ECa 233, TECA a as a siatic acid, asiaticoside and madecassoside support the traditional use of Centella a siatica to aid in healing in minor wounds. Pharmacokinetic data for Centella asiatica extracts are not available . Alcoholic , dichloromethane, hexane and aqueous extracts did not show any significant inhibition of CYP enzymes in vitro 1A2, dichloromethane extract inhibited only CYP 2C9 in , with IC 50 of amitript yline in rats. Centella asiatica was well tolerated by mice and rats when administered orally up to single doses of 2000 mg/kg. Repeated -dose toxicity studies revealed signs of liver and kidney toxicity of dried, powdered, muslinised, aerial parts of Cente lla asiat ica when orally administered for 30 days at doses of 500 mg/kg (HED ~ 4 g) and 1000 mg/kg in 24 rats; however, ECa233 did no t cause significant chronic toxicity, including liver and kidney toxicity, when given to rats orally in doses of 10 -1000 mg /kg for 9 0 Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba ethanolic extract of Centella asiatica given orally to mice for 30 days up to doses of 2000 mg/kg (HED ~ 8 g ) did not show any toxic effect. A couple of reproductive toxicity studies showed that ethanolic extracts of Centella asiatica were toxic to the reproductive system of male rats when administered orally at a concentration range of 10 - 300 mg/kg. A significant reduction in sperm viability and motility, in the number of spermatogenic cells in the seminiferous tubules with concomitan t decreas e of weight testis and a degeneration of seminiferous tubules were observed. These effects were dose -dependent and started with doses of 50 mg/kg corresponds to a HED of ~ 480 mg for an adult human weighting 50 kg . Furthermore, an ethanol extract of Cente lla asiatica at oral doses of 200 and 225 mg/kg bw significantly reduced birth rate and increased the percentages of post -implantation death compared to control group when given orally to pregnant rats. Some shortcomings in these st udies that limit the ex trapolability of the results observed to humans included the limited number of rats for treatment/control groups and the lack of investigation on potential for reversibility of the effect. In addition, these studies have been carried out using an ethanolic extract , which does not correspond to the herbal preparation reported in the monograph. On the other side, the above -mentioned studies provide evidence of a detrimental effect of ethanolic extracts of Centella asiatic a on fertility of rats at HED doses ev en lower than 0.6 - 1.8 g for which there is enough evidence of traditional use. Therefore, the potential for anti -fertility effects of Centella asiatica in humans when taken orally cannot be completely ruled out. Adequate t ests on genotoxicity and carcin ogenicity have not been performed. 4. Clinical Data 4.1. Clinical pharmacology 4.1.1. Overview of pharmacodynamic data regarding the herbal substance(s)/preparation(s) including data on relevant constituents Clinical pharmacology on Centella asiatica is not well documen ted in humans. 4.1.2. Overview of pharmacokinetic data regarding the herbal substance(s)/preparation(s) including data on relevant constituents Clinical pharmacokinetic data on herbal substance/preparation of Centella asiatic a are not available. Data on single co nstituents and highly purified and standardised extracts (ECa 233, TECA and synonims) have not been included in this assessment report as not dee med relevant for the monograph. 4.2. Clinical efficacy Several clinical studie s reported from literature refer to the following preparations containing Centella asiatica above -mentioned extracts are different d eclaration used to designate the same type of extract containing asiaticosides (40%), asiatic acid (29 -30%), madecassic acid Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 38/68 Information coming from literature and licensed medicinal products confirms that TECA and TTFCA are different acronyms to designate the sam e extract, containing 40% of asiaticoside and 60% of asiatic acid and madecassic acid. TECA is a highly purified extract, fractioned and enriched in triterpenic acid and triterpenic sugar ester fractions to reach about 40% of asiaticoside and about 60% of the triterpenic genins: asiatic acid and madecassic acid. The purification steps are extreme and involve chemical treatments that remove the herbal matrix so that the final extract is a recombination of a highly r efined extract with an isolated constituent and the natural proportion of the components is not maintained. Clinical efficacy of TTFCA and TECA in the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) was investigated in several clinical studies. Improvement of microcirculation and leg volume associa ted with reduction of oedema and symptoms were reported with dose -dependent ameliorating effects. Small clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy of these refined extracts in atherosclerosis, diabetic microangiopa thy, ulcer cicatrisation and burns recovery were also carried out. TECA extract cannot be classified as a n herbal preparation due to the manufacturing steps and composition (see EMA Public statement on Centella asiatica (L.) Urban, herba); therefore, only clinical data coming from other herbal pre parations of Centella asiatica have been reported in this section . 4.2.1. Dose response studies No dose -finding studies have been conducted with Centella asiatica based on data obtained from literature search. 4.2.2. Clinical studies (case studies and clinical trials) Clinical studies on wound healing The clinical efficacy and side effects of the oral Centella asiatica extract capsule in the diabetic wound healing was studied in a prospective randomized control study. Two hundr ed of diabetic foot ulcer Thai patients wer e enrolled into the study. The exclusion criterion were low immune patients, oral steroid intake, age more than 80 year and less than 18 yeas, serum albumin less than 3.0 gm/dl, uncorrected peripheral arterial dis eased patients, and uncontrolled infective wound. The termination criterion were patient refusal, wound infection, delayed primary sutured wound, secondary healing wound. The patients were divided into two groups randomly, group A was Centella asiatica extract capsule group (type of extract not spe cified) and group B was placebo group. The administration was 2 capsules after meal three times a day (50 mg of extracted asiaticoside/capsule in group A). The general symptoms, wound char acteristic, wound size a nd depth were examined at day 7, day 14 and day 21 by the same investigator. Wound contraction was detected by the decrease of the volume of the wound; wound granulation tissue forming was detected by the decrease of wound depth. There were 20 cases droppe d out from the study. One hundred and sevent y cases were analyzed. The author reports significance changes of wound contraction between placebo and study group. The study group trend to be good contraction earlier than placebo group and there were more wou nd granulation tissue forming in the placebo group than the study group. (Paocharoen 2010). The efficacy of an ointment containing Centella asiatica on partial -thickness burn wounds was compared to silver sulfadiazine in a randomized controlled clinical tr ial. Fresh leaves of the plant were air -dried at 40\u00b0 C and powdered. Then, they were subjected to exhaustive extraction using ethanol (96%) and distilled water with the relation of 60:40. The dark green liquid extract was dried and then partitioned between butanol and petroleum ether. It made 2 s eparate portions in which butanol fraction was concentrated under rotary evaporator and vacuum. Dried b utanol fraction was mixed with v aseline and g lycerin to make the ointment which contained about 3% of the final extract. Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 39/68 Patients with second -degree burn wou nds on their limbs treated in Velayat Burning Hospital at Rasht, Iran entered the study. The difference in duration of treatment for complete wound healing was considered as the primary outcome measure. It was ca lculated that 30 subjects would be required per group in order to detect a difference of 5 days in this parameter with 80% power and 5% probability of type I error. Seventy -five subjects aged 30.67\u00b1 9.91 years were randomized of whom data were analyzed for 30 patients treated with 1% sulfadiazine ( SSD) cream and 30 patients treated wit h the ointment containing Centella asiatica . Burn wounds were treated once daily at home. A ll of the wounds were evaluated till complete healing occurred and at the admission, days 3, 7, 14 objec tive signs; visual acuit y score (VAS) and subjective signs were recorded. Re -epithelialization time and complete healing days were recorded. The mean of complete healing in burning wounds was 14.67 \u00b1 1.78 days in Centella asiatica versus 21.53 \u00b1 1.65 days in SSD group. Starting ti me of complete healing in Centella asiatica group pat ients was on the 10th day, which was the 18th day in SSD group. The average time of re -epithelialization was 6.8 days sooner in Centella asiatica group versus SSD group patients. Multivariate analysis sh owed a significant difference in complete healing between Centella asiatica and SSD groups (P = 0.001). All of the objective indexes, that is, pliability, vascularity, pigmentation, height , and VAS, significantly led to better healing of the burning wound in Centella group rather than SSD group (P < 0.05). All of the subjective indexes, that is, dryness, itching, and irritation, signifi cantly led to bett er healing of the burning wound both in time and efficacy in Centella asiatica group rather than SSD grou p (P < 0.05). Mean of re-epithelialization in burning wounds was 13.7\u00b1 1.48 days in Centella asiatica group versus 20.67\u00b1 2.02 days in SSD group. (Saeidinia et al. 2017). A prospective randomized, double -blind co ntrol study was performed to evaluate the ef ficacy of Centella asiatica cream in 30 patients who underwent a split-thickness skin graft (STSG) operation. The Centella asiatica was prepared by being extracted with 70% alcohol in cream preparation. The Cente lla asiatica extract comprised asiaticoside 5.12% and madecassoside 5.1%. Thai subjects (20 years or older) were divided randomly into 2 groups, with various cream applied to each part of the donor's scar site. One gram of Cream A (7% w/w Centella asiatica extract in cream preparation) or Cream B (placebo) was randomly applied on the subjects at least 2 weeks after epithelialization was completed. The gels were applied for a total treatment period of 12 weeks. A scar assessment using the Vancouver Scar Scal e (VSS) to determine pigmentation, vasc ularity, pliability, and height was taken at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Only 23 of 30 patients completed the study protocol. Two patients were excluded due to rash at the scar, which may have been caused by an allergic respo nse to the products. Five patients were lost to follow -up because they lived far away. For the Centella asiatica cream group, there were differences from baseline including the pigmentation score at 8 and 12 weeks and between 4 and 12 weeks ( - 0.443, p value 0.019; -0.707, p value 0.001; -0.557, p value 0.001) and the overall VSS scores between 4 and 12 weeks ( -1.279, p value 0.041). However, for height, it was worse at 4 weeks (0.300, p value 0.043). For the placebo group, there were 2 differences from the baseline including the pigmentation score b etween 4 and 12 weeks ( -0.399, p value 0.020) and after 12 weeks ( -0.549, p value 0.002), while the pliability and the height scores of both groups were compared before and after treatment and still were not diff erent. (Jenwitheesuk et al. 2018) Clinical s tudies on psoriasis The effects of a topical application of a cream containing the water and oil extract from Centella asiatica were investigated in seven patients affected by psoria sis in a not controlled study. The authors report l esions completely clear ed in five of them, majority of lesions disappeared in one patient, partial but definitive improvement was observed in one case. Preparation: the leaves of the plant were dried and powdered. Dry powder (100 g) wa s put in a flask containing 500 ml of water. Duration of treatment was from 3 to 8 weeks. Patients received no other systemic therapies. There was no evidence of systemic or local toxicity. (Natarajan & Paily 1973). Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 40/68 Clinical studies on anxiety and general anxiety disorder (GAD) The effects of Gotu K ola on the acoustic startle response (ASR) was evaluated in subjects who were randomly assigned to receive either a sing le 12 g orally administered dose of Gotu Kola (N = 20) or placebo (N = 20 ). The ASR paradigm has been extensively used to investigate st ress-related disorders and anxiety in humans. Gotu Kola was administered as crude powder herb blended with grape juice and celery salt in order to make verum and placebo solutions identical in colour, smell and t aste. The authors report that compared with placebo, Gotu Kola signif icantly attenuated the peak ASR amplitude 30 and 60 minutes after treatment. (Bradwejn et al. 2000). The role of 70% hydro -ethanolic extract of dried powdered Centella asiatica (CA) on ge neralized anxiety disorder (GAD) was investi gated in man. Thirty -three Indian participants (18 male and 15 female; average age 33 yrs) were medicated with gelatin capsules containing the CA in a fixed dose regime (500 mg/capsule, twice daily, after meal for 60 days ). Hamilton's Brief Psychiatric Rat ing Scale (BPRS) was used to screen the subjects. The authors report that the results indicate that CA ingestion significantly attenuated stress -anxiety -depression related disorders. The base line score of anxiety index declined to 13.1% in 30 days and 26.0 % in 60 days after the treatment of CA. An improvement (12.5%) in self -perceived stress within 30 days and 23.2% within 60 days were noted. Depression index also reduced from 10.2% (30 days) to 21.8% (60 days) in case of CA trial. After treatment, adjustme nt score finally improved by 35.2% and attention level improved by 27.8%. Each of these results was statistically significant with P-values all <0.01. (Jana et al. 2010) Clinical studies on cognitive function A randomised, placebo -controlled, double -blind study investigated the effect of Centella asiatica on cognitive function of twenty -eight healthy elderly volunteers. Participants received the plant extract (information on extraction method is missing) at variou s doses ranging 250, 500 and 750 mg once daily for 2 months. According to the authors, t he high dose of the plant extract enhanced working memory and increased N100 component amplitude of event -related potential. Improvements of self - rated mood were also f ound following the Centella asiatica treatme nt (Wattanathorn et al. 2008). Farhana et al. (2016) determined the effectiveness of Centella asiatica extract (DER 10:1, extraction solvent ethanol 70%) in improving cognitive function in patients with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). This study used a quasi -experimental design. Subjects in this study were hospitalized Indonesian patients with post -stroke cognitive impairment. Seventeen subjects were treated with 1000 mg/day of Centella asiatica extract, 17 s ubjects treated with 750 mg/day of Centella asiatica extract, and 14 subjects treated with 3 mg/day of folic acid for 6 weeks. According to the authors, a ll treatment groups showed significant improvement in Montreal Cognitive Assessment -Indonesian version (MoCA - Ina) score after six weeks. The mean difference in score of MoCA -Ina at the 6th week minus the baseline for the Centella asiatica 1000 mg group was 5.6 \u00b1 (p<0.001; 95% was 4.06 \u00b1 3.11 (p<0.001; 95% CI). Not one therapy was statistically more effective than the others in increasing MoCA -Ina score (p=0.39). (Farhana et al. 2016) Puttarak et al. (2017) carried out a systematic review and meta -analysis to determi nate the effects of Centella asiatica on cog nitive function and mood related outcomes. Of the 11 included studies, five studies compared Centella asiatica alone to placebo, and six studies compared a combination of Centella asiatica versus other herbs. Nin e studies were conducted using double -blind parallel designs, one used an open -labeled parallel design, and one used a cross -over design. Most studies were conducted in healthy volunteers, while one study was conducted in children with attention deficit hyperactive disorder. In four studies powdered plant was used (part of the plant not specified) whilst in five studies an extract was used , but only in two studies the extraction solvent was reported (standardized water extract of aerial parts). In addition, the doses of Centella asiatica in each stud y Assessment report (L.) Urb ., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 41/68 were different, ranging from 40 -12,000 mg/day. Three of the studies had a high risk of bias, seven studies were unclear, and only one study had a low risk of bias. Although, all studies stated that they were ra ndomized controlled trials, four of the tria ls were found to have unclear risk of bias for \"sequence generation\" because there was no description of the sequence generation methods. Most studies did not describe the \"allocation concealment\" method. In the bias domain of \"blinding\", one study was an open-label study which was categorized as having a high risk of bias. Of the included studies, 60 cognitive function tests were described, but only 27 of the tests had sufficient data for a meta-analysis. The 27 cognitive function tests were each categoriz ed into specific cognitive domains for the purpose of evaluating the cognitive improvement effect of Centella asiatica . The domains included 1) overall cognitive status, 2) attention and concentration, 3) executi ve function, 4) working memory, 5) informati on processing speed, 6) language, 7) verbal memory, 8) visuospatial skill, and 9) visual memory. The meta -analysis indicated no significant difference between Centella asiatica and comparators (placebo) on any co gnitive function domain on a total of 153 su bjects .

Clinical studies in special popula tions (e.g. elderly and children) There are no clinical studies carried out with Centella asiatica alone in special population. 4.4. Overall conclusions on clinical pharmacology an d efficacy Clinical pharmacology on Centella asiatica is not well documented in h umans. Pharmacokinetic data on Centella asiatica herbal substance/preparations are missing. A few clinical studies investigating the effects of Centella asiatica extracts in wound healing have been carried out, but deficiencies in the clinical designs and the lack of sufficient information on the herbal preparations used render the outcomes of these studies not clinically relevant. As a consequence, available data are inadequa te to substantiate a well -established use of Centella asiatica in wound healing. Several clinical studies with herbal preparations of Centella asiatica have been also carried out in different therapeutic areas (i.e. in the treatment of psoriasis, general a nxiety and in the management of skin ageing), but also in these cases the number and the quality of the trials do not provide sufficient clinical relevance to acknowledge a therapeutic indication based on well -established use. A few clinical studies on the the nootropic effect of Centella asiatica have been carried out (Wattanathorn et al. 2008; Farhana et al. 2016). A meta -analysis including 11 clinical studies to determinate the effects of Centella asiatica on cognitive function indicated no s ignificant d ifference between Centella asiatica and comparators (placebo) on any cognitive fu nction domain on a total of 153 subjects , although findings in some trials indicated that Centella asiatica alone may improve working memory. Most of the studies presented m any methodological deficiencies. Finally, full details on the different herbal prep arations used in these studies were often missing and the doses of Centella asiatica were too wide (40-12,000 mg/day). Half of the studied were carried out using Centella asiatica in combination with other treatments. Therefore, there are no grounds to sup port a well - established use of Centella asiatica in improving cognitive function in humans. 5. Clinical Safety/Pharmacovig ilance 5.1. Overview of toxicological/safety data from clinic al trials in humans Although a putative causal effect of adjunctive substances ha s also been discussed, a sensitising effect of the triterpene fraction has been confirmed in animal experiments (Hausen 1993). In a large -scale case study observation, occasio nal burning pain following i.m. injections and the local application of a powder has been reported (Wolfram 1965). Following oral administration of Centella asiatica preparations, gastric complaints and nausea have occasionally been reported, but were not significant versus placebo (Brinkhaus et al. 2000). The efficacy of TTFCA in the treatment of sign and symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency was examined in a systematic review by Chong & Aziz (2012). Eight clinical studies including a total of 522 patients were included. Two trials reported on the adverse effects. In one trial, two patients given Centella asiatica extract experienced minor stomach pain while one patient had to stop treatment due to severe nausea. In the other trial, four patients given TTFCA withdrew from the trial: three due to nausea and gastric pain and one becau se of \"neurological absence.\" The clinical efficacy and side effects of the oral Centella asiatica extract capsule in the diabetic wound healing was studied in a prospective r andomized control study on 200 Thai patients . Patients were treated with 2 capsul es of Centella asiatica extract after meal, three times a day (50 mg of extracted Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 53/68 asiaticoside /capsule in group A ; n = 84 ) or placebo (group B ; n = 86 ). There were no systemi c side effect or complications reported in the clinical study and there was no si gnificant difference of wound infection between two groups; however, the reason why 20 pat ients dropped out was not provi ded. (Paocharoen 2010). There were no adverse reaction s such as severe itching, hypersensitivity, systemic symptoms in the Centella asi atica group (n = 40) during the trial carried out by Saeidinia et al. (2017) in 75 patients with partial thickness burning. A cream containing 7% w/w of an ethanolic extract o f Centella asiatica was administered for 12 weeks in 30 patients who underwent a split-thickness skin graft (STSG) operation. Only 23 of 30 patients completed the study prot ocol. Two patients were excluded due to rash at the scar, which may have been cause d by an allergic response to the products. The allergic reaction occurred with bo th Centella cream and placebo. Five patients were lost to follow -up because they lived far away. No information on the adverse events experienced during the treatment is avail able. (Jenwi theesuk et al. 2018) The role of 70% hydro -ethanolic extract of Cente lla asiatica ((500 mg capsule, twice daily for 60 days) on generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was investigated in 33 patients, but no information was provided on adverse event s. (Jana et al. 2010) Forty-eight subjects with vascular cognitive impairment wer e included in a clinical study aimed to compare the effectiveness of a Centella asiatica extract and folic acid in improving cognitive function. Seventeen subjects we re treate d with 1000 mg/day of G otu kola extract, 17 subje cts treated with 750 mg/day of G otu kola extract, and 14 subjects treated with 3 mg/day of folic acid for 6 weeks. Side effects that arose as a result of a Centella asiatica extract therapy of 1000 mg/day we re constipation and itching (11.11%). The subject who experienced constipation co ntinued with the therapy while the subject who experienced itching discontinued treatment on the 7th day. A side effct that occurred in the Centella asiatica extract group of 750 mg/day was a bloated feeling (5.5%); that subject continued therapy. The adve rse effcts of folic acid therapy at 3 mg/day were nausea and heartburn (14.2%). Two subjects who suffered the condition continued the therapy after getting information and sym ptomatic treatment for their conditions. (Farhana et al. 2016) In the systematic review carried out by Puttarak et al. (2017) five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted to determine the effe ct of Centella asiatica alone and six RCTs conducted de termine the effect o f Centella asiatica -containing products on cognitive function and mood related outcomes. 466 patients were included. No adverse effcts were reported in any studies looking at Centella asiatica alone. However, for studies of combination products, four studies reported mild adverse events of Centella asiatica -containi ng products. Two studies reported adverse event rates comparable to the placebo rate, while another two studies reported lower rates of adverse event for Centella asiatica - containing products. Common adverse events were gastrointestinal discomfort, fltulen ce, nausea, headache, decreased appetite, sedation, and rash. Hepatotoxicity was not observed in any of the included RCTs. None of seven (7) patients with psorias treated with 100 g of dried powdered leaf of Centella asiatica experienced side effect s. (Natarajan & Paily 1973) Lou et al. (2018) examined the effects of CAST, a highly purified, standardized Centella asiatica extract containing triterpenes, on neuropathy symptoms i n Type II diabetic subjects in a 52-week, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial. The triterpene content reported in the certificate of analysis was 37.03% AS, 34.26% MA, and 23.01% AA by weight, which were within the specifications for CAST of 36-44% AS and 56 -64% of combined MA and AA. Forty-three subjects (age 42 -80 year s) with a history of Type II diabetes enrolled in the study. Thirty -three subjects completed the study. Ten dropped out of the study for the following reasons: bladder cancer (1), abnormal liver function (1), Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 54/68 flare-up of a pre -existing skin condition (1), breast tenderness of unknown etiology (1), other unstable medical condition (1), non -compliance (5), and moved out of state (1). Patients were treated either CAST or Placebo f or 52 weeks. CAST was well tolerated up to 240 mg/day for 1 year. Twenty -nine of 43 randomized subjects (67%) experienced at least one adverse event (AE). The proportion of patients who experienced at least one AE in the Placebo (56%) and in the CAST (80%) groups was not significantly different ( p-value= 0.1). However, the odds ratio of having an AE was 3.5 times higher, and the relative risk of an AE was 1.4 times higher for subjects on CAST compared to placebo. AEs included transient abnormal liver and kid ney function or gastrointestinal symptoms, which resolved on their own. Abnormal electrocardiograms (ECGs) were noted in some subjects and were linked to either pre-existing conditions or returned to normal on subsequent tests. All AEs were m inor.

Patient exposure See sections 4.2.2 and 5.1. 5.3. Adverse e vents, serious adverse events and deaths An analysis of reports i n the Thai Health Product Vigilance Ce nter Database from 2000 to 2008 was performed to describe the characteristics of reported adverse events in patients receiving herbal products in Thailan d. Causality assessment was carried out using Naranjo's algorithm by health professionals at the time of report submission. Only reports rated as 'possible' or higher were included in the analysis. Over the 9 -year study period, Thai VigiBase had a total of 593 case reports with 1868 adverse events involving 24 different herbal products. Centella asiatica registered 42 reports (7.1%) for 200 adverse events (10.8%). Most of adverse events were gastrointestinal system disorders (47.5%; n = 95); abdominal pian, flatulence, constipation, dry mouth, nausea and vomiting were th e most frequent gastrointestinal adverse events (n 10). Anorexia (n =21), dizziness (n =13) and palpitations (n = 12) were other frequent observed adverse events. One case of serious exfoli ative dermatitis was experienced. (Saokaew et al. 2011) Allergic contact dermatitis has been reported after the topical application of various creams and ointments containing Centella extracts ( Izu et al. 1992, D anese et al. 1994 ). However, further testing revealed that reactions may be due to other ingredients in the p reparations (Hausen BM. Centella asiatica Indian pennywort) . with ointment containing Centella asiatica purified branded material (Madecassol\u00ae) has been r eported by Gomes et al. (2010). A 42 -year-old non -atopic woman wit h no relevant past history presented with localized, severe eczema on her neck and upper chest, after treating a hypertrophic thyroidectomy scar with the mentioned ointment. She required sys temic corticosteroid therapy while, o ne month later, patch tests w ere performed with the ointment (tested 'as is') and its ingredients. Positive reactions to the ointment itself as well as to Centella asiatica extract (1% and 5% pet.) and weak reactions (p robably of irritant nature) to lavender oil (20% pet.) and propyle ne glycol (5% pet.) were obtained. Patch tests with Centella asiatica extract 1% and 5% in 20 controls were negative. In a mu lticentric Italian study to assess use and skin reactions to topi cal botanically derived products and usefulness of patch tests , 122 patients who reported cutaneous adverse reactions after botanical products application, underwent patch testing with a series of botanical preparations including Centella asiatica extract 2% in ethanol. Three patients (2.5%) had positive reactions to thi s extract. (Corazza et al. 2013). Following oral administration of Centella asiatica preparations, gastric complaints and nausea have occasionally been reported, but they were not significan t versus placebo (Kartnig and Hoffmann -Bohm, 1992). Pain and burni ng sensation, following intramuscular injection or the topical application of preparations available as powders, and allergic contact dermatitis have been reported (Allegra et al. 1981; Mara stoni et al. 1982; Pointel et al. 1987). Adverse reaction from Greece: During the oral use rarely mild gastrointestinal pain (nausea, vomit etc.) Gotu Kola has been reported to cause hyperglycaemia and hypercholesterolemia in a single trial since 1969 (Rot blatt & Ziment 2001). Three women (61, 52 and 49 years old) developed jaundice after taking orally Centella asiatica for 30, 20 and 60 days. Respective ALT: 1193, 1694 4.23, The ASMA ( Anti-Smooth Muscle Antibody) 1/160 and AMA (Antimitochondrial Antibody) The respective pathological diagnoses Assessment report Urb., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 64/68 were: granulomatous with marked necrosis and apoptosis; chronic hepatitis with cirrhotic transformation and intense necroinflamma tory activity, and granulomatous hepatitis. All the three patients improved with Centella asiatica discontinuation, and ursodeoxycholic acid 10 mg/kg/day. The first patient took Centella asiatica again, with recurre nce of the damage. The second one had tak en this herb a year before. It was hypothesised that terpenic active principles of Centella can produce hepatic injury by promoting apoptosis and altering cell membranes. The presence of autoantibodies and granuloma s also favours an immune -mediated mechani sm (Jorge & Jorge 2005). A case report of hepatotoxicity involved 15 -year-old girl who presented with a short history of abdominal pain and vomiting. She had been on lymecycline, for acne, over the preceding 8 weeks . Investigations revealed deranged liver function as follows \u2014Serum bilirubin 31 \u00b5mol/L, ALT 319 IU/L, GGT 39 35 g/L. ALT rapidly rose to 3222 IU/L within 24 h. Prothrombin time increased to 31 s and an INR was 2.7. She was treated with N -acetyl cysteine at a dose of 100 mg/kg/24 h as a continuous intravenous infusion that was stopped after 54 h. Intravenous Vitamin K at a dose of 10 mg once daily was given for 4 consecutive days. Her liver function tests and coagulation profile improved rap idly. Investigations showed normal immuno globulin, caeruloplasmin and alpha -1-antitrypsin levels, and negative autoantibody and urine metabolic screens. Serology for Hepatitis A, B, virus, Mycoplasma a nd Epstein was negative. Ultra sound revealed a mildly echogenic liver. Further enquiry revealed that she had been on herbal medication ( 20 mg/day, active ingredient Gotu Kola) for acne that was bought over the Internet, over the preceding six we eks. Both lymecycline and the herbal medi cation were stopped. Tetracyclines are known to cause acute hepatitis and/or cholestasis, but usually within 4-6 days of starting the medication. A temporal association of herbal medication induced acute hepatitis w ith immediate improvement after cessation of medication was seen in this child. It was considered unlikely that lymecycline could have contributed to the liver injury due to the time frames involved and absence of cholestasis.

Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 65/68 Thirty (30) patients with diabetic microangiopathy were treated for 6 months with total triterpenic fraction of Centella asiatica (TTFCA) (60 mg twice daily ), whilst a control group of ten patients was treated with placebo and another group of ten patients was left without treatment thus acting as a second control group. Fasting blood sugar levels were similar in the three groups at the beginning of the study . No significant variation of fasting blood sugar levels or glycosylated hemoglobin levels were observed during or after the study in the group treated with TTFCA or the control group. Blood tests indicating renal and hepatic functions and routine blood te sts did not show any significant change after 3 and 6 months of treatment. (Cesarone et al. 2001) Seventeen subjects we re treated with 1000 mg/day of Centella asiatica extract, 17 subje cts treated with 750 mg/day of G otu kola extract, and 14 subjects treat ed with 3 mg/day of folic acid for 6 weeks to det ermine the effectiveness of Centella asiatica in improving cognitive function in patients with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). In all groups no significant differences were found in the levels of AST an d ALT after the 6 -week treatment period when comp ared with baseline levels of AST and ALT. The between -group analysis also did not show difference in AST and ALT changes among the three treatment groups. (Farhana et al. 2016) 5.5.

Centella asiatica should be avoided during pregnancy, due to its emmenagogue action (Alternative Medicine Review 2007). Not be used during pre gnancy without medical advice (ESCOP 2009). There is no clinical evidence from literature on the antifertility effects of Centella asiatica in humans. For cutaneous use , safety during pregnancy and lactation has not been established. In the absence of sufficient data, the use during pregnancy and lactatio n is not recommended. No fertility data available on topical application of Centella asiatica . Assessment report 66/68 5.5.6.

Overall conclusions on clinical safety Overall, different herbal preparation s of Centella a siatica alone or in c ombination with other herbs have been well tolerated in clinical studies, alt hough no specific clinical safety studies have bee n carr ied out. Gastrointestinal system disorders including abdominal pain, flatulence, nausea, and vomiting were the most frequent adverse events mainly associated to oral use experienced during clinical t rials and recorded from post -marketing surveillanc e. Topical application of Centella asiatica can result in allergic reactions although frequency cannot be established. Allergic contact dermatitis has been associated with topical application of Centella asiatica . However, these reactions may be due to oth er ingredients in the products . Hypersensitivity to plants of Apiaceae (Umbeliferae) family is monographs (ESCOP 2009 , There no clinical ev idence from literature on the antifertility effect s of Centella asiatica in humans. However, it has been used in folk medicine for dysmenorrhoea (WHO monograph 1999) and is reputed to be abortifacient and to modify the menstrual cycle (Barnes et al. 2007) . In addition, there is non - clinical evidence that ethanolic extracts of Centella asiatica could significantly impair fertility in rats also at HED lower than those traditionally used in humans topically for wound healing and orally for rheumatoid arthritis and cutaneous affections, based on B ritish Pharma copoeia. Signs of hepatotoxicity were seen in a non -clinical study on rats treated with oral HED of 4 g of dried, powdered aerial parts of Centella asiatica , whilst no evidence of hepatotoxicity could be dr awn from clinical studies in humans. However, ther e are several case reports of hepatotoxicity cited in literature with the assumption of oral Centella asiatica preparations, but without a conclusive casual relationship. Moderate renal toxicity was also ob served in non -clinical studies on rats treated wit h oral HED of 4 g of dried, powdered aerial parts of Centella asiatica , but this evidence was not confirmed in humans. In conclusion , oral use of Centella asiatica has not been reported in the HMPC monograp h due to concerns on potential a nti-fertility and hepatotoxic effects in humans, taking also into account that there are other effective and safe therapeutic options available. Both anti -fertility and hepatotoxic effects are not expected following topical application of Centella asiatica as an aid to heal ing of minor wounds based on clinical data available. Assessment report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 67/68 6. Overall conclusions (benefit -risk assessment) Centella asiatica , also known as \"Gotu kola\" or \" Hydrocotile asiatica \", is a member of the Apiaceae family and it has been described since ancient times as having beneficial medicinal effects. The plant parts used for medicinal use are the dried leaves, aerial parts or the whole plant. There are no marketed herbal medicinal products containing herbal preparat ions of Centella asiatica alone in EU, but British Pharmacopoeia (1989) reports the use of the herb for the treatment of rheumatic conditions, cutaneous affections , and topically, for the healing of indolent wounds. The posology indicated was 0.6 g of dried herb or as infusion thrice daily. Reproductive toxicity studies showed that ethanolic extracts of Centella asiatica had a detrimental effect on fertility of male and female rats treated with oral doses at HED doses even lower than 0.6 - 1.8 g reported i n the monograph. Signs of severe hepatotoxicity a nd moderate nephrotoxicity were also observed in rats treated with 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg (corresponding to a HED of 4 g and 8 g, respectively) due to a decrease of viable cell counts and histopthological evidence of liver damage and change of renal tiss ue. Clinical case reports of hepatotoxic ity following oral assumption o f Centella asiatica have been reported in literature. Therefore , the outcomes of above mentioned evidences raise concerns on the safe u se of Centella asiatica when taken orally for the treatment of articular pain; as a conseguence , this indication has been excluded from the monograph considering that other effective and safe therapeutic options (including other herbal preparations) are av ailable. Different ly for oral route, topical appl ication of Centella asiatica herb can be regarded reasonably safe. Indeed, there are some shortcomings in the reproductive t oxicity studies that limit the extrapolability of the results observed to humans, such as the limited number of rats for treatment/c ontrol groups and the lack of investigation of the potential for reversibility of the effect. In addition, these studies have been carried out using an ethanolic extract which is an herbal preparation not i ncluded in the monograph. Furthermore, hepatoto city and nephro toxicity are expected to be associated with the oral use of Centella asiatica rather than with cutaneous use. In summary, based on BHP, there is evidence of traditional use according to the requ irements set out by art. 16a of the Directive 2001 /83/EC for comminuted or powdered Centella asiatica herb to aid in healing of minor wounds when topically applied on the affected area of the skin at doses of 0.6 g three times a day as a cutaneous powder or as an infusion preparation for cutaneous use (impregnated dressing) . Pre-clinical studies with Centella asiatica in wound healing support the plausibility of efficacy based on tradition . Clinical studies showed a trend effect of cutaneous applications o f Centella asiatica in wound healing but the small sample size, some methodological deficiencies and the lack of full details on the herbal preparations used do not provide sufficient proof of well -established use. Clinical studies with Centella asiatica have been carried out to treat different condition s, such as psoriasis, skin ageing, and anxiety disorders and to improve cognitive function but there are too many methodological issues to support a well -established use. A duration of use of 1 week is esta blished to be in agreement with the HMPC monograph s of other plants used topically in wound healing. Centella asiatica should not be topical ly applied in case of known hypersensitivity to the active substance and to other plants of the Apiaceae (Umbelifera e) family. Assessm ent report on Centella asiatica (L.) Urb., herba EMA/HMPC/489140/2020 Page 68/68 The use in children and adolescents und er 18 years of age is not recommended due to the lack of data. Due to the absence of sufficient data, (the antiabortifac ient properties and the emmenag ogue effect reported in literature ), the use of Centell a asiatica during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended. Centella asiatica water extract was not mutagenic in an Ames test (pre -incubation method) up to 5 mg/plate; only strains TA98 and TA100 were assayed and no information on positive control was provided, therefore further studies are needed to co nfirm the absence of mutagenicity. A European Union list entry is not supported due to lack of adequate data on genotoxicity. Annex 1 List of references "}
