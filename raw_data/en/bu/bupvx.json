See why you should add glutathione-containing foods to your diet! Aging is a natural process, and it's important to embrace aging and the beauty of it. While we embrace our natural lifecycles and our growth, it's important to realize that the lifestyles we lead nowadays\u2014packed with long work hours, long commute, high stress levels, bad eating habits, and more\u2014will escalate the aging process. Meaning? You may be thirty years old but your body forty-five. Shocking? It's true! Aging is nothing but oxidization. Oxidization leads to the buildup of free radicals in your body, which in turn leads to aging, bone degeneration, and other health issues. We can't prevent aging altogether, but we can prevent the escalation of aging. One of the most powerful ingredients known to slow aging and act as an anti-oxidation tool is glutathione. What is Glutathione? Glutathione is a tripeptide naturally produced by our bodies. It's created by the combination of glutamic acid, L-cysteine, and L-glycine. It's known to slow down oxidization and prevent your body cells from aging and degenerating quickly. Benefits: - It helps prevent cellular oxidation, fast aging, poor skin, cancer cell growth, and more. - Glutathione works at an intercellular level, thereby preventing the depletion of other antioxidants. It helps recycle and replicate the antioxidant power. - Being a protein, glutathione helps the liver function. It prevents liver failure by supporting the detoxification process and assisting the liver in producing bile and eliminating toxins smoothly. - It reduces inflammation and infection and keeps your body healthy at a cellular level. Consuming Glutathione Even though glutathione is produced by the human body naturally, our lifestyles deplete our glutathione reserves. The best way to increase glutathione production is by consuming N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), which increases levels naturally. The best way to get glutathione directly is through intravenous injection. According to research, no glutathione supplements work. Apart from this, there are foods that help with glutathione production: - Avocado and walnuts - Cruciferous vegetables - Onions and garlic - Leafy greens According to Dr. Terry Wahls, \"Being diagnosed by MS , I decided to treat the disease aggressively. After taking up chemotherapy and taking up a wheel chair, my health continued to decline. When I hit the wheel chair, I realized that conventional medicine would not cure this. Soon, I switched to eating fresh fruits and vegetables that completely changed everything. Within 12 months, I was completely transformed.\" She talks about the Wahls protocol \"which removes three foods that cause auto-immune disease, which is gluten, casein and protein in egg whites. After this elimination, vegetable intake is ramped up and glutathione production is increased.\" You can read more about Dr.Wahls protocol [here.](http://www.penguin.com/ajax/books/excerpt/9781583335215) Eat natural.
