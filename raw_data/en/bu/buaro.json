Good Question: It all comes down to a very specific part of an allergen called an epitope CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - Earlier this week, we told you about a discovery that could lead scientists to a vaccine that would [cure people of their dog allergies](https://www.wbtv.com/2022/01/04/researchers-moving-toward-creating-vaccine-end-allergies/). It all comes down to a very specific part of an allergen called an epitope. It's basically what causes your immune system to react to an allergen. Every allergen type has a different epitope, so scientists are closing in on the specific epitope that makes most people allergic to dogs. Becky writes: \"I have a question about the epitope vaccine you mentioned for dog allergies. What about cat allergies?\" Good question. Chances are, a different vaccine would need to be developed for cat allergies. That's because common cat allergens would have a different epitope than common dog allergens. However, the thinking is that once scientists figure out how to create a vaccine with that dog allergen epitope, they can create vaccines for other allergies using the same system. So, that dog allergy vaccine wouldn't work for cat allergies, but a cat allergy vaccine could be created using the same thinking. Copyright 2022 WBTV. All rights reserved. "}
