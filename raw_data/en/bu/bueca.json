It was as though a door opened and brilliant light flooded around me. I soon recognized that Rudolf Steiner was my teacher and that Anthroposophy would be my guide and path through life.\" \"I felt starved at university, and the Society activities provided much-needed nourishment.\" \"It's right for me to help keep anthroposophy alive!\" \"I became a member as a free gesture to uphold and support the spiritual work of Anthroposophy. I was an eurythmy student in England, and felt inspired by the older generation, John Davy, who had just passed away and Eileen Hutchins and others and wanted to be part of this community too!\" \"I joined the Anthroposophical Society, first in the UK , when I was a student at Emerson College.

To support (financially) the Canadian scene and also worldwide.\" \"I began studying Steiner a few years ago.
