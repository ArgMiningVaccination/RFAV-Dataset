Is that true? If not, what constitutes an appropriate chiropractic manipulation? Answer The standard method of spinal manipulation consists of using the hands to loosen, stretch, or mobilize muscles and joints in areas of the back and spine. This is an appropriate method used by chiropractors, osteopaths, physiatrists, physical therapists, and other practitioners who use manual therapy. Practitioners who use manipulation appropriately use similar hands-on techniques in the involved areas to treat mechanical problems. Chiropractors who \"adjust\" the spine to remove what they call \"nerve interference\" caused by \"subluxations,\" may use a great variety of techniques, some of which do not involve hands-on manipulation.

Answer The standard method of spinal manipulation consists of using the hands to loosen, stretch, or mobilize muscles and joints in areas of the back and spine. This is an appropriate method used by chiropractors, osteopaths, physiatrists, physical therapists, and other practitioners who use manual therapy. Practitioners who use manipulation appropriately use similar hands-on techniques in the involved areas to treat mechanical problems. Chiropractors who \"adjust\" the spine to remove what they call \"nerve interference\" caused by \"subluxations,\" may use a great variety of techniques, some of which do not involve hands-on manipulation. For example: - \"Activator Technique\" utilizes a spring-loaded to tap \"subluxated vertebrae\" back into alignment. - Cranial therapists claim that the bones of the skull can misalign and cause problems by blocking the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. - Some chiropractors adjust only the upper cervical spine, where they feel that most \"nerve interference\" occurs. - Some chiropractors use the \"Meric System,\" which involves adjusting specific vertebra for each ailment. - And so on. Chiropractors who adjust the spine to correct \"subluxations\" to remove \"nerve interference\" that they believe is causing a health problem base their treatment on an implausible theory that integrates implausible diagnostic methods such as muscle-testing (Applied Kinesiology) or Contact Reflex Analysis to locate alleged \"subluxations.\" The diagnosis and treatment of nonexistent lesions is closely associated with unethical entrepreneurial practices. The bottom line is that I personally recommend hands-on spinal manipulation for treating carefully-selected mechanical-type back and neck problems. I do not recommend any technique said to restore or maintain health by adjusting \"subluxations\" to remove \"nerve interference.\" ____________________ Dr. Homola is a second-generation chiropractor who has dedicated himself to defining the proper limits on chiropractic and to educating consumers and professionals about the field.

[Hide Full Content](#three-thousand-nine-hundred-eighty-five) [Flexner's View of Homeopathic Schools: An Excerpt from the Flexner Report (1910)](https://quackwatch.org/homeopathy/history/flexner/) The proposition raises at once the question as to whether in this era of scientific medicine, sectarian medicine is logically defensible; as to whether, while it exists, separate standards, fixed by the conditions under which it can survive, are justifiable. Prior to the placing of medicine on a scientific basis, sectarianism was, of course, inevitable. Every one started with some sort of preconceived notion; and from a logical point of view, one preconception is as good as another. Allopathy was just as sectarian as homeopathy. Indeed, homeopathy was the inevitable retort to allopathy. If one man \"believes\" in dissimilars, contrary suggestion is certain to provide another who will stake his life on similars; the champion of big doses will be confronted by the champion of ... The proposition raises at once the question as to whether in this era of scientific medicine, sectarian medicine is logically defensible; as to whether, while it exists, separate standards, fixed by the conditions under which it can survive, are justifiable. Prior to the placing of medicine on a scientific basis, sectarianism was, of course, inevitable. Every one started with some sort of preconceived notion; and from a logical point of view, one preconception is as good as another. Allopathy was just as sectarian as homeopathy. Indeed, homeopathy was the inevitable retort to allopathy. If one man \"believes\" in dissimilars, contrary suggestion is certain to provide another who will stake his life on similars; the champion of big doses will be confronted by the champion of little ones. But now that allopathy has surrendered to modern medicine, is not homeopathy borne on the same current into the same harbor? The modern point of view may be restated as follows: medicine is a discipline, in which the effort is made to use knowledge procured in various ways in order to effect certain practical ends. With abstract general propositions it has nothing to do. It harbors no preconceptions as to diseases or their cure. Instead of starting with a finished and supposedly adequate dogma or principle, it has progressively become less cocksure and more modest. It distrusts general propositions, a priori explanations, grandiose and comforting generalizations. It needs theories only as convenient summaries in which a number of ascertained facts may be used tentatively to define a course of action. It makes no effort to use its discoveries to substantiate a principle formulated before the facts were even suspected. For it has learned from the previous history of human thought that men possessed of vague preconceived ideas are strongly disposed to force facts to fit, defend, or explain them. And this tendency both interferes with the free search for truth and limits the good which can be extracted from such truth as is in its despite attained. Modern medicine has therefore as little sympathy for allopathy as for homeopathy. It simply denies outright the relevancy or value of either doctrine. It wants not dogma, but facts. It countenances no presupposition that is not common to it with all the natural sciences, with all logical thinking. The sectarian, on the other hand, begins with his mind made up. He possesses in advance a general formula, which the particular instance is going to illustrate, verify, reaffirm, even though he may not know just how. One may be sure that facts so read will make good what is expected of them; that only that will be seen which will sustain its expected function; that every aspect noted will be dutifully loyal to the revelation in whose favor the observer is predisposed: the human mind is so constituted. It is precisely the function of scientific method\u2014in social life, politics, engineering, medicine\u2014to get rid of such hindrances to clear thought and effective action. For it, comprehensive summaries are situate in the future, not in the past; we shall attain them, if at all, at the end of great travail; they are not lightly to be assumed prior to the beginning. Science believes slowly; in the absence of crucial demonstration its mien is humble, its hold is light. \"One should not teach dogmas; on the contrary, every utterance must be put to the proof. One should not train disciples but form observers: one must teach and work in the spirit of natural science.\" [Johannes Orth: BerZiwr Kimiscfus Wochenschrift, vol. xliii. p. 818] Scientific medicine therefore brushes aside all historic dogma. It gets down to details immediately. No man is asked in whose name he comes\u2014whether that of Hahnemann, Rush, or of some more recent prophet. But all are required to undergo rigorous cross-examination. Whatsoever makes good is accepted, becomes in so far part, and organic part, of the permanent structure. To plead in advance a principle couched in pseudo-scientific language or of extra-scientific character is to violate scientific quality. There is no need, just as there is no logical justification, for the invocation of names or creeds, for the segregation from the larger body of established truth of any particular set of truths or supposed truths as especially precious. Such segregation may easily invest error with the sanctity of truth; it will certainly result in conferring disproportionate importance upon the fact or procedure marked out as of pivotal significance. The tendency to build a system out of a few partially apprehended facts, deductive inference filling in the rest, has not indeed been limited to medicine, but it has nowhere had more calamitous consequences. The logical position of medical sectarians today is self-contradictory. They have practically accepted the curriculum as it has been worked out on the scientific basis. They teach pathology, bacteriology, clinical microscopy. They are thereby committed to the scientific method; for they aim to train the student to ascertain and interpret facts in the accepted scientific manner. He may even learn his sciences in the same laboratory as the non-sectarian. But scientific method cannot be limited to the first half of medical education. The same method, the same attitude of mind, must consistently permeate the entire process. The sectarian therefore in effect contradicts himself when, having pursued or having agreed to pursue the normal scientific curriculum with his student for two years, he at the beginning of the third year produces a novel principle and requires that thenceforth the student effect a compromise between science and revelation. Once granted the possibility of medical dogma, there can be no limit to the number of dissenting sects. As a matter of fact, only three or four are entitled to serious notice in an educational discussion. The chiropractics, the mechano-therapists, and several others are not medical sectarians, though exceedingly desirous of masquerading as such; they are unconscionable quacks, whose printed advertisements are tissues of exaggeration, pretense, and misrepresentation of the most unqualifiedly mercenary character. The public prosecutor and the grand jury are the proper agencies for dealing with them. Sectarians, in the logical sense above discussed, are (1) the homeopathists, (2) the eclectics, (3) the physiomedicals, (4) the osteopaths. All of them accept in theory, at least, the same fundamental basis. They admit that anatomy, pathology, bacteriology, physiology, must form the foundation of a medical education, to use the words broadly so as to include all varieties of therapeutic procedure. They offer no alternative to pathology or physiology; there is, they concede, only one proper science of the structure of the human body, of the abnormal growths that afflict it. So far, they make no issue as against scientific medicine. Much is involved in agreement up to this point. The standards of admission to the medical school, the facilities which the schools must furnish in order effectively to teach the fundamental branches, are the same for all alike. A student of homeopathy or of osteopathy needs to be just as intelligent and mature as a student of scientific medicine; and he is no easier to teach; for during the first and second years, at least, he is supposed to be doing precisely the same things. At the beginning of the clinical years, the sectarian interposes his special principle. But educationally, the conditions he needs thenceforth do not materially differ from those needed by consistently scientific medicine. Once more, whatever the arbitrary peculiarity of the treatment to be followed, the student cannot be trained to recognize clinical conditions, to distinguish between different clinical conditions, or to follow out a line of treatment, except in the ways previously described in dealing with scientific medicine. He must see patients and must follow their progress, so as to discover what results take place in consequence of the specific measures employed. A sectarian institution, being a school in which students are trained to do particular things, needs the same resources and facilities on the clinical side as a school of scientific medicine. Sectarian institutions do not exist in Canada; in the United States there are 32 of them, of which 15 are homeopathic, 8 eclectic, 1 physiomedical, and 8 osteopathic. Without attempting to indicate the peculiar tenets of each, we shall briefly review them as schools, seeking to ascertain how far they are in position effectively to teach, quite regardless of the individual doctrine each sect may desire to promote. None of the fifteen homeopathic schools [Hahnemann (San Francisco), Hahnemann and Hering (Chicago), state universities of Iowa and Michigan, Southwestern Homeopathic (Louisville), Boston University, Detroit Homeopathic, Kansas City (Kansas) Hahnemann, New York Medical College for Women, New York Homeopathic, Pulte (Cincinnati),Cleveland Homeopathic, Hahnemann (Philadelphia), Atlantic Medical (Baltimore)] requires more than a high school education for entrance; only five require so much. [State universities of Iowa and Michigan, Detroit Homeopathic, and the two New York schools.] The remaining eleven get less,\u2014how much less depending on their geographical locations rather than on the school's own definition. The Louisville, Kansas City, and Baltimore schools cannot be said to have admission standards in any strict sense at all; Pulte at Cincinnati is bound to be careful in dealing with Ohio candidates: outsiders are responsible for themselves. The minimum at Boston University, to judge from the examinations which, in default of acceptable credentials, the candidate must pass, covers less than two years of a good high school course. On the laboratory side, though the homeopaths admit the soundness of the scientific position, they have taken no active part in its development. Nowhere in homeopathic institutions, with the exception of one or two departments at Boston University, is there any evidence of progressive scientific work. Even \"drug proving\" is rarely witnessed. The fundamental assumption of the sect is sacred; and scientific activity cannot proceed where any such interdict is responsible for the spirit of the institution. The homeopathic departments at Iowa and Michigan are in this respect only half-schools,\u2014clinical halves. For their students get their scientific instruction in pathology, anatomy, etc., in the only laboratories which the university devotes to those subjects, under men none of whom sympathizes with homeopathy. Their disadvantage is increased by the fact that the instruction is adapted to students who have had one or two years of college work. The general argument in favor of higher standards is here reinforced by the consideration that the homeopathic students should certainly qualify themselves for the only grade of scientific instruction that the two universities offer. Of complete homeopathic schools, Boston University, the New York Homeopathic College, and the Hahnemann of Philadelphia alone possess the equipment necessary for the effective routine teaching of the fundamental branches. None of them can employ full-time teachers to any considerable extent. But they possess fairly well-equipped laboratories in anatomy, pathology, bacteriology, and physiology [The Philadelphia Hahnemann is defective in experimental physiology.], a museum showing care and intelligence, and a decent library. Boston University deserves especial commendation for what it has accomplished With its small annual income. Of the remaining homeopathic schools, four are weak and uneven: the Hahnemann of San Francisco and the Hahnemann of Chicago have small, but not altogether inadequate, equipment for the teaching of chemistry, elementary pathology and bacteriology ;the Cleveland school offers an active course in experimental physiology. Beyond ordinary dissection and elementary chemistry, they offer little else. There is, for example, no experimental physiology in the San Francisco Hahnemann: \"the instructor doesn't believe in it;\" the Chicago Hahnemann contains a small outfit and a few animals for that subject; the Cleveland equipment for pathology and bacteriology is meager. The New York Homeopathic College for Women is well intentioned, but its means have permitted it to do but little in any direction. Six schools remain\u2014all utterly hopeless: Hering (Chicago), because it is without plant or resources; the other five [Southwestern (Louisville), Pulte (Cincinnati), Atlantic (Baltimore), and the Detroit and Kansas City schools], because in addition to having nothing, their condition indicates the total unfitness of their managers for any sort of educational responsibility. The buildings are filthy and neglected. At Louisville no branch is properly equipped; in one room, the outfit is limited to a dirty and tattered manikin; in another, a single guinea pig awaits his fate in a cage. At Detroit the dean and secretary \"have their offices downtown;\" the so-called laboratories are in utter confusion. At Kansas City similar disorder prevails. At the Atlantic Medical appearances are equally bad; to make matters worse, the school has lately omitted the word \"homeopathic\" from its title so as to gather in students dropped from other Baltimore schools. In respect to hospital facilities, the University of Michigan, Boston University, and the New York Homeopathic alone command an adequate supply of material, under proper control, though modern teaching methods are not thoroughly utilized even by them. The Iowa school controls a small, but inadequate, hospital. All the others are seriously handicapped by either lack of material or lack of control and in most instances by both. The Hahnemann of San Francisco relies mainly on 30 beds supported by the city and county in a private hospital; the Detroit school is cordially welcome at the Grace Hospital, but less than 60 beds are available, and they are mostly surgical; the Woman's Homeopathic of New York controls a hospital of 35 available beds, mostly surgical [This school has scattered supplementary facilities, as is the way of New York schools.]; the Southwestern (Louisville) and the Cleveland school get one-fifth of the patients that enter the city hospitals of their respective towns, but these hospitals are not equipped or organized with a view to teaching. The Kansas City school holds clinics one day a week at the City Hospital; Pulte (Cincinnati) and the Atlantic (Baltimore) have, as nearly as one can gather, nothing definite at all. Several of the schools appear to be unnecessarily handicapped. The Chicago Hahnemann adjoins a hospital with 60 ward beds. But as the superintendent \"doesn't believe in admitting students to wards,\" there is little or nothing beyond amphitheater teaching. A bridge connects Hering (Chicago) with a homeopathic hospital, but \"students are not admitted.\" The Cleveland school is next door to a hospital with which it was once intimate; their relations have been ruptured. An excellent hospital is connected with the building occupied by the Philadelphia Hahnemann, but there is no ward work. The dispensary situation is rather worse. Iowa and Ann Arbor have little opportunity. Of the others, Boston University alone has a really model dispensary, comparing favorably in equipment, organization, and conduct with the best institutions of the kind in the country. The New York Homeopathic, the Chicago Hahnemann, and the Philadelphia Hahnemann command material enough. The others lack material, equipment, or care; in some instances,\u2014Atlantic Medical, Pulte, Detroit, Kansas City,\u2014they lack everything that a dispensary should possess. Financially, the two state university departments and the New York Homeopathic school are the only homeopathic schools whose strength is greater than their fee income. All the others are dependent on tuition. Their outlook for higher entrance standards or improved teaching is, therefore, distinctly unpromising. Only a few of them command tuition fees enough to do anything at all: the Chicago Hahnemann, Boston University, and the Philadelphia Hahnemann, with annual fees ranging between $12,000 and $18,000. Nine of them are hopelessly poor: the San Francisco Hahnemann, Hering (Chicago), the Detroit Homeopathic, and the Atlantic Medical operate on less than $4000 a year; the Southwestern (Louisville) and Pulte (Cincinnati) on less than $1500. [Estimated] In the year 1900 there were twenty-two homeopathic colleges in the United States; to-day there are fifteen; the total student enrolment has within the same period been cut almost in half, decreasing from 1909 to 1009; the graduating classes have fallen from 418 to 249. [Journal of the American Institute of Homeopathy, vol. i , no. 11, p. 537. The Journal of the American Medical Association, Aug. 14. 1909 (p. 556,557), somewhat lower: 889 instead of 1009; 209 instead of 246. The discrepancy does not alter our interpretation.] As the country is still poorly supplied with homeopathic physicians, these figures are ominous; for the rise of legal standard must inevitably affect homeopathic practitioners. In the financial weakness of their schools, the further shrinkage of the student body will inhibit first the expansion, then the keeping up, of the sect. Logically, no other outcome is possible. The ebbing vitality of homeopathic schools is a striking demonstration of the incompatibility of science and dogma. One may begin with science and work through the entire medical curriculum consistently, exposing everything to the same sort of test; or one may begin with a dogmatic assertion and resolutely refuse to entertain anything at variance with it. But one cannot do both. One cannot simultaneously assert science and dogma; one cannot travel half the road under the former banner, in the hope of taking up the latter, too, at the middle of the march. Science, once embraced, will conquer the whole. Homeopathy has two options: one to withdraw into the isolation in which alone any peculiar tenet can maintain itself; the other to put that tenet into the melting-pot. Historically it undoubtedly played an important part in discrediting empirical allopathy. But laboratories of physiology and pharmacology are now doing that work far more effectively than homeopathy; and they are at the same time performing a constructive task for which homeopathy, as such, is unfitted. It will be clear, then, why, when outlining a system of schools for the training of physicians on scientific lines, no specific provision is made for homeopathy. For everything of proved value in homeopathy belongs of right to scientific medicine and is at this moment incorporate in it; nothing else has any footing at all, whether it be of allopathic or homeopathic lineage. \"A new school of practitioners has arisen,'\" says Dr. Osler, \"which cares nothing for homeopathy and less for so-called allopathy. It seeks to study, rationally and scientifically, the action of drugs, old and new.\" [Loc. cit ., p. 268] * * * * * In dealing with the medical sectary, society can employ no special device. Certain profound characteristics in one way or another support the medical dissenter: now, the primitive belief in magic crops up in his credulous respect for an impotent drug; again, all other procedure having failed, what is there to lose by flinging one's self upon the mercy of chance? Instincts so profound cannot be abolished by statute. But the limits within which they can play may be so regulated as to forbid alike their commercial and their crudely ignorant exploitation. The law may require that all practitioners of the healing art comply with a rigidly enforced preliminary educational standard; that every school possess the requisite facilities; that every licensed physician demonstrate a practical knowledge of the body and its affections. To these terms no reasonable person can object; the good sense of society can enforce them upon reasonable and unreasonable alike. From medical sects that can live on these conditions, the public will suffer little more harm than it is destined to suffer anyhow from the necessary incompleteness of human knowledge and the necessary defects of human skill.

United States District Court DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND |In the Matter of the Seizure of | Bank Account Number 1452-751-0 Citizens Bank of Rhode Island c/o Legal Department 100 Sockonosset Road Cranston, RI |APPLICATION AND AFFIDAVIT | FOR SEIZURE WARRANTCASE NUMBER: 1:05-M-04M I, Jason A. Simonian, being first duly sworn, depose and state as follows: I. Introduction 1. I am a Special Agent with the United States Food and Drug Administration, Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA/OCI), and have been so employed since September of 1997. I am assigned to the Boston, Massachusetts Resident Office. Prior to my employment with FDA, I conducted criminal investigations as a Special Agent with the U.S. Department of Labor for eight (8) years. I have attended numerous federal agency sponsored training courses and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. I am responsible for conducting criminal investigations involving violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and other federal statutes enforced by FDA. 2. This affidavit is submitted in support of a search warrant for The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing, which operates at the address of One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island. 3. This affidavit is also submitted in support of a seizure warrant for Citizens Bank Account No. 1452-751-0. The account constitutes evidence of the commission of a criminal offense, or constitutes contraband, fruits of crime, or things otherwise criminally possessed within the meaning of Fed.R. Crm. P. 41(b), and is subject to forfeiture pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7981(a)(l)(A) and, therefore, may also be seized pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7981(b). 4. As part of my duties as a Special Agent with FDA/OCI, I am currently investigating allegations of the following illegal activity: (1) Mail Fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71341, which makes it a federal crime for a person, having devised or intended to devise a scheme to defraud or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, for the purpose of executing such scheme, to place or cause to be placed in any post office or authorized depository for mail or to take or receive there from any matter or thing; and, (2) Wire Fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71343, which makes it a federal crime for a person, having devised or intended to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or to obtain money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, to transmit or cause to be transmitted by wire, radio or telephone communications in interstate commerce any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice. 5. In addition, I am investigating allegations of money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71956(a)(l)(A)(i), which makes it a federal crime to knowingly conduct and attempt to conduct financial transactions affecting interstate commerce which involve the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity, in this case, Mail and Wire Fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71341 and 1343, with the intent to promote the carrying on of said specified unlawful activity. To that end, I am seeking a seizure warrant for forfeiture of Citizens Bank Account No. 1452-751-0, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7981(a)(l), which provides for the seizure of any and all property which was involved in the transactions constituting money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. 6. FDA is the agency of the United States Government charged with the responsibility of protecting the American public by enforcing the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7301-397, to ensure that, among other things, drugs and medical devices sold for use by or upon humans and animals are safe and effective and bear labeling containing true and accurate information. 7. Since April of 2004, your affiant and investigators from the FDA/OCI Task Force, the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), and the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CID), and individuals from the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) have conducted the investigation detailed below, which has established probable cause to believe that the above-described unlawful activity has been and is being perpetrated by and at the direction of Dr. John E. Curran, a Naturopath whose practice, The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing, operates at the address of One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island. 8. The information set forth in this affidavit is based on information obtained by your affiant and from other investigators involved in this case, interviews conducted by your affiant and other investigators, review of documents, and two separate undercover meetings with John Curran. The affidavit does not contain every fact known to me with respect to this investigation. Rather, it contains those facts that I believe to be necessary to establish probable cause for issuance of a search warrant for the premises of One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island, and for the issuance of a seizure warrant for Citizen's Account No. 1452-751-0. 11. II. Premise to be searched 9. This affidavit is offered in support of a search warrant for the business premises of The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Healing, which is operated by John E. Curran. The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Healing is located at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island 10. One Richmond Square is a three-story brick office complex. A marking of One Richmond Square is located above the main entrance of the building. The premise to be searched is located within One Richmond Square, at Suite 310E, which is located on the third floor of the complex. The entrance door to the office is identified as \"310 E\". 11. Suite 301E, all of which is to be searched, is described as follows: Upon entering the suite there is a patient waiting area. To the right is a bathroom and to the left is a half door, which leads to the \"Pharmacy\" area. Supplement stock is in view on the shelves in the pharmacy area. A doorway, which leads from the waiting room to the main interior office, is located adjacent to the bathroom door. To the right of the main interior office is a room with \"therapy\" equipment. Across from that room is John Curran's office. Located on one side of Curran's office is a \"thermal imaging room\" and on the other side of the office is a room where exams are conducted. There is also door located next to the desk in the main interior office. It is unknown where this doorway leads, A diagram of the suite is attached as part of Attachment A. 111. The Scheme A. Summary 12. The investigation has revealed that John Curran induces patients to purchase expensive treatment plans and for alleged nutritional or therapeutic materials in order to cure them of alleged actual or imminent diseases that Curran claims to have diagnosed. Although he is not qualified to diagnose diseases, Curran advises his patients, among other things, that: (1) they have live parasites in their blood stream; (2) that they have a severely reduced number of blood cells; (3) that they have certain deficient \"body functions;\" (4) that they have worms in their blood; (5) that they have holes in their blood; and (6) that they have a life threatening disease. Curran provides the majority of his diagnoses by performing a \"live blood analysis\" or a \"bio-meridian test.\" As is further described below, neither test is designed to diagnose disease. 13. Upon providing a patient with the diagnoses, Curran promotes and sells the use of his treatment programs or alleged pharmacological materials, the cost of which ranges from approximately $200 to $10,000. Curran accepts cash, checks or credit cards, or, alternatively, promotes a credit service provided by GE Capital that will provide his patients with a line of credit to purchase his services. The line of credit is referred to as a \"Credit Care Card.\" Examples of what he sells are products referred to as \"E-water\", and a super \"green drink.\" Curran claims that E-water is therapeutic water, but the investigation has determined it is regular distilled water that Curran labels as \"E-water.\" The \"green drink\" appears to be a compilation of ingredients with no therapeutic value. B. The Practice of Medicine 14. Under Rhode Island state law (R.I. Gen. Law \u00a7 5-37-I), the \"practice of medicine\" includes: the practice of allopathic and osteopathic medicine. Any person is regarded as practicing medicine . . . who holds himself or herself out as being able to diagnose, treat, operate, or prescribe for any person ill or alleged to be ill with disease, pain, injury, deformity or abnormal physical or mental condition, or who either professes to heal, offer or undertake, by any means or method to diagnose, treat, operate, or prescribe for any person for disease, pain, injury, deformity or physical or mental condition. In addition, one who attaches the title MD, physician, surgeon, D.O., osteopathic physician and surgeon, or any other similar word or words or abbreviation to his or her name indicating that he or she is engaged in the treatment or diagnosis of the diseases, injuries or conditions of persons shall be held to be engaged in the practice of medicine. R.I. Gen. Law \u00a7 5-37-1. 15. Curran is not a licensed physician. However, the investigation has determined that Curran claims to have received a medical degree from St. Luke's School of Medicine located in Liberia, Africa. In addition, he holds himself out in promotional materials as \"Dr. John Curran, N.D., M.D.\" In addition, in his promotional materials, Curran also boasts other academic degrees such as a doctorate in naturopathy from the American Institute of Natural Healing, a doctorate of naturopathic medicine from the Southern College of Naturopathic Medicine and continuing education certificates from Brown University and Harvard University. 16. As outlined below, although Curran is not a licensed physician and cannot legally practice medicine, it is part of his scheme to lead his patients to believe that he has diagnosed serious medical conditions that require immediate attention. However, in response to a complaint filed against him with the R.I. Board of Medicine, and in order to avoid the Board's jurisdiction, Curran's lawyer, A. David Tammelleo, in March of 2003, advised the Board he is not subject to their jurisdiction because he \"is not practicing nor purporting to practice medicine.\" 17. In the letter, Mr. Tammelleo also referenced R.I. Gen. Law \u00a7 23-74-14. Section 23-74-14 states in pertinent part that: All unlicensed health care practitioners shall provide to each unlicensed health care client prior to providing treatment a written copy of the unlicensed health care client bill of rights. A copy must also be posted in a prominent location in the office of the unlicensed health care practitioner. Reasonable accommodations shall be made for those clients who cannot read or who have communication impairments and those who do not read or speak English. The unlicensed health care client bill of rights shall include the following: (1) The name, unlicensed health care title, business address, and telephone number of the unlicensed health care practitioner; (2) The degrees, training, experience, or other qualifications of the practitioner regarding the unlicensed health care being provided, followed by the following statement in bold print: \"The state of Rhode Island has not adopted any educational and training standards for unlicensed health care practitioners. This statement of credentials is for information purposes only. Under Rhode Island law, an unlicensed health care practitioner may not provide a medical diagnosis. If a client desires a diagnosis from a licensed physician, chiropractor, or acupuncture practitioner, or services from a physician, chiropractor, nurse, osteopath, physical therapist, dietician, nutritionist, acupuncture practitioner, athletic trainer, or any other type of health care provider, the client may seek such services at any time\" R.I. Gen. Law \u00a7 23-74-14 (emphasis added). 18. The investigation has revealed that, in compliance with R.I. Gen. Law \u00a7 23-74-14, Curran provides his clients with a document entitled \"Client Bill of Rights,\" in which he advises patients that he is not a licensed physician and which states that an unlicensed health care practitioner may not provide a medical diagnosis. Despite his disclaimer, however, it appears that Curran's method of practice is to identify himself as \"Dr. Curran\" and to induce patients to believe that they are, or will become seriously ill, and that he can cure them or prevent disease. C. Naturopathy 19. According to the Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine, a licensed medical school located in Tempe, Arizona, Naturopathic Medicine is the philosophy of treating disease and restoring health using natural therapies. It strongly promotes prevention in health care and a non-invasive approach to treatment including: acupuncture and oriental medicine, homeopathy, botanical medicine, nutritional counseling, mind-body medicine, hydrotherapy and physical medicine. 20. Naturopathic physicians (NDs) attend a four-year graduate level naturopathic medical program and are educated in all of the same basic sciences as in conventional medical school. Studies concentrate on holistic and nontoxic approaches to therapy with strong emphasis on disease prevention and optimizing wellness. Graduates sit for professional board exams to become licensed as naturopathic doctors within licensed states or as jurisdiction allows. 21. On his website, www.drcurran.com, Curran advises that Naturopathic Medicine \"is a distinct medical system of healthcare: an art, science, and practice of diagnosing and treating people and preventing disease. It honors clients as unique human beings, enabling them to take responsibility for their own health. It is based upon the belief that the body has an innate natural ability to heal itself when given the appropriate internal and external healing environment.\" 22. Curran advises his patients through promotional materials that he is a Board Certified and Licensed General Practitioner of Naturopathic Medicine from the District of Columbia. Your affiant has reviewed an application that Curran submitted to the District of Columbia for a license. It appears that Curran paid $150 for the application. He represented in the application that he attended the American Institute of Natural Healing and competed 2200 hours of course work and received a naturopath degree/certificate in 1998. However, your affiant is not aware of any record that Curran is a licensed naturopathic \"physician\" who has taken any board exams. D. St. Luke's Medical School 23. Your affiant has reviewed records from St. Luke's Medical School. Investigation by IRS/CID SA Ferraro identified a California based extension of St. Luke's School. In response to this investigation, St. Luke's provided SA Ferraro with a hand written response advising that the school has no records indicating that John Curran was ever a student at the college. SA Ferraro has advised your affiant that there is an ongoing federal investigation regarding the sale of fraudulent degrees with regard to St. Luke's School of Medicine. E. The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing 24. The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Healing is an active licensed corporation within the State of Rhode Island. It is also a member of the Better Business Bureau (BBB). A review of the company's BBB application showed that the company is engaged in \"alternative health care.\" John Curran, N.D. M.D. is listed as the Owner/Medical Director. Curran originally operated his business, then called Rhode Island Health Aid, at 743 Reservoir Ave., Cranston, RI. He moved the practice to his current Richmond Square address and changed the name of the business to The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing in approximately July of 2002. F. Live Blood Analysis 25. Investigation by your affiant has determined that on April 10, 1997, John Curran, of 743 Reservoir Avenue, Cranston, Rhode Island, purchased a NuLife Sciences Laboratory Grade Research Microscope, Serial # 204134. The Microscope was sold to Curran by PSI Resource/NuLife Sciences, 2404 Vineyard Place, Boulder CO. Among other accessories, the device came with a Panasonic CCD Color Camera with transformer and microscope slides. The investigation has revealed that Curran uses the device to perform blood analysis and improperly diagnose disease. 26. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the term \"device\" means: an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or accessory, which is: (1) recognized in the official National Formulary, or the United States Pharmacopoeia, or any supplement to them, (2) intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation's, treatment, or prevention's of disease, in man or other animals; or (3) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals; and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body of man or other animals and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(h). 27. Your affiant has made contact with numerous individuals who hold various positions within FDA for assistance in this investigation. I have met with Beth Griffin, Engineer/Investigator for the FDA-New England District and provided her with documentation regarding the NuLife Sciences Laboratory Grade Research Microscope. Griffin has advised me that the device is not cleared or approved by FDA for use as a medical device. 28. In addition, Curran knows that the analysis is not to be used for diagnoses. On June 9, 1998, Curran, on behalf of RI Health Aid, sent a letter to the RIDOH regarding the subject of Live Blood Evaluation. In the letter, Curran writes that \"[u]nder State and Federal Laws, people receiving services considered to be of an experimental research nature by the FDA/AMA must be informed of such. Nutritional live blood evaluation is of a nutritional nature and is not for a medical diagnosis, treatment, disease prevention, or health assessment. All evaluations are screenings for research purposes only.\" (emphasis added). Nonetheless, the investigation, as summarized below, has demonstrated that John Curran is utilizing this device in the diagnosis of disease, to include blood parasites, cancer, and white blood cell anomalies. G. BioMeridian Stress Assessment 29. Investigation by your affiant has determined that John Curran purchased a BioMeridian Stress Assessment Device from BioMeridian International. The BioMeridian Stress Assessment Device (which is also referred to as the Meridian Stress Assessment) is referred to as a \"galvanic device\" and cleared by FDA as a Class Il medical device for the measurement of the electrical resistance of the skin. Your affiant has reviewed sample printouts from the device and, in essence, they list different body systems and functions, such as heart, endocrine system, cellular metabolism and provide a reading for how each responds to the test. No galvanic skin response devices, including the BioMeridian Stress Assessment Device, are cleared or approved by the FDA for the use in the diagnosis of disease. Your affiant's investigation has determined that Curran uses this device in conjunction with the Live Blood Evaluation to provide diagnoses of diseases in patients, contrary to federal and state regulation. H. E-Water 30. Your affiant has reviewed the promotional pamphlet that John Curran provides to his clients regarding E-Water. On that document, Curran states that \"each drop of this water will refresh your body and increase your vitality. Homeopathy has proven that water has remarkable memory and capacity to store energy. This specially energized water contains the same synergistic healing properties as the water in Lourdes, France. - Dr. John E. Curran, N.D., M.D.\" 31. The document further claims that \"Body Balancing E-Water is uniquely charged water wherein the molecules spin in the reverse direction and emit electrical energy which your body's organs absorb to function at its optimal capacity. The elderly, adults, and children as well as animals and plants, can benefit dramatically from taking this E-Water. It is recommended for ALL ages. This water does not act as a stimulant.\" 32. Your affiant has spoken to David Uliss, Chief - Forensic Sciences, RIDOH and provided him with a copy of the E-Water pamphlet. Subsequent to examining the document, Dr. Uliss advised your affiant that the claims were \"ridiculous as a matter of science,\" advising that water molecules are constantly spinning in all directions and that the notion of providing a charge for organ absorption was \"absolutely without any scientific merit.\" I. The Machines 33. Your affiant is also aware that, as part of his sales pitch, Curran attempts to sell his patients a full treatment protocol that is to be performed by using certain machines, which have been described as follows: (1) hydrotherapy massage machine; (2) spectra collor spa system; (3) hyperbaric chamber; massager (5) ionic cleaner; (6) massage capsule; and (7) personal sauna with white plastic hoses. Each machine is discussed below in the context of Curran's representations about each to his patients or to an undercover agent. IV. Victims 34. As part of this investigation, your affiant and other investigators conducted interviews of the following former patients of Curran: RD: (In the interest of confidentiality of the patients, only the initials for each patient are included herein.) 35. In February of 2003, RD, a former patient of John Curran, provided a written complaint to the RIDOH regarding the treatment he had received from Curran. That statement provided the following information, in substance: 36. On September 30, 2002, RD went to see Curran at One Richmond Square, Suite 310E, for an initial consultation. Curran spent about a half -hour asking how RD was feeling. After the initial meeting, Curran asked RD to return the following week for some tests to see what Curran could find. During the follow-up visit, Curran performed the Meridian Stress Assessment on RD. Curran claimed that the procedure tested for \"food allergies\" and \"the body's vital functions.\" Curran presented RD with a computer printout of the foods RD was \"allergic\" to and told him that he was deficient on 55 of the 62 body functions that were tested. Curran performed a second test that involved getting a blood sample from RD1s finger. Through a microscope image of the alleged drawn blood, Curran showed RD what he called \"blood parasites\" and told RD that his body was infected with them. Curran advised RD that he was \"very sick\" and that he needed a complete detoxification, which would cost him $4,500. RD subsequently signed a contract for the program and began the treatment. 37. Curran's treatment called for RD to stay on a liquid diet that consisted only of a product identified by Curran as the \"Super Green Drink\" formula for a period of four (4) weeks. The Super Green Drink Formula is a powder that Curran manufactures and sells to his clients. RD's weight when he started the liquid diet was 149 lbs. Three (3) weeks and three (3) days later, RD's weight had dropped to 124 lbs. 38. When RD called Curran to tell him he was down to 126 Ibs., Curran indicated that he didn't care if RD lost another 25 pounds but advised that RD must stay on the diet, after which Curran proceeded to prescribe to him $208.33 worth of pills and other liquid formulas. It took RD over a year to get back to his present weight of 150 lbs. RD advised that he paid Curran a total of $3500. ML: 39. On August 11, 2004, ML, a former patient of John Curran, was interviewed by your affiant and provided the following information, in substance: 40. On July 22, 2004, ML had a complete medical assessment performed by Curran at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, for which ML was charged $950.00. As part of that examination, Curran performed numerous tests including a Meridian Stress Assessment and Live Blood Analysis. ML advised that Curran introduced himself as \"doctor\" Curran and wore a name tag that read \"Dr. Curran.\" Additionally, ML advised that on the walls of his office Curran had four (4) certificates from various institutions including Harvard Medical School. 41. During the visit, ML stated that Curran told her that he had cured four (4) people who had Hepatitis C. After conducting the blood analysis test, Curran advised ML that she was infested with blood parasites and showed ML two slides that allegedly contained ML's blood. Curran pointed out \"worms and eggs\" that were ready to hatch within ML's blood. Curran told ML that she had \"only one good blood cell with the others being deformed.\" Upon completion of the Stress Assessment Test, Curran provided ML with a printout of the results, which indicated that ML had five (5) out of (62) bodily function readings that were \"good\", with the rest being \"stressed\" or \"weakened.\" ML informed your affiant that she was surprised,at the results of her blood test because just a couple of weeks prior to her exam with Curran she had been to the hospital on an unrelated matter at which time a blood evaluation had been conducted and no abnormalities were found. 42. After providing ML with his results, Curran addressed a proper course of action. Curran took ML to a room in the office that contained various machines. Curran advised ML that using the machines was the \"fast cure\" to rid her of her parasite infestation. He proposed a treatment plan for $10,000.00 for a total of ten (10) visits which would allow her to use each of the machines. ML subsequently told Curran that the price was too expensive. Curran then stated that he would return to his office and formulate the necessary list of items from his \"pharmacy\" that ML would need to be cured. ML stated that, some time later, Curran returned to the patient room and provided ML with a list of items totaling $5,000.00. Curran also provided ML with an application for a Credit Care card, which, if approved, would provide her with financing for Curran's services. ML filled out the application for the card, but advised the office not to forward her application until she had a chance to discuss the matter with her husband. ML also provided Curran's office with a check for $600.00 as an initial payment for the items Curran had listed and advised Curran that she would return the next day to provide payment in full. ML stated that she felt very pressured at the time of her visit to buy the prescribed \"medications.\" 43. ML advised that after discussing her visit with her husband, and thinking about what had occurred during her visit, she felt as if she had been the victim of an attempted fraud. ML advised that she then contacted her bank (Sovereign Bank) and put a stop payment on the check she had provided to Curran. LM: 44. On September 27, 2004, Bruce McIntyre at the RIDOH interviewed LM, a former patient of John Curran. LM provided the following information, in substance: 45. LM went to see Curran at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, after reading about him in a local health magazine. LM had her initial consultation with Curran on August 6, 2004. LM stated that she went to see Curran because she wanted to lose weight and stop smoking. After this initial consultation, Curran scheduled LM to come to the office for a complete medical assessment on August 13, 2004, for which LM was ultimately charged $950.00. LM advised that the medical assessment lasted between 4-5 hours. As part of the exam, Curran conducted several tests including a live blood analysis and a stress assessment test. Subsequent to taking a blood sample from LM's finger, Curran advised LM that she was infested with blood parasites and that the parasites had been in LM's system a long time and had become \"double-headed.\" After conducting the stress assessment, Curran produced a printout that he told LM indicated that she had four (4) out of (62) bodily functions that were good with the rest being \"stressed\" or \"weakened.\" LM also informed that during her exam Curran told her that he had cured patients who had Stage IV Cancer. 46. Subsequent to advising her of his diagnosis, Curran provided LM with a list of items from his \"pharmacy\" that LM would need to take. Included on the provided list were a \"Super Green Drink\", a powder made by Curran that cost $1,195.00, and \"Dr. Curran's Unique Body Balancing E-Water\" that cost $45.00 per bottle and also was produced by Curran. In total, Curran charged LM $4,806.97. AD: 47. On September 27, 2004, LD, the mother of AD, met with a member of the RIDOH and filed a complaint, including a written statement, regarding the treatment her daughter had received from John Curran. LD provided the following information, in substance: 48. AD (age 24), who is temporarily living in San Diego, was diagnosed with Celiac Disease (gluten and wheat allergies) while living in California. AD came home to Rhode Island for a week and decided to seek another opinion regarding her illness. Dr. John Curran was recommended. Curran listed himself as an MD as well as an ND, and that convinced LD and AD to utilize his services. 49. On Tuesday, August 31, 2004, AD had an afternoon appointment with Curran. Curran initially had a technician perform what he referred to as a Full Body Medical Imaging Scan. Curran then explained to AD that there were many blood and other tests that he needed to be performed to obtain an accurate diagnosis. Curran asked AD to return on Saturday, September 4, to complete those tests. AD was scheduled to fly back to San Diego on Sunday the 5th and had other plans for Saturday. Curran stated that he would be in his office later in the evening on Tuesday the 31st and that he would wait for AD in order to complete the tests. AD asked her mother, LD, to accompany her to Curran's office for the evening appointment. 50. At the onset of that appointment, Curran explained his testing procedures, and AD and LD subsequently went in to the examining room where the tests would take place. Curran proceeded to perform his exam. As part of that exam, Curran pricked AD's finger tips, put blood samples on a glass slab, put that slab under the microscope and projected the \"living blood cells\" onto a monitor, enabling both AD and LD to view what he proceeded to diagnose. 51. Curran showed what he stated were \"parasites\" living in AD's blood cells. He said that her blood was infested with these parasites and that her immune system was so overworked trying to kill them on a daily basis that when other germs and bacteria entered her system, the immune system was too tired to fight. Curran also showed LD and AD \"white formations\" in the cells, which he said were \"holes\" in the blood. He also showed what the \"healthy\" color of blood cells should be and what you wouldn't want to see for coloration. Curran showed another view of AD'S cells and said they were tainted \"green,\" which was an indication of early cancer. Curran advised that this was the \"worst\" blood work he had ever seen and advised LD that she had to picture AD standing on the edge of a cliff. Curran indicated that if AD were not treated immediately, with drastic measures, AD would \"fall off the cliff' within one to two years. Curran also told AD that she had thyroid problems and a dysfunctional pituitary gland that were making her age three years to every one. LD advised investigators that she was \"devastated\" upon hearing the diagnosis. However, Curran told LD and AD that this diagnosis was reversible, informing that \"drastic measures were required for drastic situations.\" Curran claimed that he could cure AD with a very intensive ten-days of therapy. 52. Curran walked LD and AD into his therapy chamber and showed them a Hyperbaric Chamber, Hydrotherapy Massage Machine, and a Spectracolor Spa System. Curran stated that the theory behind the therapy was that he had to \"kill\" the parasites in her blood cells as quickly as possible with intensive heat, detoxify the body of nasty matter, supplement her diet with herbal treatments, and put her on a nutritional diet. Curran stated that the protocol would cost $10,000. Curran stated that he knew that LD and AD had a lot to digest but advised them \"not to lose sleep over it.\" Curran explained to LD and AD that they could have a credit application prepared right then and there to see if they qualified for the cost of treatment. Curran advised that many of his patients were not prepared to come up with money out of pocket and utilized the credit service. Curran provided LD with an application for a Creditcare card which LD filled out and which was immediately submitted by the office. LD was approved for the issuance of credit prior to her leaving the office. 53. At the conclusion of the exam, LD was presented with a bill in the amount of $1355.33 for all of the tests conducted that night. Curran suggested that AD call her boss in California to say that she was delaying her return and to delay her flight back for a couple of weeks. The next day, LD and AD were supposed to pick up a diet plan for AD, and AD was scheduled to begin therapy. LD wrote out a check for $1355.33 and left the office. 54. LD relayed Curran's diagnosis to her husband, ED, who suggested that AD see her primary care physician, Dr. Jennifer Jeremiah, prior to beginning treatment with Curran. On Thursday, September 2, 2004, AD met with Dr. Jennifer Jeremiah. AD informed her of everything Curran had said and showed her some of the test results. Dr. Jeremiah advised AD that she was the second of her patients who had visited Curran and who had been given a life-threatening diagnosis. Dr. Jeremiah subsequently conducted a full physical exam on AD, including blood work. 55. Your affiant has subsequently met with and spoken to Dr. Jeremiah, who advised your affiant that, with the exception of Celiac Disease, AD is a healthy 24-year-old with no indication of cancer or any other life-threatening illness. Her thyroid is normal, as is her pituitary gland. Dr. Jeremiah further informed your affiant that the only parasites that can be detected through blood work are those connected with malaria and that AD had not been exposed to malaria nor had any such symptoms. 56. LD informed investigators that she stopped payment on her check to Curran immediately and contacted her lawyer who forwarded a letter to Curran addressing this issue. The possible impact of the letter on this investigation is discussed below. 57. On October 19, 2001, your affiant and TFA Christopher Cardarelli met with LD at her residence. LD reiterated her statements previously made at the RIDOH. LD also added that during their time with Curran, Curran told LD that he had cured patients with Stage IV Cancer. (Curran made the identical claim to client LM). CR: 58. On December 13, 2004, your affiant interviewed CR, a former patient of John Curran, at CR's residence located in Sterling, Massachusetts. CR provided the following information, in substance: 59. On November 30, 2004, CR went to see John Curran at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, after hearing about him from a work colleague. CR stated that he went to see Curran because he wanted to lose weight. Curran conducted a complete medical assessment exam for which CR was charged $950.00. CR advised that the exam lasted several hours. As part of the exam, Curran conducted several tests, including a live blood analysis and a stress assessment test. The first test Curran conducted was the blood analysis test. For that test, Curran took a blood sample from CR's finger which he placed on three glass slides. Curran placed the slides, one at a time, under a microscope that was hooked up to a computer monitor. Curran then reviewed the blood and advised CR that he had \"clumpy\" red blood cells. Curran further informed CR that his red blood cells had \"holes in them.\" Curran stated that CR's white blood cells had a \"glowing aura\" around them and pointed out \"inch worm\" like creatures moving around CR's blood. CR stated that, after pointing out each one of these conditions, Curran would exclaim \"that's not good\" or \"this doesn't look good.\" Curran also showed CR a pamphlet which had pictures of what \"healthy\" blood cells should look like and what one would not want to see. Curran's final diagnoses was that CR's immune system was fatigued and that he had a virus in his blood. 60. Subsequent to the blood analysis, Curran conducted a BioMeridian Stress Assessment test. After conducting test, Curran produced a printout that he told CR indicated that CR had three (3) out of (62) bodily functions that were good, with the rest being \"stressed\" or 'weakened.\" 61. After advising CR of his diagnosis, Curran provided him with a list of items from his \"pharmacy\" that CR would need to take to improve his health. Included on the list were the \"Green Drink\" formula and \"Dr. Curran's Unique Body Balancing E-Water.\" Additionally, Curran scheduled a machine therapy protocol for CR which was intended to \"pull the toxins out\" of CR's body and \"kill the virus\" in CR's blood. CR advised that he agreed to purchase both the supplements and treatment program suggested by Curran. 62. To help him finance his treatment, CR filled out a Credit Care card application which was provided to him by Curran's office manager and approved for credit while CR was still at Curran's office. At the conclusion of his appointment CR's Credit Care account was charged the sum of $6,719.08 for the exam, supplements and therapy treatment program. CR has subsequently contacted Curran's office and notified them that he had decided not be participate in the therapy program and requested that his Credit Care account be credited for the corresponding charge (2,995.00). CR advised that he was told by someone at Curran's office that they would make the credit, however, as of December 3, 2004, no such credit had been issued. V. Undercover Operation 63. In addition to the above-cited patients, and as part of this investigation, an undercover, monitored, operation was initiated as described below. A. Task Force Agent (TFA) Al Faella 64. On September 17, 2004, TFA Albert Faella, while working in an undercover capacity, went to Curran's office located at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island, for a previously scheduled exam. Your affiant has listened to a recording of that meeting as well as spoken to TFA Faella about that meeting which is summarized as follows: 65. As part of the exam, Curran pricked a blood sample from TFA Faella's finger and smeared the sample on three (3) individual glass sample slides. Curran subsequently requested a urine sample from TFA Faella for which TFA Faella had to exit the exam room. When TFA Faella returned with the requested urine sample, Curran was sitting in front of a microscope. TFA Faella sat in the chair next to Curran, looking at a monitor, which appeared to be wired to a camera mounted on the microscope. Curran appeared to TFA Faella to have a slide already in the microscope and pointed out to TFA Faella what his red and white blood cells looked like. Curran stated that the white blood cells should be perfectly round and proceeded to change the glass slide in the microscope. Curran tested the urine sample and stated that TFA Faella's urine was acidic at 5.0 which is completely acidic. Upon looking at the new slide, Curran stated that there was something wrong with TFA Faella's white blood cells because they were not shaped completely round and some were not fully-grown. Upon further examining the slide, Curran spotted what he called a \"microimbulei.\" He stated that once one is seen, \"they're like roaches\", and guaranteed that there are \"millions in the body,\" which Curran explained meant TFA Faella's \"immune system is not functioning optimally or else it would not let anything grow in the body.\" 66. Curran also added that it looked like TFA Faella had a little bit of liver toxicity and spider webbing. Curran went on to say that TFA Faella had a lot of cell deformity and that his immune system needed total regeneration because Curran could not find one good cell. Curran advised TFA Faella that \"they're all deformed\" (referring to Faella's white blood cells) and that if TFA Faella stayed like this that his immune system would allow other things to grow and eventually become premature diseases. TFA Faella asked Curran if what he had been shown floating in his blood was a parasite and Curran responded \"correct\" and that it was easy enough to treat. Curran stated that he also had seen a couple of clots forming in TFA Faella's blood and observed eggs starting to grow, stating that within twenty-four hours the eggs would be huge. Curran went on to say that they (referring to the parasite eggs) are deep seated within the cells and the immune system cannot get at them. When asked by TFA Faella about how to get rid of the parasites, Curran replied that he was working on a program in his head. 67. Curran informed TFA Faella that the next slide in the blood test would show if the parasites had caused any damage to the body. While conducting this test, Curran explained that the bar graph on the monitor should show a solid red line and that any break in that line would indicate some type of weakness within the system. In conducting this test, Curran stated that he did see something happening in TFA Faella's system but did not know whether the condition would mature in six months or six years, and then revised his answer to one year, adding that this test would have to be performed every three months. Curran also observed some holes in TFA Faella's blood smear, which Curran stated indicated that something was starting to happen. Curran explained that when he sent other similar patients for scans they always come back positive for cancer. However, in the case of TFA Faella, Curran advised that he would be able to reverse the condition now, in this stage, quite easily. Curran went on to say that TFA Faella's fiber net is all broken which indicates glucose intolerance. Curran asked TFA Faella if he took any painkillers, to which TFA Faella replied \"no\" and inquired why Curran was asking. Curran stated that TFA Faella had a little discoloration of the blood and indicated that he (Curran) could see orange/greenish specks which indicate diseases. Curran stated that he has an eighty-percent success rate and could get TFA Faella's blood back to that of a twenty-year-old. Curran went on to say that TFA Faella had adrenal stress which was sitting on top of his kidneys and causing fatigue and that he also saw purple in the blood sample which is a sign of malabsorbtion of nutrients. 68. In the next test he performed, Curran placed a clear liquid in the palm of TFA Faella's hand and had him grasp a small, approximately five-inch brass bar, which was connected to a computer system labeled BioMeridian Health Assessment test. Curran advised TFA Faella to grasp the bar loosely. Curran was holding on to a pen-like probe which he would push against TFA Faella's joints on the opposite hand and foot and then changed to the other side to complete the test. Curran explained that the testing system he was using was the most state of the art in the United States and that the test would measure the various bodily organs and lymphatics and detennine whether something was wrong in one of the internal organs. Curran proceeded to explain how this is a very important test to have done at least once a year to determine if a body has disease in it or not. While conducting the test, Curran informed TFA Faella that he had gall bladder problems and that his kidneys were super-stressed. At the end of the testing, Curran stated that the printer was not working and he could therefore not supply a copy of the test, but would keep it in the file. He went on to say that out of the sixty-two tests the machine scans for, TFA Faella had only passed five of them, but that within a month Curran would have TFA Faella back in shape. 69. After completing the assessment test, Curran had TFA Faella sit on an exam table where he looked at TFA Faella's fingernails on both hands and indicated to TFA Faella that his oxygen system wasn't working properly. Curran went on to say that because he did not see any half moons in the fingernails that it was a sign of degeneration and that 80-90 % of all his cancer patients have no moons in their fingernails. Curran also examined TFA Faella's tongue, took his body temperature, and checked his eyes. Curran stated that TFA Faella's pupils were pulsating, which meant that TFA Faella's glandular system was running out. 70. Upon completion of the exam, TFA Faella was instructed to get dressed and wait in Curran's office. Curran subsequently returned to the office and began to talk about several treatment protocols with TFA Faella. The first treatment discussed involved TFA Faella subsisting for a period of 30 days on only the Green Drink formula, 64 ounces of carrot juice a day and numerous other supplements Curran would supply to kill the parasites. Curran stated that this program would keep TFA Faella's blood squeaky-clean and heal everything. Curran went on to state that the only thing that worried him was the formation of TFA Faella's white blood cells because none of them were correct and he did not know why. But, Curran stated, in thirty days the cells would become perfectly round. 71. Curran then offered TFA Faella another treatment program to be done in addition to the above-cited supplement program. This therapy would last for a period of ten days and was intended to deactivate pesticides and heavy metals and excrete them as well as any deep seated microbes. Curran proceeded to show TFA Faella the therapy room that was located across his office and described each machine in the room and its function. 72. The first was a hyperbaric chamber which Curran stated was used for people who have had a stoke or brain damage and which supplies high-pressure oxygen. The next machine was a Hydro Massager which had an infra red light above it and, according to Curran, was supposed to stimulate the thyroid into producing healthy white blood cells. The beam saturates the body, which deactivates microbes from reproducing as well as cancer cells, viruses and bacteria with a high frequency. 73. The next piece of equipment shown to TFA Faella was an ionic cleanser, a machine in which clients would put their feet. While the machine appeared to TFA Faella to be a simple foot massager, Curran advised that, while in use, a person could actually see the garbage coming out of the body and floating up in the water. Curran described the garbage coming out of the body as browns, greens and all sorts of different colors. 74. The next piece of equipment shown to TFA Faella was a massage capsule, in which a client would lie inside. The apparatus had a black light above it where a person's head would be. Curran stated the machine provided cold light therapy. Curran advised that the machine would reprogram the immune system and fight against infections. 75. The final piece of equipment that Curran showed TFA Faella was a personal sauna in which a person's head would be sticking out of the unit as it heats up. Attached to the unit were two small white plastic hoses from which Curran advised O2 and O3 were being pumped into the unit, which heats up to 110 degrees. According to Curran, O3 takes pesticides out of the cells. 76. Curran and TFA Faella then returned back to Curran's office to discuss which form of therapy would be best. Curran then advised that a full course of treatment, utilizing the above-described machines would cost $10,000.00. A plan involving only supplements would cost several thousand. Curran reiterated to TFA Faella that the $10,000.00 program was best, stating that it's the only form of treatment that will completely erase everything wrong with TFA Faella. TFA Faella advised Curran that his schedule would not allow him to use the machine protocol and he would opt instead for the supplement program. Curran again tried selling a shorter time period machine-based treatment protocol, which TFA Faella refused. Curran then left the office to devise a supplement protocol for TFA Faella. Curran subsequently returned with a list of supplements for TFA Faella to purchase. The products included two supplements that Curran advised he produced himself. The first of these was the \"E-water\", which is bottled water bearing the, said trade name. Curran advised that this water reverses the molecules in the body. The second was the \"Green Drink\" formula which, Curran claimed, contained every nutrient that the body needs. The E-Water was sold for a cost of $45.00 for a four-(4) ounce bottle and a white unlabeled bucket of green powder to make the \"Green Drink\" sold for a cost of $675.00. 77. TFA Faella purchased all of the supplements with official government funds, supplied by the FDA, using Sovereign Bank check No. 109 for the total sum of $3,729.00, which included the full body exam. Sovereign Bank subsequently provided your affiant with a copy of the cited check which indicated that it had been deposited into Citizens Bank, Account No. 1452-751-0, held in the name of The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing. Your affiant is aware of the process by which a check issued by Sovereign Bank is processed. Your affiant is aware that prior to the funds being deposited into Citizens Bank, Account No. 1452-751-0, a series of interstate bank wire transfers occurred culminating with the funds being deposited into the identified account. 78. On September 16, 2004, immediately following TFA Faella's exam with Curran, your affiant accompanied TFA Faella to Pawtucket Memorial Hospital, 11 Brewster Street, Pawtucket, RI. Upon arrival, Faella met with Dr. Noubar Kessimian, in a previously arranged meeting, for the purposes of supplying Dr. Kessimian with a blood sample for testing for the presence of blood parasites. TFA provided the necessary blood sample, which was tested at Memorial Hospital. Dr. Kessimian subsequently provided your affiant with a printout of the lab results, which were negative for the presence of parasites. Dr. Kessimian has also advised your affiant that blood parasites are extremely rare and are almost exclusively found as a result of contracting Malaria, a disease not present in this geographical area. B. Postal Inspector (PI) PI Correia 79. On October 8, 2004, Postal Inspector (PI) Al Correia, while working in an undercover capacity, went to the office of John Curran at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, as part of a previously scheduled exam. Your affiant has listened to a recording of that meeting as well as spoken to PI Correia about that meeting which is summarized as follows: 80. Upon PI Correia's arrival, Curran reviewed a pre-exam form filled out by PI Correia and advised that it was a typical \"kill me diet.\" Curran stated that 99 percent of the people he treats are riddled with disease and, with PI Correia, Curran has an opportunity to stop it before PI Correia became diseased. 81. In the exam room, Curran initially conducted a Live Blood Analysis. Curran pricked PI Correia's right index finger and smeared blood on three (3) glass slides. Curran stated the microscope he was utilizing was not hooked up to the monitor screen at this time and he would let PI Correia look into the microscope viewfinder if he found something. 82. Curran then placed a blood slide on the microscope and told PI Correia that his blood cells should be perfectly round. He had PI Correia look in the microscope and noted that the blood cells were not round. Curran showed PI Correia a picture of healthy blood cells and then a picture of what PI Correia's blood cells looked like. Curran stated it was Rulo [sic], which could be, amongst other things, degenerative disease, liver disease, cancer, etc. Curran told PI Correia that he did not know exactly what it was but that PI Correia's system was not functioning correctly. 83. Curran stated the next blood slide could give him an answer. He then requested that PI Correia go to the bathroom and provide a urine sample. When PI Correia returned to the exam room, Curran tested the urine and stated that it was normal. Curran then looked at another blood slide and told PI Correia that he did not have any tumors but did have heavy metal, probably heavy metal poisoning. Curran stated that PI Correia had a yeasty buildup that could trigger a premature disease if not treated. 84. Curran stated the next test would check PI Correia's electroconductivity. A clear liquid was placed in the palm of PI Correia's hand and he was given a small bar (approximately five inches long) to hold in the hand. On the computer monitor screen there was a graph labeled Bio Meridian Health Assessment, which would tell Curran if the organ tested is stressed or weakened. Curran touched PI Correia's other hand and foot with a pen like device, producing readings on the graph. While touching the pen like object to PI Correia's foot, Curran told PI Correia that his liver was super stressed. Curran stated 17 out of 62 bodily functions were in the norm. Curran explained that the body fires electricity and this machine checks the firing of that electricity, which occurs in every area of one's body. Subsequent to conducting the test, Curran provided PI Correia with a printout of the results. Curran stated that PI Correia's weakest areas were his right lung and small intestines. The assessment indicated that only 17 out of 62 bodily functions were operating in a \"balanced\" state with the others being either \"stressed\" or \"weakened.\" Included in those systems that were identified as stressed or weakened were the lymphatics, lungs, large intestine, nervous system, circulation, allergies, cellular metabolism, endocrine system, small intestine, connective tissue, gallbladder, kidneys and urinary bladder. Curran advised PI Correia that after continuous visits to his office, PI Correia would be perfect. 85. During the meeting, PI Correia asked Curran if he should be concerned that his blood cells were not round. Curran advised that they were round but coagulated and clumpy, which could cause heart attack and stroke if it caused blockage of the arteries. Curran stated that because PI Correia's blood was clumpy he couldn't read it in that state. Curran then stated he could get PI Correia into a program that would make him perfect. 86. Curran suggested a rejuvenation program consisting of not eating for 30 days while subsisting on the \"Green Drink,\" which would repair every cell in PI Correia's body. Curran also advised that PI Correia could drink the Green Drink for breakfast and lunch but eat a good dinner at night. Curran stated that this protocol would make PI Correia perfect and keep him there. This protocol would stop PI Correia's blood cells from sticking together. Curran advised PI Correia that the Green Drink formula took him ten years to formulate and that he puts 100 products in the formula. Cunan informed that it took half a year, working with scientists, to put the 100 products in the drink. Curran stated the drink totally repairs every cell in the body, PI Correia told Curran that he would purchase the supplements he suggested. Curran gave PI Correia a list of items totaling $2,715.82, which included the full body exam. PI then stated he would purchase the items at a later date. 87. The exam, at a cost of $950.00, was paid for by official government funds, supplied by the FDA, using an undercover Mastercard credit card. Your affiant subsequently contacted Mastercard and was advised that the transaction cited resulted in a wire of funds in the amount of $950.00 to the U.S. Bank National Association located in Knoxville TN. Your affiant is aware that company is a credit card clearing house. Funds from that institution were then wire transferred to Citizens Bank in Rhode Island, Account No. 1452-751-0, held in the name of The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing. 88. On October 19, 2004, PI Correia met with Dr. Paul J. Agatiello, MD., F.A.C.P. for the purposes of receiving a comprehensive medical exam as a second opinion to diagnosis received from Curran during Correia's October 8, 2004 exam. In his Summary Statement, Dr. Agatiello wrote \"[t]o a reasonable degree of medical certainty, this physician finds NO evidence by history or physical examination of abnormalities of the lymphatics, lungs, large intestine, nervous system, circulation, allergies, endocrine system, small intestine, connective tissue, gallbladder, kidneys or urinary bladder.\" 89. Your affiant's investigation determined that PI Correia is the first person identified in this case that has not been diagnosed with deformities, such as parasites or worms, in his blood. According to PI Correia, during his exam with Curran, blood was drawn from his finger and placed under the microscope. Curran told PI Correia that the computer screen monitoring system, which Curran has used with all other identified patients to show the presence of parasites, was not hooked up and was not being used. 90. Your affiant is aware that just prior to PI Correia's visit, Frank S. Lombardi, attorney for AD, sent a letter from his office on September 7, 2004. In that letter attorney Lombardi accused Curran, among other things, of performing unnecessary work and charging expensive fees. Lombardi also notified Curran that his client had requested a stop payment on the check she wrote to him and that she had notified the Board of Medical Licensure regarding her visit to Curran's office. P.I. Correia visited Curran after the letter was sent to Lombard. 91. Also, of note. at the bottom of PI Al Correia's BioMeridian Stress Assessment analysis, provided by Curran, the following is written: \"The MSAS equipment does not provide a medical diagnosis. If patients feel they need a diagnosis, they should consult with their physician.\" Your affiant has reviewed similar assessment analysis reports provided to other patients of John Curran. That review revealed that in all cases, for patients seen prior to PI Correia and prior to the Lombardi letter, no such statement is made. Despite the disclaimer that has been added to the Stress Assessment test, based upon your affiant's review of the audiotapes of both undercover visits by TFA Faella and PI Correia, Curran never verbally advised either that he could not provide the diagnoses and that they should consult their physician if they felt they needed a diagnoses. VI. Peer Review of Currant's Treatment Protocol 92. In addition to the statements obtained above from Dr. Jennifer Jeremiah and Dr. Noubar Kessimian, I have also reviewed comments by a third doctor regarding Dr. Curran's methods. As part of its initial investigation, the RIDOH forwarded copies of Curran's promotional documents for review by Doctor Tim Gorski, MD Fellow at the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (FACOG). On November 4, 2002, Dr. Gorski wrote a letter in response to the forwarded materials. Your affiant has reviewed Dr. Gorski's assessments in which he provides his medical opinion that many of Curran's treatments are of an unproven or disproven nature. In particular part, Dr. Gorski provided the following information to RIDOH: The \"BioMeridian Stress Assessment\" appears to be a variation on electrodiagnostic methods that are well-known forms of medical fraud. The procedure consists of grounding the patient, then using a probe to pass low levels of electrical current through the patient. Various dials connected to the circuit are then claimed to measure the status of the patient's health. However, the resistance/current measured only reflects nonspecific effects such as how hard the probe is pushed against the patient. 93. Dr. Gorski also stated that naturopaths do not prevent, cure, diagnose or treat disease. VII. Glen Lynch 94. On May 11, 2004, your affiant along with PI Al Correia interviewed Glen Lynch. Glen Lynch had contacted the RIDOH and requested a meeting to discuss John Curran. Glen Lynch provided your affiant the following information, in substance: 95. Glen Lynch informed that he is the brother-in-law of John Curran. Glen Lynch stated that John Curran was engaged in certain unethical activities for which Glen Lynch had specific information. Glen Lynch stated that he was, until recently, employed by Curran at his medical office and as the day-to-day operator and owner of Eve's Herbal Garden, a vitamin supplement store on 743 Reservoir Avenue in Cranston, RI. Cumin's previous practice, Rhode Island Health Aid, was originally at the same address on Reservoir Avenue. According to Glen Lynch, Curran was the real owner of Eve's Herbal Garden with Glen Lynch holding the title in name only. 96. Glen Lynch stated that he was asked by Curran to create a \"Super Green Drink\" formula sold by Curran to his patients. Glen Lynch provided investigators with a notepad, which he claimed identified the formula he used to create the \"Green Drink\" and listed the cost of each of the various ingredients in the formula. When Curran had originally asked Glen Lynch to create the drink, he told him to \"make it green and make it taste good.\" Glen Lynch advised that he has no scientific background but attempted to create a formula that contained various healthy nutrients. Glen Lynch stated that Curran would charge up to $1,200.00 for a bucket of the powder. Glen Lynch left the employment of Curran after Curran had approached him regarding the cost of the formula. Curran wanted Glen Lynch to cut the expenses and to just keep it green and tasting good. Glen Lynch stated that he could not honor that request, stating that he felt it was wrong, and that it led to his having a falling out with Curran. Glen Lynch provided your affiant with a jar containing the green drink formula. 97. With regard to the \"E-Water\" that Curran sold, Glen Lynch stated that Curran would purchase gallons of distilled water, which he would place in a transparent like box with a rod in it, which was connected to a plug in electrical power source. Curran would pour the water in the box and let it sit there for a while. Glen Lynch surmised that the box was transparent so that if someone looked at it would appear as if something was happening to the water. Glen Lynch stated that upon his leaving the employment of Curran he had taken the apparatus, which Glen Lynch provided to your affiant. VIII. The Money 98. Glen Lynch has advised your affiant that Curran's business generated significant amounts of cash and that Curran had personally shown him large amounts of cash. Glen Lynch stated that Curran told him that he could not deposit the money into the bank in amounts over $10,000 because of, as Glen Lynch remembers it, \"some IRS rule.\" Glen Lynch also stated that, with regard to his medical practice, Curran told him that he \"wanted to make a couple of million bucks and get out.\" During his undercover visit to Curran's office, TFA Al Faella saw a safe in Curran's office, to the left of his desk, under a credenza. 99. Glen Lynch further informed your affiant that he and Curran had engaged in some fraudulent financial transactions with Glen Lynch's American Express Card and Curran's business, Rhode Island Health, when it was still on Reservoir Avenue. According to Glen Lynch, Curran devised a scheme whereby Curran would bill Glen Lynch's Amex card for fictitious purchases at the store and then split the cash received by the business with Glen Lynch. Glen Lynch stated that both he and Curran were aware that Glen Lynch would not be paying back the charged moneys [3]. Footnote 3. Your affiant is also aware that Glen Lynch has previously pleaded contendere to two state charges of simple assault/domestic and vandalism. 100. American Express has provided your affiant with records for the account of Glen P. Lynch (Acct. No. 3715-628432-52008 & 3721-2171 18-34008). A review of those records indicates that there was in excess of $33,000.00 in charges from Rhode Island Health. Those charges were almost exclusively in round thousand dollar allotments. According to Cathy Curran (No relation) Senior Special Agent, Northeast Region, for American Express, the GL Accounts have not been paid. 101. As part of this investigation, your affiant and other participating investigators have also reviewed numerous financial documents. 102. Your affiant has reviewed records provided by the Rhode Island Department of Administration, Division of Taxation-Employer Tax Section. Those records pertained to wages paid by The Northeastern Institute of Advanced Healing. A review of those records indicates that for calendar year 2003, John Curran claimed wages totaling $21,000. For the first two (2) quarters of calendar year 2004, John Curran reported wages totaling $12,500. 103. Your affiant has determined that John E. Curran currently resides at 66 Falcon Ridge Drive, Exeter, RI. The residence was purchased on August 2, 2004, and the listed owners are John E. Curran and Colleen R. Brophy. The home was purchased for $465,000.00 from Thomas and Valeria Guest. The mortgage payment for the residence are made by John Curran utilizing funds from The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing (Citizens Bank Checking Account No. 1452-75 1-0) 104. Your affiant has reviewed records from GE Capital relating to The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing. GE Capital is the issuing company behind the Creditcare card application that is utilized at Curran's practice. Medical practitioners utilize the card for patients who are in need of a financial payment plan to receive services. SA Robert Ferraro has conducted an analysis of payments made by GE Capital to The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing (Citizens Bank, Account No. 1452-75 1-0). That analysis indicates that for the year 2003, GE Capital sent a total of $120,413.16 in credit deposits to the Citizens Bank account. For the year 2004, to date, similar deposits have been made totaling approximately $210,216.00. Investigation by your affiant has determined that payments made to the identified account are done so by bank wire transfer. Upon approval of credit from GE Capital, a Credit Care card is sent to the client via the U.S. Mails. Subsequent payments to GE Capital can be made by sending payment via the U.S. Mails. 105. As stated above, your affiant's review has determined that it appears that receipts from Curran's business are deposited into Citizens Bank, Account No. 1452-751-0. To date, the investigation has traced certain payments that relate to fraudulent services into Account No. 1452-751-0. 106. On August 13, 2004, LM, the patient identified above, paid $2,000 to Curran's business by using a Visa credit card issued by Household Bank SB NA. Household Bank has confirmed to SA Robert Ferraro that it issued a payment on behalf of LM to The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Healing. 107. Your affiant is also aware that Visa and Mastercard payments are typically processed through a clearing house. On January 5, 2005, your affiant spoke with a representative at Merchant Services. Your affiant was informed that Merchant Services is a credit card clearing house bank. Your affiant was advised that Merchant Services collects payment for credit card charges made through individual companies that utilize a credit card machine provided by Merchant Services or a wholesaler associated with Merchant Services. Your affiant was advised that charges are \"bundled\" and then monies are forwarded to the client after subtracting the fees charged by Merchant Services. Additionally, clients provide Merchant Services with a single bank account where funds are to be forwarded. 108. Your affiant has determined that John Cun-an utilizes Merchant Services and that charges made from his company are forwarded to Citizens Bank Account No. 1452-751-0. Your affiant has also reviewed bank statement for Citizens Bank Account No. 1452-751-0 and identified what appear to be numerous deposits of bundled payment items from Merchant Services, including deposits that occurred after August 13, 2004, when ML used her Visa card to pay Curran. 109. Your affiant is also aware that Merchant Services was utilized by John Curran to process the credit card payment for services he provided to PI Al Correia as fully described above at paragraph 87. 110. In addition, as explained above at paragraph 77, TFA Faella purchased supplements from Curran with official government funds, supplied by the FDA, using Sovereign Bank check No. 109 for the total sum of $3,729.00. Sovereign Bank subsequently provided your affiant with a copy of the cited check which indicated that it had been deposited into Citizens Bank, Account No. 1452-751-0, held in the name of The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing. 111. The investigation has revealed that the proceeds of the scheme are being used to promote the scheme because the funds deposited in the Citizen's Bank account are used to make payment on the business' American Express Account. A partial review of Citizens Bank records for Account No 1452-751-0, for the time period of January 2004 through September 2004, identified monthly checks being made payable to American Express Business Platinum Card, Account No. 3727-150577-83006 83006, held in the name of Dr. John E. Curran/The Northeast Institute. The identified checks include the following: Check No. 2306 written on January 6, 2004 in the amount of $15,591.70; Check No. 5472 written on or about March 1, 2004 in the amount of $23,788.69; Check No. 5666 written on May 1, 2004 in the amount of $27,137.34; Check No. 5769 written on June 13, 2004 in the amount of $17,841.78; Check No. 5820 written on June 28, 2004 in the amount of $28,513.95; Check No. 5930 written on August 6, 2004 in the amount of $14,700.23; and Check No. 2567 written on September 15, 2004 in the amount of $24,935.30 112. Your affiant has conducted a partial review of statements from American Express Business Platinum Card, Account number 3727-150577-83006, for the time period of October 2003 through September 2004, held in the name of Dr. John E. Curran/The Northeast Institute, 38 One Richmond Square, Suite 3 10E Providence, RI. The review identified checks being made payable to various corporations engaged in providing products and services utilized by Dr. John E. Curran and the Northeast Institute of Advanced Natural Healing in the furtherance of a scheme to defraud. The following purchases took place after Curran had seen ML, TFA Faella and PI Correia. 113. On August 26, 2004 and September 29, 2004, payments, each in the amount of $5,046.61, were made to Practice Builder Business Services. The investigation has revealed that Practice Builder Business Services is a company engaged in providing medical practices with strategic marketing services. The company provides, among other services, web design and strategies, company promotional design, typesetting and placement and mailing and physician and patient retaining and referral building. 114. On September 3, 2004, a payment of $19,190.00 was made to BioMeridian Inc., located in Utah. As stated above at paragraph 29, this corporation sells BioMeridian Stress Assessment devices, a device utilized by John E. Curran and described in detail in this affidavit. 115. Numerous payments have been made to Chi's Enterprise, a corporation that the investigation has revealed is engaged in the sale of herbal supplements. The payments include a payment was charged in the amount of $728.00 on August 17, 2004. IX. Computer Search Issues 116. As used in the Affidavit, the term \"computer\" includes \"computer software and memory,\" which refers to digital information that can be interpreted by a computer and any of its related components to direct the way they work. Software is stored in electronic, magnetic, optical, or other digital form. It commonly includes programs to run operating systems, applications (such as word-processing, graphics, or spreadsheet programs). 117. Based upon my training, experience, participation in other fraud and drug investigations, and discussions with other law enforcement officers experienced in the use and retrieval of computer-generated information, I am aware that computer storage devices (like hard disks, floppy disks, tapes, laser disks, and Bernoulli (drives) can store the equivalent of thousands of pages of information. Additionally, a person engaged in fraud may try to conceal criminal evidence, such as by storing it in random order with deceptive file names. This may require the qualified computer experts to examine all the stored data to determine which particular files are evidence or instrumentalities of crime. 118. During the course of this investigation, your affiant has consulted with other Special Agents, including FDA SA Special Agent Phil Walsky. SA Walsky has been a Special Agent with FDA for six years. Prior to FDA, SA Walsky was a special agent with the United States Secret Service. SA Walsky has been performing computer forensics since 1997, when he received computer forensics examination training and certification while he was with the Secret Service. He has continued to perform computer forensics as a Special Agent for the FDA's Office of Criminal Investigation. SA Walsky has received training and has gained experience in the usage of specialized computer software and hardware which assists him in examining seized computers. He performs dozens of computer forensic exams a year. The training SA Walsky has received includes Seized Computer Evidence Recovery (SCERS) training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, in Georgia in1997, and numerous continuing training over the following years. This continuing training covers various topics of computer forensics investigations such as legal issues, software and hardware components, internet and email dynamics, and other computer related topics. He has received additional training for various forensic software and hardware tools that I use for computer examinations. 119. Based on your affiant's experience in fraud investigations, consultation with other special agents and discussions with Special Agent Walsky, your affiant knows that computer files or remnants of such files can be recovered months or even years after they have been downloaded onto a hard drive, deleted or viewed via the Internet. Electronic files downloaded to a hard drive can be stored for years at little or no cost. Even when such files have been deleted, they can be recovered months or years later using readily-available forensics tools. When a person \"deletes\" a file on a computer, the data contained in the file does not actually disappear; rather, that data. remains on the hard drive until it is overwritten by new data. Therefore, deleted files, or remnants of deleted files, may reside in free space or slack space - that is, in space on the hard drive that is not allocated to an active file or that is unused after a file has been allocated to a set block of storage space - for long periods of time before they are overwritten. In addition, a computer's operating system may also keep a record of deleted data in a \"swap\" or \"recovery\" file. Similarly, files that have been viewed via the Internet are automatically downloaded into a temporary Internet directory or \"cache.\" The browser typically maintains a fixed amount of hard drive space devoted to these files, and the files are only overwritten as they are replaced with more recently viewed Internet pages. Thus, the ability to retrieve residue of an electronic file from a hard drive depends less on when the file was downloaded or viewed than on a particular user's operating system, storage capacity, and computer habits. 120. Also based on discussions with Special Agent Walsky, your affiant knows that computer hardware, software, and electronic files may be important to a criminal investigation in two distinct ways: (1) the objects themselves may be contraband, evidence, instrumentalities, or fruits of crime, an/or (2) the objects may be used as storage devices that contain contraband, evidence, instrumentalities, or fruits of crime in the form of electronic data. Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits the government to search for and seize computer hardware, software, and electronic files that are evidence of crime, contraband, instrumentalities of crime, and/or fruits of crime. In this case, the warrant application requests permission to search and seize records that may be stored on a computer. These records constitute evidence of crime, and your affiant believes that, in this case, the computer hardware is a container for this evidence. This affidavit also requests permission to seize the computer hardware that may contain the records if it becomes necessary for reasons of practicality to remove the hardware and conduct a search off-site. 121. Based upon discussions with Special Agent Walsky, your affiant knows that searching and seizing information from computers often requires agents to seize most or all electronic storage devices (along with related peripherals) to be searched later by a qualified computer expert in a laboratory or other controlled environment. This is true because of the following: a. The volume of evidence. Computer storage devices (like hard disks, diskettes, tapes, laser disks) can store the equivalent of millions of information. Additionally, a 'suspect may try to conceal criminal evidence; he or she might store it in random order with deceptive file names. This may require searching authorities to examine all the stored data to determine which particular files are evidence or instrumentalities of crime. This sorting process can take weeks or months, depending on the volume of data stored, and it would be impractical and invasive to attempt this kind of data search on-site. b. Technical Requirements. Searching computer systems for criminal evidence is a highly technical process requiring expert skill and a properly controlled environment. The vast array of computer hardware and software available requires even computer experts to specialize in some systems and applications, so it is difficult to know before a search which expert is qualified to analyze the system and its data. In any event, however, data search protocols are exacting scientific procedures designed to protect the integrity of the ' evidence and to recover even \"hidden,\" erased, compressed, password-protected, or encrypted files. Because computer evidence is vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional modification or destruction (both from external sources or from destructive code imbedded in the system as a 'booby trap\"), a controlled environment may be necessary to complete an accurate analysis. Further, such searches often require the seizure of most or all of a computer system's input/output peripheral devices, related software, documentation, and data security devices (including passwords) so that a qualified computer expert can accurately retrieve the system's data in a laboratory or other controlled environment. 122. Your affiant recognizes that the computer(s) located at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, R.I. may be used by functioning companies, and that a seizure of the computers may have the unintended and undesired effect of limiting the companies' ability to engage in business. In response to these concerns, the agents who execute the search will take an incremental approach to minimize the inconvenience to any legitimate business that may be occurring at this address and to minimize the need to seize equipment and data. This incremental approach, which will be explained to all of the agents on the search team before the search is executed, will proceed as follows: a. Upon arriving at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, the agents will attempt to create, while at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, an electronic \"image\" of the information stored on the computer(s). Generally speaking, imaging is the taking of a complete electronic picture of the computer's data, including all hidden sectors and deleted files. Imaging a computer permits the agents to obtain an exact copy of the computer's stored data without actually seizing the computer hardware. The computer expert or another technical expert will then conduct an off-site search for the computer files described in the warrant from the \"mirror image\" copy at a later date. If the computer expert successfully images the computers, the agents will not conduct any additional search or seizure of the computers. b. If \"imaging\" on-site proves impractical, or even impossible for technical reasons, then the agents will seize those components of the computer system that the computer expert believes must be seized to permit the agents to locate the computer files described in the warrant at an off-site location. The components will be seized and taken in to the custody of law enforcement agents. If employees of One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, so request, the computer expert will, to the extent practicable, attempt to provide the employees with copies of any files that may be necessary or important to the continuing function of legitimate business. If, after inspecting the computers, the analyst determines that some or all of this equipment is no longer necessary to retrieve and preserve the evidence, the government will return it within a reasonable time. CONCLUSION 123. Based on the foregoing, including: (1) the purported diagnoses that patients had abnormalities in their blood, including parasites; (2) the efforts to sell products to the patients, such as the green drink and E-water, and misrepresentations regarding their development and potential; (3) the undercover operations that showed that Curran had falsely diagnosed the conditions of the undercover agents; (4) the patient complaints and summaries; (5) the medical opinions that indicate that parasites in the blood should only occur in patients with malaria, a disease not present in this geographical area; (6) Curran's statements to Glen Lynch that he could not deposit cash in amounts greater than $10,000 at a bank and the he intended to \"make a couple of million bucks and get out;\" (7) Curran's use of interstate wires to conduct financial transactions resulting from his scheme; and, (8) Curran's use of the mails to respond to and deflect inquiries from the RJDOH regarding patient complaints, I believe that probable cause exists that John E. Curran, through his activities at The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing, One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island has engaged in the following illegal activity: (1) Mail Fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341; and (2) Wire Fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. 124. Based upon the foregoing, including: (1) the deposits of fraudulently obtained proceeds into Citizen's Bank Account No. 1452-751-0; (2) the use of the funds in the Citizen's Bank account to pay American Express Business Platinum Card, Account No. 3727-150577- 83006, bills addressed to Dr. John E. Curran/The Northeast Institute; (3) and the charging of expenses intended to promote the scheme to the American Express account, I believe that probable cause exists that John E. Curran, through his activities at The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing, One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island, has conducted financial transactions involving the proceeds of the specified unlawful activities of mail fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343), with the intent to promote the carrying on of said specified unlawful activities, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(l)(A)(i). 125. I further believe, based on the foregoing facts and circumstances, there is probable cause to believe that evidence, fruits, any instrumentalities of illegal activity by John Curran, as more fully described in Attachment B, are presently located on the premises at One Richmond Square, Suite 310-E, Providence, Rhode Island, at the office and principal place of business of The Northeastern Institute for Advanced Natural Healing. I respectfully request that the Court issue a search warrant for those premises as described in Attachment A, authorizing seizure of items described in Attachment B, which I incorporated by reference as though fully set forth in the Affidavit. 126. Based upon the above information, there is also probable cause to believe that Citizen's Bank Account No. 1452-751-0 is being used with the intent to promote the carrying on of the specified unlawful activities of mail fraud (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341) and wire fraud (18 U.S.C. in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(l)(A)(i), and that said account contains the traceable proceeds from the above violations. Thus, all funds in this account are forfeitable to the United States pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956, or constitute property traceable to such property. JASON A.

I love to read articles that tell me, a current third year student at Parker, about how inferior our experience clinically speaking is in comparisson to medical students. Before graduation I have to have a minimum of 1000 hours in the clinics and 350 adjustments. On staff at Parker College of Chiropracitc is a M.D., Neurosurgeon, Osteopath, Dentist, Exercise Physiologist, several Radiologist and even a Registered nurse. I have three friends who are currently enrolled in medical school, two of whom are on rotations and finishing up, congragulations lady, and they too laugh at your site. I don't know if you have taken a look at the Chiropractic cirriculum lately but all for all we are as qualified and even more qualified to diagnose and treat patients. I am currenly in clinical rotation and I have only two LOW BACK PAIN patients, that's right two. My other patients are diabetics, cancer patients, fibromyaligia patients, stroke survivors, CPPD patients and the list goes on and on. You talk about curing diabetes but when was the last time that a M.D. did that. The first thing that your generic general practitioners tell a patient is to change their diet and exercise, sounds a lot like what we are taught to say in school. When was the last time that you restored limb paralysis inflicted by a stroke, you don't but Chiropractic has been able to help these patients regain the usage of these crippled limbs. When was the last time that you talked about the affects, the real ones, of vaccines or the infamous flu shot which all in all is worthless and I got that from the lips of my three medical school friends and my general practitioner. I believe that all Doctors have a scope of practice and should remain within it. Chiropractors are more than back and neck pain doctors just as M.D.'s want to be more than prescription writers. We all just want to see the patient get better. Don't even try to throw in that crap about strokes, my friend had one and she is only thirty four, has never been adjusted, and it was caused from a drug that was prescribed to her by her General Practitioner. In the medical profession you don't even respect General Practitioners because most specialist say that they are not trained enough, once again from the lips of a M.D.. I take more radiology and work on more cadavers than any medical student I have every met. I also have four M.D.'s that were sceptics that now not only come in themselves for care but also bring their famalies. Doctors of Osteopath attempt to \"manipulate the spine\" but are not nearly as qualified as a Chiropractor. You know that it works and we know that drugs don't that is why hundreds of them each year don't reach the shelf and even more are pulled off the shelf. You were right to say that Chiropractic students are brainwashed we are, and so is the public in thinking that one day man will create a pill that will solve all of our problems. We are over-prescribed, over-dependant and most of all under-educated about the power of the body. How many pills do you take a day? How many do you spoon feed to your children and grandchildren? I bet not nearly as many as you push and peddle to others. I have met too many M.D.'s that don't even take asprin but will tell a patient in a heart beat that they should. You are the only profession that is liscensed to kill. Chiropractic kills fewer people than vaccines, fewer than adverse drug reactions, fewer than complications from surgery, fewer than the bacteria and viruses that lurk the halls of your hospitals. Argue with me on that and I will produce mountains of your own research that will back me up. I love a good fight and pound for pound Chiropractic wins. I am proud to walk up to anyone and explain the power of Chirpractic. I love my profession and for you to maintain a website that is so \"researched\" you seem to love it too. |Shandria A. Kelly | Third-year student Parker College of Chiropractic [Hide Full Content](#four-thousand-one-hundred-seventy-three) [Disciplinary Action against Bruce Rind, M.D.](https://quackwatch.org/cases/board/med/rind/) In December 2000, the Maryland Board of Physicians concluded that Bruce Rind, M.D., who now practices in Washington, D.C. , had failed to meet appropriate standards for delivering quality medical care; failed to keep adequate medical records on ten patients; wilfully submitted false insurance statements to collect fees for services not provided for nine patients; was guilty of unprofessional conduct; and had falsely represented himself as a registered acupuncturist. Rind was ordered to pay an $8,000 penalty and placed on probation for 18 months. IN THE MATTER OF BRUCE RIND, M.D. Respondent License Number: D37186 BEFORE THE STATE BOARD OF PHYSICIAN QUALITY ASSURANCE Case Number: 98-0507 CONSENT ORDER PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND The State of Maryland Board of Physician Quality Assurance (the \"Board\"), on December 15,1999, voted ...

IN THE MATTER OF BRUCE RIND, M.D. Respondent License Number: D37186 BEFORE THE STATE BOARD OF PHYSICIAN QUALITY ASSURANCE Case Number: 98-0507 CONSENT ORDER PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND The State of Maryland Board of Physician Quality Assurance (the \"Board\"), on December 15,1999, voted to charge Bruce Rind, M.D. (the \"Respondent\") (D.O.B. January 16, 1951), license Number 037186, under the Maryland Medical Practice Act (the \"Act\"), MD. CODE ANN., HEALTH OCC. (\"H.O.\") \u00a7 14-404 (1999 Supp.). The pertinent provisions of the Act provide the following: Subject to the hearing provisions of \u00a7 14-405 of this subtitle, the Board, on the affirmative vote of a majority of its full authorized membership, may reprimand any licensee, place any licensee on probation, or suspend or revoke a license if the licensee: (3) Is guilty of immoral or unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine; (22) Fails to meet appropriate standards as determined by appropriate peer review for the delivery of quality medical and surgical care performed in an outpatient surgical facility, office, hospital. or any other location in this State; (23) Wilfully submits false statements to collect fees for which services are not provided; and (40) Fails to keep adequate medical records as determined by appropriate peer review. The Board also charged that Respondent violated the following statutory and regulatory provisions which, in pertinent part, state: Md. Code Ann., Health Occ. \u00a7 14-506 (Supp. 1999) : (b) Registration required - Unless licensed under Title 1A of this article, a physician shall be registered by the Board before the physician may perform acupuncture in this State.

The Code of Maryland Regulations adopted pursuant to \u00a714-506 specify in pertinent part: MD. Regs. Code (\"COMAR\") tit. 10 \u00a7 32.15.03 - Unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine includes the failure of a physician to: A. Comply with the statute and regulations governing physicians who perform acupuncture, and includes representing oneself as a registered acupuncturist without having met all the previous requirements; and B. Be registered by the Board, or to have met all the requirements of Health Occupations Article, \u00a7\u00a7 1A-101-1A-502. [Footnote 2: \u00a7\u00a71A-101-1A-502 is the Maryland Acupuncture Act.] On September 28, 2000, Respondent was subsequently notified of the Board's charges by certified mail to Respondent's counsel, Alan Oumoff, Esquire. On November 1, 2000, Respondent, his attorney Alan Dumoff, Esquire, and Janet Klein Brown, Administrative Prosecutor, appeared before the Case Resolution Conference Committee (the \"CRC\") of the Board. As a result of negotiations with the Office of the Attorney General, Respondent agreed to enter into this Consent Order, consisting of Procedural Background, Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order, with the terms and conditions set forth below. FINDINGS OF FACT I. Background 1. At all times relevant to these Charges, Respondent was and is a physician licensed to practice medicine in Maryland. The Respondent was originally issued a license to practice medicine in Maryland on or about August 10, 1988, being issued license number D37186. Respondent also has active licenses to practice medicine in Virginia and Washington, D.C. 2. At all times relevant hereto, Respondent has maintained an office for the practice of medicine in Rockville, Maryland. [Footnote 3: Respondent's solo practice is called \"Center for Holistic Medicine.\"] Respondent's self-designated specialty is anesthesiology, having been Board certified by the American Board of Anesthesiology in January 1988. 3. On or about January 12,1998, the Board received correspondence from Blue Cross Blue Shield of the National Capital Area (\"BC/BS\"), informing the Board that upon reviewing ten (10) medical records and related claims in 1994, BC/BS determined that the services were \"outside the standard of good medical practice\" because the services rendered were considered by BC/BS to be related to the \"treatment of environmental illness,\" a non-covered service. BC/BS referred the cases to the Board for its review. 4. Based on the complaint, the Board initiated an investigation of the matter. 5. The Board subpoenaed records, including Quality Assurance records from Kaiser Permanente and from Private HealthCare Systems (\"PHCS\"). Respondent was terminated from PHCS in March 1998 because certain laboratory testing was not considered by PHCS to be appropriate or acceptable in the general medical community and the medical necessity of intravenous therapy has not been substantiated. 6 On or about February 5,1999, the Board requested the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of Maryland (\"Med Chi\"), or an appropriate component society, to conduct a practice review of Respondent's medical practice. 7. Thereafter, the Montgomery County Medical Society (\"MCMS\") Peer Review Committee conducted a peer review. Two Board certified physicians, one in anesthesiology and one in internal medicine. reviewed thirteen (13) randomly selected medical records of Respondent's patients, the 1998 letter from BC/BS, and a July 10, 1998 letter of response written by Respondent's attorney on Respondent's behalf, and determined that the standard of quality care was not met and the medical records documentation was not adequate in twelve (12) of the thirteen (13) cases. [Footnote 4: Fourteen (14) records were sent to Med Chi, but only thirteen (13) were reviewed.] [Footnote 5: The \"conclusion\" of the Peer Review Report states the Respondent breached the standard of care in eleven of the charts reviewed; however, the text of the report cites that the standard was not met in twelve of the cases.] 8. On November 19, 1999, the Board received the report of the MCMS Peer Review Committee. The Peer Reviewers noted that there were multiple deficiencies in caring for the patients reviewed which included the following: a. Not obtaining informed consent on a number of patients who were given non-conditional (sic) treatments. (i.e. intravenous vitamin and colchicine therapy and prolotherapy); b. Billing for comprehensive visits when, in fact, the Respondent's documentation included limited information with respect to symptoms and physical findings; c. Inappropriate follow up with respect to diagnostic evaluation for patients presenting with significant clinical conditions; d. Identifying complex medical diagnoses without supporting history, physical examination and/or laboratory testing; and e. Respondent performed acupuncture on two of the patients who were reviewed. II. Patient Specific Allegations Regarding Failure to Deliver Quality Medical Care, Inadequate Medical Records and False Statements to Collect a Fee Patient 1 [Footnote 6: Patient names are confidential and are not used in the Consent Order. Respondent is aware of the identity of each of the patients, having been provided a Confidential Patient Identification List enumerating each of the patients and their names.] 9. Patient 1, then a 59 year old male (d.o.b. 5/2/36), was treated by Respondent on numerous occasions between January 4,1995 and December 13,1995 for myofascial pain following a motor vehicle accident and for supra-nuclear palsy. 10. Respondent saw Patient 1 on an initial office visit of January 4, 1995. Respondent noted blank facial expression and restricted range of motion of the neck. Respondent's initial assessment was incomplete in that he did not note that Patient 1 had been in an automobile accident, failed to document subjective complaints and a plan of treatment. Respondent's physical examination was limited to an assessment of reflexes and a neurological examination. 11. Respondent charged Patient 1 $200 for an \"office consult, detailed\", or \"Physicians' Current Procedural Terminology,\" published by the American Medical Association, is a listing of descriptive terms and identifying codes for reporting medical services performed by physicians.] In 1995, CPT Code 99244 referred to an: [O]ffice consultation for a new or established patient, which requires these three key components; a comprehensive history; a comprehensive examination; and medical decision making of moderate complexity. CPT Code 1995. 12. Respondent did not document a comprehensive history; comprehensive examination; and assessment of moderate complexity to support coding and charging for performance of a detailed office consultation. 13. On January 4, 1995, Respondent diagnosed \"supranuclear palsy secondary to heavy metal toxicity from fillings\" without objective laboratory data of mercury levels. Respondent alleges that the diagnosis of supranuclear palsy was by history from Patient 1 and that he intended to \"rule out\" the diagnosis of \"secondary to heavy metal toxicity\" by a diagnostic trial of chelation therapy. 14. On June 26,1995, Patient 1 presented with \"mild hemoptysis\" (coughing up blood). Respondent alleges that Patient 1's symptoms were vague. Respondent's treatment plan was \"will observe.\" Respondent did not follow-up and obtain a chest x-ray or refer Patient 1 to his primary care physician for further assessment. On Respondent's office billing form, Respondent only noted a diagnosis of \"Mercury Toxicity.\" Respondent saw Patient 1 for a return visit on June 30, 1995 but did not document any progress note, including any follow-up of the hemoptysis. Respondent alleges that the coughing up blood did not reoccur. 15. Respondent saw Patient 1 on six (6) occasions between October 3, 1995 and December 13. 1995 for intravenous (IV) vitamin therapy without documenting Patient 1's progress, other than a brief note on October 18. 1995. 16. Respondent did not inform Patient 1 of the non-conventional nature of, and side effects and risks of, IV vitamin therapy, did not inform Patient 1 of conventional treatment options, and did not obtain Patient 1's informed consent to treatment with IV vitamin therapy. Respondent obtained Patient 1's written consent for oxidative (hydrogen peroxide) therapy, chelation therapy, and bee venom therapy; however, Respondent, did not inform Patient 1 of conventional treatment options. Respondent alleges that Patient 1 had knowledge of and had availed himself of conventional neurological treatment options. Patient 2 [Footnote 8: There are no charges in regard to Patient 2.] Patient 3 17. Patient 3, then a 51 year old male (d.o.b.1/21/43), initially presented to Respondent on August 23, 1994 with complaints of possible right ankle sprain six weeks previously. Respondent examined the ankle and assessed \"Iat( eral) ankle ligament laxity.\" Respondent treated Patient 3 with prolotherapy.

MECHANICAL NATUROPATHY will include all manual methods of overcoming lesions of bones, ligaments, muscles and other structures. We will not designate these methods as osteopathy, chiropractic, naprapathy, mechano-therapy, etc., as we consider such terms arbitray [sic].

MECHANICAL NATUROPATHY will include all manual methods of overcoming lesions of bones, ligaments, muscles and other structures. We will not designate these methods as osteopathy, chiropractic, naprapathy, mechano-therapy, etc., as we consider such terms arbitray [sic]. What is now known us osteopathy was really practiced two hundred years before the name osteopathy was known in parts of Scandinavia; what are now called chiropractic and napropathy were practiced a hundred and fifty years before these names were heard of, in Bohemia i and what is known as mechano-therapy today has been practiced in China, Japan, Egyt [sic], the South Sea Islands and other parts of the earth since long before the dawn of the Christian era. It is true, of course, .hat these various systems have undergone much development and modification at the hands of rather recent therapeutics\" but the basic principle underlying each system was not new when such \"systems\" appeared under the names we are now familiar with. Those old-time natural healers were in reality Naturopaths, regardless of what they called themselves, and those men of more recent times who have developed these \"branches\" were really making developments in the mechanical sphere of Naturopathy. We would furthermore like to have it distinctly understood that we do not consider that we have adopted any technic and applied the name \"Naturopathy\" to it from any present day \"system.\" We feel that the original research that we have done has enabled us to go back before the time of osteopathy, chiropractic, etc., to select the technic that we are here describing, and which we have \"woven into the wool and woof\" of Naturopathy. For that reason a Naturopath who is using this technic in his practice cannot be rightly charged with practicing any other system under/the name of Naturopathy. We desire to stress this point because some osteopathic, chiropractic and other State' Licensing Boards may attempt to obtain jurisdiction over Naturopathic practitioners, and we feel that that would be as unjust as if the case were reversed. Naturopathy is truly a distinct school of practice. It is in reality the oldest drugless school of healing in existence. It is no part of the practice of medicine, osteopathy, chiropractic or any other method, and the only kind of a State Board that has a moral right to examine a Naturopath to determine his right to practice is a Board made up of nothing but Naturopaths. We do not demand that medical doctors, osteopaths, chiropractors, lawyers, ministers, civil engineers, pharmacists, embalmers or members of any other profession submit their credentials to us to determine their right to practice, and we consider our profession so separate and distinct from all of theirs that we request the same rights that we concede to them. In spite of the high-sounding and conflicting theories advanced by each enthusiast of the present-day systems, there is just one thing that they can accomplish that will result in curing disease, and that is an acceleration of the blood stream and a consequent throwing off of impurities through the depurative organs. They may claim to do something\" else, but despite their claims, it is only as they \"purify the inner temple\" that they eradicate disease. MATERIAL NATUROPATHY will include all such methods that tend toward normalizing the supply of elements to the tissues of the body. As is well known, the human body is composed of seventeen elements, and it has been found that in certain diseases these elements are often in improper combination, or deficient. For instance, in tuberculosis silicon, calcium and iron are deficient in amount, anti if food is selected that will supply this deficiency, more assurance of a recovery can be had. As Hydrotherapy, Hydropathy, Hydriatic Treatment, or the Water Cure, as it is variously called, tends toward the re-arrangement of elements in some instances, we will for convenience include this method in Material Naturopathy. Some forms of electricity as used in therapeutics would for the same reason be included in Material Naturopathy. Particularly is this true of Galvanism. However, most electrical modalities have a purely physical or mechanical effect, so for the sake of convenience all electrical modalities will be dealth [sic] with under the head of Mechanical Naturopathy. PSYCHOLOGICAL NATUROPATHY includes suggestions of various types. It will be acknowledged by all earnest investigators that the mind to a considerable extent controls the functional activity of the body, or is capable of doing so. I will not go into great detail in this department of our Science, because so much that is impractical has already been foisted on a trusting public under the name of psychology that I do not want to exaggerate the offense. I believe that suggestion is the best cure of all for imaginary diseases, and that a cheerful frame of mind will go a long way toward assisting in a recovery, but when a tortoise-shell spectacled \"nice old lady\" of either sex tells us that We can eat decayed meat like a Fuegian, sleep in an air-tight hut like a Laplander, sew our underwear on for the winter like an Eskimo, wear three-inch heels like an American \"society lady,\" dance all night long like a \"sheik\" and spend our work hours with our ribs cutting into our abdomen like a clerk, and still maintain perfect health if we keep the \"right mental state,\" then that high-brow \"metaphysician\" and we part company. We believe in suggestion heartily, but we also believe in a common-sense combination of all natural, God-given agencies for the pro-motion of health and the cure of disease. We have tried to keep the Section on Psychological Naturopathy free from all fanaticism, and if some of our views are at variance with those of the reader, we will most humbly ask for your ||| [Next 2004.

The woman had charged that her neurosurgeon had committed malpractice by failing to inform her that a chelation therapy was a possible alternative to the surgery. Georgia's informed consent law requires physicians, before performing surgery, to inform their patients of the risks and of \"practical alternatives . . . which are generally recognized and accepted by reasonably prudent physicians.\" The judge ruled that the plaintiff had failed to prove that this standard had been violated.

In 1991. a federal judge in Georgia dismissed a claim asserted by a woman who suffered a stroke following surgery in 1989 for partial blockage of her left carotid artery. The woman had charged that her neurosurgeon had committed malpractice by failing to inform her that a chelation therapy was a possible alternative to the surgery. Georgia's informed consent law requires physicians, before performing surgery, to inform their patients of the risks and of \"practical alternatives . . . which are generally recognized and accepted by reasonably prudent physicians.\" The judge ruled that the plaintiff had failed to prove that this standard had been violated. Chelation therapy is not a legitimate alternative to vascular surgery. In explaining his reasoning, the judge noted that chelation therapy was not taught in medical schools, was not FDA-approved for treating blocked arteries, and had been criticized as unproven by the American Medical Association, American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and American College of Physicians. Even the doctors who testified as expert witnesses on the woman's behalf had admitted that chelation therapy is unpopular and not recognized as effective against cardiovascular disease by the great majority of physicians. SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA BRUNSWICK DIVISION JUDITH MOORE, Plaintiff, v. ROY BAKER, M.D., and NEUROLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF SAVANNAH, P.C., Defendants. CV 491-93 ORDER Before the Court is the Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the issue of informed consent. As explained below, the Court GRANTS this motion. This decision, however, does not dispose of the case in its. entirety. The Court has recently allowed the Plaintiff to amend her complaint to add a claim that the Defendants committed medical malpractice during and after the surgery. This claim remains extant. BACKGROUND The facts in this order are derived from the Plaintiff''s complaint and response to this motion. In March 1989, the Plaintiff, Judith Moore, was suffering from a partial blockage of her left common carotid artery, which impeded the flow of oxygen to her brain and caused her to feel dizzy and tired. She consulted the defendant, Dr. Roy Baker, an employee of the Neurological Institute of Savannah, P.C. (\"Neurological\"), about her symptoms. Dr. Baker tested Moore and diagnosed a blockage of her left carotid artery due to arteriosclerotic plaque. He recommended that she check into the hospital to undergo a neurosurgical procedure known as carotid endarterectomy to correct her medical problem. Baker discussed the proposed procedure with Moore, and advised her of the risks of undergoing the surgery. He did not advise her, however, of an alternative treatment known as Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetic Acid Chelation (\"EDTA Chelation\"). According to the Plaintiff's complaint, this alternative procedure is as effective as a carotid endarterectomy but does not entail those risks that accompany any invasive surgery. As explained in more detail below, the mainstream medical community does not recognize or accept EDTA Chelation as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy. A minority of doctors, particularly those who practice holistic medicine, do advocate EDTA Chelation for this use. Moore signed a written consent allowing Dr. Baker to perform the carotid endarterectomy on April 7, 1989. Initially she appeared to recover well, but soon the hospital staff discovered that Moore was weak on one side. Baker had to reopen the operative wound and remove a blood clot. Although the clot was promptly removed and the area repaired, the clot caused permanent damage to Moore's brain. As a result, Moore is permanently and severely disabled. ANALYSIS I. Summary Judgment \"[T]he purpose of Rule 56 is to enable a party who believes there is no genuine dispute as to a specific fact essential to the other side's case to demand at least one sworn averment of that fact before the lengthy process of litigation continues.\" Lujan v. National wildlife Fed'n, 110 S. Ct. 3177, 3188-89 (1990). The Court \"must determine whether there is any genuine issue of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Warren v. Crawford, 927 F.2d 559, 561 (11th Cir. 1991); Regan v. United States Small Business Admin., 926 F.2d 1078, 1080 (11th Cir. 1991) (both citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.s. 317, 322 (1986)). Thus, summary judgment is appropriate where the nonmovant fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\" Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322. The \"party seeking summary judgment always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\" Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323; see Brown v. Crawford, 906 F.2d 667, 670 (11th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 111 S. Ct. 2056 (1991). The movant typically must discharge this burden by producing evidence that negates an essential element of the nonmovant's claim. E.g., Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157 (1970); Clark v. Coats & Clark, Inc., 929 F.2d 604, 608 (11th Cir. 1991). Only after the movant successfully discharges this initial burden, does the burden shift to the nonmovant to establish, by going beyond the pleadings, that there is a genuine issue as to facts material to the nonmovant's case. Thompson v. Metropolitan Multi-List, F.2d 1525, 1528 (11th Cir. 1987). \"Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted.\" United States v. Gilbert, 920 F.2d 878, 883 (11th Cir. 1991) (citation omitted). The nonmovant must present affirmative evidence in order to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U. S. 242, 257 (1986); Gilbert, 920 F.2d at 882. This means that the nonmovant \"must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine need for trial.\" Johns v. Jarrard, 927 F.2d 551, 555 (11th Cir. 1991) (citation omitted). In assessing whether the movant is entitled to summary judgment in its favor, the district court must review the evidence and all reasonable factual inferences arising from it in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. E.g., Regan, 926 F.2d at 1080; Gilbert, 920 F.2d at 882. A mere \"scintilla\" of evidence supporting the opposing party's position, however, will not suffice. E,g., Walker v. Darby, 911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir. 1990). \"Where the record, taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the nonmoving party, then there is no genuine issue for trial.\" Matsushita Elec. Indus. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986); see Liberty Lobby, 477 u.s. at 252; Johns, 927 F.2d at 556. The evidence need not be in a form that would be admissible at trial. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 324; Cottle v. Storer Communication, Inc., 849 F.2d 570, 575 (11th Cir. 1988). The Court, however, must avoid weighing conflicting evidence, Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 255; Brown v. Hughes, 894 F.2d 1533,1536 (11th Cir.), 110 Tippens v. Celotex Corp., 805 F.2d 949, 953 (11th Cir. 1986), or making credibility determinations. Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 255; McKenzie v. Davenport-Harris Funeral Home, 834 F.2d 930, 934 (11th Cir. 1987). At bottom, \"where the facts specifically averred by [the nonmovant] contradict facts specifically averred by the movant, the motion must be denied.\" Lujan, 110 S. Ct. at 3188. II. Informed Consent Moore brought this action against the Defendants, alleging that Dr. Baker violated Georgia's informed consent law, O.C.G.A. 31-9-6.1 (Supp. 1991). Moore claims specifically that Dr. Baker failed to tell her about EDTA Chelation as an alternative treatment. The informed consent law requires physicians, before performing surgery, to inform their patients of the risks of surgery and of \"practical alternatives to such proposed surgical or diagnostic procedure which are generally recognized and accepted by reasonably prudent physicians.\" O.C.G.A. S 31-9-6.1 (a) (5) (Supp. 1991). Failure to comply with this statute \"may give rise to an action for medical malpractice as defined in Code Section 9-3-70 . . . and any such action shall be brought against the responsible physician. . ..\" O.C.G.A. S 31-9-6.1 (d) (Supp. 1991). A. Evidence Negating an Element of the Plaintiff's Claim The Defendants contend that Dr. Baker had no duty to inform Moore about EDTA Chelation therapy because that treatment is not \"generally recognized and accepted by reasonably prudent physicians\" as an alternative treatment for Moore's condition. The Defendants have submitted evidence, including Dr. Baker's own affidavit, that demonstrates that reasonably prudent physicians oppose the use of EDTA Chelation to treat conditions such as Moore's. In his affidavit, Dr. Baker states that he was never taught, in medical school or during his graduate training, that chelation therapy is a practical alternative to carotid endarterectomy. [Footnote 1: Baker Aff. at \u00b6 7] Dr. Baker went to medical school at the University of Alabama, and received graduate training at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri; Carraway Methodist Medical Center in Birmingham, Alabama; and Barnes Hospital, Washington University in St. Louis. [Footnote 2: Id.] In fact, Dr. Baker does not know of any medical school or residency program where EDTA Chelation is even suggested. [Footnote 3: Id.] To confirm his suspicions, Dr. Baker contacted Dr. Fenwick T. Nichols, III, a cerebral vascular neurologist in the Department of Neurology at the Medical College of Georgia. Dr. Nichols confirmed Dr. Baker's belief that no one at the Medical College of Georgia either teaches chelation therapy or considers it a practical alternative to a carotid endarterectomy. [Footnote 4. Id. at \u00b6 8.] A number of professional associations have voiced their opposition to EDTA Chelation treatment in this context. As the Plaintiff concedes, the American Medical Association (the \"AMA\") published a document in 1983 that concluded \"there is general agreement that chelation therapy has not been established as an acceptable treatment for coronary or other arterial atherosclerosis. [Footnote 5: Brief in Support of Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment at 3.] The American Heart Association does not recommend EDTA Chelation for. treatment of heart disease because \"the for [the treatment] aren't scientifically proven.\" [Footnote 6: Id. at 4.] This year, the American Academy of Family Physicians agreed that EDTA Chelation\" is not an established treatment for atherosclerotic vascular disease. [Footnote 7: Id at 5.] Both the American College of Cardiology and the American College of Physicians, noting the lack of objective evidence suggesting therapeutic benefit from EDTA therapy for arteriosclerosis disease, have opposed the therapy except on an experimental basis. [Footnote 8: Id. at 4-5.] Opposition to this treatment is based not only upon the lack of objective evidence that the treatment is effective, but also upon evidence that the treatment may be dangerous. In 1982, The Medical Letter, a medical publication, reviewed chelation therapy and concluded \"there is no acceptable evidence that chelation therapy with EDTA is effective in the treatment of atherosclerosis and the adverse effects of the drugs can be lethal.\" [Footnote 9: Id. At 3-4.] The Food and Drug Administration (the \"FDA\") has approved chelation therapy for the treatment of lead poisoning, but it has not approved the therapy for treating conditions such as Moore's blocked carotid artery. In October 1989, the FDA published an article entitled Top 10 Health Frauds. 23 FDA Consumer 28 (Oct. 1989). This list of frauds includes instant weight-loss schemes, fraudulent sexual aids, and quack baldness remedies. The eighth fraud listed is chelation therapy: Promoters of this therapy claim that an injection or tablet of the amino acid EDTA, taken with vitamins and minerals, cleans out arteries by breaking down arterial plaque (deposits of cholesterol and other lipid materials). Such treatment is supposed to prevent circulatory disease, angina (chest pains), heart attacks, and strokes and is advertised as an \"alternative\" to heart bypass surgery. Both FDA and the American Heart Association say there is no scientific evidence that chelation therapy works. Nevertheless, patients spend as much as $3,000 to $5,000 for chelation treatments. Not only are they paying for an ineffective treatment, they are also buying a dangerous drug. EDTA can cause kidney failure, bone marrow depression, and convulsions. Id. at 31 (emphasis added). As noted above, the Georgia informed consent statute required Dr. Baker to disclose only those alternatives to surgery that are \"generally recognized and accepted by reasonably prudent physicians.\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 31-9-6.1 (a)(5). The Defendants have produced ample evidence that EDTA Chelation is not a generally recognized and accepted alternative treatment for conditions such as Moore's. With this evidence, the Defendants have negated an essential clement of the Plaintiff's claim. See e.g., Adickes, 398 U.S. at 157; Coats & Clark, 929 .i.2d at 608. Thus, the Defendants have shifted the burden to the Plaintiffs to establish, by going beyond the pleadings, that there is a genuine issue as to facts material to the nonmovant's case. Thompson, 934 F.2d at 1583 n.16. B. The Plaintiff's Attempt to Survive Summary Judgment In response to the Defendants' motion, the Plaintiff has produced two affidavits: the affidavit of David A. Steenblock, an osteopathic physician, and the affidavit of Murray R. Susser, M.D. The parties also have presented the Court with portions of the deposition testimony of Dr. Steenblock. Both of these doctors support the use of EDTA Chelation therapy to treat conditions such as Moore's. Dr. Steenblock supports the use of EDTA Chelation therapy as part of an overall approach to vascular disease. Along with EDTA Chelation, Dr. Steenblock advocates changing the patient's diet to lower cholesterol intake, requiring the patient to stop smoking, advising the patient to take vitamins, minerals, amino acids, treating the patient's allergies, and reducing the patient's stress. He notes that this alternative therapy is much cheaper than surgery. He opines that surgeons, hospitals, and trade associations whose members are surgeons and hospitals, oppose EDTA Chelation because this alternative therapy would reduce profits of the therapy's opponents. According to Dr. Steenblock, \"[w]hen one can earn the price of a brand new European sports car for a half days [sic] work, one's enthusiasm for that work tends to climb and remain rather high, as would ones [sic] disdain for a new procedure which threatened to make such highly profitable work largely obsolete. [Footnote 10: Steenblock Aff. at 6-7.] Steenblock also asserts that, \"EDTA has been used successfully for many years by holistic physicians for the treatment of occlusive arterial disease. Footnote 11: Id. at 8.] He estimates that approximately one thousand physicians routinely treat occlusive arterial disease with EDTA, although he concedes that medical insurance companies who pay for cardiovascular surgery routinely refuse to pay for this chelation therapy. Moreover, Steenblock avers that several physician organizations sponsor educational courses on the use of EDTA chelation. The American College for Advancement in Medicine publishes a protocol for correct methods of using EDTA. The American Board of Chelation Therapy sponsors educational program's for physicians. The American Holistic Medical Association offers workshops on the use of EDTA. Steenblock does not specify whether these organizations advocate the use of EDTA Chelation specifically for treating arteriosclerosis disease like Moore's, or whether they advocate the use of this treatment for other diseases. Several pages of Steenblock's affidavit attempt to show that treatments once dismissed as quackery are now accepted by the mainstream medical profession. For example, Dr. Semmelweis, who urged doctors to wash their hands before delivering babies, was persecuted by. his colleagues in the medical profession. These doctors refused to believe that they could transmit disease from one patient to another through their unwashed hands. [Footnote 12: Steenblock at 17.] With this analogy, Steenblock suggests that the medical profession's current opposition to EDTA Chelation is misguided. The implication of this analogy is that the medical community may one day accept EDTA Chelation as completely as the profession has embraced the notion that diseases can be transmitted on a physician's dirty hands. Because the Court does not have a crystal ball, it cannot determine whether Steenblock's prediction will come true. Unfortunately for the Plaintiff, the Court need not make this determination. Georgia's informed consent law does not require physicians to inform patients of all alternatives to surgery, or even of all alternatives that the medical profession should accept. The law requires disclosure only of those alternatives that are \"generally recognized and accepted by reasonably prudent physicians.\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 31-9-6.1 (a) (5). Dr. Steenblock's testimony, in essence, concedes that Dr. Baker met this standard. At Dr. Steenblock's deposition, the following exchange occurred: Q: Chelation therapy is not a conservative, standard or recognized treatment recognized by physicians who perform endarterectomies; is that a fair statement? A [by Dr. Steenblock]: That's true. Q: Would that be true as well with cardiologists, neurosurgeons and physicians who perform vascular surgery, and cardiologists [sic]? A: As of this point in time, since the F.D.A. hasn't approved its use for vascular disease, the great majority of physicians, including those you mentioned, would not advocate the use of chelation therapy for treatment of vascular disease. Q: And they wouldn't advise clients of chelation therapy as an. alternative to surgery or conservative treatment with aspirin and other medications? A: I am sorry. Would you repeat that question? Q: . . . and that same group of physicians that we have just talked about would not include chelation therapy in the alternatives that they tell their patients about when discussing surgery? Isn't that correct? A: That's correct. [Footnote 13: Steenblock Dep. At 120-21.] The Plaintiff has a second expert witness, Murray R. Susser, M.D. Dr. Susser, like Dr. Steenblock, avers that Dr. Baker's failure to advise the Plaintiff about EDTA Chelation violated O.C.G.A. 31-9-6.1. Like Dr. Steenblock, Dr. Susser concedes that EDTA Chelation therapy is unpopular with surgeons and other members of the medical profession. [Footnote 14: Susser Aff. at 6.] The rest of Dr. Susser's affidavit is duplicative of Dr. Steenblock's affidavit and testimony. The Plaintiff has produced evidence that suggests that some physicians approve of EDTA Chelation therapy as an alternative to surgery. Drs. Susser and Steenblock believe that the medical profession should embrace this therapy as a viable alternative to surgery. Whether the medical profession should change its opposition to this treatment, however, is not the issue before the Court. The Court must determine the narrow issue of whether Dr. Baker violated the Georgia informed consent law when he failed to inform the Plaintiff that EDTA Chelation was an alternative treatment. Because the Plaintiff has not shown that reasonably prudent physicians generally recognize and accept this alternative treatment, the Court concludes that Dr. Baker did not violate the statute. The Defendants' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED. CONCLUSION Georgia's informed consent law does not require physicians to inform patients who are about to undergo surgery about every new experimental treatment that might be efficacious. It certainly does not require physicians to inform patients about treatments that the mainstream medical profession rejects as quackery or condemns as dangerous. Instead, the statute limits the physician's duty to informing the patient of generally accepted alternatives. The Defendants have established that EDTA Chelation is not a generally accepted alternative to the surgery Dr. Baker performed on Moore. Moore has been unable to refute the Defendants' evidence on this point. Because there are no material facts in dispute and the Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this issue, the Court GRANTS the Defendants' motion for summary judgment. As noted above, this conclusion does not dispose of the case. Still remaining is the Plaintiff's contention that Dr. Baker acted negligently during and after the surgery.

[Hide Full Content](#eight-thousand-three-hundred-eight) [Disciplinary Action against Joseph Py, D.O.](https://quackwatch.org/cases/board/med/py/) Joseph Py, an osteopathic physician who has practiced in Maine and Massachusetts, has been disciplined by the licensing boards of both states in connection with his use of intravenous hydrogen peroxide (IV H2O2) to treat diseases for which no scientific evidence exists that it is effective. The order below from the Maine Board of Osteopathic Licensure states: In June 2002, Py informed the Board that since April 2001, he had been involved a research study whose design had been approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the International Bio-Oxidative Medicine Foundation (IBOMF). Py said he understood that the IBOMF IRB was approved by the FDA. The Osteopathic Board was unable to verify this. Py used an \"informed consent\" form supplied by the IRB along ... Joseph Py, an osteopathic physician who has practiced in Maine and Massachusetts, has been disciplined by the licensing boards of both states in connection with his use of intravenous hydrogen peroxide (IV H2O2) to treat diseases for which no scientific evidence exists that it is effective. The order below from the Maine Board of Osteopathic Licensure states: - In June 2002, Py informed the Board that since April 2001, he had been involved a research study whose design had been approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the International Bio-Oxidative Medicine Foundation (IBOMF). - Py said he understood that the IBOMF IRB was approved by the FDA. The Osteopathic Board was unable to verify this. - Py used an \"informed consent\" form supplied by the IRB along with a form titled \"Side Effects of Peroxide Therapy,\" which stated that the treatment would \"quite probably improve the condition for which you are under treatment, and . . . your overall health.\" [FDA guidelines]prohibit overly optimistic representations. - The consent form also contained language that because \"(IV H2O2) is regarded as experimental . . . . we cannot and do not offer this procedure to you except upon the condition you do release us from any legal responsibility for harm resulting from use in your case.\" [FDA guidelines]prohibit any such waiver. When an organization designates itself as an IRB, it and its investigators are required to follow FDA guidelines intended to protect the experimental subjects. The FDA does not approve IRBs but has the authority to inspect what IRBs do. At the end of 1995 and the beginning of 1997, the FDA conducted inspections and found serious deficiencies with the IBOMF IRB. In June 1997, it ordered the IRB to stop approving new studies or permitting new subjects to enter any studies. [The FDA's letter]indicated that (a) the IRB had failed to maintain a membership of at least five members, (b) the \"chairman,\" a chiropractor named Robert L. Santelli, said that he was the only member, (c) the IRB files did not contain complete information about the studies that it supposedly approved, and (d) the IRB had not held most of the meetings required to review the ongoing studies. In other words: (a) the IBOMF IRB was a sham run by a chiropractor who accumulated a few documents but did almost nothing that IRBs are supposed to do; (b) Py's \"study\" began four years after the FDA suspended the authority of IBOMF IRB to approve new studies; and (c) Py's statements to the Osteopathic Board were either flat-out lies or demonstrate extraordinary ignorance about the basic issues in human subject research. The 2002 consent agreement restricts him from doing IV H2O2 treatment outside of a valid research project and would be subject to board inspections if he resumed its use. Based on Py's assurance that he would not use IV H2O2 again, the board limited the term of the agreement to two years. In July 2004, Py and the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine signed a [similar consent agreement]under which he could no longer use IV H2O2 therapy in Massachusetts. In 2004, after Py informed the Maine board that heno longer had any attention of resuming H2O2 therapy the board agreed to stop monitoring of his practice. MAINE BOARD OF OSTEOPATHIC LICENSURE IN RE: JOSEPH PY, D.O. CONSENT AGREEMENT AND BOARD ORDER The State of Maine Board of Osteopathic Licensure (hereafter \"the Board\"). Joseph Py. D.O., and the Office of Attorney General enter into this Consent Agreement in order to resolve all matters related to a pending investigation and Board complaint regarding IV H2O2 therapy and the pending application for license renewal. As a basis for this Agreement, the parties stipulate to the following findings: FINDINGS 1. Dr. Py is a licensed Osteopathic physician. who specializes in family practice, addiction medicine and environmental medicine and is Board Certified in Family Practice by the American Osteopathic Board of Family Practice and has been examined and certified by the American Society of Addiction Medicine. After training and certification by the International Oxidative Medicine Association (IOMA), Dr. Py ultimately treated 5 to 10% of his patients with certain conditions using intravenous hydrogen peroxide (\"IV H2O2 therapy\") as part of an overall treatment plan. These conditions included: upper respiratory infections,\"candida overgrowth\", chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome, asthma, influenza, chronic Epstein Barr Virus, Lyme disease, acute and chronic viral infections, hepatitis and colon cancer. 2. The Board has not promulgated any rules or regulations specifically related to alternative medical care or the administration of IV H2O2 therapy. 3. The patients treated with IV H2O2 therapy usually have previously tried conventional therapies, often unsuccessful1y, or sought IV H2O2 therapy because they do not want to be treated by use of conventional therapies. Dr. Py used IV H2O2 therapy as part of a broader treatment plan, and sometimes as an adjunct with more convcntiona1 therapies. 4. Dr. Py infused H202 (purchased from pharmaceutical companies specific for intravenous infusion) in a dilute solution consistent with protocols developed and recommended by the International Oxidative Medicine Association. In his experience, Dr. Py considered this treatment to be effective and beneficial for patients with the conditions identified in (1) above. At no time has any patient complained to the Board about adverse effects with IV H2O2 therapy administered by Dr. Py. 5. Prior to beginning IV H2O2 therapy with a patient, Dr. Py spoke with patients about IV H2O2 therapy and he provided patients with articles, materials and studies related to H2O2 and its administration. Additional, more technical materials were made available to patients whenever they wanted more information about IV H2O2, and he would also speak with patients about these materials and answer any other questions they had about IV H2O2 treatment. Dr. Py asked each patient to acknowledge in writing that he or she had read and understood the material. None of the material provided or offered to patients related to scientifically controlled. human studies or to the efficacy of this therapy for the specific conditions being treated, except as to one study regarding influenza. 6. Dr. Py informed the Board in June 2002 that since April 2001, he had been involved in an Institutional Review Board approved by the International Bio-Oxidative Medicine Foundation (\"IBOMF\") so the results of his IV H2O2 therapy of patients could be gathered and reviewed as part of a study. The design of the study was reviewed and approved by the IBOMF and its Institutional Review Board (\"IRB\"). Dr. Py understood that the IRB was approved and sanctioned by the FDA, which the Board has not been able to verify. The study did not involve a control group. It used the SF-36 Health Status Scale to assess patients. 7. In conjunction with the study. Dr. Py used an informed consent form that was approved by and based on a form that Dr. Py had received from the IBOMF IRB, along with a form entitled \"Side Effects of Peroxide Therapy\" (See Attachments A and B). The concluding paragraph of the \"Side Effects of Peroxide Therapy\" form stated: \"Question: If there was nothing wrong with you, and you look peroxide therapy for no reason at all, would it be harmful? Absolutely not! It would act like a tune-up to your body'\" The consent form did not specifically identify other conventional alternatives for the condition being treated nor did it enumerate risks of not pursuing other mote conventional or proven treatments. The form further represented that, \"1t is believed in your case that IV H2O2 therapy is proper under these criteria, and you will quite probably improve in the condition for which you are under treatment, and in your overall health from its use. However, you must understand no one can or does guarantee or warrant the results in any manner.\" 8. The \"Hydrogen Peroxide Therapy Consent Form\" that Dr. Py had patients sign before receiving IV H2O2 therapy under the IBOMF IRB included language that IV H2O2 therapy \"is regarded as experimental for the reasons previously cited,\" and \"'we cannot and do not offer this procedure to you except upon the condition you do release us from any legal responsibility for harm resulting from its use in your case. The latter requirement did not comply with FDA regulations pertaining to experimental studies, [21 CFR \u00a7 50.20](http://www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/informedconsent.html#general). 9. In September 2002, Dr. Py of his own accord discontinued offering IV H2O2 therapy to his patients. He has no intention at this time of providing this therapy to patients in the future. 10. Based On the above, the Board finds that Dr. Py did not demonstrate compliance with 32 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 2391-A(2)(F) by requiring patients to provide a release of liability as part of the informed consent before IV H2O2 therapy would be administered and by providing literature and other information to patients, in connection with the informed consent and the study that could have been misunderstood by patients regarding the efficacy of IV H2O2 therapy. Based on the foregoing findings. Dr. Py's license to practice osteopathic medicine is issued subject to the following: RESTRICTIONS RELATED TO IV H2O2 THERAPY If Dr. Py intends to offer IV H2O2 therapy as part of his medical practice, be shall comply with the following restrictions: . A. Dr. Py shall only offer IV H2O2 therapy to patients if he has them execute a consent form that has been reviewed and approved by the Board in accordance with Restriction 2 and B. Dr. Py receives written confirmation from the FDA that he does not need to be involved in a study or an experiment sanctioned and approved by the FDA in order to offer IV H2O2 therapy to his patients for treatment of a medical condition. Dr. Py shall obtain clarification from the FDA on this issue prior to resuming the use of IV H2O2 should he decide to resume such treatment. Dr. Py shall copy the Board on any communication to or from the FDA on this specific issue. or C. If the FDA confirms that Dr. Py needs to be involved in a study or an experiment in order to offer IV H2O2 therapy to his patients, Dr. Py will only provide this treatment to patients after he is enrolled in a study or an experiment that meets all the federal requirements applicable to informed consent, design of the study and is operating under the supervision of an Institutional Review Board that is active and in good standing with the FDA. Materials supporting this shall be provided by Dr. Py to the Board for its review. 2. Informed Consent Form for Patients Receiving IV H2O2 Therapy. A. No patient shall be asked to waive any legal rights in order to receive IV H2O2 therapy B. Dr. Py shall not make any representation about IV H2O2 therapy in the informed consent form that does not otherwise comply with federal rules for an informed consent form. Such informed consent form shall be provided in advance by Dr. Py to the Board for its review and approval. which shall not be unreasonably withheld. C. At a minimum, the informed consent form shall include: 1) If a study is required by the FDA, all of the elements contained in 21 CFR \u00a750.25 and any other applicable regulations. 2) If a study is nor required by the FDA, a) the patient's condition that is being treated by this therapy; b) potential conventional medical treatments and alternative procedures or courses of treatment; c) the risks of not pursuing other more conventional or proven treatments; d) that no clinical trials on patients have demonstrated the efficacy of IV H2O2 therapy for the patient's specific condition; and e) the reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts that the patient can expect from this therapy. 3. Monitoring. Dr. Py agrees that if he is treating patients using IV H2O2 therapy, an agent of the Board may make visits to Dr. Py's medical practice, or to the place where his medical records are stored. during regular business hours, in order to monitor compliance with the restrictions related to this Consent Agreement and that this monitoring may include the review of chart entries since the effective date of this Consent Agreement in a random sample of records of his patients who have received IV H2O2 therapy. Such visits may occur no more frequently than quarterly, unless the Board is investigating a specific complaint related to IV H2O2 therapy. The Board may make copies of relevant portions of the records and shall maintain the confidentiality of these records consistent with applicable Maine and Federal laws and regulations. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 1. Costs. A. Within one year of the effective date of the Consent Agreement. Dr. Py agrees to reimburse the Board for its investigative costs of $614.90 incurred by the Board. He may reimburse the Board in a lump sum or in installments. B. Dr. Py further agrees to pay for all costs incurred in connection with carrying out his obligations under the terms of this Agreement and for any costs that may be incurred by the Board in connection with the enforcement of this Agreement, in accordance with 10 M. R.S.A.\u00a7 8003-D. 2. Amendments. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, requests for amendments of any provisions of this Agreement may be made by Dr. Py no more often than every six months. A. The requests shall be submitted to the Board in writing. and supported by professional opinions, if available. B. Requests for amendments will not suspend any obligations under this Agreement Dr. Py will be expected to comply with the terms of the Agreement until his request is acted upon favorably by Board vote and approved by the Office of Attorney General. C. Amendments will be decided in the discretion of the Board with or without a hearing, and must have the approval of a representative of the Attorney General. There will be no appeal from the discretionary decisions regarding amendments of this Agreement. D. . Any action by the Board seeking to increase the requirements of licensure, other than in those instances already specifically provided for above, can only be taken after hearing or by agreement of all parties. 3. Violations. A. General If Dr. Py fails to comply with the restrictions or meet any of the other obligations of this Consent Agreement and Board Order, this shall be a ground for discipline and the Board may impose an of the sanctions or pursue any remedies found in Title 10 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 8003, Title 32 M.R.S.A. \u00a7 2591-A or other applicable law. B. Resuming IV H2O2 Therapy without Notice to Board. If after hearing or by agreement, it is found mat Dr. Py provided IV H2O2 therapy to a patient without first notifying the Board and meeting all the Restrictions related to IV H2O2 therapy imposed by this Consent Agreement, but no patient harm is found to have; occurred as the result of such use, Dr. Py's license shall be suspended for three (3) months or until such time as he has fully complied with all said Restrictions, whichever is later. If after hearing or by agreement, it is also found that a patient was harmed from the Use of IV H2O2 therapy, the Board may impose such other discipline as permitted by law. 4. Term of Board Order. This Agreement shall be effective so long as Dr. Py continues to be licensed by the; Board. This Agreement may be terminated sooner if all parties agree based on a change in circumstances. 5. Waiver of Right to Appeal Board Decision and Certain Future Board Decisions. Dr. Py waives any further hearings or appeal to the courts regarding this Agreement and the related Board Order. Nothing in this Paragraph will be deemed a waiver of Dr. Py's rights under rule, statute or the Maine or United States Constitutions, to appeal a decision or action taken by the Board subsequent to the execution of this Agreement, including other disciplinary action, except as Dr. Py may have agreed herein. 6.

Paces Ferry Road Suite 2000 Atlanta, GA 30305 INITIAL DECISIONThis proceeding was initiated on May 16, 1980, when the Consumer Protection Division, Law Department, United States Postal Service, Washington, D.C. (Complainant) filed a Complaint in which it alleged that Great Life Laboratories, Inc., 500 Dorian Road, P. O. Box 837 Westfield, NJ 07090 (Respondent) is engaged in conducting a scheme or device for obtaining money or property through the mails by means of false representation within the meaning of 39 U. S. Code \u00a7 3005. Complainant alleges in paragraph I of the Complaint that attention is attracted to the scheme or device by advertisements which are calculated to induce the readers thereof to remit money or property through the mails. Paragraph II advises that copies of advertisements typical of those referred to in paragraph I are attached to the Complaint as Exhibits A and B. (Copies attached hereto as Appendices A and B.) In paragraph III of the Complaint, Complainant alleges that by means of such advertisements, or others similar thereto, Respondent represents, directly or indirectly, in substance and effect, whether by affirmative statements, omission or implication that: a) The RNA in RIBOMINS will cause wrinkles to disappear. b) The RNA in RIBOMINS will make some individuals look ten to fifteen years younger. c) The RNA in RIBOMINS reduces breathlessness and fatigue. d) The RNA in RIBOMINS heals acne, age spots and other skin ailments. e) The RNA in RIBOMINS promotes good health and a general sense of well-being. f) The RNA in RIBOMINS prevents aging and disease. g) RIBOMINS increases resistance to flu and other diseases. h) RIBOMINS have been scientifically tested and proven effective in making the user feel younger and more energetic and have healthier skin. Complainant alleges in paragraph IV that the aforesaid representations are materially false as a matter of fact. Complainant then requests that an order conforming with 39 U. S. Code \u00a7 3005(a) (1) and (2) be issued against Respondent. In its Answer, Respondent denied each of the charges as stated in the Complaint, and with respect to each charge it further denied specifically each and every other allegation set forth directly or indirectly, in substance and effect, whether by affirmative statements, omission, or implication, in each separate paragraph beginning with the preamble paragraph of the Complaint and ending with the Ad Damnum paragraph thereof. The product sold by Respondent is a tablet called Ribomins, the ingredients of which are as follows: |1 Tablet 4 times daily provides|| | RDA* % U.S.A. |Vitamin A (fish oils) 10,000 units|| | 200 |Vitamin D 400 units|| | 100 |Vitamin B-1 (yeast & thiamin) 20 mg|| | 1333 mcg|| | 250 |Vitamin C (rose hips & other Natural sources) 300 mg|| | 500 |Vitamin E 100 I.U.|| | 333 |Niacinamide 100 mg|| | 500 |Panthotenic Acid 50 mg|| | 500 |Folic Acid 100 mcg|| | 25 |Calcium 600 mg|| | 60 |Iodine (kelp) 15 mg|| | 100 |Iron (ferrous fumarate) 19.6 mg|| | 110 |Magnesium (oxide) 200 mg|| | 50 |Zinc sulfate 90 mg. supplying Zinc 36 mg|| | 240 |Selenium (in special yeast) 4 mcg|| | ** |Ribo-Nucleic Acid 180 mg|| | ** |ONLY THE FINEST NATURAL INGREDIENTS AVAILABLE ARE USED IN THIS PRODUCT.| |Contents including base Made from fish oils, fermentation extract, rose hips, special yeast, vegetable oils, kelp, and pure vitamins and minerals as indicated in a base containing para-aminobenzoic acid 30 mg. inositol 40 mg. lecithin, citrus-bioflavinoids 100 betaine manganese and torula yeast.| |DIRECTIONS: Adults as a dietary supplement of various essential vitamins and minerals 1 tablet 4 times a day as a dietary supplement.| |* Recommended Daily Allowance as established by US Government. | ** Recommended Daily Allowance has not been established. In less detail Respondent describes Ribomins as a dietary supplement consisting of ribo-nucleic acid (RNA) plus essential vitamins and minerals. Four tablets a day are said to \"provide 180 mg. of RNA - and a whole lot more.\" (App. A) At the bottom of the fourth column of text in Appendix A, Respondent solicits orders for Ribomins, and offers a refund of the purchase price if, after 30 days of use as directed, the purchaser is dissatisfied and returns the unused tablets to Respondent. The purchase orders and the refund requests are to be sent to Respondent at 500 Dorian Road, P. O. Box 837, Westfield, NJ 07090. The following excerpts from Appendix A provide a basis, but not necessarily the only basis, for each of the alleged representations set forth in paragraph III of the Complaint. Representations- - a) The RNA in RIBOMINS will cause wrinkles to disappear. - b) The RNA in RIBOMINS will make some individuals look ten to fifteen years younger. - c) The RNA in RIBOMINS reduces breathlessness and fatigue. - d) The RNA in RIBOMINS heals acne, age spots and other skin ailments. - e) The RNA in RIBOMINS promotes good health and a general sense of well-being. Advertising statements- \"The 'No-Aging Diet' is creating a sensation. Recently, a national magazine and newspapers reported that a high nucleic acid diet can: - Cause wrinkles to disappear... - Make some individuals look ten to fifteen years younger... - Reduce breathlessness and fatigue... - Combat acne, ugly brown 'age spots', and other skin ailments... - Promote good health and general sense of well-being... - A major Health Journal reported:...The most immediate effect observed in dosages as low as 30 mg. of RNA daily was an increase in energy and well being. Reports disclose that the most striking effects were observed on the skin of the face. The first results observed were a healthier, rosier appearance and an apparent smoothing of the skin of the face. After one or two months of treatment, lines and wrinkles began to diminish.\" Representation- f) The RNA in RIBOMINS prevents aging and disease. Advertising statements- \"A significant breakthrough in the fight against the effects of aging.\" * * * \"Hailed by doctors as the scientific breakthrough of our time, RNA (Ribo-Nucleic Acid) is opening up exciting new possibilities in the fight against the effects of aging and disease.\" Representation- g) RIBOMINS increases resistance to flu and other diseases. Advertising statement- \"This safe and effective nutritional supplement may significantly contribute to your family's health and resistance to flu and other illness.\" Representation- h) RIBOMINS have been scientifically tested and proven effective in making the user feel younger and more energetic and have healthier skin. Advertising statement- \"If you are between 20-60 years of age, a major medical authority reports that RNA may significantly contribute to making you feel more energetic, may help your skin to look its healthiest, and may help to make you feel younger, more alert, and alive.\" In general, the hope of the reader as to the benefit to be obtained by purchasing and taking the product is fortified by the confidence and assurance of the seller as to the ability of the product to accomplish the advertised results. This confidence and assurance is made manifest in the banner caption of the advertisement stating that what is being offered for sale constitutes \"a significant breakthrough in the fight against the effects of aging.\" This display by the seller of its confidence in the product is undergirded and strengthened by the no-risk, money-back guarantee made by the seller. Complainant called as its first witness Dr. Theodore Robert Reiff, a medical doctor who is Associate Professor of Medicine in the School of Medicine at the University of North Dakota. Based upon his education, training and experience, including his private practice of medicine, as stated at the hearing and in his curriculum vitae, all of which reflect a special interest in geriatrics and gerontology, Dr. Reiff is well qualified to give expert testimony in respect to the issues in this proceeding. (Tr. 4-7, CX-E) Dr. Reiff, with what appears to be an excess of modesty, did not claim to be an expert in nutrition, but his credentials unequivocally establish that he is expert in (1) the mechanisms of aging and (2) the kind and character of preliminary study and testing that must be performed before valid claims can be made that products advertised and sold through the mail and over the counter will arrest or reverse the aging process. Dr. Reiff's testimony is summarized through page 20 of this decision. His testimony is adopted as part of the basis for this decision. The process of establishing a scientific fact usually begins with a theory or hypothesis which is arrived at by definitive reasoning. It can be initiated, also, by observation which leads to the formulation of a theory or hypothesis. Next, experimentation is performed in a proper, scientific manner which includes, among other things, proper controls and adequate statistical evaluation. The results of the experiment are then objectively reported in the scientific literature, followed by confirmation of the results of the experiments by other independent, objective scientists using accepted techniques. If the results can be replicated by others and if the information is of value, the knowledge then becomes accepted by the scientific, professional community. In designing the test or the experiment one factor to be considered is whether the experimental subjects are to be humans or animals. The subjects have to be of quantity and quality that would result in a valid experiment and be statistically significant. Unethical or inhumane practices are not be carried out in the experiment and the means must be justified by the ends sought to be accomplished, by the professional standards of society and of the individual profession. The process of having writings accepted for publication in scientific journals begins, generally, when the author sends a copy of the article to the appropriate journal. The paper is reviewed by the board of editors and the consulting editor. After appropriate peer review, if the research and the description of it are considered to be acceptable, in good form, methodologically and ethically acceptable, and scientifically valid, the paper is accepted. Otherwise, the paper can be rejected. (Tr. 8, 9) In discussing the process of the aging of living things, Dr. Reiff began by defining aging as a series of biological processes or events, including physical and chemical events, that take place, rather than just the passage of time. When aging is so defined, the question becomes: can the rate at which those processes and events take place be altered, thereby altering the rate of aging? The answer is: probably, yes. (Tr. 10) Theories of aging, or more properly mechanisms of aging, at various levels of biological organization were discussed. Some of these mechanisms are now summarized. A. The molecular level is the lowest level of biological organization. 1. The cross-linking theory is that aging is due to the cross-linking of collagen molecules, which are large protein molecules that form and help form the structural framework of the body. With aging there is an increased cross-linking of the collagen fibers in the cell. When this occurs there is created a mesh or network of fibers that entrap the cell and make diffusion of nutrients by the circulatory system more difficult. In turn, this collagen network makes more difficult the diffusion of the waste products from the cell through the capillary where they are excreted. The cell's metabolism is impaired and it becomes less viable. Here, in order to retard the aging process, it would be necessary to reduce the cross-linking process by chemical means since these are chemical cross-linkings. 2. The error theory of aging is that aging may be due to an accumulation of genetic error in DNA, which is the chemical from which genes are formed. Each time cells replicate there is, ideally, a complete replication of the original cell, but this is not always the case. There may be only a 99 per cent replication, which when carried through a series of ten replications, there might be almost a 10 per cent error in the DNA. There would result an interference with further replication because there might be enough error to prevent correct multiplication and cell division. An offsetting factor is that within cells there are certain enzymes, called \"endonuclear enzymes\" that have the capability of recognizing and correcting error in DNA. These endonuclear enzymes are thought to be over 99 per cent efficient. Despite this modification of the error theory, it probably is an important mechanism of aging at the molecular level. 3. The \"free radical\" theory is a third mechanism of aging. The term \"free radicals\" refers to reactive molecules and atoms. One way in which radicals are made by chemists is to radiate a chemical reaction. An incident of radiation can raise the energy state of an orbiting electron by having the energy of the photon added to it thereby making the atom molecule more reactive chemically. The \"free radical\" theory is that aging may be due to an increase in the number of free radicals that occur with aging and these free radicals cause a lot of unwanted reactions thereby accelerating the aging process. Efforts have been made to reduce the number of free radicals by giving certain chemical agents in the food of experimental animals. One such experiment appears to have had some success in pregnant rats, but it has not been established that it works in humans. 4. Another theory of aging at the molecular level is called the \"pigment\" theory. A brown, fatty pigment, \"lipofusion,\" is found in heart muscle, and other, cells and the amount of this pigment increases with age. Some recent reports indicate that certain chemicals may be given which allow the cell to get rid of the pigment. Experiments can be done that show that this chemical process works in tissue culture, but this has not been validated in humans. (Tr. 11-16) B. The next higher level of biological organization is the cellular level. Most cellular studies in aging stem from the work of Leonard Hayflick and the so-called \"Hayflick Phenomenon.\" From his study of connective tissue from the lung of a human fetus that had been aborted Hayflick found that the cells reproduced as normal cells did and that they did so for about fifty generations of cells. Hayflick, among other things, calculated that from the amount of tissue that would be produced at the time an individual is a new-born fetus enough tissue could be produced to last 150 to 175 years. In the past few years there have been reports that there is an extract of brain tissue, probably in the class of peptides known as \"encalfrines,\" which are chemical messengers for the brain. It has been reported that when this substance is added to cells and tissue culture it is capable of more than doubling cell replication potential from fifty to over one hundred. Thus, even if there is a cellular limitation to the life span for certain of us, it is conceivable that this might be capable of being altered. Dr. Reiff stated that this extract of brain tissue is leading the way to psychological control over the cell replication potential, or cellular aging. This may have a tremendous therapeutic potential in the future, but at present, there are no therapeutic aspects to it. (Tr. 16-21) C. The next biological level of organization is the organ or organism level, these being made of cells. About 20 or 30 years ago, Dr. Nathan Shock and his colleagues at the National Institute of Gerontology initiated a longitudinal study in which they brought healthy humans into the laboratory and studied the organ function in these people. They studies the function of the heart, lungs, kidneys, muscles, bone strength, nerve conduction velocity, liver, endocrine system and, lately, the immune system. They found that if a plot is made of the percentages of maximal function in relation to age, from about age 30 on, there is a decline from 100 per cent of maximal function in the twenties of all the organism function studied at an average rate of decline of one-half to three-quarters per cent per year. This has caused people to think, erroneously, that is why we live only threescore and ten years \u2014 that by the age of 70 we have lost function and can not continue to exist. The reason it is not true is because humans are born with a surfeit of function. Humans are born with two kidneys, but they can get along fine with less than one. They are born with an excess in the capacity of bone strength, bone muscle, strong lung function and heart function, all serving in good stead as reserve capacity. Physiological difficulties do not begin to develop until these functions are reduced to about one third of maximal. That is the time when one starts getting symptomatic with normal day-to-day functions and the level of activity. But from the point of view of the organism, there is enough function to last at least a century. It is believed that the reason for the earlier decline in organ function is atrophy, or the decrease of function or size of the organ with disuse. If one does not use it, he loses it. If one does not exercise his muscles, not only do they get weaker, but, also, the cells decrease in size; they have decreased RNA and protein synthesis. Conversely, it should be possible to extend the period of normal functioning of muscles, and other organs, by the process of hypertrophy, increasing their function and size. Therefore there may be ways of extending the healthy human life span by keeping people active physically, mentally and emotionally so as to prevent or delay the atrophic process. If so, nutrition is very important because in order to produce the hypertrophy, sufficient nutrients must be supplied to allow the body to rebuild and undergo the hypertrophic process. Instead of needing fewer nutrients because they have lower caloric and protein requirements, as formerly was thought, some studies indicate that older people may even need more of certain foods in order to allow the hypertrophic response. (Tr. 21-26) Generally, in the higher levels of biological organization it appears that the life span is increasingly shorter. The cellular limitations do not appear to be the limiting factor because there are enough connective tissues to last possibly as long as 150 years. If atrophy is not permitted to set in, there should be enough organ function to last in excess of 100 years. The Hayflick studies on cell longevity have not been done sufficiently on living people, they having been performed only in the test tube. Experimentation is in progress to determine if all cells are capable of 50 replications. In addition, the competence of the immune system has been studied during the last decade. There are some reports from the University of Rochester School of Medicine that the immune system is capable of being psychologically and behaviorally conditions. (Tr. 29-31) The primary causes of death in the very old appear to be infection, pulmonary emboli (blood clots that break off from the veins in the lower extremities and go to the lungs), and cancer. Infection and cancer are very much related to the decreased immunal competence, while pulmonary emboli are very much related to physical inactivity. (Tr. 32) Life is shortened by increased psychological factors reflecting depression, inactivity, and putting people out to pasture. Sociological aspects come into play - such things as pollution, environmental hazards, war and other factors which further shorten the life span below its biological potential. Much work is being done on this problem, but most of this work gives information that has to be used in the futre. Very few of the claims being made for treatment to enhance longevity have been scientifically established. For instance, claims that certain elements or chemicals, when added to food, are free radicals which increase the human life span have not been proven in humans. (Tr. 34-35) In testifying about the ingredients in Ribomins Dr. Reiff began by defining and discussing ribonucleic acid, or RNA. RNA is an element or chemical in the cells that is responsible for a number of things, including protein synthesis. RNA is produced by deoxyribonucleic acid, commonly referred to as DNA. DNA is within the nucleus of the cell and it is the chemical that makes up the genes of the cell. It is responsible for synthesizing RNA which goes into the plasm of the cell and synthesizing protein. (Tr. 35) When the RNA in Ribomins is ingested, it is broken down in the intestinal tract to its constituent parts, purine and pyrimidine, which are absorbed and are available for utilization in the body, for the building up of nucleic acids in the cells and for other uses in cells and energy metabolism. People who have an adequate diet are believed to obtain adequate amounts of RNA and DNA, as well as other nutrients. RNA and DNA, being cellular constituents, are found in organs that are rich in cells such as liver. They are found, also, in certain beans and nuts. Materials that are very cellular contain a lot of RNA and DNA. Individuals do not get enough RNA in their diets when they do not get enough food, or enough of the right kind of food, or if they are on diets that significantly restrict the organ foods or other foods that are rich in cells. (Tr. 36) The treatment for people who do not receive enough RNA is to give them proper nutrition if they are able to eat the diet, if their digestive systems are intact, and if they are able to absorb the nutrients. The diet should be a therapeutic diet which should contain not just vitamins and RNA but, also, all the other nutrients that are needed by the body. If someone is deficient in RNA, he very likely will have a protein deficiency. (Tr. 37) \"Cellular therapy\", which was also referred to as \"Sickle Cell Therapy\", a process in which ground animal tissues were given by injection to older people, was tried in Europe a number of decades ago. It was supposed to supply a lot of RNA and DNA and cause rejuvenation. The treatment was never scientifically validated and it was discredited by the medical profession in the United States and abroad. It is now in disrepute. Some people who received this treatment claimed to be helped, but these anecdotal accounts were never validated. (Tr. 38) There are certain conditions in which giving a diet that is particularly rich in nucleic acid could be hazardous. One such condition is gout which is caused by too much uric acid and when uric acid builds up in the body beyond its saturation point, it can precipitate uric acid deposits in joints, causing arthritis. Urates (salts of uric acid) can also deposit in the kidneys causing kidney stones and kidney damage. Also, if there is kidney failure, the nucleic metabolic products and the urates could accumulate and do further damage. If patients who have certain types of tumors, certain malignancies, including lymphomas, Hodgkin's disease and lymphosarcoma, are treated by radiation or chemical therapy, resulting in destruction of large amounts of tumor tissue, the urate levels in the blood would rise very high and kidney failure and gout could be precipitated. Persons with the foregoing conditions constitute groups for whom the use of increased amounts of RNA in the diet may be contraindicated and such supplementation should be used with care. It previously has been pointed out that the kidney function reduces at the rate of three-quarters percent per year after the age of 30, so that an 80 year old person might have a reduction of 40 pre cent from the maximum. (supra, p. 11) In treating older persons, therefore, it must be realized that they have decreased kidney function. (Tr. 37-40) There is no recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for RNA. Nutrition is a very important part of the treatment of older people. Undernutrition is a very serious and qualitatively important health hazard in the elderly due to inflation and the depressed economic circumstances of older people. Since they have to pay their rent, utility bills, and taxes, one of the few places where they can cut back on expenses is in nutrition. Nutrition in the elderly is becoming an increasingly serious problem of major proportions in the United States. (Tr. 40-41) Nothing in the scientific literature confirms that RNA, taken in Ribomins as directed, by persons not so malnourished that they have nutritional deficiencies, would make skin wrinkles disappear, or make individuals look 10 to 15 years younger, or reduce breathlessness or fatigue (except for a possible placebo effect), or heal acne, age spots and other skin ailments, or promote good health and a general sense of well-being (again, except for a possible placebo effect), or prevent aging and disease (unless there were a disease caused by a deficiency of RNA which was part of a generalized nutritional deficiency, in which event the patient would need other nutrients as well), or increase resistance to flu and other diseases (unless there was a deficiency in the vitamins and minerals contained in the product). There is no credible evidence to indicate that Ribomins have been scientifically tested and proven effective in making the user feel younger and more energetic and have healthier skin. From the foregoing statements it follows that there is no scientific evidence that Respondent's product, taken as directed, will have any effect on the progress of the mechanisms of aging described by Dr. Reiff. The foregoing testimony of Dr. Reiff is in accord with the consensus of informed medical opinion as reflected in his studies, his reading of scientific literature, and his discussions with his colleagues. (Tr. 41-44) Dr. Reiff has read about attempts by certain organizations and persons to promote RNA supplements and RNA plus vitamins as a great therapeutic advance. In his readings and discussions with colleagues the medical findings and conclusions have always been that these efforts have been discredited and that there is no evidence that these supplements have any benefits. (Tr. 50) The evening before the hearing Dr. Reiff read a book entitled \"No Aging Diet, Eat and Grow Younger\" by Dr. Benjamin S. Frank, of whom Dr. Reiff had not previously heard. A photocopy of the book had been furnished to Dr. Reiff by Complainant's Counsel, and so far as he was aware, Dr. Reiff had never read any other of Dr. Frank's writings. (Tr. 49) There are some weekly scientific journals which publish hypotheses and preliminary experiments. There are two geriatric medical journals, one of which is the Journal of the American Geriatric Society which has been published for many years, and the second is \"Geriatrics\" which has been published more recently. \"Geriatrics\" is not a classical journal. It is more of a news magazine type of journal, but it is read by doctors interested or specializing in geriatrics. (Tr. 53) Referring to his earlier statement that it is probable that medical science can interfere with the aging process, Dr. Reiff mentioned some experiments in which calorie and protein restriction in developing animals, rats and others, appeared to increase their life span. This restriction is not be applied to humans, however, because no experiments with humans have been performed. Many treatments that have been developed through practice are not being tested to determine the mechanism of their action and to scientifically validate them. It is possible that RNA has a place in the treatment of some of the degenerative aspects of aging and that it is worthy of further experiments. (Tr. 54, 55) The mechanisms of aging described as cross-link, error, error modified by enzyme, free radical and pigment are interrelated. For example, the free radical theory interrelates with the cross-link theory because cross-links cause changes in the oxidation by free radicals. (Tr. 57) The limited cellular potential is probably very much related to the error theory. (Tr. 58) Culture experiments are going on to see if human cultures can have healthy longevity increased by free radicals. It is hoped that in the next few years there will be sufficient information to determine whether free radical inhibitions may be a really important therapeutic modality. (Tr. 59) There are multiple mechanisms that cause or permit aging and they are all interrelated. This field is in scientific infance in many respects and there is a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done. (Tr. 60, 61) When RNA is ingested it is broken down into its constituent nucleic acids and it is then absorbed. If it is properly absorbed it goes into the bloodstream and it is carried to the cells where it is reconstituted and utilized in the synthesis of DNA and RNA. There is information to the effect that with advancing age and with increased atrophy the ability to synthesize and produce RNA decreases. The ingestion of more RNA will assist in alleviating those problems if there is a deficiency of RNA in the diet. (Tr. 67-68) Wrinkles are caused by atrophy of the subcutaneous tissue of the skin which does not then provide the supporting base for the epithelium which then wrinkles. Wrinkling probably is also related to: a loss of elastic tissue; changes in collagen caused by cross-linking and other factors; a decreased blood supply to the tissues resulting in less ability of the tissues to maintain their original shape and to retain their elasticity. (Tr. 72-73) In the book \"No Aging Diet\" by Dr. Frank there is a statement to the effect that ingestion of RNA will alleviate or remove wrinkles, but there is no credible information in the book that would indicate that there is any scientific validation of the statement. (Tr. 72) Most of the information was anecdotal information about what a patient said after taking the tablets. Such a statement is of little scientific credibility. Dr. Reiff is of the opinion that the hypothesis or theory that oral RNA therapy can alleviate some of the symptoms or aspects of aging has little merit, especially in terms of giving isolated RNA. In the case of an isolated deficiency of nucleic acid, if, contrary to the witness's belief, such a specific deficiency could be demonstrated, then there might be some reason to give large amounts of RNA. Otherwise, if there is a deficiency of nucleic acids the proper treatment would be by giving ordinary nutrients, or foods. (Tr. 75-76) Dr. Reiff concluded the major part of his testimony by commenting, generally, about the Frank book, \"The No Aging Diet\". He stated that there was no presentation of any validity to the claims made therein; there was no substantiation; there was no credible information that any of the claims have been validated. (Tr. 75) Arnold J. Susser was called as the first witness for the Respondent. Dr. Susser, President of Respondent, was awarded a B.S. Degree in Pharmacy at Rutgers University in 1955, and a Doctorate in Naturopathy by the Quebec Institute of Naturopathy in 1974. He is a licensed pharmacist in New York and New Jersey and he is the founder and President of the American Academy of Nutritional Consultants, which claims a membership of only 80-100, including members of The Nutrition Society of America. A more detailed statement of Dr. Susser's background is set forth in Respondent's Exhibit 1. Dr. Susser outlined the history of the development of Ribomins, the product which is the subject of this proceeding. (Tr. 92-94, 111) Dr. Susser defined naturopathy as a natural approach to health as opposed to allopathic care which employs drugs and medication. He continued: \"***it is allowing the body, by encouraging the body's normal, natural function with the necessary nutrients, to kind of heal itself, bring in the materials because, after all, our glands, organs and systems can not make things out of thin air. We have to make hormones, enzymes and everything else from nutrient factors.***\" (Tr. 94) In Stedman's Medical Dictionary, 23rd Ed., copyright 1976, naturopathy is defined as \"a system of therapeutics in which neither surgical nor medicinal agents are used, dependence being placed only on natural (nonmedicinal) forces.\" Dr. Susser formulated Ribomins which at first consisted of certain vitamins and minerals. To this mixture he added RNA, in order to provide (as he said virtually all experts would agree) for the body to form energy, or energy molecules, known as \"ATP.\" His authorities for foregoing statement are Dr. Benjamin S. Frank, previously mentioned, of New York, and Dr. Allen Nitler, of the State of Washington, who is listed, according to Dr. Susser's belief, in some San Francisco-Los Angeles directory. Dr. Nitler published an article in the Journal of Dr. Susser's American Academy of Nutritional Consultants. Dr. Susser describes the journal as a \"prestigious, nutritionally oriented, but still a very widely read, medically, journal.\" (Tr. 99) Dr. Susser says that Dr. Nitler concluded, among other things, that RNA, when ingested, is absorbed intact, or virtually so, even though it is a large molecule. (Tr. 99) The article adds, according to Dr. Susser, that more and more experts are agreeing that RNA in tissue and glandular substances, as part of the protein of the substances, does indeed become absorbed and can be recognized in the cells of the person who is absorbing it. (Tr. 100) Dr. Susser says that naturopathists use the words \"counseling\" and \"person\" instead of \"treating\" and \"patient.\" There are fewer than 300 naturopathic physicians in the United States. There is no licensure for that particular specialty. In his practice he sees people who are referred to him by medical doctors and he sees some who have been to many medical doctors but who need additional help. These people are given a form on which they keep a record of their food intake over a four-day period. Dr. Susser's nutritional staff breaks down the foods into the grams of proteins, carbohydrates and fats and milligrams of vitamins and minerals. Deficiencies and excesses of nutrients, including nucleic acids, are looked for as well as excess amounts of \"antagonists\" such as preservatives and chemical agents. The diet is discussed with the person and the environment in which the person lives and works is considered. If a report has been requested by the referring doctor, one will be prepared, and a regimen of dietary changes will be suggested. In about five years, Dr. Susser has recommended Ribomins to literally thousands of people. Also, the food intake of the person is adjusted to meet recommended dietary allowance standards, and if this entails the addition of more food than can be ingested, such supplements as Ribomins with RNA are suggested. According to Dr. Susser, over 90 per cent of the people he sees have a nutritional deficiency in 21 or more substances because of the effects of food processing and the promotion of junk foods. (Tr. 101-105) Dr. Susser developed the advertisement on which the Complaint herein is based on Dr. Frank's works, and on written materials which Dr. Susser had accumulated for a number of years. In 1969 Dr. Frank had written an article entitled \"Nucleic Acid, the Better Answer to Aging.\" In his article Dr. Frank mentioned the substances he added to certain vitamins, and he stated that the health of his patients improved in such matters as cardia function, retardation of aging, improved mental acuity, more youthful appearance of the skin, diminution of wrinkles and improved hair condition. These judgments of Dr. Frank were concurred in by Drs. Nitler, Lutz and Susser, and according to Dr. Susser, hundreds of others. It is Dr. Susser's reasoning that if RNA is involved in energy production, if the energy is increased within the cellular function, the efficiency of the function will be increased, and the food supplements will be more greatly utilized by the body. Collaborating with Dr. Susser in the preparation of the advertisement were, primarily, Dr. Frank and a Milton Pierce of New York City, as advertising copywriter. On a few occasions there were present, also, Dr. Frank's wife, a news editor of a radio station in New York, O. Miele, involved in the communications field, and Mrs. Susser, who is Vice-President of the Respondent. (Tr. 105-110) On cross-examination, Dr. Susser stated that in the American Academy of Nutritional Consultants and its affiliate, the Nutrition Society of America, there is a total of 80-100 members. (Tr. 111) The Quebec Institute of Naturopathy was accredited and authorized to award Ph.D degrees for some time prior to and including 1974, the last graduating class of which Dr. Susser was a member in that year. The witness stated that the reason for the closing was due to the fact that there were so few naturopaths in Canada that the Canadian government refused continued funding. (Tr. 112) RNA is present in all American diets, but to varying degrees. Dr. Susser has never found people who have not had RNA in their diet, except perhaps two or three persons who had either near zero or negligible amounts in the diet. These persons were primarily vegetarians. According to the witness RNA is not contained in the cellular matter of foods. The amounts of RNA contained in the diets of the persons with whom Dr. Susser consults are described by him as being either small or negligible, moderate or high. A diet high in glandular intake, such as fish, yeast and certain other foods, is recognized as a high RNA diet. A lacto-vegetarian diet is moderate to low in RNA intake, while a strict vegetarian diet is low in RNA. Depending on the individual involved, a moderate RNA intake may range from 3000 down to a few hundred milligrams of RNA per day, which is a wide range. Dr. Susser defined a diet with a high RNA content as containing 3000 milligrams and up per day, but he could not give the range of RNA to be found in the average hamburger. he did say that beef is low in RNA compared to other meats. A low RNA intake would be 50 milligrams or lower. If a person, as determined from a consideration of his or her daily intake, ingests a low to moderate amount of RNA, then the 180 milligrams provided by four tablets a day of Ribomins would be a judicious suggested addition to the diet. Even if a person had a significantly high intake of nucleic acid, the 180 milligrams added by four tablets of Ribomins with RNA would be regarded, by Dr. Susser and to most doctors who use it, as a safe and conservative amount, yet an amount that would be effective in terms of the production of energy factors in the body. (Tr. 111-118) Dr. Susser agreed with Dr. Reiff that no RDA for RNA has been established. (Tr. 121) Dr. Susser said, however, that humans do have a requirement for RNA. In support of this statement he cited Drs.s Frank, Nitler and Lutz and a release entitled \"Morbidity and Mortality, Reportable Diseases,\" issued by the County of Los Angeles Health Department for the Ninth Report Week ending March 1, 1969. (RX-2. This article speaks of the need for \"clinical trials involving interferon inducers in experimental and naturally occurring viral disease in humans.\" It also speaks of speculation that \"interferon induction might be of use in preventing tumor induction,\" but it is said that such speculation is premature.) With reference to his earlier statement that Dr. Nitler's article suggested that the RNA molecules are digested and used intact, Dr. Susser referred to some telephone conversation he said he had with a Dr. Howard Lutz of Washington, D.C. Dr. Lutz is reported by Dr. Susser as saying that he believed that the March, April or May, 1980, issue of the British medical journal \"Lancet\" contained an article in which it is stated that large molecular nuclear proteins, which Lutz called globulin, and which are larger than RNA molecules, which Lutz called globulin, and which are larger than RNA molecules, were found to be able to bypass the destruction presumably the breakdown into its component parts by the digestive process in the intestines contrary to the belief of the orthodox, or the adherents to the old school of thought. (Tr. 130-131) Among the weaknesses of the foregoing argument are that (1) the appropriate issue of \"Lancet\" was not produced; (2) Dr. Lutz did not appear; (3) Dr. Nitler's work could be found only in the journal of the American Academy of Nutritional Consultants, which journal, also, was not offered; and (4) Dr. Nitler did not appear. Although he is (or was) the founder and President of the American Academy of Nutritional Consultants, Dr. Susser stated that he did not know whether the journal of that organization is listed in MEDLARS and MEDLINE, systems for performing research in medical literature. (Tr. 134-135) One of the past presidents of the Academy founded by Dr. Susser is Dr. Carlton Fredericks, Ph.D in radio communication. (Tr. 142, 311) Dr. Susser stated that even if a person has a diet that has no nutritional deficiencies, and which would, therefore, supply all of the body's needs for the synthesizing of RNA, there would still be a requirement for exogenous RNA. (Tr. 137-142) Again, the witness relied on the works of Drs. Frank and Nitler. He claimed that support could be found in Respondent's Exhibit 2, but this exhibit does not deal specifically with the question put to the witness, or with the issues in this proceeding. Finally, the witness agreed that \"If it is a specialized situation with a person of exact stress levels of a known factor which is absolutely known hypothetically (sic), perhaps he will have enough RNA from his diet if he is absorbing it and making it on his own.\" Also, according to Dr. Susser, the providing of 100 to 200 milligrams a day, at a minimum, assures a person of receiving some RNA nutrient intake in his or her diet. The authorities for the last statement are Drs. Frank, Nitler and Atkins, the MEDLARS and the journal of the American Academy of Nutritional Consultants, although the studies that were performed by Dr. Frank have not, the witness agreed, been published in any reputable scientific publication. (Tr. 142-148) The next witness called by Respondent was Dr. John G. Ledney, an osteopathic physician in general practice, who lives in Richwood (or Ridgewood) New Jersey. he was graduated from Youngstown College, Youngstown, ohio, in 1962, with a B.A. degree and majors in chemistry and biology. He was graduated in 1967, after four years of study, from the college of Osteopathy in Kansas City, Missouri, by which institution he was awarded the D.O. degree. He was appointed to a general practice internship for the period 1967 to 1968 at Rocky Mountain Hospital in Denver, Colorado. Following his internship, he entered private practice. (Tr. 156, 157, 166) Dr. Ledney defined an osteopathic physician as \"a person who treats with an idea of the whole system, and his watchword is treating the whole patient and not in particular reference to disease only. He is interested in his financial, spiritual and emotional as well as physical well-being.\" Dr. Ledney is a licensed osteopathic physician and he is a member of the American Osteopathic Association, of Chicago, Illinois. (Tr. 157) The official definition of osteopathy adopted by the American Osteopathic Association is: \"That system of the healing art which places the chief emphasis on the structural integrity of the body mechanism, as being the most important single factor to maintain the well-being of the organism in health and disease.\" (The American Illustrated Medical Dictionary, Dorland, 21st Ed.) Nutrition is an elemental part of Dr. Ledney's practice. In keeping abreast in his profession Dr. Ledney attends seminars and he reads the current and recent literature in his field. (Tr. 158) For the last 15 years he has been interested in the practice of nutrition as therapeutic maintenance, and for the past five or six years he has put strong emphasis on it in his practice. (Tr. 158) RNA is one of the two nucleic acids in the nucleus of the cells and it is very important for the conversion of ATP to energy and in utilizing other nutrients in the production of energy. Some of the sources of RNA are fish, glandular animal tissue and yeast. (Tr. 158) When asked whether there is any correlation or relationship between RNA and extending the age and normal body functions, Dr. Ledney said that he believes that Dr. Frank's book is probably the most thorough discussion of that subject. He added that while he does not think Dr. Frank's work was scientifically documented or validated by doubleblind studies, he sees in his practice the same things Dr. Frank mentioned in his book, namely, that people who have a high RNA diet are healthier and younger appearing people. (Tr. 158-159) Dr. Ledney sees an average of 120 to 140 patients a week. The majority of his patients complain primarily of fatigue, followed in order by backache, headache, and obesity. Dr. Ledney became familiar with Ribomins early in 1975 when Dr. Susser brought it to his attention. he uses the product heavily in his practice and he uses it personally. If a patient requests a strong, good, safe multivitamin, Dr. Ledney refers them to Ribomins and has very good success with it. he has never had an adverse reaction when he has used Ribomins with an obese patient and on an overall basis 99 per cent of his patients have given a positive report of their experience in taking the product. They have reported such things as increase in energy, vigor, improved sense of humor and well-being; sleeping patterns improved; less depressions and changes in emotional levels; increased work output; less fatigue at the end of a full day and the requirement for less sleep. Other vitamin products have not produced the same favorable results and he attributes the difference in results to the presence of RNA which most other vitamin preparations do not contain. (Tr. 159-162) In addition to the foregoing results, he reported that the hair loss condition called alopecia areata improved; there were two patients whose eyebrows returned; and two patients came to him because some of his other patients had their hair return. In some patients their general facial expressions and countenances were brighter, their eyes were brighter, they were more alert and they could follow directions better; in some patients the general turgor of the skin improved. He thinks there is something about Ribomins that increases the whole health of a person and he believes that it is the circulatory system that is improved. There is a known need in the diet for RNA, but that need has not been quantified. Further, Dr. Ledney referred to a newspaper article in which it was indicated that RNA is directly related to interferon which, in turn, is related to virus protection. These are not validated reports but the curiosity of the scientific world has been aroused. When he is working nutritionally with his patients he sees less disease of all types and he attributes this result to an increase in the support of the immune system. He has observed in his own patients quite a decrease in susceptibility to colds and fever which he attributes to Ribomins with RNA, with which he has also had great success in treating mouth sores. Initial relief is quickly realized. The normal course of the problem is about eight days, but if he sees the persons when they are in the early stage of getting sick, and if they take this product, the cold sores respond within a couple of days. (Tr. 160-164) All of the patients who come to see Dr. Ledney can use some nutritional support. He does not prescribe Ribomins in all cases, but he modifies the diet according to the needs of the individual. If he feels that a patient will benefit from the taking of Ribomins, he prescribes the product. Dr. Ledney does not know how many or what proportion of osteopathic physicians use Ribomins with RNA, or any other RNA type of supplement. (Tr. 165) Dr. Ledney factors out the effect of Ribomins by means of his experience with them over the past five years of his 12 years of practice. He has not used synthetic vitamins to a great extent but he has used natural vitamins extensively. Synthetic vitamins are man-made materials sold by drug companies, while natural vitamins are made of natural ingredients. Synthetic and natural vitamins do not have different chemical structures, but they do have different biological properties. The basis for this difference is not known. (Tr. 168) The vitamin ingredients of Ribomins are natural. For example the Vitamin D comes from fish liver oils. Dr. Ledney's statement of the results obtained by him in his use of Ribomins is based on what his patients have told him and, also, on what he observed of them. His statement that 99 per cent of his patients have given him a positive report of their experience in taking Ribomins is based on the fact that it is difficult for him to recall one patient who has failed to report favorably on his use of the product. It is possible that the placebo effect accounts for some of the favorable comments he has received. (Tr. 169) Dr. Ledney reported that he observed increased resistance to colds among his patients. A cold is not the same as an allergy, although allergists might say they are the same. Many patients have a seasonal allergy, usually in May and August or September and, as he follows the patients during the first year, he sees less and less allergy reactions. These patients usually have been under the care of an allergist with weekly injections of different substances. He has gotten 50 to 100 patients off of allergy injections who have stayed healthy and have no allergic manifestations. He said that the fact that he noticed an increased resistance to colds is a fairly important scientific breakthrough, but he did not report it in scientific literature. According to Dr. Ledney if RNA is ingested, it stays more or less intact, it is absorbed intact and it then goes to the particular site in the body where it is needed. This statement is based on carbon-tagged studies reported by Nitler which showed that RNA was transported to the utilization site. (Tr. 171) While no need for RNA supplementation has been established, Ledney takes the position that there is an RNA shortage in all or nearly all people. He has no support for this position other than his observations in his practice; there are no studies, and no reports in scientific literature. He stated that the addition of RNA to nutrients previously used by him has brought about a tremendous change in his patients. (Tr. 172) One of the main problems of all people is their emotional state. He feels he is qualified to differentiate between a psychotic patient and a nutritionally affected patient. Some patients come to him after having visited a psychologist or psychiatrist. he treats them nutritionally and sees great results. He thinks \"the mental metabolism that goes on with this RNA and all the supplementation and therapy, the therapeutic regimen has made major breakthroughs in my practice which was, basically, not a part of my medical training. *** Most of my nutritional learning has been on my own, and the medical establishment does not treat maintenance or preventive medicine. It treats disease, and that is down the road.\" (Tr. 173) Dr. Ledney spends a good deal of time with each patient, but he thinks that the patient who just takes the product without having the benefit of his other consultative measures would be likely to derive the same benefits. Twenty-five to 30 per cent of his patients will not do anything else but take something by mouth. Dr. Ledney starts them on Ribomins and they get additional amounts of the product from other sources. He recognizes that about 25 to 30 per cent of the population achieves beneficial results by virtue of the placebo effect. These percentages are reflected in his practice. (Tr. 174-175) Martin D. Feit, M.D., who lives and engages in private practice in Staten Island, New York, was called as Respondent's next witness. Dr. Feit was graduate from Gettsburgh College in 1955 with a B.A. degree in Biology, and from the Chicago Medical School in 1960. He is a diplomate of the American Academy of Bariatric Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians. He is also a certified acupuncturist in New York and New Jersey. (Other items of note are stated in Dr. Feit's curriculum vitae, RX-3.) In his practice he specializes in nutrition. Dr. Feit described RNA as a substance which, when taken into the body, aids in normal cell metabolism and aids in preventing the running down of the cells. So far as the skin is concerned, RNA helps in the nutrition of the cell metabolism, hair growth, skin turgor, skin health, and the function of the other organs of the body. (Tr. 179-181) RNA is derived endogenously, being built up in the body, or exogenously, from outside sources such as fish, meat organs and yeast. Whether the body synthesizes enough RNA or needs an exogenous source depends on where the person is living. No quantitative requirement for RNA has been established by any medical group, but it is recognized as being essential. (Tr. 182) Dr. Feit became interested in RNA when he was Assistant Director of the Methadone Clinic in Staten Island. The instant product is not expensive and former heroin users could take it to feel better and to function better. (Tr. 183) As a person ages, if he is not health conscious, the skin gets loose, loses its color, loses its turgor, it wrinkles and the person physically degenerates. If patients are health conscious, or if they had taken a lot of RNA and other supplements all of their lives, there was a noticeable difference - seventy-year-old patients looked forty. (Tr. 183) Dr. Feit's practice became nutritionally oriented in 1971 or 1972 and he first knew of Ribomins in about 1974. Dr. Feit prescribes Ribomins with RNA for patients who complaint of fatigue and for persons who say they feel that they are aging too rapidly. In his methadone practice, there was a general improvement in the way patients felt and even in their mental performance. He has used Ribomins with RNA in treating obesity, drug addiction, and as a supplement to acupuncture for persons with alopecia areata. In terms of skin improvement, Dr. Feit found that after about a two- to four-week period, depending on how a patient followed the diet, there would be a tightening of the skin and improvement in skin turgor. (Tr. 184-185) The physiological process that occurs when Ribomins are ingested is that the RNA and vitamins go to the skin for skin metabolism. The elasticity of the cells would be increased, the skin would tighten and small wrinkles may be taken away. In addition, there would be a lessening of fatigue and there would be some relief from stress. Most of his patients who are on a proper diet, supplemented by Ribomins with RNA, do not get ill as much, the intensity of colds is diminished and the severity of flu is decreased. Ribomins with RNA builds up a person's resistance and prevents him from becoming sick or lessens the degree of sickness. (Tr. 185-186) Despite this endorsement of the use and value of RNA, Dr. Feit stated that the state of knowledge of his profession with regard to the requirement of the body for RNA, the role of RNA, and the body's needs for RNA, as well as other nutrients, \"is in its infance.\" (Tr. 187) In addition to nutritional treatment, Dr. Feit employs osteopathic techniques and acupuncture, the latter of which he has found to be helpful in treating lung patients. Dr. Feit has published papers in the American Journal of Acupuncture, primarily on acupuncture and nutrition, but none on nutrition alone. (Tr. 194-195) The next witness called by Respondent was [Robert C. Atkins, M.D](https://www.casewatch.net/depos/atkins1980.shtml)., who is engaged in the private practice of Internal Medicine, in the subspecialty of Nutrition and Carbohydrate Metabolism, in New York City. Dr. Atkins received his A.B. degree at the University of Michigan in 1951 and his M.D. degree at Cornell University Medical College in 1955. (Dr. Atkin's curriculum vitae is with the record as RX-5) Dr. Atkins has been working with diets since 1964 and with a full scope of nutrition since sometime in the early 1970's. Only about one percent of the practicing physicians in the country base their practice on, or emphasize, nutrition. Dr. Atkins said that Ribonucleic acid is an intermediary metabolite. \"Metabolite\" is defined in Dorland's American Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 21st edition, as \"any substance produced by metabolism.\" The experience of Dr. Atkins is in the clinical use of RNA as contrasted with the biochemistry of the substance, as a result of which he said that his answers to questions on this phase of the subject were less precise than he would have liked them to be. He stated, however, that the body gets the RNA it needs for its cells from the many precursors from which the various component parts can be synthesized. (Tr. 200) Dr. Atkins does not use RNA with every patient, but there are certain times, e.g., for persons suffering fatigue or angina pectoris, when he does add it to his basic routine as an isolated addition for the purpose of determining whether there is going to be any improvement in the patient's well-being. There are certain clinical situations in which he has come to use it, including fatigue that is not responsive to other measures, and angina pectoris. He began to use RNA four or five years ago, but more especially during the past two years, and he estimates that he has used it with between 100 and 200 patients. (Tr. 201) Dr. Atkins was introduced to using RNA through reading \"No-Aging Diet\" and \"Nucleic Acid Nutrition and Therapy\" by Dr. Benjamin S. Frank. (RX-6 and 7) In conversations with Dr. Frank, Dr. Atkins asked for what indications Dr. Frank found RNA useful; what complications or side effects RNA produced; in what dosage Dr. Frank used it; and for what clinical indications. Dr. Atkins then believed it worth while to try RNA on his own patients. (Tr. 202) Dr. Atkins does not particularly recommend sardines or other so-called high RNA foods, but he recommends RNA in tablet form as a food or nutritional supplement. He prescribes RNA for patients with whom he has started his overall program, which is a diet the main purpose of which is the stabilization of the blood sugar, and the secondary purpose of which is the elimination of any specific allergenic foods which that individual may be eating. Then there is added a comprehensive vitamin formulation and a mineral formulation based, in large part, on the epidemiology of the area and on the mineral results of the hair analysis. Occasionally, if the presented complaint is angina pectoris, the use of RNA may be started during the first week. More often RNA is withheld so as to provide a chance to evaluate the specific impact of RNA on that patient somewhere in the midst of the course of therapy. There is a solid core of patients - approximately between 20 and 30 per cent - who seem to be quite responsive to RNA. Their clinical response had been unimpressive with all the other vitamins and minerals until the RNA was added, at which point a dramatic improvement would take place in well-being; in so-called energy and sleep requirements; and in a variety of other complaints, such as depression, that seemed to accompany the fatigue. Upon discontinuing the RNA, these patients would slip back to their old previous level of not feeling so well. So, having taken these patients on and off RNA often enough he was able to convince himself that, at least for these individuals, RNA was helpful and did have a detectable and discernible clinical role. There were many patients for whom it just seemed to be part of the general improvement, or in whom nothing dramatic was noted that would cause him to believe that RNA was really making any major contribution. (Tr. 203-204) There were some other effects reported as being noticed very subjectively, which Dr. Atkins said he believed he saw, such as an improvement in the appearance of the patients. There is one other study, which should be, but has not been done, which is \"before and after\" photography. Dr. Atkins does believe that there is some efficacy in taking RNA because these people seem to look either healthier or younger or to have less lines, less crows feet around their eyes. Dr. Atkins stated that this observation is so subjective that it is an impression which, at best, would be very difficult to document. Dr. Atkins has prescribed RNA in ever adult age group including adolescence, but the emphasis has been on the older patient - the patient past the age of 50. (Tr. 204-205) Dr. Atkins described the state of medical knowledge of RNA, its uses and therapeutic value as being \"in its infance.\" He is not aware of any new investigations or information emerging. He said that Dr. Frank was certainly the leading proponent of the concept that supplementary RNA makes a difference. He added that everybody recognizes the essentiality of RNA to every cell in the body, but heretofore the feeling had been that we were going to be able to synthesize all the RNA that we need with whatever nutritional precursors we have and this is the currently prevailing thinking. It is only because there is the possibility of showing detectable differences with supplementary RNA that we might raise the question as to whether or not RNA production really has rate-limiting features which can be overcome by the utilization of additional dietary RNA. Continuing, the witness said that the question that really has to be addressed in order to determine whether RNA is a valuable nutrient, is whether or not our ability to synthesize RNA is not limited by the rate at which we can do it. Can we make enough molecules of RNA to supply our needs at a rate at which we might use it, or would supplementary RNA actually change the availability of it by providing so much more than we are getting from our manufacture of it through precursor nutrients? As to whether RNA supplementation might be beneficial to everyone rather than to those patients of Dr. Atkins who are put on a carbohydrate-limiting diet, it was his opinion that the carbohydrate-limiting diet does not play much role in whether or not RNA is useful. He has a group of patients who are on full carbohydrate diets and who take RNA and the same percentage of responders seems to prevail in that group as well. As to the value of using RNA supplements, Dr. Atkins is somewhere between enthusiastic and skeptical. He believes that there is a base for RNA in medical management or the nutritional management of some patients. On the other hand, there is actually a risk factor which had not even been talked about - the possibility that the uric acid level might be elevated. Therefore, he can not recommend its across the board usage, but he does see it as having a place in some individuals. More work has to be done and it has to be delineated. The right clinical situation has to be studied. In his opinion studying exercise tolerance in the angina patient would be a good place to start because one can document such a study. It would be quite admissible of a doubleblind study here, and he thinks such work should be done. (Tr. 205-207) On cross-examination, Dr. Atkins stated that he has published essays in Medical Counterpoint and in Medical TImes. (Tr. 208) He is, also, the author of two books entitled \"The Dr. Atkins Super Energy Diet\" and \"Dr. Atkins Diet Revolution.\" (RX-5) Doubt was expressed by a witness for Complainant, and no evidence to the contrary was adduced, that Medical Counterpoint and Medical Times were listed in Index Medicus, maintained by the National Library of Medicine to aid physicians in locating responsible, reliable, scientific writings. Both of the named publications are now defunct. (Tr. 229) Dr. Atkins stated that the American Medical Association, of which he is a member, has expressed a negative opinion concerning the diets described in his books. (Tr. 218) He conceded that the books by Dr. Frank on which he placed significant reliance (RX-6 and 7) were not subjected to the peer review and testing by which writings submitted for publications in authoritative scientific and professional journals are screened. (Tr. 215) Dr. Atkins is of the opinion that there is a certain risk associated with taking RNA by a person with a high uric acid (Tr. 214), but he is uncertain as to the degree of risk associated with taking Ribomins with RNA because of the relatively small amount of RNA contained in the product. A person could get 45 milligrams of RNA at one meal if he ate a lot of sardines or nuts or glandular meats. (Tr. 220-224) Dr. Atkins is of the opinion that when RNA is ingested at least some of it is absorbed intact. This opinion is said to be based on his observation of the effectiveness of RNA when given to some of his patients. He did not know whether RNA, when absorbed, is still RNA. (Tr. 213) The witness said that no RDA for RNA has been established - he thinks the presumption is that it is non-essential. (Tr. 221) Complainant called as its rebuttal witness Dr. Victor Herbert, 130 West Kingsbridge Road, Bronx Veterans Administration Medical Center, Bronx, New York. Dr. Herbert's educational background includes the following degrees: Columbia University, New York B.S., 1948; Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, M.D., 1952; and Columbia University School of Law, J.D., 1974. He is certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine and by the American Board of Nutrition. He has published over 400 scientific papers in peer review scientific journals, primarily in internal medicine, hematology and nutrition, particularly relating to patient care, diagnosis, treatment and biochemistry and physiology of nutrition. He currently is the President of the American Society for Clinical Nutrition, which is the arm of the United States in international nutrition matters. He is a member of the Joint Subcommittee on Human Nutrition Research of the executive Office of the President of the United States and a member of the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences. (Tr. 226-227) Other matters comprising the qualifications of Dr. Herbert, including his professional society memberships, editorial board memberships, consultant positions, hospital training and positions, intra-institutional posts, inventions, honors, lectureships, and memberships in organizations not requiring a degree in science, are stated in CX-J, which was received in evidence. Dr. Herbert defined essential nutrients as those which must be taken in the diet for life and health because the body can not make them. He defined ribonucleic acid or RNA as a chemical compound which is produced in cells, particularly outside of the nucleus of the cell in the cell plasma or cytoplasm, and it consists of sticking together of purine bases, sugars and phosphate, phosphoric acid. He has done research involving RNA and DNA and he has published a number of papers in that area. In fact, he developed a diagnostic test used in hematology and in cancer research which revolves around DNA synthesis, and RNA synthesis is also involved. There is not RDA for RNA. He is one of the fifteen members of the Food and Nutrition Board which created the Recommended Dietary Allowances and there is no RDA for RNA because RNA is not absorbed. RNA in food is chopped up completely be pancreatic nuclease, so that it is unabsorbed. If it were absorbed, it would be dangerous because that RNA which is not human in origin could be allergenic for humans if absorbed intact. \"It's chopped up in the gut and after being chopped up, the individual purines colorless crystalline substances forming the base of the uric acid group of compounds known collectively as purines or purine bases. -Dorland, supra, are absorbed and they then add to the burden of body uric acid to be disposed of as a waster product. RNA is made within cells; none of that which comes in diet is absorbed. The pancreatic nuclease and other pancreatic enzymes have this specific function of chopping up various undesirable substances so that they are not absorbed, only their end products are absorbed.\" (Tr. 227-228) Dr. Herbert pointed out that \"RNA as it comes in food, like in sardines, is generally not RNA; it's ribonucleo protein and in the intestine when the pancreatic enzymes start chopping up the bib molecule, they chop off the protein first and that leaves RNA, which then gets chopped up by other enzymes.\" Thus, what is in sardines is not RNA; it is ribonucleo protein, which is a much bigger molecule than RNA. Concerning peer review he said that it is the scientific system for separating wheat from chaff - that is, for separating, for example, a nutrition book for the public which may be completely fiction, from a nutrition book for scientists. The process of peer review involves the writing being submitted to an editor competent in medical science who then sends it out to a minimum of two reviewers known to be competent in the specific area of the scientific paper in question. These reviewers then do their best to tear the writing apart, both as to theory and fact and experimental method and conclusions. Their criticisms are then synthesized by the editor and sent back to the author who is not allowed to publish until he successfully meets the criticisms of his work. (Tr. 228-229) The membership of the American Academy of Nutritional Consultants is not composed of scientific nutritionists according to uncontroverted testimony of Dr. Herbert. He said, also, and there was no testimony to the contrary, that several members of that organization have been convicted of criminal charges involving nutrition fraud. This is the group of which Dr. Susser is shown as the Founder/President in Dr. Susser's curriculum vitae. (Tr. 230; RX-1) There is no relationship between interferon and dietary RNA. Dietary RNA is destroyed in the intestines. There are some studies which show that in tissue culture, if one adds a variety of substances, interferon production can be stimulated. One such substance which can be added to a tissue culture as an intact substance is RNA in certain forms, and in some tissue cultures it will stimulate interferon production. In other tissue cultures it will not; some RNA's will stimulate, others will not. * * * One can think of RNA as a necklace - that is, it is a string of substances strung together and that necklace is called RNA regardless of whether it is made out or pearls or diamonds or glass; its component parts can be considerably different so long as it meets the basic criteria of purine bases and sugar and so on, so that the RNA from a mouse, for example, can produce a fatal allergic reaction if injected into a human. \"***That's one of the reasons that we have intestinal enzymes to chop up our foods so that we don't absorb food RNA which is not human, except for cannibals, and get allergic reactions and even possibly an anaphylactic reaction from absorbing a sardine or an animal RNA - we chop it up in our intestines.\" (Tr. 230-231) Dr. Herbert stated that there is no scientific evidence that dietary RNA will cause wrinkles to disappear; make some individuals look 10-15 years younger; reduce breathlessness and fatigue; heal ace, age spots and other skin ailments; promote a good health and a general sense of well being; or prevent aging and disease. (Tr. 231-232, 303) He also testified that none of the other ingredients in Ribomins would produce the results expressed in the alleged representations. (Tr. 314-15) On cross-examination Dr. Herbert stated that scientific evidence is a report published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal based upon data which is sufficiently valid to allow the possibility of such an interpretation. (Tr. 232) Without specific controls such as double-blind testing it is impossible to separate cause and effect from coincidence. (Tr. 232, 301-2) Therefore, conclusions drawn from treatment without controls, such as the conclusions stated in the testimony of Respondent's witnesses, are not valid. (Tr. 301) Dr. Herbert further testified that conclusions drawn from observing patients and hearing their comments are anecdotal and should be given no weight. In his cross-examination Dr. Herbert traced, in lay terms, the function of RNA in the production and replication of cells as follows: \"***The sequence of events is, that in the nucleus you have DNA. DNA is the basic cellular blueprint. It tells the cell what it is going to be. That is, the DNA blueprint says you are going to be a human being or you are going to be a salmon or you are going to be a cow. That basic blueprint in the nucleus is transferred by the DNA to a negative for the blueprint, just like if you are taking a picture of a blueprint, you a a negative. That negative for the blueprint, which carries the same information, is called messenger RNA. That messenger is made in the nucleus. That is RNA. That messenger RNA then goes to the cytoplasm. It travels out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm where, as you recited my testimony, I indicated the majority of RNA is made. That messenger RNa then goes to tiny bodies in the cytoplasm called ribosomes. On those ribosomes another form of RNA is made from that blueprint of the messenger RNA. And then yet another form of RNA called transfer RNA picks up individual amino acids in the cell and brings them to the ribosome where they hook on in specific relation to the negative of the blueprint and create a protein. That is the life process and it follows a specific blueprint. \"So human RNA only makes humans. Sardine RNA only makes sardines and so on. If sardine RNa, for example, worked in a human, the human would grow fins and a tail, because it is a specific blueprint for making sardines. But RNA is mainly made in the sytoplasm. Messenger RNA is made in the nucleus.\" (Tr. 250-251) Commenting on whether the statement \"RNA is a protein\" is scientifically correct and on the manner of the digestion of RNA, Dr. Herbert said: \"If you use it 'RNA is a protein' to describe ribonucleic protein, yes. If you use it to describe ribonucleic acid, without the protein, no. It depends on how the term is being used. But RNA, ribonucleic acid, is ribos, which is a sugar, and nucleic acid. And nucleic acid is two things. *** It is a molecule made from smaller molecules and the smaller molecules are molecules of purines and paradigms strung to gather with phosphoric acid. *** an RNA molecule is a mixture of a sugar purine and paradigms and phosphate. *** 'RNA is digested just like protein is digested by pancreas ribonuclease, a specific enzyme, which we put in our intestines to destroy sardine RNA, for example, so we don't absorb it and absorb the blueprint that makes us a sardine.\" (Tr. 253) Much of the cross-examination of Dr. Herbert consisted of questions concerning articles or reviews in various scientific publications. Dr. Herbert had either written or contributed to the writing of these articles and reviews. Dr. Herbert's answers to questions put to him on cross-examination did not modify his direct testimony, and they contained little, if anything, to which Respondent could point for support of its position or for weakening of Complainant's case. The following typical series of questions and answers is illustrative of the foregoing statement. \"Q. The Journal of American Medical Associate, (sic) June 27, 1980, Volume 243, number 24 in the Medical News section, there is an article 'Vitamin B15 - whatever it is, it won't help.' Are you familiar with this? A. Yes. Q. You did not author this? A. The author's name is stated at the end of the article. Q. William Check? Q. Yes. Q. It mentions you. I want to read the mention of you and you tell me if this is an accurate characterization of yourself. First, it describes the work reported at the American Society for Clinical Nutrition by Neville Colman and I assume you also? A. Correct, I was a co-author. Q. 'This work is a continuation of the campaign against scientific health fads being waged by Victor Herbert, MD, JD, chief of the Hematology and Nutrition Laboratory,' etcetera. Is that accurate? A. It is an interesting characterization. Q. Is it accurate? A. I don't perceive myself as waging a campaign. I conceive myself as speaking the truth in the field of nutrition. Q. You are familiar with the product in question in this hearing, the vitamin RNA product? A. Yes. Q. Does that fall within your category of unscientific health fads? A. Yes. Q. So this is part of your campaign being waged? A. No, I am not waging a campaign. That is a characterization by someone else not by me. I characterized myself as speaking the truth about nutrition. This is part of my speaking the truth about nutrition.\" (Tr. 269-270) The remainder of the cross-examination of Dr. Herbert, as in the case of that which has just been quoted above, consisted principally of effort, entirely unsuccessful, to discredit this witness (e.g., Tr. 274-277; 293-295; 297-299; 300-301). The testimony of Dr. Herbert relating to the issues in this proceeding concluded with two statements. The first such statement was that there is no recommended dietary allowance for RNA because RNA in the diet serves no dietary purpose. (Tr. 313) Secondly, the witness was asked whether the other ingredients in Ribomins with RNA, namely certain vitamins and minerals, would contribute to the accomplishment of the results stated in the representations alleged in paragraph III of the Complaint as having been made by Respond ent. Dr. Herbert replied that, with one exception, the other ingredients alone or with RNA included can do none of those things. The exception, he stated, is in charge III (e) (that the RNA in Ribomins promotes good health and a general sense of well-being of a person suffering from a specific nutrient deficiency of one of the listed vitamins or minerals would be promoted. However, because the occurrence of deficiency in those vitamins is so rare, such a benefit would be accidental and coincidental. (Tr. 314-315) FINDINGS OF FACTBased upon the evidence hereinbefore summarized and cited below, and based upon other considerations of record noted below, I make the following findings of fact: 1. Respondent has used the advertisement which is Appendix A hereto in the conduct of its business. (Item 1, Respondent's Response to Request for Admission (hereinafter, Response)) 2. Respondent solicits remittances of money through the mail to the name and address shown in the caption hereof for a product called Ribomins, or Ribomins with RNA, consisting of ingredients as heretofore stated. (Items 2, 3 and 4, Response; supra, pp. 3-4; Appendix A) 3. Respondent guarantees that purchasers will be satisfied with the product or they can obtain a full cash refund. (Appendices A and B) 4. Respondent makes the representations set forth in paragraph III of the Complaint. (Appendix A; supra, pp. 5-7) This finding is predicated on the principle that an advertisement is to be considered as a whole and the meaning is to be determined in light of the probable impact of the entire advertise- ment on the person of ordinary mind. Donaldson v. Read Magazine, 333 U.S. 178, 189 (1948); Peak Laboratories, Inc. v. United States Postal Service, 556 F.2d 1387, 1389 (5th Cir. 1977); Unique Ideas, Inc. v. United States Postal Service, 416 F. Supp. 1141, 1145 (S.D.N.Y., 1976). 5. Persons of ordinary mind reading Respondent's advertisement would interpret it substantially as characterized in paragraph III of the Complaint. 6. The representations found to have been made by Respondent are material representations because they are of the kind and character which would persuade readers to order and pay for Respondent's product. 7. The material representations heretofore found to have been made by Respondent in its advertising material are false as a matter of medical fact. a. Respondent's Dr. Susser, is the originator and seller of the product and he is, or has been, the organizer/president of the American Academy of Nutritional Consultants. (Tr. 92-94); supra, p. 21) Dr. Susser bases his statements concerning the effects of taking of Ribomins on the writings of Dr. Jerome S. Frank, a Dr. Allen Nitler, a medical doctor in the State of Washington who is to be reached through California, and a Dr. Howard Lutz, of Washington, D.C. (Tr. 99, 100) b. The testimony in this record is to the effect that Dr. Frank's writings have never been subjected to peer review, and that the results of taking RNA reported therein are anecdotal and without scientific verification. The same lack of verification is true with respect to the results of the self-designated \"testing\" of the product by Drs. Susser, Ledney, Feit, and Atkins. Dr. Frank's writings, the evidence indicates, are without \"scientific validation\" and the results of his use of RNA with patients lacks \"scientific credibility.\" (Dr. Reiff - Tr. 72-76, supra - p. 20; Dr. Susser - Tr. 148; Dr. Atkins - Tr. 215, supra - p. 42; Dr. Herbert - Tr. 300, supra -. 47) c. Dr. Nitler's writings, so far as revealed by this record, appear only in the Journal of the American Academy of Nutritional Consultants. This group is not recognized as being composed of scientific nutritionists. (Dr. Herbert - Tr. 230, supra - p. 45) Furthermore, Dr. Susser, who has an obvious and an admitted interest in the outcome of this proceeding, was evasive in respect to some questions and he claimed not to know whether the journal of that group is listed in MEDLARS or MEDLINE. (Tr. 135; supra - pp. also, Susser at Tr. 141-144; Dr. Herbert's description of the Nutritional Consultant's group makes it clear that he does not think the writings of Dr. Nitler referred to in this proceeding would be published in recognized scientific and professional journals Tr. 230; supra p. 45) d. Dr. Lutz is cited frequently by Dr. Susser, but no citation is given for his work. Although Dr. Lutz is said to be located in Washington, D.C., where three of the four sessions of the hearing were held, Dr. Lutz did not appear as a witness. Thus, testimony concerning his writings and statements is uncorroborated hearsay and of no legal significance. e. Dr. Susser cites Dr. Nitler as his authority for the proposition that RNA is \"absorbed intact or virtually intact.\" (Tr. 99-200, supra - p. 22) Dr. Susser is joined in this statement by Dr. Ledney, except that Dr. Ledney is more positive that dietary RNA is absorbed intact and then it is carried to the particular site in the body where it is needed. Dr. Nitler is referred to as the authority for Dr. Ledney's opinion. (Tr. 171-172; supra - p. 32) f. Dr. Feit, although a warm advocate of the use and value of RNA in the treatment of patients, says that the state of knowledge of his profession concerning RNA is in its infancy. (Tr. 187; supra - p. 32) f. Dr. Feit, although a warm advocate of the use and value of RNA in the treatment of patients, says that the state of knowledge of his profession concerning RNA is in its infancy. (Tr. 187; supra - p. 36) g. Dr. Atkins said that, based on its effectiveness as observed by him in patients for whom he has prescribed it, he has \"reason to believe that at least some supplemental dietary RNA is absorbed intact\" (Tr. 213; supra - p. 42). h. Opposing the above statements that dietary RNA is absorbed intact are the following comments: Dr. Reiff -when RNA as presented in Respondent's product is ingested, it \"is broken down in the intestinal tract to its constituent parts ***\"; Dr. Herbert -\"RNA is made within cells; none of that which comes in diet is absorbed intact \" (Tr. 228, 253; supra - p. 44). Further excerpts from Dr. Herbert's testimony are: \"Any textbook of biochemistry will tell you that dietary RNA is not absorbed intact . This is Principles of Biochemistry, 5th edition by Abraham White, Phylis Handler and Emil Smith. This is published in 1973 by McGraw Hill and I am reciting from chapter 9, entitled nucleic acids and nucleo proteins, tables 9.2, which lists the specificity of nuclease and says 'pancreas deoxyuridine nuclease destroys DNA and pancreas ribonuclease destroys RNA.'\" (Tr. 297) * * * \"It is well established science. Every biochemist including any who might work for your client knows that pancreatic ribonuclease destroys all of the RNA you eat as soon as it hits the small bowel, because if you, for example, absorbed sardine RNA and it got in your cells and worked as RNA, you would turn into a sardine, because it is a specific blueprint.\" (Tr. 298) * * * \"Q Did you rely on that particular text when you testified?\" \"A No, I relied on what I learned in medical school from Irwin Chigaff, among others, in first year biochemistry and my own work in breaking up RNA, which I have done in the course of my research, using pancreatic extract, pancreate and bile case (sic, in transcript), which is a commercial tradename for an Illinois company's brand of mixture of pancreatic proteins, which were used to digest tissue. \"The purpose of the pancrease enzymes is to digest all the things from food that we want to break down before we absorb. Digestion means breaking down and the pancrease enzymes, which go out into the food, as the food leaves the stomach, food comes in the mouth, goes into the stomach, where it is turned into a turgid, muddy, semi-liquid. And then it is poured out of the bottom of the stomach into the top of the intestine. In the top of the intestine there is a tube coming from the pancreas and that tube pours into this liquified mixture of food, the pancreas enzymes, whose job is to chop up things like RNA and DNA and enzymes, so that they don't get absorbed. Because if they are not from a human source, all they can do is harm if they are absorbed intact. They cannot do any good absorbed intact. That is known to every medical student who took first year biochemistry and first year physiology.\" i. Dr. Reiff said categorically that there is nothing in the scientific literature which confirms that Respondent's product, it taken as directed by persons without nutritional deficiencies, would produce the results represented by Respondent in its advertisement. (Tr. 41-44) j. Dr. Herbert testified that there is no scientific evidence that dietary RNA, or Ribomins as constituted, taken as directed, will produce the results represented by Respondent. (Tr. 231-232, 303; supra, pp. 45-46) 8. There is some risk, the magnitude of which is uncertain, involved in the taking of Respondent's product. (Dr. Reiff - Tr. 38-40, supra - p. 15; Dr. Atkins - Tr. 207, 214, supra - p. 42; Dr. Herbert - Tr. 228, 303; supra - p. 44) 9. The fact that the placebo effect may occur in the case of some users does not support the efficacy of the product or the truthfulness of Respondent's representations. Stauffer Laboratories v. F.T.C., 343 F.2d 75 (9th Cir., 1965); Original Cosmetics Products, Inc. v. 459 F. Supp. 496 (S.D.N.Y., 1978); aff'd. 603 F.2d 214, Table, den. 444 U.S. 915 (1979); Wilmont Products, P.S. Docket No. 6/46 (P.S. De., 1979). 10. Expert opinion testimony need not be based upon tests of the particular product in issue to constitute sufficient evidence of false advertising representations. Reilly v. Pinkus, 338 U.S. 269, 274 (1949); Original Cosmetics Products, Inc. v. Strachan, supra; Skinny Suit, P.S. Docket No. 3/44 (P.S. Dec., 2/19/76, p. 6). 11. A finding of falsity can be based on the testimony of expert witnesses whose testimony is in accord with the consensus of informed medical or scientific opinion when there is no contradictory evidence which is said to be in accord with such a consensus of opinion. Athena Products, Ltd., P.S. Docket No. 7/99 (Initial Decision, August 8, 1980, decision now on appeal); Standard Research, P.S. Docket No. 7/78 (Initial Decision, December 18, 1979); Standard Research, P.S. Docket No. 7/48 (Initial Decision, August 31, 1979); Modern Age Products, Inc., P.S. Docket No. 5/102 (P.S. Decision, June 29, 1977; Initial Decision, April 6, 1977); Nutrient Laboratories, P.S. Docket No. 5/48 (Initial Decision, November 17, 1976). 12. The views and opinions expressed by Complainant's witnesses are in accord with the consensus of informed scientific and medical opinion. 13. There was no claim that the views and opinions of Respondent's witnesses were in conformity with the consensus of informed scientific and medical opinion. 14. In the last paragraph of Respondent's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law it is suggested that there is a diversity of opinion among the medical experts which precludes the issuance of a mail-stop order in this matter. Without question there is a division of the opinions of the doctors called as witnesses by the respective parties. When, however, consideration is given to the qualifications of the witnesses, their obvious knowledge, or lack thereof, concerning the action within and by the digestive system on the ingredients of the product involved herein, the interest of the witnesses, and other matters which are weighed in determining authenticity of evidence and credibility of witnesses, the conclusion is inescapable that the clear and decisive preponderance of the evidence is on the side of Complainant. 15. The falsity of Respondent's representations has been established by the preponderance of the competent, credible evidence. 16. Respondent's offer of a refund to dissatisfied purchasers does not overcome the effects of the making of false sales representations. Borg-Johnson Electronics v. Christenberry, U.S.D.C., S.D.N.Y., 169 F. Supp. 746, 751 (1959) CONCLUSIONS OF LAW1. The foregoing Findings of Fact are incorporated herein by reference as Conclusions of Law. 2. Upon the basis of the entire record it is concluded as a matter of law that Respondent is engaged in conducting a scheme or device for obtaining money or property through the mails by means of materially false representations within the meaning of 39 U. S. Code 3005. Proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law submitted by the parties have been fully considered, and to the extent indicated herein, they have been adopted. Otherwise, such proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law are rejected for the reason that they are unsupported by or contrary to the evidence or because of their immateriality. Accordingly, an order of the type authorized by Section 3005 of Title 39, United States Code, substantially in the form attached, should be issued against this Respondent.

October 28, 1983 In the Matter of the Complaint Against THE ROBERTSON-TAYLOR COMPANY Suite 290 781 W. Oakland Park Boulevard at Fort Lauderdale, FL 33311-1729 at 135 E. Oakland Park Blvd. Fort Lauderdale, FL 33334-1153 and at 3033 N.E. 33rd Avenue Fort Lauderdale, FL 33308-7210 P.S. Docket No. 16/98; Grant, Quentin E. APPEARANCE FOR COMPLAINANT: Hilda Rosenberg, Esq. Consumer Protection Division Law Department United States Postal Service Washington, DC 20260-1100 APPEARANCE FOR RESPONDENT: Lee H. Harter, Esq. 2256 Van Ness Avenue San Francisco, CA 94109-2513 INITIAL DECISION General In Complaints filed with this office Complainant alleges that Respondent is in violation of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005 in seeking remittances of money through the mail by means of false representations concerning the products involved in these proceedings. The specific false representations alleged are set forth in the findings of fact below. Respondent's answers to the Complaints deny substantially all the allegations in the three Complaints. On Respondent's motion the hearing location was changed to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where these matters were heard, along with four other similar proceedings against Respondent, on July 19 - 22, 1983. All proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and arguments submitted by the parties have been considered in arriving at these decisions. To the extent indicated they have been adopted. Otherwise, they have been rejected as irrelevant, immaterial, or contrary to the evidence. Complainant's witnesses in these proceedings were Postal Inspector Gary D. Cantley and Dr. William R. Ayers, Associate Dean for Undergraduate Medical Education at Georgetown University Medical School. Respondent's witnesses were Mitchell Kenneth Friedlander, President of Respondent, and, in 16/101 only, Dr. John W. Gaul, an osteopathic physician. FINDINGS OF FACT General 1. Complainant's expert witness, William R. Ayers, is a medical doctor. He is Associate Dean for Undergraduate Medical Education and Associate Professor in the Department of Medicine and Pediatrics in the Georgetown University School of Medicine. He is also Medical Director of the Georgetown Diet Management Program. He is board certified in internal medicine. He has a particular interest in weight control and has several published articles in that field. In addition to setting medical policy in the Diet Management Program, he examines and treats a large number of patients with overweight problems in that program. He keeps current in medicine, including weight control, by regularly reading appropriate respected medical journals. He has testified as an expert in obesity and nutrition in numerous other Postal Service proceedings. His special expertise extends to the vascular system (Tr. 113, 117). Dr. Ayers was exceptionally well qualified to testify on the falsity issues in these proceedings (CX-1; Tr. 113-125). 2. Respondent's expert witness in P.S. Docket No. 16/101, John W. Gaul, is an osteopathic physician who engages in general practice in Davie, Florida, with particular interest in preventive medicine and nutrition. He has a Ph.D. in nutrition (obtained in an off-campus program of about 1 1/2 years) from Donsback University, Huntington Beach, California. He is a member of numerous osteopathic associations, the American Society of Orthomolecular Physicians, the International Academy of Metabology, and the American College of Applied Nutrition. Dr. Gaul did not know whether Donsback University is an accredited institution of higher learning (Tr. 421-434). P.S. Docket No. 16/98 Calor-Bloc 30 3. Respondent, The Robertson-Taylor Company, at the first two addresses set forth in the caption hereof, by means of advertisements and promotional material appearing in generally circulated publications and sent through the mail to prospective customers, seeks remittances of money or property through the mails for its product Calor-Bloc 30 (Tr. 11, Admissions E-1, 2). Attached hereto as Exhibits A, B and C are examples of Respondent's advertisements (Ex. A, \"Weight Loss\" format; Ex. B, \"Block Excess Calories\" format; Ex. C, Short Form format). 4. Customers ordering Calor-Bloc 30 from Respondent receive a powder with the package label shown in CX-13e, wafers with the package label shown in CX-12e, and a brochure (CX-14e) (Respondent's Answer at paragraph 2, Stipulations at Tr. 10, lines 3-5, and Tr. 11, lines 4-6; Admissions at E3, E4, E5). The brochure received by persons ordering Calor-Bloc 30 instructs them to take 2 servings of powder with milk and 10 wafers with milk on the so-called \"on-day\" of the program. This amounts to 700 calories. Participants are not permitted to eat anything else on the \"on-day\", but may eat all they want on the so-called \"off day.\" They are also advised to follow the exercise routine specified 5 days a week, for a total of 20-30 minutes of exercise per day. The exercises include running in place, stretching, pushing, kicking, and sit-ups. 5. Respondent's advertisements represent that ingestion of Calor-Bloc 30 by the ordinary obese person will increase, and maintain at the higher level, the rate at which the body burns calories (Complaint, paragraph III-1). This representation is found in the advertising format with the \"Weight Loss\" caption (Ex. A): Fact: The Calor-Bloc 30 caloric interchange compound feeds the firm \"muscle\" tissue while a higher metabolic set-point burns away fat and flab at an incredible faster rate of speed. ... Calor-Bloc 30 will provide the stimulus to effectively \"boost\" and maintain an excellerated sic metabolic set-point. Your body will evaporate excess calories and stored fat at a faster rate. (e.g. CX-6e) 6. Respondent's advertisements represent that ingestion of Calor-Bloc 30 will cause loss of fat without restriction of food intake and without exercise (Complaint, paragraph III-2). The \"Block Excess Calories\" advertisement (Ex. B) states that \"Calor-Bloc 30 Caloric Interchange Compound\" is \"the key to eliminate unwanted fat,\" and that \"the secret is the formula.\" The reader is then advised that this formula works by blocking calories from being absorbed and becoming excess fat. Enhancing the representation that the formula wards off fat, the advertisement next assures the reader that he/she will not be subjected to the normal rigors of a weight loss program. The advertisement states: Eat your favorite foods, no strenuous exercise. With Calor-Bloc 30 Caloric Interchange Compound you can eat your favorite foods and still maintain a great bulge free body. Calor-Bloc 30 Caloric Interchange Compound is not a simple \"fad\" diet that prescribes tasteless, boring foods and hours of daily exercise. With the Calor-Bloc 30 system you can still enjoy hamburgers, ice-cream, pizza, fried-chicken, etc. and no strenuous exercise is required. 7. The \"weight loss\" advertisements (Ex. A) make the representation alleged in paragraph III-2 of the Complaint in the promises of \"weight loss,\" \"a better, slimmer body,\" and that the compound will \"burn\" or \"evaporate\" fat. They also assure the reader that diet and exercise are not required by stating: Calor-Bloc 30 will do the job without restricting food selection, ridiculous calorie counting or hours of jogging, weight lifting, or costly embarrassing \"Fat Clinics.\" 8. The reader is not informed in the advertisements that food intake must be restricted every other day to the Calor-Bloc wafers and powder plus milk for a total of 700 calories (CX-12e, 13e, 14e, p. 2) nor that 10-15 minutes of exercise, twice-a-day, 5 days a week, is an essential part of Respondent's program (CX-14e, p. 2). The necessity of diet and exercise is not revealed until the purchaser receives the product and accompanying brochure (CX-14e). 9. The word \"system\" attached to Calor-Bloc 30 in some of Respondent's recent ads does not disclose or imply the requirement of diet and exercise to achieve the promised weight losses because where the ads mention diet and exercise it is in a cleverly designed context which implies the opposite: no diet, no exercise. 10. Respondent's advertisements represent that ingestion of Calor-Bloc 30 is effective to produce firm muscle tissue (Complaint, paragraph III-3). This representation serves as one of the themes of the \"weight loss\" advertisements (Ex. A). The advertisement explains that \"you can weigh 135 lbs., look overweight, flabby and out of shape, or, you can look 'great' if the 135 lbs. is made of lean compressed 'muscle type' tissue.\" The advertisement next proposes Calor-Bloc as the solution, stating that the compound \"feeds the firm 'muscle' tissue.\" The notion that it is not merely the number of pounds but the \"type\" of pounds (\"lean, compressed tissue\" vs. \"flab\") which is important to appearance permeates this advertisement, and Calor-Bloc is cited as the means to secure those muscular, lean pounds. For example, \"Calor-Bloc 30 ... is ... for women who are interested in the way they look rather than how many pounds they weigh\" or \"You are guaranteed more than weight loss] We guarantee you a better body]\" 11. Respondent's advertisements represent that ingestion of Calor-Bloc 30 will, without effort or willpower on the user's part, cause development of muscle tissue, loss of weight, and reduction of fat (Complaint, paragraph III-4). This representation is found in the following language in the \"weight loss\" advertisement (Ex. A): \"Developed especially for people on the go. Effortless, automatic, weight loss Guaranteed]\" The representation is reinforced by Respondent's assurance that \"restrictive food selections, ridiculous calorie counting or hours of jogging, weight lifting\" are unnecessary, and that Calor-Bloc will \"give you body the edge 'automatically'.\" 12. Respondent's advertisements represent that the ingestion of Calor-Bloc 30 will prevent the food you eat from turning into unwanted fat and excess weight (Complaint, paragraph III-5). This is the main message to the consumer found in the \"Block Excess Calories\" advertisement (Ex. B). The advertisement's bold heading \"BLOCK EXCESS CALORIES,\" and its subheading, \"The Calor-Bloc 30 system prevents excess calories from being absorbed and turned into unwanted fat,\" lead the reader to believe that this formula will prevent food from becoming fat and excess weight. The name of this product, \"Calor-Bloc-30\", also conveys this impression. The text of this advertisement explains to the reader that he can eat ice-cream and pizza and other fattening foods because Calor-Bloc \"actually prevents fat producing calories from being absorbed into the digestive system.\" The statement of guarantee reminds readers that \"Calor-Bloc-30 Caloric Interchange Compound is a new formulation that simply prevents excess calories from being absorbed and turned into unwanted fat.\" Although the reader is warned that this is not a \"starch blocker,\" the statement does not negate the repeated claim in the advertisement that this formula blocks excess calories from entering the digestive system and blocks the formation of fat. This representation is also found in the short format advertisement used by Respondent (Ex. C). There Respondent states that the compound \"prevents excess calories from being absorbed and turned into unwanted stored fat.\" 13. The ingredients of the Calor-Bloc 30 wafer are listed on the label as follows (CX-12e): INGREDIENTS: Nonfat Dry Milk, Soy Protein, Vanilin, Lecithin, Dry Honey, Magnesium Oxide, Artificial Color, Acetate, Ferrour Fumarate, Lapsang Tea, Aspartame, Syloid. The ingredients of the Calor-Bloc 30 powder are listed on the label as follows (CX-13e): INGREDIENTS: Nonfat dry milk, soy protein, vanilin, lecithin, magnesium artificial color, sodium ascorbate, A-Tocopheryl acetate, fumarate, niacinamide, vitamin lapsang tea, aspartane, syloid. 14. The following findings relating to the issue of falsity of the representations found above are based on the testimony of Complainant's expert witness, Dr. Ayers (Respondent did not present an expert witness in this proceeding): a. There is nothing in the product (either wafer or powder or both), a combination of various vitamins, minerals, proteins, sweeteners, dry milk, and niacinimide, the ingestion of which will result in loss of fat (Tr. 126-128, 202, 203); that will increase and maintain at a higher level the rate at which the human body burns up calories (Tr. 146); that will prevent food from being converted to unwanted fat and excess weight (Tr. 129); that will produce firm muscle tone (Tr. 129, 130); that without effort or willpower on the user's part will cause development of muscle tissue, loss of weight, and reduction of fat (Tr. 136, 137, 202). b. Diet and regular and moderate exercise, and for persons with established obesity, an additional element, psychological counseling, are the methods by which weight loss are achieved (Tr. 134-135). Flabby or soft muscle tissue firms up through exercise (Tr. 129, 134). Such regimens require discipline, changes in dietary habits, including restrictions on food intake, and development of new approaches to food. They demand effort, willpower and a commitment on the part of the patient (Tr. 135, 174). Persons looking for a quick fix, such as persons responding to Respondent's advertisements, are likely to fail to achieve weight loss (Tr. 176, 208). c. The foregoing findings relative to the lack of efficacy of the product are not altered under the metabolic set point theory (Tr. 146). That theory is that an individual's weight is set around a base weight determined by his metabolic set point which is equilibrium (for the individual) between the amount of energy taken in and the amount expended (Tr. 141, 142). Diet, exercise, medication and body temperature affect the set point (Tr. 142). Although diet lowers caloric intake it also decreases the rate of energy utilization. The decrease in the rate of energy use can counteract the effect of reduced caloric intake (Tr. 144). Physical activity, however, counter-balances the fall in the rate of energy utilization (Tr. 145). This theory is generally applied to the obese person (Tr. 146). The Calor-Bloc formula has nothing to do with metabolic set-point theory (Tr. 146). The formula does not increase energy utilization as Respondent's \"Weight Loss\" advertisement states (Tr. 146). Under this theory, it is exercise which increases the rate of energy utilization (Tr. 145). The brochure which accompanies Respondent's product, in contrast to its promotional materials, confirms this point (CX-14e, p. 2 \"The Metabolic Set-Point\"). 15. The opinions expressed by Dr. Ayers on which the preceding findings of fact are based are in accord with the informed medical consensus (Tr. 204). 16. The representations made by Respondent concerning Calor-Bloc 30 as found above are materially false in fact. P.S. Docket No. 16/101 Derma-Tec 90 and Mamralin-BX Breast Augmentation Creams 17. Respondent, at the addresses set forth in the caption hereof, by means of advertisements and promotional materials appearing in generally circulated publications and sent through the mail to prospective customers, seeks remittances of money or property through the mails for its products Derma-Tec 90 and Mamralin-BX Breast Augmentation A3, A4, and CX-A attached to Admissions). 18. Persons ordering Derma-Tec 90 Breast Augmentation Cream receive a jar of cream labeled with one of the following instructions for use and list of ingredients: Usage: Smooth a small amount of Breast Augmentation Cream over the entire breast area. Massage liberally until creme is absorbed. A warm sensation or tingling in the area of application is normal & expected. Do not use on face. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN. Ingredients: Water, lauryl lactate, glyceryl amount of Mamralin-BX over the entire breast area. Massage vigorously until creme is absorbed. A warm sensation or tingling in the area of application is normal & expected. Do not use on face. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN. Ingredients: Filtered Water, Propylene Elastin, Red No. 40. (CX-13a) 19. Persons ordering Mamralin-BX receive a container of cream with instructions for usage and a list of ingredients identical to those in CX-13a for Derma-Tec 90, supra (CX-20a). 20. Attached hereto as Exhibits D, E, and F are typical advertisements of Respondent for Derma-Tec 90 Breast Augmentation Cream (CX-1a, 2a) and Mamralin-BX (CX-8a). 21. As alleged in paragraph II-1 of the Complaint as amended, Respondent's advertisements represent that topical application of Derma-Tec 90 Breast Augmentation Cream or Mamralin-BX will cause a noticeable enlargement of the user's breasts. The advertisements for these products expressly promise this result. Derma-Tec 90 is described in the advertisement and order form as a \"Breast Augmentation Cream.\" The heading of the full page advertisement contains the following language in large print: \"Larger, Firmer Breasts with Derma-Tec 90 Breast Augmentation Cream.\" The entire text of this advertisement is devoted to promising the reader again and again that this product will cause a noticeable enlargement of the breast. Following are examples of the advertising copy which convey this representation: (1) \"Derma-Tec Breast Augmentation Cream will enlarge your breasts moments after application.\" (large, bold print) (2) \"Your breasts will actually become larger in size right before your very eyes ...\" (3) \"The noticeable enlargement of the breast is produced by active stimulators ...\" (4) \"Larger Breasts guaranteed]\" (Ex. D) The shorter form of the Derma-Tec 90 advertisement conveys this same idea-albeit with far fewer words. It says simply: \"Breast Enlargement]]] Derma-Tec 90 Breast Augmentation Cream. The Realistic to Breast Augmentation Surgery.\" (Ex. E) The full-page Mamralin-BX advertisement (Ex. F) makes the representation as follows: The advertisement is headed \"Researchers develop 'assigned dilation' for Scientific Breast Enlargement.\" The advertisement next describes in the following language how this product produces enlargement. Mamralin-BX is a new effective scientific compound that is capable of channeling added amounts of body mass to specific areas of the body that are capable of naturally induced expansion. The breasts (because of the extraordinary properties of breast tissue) are capable of this type of expansion, and the Mamralin-BX Formula can trigger the precise mechanisms which will produce larger, more sensitive, sexual breasts and do it fast, safely and without the permanence or scarring you gamble with if you undergo breast augmentation surgery. The advertisement claims in bold, large type \"the secret is the exclusive Mamralin-BX Formula.\" It indicates that Mamralin-BX \"will create a series of biological actions that will, simply stated, expand the capacity of the breast to accept additional body mass.\" The reader is told: \"You no longer have to feel short-changed.\" A picture of a woman with an unbuttoned shirt partially disclosing ample breasts clears up any possible doubt as to what is being promised. The short form advertisement for Mamralin-BX (CX-19B, p. 2) also promises users noticeable breast enlargement. It is nearly identical to the short form used to promote Derma-Tec 90 Breast Cream, and reads: Breast Enlargement]]] Mamralin-BX Breast Augmentation Cream Mamralin-BX Breast Augmentation Cream. The realistic alternative to Breast Augmentation Surgery. 22. As alleged in paragraph II-2 of the Complaint, Respondent's advertisements for Derma-Tec 90 Breast Augmentation Cream represent that the cream will cause a measurable, if temporary, increase in the amount of breast tissue. Respondent's advertisement states that this \"incredible augmentation cream is applied as a massage and penetrates the outer layers of your breast tissue\" and \"will activate and ENLARGE the bust\" and goes on to state that the \"noticeable enlargement of the breast is produced by the active stimulators, Vaso Dilators, Dermal Hydration Compounds that are present in complex base formulation of tissue builders and skin strengtheners.\" emphasis supplied (Ex. D). The only mechanism for breast enlargement mentioned in lay language in the advertisement is tissue building. There are contributory mechanisms suggested in technical terms (such as \"vaso dilators\") which are not likely to be understood by the average reader. I conclude that the advertisement does, in the quoted language, make the representation alleged. 23. According to Dr. Ayers, topical application of Derma-Tec 90 or of Mamralin-BX to the female breast will not cause noticeable enlargement of the breast and the topical application of Derma-Tec 90 will not cause an increase in the amount of breast tissue (Tr. 231). Respondent's doctor agreed that these products would not noticeably enlarge the breast although the vasodilation produced by niacin in one of the Derma-Tec 90 formulations would probably cause the user to feel increased fullness of the breast (Tr. 448, 453). 24. Niacinamide contained in Mamralin-BX and another of the Derma-Tec 90 formulations is not a vaso dilator CX-2, p. 568; CX-3, p. 811; CX-4, p. 15) and, therefore, would not even contribute to a feeling of increased fullness. 25. Vasodilation is the only mechanism advanced by Respondent to support its claim of breast enlargement in prehearing exchange of information (CX-21a) and in evidence introduced at the hearing. 26. The opinions expressed by Dr. Ayers in this proceeding are in accord with the informed medical and scientific consensus (Tr. 251). 27. The representations made by Respondent concerning Derma-Tec 90 Breast Augmentation Cream and Mamralin-BX as found above are materially false in fact. P.S. Docket No. 16/120 Synertrim #9 28. Respondent, at the first two addresses set forth in the caption hereof, by means of advertisements and promotional materials appearing in generally circulated publications and sent through the mail to prospective customers, seeks remittances of money or property through the mails for its product Synertrim #9 (Stip. at Tr. 27-29). 29. Persons ordering Synertrim #9 receive a container of cream with a label containing the following instructions for use and list of ingredients (CX-8g): Usage: Massage a small amount of creme over the skin area you wish to tighten and tone. Allow creme to remain 1 to 2 hours, then wash off. The creme may cause a warm sensation or cause the skin to be pink for a short time. You must start the Synertrim #9 program immediately after application of Synertrim #9 Emulsion. NOT FOR USE ON FACE OR BREAST. Ingredients: Filtered Water, Propylene Collagen, Hydrolyzed Elastin, Propylparaben. They also receive a brochure containing an exercise program (CX-9g). Respondent's advertisements do not mention the exercise program. The brochure advises one who has already purchased the cream that she must start the exercise program within 5 minutes after application of the product and perform the exercises at least 5 days a week. 30. Attached hereto as Exhibits G, H, and I are typical advertisements of Respondent for Synertrim #9 (CX-1g, 2g, 4g). 31. As alleged in the Complaint (paragraphs III-1 and III-3), Respondent's advertisements for the product represent that topical application thereof will cause a loss of body weight and a reduction of body fat in specific areas of the body. Respondent's \"Shape-Up\" advertisement (Ex. I) begins by specifying conditions which Synertrim #9 is later proposed to alleviate. \"Large thighs\" is one of those conditions. The advertisement states that this \"incredible formula\" will \"specifically trim down your thighs.\" The Respondent next notes that its product was developed by \"Weight loss specialists\" (as well as \"dermal fortification specialists\") for \"spot reduction.\" These statements taken together represent that the use of this product will promote weight loss. Synertrim #9 formula is repeatedly referred to as a \"spot reduction formula,\" making obvious that this is its intended purpose. That Synertrim specifically reduces body fat is confirmed by the advertisement's explanation of how the product works. The advertisement states that the formula will \"restructure the balance of tissue densities in specific problem areas (adding more compact firm tissue, reducing excess subcutaneous fat).\" The short form advertisement (Ex. G) also holds out Synertrim #9 as causing weight loss and fat reduction by referring to it as a \"spot reduction formula,\" indicating that it will \"slim ... the total rear view,\" and hailing it as the solution to \"saggy, bulging thighs, hips and buttocks,\" as well as cellulite, which is merely subcutaneous fat (Tr. 220-221). 32. As alleged in the Complaint (par. III-2) Respondent's advertisements represent that use of the product will cause a reduction in size of specific body areas such as thighs, hips, and buttocks. That Synertrim #9 is directed toward the hips, thighs and buttocks is apparent from the illustration of the thighs, hips and buttocks of a woman clad in a bikini (Ex. I). The \"Shape Up\" advertisement specifically promises that the formulation will \"trim down your thighs.\" By labeling the product a \"spot reducing formula,\" and referring to it this way several times throughout the advertisement, Respondent represents that the formula will reduce the size of specific body areas. The short form advertisement also makes this representation by claiming that the formula will \"slim ... the total rear view,\" by presenting it as a solution for \"saggy, bulging thighs, hips and buttocks\" and by identifying it as a \"spot reduction formula.\" 33. As alleged in the Complaint as amended (par. III-6) Respondent's advertisements represent that Synertrim #9 will firm up soft and sagging areas of the body such as thighs and buttocks. This representation is supported by language in the \"Shape Up\" advertisement (in the heading and testimonials) to the effect that this product will \"shape up\" your body. More specifically the formula is represented as dealing with the problem of a behind which is \"starting to sag\" and \"hips and rear\" which are hailed as that \"incredible formula\" which will \"lift and firm a sagging rear.\" The advertisement explains that this formula will \"restructure the balance of tissue densities in specific problem areas (adding more compact firm tissue, reducing excess subcutaneous fat).\" The short form advertisement makes this representation by stating that Synertrim #9 will \"shape up your rear end,\" \"tighten, slim and reshape the total rear view\" and that it is to be used on \"sagging, bulging thighs, hips and buttocks.\" 34. Respondent's advertisements also represent that the results promised in the representations found above will occur without exercise (Complaint par. III-4). Respondent's advertisements expressly refer to the \"formula\" or \"emulsion\" as effecting the promised results. They omit any mention of the exercise routine which accompanies the formula when received by purchasers. When this omission is combined with affirmative representations of slimming and firming resulting specifically from use of the emulsion or formula, there is an implied representation that the cream and not any undisclosed exercise regimen brings about the results. 35. Respondent's advertisements represent that Synertrim's ability to cause weight loss, a reduction in size of specific body areas such as thighs and buttocks, and a reduction of body fat on specific body areas-all without exercise-has been established by competent scientific tests and studies (Complaint, paragraph III-5). The \"Shape Up\" advertisement refers to Synertrim in bold, large print as \"a proven scientific treatment.\" The advertisement's statement of guarantee calls Synertrim a \"scientifically documented program.\" The Respondent explains the development of the product as follows: \"Synertrim #9 was formulated by weight loss and dermal fortification specialists at the Robertson-Taylor Company, a division of Intra-Medic Formulations, Inc.\" These statements imply that the product has been studied and tested in a competent scientific manner, and the results demonstrate that Synertrim #9 is effective to produce the benefits advertised, i.e., weight loss, fat reduction, and decrease in body size. 36. The following findings relative to the falsity issues in this proceeding are based on the testimony of Complainant's expert witness, Dr. Ayers. Respondent's doctor did not testify concerning Synertrim #9. The topical use of Synertrim #9 without exercise will not cause loss of body weight, reduction of body fat on specific body areas, or reduction of the size of specific body areas such as thighs, hips, and buttocks (Tr. 214, 224, 225). Topical use of the product will not firm up soft and sagging body areas such as hips and buttocks (Tr. 215-217, 226, 227). The conditions which Respondent's advertisements promise the product will treat are caused by increased subcutaneous fat, stretching of the supporting tissue that binds the skin to deeper structures, and poor muscle tone (Tr. 215, 216). These conditions may be alleviated through weight loss, which will remove the excess subcutaneous fat, and exercise, which will improve muscle tone and firm up soft areas (Tr. 218, 226-227). Topical use of Synertrim #9 will not produce weight loss, improvement of muscle tone, or firm up soft tissues (Tr. 217). These views are in accord with the informed medical consensus (Tr. 218). 37. Respondent failed to produce in accordance with Complainant's request for production any test or studies supporting the representations of efficacy of the product found above. Dr. Ayers' research did not disclose any reports or studies supporting such representations. Therefore, I find to be false Respondent's representation that the efficacy of the product is supported by competent scientific tests or studies. 38. All of the representations alleged in the Complaint as found above are materially false in fact. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW 1. The meaning of advertising representations is to be judged from a consideration of an advertisement in its totality and the impression it would most probably create in ordinary minds. Donaldson v. Read Magazine, 333 U.S. 178 (1948); Vibra-Brush Corp. v. Schaffer, 169 F. Supp. 746 (S.D.N.Y. 1959). Express representations are not required. It is the net impression which the advertisement is likely to make upon purchasers to whom it is directed which is important, and even if an advertisement is so worded as not to make an express representation, if it is artfully designed to mislead those responding to it the mail fraud statutes are applicable. G. J. Howard v. Cassidy, 162 F. Supp. 568. See, also, Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Council, 425 U.S. 748 (1976). The foregoing principles of interpretation were employed in arriving at the findings of representations made by Respondent concerning the products involved in these proceedings. 2. The fact that many people may believe that exercise or diet are necessary to lose weight does not prevent the average reader from interpreting Respondent's advertisements for Synertrim #9 and Calor-Bloc 30 as representing that such measures are unnecessary. The New Body Boutique, P.S. Docket No. 11/95, Postal Service Decision on Petition for Supplemental Order and Request for Hearing at pages 8-9 (November 30, 1982), aff'd mem., New Body Boutique, Inc. v. United States Postal Service, Civil Action No. 83-0197 (D.D.C. April 21, 1983); New Body Boutique, Inc., P.S. Docket No. 10/169, Postal Service Decision at p. 10 (July 7, 1982); Specialty Sales Co., P.S. Docket No. 11/79, Postal Service Decision at p. 7 (April 15, 1982). 3. Although informed persons may readily recognize that Respondent's advertising claims are false and absurd, this does not detract from their tendency to \"deceive the ignorant, gullible and less experienced.\" Gottlieb v. Schaffer, 141 F. Supp. 7, 16 (S.D.N.Y. 1956). The false representation statute was intended to protect such persons as well. Donaldson v. Read Magazine, Inc., supra. 4. A descriptive product name is itself a representation of the qualities of the product. Slumber-Shapers, Inc., P.S. Docket No. 2/20, Postal Service Decision (1973). Derma-Tec 90 Breast Augmentation Cream, Synertrim #9 Spot Reduction Formula, and Calor-Bloc 30 Caloric Interchange Compound are such descriptive product names. 5. The exercise program received with a Synertrim #9 order, and the diet and exercise programs received with a Calor-Bloc order, come too late to dispel the impression created by the advertisements that such measures are unnecessary. See Kurzon v. United States Postal Service, 539 F.2d 788, 795 (1st Cir. 1976); The New Body Boutique, Inc., P.S. Docket No. 11/95, Postal Service Decision at p. 7 (July 30, 1982). 6. Evidence, other than Respondent's advertisements and other promotional materials, on the issue of the making of the representations charged in the Complaint is unnecessary. Manuel Garcia Imports, P.S. Docket No. 5/127, Postal Service Decision at p. 5 (1977); Beauty Originals, Inc., P.S. Docket No. 3/24, Postal Service Decision at p. 3 (1975) (\" T he cases are legion in which the trier of fact is recalled upon to apply the test of Donaldson v. Read, 333 U.S. 178, without resort to lay testimony.\") 7. The average person reading Respondent's advertisements would interpret them substantially as characterized in the complaints as amended. 8. An expert witness may rely on the product label in forming his opinion on the veracity of the advertising claims made for the product. No chemical analysis is required. Vitahair, P.S. Docket No. 7/76, Initial Decision (1978); Derma-Diet, P.S. Docket No. 5/171, Postal Service Decision (1977). The product label may be assumed to be correct, unless Respondent comes forward with evidence that there are additional ingredients in the product. Schiffahrts Laboratories, P.S. Docket No. 3/193, Initial Decision (1976). Respondent did not produce such evidence. 9. Expert opinion testimony need not be based upon tests of the particular product to constitute sufficient evidence of false advertising. Reilly v. Pinkus, 338 U.S. 269, 274 (1949); Original Cosmetics Products, Inc. v. Strachan, 459 Supp. 496 (S.D.N.Y. 1978), aff'd, 603 F.2d (2d Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 195 (1979); Athena Products Ltd., P.S. Docket No. 12/136, Decision on Motions and Initial Decision at p. 30 (August 13, 1982) aff'd, Postal Service Decision (May 16, 1983). 10. The existence of a money back guarantee does not preclude a finding that the postal misrepresentation statute has been violated because a promise of guarantee will not dispel Respondent's false representations. Borg-Johnson Electronics, Inc. v. Christenberry, 169 F. Supp. 746, 751 (S.D.N.Y. 1959); G. J. v. Cassidy, F. 568, 572 (E.D.N.Y. 1958); Farley v. Heininger, 105 F.2d 79, 84 (D.C. Cir. 1939); George M. Ernst, Jr. d/b/a Many Interested Savers, Inc., P.S. Docket No. 13/88, Postal Service Decision (August 4, 1982). 11. The representations made by Respondent concerning the products involved in these proceedings, as found above, are materially false in fact. 12. Complainant has established its case in these proceedings by a preponderance of the reliable and probative evidence of record. 13. Respondent is engaged in the conduct of schemes for obtaining money or property through the mails by means of materially false representations concerning the products involved in these proceedings in violation of 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3005. 14. Orders in the form attached should be issued against Respondent. This page was posted on July 16, 2004.

Stephen Barrett, M.D. Each of the following approaches has at least one of the following characteristics: (1) its rationale or underlying theory has no scientific basis, (2) it has not been demonstrated safe and/or effective by well-designed studies, (3) it is deceptively promoted, or (4) its practitioners are not qualified to make appropriate diagnoses. This article covers traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, ayurvedic medicine, clinical ecology, colonic irrigation, craniosacral therapy, herbalism, iridology, macrobiotics, naturopathy, [aromatherapy](aroma.html), [chelation called \"Oriental medicine\" or \"traditional Chinese medicine (TCM),\" encompasses a vast array of folk medical practices based on mysticism. It holds that the body's vital energy (chi or qi) circulates through 14 hypothetical channels, called meridians, that have branches connected to bodily organs and functions. Illness is attributed to imbalance or interruption of chi. Ancient practices such as [acupuncture](acu.html) and Qigong are claimed to restore balance by removing the interruptions. Traditional acupuncture, as now practiced, involves the insertion of stainless steel needles into various body areas. A low-frequency current may be applied to the needles to produce greater stimulation. Acupressure (shiatsu) is a technique that uses finger pressure instead of needles. Some states restrict the use of acupuncture to physicians or persons operating under the direct supervision of physicians, while others permit laypersons to practice without medical supervision. The treatment is applied to \"acupuncture points,\" which are said to be located throughout the body. Originally there were 365 such points, corresponding to the days of the year, but the number identified by proponents during the past 2,000 years has increased gradually to over 2,000 [1]. Some practitioners place needles at or near the site of disease, while others select points on the basis of symptoms. In traditional acupuncture a combination of points is usually used. However, the existence of \"meridians,\" \"acupuncture points,\" or chi has never been scientifically validated. Some acupuncturists reject Chinese medicine's trappings and postulate that pain relief occurs through mechanisms such as the production of endorphins (chemicals similar to narcotics). Although acupuncture may relieve pain, such relief tends to be short-lived. The evidence supporting claims that acupuncture is effective consists mostly of practitioners' observations and poorly designed studies. Acupuncture has not been proven to influence the course of any organic disease. The adverse effects of acupuncture are probably related to the nature of the practitioner's training. A survey of 1,135 Norwegian physicians revealed 66 cases of infection, 25 cases of punctured lung, 31 cases of increased pain, and 80 other cases with complications. A parallel survey of 197 acupuncturists, who are more apt to see immediate complications, yielded 132 cases of fainting, 26 cases of increased pain, 8 cases of pneumothorax, and 45 other adverse results [2]. However, a 5-year study involving 76 acupuncturists at a Japanese medical facility tabulated only 64 adverse event reports (including 16 forgotten needles and 13 cases of transient low blood pressure) associated with 55,591 acupuncture treatments. No serious complications were reported.The researchers concluded that serious adverse reactions are uncommon among acupuncturists who are medically trained [3]. Qigong is also claimed to influence the flow of vital energy. Internal Qigong involves deep breathing, concentration, and relaxation techniques used by individuals for themselves. External Qigong is performed by \"Qigong masters\" who claim to cure a wide variety of diseases with energy released from their fingertips. However, scientific investigators of Qigong masters in China have found no evidence of paranormal powers and some evidence of deception. Investigators have observed, for example, that a patient lying on a table about eight feet from a Qigong master moved rhythmically or thrashed about as the master moved his hands. But when she was placed where she could no longer see him, her movements were unrelated to his. The diagnostic process used by TCM practitioners may include questioning (medical history, life-style), observations (skin, tongue, color), listening (breath sounds), and pulse-taking. Medical science recognizes only one pulse, corresponding to the heartbeat, which can be felt in the wrist, neck, feet, and various other places throughout the body. TCM practitioners check six alleged pulses at each wrist and identify more than twenty-five alleged pulse qualities such as \"sinking,\" \"slippery,\" \"soggy,\" \"tight,\" and \"wiry.\" TCM's \"pulses\" supposedly reflect the type of imbalance, the condition of each organ system, and the status of the patient's \"chi.\" The herbs prescribed by Chinese medicine practitioners in the United States are not regulated for safety, potency, or effectiveness. There is also the risk that an acupuncturist whose approach to diagnosis is not based on scientific concepts will fail to diagnose a dangerous condition. The National Council Against Health Fraud has concluded: (a) acupuncture is an unproven modality of treatment, (b) its theory and practice are based on primitive and fanciful concepts of health and disease that bear no relationship to present scientific knowledge, (c) research during the past 20 years has not demonstrated that acupuncture is effective against any disease, (d) perceived effects of acupuncture are probably due to a combination of expectation, suggestion, counter-irritation, conditioning, and other psychologic mechanisms, (e) the use of acupuncture should be restricted to appropriate research settings, (f) insurance companies should not be required by law to cover acupuncture treatment, (g) licensure of lay acupuncturists should be phased out, and (8) consumers who wish to try acupuncture should discuss their situation with a knowledgeable physician who has no commercial interest [4]. [Ayurvedic medicine](../../04ConsumerEducation/chopra.html) is set of practices promoted by proponents of transcendental meditation (TM). Ayurveda (meaning \"life knowledge\") is a traditional Indian approach that includes meditation, \"purification\" procedures, rejuvenation therapies, herbal and mineral preparations, exercises and dietary advice based on \"body type.\" Its origin is traceable to four Sanskrit books called the Vedas \u2014 the oldest and most important scriptures of India, shaped sometime before 200 BCE. These books attributed most disease and bad luck to demons, devils, and the influence of stars and planets. Ayurveda's basic theory states that the body's functions are regulated by three \"irreducible physiological principles\" whose Like the \"sun signs\" of astrology, these terms are used to designate body types as well as the traits that typify them. Like astrologic writings, ayurvedic writings contain long lists of supposed physical and mental characteristics of each constitutional type. Through various combinations of vata, pitta, and kapha, ten body types are possible. However, one's doshas (and therefore one's body type) can vary from hour to hour and season to season. Ayurvedic proponents claim that the symptoms of disease are always related to \"imbalance\" of the doshas, which can be determined by feeling the patient's wrist pulse or completing a questionnaire. Some proponents claim that the pulse can be used to detect diabetes, cancer, musculoskeletal disease, asthma, and \"imbalances at early stages when there may be no other clinical signs and when mild forms of intervention may suffice.\" \"Balance\" is supposedly achieved through a multitude of procedures and products, many of which are said to be specific for specific body types. The full Maharishi Ayur-Ved program for \"creating healthy individuals and a disease-free society\" has 20 components: development of higher states of consciousness through advanced meditation techniques, use of primordial sounds, correction of \"the mistake of the intellect,\" strengthening of emotions, Vedic structuring of language, music therapy, enlivening of the senses, pulse diagnosis, psychophysiological integration, neuromuscular integration, neurorespiratory integration, purification (to remove \"impurities due to faulty diet and behavioral patterns\"), dietary measures, herbal food supplements, other herbal preparations, daily behavioral routines, prediction of future imbalances, religious ceremonies, nourishing the environment, and promoting world health and world peace. Most of these cost several hundred dollars, but some cost thousands and require the services of an ayurvedic practitioner TM is a technique in which the meditator sits comfortably with eyes closed and mentally repeats a Sanskrit word or sound (mantra) for 15 to 20 minutes, twice a day. It is alleged to help people think more clearly, improve their memory, recover immediately from stressful situations, reverse their aging process, and enjoy life more fully. Proponents also claim that \"stress is the basis of all illness\" and that TM is \"the single most effective thing you can do to improve all aspects of health and to increase inner happiness and learning ability.\" Deepak Chopra, M.D., a leading ayurveda proponent, claims that \"If you have happy thoughts, then you make happy molecules. On the other hand, if you have sad thoughts, and angry thoughts, and hostile thoughts, then you make those molecules which may depress the immune system and make you more susceptible to disease.\" Chopra promises \"perfect health\" to those who can harness their consciousness as a healing force. Meditation may temporarily relieve stress \u2014 as would many types of relaxation techniques \u2014 but the rest of these claims have no scientific basis. [Clinical ecology](mcs.html), which proponents also misrepresent as \"environmental medicine,\" is not a recognized medical specialty. It is based on the notion that multiple common symptoms are triggered by hypersensitivity to common foods and chemicals. Proponents typically suggest that the immune system is like a barrel that continually fills with chemicals until it overflows, signaling the presence of disease. However, some also say that \"immune system dysregulation\" can be triggered by a single serious episode of infection, stress, or chemical exposure. Potential stressors include practically everything that modern humans encounter, such as urban air, diesel exhaust, tobacco smoke, fresh paint or tar, organic solvents and pesticides, certain plastics, newsprint, perfumes and colognes, medications, gas used for cooking and heating, building materials, permanent press and synthetic fabrics, household cleaners, rubbing alcohol, felt-tip pens, cedar closets, tap water, and electromagnetic forces. Clinical ecologists typically base their diagnoses on \"provocation-neutralization\" testing. In this test, the patient reports symptoms that develop within ten minutes after various concentrations of suspected substances are administered under the tongue or injected into the skin. If any symptoms occur, the test is considered positive and lower concentrations are given until a dose is found that \"neutralizes\" the symptoms. Treatment requires avoidance of suspected substances and involves lifestyle changes that can range from minor to extensive. Generally, patients are instructed to modify their diet and to avoid such substances as scented shampoos; after-shave products; deodorants; cigarette smoke; automobile exhaust fumes; and clothing, furniture, and carpets that contain synthetic fibers. Extreme restrictions can involve staying at home for months or avoiding physical contact with family members. In many cases the patient's life becomes centered around the illness. Researchers at the University of California have demonstrated that provocation- neutralization testing is not valid. In a double-blind study, each of 18 patients received three injections of suspected food extracts and nine of dilute salt water over a three-hour period. The tests were carried out in the offices of proponents who had been treating the patients. In nonblinded tests, these patients had consistently reported symptoms when exposed to food extracts and no symptoms when given salt-water injections. But during the experiment, the patients reported as many symptoms following one type of injection as they did after the other, indicating that their symptoms were nothing more than placebo reactions. The symptoms included itching of the nose, watery or burning eyes, plugged ears, a feeling of fullness in the ears, ringing ears, dry mouth, scratchy throat, an odd taste in the mouth, fatigue, headache, nausea, dizziness, abdominal discomfort, tingling of the face or scalp, tightness or pressure in the head, disorientation, difficulty breathing, depression, chills, coughing, nervousness, intestinal gas or rumbling, and aching legs. Clinical ecologists also claim that \"neutralizing\" doses of offending allergens can relieve the patient's symptoms. However, the patients who were treated during the experiment had equivalent responses to extracts and salt water [5]. The American Academy of Allergy and Immunology (AAAI), the nation's largest professional organization of allergists, has warned: Although the idea that the environment is responsible for a multitude of health problems is very appealing, to present such ideas as facts, conclusions, or even likely mechanisms without adequate support, is poor medical practice [6]. [Colonic irrigation](gastro.html) \u2014 also called colon hydrotherapy \u2014 is typically performed by passing a rubber tube into the rectum for a distance of up to 20 or 30 inches. Warm water is pumped in and out through the tube, a few pints at a time, typically using 20 or more gallons. Some practitioners add herbs, coffee, or other substances to the water. The procedure is said to \"detoxify\" the body. Its advocates claim that, as a result of intestinal stasis, intestinal contents putrefy, and toxins are formed and absorbed, which causes chronic poisoning of the body. This \"autointoxication\" theory was popular around the turn of the century but was abandoned by the scientific community during the 1920s. No such \"toxins\" have ever been identified, and careful observations have shown that individuals in good health can vary greatly in bowel habits. Proponents may also suggest that fecal material collects on the lining of the intestine and causes trouble unless removed by laxatives, colonic irrigation, special diets, and/or various herbs or food supplements that \"cleanse\" the body. The falsity of this notion is obvious to doctors who perform intestinal surgery or peer within the large intestine with a diagnostic instrument. Fecal material does not adhere to the intestinal lining. Colonic irrigation is not only therapeutically worthless but can cause fatal electrolyte imbalance [7]. Cases of death due to intestinal perforation and infection (from contaminated equipment) have also been reported [8-10]. Craniosacral therapy, also called craniopathy and cranial osteopathy, is based on the notion that bones of the skull are moveable and can be manipulated. Some practitioners claim to attune themselves to the patient's \"rhythm\" while holding the patient's skull in their hands. Some claim to improve the flow of \"life energy,\" thereby curing or preventing a wide variety of health problems. Some claim to remove blockages to the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. Some claim to realign the skull bones. Actually, the bones of the skull fuse early in life and cannot be moved independently. Herbalism is practiced mainly by naturopaths, chiropractors, acupuncturists, iridologists, and unlicensed \"herbalists,\" many of whom prescribe herbs for virtually every health problem. While some attempt to base their prescriptions on research findings, others are guided by such perceptions as \"astrological influences\" and the \"Doctrine of Signatures\" (the ancient belief that the form and shape of a drug source determine its therapeutic value). Many herbs contain hundreds or even thousands of chemicals that have not been completely catalogued. While some of these may turn out to be useful as therapeutic agents, others could well prove toxic. Most herbal products sold in the United States are not standardized, which means that determining the exact amounts of their ingredients can be difficult or impossible. With safe and effective medicines available, treatment with herbal products makes little sense. Moreover, many herbal practitioners are not physicians and lack adequate training in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. [Iridology](iridology.html) is based on the notion that each area of the body is represented by a corresponding area in the iris of the eye (the colored area surrounding the pupil). Iridologists claim that states of health and disease can be diagnosed according to the color, texture, and location of various pigment flecks in the eye. Iridology practitioners purport to diagnose \"imbalances\" and treat them with vitamins, minerals, herbs, and similar products. They may also claim that the eye markings can reveal a complete history of past illnesses as well as previous treatment. Most iridology practitioners are chiropractors and naturopaths, but laypersons who do \"nutrition counseling\" also are involved. Bernard Jensen, D.C., the leading American iridologist, states that \"Nature has provided us with a miniature television screen showing the most remote portions of the body by way of nerve reflex responses.\" He also claims that iridology analyses are more reliable and \"offer much more information about the state of the body than do the examinations of Western medicine.\" However, in two large studies, Jensen and seven other prominent iridologists could not distinguish between patients who had kidney or gallbladder disease and those who were healthy. Nor did they agree with each other about which was which [11,12]. This is not surprising, because there is no known way that body organs could be represented at specific locations in the iris. Macrobiotics is a quasireligious approach centered around a semivegetarian diet claimed to improve health and prolong life. Proponents suggest that the diet is effective in preventing and treating cancer, AIDS, and other serious diseases. There is no scientific evidence to support these claims. Macrobiotic proponents base their recommendations for foods on the amount of \"yin\" or \"yang\" (alleged \"energy modes\") rather than nutrient content. Macrobiotic practitioners may base their recommendations on pulse diagnosis and other unscientific procedures related to Chinese medicine. These include influences\" and and \"spiritual diagnosis\" (an evaluation of \"atmospheric vibrational conditions\" to identify spiritual influences, including memories and \"visions of the future\"). The leading proponent has been Michio Kushi, founder and president of the Kushi Institute in Brookline, Massachusetts. According to Institute publications, the macrobiotic way of life should include chewing food at least 50 times per mouthful (or until it becomes liquid), not wearing synthetic or woolen clothing next to the skin, avoiding long hot baths or showers, having large green plants in your house to enrich the oxygen content of the air, and singing a happy song every day. Kushi claims that cancer is largely due to improper diet, thinking, and way of life, and can be influenced by changing these factors. He recommends \"yin foods\" for cancers due to excess yang, and \"yang foods\" for tumors that are predominantly yin. His books contain case histories of people whose cancers have supposedly disappeared after they adopted macrobiotic eating. However, the only reports of efficacy are testimonials by patients, many of whom received conventional cancer therapy. The diet itself can cause cancer patients to undergo serious weight loss [13]. Some versions of macrobiotic diets contain adequate amounts of nutrients, but others do not. Studies of children living in several macrobiotic communities have found that they tended to be smaller, shorter, and to weigh less than children fed normal diets. Deficiencies of vitamin B12, iron, and vitamin D have also been reported. [Naturopathy](Naturopathy/naturopathy.html) is based on the belief that the cause of disease is violation of nature's laws. Naturopaths claim to remove the underlying causes of disease and to stimulate the body's natural healing processes. They state that diseases are the body's effort to defend itself and that cures result from increasing the patient's \"vital force\" by ridding the body of waste products and \"toxins.\" Like some chiropractors, many naturopaths believe that virtually all ailments fall within the scope of their practice. Naturopathic treatments can include \"natural food\" diets, vitamins, herbs, tissue minerals, cell salts, manipulation, massage, exercise, diathermy, colonic enemas, acupuncture, and homeopathy. Although naturopaths claim that they stress prevention of disease, they tend to oppose immunization procedures. Natural hygiene is an offshoot of naturopathy that emphasizes fasting; a raw-food diet of vegetables, fruits, and nuts; and food-combining, a dietary practice based on the incorrect notion that certain food combinations can cause or correct ill health. Natural hygienists oppose immunization, fluoridation, and food irradiation and eschew most forms of medical treatment. [Orthomolecular therapy](ortho.html) is defined by its proponents as \"the treatment of disease by varying the concentrations of substances normally present in the human body.\" It dates back to the early 1950s when a few psychiatrists began adding massive doses of nutrients to their treatment of severe mental problems. The original substance was vitamin B3 (nicotinic acid or nicotinamide), and the therapy was termed \"megavitamin therapy.\" Later the treatment regimen was expanded to include other vitamins, minerals, hormones, and diets, any of which may be combined with conventional drug therapy and electroshock treatments. A few hundred physicians now use this approach to treat a wide variety of conditions, both mental and physical. The human body has limited capacity to use vitamins in its metabolic activities. When vitamins are consumed in excess of the body's physiological needs, they function as drugs rather than vitamins. A few situations exist in which high doses of vitamins are known to be beneficial, but they must still be used with caution because of potential toxicity. For example, large doses of niacin can be very useful as part of a comprehensive, medically supervised program for controlling abnormal blood cholesterol levels. \"Orthomolecular\" practitioners go far beyond this, however, by prescribing large amounts of supplements to all or most of the patients they treat. [Reflexology,](reflex.html) also called zone therapy, is based on beliefs that each body part is represented on the hands and feet and that pressing on specific areas on the hands or feet can have therapeutic effects in other parts of the body. Proponents claim that the body is divided into ten zones that begin or end in the hands and feet, and that each organ or body part is \"represented\" on the hands and feet. Proponents also claim that abnormalities can be diagnosed by feeling the feet and that pressing each area can stimulate the flow of energy, blood, nutrients, and nerve impulses to the corresponding body zone. The pathways postulated by reflexologists have not been anatomically demonstrated. Most reflexologists claim that their foot massages can relieve stress, which presumably is correct but does not require the services of a \"certified reflexologist\" for $35 to $100 per session. Many practitioners claim foot reflexology can cleanse the body of toxins, increase circulation, assist in weight loss, and improve the health of organs throughout the body. Some claim that reflexology is effective against a large number of serious diseases. There is no scientific support for these assertions. [Therapeutic touch](tt.html) is a method in which the hands are used to \"direct human energies to help or heal someone who is ill.\" Proponents claim that healers can detect and correct \"energy imbalances\" by stroking the body or placing their hands above the afflicted part. Healing supposedly can result from a transfer of \"excess energy\" from healer to patient. Neither the forces involved nor the alleged therapeutic benefits have been demonstrated by scientific testing [14]. It is safe to assume that any reactions to the procedure are psychological responses to the \"laying on of hands.\" A recent study of 21 TT practitioners found no evidence that they could actually detect a human energy field.\" [14] References - Skrabanek P.

[Hide Full Content](#thirteen-thousand-one-hundred-thirty-one) [Why Cranial Therapy Is Silly](https://quackwatch.org/related/cranial/) Craniosacral therapy (CST) is one of many terms used to describe a various methods based on fanciful claims that: The human brain makes rhythmic movements at a rate of 10 to 14 cycles per minute, a periodicity unrelated to breathing or heart rate. Small cranial pulsations can be felt with the fingertips. Restriction of movement of the cranial sutures (where the skull bones meet) interfere with the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord) and cause disease. Diseases can be diagnosed by detecting aberrations in this rhythm. Pain (especially of the jaw joint) and many other ailments can be remedied by pressing on the skull bones.

Craniosacral therapy (CST) is one of many terms used to describe a various methods based on fanciful claims that: - The human brain makes rhythmic movements at a rate of 10 to 14 cycles per minute, a periodicity unrelated to breathing or heart rate. - Small cranial pulsations can be felt with the fingertips. - Restriction of movement of the cranial sutures (where the skull bones meet) interfere with the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord) and cause disease. - Diseases can be diagnosed by detecting aberrations in this rhythm. - Pain (especially of the jaw joint) and many other ailments can be remedied by pressing on the skull bones. Most practitioners are osteopaths, massage therapists, chiropractors, dentists, or physical therapists. The other terms used to describe what they do include cranial osteopathy, cranial therapy, bio cranial therapy, and two chiropractic variants called craniopathy and sacro occipital technique (SOT). Dubious Claims Osteopaths attribute the origin of CST to osteopath William G. Sutherland (1873-1954), who published his first article on this subject in the early 1930s. From the mid-1970s onward, the leading proponent was John E. Upledger, D.O., who founded the [Upledger Institute](http://upledger.com/) of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Various Institute publications have claimed: - CranioSacral Therapy is a gentle, noninvasive manipulative technique. Seldom does the therapist apply pressure that exceeds five grams or the equivalent weight of a nickel. Examination is done by testing for movement in various parts of the system. Often, when movement testing is completed, the restriction has been removed and the system is able to self-correct [1]. - The rhythm of the craniosacral system can be detected in much the same way as the rhythms of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. But unlike those body systems, both evaluation and correction of the craniosacral system can be accomplished through palpation. CranioSacral Therapy is used for a myriad of health problems, including headaches, neck and back pain, TMJ dysfunction, chronic fatigue, motor-coordination difficulties, eye problems, endogenous depression, hyperactivity, attention deficit disorder, central nervous system disorders, and many other conditions [2]. - Practitioners today rely on CranioSacral Therapy to improve the functioning of the central nervous system, eliminate the negative effects of stress, strengthen resistance to disease, and enhance overall health [3]. From 2001 through the present time, the Institute Web site has stated: Using a soft touch generally no greater than 5 grams, or about the weight of a nickel, practitioners release restrictions in the craniosacral system to improve the functioning of the central nervous system. By complementing the body's natural healing processes, CST is increasingly used as a preventive health measure for its ability to bolster resistance to disease, and is effective for a wide range of medical problems associated with pain and dysfunction, including: migraine headaches; chronic neck and nervous cord disabilities; chronic fatigue; post-surgical dysfunction Upledger Institute has also advocated and taught \"visceral manipulation,\" a bizarre treatment system whose practitioners are claimed to detect \"rhythmic motions\" of the intestines and other internal organs and to manipulate them to \"improve the functioning of individual organs, the systems the organs function within, and the structural integrity of the entire body.\" [5] Upledger died in October 2012, but the institute will perpetuate his teachings. Some chiropractors claim that Nephi Cottam, D.C. introduced \"cranial adjusting\" (craniopathy) to the chiropractic world in 1929, several months before Sutherland publicly presented his methods. During the 1980s, a brochure distributed by his son Calvin Cottam, D.C., claimed that cranial adjustments had relieved pain between the shoulders, pain in the stomach (apparently from ulcers), indurated empyema. . .\" [6] Weird Beliefs Some of Upledger's assertions are among the strangest I have ever encountered. Chapter 2 of his book, CranoSacral Therapy: Touchstone of Natural Healing, describes how he discovered and communicates with what he calls the patient's \"Inner Physician\": By connecting deeply with a patient while doing CranioSacral Therapy, it was possible in most cases to solicit contact with the patient's Inner Physician. It also became clear that the Inner Physician could take any for m the patient could imagine \u2014an image, a voice or a feeling. Usually once the image of the Inner Physician appeared, it was ready to dialog with me and answer questions about the underlying causes of the patient's health problems and what can be done to resolve them. It also became clear that when the conversation with the Inner Physician was authentic, the craniosacral system went into a holding pattern [7]. The chapter goes on to describe Upledger's care of a four-month-old French baby who was \"as floppy as a rag doll.\" Although the baby had never been exposed to English, Upledger decided to see whether the baby's \"Inner Physician\" would communicate with him via the craniosacral system: I requested aloud in English that the craniosacral rhythm stop if the answer to a question was \"yes\" and not stop if the answer was \"no.\" The rhythm stopped for about ten seconds. I took this as an indication that I was being understood. I then asked if it was possible during this session for the rhythm to stop only in response to my question and not for other reasons, such as body position, etc., The rhythm stopped again. I was feeling more confident. I proceeded [7]. Using \"yes-no answers,\" Upledger says, he pinpointed the problem as \"a toxin that was inhaled by the mother . . . over a period of about two-and-a-half hours while cleaning the grease off an antique automobile engine\" during the fourth month of pregnancy. After \"asking many particulars\" about what he should do, Upledger was told to \"pump the parietal bones that form a large part of the roof of the skull, and to pass a lot of my energy through the brain from the back of the skull to the front.\" As he did this, Upledger frequently checked with the baby's \"Inner Physician.\" After about an hour, Upledger says, the baby began to move normally [7]. Two Deaths Reported Relying on CST instead of effective treatment can be dangerous. Moreover, its practice indicates poor judgement that may harm patients in other ways. At least two deaths associated with craniosacral therapy have been reported: - In 2003, a Pennsylvania chiropractor (Joann A. Gallagher) was convicted of insurance fraud in connection with the death of a 30-year-old epileptic woman whom she treated with cranial therapy. Court documents indicated that the patient died of severe seizures after following the chiropractor's advice to stop taking her anticonvulsive medication. The fraud involved submitting insurance claims falsely describing Upledger's \"meningeal balancing\" as spinal manipulation [8]. - In 2012, a Missouri dentist (Joseph H. Kerwin) had his license revoked for contributing to the death of a 2-day-old infant who had been brought to him because of a high fever. Records in the case indicate that instead of referring the parents to a medical facility, he manipulated the child's skull and applied a vibrating machine to his sacrum. The boy died 12 hours later, and the autopsy showed that he died from complications of a subdual hematoma (a blood clot that compressed his brain). The medical examiner concluded that the hematoma could have been present at birth but was more likely caused by the skull manipulation. The dental board concluded that Kerwin had acted outside the scope of dentistry [9]. Related Systems British osteopath Robert Boyd (1933-2014) developed a variant he called Bio Cranial Therapy, which\u2014according to the International Bio Cranial etc); and gastric disorders (hiatus hernia, ulceration, colitis); asthma and a of bronchiectasis and emphysema.\" [10] [Sacro-occiptal technique (SOT)](http://www.chirobase.org/05RB/BCC/11d.html) combines theories about spinal fluid pressure with chiropractic theories about spinal \"nerve pressure\" as a cause of ill health. Chiropractors who advocate SOT claim to detect \"blockages\" by feeling the skull and spine and measuring leg lengths [11]. The Scientific Viewpoint I do not believe that CST has any therapeutic value. Its underlying theory is false because the bones of the skull fuse by the end of adolescence and no research has ever demonstrated that manual manipulation can move the individual cranial bones [12]. Nor do I believe that \"the rhythms of the craniosacral system can be felt as clearly as the rhythms of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems,\" as is claimed by another Upledger Institute brochure [13]. The brain does pulsate, but this is exclusively related to the cardiovascular system [14], and no relationship between brain pulsation and general health has been demonstrated. Many years ago, three physical therapists who examined the same 12 patients diagnosed significantly different \"craniosacral rates,\" which is the expected outcome of measuring a nonexistent phenomenon [15]. Another study compared the \"craniosacral rate\" measured at the head and feet of 28 adults by two examiners and found that the results were highly inconsistent [16]. In 1999, after doing a comprehensive review of published studies, the British Columbia Office of Health Technology Assessment (BCOHTA) concluded that the theory is invalid and that practitioners cannot reliably measure what they claim to be modifying. The 68-page report concludes that \"there is insufficient evidence to recommend craniosacral therapy to patients, practitioners, or third party payers.\" [17] In 2011, the Archives of Disease in Childhood published the results of a well-designed randomized, controlled study of 142 children ages 5-12 with cerebral palsy. About half received cranial therapy (up to six sessions) and the others were placed on a \"waiting list.\" After six months, the researers found no difference between the treatment and no-treatment groups in gross motor function or the child's quality of life [18]. In 2002, two basic science professors at the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine concluded: Our own and previously published findings suggest that the proposed mechanism for cranial osteopathy is invalid and that interexaminer (and, therefore, diagnostic) reliability is approximately zero. Since no properly randomized, blinded, and placebo-controlled outcome studies have been published, we conclude that cranial osteopathy should be removed from curricula of colleges of osteopathic medicine and from osteopathic licensing examinations [12]. In 2005, one of the professors reported that despite their persistent effort, craniosacral therapy and its \"imaginary biology\" were still taught in all of the DO schools in the United States and questions about it remained on DO licensing exams [19]. In 2016, a French research team that a comprehensive review of the scientific literature concluded: \"Our results demonstrate, consistently with those of previous reviews, that methodologically strong evidence on the reliability of diagnostic procedures and the efficacy of techniques and therapeutic strategies in cranial osteopathy is almost non-existent.\" [20] I certainly agree! In fact, I believe that most practitioners of craniosacral therapy have such poor judgment that they should be delicensed. Related Articles - Jarvis WT.

Quackwatch, Jan 26, 2003. |Reader Comment | As a physical therapist and exercise physiologist, I'd like to thank you for your article on \"craniosacral therapy\". Too many patients and therapists have been duped by this so-called therapy. If these therapist were ever to suggest to any self-respecting neurosurgeon, that they could move the sutures of the skull with ounces of force, they would get laughed right out of the room. I have personally witnessed how saws and drills are needed (with more than a few ounces of force) to alter the structure of the adult skull. To tell patients that you have the ability to analyze the cerebral spinal fluid flow with your fingertips and then \"normalize\" it by mobilizing the cranial sutures is not just quackery but malpractice. They should lose their license. References - Discover CranioSacral Therapy. Undated flyer distributed in 1997 by the Upledger Institute. - Upledger CranioSacral Therapy I.
