Naturopathic Medicine achieves a deeper level of healing by emphasizing balance through the stimulation, enhancement, and support of the inherent healing capacity of the patient. Naturopathic Medicine uses therapies that are safe and effective. The human body possesses the inherent ability to restore health. The physician's role is to facilitate this process with the aid of natural and nontoxic therapies. Physicians seek and treat the underlying cause of a disease. They view symptoms as expressions of the body's natural attempt to heal. The origin of the disease is removed or treated so the patient can recover. Physicians consider the multiple factors in health and disease while treating the whole person. Physicians provide flexible treatment programs to meet individual health care needs. The physician's major role is to educate, empower, and motivate patients to take responsibility for their own health, because knowledge is true power. Creating a healthy, cooperative relationship with the patient has a strong therapeutic value. Naturopathic physicians are preventive medicine specialists. Physicians assess patient risk factors and heredity susceptibility and intervene appropriately to reduce risk and prevent illness. Prevention of disease is best accomplished through education and a lifestyle that supports health. Naturopathic medicine's ultimate goal is to establish and maintain optimum health and balance. Wellness is a state of health characterized by positive emotion, action, and thought. Licensed Naturopathic Physicians are trained to serve as primary care general practitioners with expertise in the prevention, management, and treatment of both acute and chronic health conditions. Michigan has yet to recognize NDs as primary care or licensed physicians, and legislation is being presented to change this. Yes, it is very safe. One of the primary goals of naturopathic medicine is \"First Do No Harm.\" The goal is to help you feel better without causing harm or uncomfortable side effects. This is especially true when it comes to the side effects of pharmaceutical drugs and the negative impact they can have on other areas of the body outside the area they intended to treat. NDs are also trained to look at the body as a whole and analyze the effects of how one system or blockage can have far-reaching effects upon other systems or areas of health. They make sure all systems operate in harmony as a whole. Naturopathic Doctors, like other medical doctors, first must complete their premedical undergraduate studies. After that, they complete a 4-year doctorate-level medical training from one of five recognized schools in North America. Similar to the curriculum at a conventional medical school, the first two years of naturopathic medicine are focused on obtaining an in-depth understanding of the function and development of disease in the body. No. This can be dangerous and misleading as Naturopaths receive only months of training. Naturopaths can receive training from many sources, even online, that may result in a certificate or specialty in a form of alternative medicine. This can be a public safety issue if they are represented as Doctors when their education lacks the medical training. Naturopathic medicine uses a broader strategy than conventional medicine. The goal for patients is the restoration of their overall health, and not just the improvement of their symptoms, as is the case in conventional medicine. Dr. Cutler gets to the root by creating balance and using treatments that stimulate the natural healing mechanisms of the body. There are now medical doctors who are making the switch to Natural Medicine, and they do so by taking weekend courses in holistic health. This is a very different case than a truly trained Naturopathic Doctor. No. Initially all ND's graduate from a four-year medical program. After, they can go on to get additional training in a field of specialty. Dr. Cutler has continued his education in Environmental Medicine and is one of the only Naturopathic Doctors in Michigan to specialize in this field. Naturopathic Doctors can see most chronic, and certain acute conditions.

Yes, in most places where Naturopathic Medicine is prevalent, people have an MD along with an ND. Naturopathic medicine works very well when used in conjunction with other forms of medicine. Dr. Cutler will put together an individualized plan that will work with your current condition, needs, and goals.
