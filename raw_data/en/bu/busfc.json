Items of Interest: 1. High Dose Class IV Laser Treatment now available at our office.

Begin again a fitness regiment - don't do too much too soon. Start power walking 15 minutes at a time once a day - every other day add 2 minutes until you reach 25 minutes. Start slow to be successful. We find success is building lifestyle habits that are attainable. Weightloss tip #1 - Weight yourself daily - at the same time each day. Chart and evaluate. Look for patterns. Eat mindfully! 3. Healthy lifestyles require healthy habits. Prepare to be successful by starting with planning your foods and snacks. Think Nuts, Seeds, Vegetables and Fruit for snacks. Prepack your snacks to grab and go. Grazing is helpful for blood sugar stability. 4. CBD - Is it for me? Ask your chiropractor about the benefits of this non-THC product. Formats range from CBD oil to CBD Protien drinks to CBD gems (gummies). Whether it is used as a sleep aid, anxiety support or pain modulator, CBD has been effective for many patients. Ask the doctors if this could be helpful for you. As always, if you have any questions about diet, exercise, skeletal health, we are available for consultations.
