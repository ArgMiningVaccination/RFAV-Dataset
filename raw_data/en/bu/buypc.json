How do they cope? For many, it's all about finding that all-important me-time - getting away for a few precious days to re-ground and refocus their practice and priorities, to maximise their future life potential with the help of bio-energetics, some cellular-resonance treatment, phyto mud wraps, Balinese massage, chanting (chanting's always good, as long as it's indigenous chanting), and plenty of traditional medicine - preferably Chinese, of course, because Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treats the whole person, not just the symptom, and they can diagnose your ailments by feeling your pulse - a skill which few Western doctors can hope to emulate. As the Sunday Times inform us, in this handy guide to the [best spas on the planet](http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/body_and_soul/article6964998.ece?token=null&offset=0&page=1) (on the planet? I blame David Attenborough), almost two in five people in the highest income brackets have taken a specific spa holiday in the past three years. \"In fact, it's reaching the point where spas are considered by many to be a necessity\". Indeed. Let's start with Mia Aimaro Ogden, as she visits James Giuseppi's Shunya, in Ibiza: Shunya is a Tachyon centre (it's a quantum-physics thing, but, in yogic terms, it means that there's an incredible energy here) run by Karar Moeller and Sabera Martin... Giuseppi's practice is hatha-based, with elements of sivananda and astanga, and his classes are tailored to individual needs. He came to yoga from the City and chronic back pain, so he understands the challenges of a high-pressure environment. Giuseppi is a firm believer in the theory that the universe will give you what you need, when you need it \u2014 and I really needed a week away from a boyfriend with a leg in plaster. Call me heartless, but I was worn down, and the discipline of four hours' yoga a day helped me refocus my practice and my priorities. And despite second helpings at every meal, I somehow managed to lose weight. Well done Mia! But it's not for everyone... \u00a3975 for the Ibiza retreat might seem like a lot, but for 25 hours of yoga tuition and a delicious organic diet, it's a jolly good deal. Next up, Linda Burrows visits Espace Henri Chenot at Palace Merano, Italy: The spa's philosophy To create wellbeing, balance and understanding of the body through diet, Chinese medicine and Taoist principles. The programme The comprehensive Henri Chenot programme consists of a seven-day detox diet, a toxaemia-level test, a BMI test, a \"bio-energetic\" checkup, four cellular-resonance treatments, six tendon and muscle massages, hydrotherapy, phyto mud wraps and hydro massages. How was it for me? This year has been a bit of a roller-coaster ride and I needed some me-time. I certainly got it at Espace Henri Chenot... You get to know your body inside and out: a blood test revealed I was allergic to eggs and a body scan showed good calcium levels in my bones. You are given a folder, containing your medical history and the results of any tests, which is consulted before treatment starts. All products are from the Henri Chenot laboratory. The food was delicious: no meat, eggs, alcohol or dairy. It was well balanced and imaginatively presented \u2014 not once did I feel hungry \u2014 and I would highly recommend the cooking class, which is included in the price of the package. The luxurious hotel is full of fur-coated Italian ladies with their pooches and high-powered businessmen. By the end of the week, I had lost more than 4lb, felt regenerated and my skin was glowing.... Details A week's stay at Palace Merano is \u00a33,452... Laurel Ives heads for La Reserve Ramatuelle, near St Tropez: Guests are encouraged to embark upon a six-day programme to lose weight, reduce stress and reinvent their lifestyle, under the supervision of a doctor who \"maximises the future life potential of each individual\" (and all for about \u00a32,325). There is also a menu of individual treatments for weekenders \u2014 anti-ageing is a big focus, as it's the only spa in France to offer Cr\u00e8me de la Mer treatments. Is there a top spa in China? Of course there's a top spa in China. Joanna McGarry visits: Mandarin Oriental, Sanya, on the southern tip of Hainan island, is all about maximising both its location and local expertise in the growing global beauty trend towards traditional Chinese medicine. TCM, as it's widely known, centres on treating the entire body, as opposed to specific areas of concern. The spa is the first in the world to boast a licensed TCM doctor on site, who aims to diagnose physical ailments by feeling your pulse.... Your time is your own at Sanya, though after your diagnosis, treatments are then prescribed, including acupuncture and acupressure massage. Ziao, the onsite doctor, has 18 years' experience and, for added authenticity, speaks no English, so a translator is also present... The TCM doctor is a huge draw, and Master Hu, a resident Shaolin master, teaches traditional martial arts, including t'ai chi and qi gong, and offers his own unique Chinese tea ceremony, which fuses meditation with traditional tasting. The Chinese massages are world class (firm, but not too tough) and leave you purged of aches and psychological stresses. If you prefer, there are also resident Balinese and Thai masseuses. Finally, let's hear from Edwina Ings-Chambers, who visits the Constance Halaveli resort in the Maldives: My treatments ranged from spiritual to ancient (including chants played or spoken throughout) and practised by specialists from as far afield as Bali and India \u2014 one of whom can even seem to read your thoughts and help set them straight afterwards. All treatment rooms come complete with glass-covered holes in the floor, so you can watch the fish swimming by as you lie face-down, which helps to switch off a worrying mind. My one-to-one yoga instruction was so inspiring, I kept up my personalised routine after I got home. From glass ceilings to glass holes... "}
