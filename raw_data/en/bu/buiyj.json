SUMMARY KEYWORDS essential oils, heavy metals, grapefruit, body, toxins, oils, sulfur, heavy metal toxicities, talk, foods, carrier oil, air, test, diffusing, cilantro, soles, bloodstream, stimulate, rebounder, atlas 00:01 Hey everybody, it's Dr. Sam and I want to welcome you to another EyeClarity Podcast. Today I want to talk about heavy metal detox using essential oils. This is one of my most popular posts, which I've done on TikTok. But I want to elaborate a little further and talk about the application of essential oils with toxicities. So we know that toxins are in our air, our foods, and our water supply. And I wanted to offer a simple way that works really well to remove these from my body. Now I've done clinical research using essential oils because what I like to do is a test called a hair mineral analysis. And it's a biochemistry test that gives us a snapshot of what's going on in our trace mineral levels, or heavy metal toxicities, and our body metabolism. And it's not 100% accurate, but it does give a really good indicator of what a person's body is doing to adapt to stress. So in working with over 5000 patients, and measuring and charting their heavy metals, I use this protocol to help them regain their health. So I'd like to share this with you today. The big heavy metals include lead aluminum, copper, and mercury. And it's important that you be aware of dental fillings that are maybe wearing out cooking utensils, household products, exposure to plastics, farmed fish, and contaminated water. Some of the symptoms of heavy metal toxicities could be things like digestive issues, sleep problems, headaches, anxiety, hypertension, depression, memory issues, and light sensitivity to name a few. And I have found essential oils can actually help key late these toxins out of the body. So here are my top four. Number one is grapefruit. And this helps cleanse the liver and it also stimulates the lymphatic system. Now I talk a lot about the importance of having healthy lymph. And if you're like me and you sit in front of the screen for some of the day, most of the day, it's very important to get out walk, jump on a rebounder, get some bodywork cranial sacral massage or something to stimulate your lymphatic health. So grapefruit is really a great one for that. Number two on my list is Cedarwood Atlas. So this is gently stimulating and effects and helps break down and eliminate toxins in the body. It's a natural anti-inflammatory oil that supports the adrenals and it just it's a really good one for me. Number three is phenol. This is I call this the purifier purifies the bloodstream, and cleans the kidneys and other vital organs. And it also helps get rid of heavy metals, uric acid, and other toxic substances. And my number four I know you've heard of this. It's called cilantro, you can actually get it in essential oil. It's a major detoxifier of heavy metals and it provides the body with anti-oxidants that help get rid of oxidative stress. So how to apply these will diffuse get a diffuser and you can put some of the essential oils in the diffuser. This creates negative ions which freshen the air and inhibits bacterial growth. And also the big one about diffusing is it helps increase oxygen flow through our respiratory system which will promote detoxification. Probably the most common way is to apply it on your skin and the skin is one of the largest organs if not the largest organ where toxins get released from the body. We see this with rashes and you know red spots. You know you're on the right track. When you start seeing these blotches come out after you use the oils. 04:54 Now for some people using essential oils directly on your skin, there's just too intense. So you can use a carrier oil, or you can put them on the soles of your feet. And if you're going to use this lineup of grapefruit, cedar of grapefruit, Cedarwood, Atlas, fennel, and cilantro, that you could put these on the soles of your feet two to four drops, you know, two to three times a day, I would say at least two times a day would be a good prescription. So you're getting enough of it in the bloodstream. You can always do a test patch to make sure that the essential oils are not irritating, I like to do that on the inside part of my arm just below my wrist. That's a way that you can see if the oils are going to be sensitive to you. And again, you're perfectly okay to find a carrier oil and use it that way. The third application is internally you can actually buy capsules that have essential oils in them, but you need to check with your doctor first. Whenever you do essential oils internally, it's important to get a baseline on your bloodwork. And you know to find out you know what's going on in your health before you do internal. Now some other things I'd like to add would be folate, vitamin B 12, B six sulfur-containing foods like kale, garlic, onions, and collards. This sulfur food as you probably know from my MSM eye drops, which is a sulfur molecule, these will enhance your liver. I also think it's important to do cardio exercises to induce more sweat, you could do something like an infrared sauna. So in summary, heavy metals are inevitable using essential oils is an effective, gentle way to help return your body to balance and harmony. So that's our show for today.
