Since ancient time people consume different beverages and have attributed health benefits without any scientific basis. Beverages or drinks are liquid preparations used for human consumption worldwide in daily life. Beverages are classified as alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverages including beer, wine, cider and sprits; nonalcoholic beverages including soft drinks like soda pop, sparkling water, iced tea, lemonade, root beer, fruit punch, milk, hot chocolate, tea, coffee, milkshakes, energy drinks, juice, and carbohydrate drink, have been part of human culture. Water itself is often not classified as beverage but water is the chief constituent of all the beverages that maintain body electrolyte level and responsible for change in volume of blood circulation. Complete removal of water cause death faster than other substance. Some of these beverages are use as a traditional medicine for the treatment of chronic and acute diseases. Tea contains theobromine,... Iranian Journal of Basic Medical Sciences 2020 It is well documented that life expectancy in developed countries at birth is going to increase from the 20th century. However, regrettably, a potential decline in life expectancy has been proposed for these nations in the 21st century due to a rapid upsurge in the prevalence of fatal degenerative diseases like cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cancer and diabetes. Collectively, these three diseases accounted for 65% of all deaths in urbanized societies and considered as a dynamic issue for shortening the genetically determined lifespan through increased mortalities, morbidities, disabilities, immense sufferings, and premature aging. These fatal degenerative diseases and premature aging are closely associated with oxidative stress produced by the free radicals in the body. In epidemiologic studies, flavonoid-rich foods (FRF) like fruits, vegetables, and beverages have been associated as protective agents against these diseases. These also have been observed for their geroprotective effects and help in preventing the premature aging and the deterioration of brain function, which is related to Alzheimer's disease and dementia. In this review, we presented a comprehensive overview of the FRF for their potential role against lifespan-shortening complications, i.e., CVD, cancer, and diabetes. We also had drawn the future perspective and dietary guidelines to reduce the fatal diseases burden in urban populations. A combination of the words \"nutrition\" and \"pharmaceutical,\" the term nutraceutical encompasses foods or food products that claim to prevent chronic diseases, improve health, delay the aging process, and/or increase life expectancy. Products in this category range from isolated nutrients, dietary supplements and specific diets to genetically engineered foods, herbal products, and processed foods such as cereals and beverages.The area of Nutraceuticals is relevantly new and hence this publication serves to be most vital for scholars studying pharmaceutical sciences and related disciplines and as a reference for college freshman intending to have more understanding of this emerging area. This book by Dr. Muredzi sets the tone for future editions and serves to give an enlightened introduction to this emerging discipline. Eng.Q.C. Kanhukamwe - Vice Chancellor; Harare Institute of Technology, Harare, Zimbabwe Systematic Review on Polyphenol Intake and Health Outcomes: Is there Sufficient Evidence to Define a Health-Promoting Polyphenol-Rich Dietary Pattern 2019 Growing evidence support association between polyphenol intake and reduced risk for chronic diseases, even if there is a broad debate about the effective amount of polyphenols able to exert such protective effect. The present systematic review provides an overview of the last 10-year literature on the evaluation of polyphenol intake and its association with specific disease markers and/or endpoints. An estimation of the mean total polyphenol intake has been performed despite the large heterogeneity of data reviewed. In addition, the contribution of dietary sources was considered, suggesting tea, coffee, red wine, fruit and vegetables as the main products providing polyphenols. Total flavonoids and specific subclasses, but not total polyphenols, have been apparently associated with a low risk of diabetes, cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. However, large variability in terms of methods for the evaluation and quantification of polyphenol intake, markers and endpoints considered, makes it still difficult to establish an evidence-based reference intake for the whole class and subclass of compounds. Nevertheless, the critical mass of data available seem to strongly suggest the protective effect of a polyphenol-rich dietary pattern even if further well targeted and methodologically sound research should be encouraged in order to define specific recommendations.
