Tui na massage is a form of Chinese massage that allows us to open up physical blockages in the muscular/skeletal framework of our bodies. Tong Ren Healing is a form of energy healing developed by Tom Tam, while he was practicing acupuncture in the Boston area. Tom Tam is the chief Tai Chi instructor at the Tam Healing Center and has been practicing and teaching tai chi for over 30 years. The Lea Tam Acupuncture Center was established in Boston in 1982 by husband and wife Lea Tam and Tom Tam, both Chinese immigrants who arrived in the United States to start a new life. Since 2013, the clinic has been managed by siblings Bell Tam and Yvonne Tam, both whom are licensed acupuncturists. Lea and Tom Tam are retired from acupuncture. Bell and Yvonne are second generation acupuncturists who have served as apprentices in the clinic learning from both Tom and Lea from a very young age. Both Bell and Yvonne hold a Master's Degree in Acupuncture.
