When done with the right support from an acupuncturist near me, detoxing can help improve your digestion, immune function, fertility, and many other aspects of your health. Store bought colon cleanse products or a juice cleanse won't really do the job, though. A [detox program with acupuncture](https://myartofwellness.com/new-years-cleaning-detox/) and Chinese herbs will do more to optimize your health than just a [detox diet](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/detox-diets-why-to-do-one-what-to-eat) will. When we recommend our Detox Program at Art of Wellness, we are not talking about fasting or detox drinks, like a master cleanse. The goal of our program is to detoxify the organ systems of the body: it's a liver detox, kidney cleanse, lungs, heart, and spleen. This is a [full body cleanse](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-detox-your-body#1.-Limit-Alcohol) designed to give you a health reset. According to TCM philosophy, your body knows how to repair and renew itself, but it cannot do this job when it is congested and out of balance. In TCM, we have a broad concept of what \"toxins\" are and how they can affect our bodies and our health. Toxic chemicals that come from our [environment](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18075622/), such as food additives, pesticides, cleaning products, and [beauty and hygiene products](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/features/harmful-chemicals-in-personal-care-products/) are certainly part of the problem. Drugs, medicines, alcohol, and unhealthy foods can also be toxic. So can behavioral habits, like sitting and looking at our [screens and devices](https://www.verywellmind.com/why-and-how-to-do-a-digital-detox-4771321) too long. But our own bodies produce toxins, too. The waste products our organs create are \"toxic,\" and if they are held in the body too long without being adequately cleared out, they can negatively impact organ function. Imbalances in the system can cause conditions of excess heat or phlegm, which can lead to all kinds of problems with both your physical and [mental health](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-improve-mental-health-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). [Stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), lack of sleep, and extreme emotions can also contribute to toxic conditions in the body and mind. When the organ systems are out of balance, the body is under constant pressure to keep functioning, but we do not feel our best. Signs you need to detox include: [Fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), low energy, tired all the time - Foggy head, [memory problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [trouble concentrating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Constipation - Trouble sleeping, [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/) - Weight gain - Hair loss - Hormone imbalances - Signs of rapid aging - Skin rash, [acne](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-acne-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Fingernails are brittle, lined symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/menopause/) retention, edema, swelling in extremities [Inflammation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-reduce-and-prevent-inflammation/) is largely created by toxic conditions in the body, and most pain conditions and chronic illnesses stem, at least in part, from inflammation somewhere. Why You Need a Liver Detox In conventional medicine, we think of the liver as being a sort of filter that removes toxins from the blood and helps metabolize fat. In TCM theory, we consider the liver to be the storehouse and distributor of blood; therefore, it also plays a crucial role in the menstrual cycle. The liver is also strongly connected to a person's emotional life. Stress, lack of sleep, too much sugar, alcohol, fatty, fried foods, pharmaceutical medicines, and recreational drugs all tax the liver above and beyond what it needs to do just to keep the blood flowing to nourish the body. When too many demands are placed on the liver, it can cause all kinds of symptoms, including: fatigue, insomnia, and headaches. Feelings of anger, frustration, anxiety, and irritability may arise. Conversely, when a person is feeling bitter and resentful, and isn't able to express it, those unresolved emotions may begin to cause trouble with liver function. Just as the liver governs the blood, in TCM, the kidneys govern the water of the body, controlling elimination through the bladder, and maintaining [blood pressure](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/hypertension/) by keeping the right amount of water in the bloodstream. Signs that the kidneys are not balanced include: [problems with blood pressure](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/), edema, puffiness in the face or extremities, [UTIs](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-uti-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), chronic fatigue, and [menopause symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menopause-symptoms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), like dryness and hot flashes. Detoxing the organ systems, including the liver and kidneys especially, can help rejuvenate the digestion and allow better nutrition to reach all parts of the body, as the quality and flow of blood and other bodily fluids will be improved. Making sure that your excretory system is in good working order before starting a cleanse is important. If you are already having problems with constipation, for example, we will want to make sure we get things moving before we start cleansing the organs. Our detox also focuses on the body's largest excretory organ: the skin. Top 10 Reasons To Detox It is a good idea for everyone to detox periodically; detoxing every six months is reasonable for most people. Sometimes we will specifically recommend a detox for a patient when they are struggling with a particular health problem, or if they are planning a [pregnancy](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/pregnancy-support/). Detoxing can help: - Boost Immunity - a cleanse will help get your lymphatic system, which produces and transports immune cells and removes waste from cells, moving, improving the efficacy of your immune system. - Break Free From [Addiction](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-addiction-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)- if you are ready, a commitment to the detox program and food plan can help you end patterns of [substance abuse](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5153313/), drug use, alcohol addiction, [smoking](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-quit-smoking-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and other types of dependency. [Infertility](https://myartofwellness.com/infertility-faqs/)- We often advise people who come to Art of Wellness for [fertility treatment](https://myartofwellness.com/fertility-treatment-plans/)to begin with the Detox Program. Not only will this help increase the chances of conception occurring, whether naturally or with the aid of ART, but it will also lay the foundation for your child's health in the future. [Improve sleep](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)- This works both ways. In order for the body to do its routine daily work of removing toxic waste, it needs plenty of sleep. The Liver, in particular, is working hard through the night to clean and deliver fresh blood to the cells. Sleeping on your side enhances your body's ability to do this work, allowing the internal organs to drain properly. When your body is functioning well, your sleep will be of better quality, more restful and refreshing. [Improve skin](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-aging-skin-with-cosmetic-acupuncture/)and hair - Dull eyes and skin, dark circles or bags, puffiness, and thinning hair are signs of stagnant blood and Qi. Nutrients from the right foods and Chinese herbs help to nourish the skin, and clear heat, dampness, and dryness. When old cells are removed, hair and eyes can shine again. Acupuncture treatment can help [stimulate collagen](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1475-925X-7-19)production, which also happens while you sleep. - Weight loss - While our acupuncture detox is not about how to lose belly fat fast, many people will find that it gives them a good foundation for new eating habits. Detoxing the liver and kidneys will help your body metabolize fat better. - Balance hormones - severe [PMS symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), stomach](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)and mood [infertility in men (oligospermia)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-oligospermia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)can all be improved when hormone function improves. Acupuncture treatment can also help relieve conditions like [PCOS](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-pcos-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [fibroids/leiomyoma](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-leiomyoma-of-the-uterus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [endometriosis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-painful-periods-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/)for women, and [BPH in men](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bph-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - Reduce inflammation - many illnesses and pain conditions are inflammatory in nature.

We treat many conditions with acupuncture and herbs, such support for people going through [cancer treatment](https://myartofwellness.com/acupuncture-and-tcm-for-cancer-integrative-oncology/). 7 Steps of Detox Program With TCM Acupuncture and Herbs Pain and dysfunction occur when there is imbalance and when there are areas of stagnation within the body. Think of the metaphor of a house that needs to be deep-cleaned; there are dark corners of the body that have been ignored for a while, where dust and cobwebs have gathered. The Detox program reaches into these pockets of stagnation, sweeps them clean, and makes sure they get some fresh air and sunlight shining on them, in the form of invigorated Qi and blood. - Acupuncture Treatments - the primary goal of acupuncture treatments during the detox phase is to get Qi moving freely, remove blockages, and to assist in elimination of toxins from the body. - Cupping Treatment - the TCM modality of cupping creates a vacuum-like suction that moves Qi and blood from the innermost parts of the body outwards. During the detox program, cupping helps to pull toxins out of the lungs and other organs. - Detox Herbs - the Chinese herb detox tea helps to clear heat and toxins from the body and improve digestion and elimination. - Foot Pad Detox - detox foot patches, worn as you sleep at night and removed in the morning, help to pull toxins and fatty deposits from the body. - Detox Bath - Sweating is an excellent way to remove toxins through the skin; this is why so many traditions rely on saunas and hot baths. Our herbal sachets allow you to enjoy a therapeutic herbal soak in your own bathtub. - Exercise - Your acupuncturist will instruct you on how to practice daily exercises, based on QiGong movements, that will help to get Qi and blood moving. - Nutrition - the food plan during the detox is based on whole grains, lean proteins, and plenty of vegetables, flooding your system with nutrients.

Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on Qi, which is an invisible force that usually cannot be observed by modern science.

[ How to Treat Mononucleosis With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-mononucleosis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) & Qineng Tan, Ph.D. Fatigue, fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, rash? These might be mono symptoms. [Mononucleosis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mononucleosis/expert-answers/mononucleosis/faq-20058444), often referred to as \"mono,\" is an illness caused by the [Epstein Barr virus](https://www.cdc.gov/epstein-barr/about-ebv.html), also known as \"EBV.\" Epstein Barr is a very common contagious virus. An EBV infection sometimes leads to mononucleosis symptoms. Acupuncture and TCM herbs can help relieve mono symptoms in adults, teens, and children. Mononucleosis is an infectious disease caused by the Epstein Barr virus. EBV is one of the family of herpes viral infections. Most people (over 90%) are infected with EBV at some time in their lives, but many aren't aware of it. How is mono contagious? Epstein Barr spreads through body fluids, especially saliva. This is why mononucleosis is sometimes called the \"kissing disease.\" You can catch EBV by sharing a cup or bottle, for example. It can also be spread through sexual contact, sharing needles, blood transfusions, or organ transplants. The Epstein Barr virus can be present for several weeks before a person starts showing any mononucleosis symptoms. Often people will have the virus, but not show any Epstein Barr symptoms at all. During that time, they may be contagious and able to pass the virus to others. Mono symptoms can take a while to develop, and may not be recognized right away as anything other than a [simple cold](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-the-common-cold-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) or flu. For some people, especially children, EPV will cause a short-term illness that seems like a common cold. However, some people, especially teenagers and young adults, will develop mononucleosis, which causes serious [fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and other symptoms. [Mono](https://www.cdc.gov/epstein-barr/about-mono.html) may clear up in a few weeks, but for some people it can drag on for months. Sometimes mononucleosis turns into a [long-standing illness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6518816/), causing extreme fatigue that just doesn't seem to want to go away. As with other viruses, like [herpes simplex](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-herpes-simplex-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) or varicella/chicken pox, which can later lead to [shingles](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shingles-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), EBV can stay in the body in a dormant state for a long time. Some people with weakened immune systems may have EBV reactivate and cause illness again, or cause them to be contagious to others again. It is now believed that reactivation of the Epstein Barr virus may be an underlying cause that contributes to some chronic autoimmune disorders, like [ME/CFS (chronic fatigue is really no specific medical mono treatment. Doctors and patients will usually treat it the same as they would a cold, recommending rest and over the counter medicines to reduce fever and pain while they wait it out. Acupuncture and Chinese herbs offer a more comprehensive way to deal with the fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and muscle aches associated with [mononucleosis](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/infectious-mononucleosis). TCM treatment can also boost the immune system so that an Epstein Barr viral infection doesn't lead to more serious illness or autoimmune disorders later on. Top 10 Mononucleosis Symptoms Many people contract the Epstein Barr virus and are never aware of it, either because they experience no [symptoms](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/mono.html), or the symptoms are similar to those of a mild cold or flu. How do you know if you have mono? Mononucleosis symptoms develop differently in each individual, but the most common Epstein Barr symptoms include: - Fatigue, extreme fatigue, tired all the time, exhausted, feeling weak - Foggy head, [difficulty concentrating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Sore throat](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-a-sore-throat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Swollen lymph nodes, swollen glands in the neck and armpits - Fever, high fever [Headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Rash, skin rash, mono rash, viral rash - Loss of appetite, no appetite [Muscle pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-musculoskeletal-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [joint pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-arthritis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Abdominal pain, swollen spleen, enlarged spleen, enlarged liver Mono affects the liver and spleen, sometimes causing swelling, jaundice, and even a kind of temporary mono [hepatitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hepatitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). In rare cases, EBV can cause serious liver problems, leading to [acute liver failure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5040549/), and the need for a liver transplant. EBV can also cause further complications, like swollen tonsils, [anemia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anemia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), low blood platelet count, and inflammation of the heart. Epstein Barr sometimes leads to other nervous system disorders, like: [viral meningitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-meningitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [encephalitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-encephalitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), Barr virus](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/treating-the-sneaky-epstein-barr-virus/) can provide a natural remedy for mononucleosis symptoms, and work to strengthen the immune system, as well as the liver and spleen. Can Acupuncture Help Mono? We now know that mononucleosis is caused by a specific viral infection. Most people get this virus, but relatively few people have a full-blown case of mononucleosis. Most people who do get mono have it when they are teenagers, or in college. Why do some people get mono and others don't? It has to do with the immune system. People who have a weakened immune system are more likely to get mono, and more likely to have mono for a long time. In some cases, the virus takes a deep hold in the body, and can be triggered again some time later, causing more illness. Acupuncture and TCM healing modalities can work well for diseases that can be hard to treat with conventional medicine. Chinese herbs and acupuncture treatment can help address the specific cold and flu-like symptoms of mono, like sore throat, fever, headache, muscle ache, headaches, and skin rash. Acupuncture treatment can also help to restore normal function of the spleen and liver. Finally, acupuncture treatment can be used as an ongoing preventive care to build up the immune system. This means also taking steps to address mental and emotional well-being. It is now understood that autoimmune disorders can be triggered by life [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), mental health disorders like [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) or [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or [post-traumatic stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ptsd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). This means, if a person has had EBV, has weakened immunity, and then goes through some difficult period, event, loss, or illness, they may have an increased chance of developing an autoimmune disorder, like chronic fatigue. By taking a proactive attitude in addressing Epstein Barr and mononucleosis, and working holistically to address underlying problems with the immune system, TCM herbs and acupuncture treatment can help prevent EBV from showing up later in the form of an autoimmune disorder. Not much scientific research has yet been done to show how acupuncture helps EBV or mono. However, more medical [doctors are beginning to recognize](https://www.everydayhealth.com/news/not-getting-better-eastern-medicine-may-help/) that Eastern medicine can offer benefits for illnesses like mononucleosis, Epstein Barr, and other diseases. One [clinical study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24672940/) of children treated with conventional medicine versus TCM herbal formulations showed that the herbs helped children recover from EBV symptoms like swollen tonsils more quickly. Acupuncture Near Me for Mononucleosis/Epstein Barr Virus - West Los Angeles TCM has developed methods for treating illnesses of all kinds over many centuries; the paradigm for categorizing diseases and what causes them is different than that in Western medicine. Thus, we are able to look at each person's symptoms and constitution on an individual basis, and provide treatment so that they feel better and their organ systems actually get stronger. The doctors at Art of Wellness have over 35 years of experience helping people overcome lengthy illnesses and chronic fatigue. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Celiac Disease With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-celiac-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [bloated and abdominal pain? Unintentional weight loss, fatigue, rashes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dermatitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)? These can all be signs of [Celiac disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352220). Different from food allergies, [Celiac](https://www.beyondceliac.org/celiac-disease/gut-reaction-video/how-celiac-disease-is-triggered/) is a serious autoimmune disorder that can lead to malnutrition and other debilitating health problems. TCM herbs and acupuncture treatment offer a good alternative way of managing Celiac disease and [gluten intolerance](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=32696) symptoms. In recent years, you have probably heard a lot of people saying they are switching to a gluten free diet because they have a gluten allergy or gluten intolerance. Sometimes people may just be trying to see if they feel better when they cut out wheat products, or they are going on a low carb diet to help them lose weight. Other people may be experiencing symptoms like diarrhea and nausea and hope that going on an [IBS diet](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-manage-ibs-diet-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) will help. What is gluten? Gluten is a protein that is present in some grains, including wheat, barley, and rye. When a person has Celiac disease, gluten is perceived by the immune system as a dangerous foreign substance, triggering an immune response. Antibodies (white blood cells) are produced as a reaction to gluten entering the body, and the antibodies end up causing inflammation and damage to the inside of the intestinal tract. This damage to the small intestine is called villous atrophy, and this is what causes inflammation and malabsorption of nutrients, leading to the myriad symptoms of Celiac. Celiac symptoms vary widely, and can include both digestive problems, and other conditions, like anemia, that stem from the lack of proper nourishment to the body. There is such a thing as a true [wheat allergy,](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/wheat-allergy/symptoms-causes/syc-20378897) which for some people causes respiratory problems like [difficulty breathing](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-asthma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and nasal congestion, and other [allergy symptoms](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-allergy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) like swelling and itching around the mouth and throat, [hives](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hives-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) or other itchy skin rashes, and [headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Wheat allergies are a response to chemical compounds in wheat, which is found in a wide variety of food products. In some cases, exposure to wheat can cause anaphylaxis, which requires emergency medical attention because it can involve trouble breathing and swallowing, chest tightening, throat swelling, [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and fainting. Some doctors now recognize [gluten intolerance](https://www.verywellhealth.com/gluten-sensitivity-vs-celiac-disease-562964) or non-celiac gluten sensitivity as a separate condition from Celiac disease. For some people, gluten causes an immune response and symptoms, but not the same kind of damage to the intestines that Celiac does. If gluten intolerance is suspected, then following a gluten free diet for a period of time and noticing if symptoms clear up is usually the recommended course of action. Celiac disease tends to run in families, and so is considered to be passed genetically. People can begin to show signs of Celiac at any age. It is [estimated](https://www.beyondceliac.org/celiac-disease/facts-and-figures/) that at least 1% of the population has Celiac disease, but that number may be significantly higher, as it is still not a very well understood condition. Many people who have Celiac disease are unaware of it, or have been misdiagnosed with other conditions. Researchers believe that the incidence of Celiac disease is increasing worldwide, probably due to some environmental factors. Acupuncture and TCM herbs provide a holistic way to treat Celiac disease, relieving the painful symptoms and providing detailed guidance for lifestyle and dietary changes that can help people manage Celiac and gluten intolerance. Nutrition is considered to be one of the primary branches of TCM, along with acupuncture and herbs. A TCM practitioner will be able to give you dietary recommendations far beyond just telling you to eat gluten free foods. Top 10 Celiac Disease Symptoms People can experience a variety of gluten intolerance symptoms, including digestive problems, allergy symptoms like skin rash, and other symptoms related to nutritional deficiency, like anemia and weight loss. Signs of gluten intolerance may be different in children, who are more susceptible to malnourishment that can lead to a failure to thrive. [Celiac symptoms](https://celiac.org/about-celiac-disease/symptoms-of-celiac-disease/) include: [Fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Weight loss - Diarrhea, stools, foul-smelling, fatty, greasy stool - Abdominal bloating, bloated stomach, gas, stomach pain, abdominal pain - Nausea, vomiting - Constipation - Headache, headaches, [migraines, migraine headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) - Skin rash, mouth ulcers, mouth sores, canker sores [Neuropathy, numbness or tingling in hands and feet](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-neuropathy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), problems with balance, joint pain - Cognitive problems, foggy head, [difficulty concentrating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Celiac can lead to [anemia, iron deficiency](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anemia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), loss of bone density (osteoporosis), weak bones, soft bones, bone loss (osteopenia), [joint pain, or arthritis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-arthritis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). People can also have liver problems, including fatty liver. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a specific type of skin rash that causes itching and blisters to appear, primarily on the knees, elbows, torso, top of the head, and buttocks. Women may find that celiac disease affects their [hormones, menstrual periods](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and can have an impact on [fertility](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-infertility-in-women-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), even causing recurrent [miscarriages](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-prevent-miscarriage-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Celiac disease can also contribute to [infertility and low sperm count in men](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-oligospermia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). When a child develops celiac disease, the inability to absorb nutrients from food can cause problems with normal growth, such as short stature, delayed puberty, and damage to tooth enamel. Developmental disorders and behavioral issues can also be related to celiac, like [ADD/ADHD](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and irritability. In extreme cases, Celiac can cause [seizures](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-seizures-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Celiac Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Going through the process of being diagnosed with Celiac disease or gluten intolerance is quite complicated and involves multiple tests. From the medical standpoint, it is best that you do not eliminate gluten or change your diet before the testing, so that it can accurately show how gluten is affecting your immune system and your intestines. First, you will probably have a blood test that looks for certain antibodies that would indicate an autoimmune reaction to gluten. Some people may test negative for antibodies, and yet still have Celiac, though, so this blood testing is not enough to be conclusive. Genetic testing may be done, which looks for specific antigens to rule out Celiac. If testing shows that a person has antibodies, and they also have a specific type of skin rash (dermatitis herpetiformis), that is usually enough for a doctor to give an official diagnosis of Celiac disease. Endoscopy is an imaging test which uses a little camera to see if there is damage to the intestinal lining. They will also take some tissue samples from the lining of the intestine to check for inflammation and damage. The results of these tests may lead to a formal Celiac diagnosis. People will often need to have an endoscopy to find out if they have Celiac disease, and then possibly repeated endoscopies to see if the inflammation is getting better or worse. Sometimes people will try figuring out what is going on themselves with a food sensitivity test or food intolerance test kit that you can do [at home](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-sensitivity-test#our-picks) and send in for results. Food allergy testing may give you some information as to whether you have a reaction to a specific allergen (egg allergy, milk allergy, peanut allergy, shellfish allergy) or have a food sensitivity, but they cannot tell you if you really have Celiac disease or gut inflammation. Going through the diagnostic process for autoimmune diseases like Celiac disease can be exhausting in and of itself. Meanwhile, you aren't yet getting [treatment](https://celiac.org/about-celiac-disease/treatment-and-follow-up/) for your symptoms. The only treatment available in conventional medicine for Celiac disease really is to follow a gluten free diet. Most doctors are not able to do much beyond give you a list of foods you shouldn't eat, or refer you to a dietitian. TCM has the ability to provide more comprehensive [care for people with Celiac disease](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Information/Detail/Can+Acupuncture+Help+Patients+with+Celiac+Disease+), and many other autoimmune conditions. Acupuncturists are highly trained professionals when it comes to offering patients detailed guidance for following an effective Celiac disease diet. Can Acupuncture Help Celiac Disease and Gluten Intolerance? TCM has more to offer than just acupuncture treatment and herbal medicine. Nutrition is one of core competencies every TCM practitioner must master. Acupuncture treatment can help relieve digestive symptoms like abdominal pain and bloating, and also have a positive impact on the system malfunctioning that leads to autoimmune reactions. With Chinese herbs, we are able to get very potent nutrients into the body that wouldn't normally come from food. For people with Celiac, or other problems like food allergies or sensitivities, malnutrition due to malabsorption is a real problem. A [TCM nutrition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3315874/) approach can help restore the body's health with foods and herbs better than a simple elimination diet for Celiac disease can. An acupuncturist listens carefully to the particular symptoms and sensations you describe. These provide important clues as to which organ systems are involved, and where yin and yang are out of balance. Then TCM provides a framework for tailoring the treatment and food plan for Celiac disease to each individual's needs. According to TCM theory, the stomach and spleen are responsible for digesting food. Celiac disease symptoms are, according to a typical TCM diagnosis, related to a spleen deficiency. When Qi in the spleen is weak, the body is not getting the nutrients it needs. Building up the strength of the spleen will often be the focus of the acupuncture portion of the treatment. Herbs and specific nourishing foods will be recommended, which will help anemia and soothe the digestive tract. Acupuncture Near Me For Celiac Disease, West Los Angeles Autoimmune diseases like Celiac disease can be especially frustrating because they seem to take over your whole life. Not only physical health, but mental health is compromised. Treatment options are limited. Fortunately, TCM offers a complementary form of medicine that is able to provide multi-faceted care for autoimmune disorders like can help reduce feelings of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) and [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) as you learn to manage your illness. If you or someone you know has been suffering from digestive issues, and you suspect it may have something to do with gluten intolerance or Celiac disease, be prepared to go through testing, but also give some thought to adding a TCM provider to your health care team. At Art of Wellness, we have over 35 years of providing excellent care through TCM treatments, including expert nutrition services. It is like getting an acupuncturist and dietitian in one. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Meniere's Disease With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menieres-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Ph.D. & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. My ear feels clogged sometimes, I get sudden dizzy spells, and sometimes I think I'm losing hearing in one ear! These symptoms could be signs of [Meniere's disease](https://www.healthyhearing.com/help/tinnitus/menieres-disease), a condition of the inner ear that causes [ringing in the ears](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/) or buzzing sounds, sudden hearing loss, and vertigo-that spinning sensation sometimes accompanied by nausea. Acupuncture is an effective vertigo treatment and can help resolve the [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and hearing problems associated with [Meniere's](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/menieres-disease). A lot of people may not realize that they have Meniere's disease, because the most [common symptoms](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menieres-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374910) can also be indicators of many other health issues. For example, sudden attacks of vertigo can be caused by a condition called [benign paroxysmal postural vertigo, or BPPV](https://vestibular.org/article/diagnosis-treatment/types-of-vestibular-disorders/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo-bppv/). BPPV is another kind of inner ear problem, caused by the movement of small crystals of calcium carbonate into a part of the ear canal where they do not belong. [Vestibular migraine](https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/vestibular-migraine/) and other types of migraine headaches can cause feelings of vertigo and ringing in the ears. Ringing in the ears, also known as [tinnitus](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/tinnitus#2), can also be a symptom of a sinus or ear infection, thyroid problems, cardiovascular problems, or caused by repeated exposure to excessive noise levels. Meniere's disease is a chronic condition that can begin at any time during life, but it is most commonly diagnosed when a person is in their 40s or 50s. Most of the time, Meniere's symptoms only affect one ear. A [\"Meniere's attack\"](https://www.american-hearing.org/disease/menieres-disease/) can come on in a way that is similar to a migraine. First there may be subtle signs that it is starting, like changes in hearing, or a feeling of fullness or congestion in one ear. Then, a sudden and strong attack of vertigo can make you feel so dizzy, light-headed, and off balance that you have to lie down. You may even feel nauseated to the point of vomiting. These episodes of intense dizziness can last anywhere from several minutes to several hours, or even a whole day. Afterwards, you may feel exhausted and need to rest. Never knowing when you might have one of these attacks of severe vertigo can be very disruptive and unsettling, really having a negative impact on your life. Each person's experience of Meniere's disease is different, and there is no clear cause for the disorder. Over time, some people may have fewer and fewer symptomatic episodes, while other people may have them more frequently and may begin to develop more serious hearing problems. Hearing loss associated with Meniere's disease may seem to come and go at first, but it can progress to the point of permanent hearing loss, or deafness. [What causes Meniere's disease?](https://www.enthealth.org/conditions/menieres-disease/) Medical science is unclear as to why some people develop this inner ear problem, but it is generally believed to be related to excess fluid in the ear. Meniere's symptoms might develop after some type of head injury or ear infection, respiratory infection, or viral infection. Meniere's may be related in some cases to [migraine headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), or to immune system dysfunction. Some women experience Meniere's symptoms during their [premenstrual syndrome (PMS)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) week. As with many other illnesses, Meniere's can be triggered by [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) or [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/). Currently, Meniere's treatment typically involves medications that offer some symptomatic relief, like anti-nausea medications. Acupuncture and other TCM treatments for Meniere's disease offer a holistic way to address the varying symptoms of dizziness, vertigo, nausea, tinnitus, and hearing loss. While there is no cure for Meniere's, it is possible to reduce the symptoms so that they are not so bothersome anymore and even to help prevent further hear loss. Top 5 Symptoms of Meniere's Disease Meniere's symptoms can be subtle at first, and a person may only have a few episodes of ringing in ear or vertigo once in a while. The common signs of Meniere's include: - Dizziness, vertigo, spinning sensation, light-headed - Hearing loss, hearing problems, sudden drop in hearing, sounds are muffled - Tinnitus, ringing in the ears, buzzing sound, roaring in ear - Sensation of fullness in the ear, ear feels plugged up or congested - Nausea, feeling like you're going to be sick or vomit In some cases, people with Meniere's can have sudden falls, sometimes called \"drop attacks,\" or [Tumarkin's otolithic crisis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16425641/). You may feel like you're falling, or the room is tilting around you, and the next thing you know, you're on the floor. These falls are unpredictable and can cause injuries. Medical Treatment for Meniere's Disease One of the common [treatments for Meniere's](https://www.cochrane.org/CD003599/ENT_diuretics-for-the-treatment-of-menieres-disease-or-syndrome) vertigo, ringing in the ears, or a sensation of fullness in the ears is the use of [ diuretics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21864986/) like Lasix, Diamox, or Dyazide, following the logic that they will help reduce the amount of fluid in the inner ear. However, there is not much scientific evidence showing that this method works for everyone, and diuretics may have other negative consequences, such as lowering blood pressure. Anti-nausea medications, known as antiemetics, may offer some relief from nausea during bouts of vertigo. Histamines and their receptors are understood to be involved with signalling in the brain that may impact balance, so [antihistamines](https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bcp.14046), such as Dramamine and Benadryl, are often offered as a [ way to reduce dizziness.](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-conditions/ear-nose-and-throat/menieres-disease/treatments.html) Again, there is not much evidence of the efficacy of antihistamines for vertigo. Drowsiness is a common side effect of taking antihistamines. Antidepressants are also sometimes prescribed to help with vertigo. In rare instances, doctors may perform surgery to physically alter the inner ear; this is called labyrinthectomy. This may help reduce debilitating vertigo for some patients or help to prevent drop attacks, but for some people, it can cause even more damage to their hearing capabilities, and can even cause deafness. All of these medical treatments only try to reduce symptoms, they don't help to prevent hearing loss due to Meniere's disease. Can Acupuncture Help Meniere's Disease? According to [TCM theory](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Information/Detail/Acupuncture+Treats+Vertigo+and+Meniere%27s+Disease), the sensation that the ear is clogged is related to a buildup of Phlegm, causing both physical obstruction and blocking the flow of Qi (energy). Dampness and Wind are other pathogenic factors that can contribute to Meniere's symptoms of dizziness, vertigo, and the ringing or whooshing sounds in the ear. Weak Kidney energy, combined with Wind rising from the Liver, can cause dizziness, tinnitus, and headaches. An acupuncturist will listen carefully to find out which symptoms are arising, and when, and will choose [acupuncture points on the head](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/) to directly address the obstruction in the ear, as well as other points on the body to address issues with Kidney Qi. It may be helpful to make certain dietary changes to help address the excess fluid involved in Meniere's disease, including reducing salt and sodium, and limiting caffeine and alcohol. Your acupuncture provider will discuss nutritional choices that will help to relieve Meniere's symptoms. One [study](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0192415X83000173) of Meniere's patients treated with acupuncture showed not only that their vertigo had subsided after a few treatments, but that their hearing levels were maintained rather than worsening as treatment went on. Another [study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1917-acupuncture-meniere-s-disease-recovery) compared patients with Meniere's who were treated with antihistamines to a group of patients who received acupuncture treatment for 12 weeks in addition to the antihistamine medication. The patients who received acupuncture reported significantly less vertigo and dizziness, less tinnitus, and actual improvements in their hearing over the patients who received medicine only. A [review](https://juniperpublishers.com/jcmah/pdf/JCMAH.MS.ID.555715.pdf) of studies using TCM methods, including acupuncture treatment, moxibustion, cupping, and herbal supplementation, to treat Meniere's disease found that symptoms of vertigo and dizziness were, by and large, greatly reduced, to the point of patients reporting their vertigo as being fully resolved. A [study](https://www.nccaom.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Acupuncture%20and%20Herbs%20Eliminate%20Meniere's%20Disease.pdf) in which patients were given acupuncture and herbs for 10 days resulted in a 95% effective rate, with the majority of people treated reporting no symptoms at all after the treatment, even after a two-year follow-up. Acupuncture Near Me for Meniere's Disease in West Los Angeles Vertigo is a deeply unpleasant sensation, and never knowing when an attack of dizziness and nausea may strike can really disrupt your daily life. TCM has a proven track record of effectively helping people get over symptoms like dizzy spells and ringing in the ears, and may even help to prevent further hearing loss. If you know you have Meniere's disease, or if you have some combination of these symptoms but aren't sure what's going on, it may be a good time to visit a qualified acupuncturist to see if acupuncture can help relieve dizziness due to Meniere's, migraines, or BPPV. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Seizures With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-seizures-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Sudden loss of consciousness, convulsions or jerking body parts, staring, feelings of fear, anxiety, deja vu? These are all possible [signs of seizure](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093). Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that causes different types of seizures. Research has shown that acupuncture and TCM treatment for epileptic seizures can be an effective adjunct to conventional treatment. Epilepsy is a common disease of the central nervous system that can happen to people of all ages. Epilepsy is a term that can refer to a variety of different types of seizures; it defines a condition in which a person has recurrent seizures. Over 3 million people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with epilepsy; it is one of the [most common](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/epilepsy) neurological disorders worldwide. What is the cause of seizures? Unusual electrical activity in brain cells [can cause various types of seizures](https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/about-epilepsy-basics/what-causes-epilepsy-and-seizures), depending on what area of the brain is affected. In some cases, people begin to have seizures due to a head injury, or a brain infection, such as [meningitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-meningitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Some people seem to be born with an unusual brain structure that affects the area of the brain that causes seizures. In older people, symptoms of epilepsy may coexist with those of other neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, or seizures may start occurring as an effect of having suffered a [stroke](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-stroke-recovery-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) or [heart attack](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Seizures can be caused by an allergic reaction to some food, as when a person with [Celiac disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-celiac-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) is exposed to gluten. Medical science has not yet discovered the exact meaning of seizures that occur in other cases, but it is thought to be due to genetics. People with epilepsy need treatment to try to prevent or reduce seizures. While some seizures are mild, others can be severe, and even life-threatening. TCM has been using acupuncture treatment and herbs to help seizures for many, many years, and recent research is beginning to [demonstrate how TCM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292226/) as integrative care for epilepsy can be beneficial. What Happens During a Seizure? The signs of seizure [can vary widely](https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/about-epilepsy-basics/facts-about-seizures-and-epilepsy) from person to person, but an individual's specific pattern of what seizures look like will usually remain consistent. Symptoms of seizure include: - A range of changes in awareness: from staring and being unresponsive, up to totally losing consciousness - Stiffening of the limbs, limbs twitching, or part of the [body shaking](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-essential-tremor-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Changes in vision: double vision, seeing flashes of light, staring, or blinking repeatedly [Dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), sudden [headache](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Sweating, nausea - Having trouble breathing, or stop breathing - Falling down for no apparent reason, sudden collapse, head nodding, muscles go limp, sometimes called \" [drop attacks\"](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menieres-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Loss of bladder or bowel control - Feelings of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), [panic attack](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), fear - Sense of having an \"out of body\" experience - Strange taste in mouth or smelling strange smells - Feelings of confusion - Drooling or frothing at the mouth, biting tongue or inside of cheeks - After the seizure, a person may feel exhausted, or have [amnesia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), trouble remembering what happened. Historically, there have been many misconceptions about people who suffer from seizures, or \"fits disease.\" When a person is not having a seizure, they are usually otherwise healthy and capable. People with epilepsy are not necessarily limited in what they can do physically or mentally-except when they are having a seizure-,unless they have other chronic health problems in addition to epilepsy. If you see someone having a seizure, DO stay near them and make sure they are safe. If they fall or seem to be unconscious, turn them onto their side and make sure they are breathing. DO NOT try to physically restrain a person who is having a seizure or attempt to put anything in their mouth. The idea that a person might swallow their tongue while having a seizure is a myth. Top 10 Types of Seizures There are many types of seizures. Sometimes a person has one one seizure caused by medication, drug withdrawal, illness, or some sort of trauma to the brain. A person may have a seizure due to an [allergic reaction](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-allergy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) to some kind of medication or food. Experiencing one seizure does not mean a person is epileptic. Epilepsy is only diagnosed if a person has multiple seizures over time. Seizures are divided into two main categories: focal onset or generalized onset. \"Focal\" refers to a seizure that originates from a localized part of one of the hemispheres of the brain. \"Generalized\" means that there is seizure-causing activity happening all over, or on both sides of the brain. Specific types of seizure include: - Focal Seizure with Retained Awareness - Or, \"focal onset aware seizure.\" Used to be known as a \"simple partial seizure\" or \"partial seizures.\" These are usually short in duration (less than 2 minutes) and a person remains conscious and aware while it is happening, although they may not be able to respond to people around them, or they seem \"frozen.\" The specific feelings vary widely: a sense of deja vu, sense of pressure or anxiety, a strange, overpowering smell, etc. - Focal Onset Impaired Awareness seizure - also used to be called \"complex partial seizures,\" \"temporal lobe seizures,\" or \"psychomotor seizures.\" In this type of seizure, the person loses awareness of their surroundings. They may seem to be staring, zoning out, picking at their clothing, wandering aimlessly, smacking their lips, or making grunting sounds. These, too, are short in duration, and afterwards, the person may feel confused and very sleepy. - Febrile seizures - these are seizures that are caused by having a fever over 100 degrees, usually as a result of having some type of infection, like a flu. [Febrile seizure](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/febrile-seizure/symptoms-causes/syc-20372522)happens in young children; they may have shaking all over or jerking limbs, convulsions, or lose consciousness. Occasionally children may have febrile seizures in response to having a fever after receiving a vaccination. Febrile seizures do not cause brain damage or indicate a neurological disorder; they do not mean a person has epilepsy. - Absence Seizure - used to be called \"petit mal seizure.\" This is a type of generalized onset seizure in which a person briefly loses awareness, or \"blanks out\" for just a matter of seconds. They are caused by abnormal brain activity, possibly related to hyperventilation. [Absence seizures](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/epilepsy/absence-seizures)are more common in children, who may outgrow this disorder. - Myoclonic Seizure - this is a very short kind of seizure that causes muscles to jerk or twitch for just a few seconds. \"Myo\" means muscle, and \"clonus\" means contraction and relaxation. These can happen to people with epilepsy, but [myoclonic seizures](https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-seizures/myoclonic-seizures)can also happen to anyone. That feeling of being jerked awake and having a spasm in your legs when you are falling asleep is a kind of myoclonus. - Tonic Clonic Seizure - this used to be known as \"grand mal seizure.\" This is the type of seizure that causes convulsions, stiff arms and legs, shaking all over, and other symptoms such as losing bladder control, crying out or making strange sounds, losing consciousness, and falling to the ground. A person who has experienced [tonic clonic seizures](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/epilepsy/tonic-clonic-grand-mal-seizures)before may notice an \"aura\" before the more severe symptoms of seizure begin; this might include a sense of vertigo, dizziness, nausea, feelings of anxiety, or strange smells or a weird taste in the mouth. Tonic clonic seizures may last a few minutes, and the person may be exhausted and emotional afterwards. - Refractory Seizures or Uncontrolled Seizures - also called \"drug-resistant\" or \"intractable\" seizures, this is when a person has frequent and/or severe seizures that do not respond to medical therapy such as anti-epileptic medications. - Lennox Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) - LGS is a rare form of epilepsy that shows up very early in life, usually when a child is still in infancy. [Lennox Gastaut](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/lennox-gastaut-syndrome/)causes various kinds of seizures, both tonic (muscle spasms) and atonic (staring, still), or absence seizures. Children with LGS may experience multiple seizures per day, and have [learning delays](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)due to cognitive dysfunction.The cause of LGS is sometimes unknown, but it can be due to abnormal brain development, or a baby having some type of infection or loss of oxygen in utero, before they're born. - West Syndrome - also called \"infantile spasms,\" this is a type of epilepsy in young children that causes spasms and unusual movements for a baby, like throwing out of the arms, straightening the arms out to the sides, knees pulled up to the chest, the upper body bending forward, or head thrown back. [West syndrome](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/w/west-syndrome.html)seizures only last a few seconds, and they usually go away by the time a child is past toddler years. - Status epilepticus - This is a neurological emergency condition in which abnormal brain activity causes a prolonged seizure that lasts longer than five minutes, or multiple seizures that occur back-to-back without recovery in between. This can happen to a person who has epilepsy, or it can happen due to trauma, such as a head injury, or a hypertensive ( [high blood pressure)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/)situation, or a severe reaction to drug toxicity, or an autoimmune disease response. There could be motor symptoms of shaking and collapsing, or the person could just be staring and unresponsive, depending on where the disordered activity is happening in the brain. Status epilepticus is a true medical emergency, and a person needs immediate attention to prevent brain damage. Medical Treatment for Epileptic Seizures Conventional treatment for seizures usually involves medications known as anticonvulsants (anticonvulsive), or anti-seizure [medications](https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/medications-treat-seizures). First, it is necessary for doctors to accurately diagnose the problem: what type of seizures is a person having, and what is causing them? Some drugs help to stop seizures from happening in the short term. Tranquilizers like Valium (Diazepam), Ativan (Lorazepam), and Klonopin may help to stop a seizure while it is happening, but people build up a tolerance quickly to these medications and then have to take higher doses to get the same effect. Other medications, like Aptiom, are taken daily to prevent seizures. There are many other medications used to treat different types of epilepsy, but these medications only work to control seizures in some cases. Other people may struggle to find a medication they can tolerate. Anticonvulsants and other anti-epileptic drugs can cause side effects like weakness, dizziness, headaches, nausea or vomiting, and skin rash. People who experience seizures do need treatment to control epileptic symptoms, but it can be challenging to find the right combination of therapies.
