EMERGENCY PHONE NUMBERS 10 FIRE - POLICE - MEDICAL: 911 (If using a cell phone on the Uptown and Downtown campuses , dial 442-3131 for the University Police Department) IN CASE OF FIRE: Pull alarm box at nearest exit. Evacuate building. If no alarm box, dial 911 EAST CAMPUS - Dial 9 - 911, in th e event of an emergency. East Greenbush Police will respond. Emergency Blue Light Phones can also be used to call the police. - Just pick up the receiver and the police will respond. Most elevators have an Emergency Call Button that links directly in to UPD on the Uptown and Downtown campuses. All laboratories must have an emergency contact sign posted outside the lab. The information on the sign is used to contact the appropriate lab personnel in the event of an emergency in that lab. It also informs emer gency responders of the hazards to be found in that particular lab. For a fillable .pdf form for a lab sign, go to http://www.albany.edu/ehs/pdf/ Laboratory%20Entrance%20Sign.pdf B. MEDICAL EMERGENCY PROCEDURES IN CASE OF MEDICAL EMERGENCY: 11 1. Protect yourself with the appropr iate Personal Protective Equipment, if available (e.g., gloves, safety glasses.) Then give immediate First aid or CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation). See below. 2. Call 911 from an on-campus phone or 442-3131 from a cell phone to reach the University Police Department. If indicated, an ambulance will be summoned. If on the East Campus, dial 9-911 for the East Greenbush Police. 3. Speak slowly and clearly. 4. Give the nature of the emergency. 5. Give the location of the emergency. 6. Give the number and condition of victims. 7. Give the phone number you are using and your name. 8. Hang up last, after the dispatcher does. IN CASE OF CHEMICAL POISONING/EXPOSURE: 1. Follow the same procedures as for Medical Emergency above. 2. Take MSDS* with victim. FIRST AID The emergency phone number for the Uptown and Downtown campuses is: 911 for FIRE - POLICE - MEDICAL 9-911 for East Campus (Dial 442-3131 for University Police Department, if using a cell phone on the Uptown or Downtown campuses) *Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) MEDICAL EMERGENCY PROCEDURES (Cont'd.) GENERAL FIRST AID INSTRUCTIONS 12 In the event of an injury or other emergency, it is important to summon professional assistance immediately. The following instructions are intended only as guidelines for untra ined people in providing assistance to the victim during the fi rst few minutes, until professional assi stance arrives. It is preferable to have a person trained in Firs t Aid, Cardiopulmonary Resuscitati on (CPR) and Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) providing assi stance during the first few minut es. The Office of Environmental Health and Safety urges each department to consider having several people trai ned in First Aid, CPR and AEDs . Contact Employees Benefits Office at 437-4700 for First Aid, CP R and AED training. 1. Effect rescue only if it can be safely done and it is necessary to preven t victim from furt her injury while summoning an ambulance. Otherwise, do not move the vi ctim or allow him/her to move until the injuries have been assessed. Prot ect yourself with the appropriate pe rsonal protective equipment, if available (e.g., gloves, safety glasses.) 2. Ensure an adequate airway. 3. Ensure adequate breathing (giv e mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to- nose respiration, if necessary). 4. Check for circulation by feeling for a pulse at the neck or wrist, if absent begin CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation), if you are trained to do so. 5. Control severe bleeding by the use of direct pressure. THERMAL BURNS 1. Submerge the burned area in cold water (excep t for third-degree burns). This will significantly reduce both swelling and pain. A third-degree burn is one in which tissue damage has occurred. 2. Apply a dry sterile dressing. 3. Do not break any blisters. 4. Do not use any commercial sprays or home remedies (butter, etc.). 5. Seek medical attention (Univers ity Health Center or Hospital.) CYROGENIC BURNS If exposed to liquid or cold gas, restore tissue to normal body temperature 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C) as rapidly as possible, followed by protection of the injured tissue from further damage and infection. Remove or loosen clothing that may constrict blood circulation to the frozen area. Seek medical attention. Rapid warming of the affected part is best achieved by using water at 108\u00b0F/42\u00b0C). Under no circumstances should the water be over 112\u00b0F/44\u00b0C, nor should the frozen part be rubbed either before or after rewarming. The patient should neither smoke, nor drink alcohol. 13 MEDICAL EMERGENCY PROCEDURES (Cont'd.) Most liquid nitrogen burns are really bad cases of frostbite. We don't mean to belittle the harm that can come from frostbite, but at the same time, we wanted to keep the dang ers associated with liquid nitrogen burns in perspective. Indeed, liquid nitrogen burns could be treated as frostbite. CHEMICALS IN THE EYE 1. Flush the eye with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes being careful not to wash the chemical into the other eye. Use an eyewash fountain if one is available. Another person should assist the victim by holding open the victim's eye while it is being flushed. 2. Seek medical attention and have the chemical's MSDS accompany the victim. CHEMICAL BURNS 1. Brush any chemicals off the skin with a clean clot h, gloved hand, etc. Flush the affected area with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. If necessary, cut off or use tweezers to remove chemically soaked clothing; avoid touching contaminated areas of clothing. Continue to flush skin for several minutes more after clothing has been removed. 2. Apply a sterile dressing. 3. Seek medical attention and have the chemical's MSDS accompany the victim. 4. All chemically contaminated clothing must be thoroughly washed prior to re-wearing. *Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) NOTE In the event of an accident or injury, always notify the principal investigator , instructor, supervisor or other person in charge as soon as possible. In all cases of pers onal injury/accident, a \"Supervisor's Report of for faculty/staff) a or Public Injur y\" (Form LP-5 for student/visitor) must be fi lled out. The employee accident form is available on-line at http://hr.albany.edu/content/empacc.doc These forms are also avai lable in the Department Chair's Office or in the EH&S Office in Chem. B73. Also, all lab accidents or near misses must be doc umented on a Laboratory Incident/Accident & Near Miss Report Form. http://www.albany.edu/ehs/pdf/LABORATOR Y%20INCIDENT%20NEAR%20MISS%20REPORT.pdf 14 MEDICAL EMERGENCY PROCEDURES (Cont'd.) POISONING BY MOUTH: IF VICTIM IS CONSCIOUS 1. Call for medical assistance 911 or East Campus 9-911. 2. After medical help has been summoned, call the Poison Help Hotline at 1-800-222-1222. 3. Save the label or container of the suspected poison for identification and for possible transportation with the victim to a medical facili ty. Also, take the MSDS to the medi cal facility. If the victim vomits, save the vomited material for analysis. POISONING BY MOUTH: IF VICTIM IS UNCONSCIOUS 1. Maintain an open airway, adequate breathing. Gi ve artificial respiratio n or CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) if indicated. 2. Call for medical assistance 911 or East Campus 9-911. 3. After medical help has been summoned, call the Poison Help Hotline at 1-800-222-1222. 4. DO NOT give liquids to an unconsc ious or convulsing victim. 5. Save the label or container of the suspected po ison for identification and for possible transportation with the victim to a medical facility. Also, take the MSDS to the medical facility. Save all vomited material. NOT E: Instructions on labels for treatment of poisoning may be outdated or incorrect and should only be followed after consulting a physician. *Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) *POISON HELP HOTLINE* 1-800-222-1222 15 C.

If the clothing is heavily contaminated, depending on what was spilled, it ma y have to be disposed of as hazardous waste. *All lab incidents/accidents and near misse s, must be reporte d on a Laboratory Incident/Accident & Near Miss Report form, in addition to a personal injury/accident form. http://www.albany.edu/ehs/pdf/ LABORATORY%20INCIDENT%20NEAR%20 MISS%20REPORT.pdf *Always read a chemical's Material Safe ty Data Sheet (MSDS) before using. The MSDS will review chemical spill first aid procedures. 19 II. FIRE SAFETY A. FIRE PROTECTION 20 One of the more serious problems that can confront an individual in a laboratory is the spectra of a fire. Electrical equipment, open flames, static electricity, burning tobacco, lighted matches and hot surfaces can all cause ignition of flammabl e materials. Flammable liquids, powders of combustible solids, compressed and liquefied gases are always preval ent; and therefore, caution should be exercised whenever an open flame is required for any particular experiment. Fire falls into four main classes: Class A - ordinary solid combustibles, such as paper, wood, textiles, etc. Class B - flammable liquids, such as gasoline, oil, solvents, etc. Class C - A fire where an electr ical current is present, or wher e a shock hazard could be a reality Class D - burning metals, such as sodium, potassium, metal hydrides, etc. Each type of fire requires an ex tinguisher specifically applicable to controlling that particular fire: Class A - water extinguisher or an ABC dry chemical fire extinguisher Class B - carbon dioxide, BC dry chemical or ABC dry chemical fire extinguisher Class C - carbon dioxide, BC dry chemical or ABC dry chemical fire extinguisher Class D - met-1-x fire extingui sher (available on the second a nd third floors of Chemistry) Flammable substances are those that readily catch fire and burn in ai r. A flammable liquid does not itself burn; it is the vapors from the li quid that burn. The rate at which different liquids produce flammable vapors depends on their vapor pressure, which increases with temper ature. The degree of fire hazard depends also on the ability to form combustible or e xplosive mixtures with air, the ease of ignition of these mixtures, and the relative densi ties of the liquid with respect to wa ter and of the gas with respect to air. These properties can usually be found on a ch emical's Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). These concepts can be evaluated and compar ed in terms of a number of properties: Flash Point: The lowest temperature, as determined by standa rd tests, at which a li quid gives off vapor in sufficient concentration to form an ignitable mixt ure with air near the su rface of the liquid within the test vessel. Many common la boratory solvents and chemicals ha ve flash points that are lower than room temperature. FIRE PROTECTION - (Cont'd.) 21 Ignition Temperature: The minimum temperature required to initiate or cause self-sustained co mbustion independent of the heat source. Limits of Flammability: a) Lower Flammable Limit (Lower explosive li mit LEL) is the minimum concentration (percent by volume) of the vapor in air below which a flam e is not propagated when an ignition source is present. Below this concentration, the mixture is too lean to burn. b) Upper Flammable Limit (Upper explosive limit UEL) is the maximum concentration (percent by volume) of the vapor in air above which a flame is not propaga ted when an ignition source is present. Above this concentration, the mixture is too rich to burn. Autoignition: Takes place when a substance reaches its ignition temperature without the application of external heat. Materials susceptible to autoignition incl ude oily rags, dust accumulations, organic materials mixed with strong oxidizing agents (such as nitric acid, chlorates, permanganates, peroxides, and persulfates), alkali metals such as sodium a nd potassium, finely divide d pyrophoric metals, and phosphorus. See Appendix A. The basic precautions for the safe handling of flammable materials include the following: 1. Flammable substances should be handled only in areas free of ignition sources. 2. Flammable substances should never be heated by us ing an open flame. Prefe rred heat sources include steam baths, water baths, oil baths, heating mantles, and hot air baths. 3. Before lighting a flame, remove all flammable substances from the immediate area. Check all containers of flammable materials in the ar ea to ensure that they are tightly closed. 4. When transferring flammable liquids in metal equipm ent, static generated sparks should be avoided by bonding from container to containe r and the use of ground straps. Th e grounding straps must go to an earth ground. Be sure the clamps on all straps are hitt ing metal and not just the paint on the containers. 5. Notify other occupants of the laboratory in advance of lighting a flame. 6. A flame-resistant lab coat should be worn by any individual in a lab using flammable materials. If handling pyrophoric materials in the lab, a flame-resistant lab coat is mandatory. 7. Store flammable materials prop erly. Use a flammable liquid storage cabinet whenever possible. Flammable liquid storage cabinets can be request ed through the Office Environmental Health & Safety. See Section V.A. for guidelines on the proper storage of flammable liquids. 8. When volatile, flammable materi als may be present, use only non-sparking electrical equipment. 9. Ventilation is one of the most effective ways to prevent the formation of flammable mixtures. An exhaust hood should be used whenever appreciable qua ntities of flammable subs tances are transferred from one container to another, allowed to stand in open containers, or ha ndled in any other way. FIRE PROTECTION - (Cont'd.) 22 Compressed or liquefied gases present hazards in the even t of fire because the heat will cause the pressure to increase and may rupture the c ontainer. Leakage or escape of flammable gases can produce an explosive atmosphere in the la boratory. Acetylene, hydrogen, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and carbon monoxide are especially hazardous. When a liquefied gas is used in a closed system, pressure may buildup, so that adequate venting is required. If the liquid is fl ammable (i.e., hydrogen), explosive concentrations may develop. Any, or all, of the th ree problems, flammability, toxicity, and pressure buildup, may come serious. Suspensions of oxidizable particles (such as magnesium powder, zinc dust, or flowers of sulfur) in the air constitute of powerful explosive mixture. Care shoul d be exercised in handling these materials to avoid exposure to ignition sources. See Appendix A. B.

IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE, 24 FOLLOW THESE PROCEDURES 1. Notify laboratory occupants to evacuate. 2. Pull the building alarm box at the nearest exit. Evacuate the building. DO NOT USE ELEVATOR S. Close all doors behind you. 1 If no alarm box, dial 911 or if on the East Campus, dial 9-911 3. Notify the Office of Environmental Health and Sa fety at 2-3495 as soon as possible regarding the nature of the fire and materials involved. 4. If a person's clothing should catch fire, douse the individual with water (use a safety shower or eyewash drench hose, if one is readily available) or have th e individual, cover their face and drop to the floor and roll. If necessary, physically rest rain the person and roll them around the floor to smother the flames. 5. Learn the location and the use of the nearest fire ex tinguisher, types of fire ex tinguishers available and the procedures for exiting during a fire. Look in building corridors for appropriate evacuation routes.2 Only use a fire extinguisher after you have established a safe exit route and you feel you are capable of putting out the fire. PLAY IT SAFE! Know your limitations; do not co mpromise you life in a hazardous situation. 6. Contact the Office of Environmen tal Health and Safety for any pr oblems concerning fire safety related items at 2-3495. REMEMBER THE ACRONYM \"RACE\", IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE: RACE 1. RESCUE - those in imminent danger 2. ACTIVATE - the building's fire alarm system 3. CONTAIN - the fire and smoke by closing fire doors 4. EXTINGUISH - the fire only if the fire is small, contained and you are traine d in fire extinguisher usage *All lab incidents/accidents and near miss es, must be reported on a Laboratory Incident/Accident & Near Miss Report form, in addition to a personal injury/accident form. http://www.albany.edu/ehs/pdf/LABORATORY%20INCIDENT%20NEAR%20MISS%20REPORT.pdf This includes all lab fires. 1 The doors within a building, especially in stairwells and in corridors, are required to meet State Fire Code. Doors in stairwells must never be propped open. Open doors will allow the spread of smoke and fire to the exits, rendering them useless. Doors in corridors are smoke partitions; they sepa rate areas limiting the spread of smoke, fire, or fumes to adjacent areas. This serves two purposes: limiting damage and/or contamination and extending escape time. Do not prop them open. 2 Building corridors and stairwells are fire exits. NO material shall be placed in any exitwa y. This includes furniture, equipment, boxes, etc. D. FIRE EXTINGUISHER USAGE PROCEDURES: 25 1. Pull the alarm box - this will evacuate the building and summon aid. 2. Remember RACE: Rescue - those in imminent danger Activate - the building' s fire alarm system Contain - the fire and smoke by closing fire doors Extinguish - only if the fire is small, containe d and you are trained in fire extinguisher usage 2. Fight a small fire only (rule of thumb-no larger th an a small trash can) and onl y use a fire extinguisher, if you have been trained and feel confident in using one. Always pl ace the fire extinguisher between you and the fire. If the fire gets larg e, get out! Close doors to slow the fire spread. Stay between the fire and an exit. Do not let fire block your escape path in case it goes out of control. 3. Make sure you use the correct type of fire extingui sher (see page 20). Make sure you do not use one type extinguisher on another type fi re; it may make the fire worse. 4. Learn how to PASS . P ULL Pull the pin. Some units require the releasing of a lock latch, pressing a puncture lever, or other motion. A IM Aim the extinguisher nozzle (horn or hose) at the base of the fire. S QUEEZE Squeeze or press the handle. S WEEP Sweep from side to side at the base of the fi re until it goes out. Shut off the extinguisher. Watch for re-flash and reactivate the extinguishe r, if necessary. Foam and water extinguishers require slightly different ac tion. Read the instructions. *All lab incidents/accidents and near miss es, must be reported on a Laboratory Incident/Accident & Near Miss Re port form, in addition to a personal injury/accident form. http://www.albany.edu/ehs/pdf/LABORAT ORY%20INCIDENT%20NEAR%20MISS%20REPOR T.pdf This includes all lab fires. 26 III. SAFETY PROCEDURES FOR LABORATORY OPERATIONS 27 A. GENERAL SAFETY PROCEDURES 1. New York State Education Law Section 409-A requi res the use of eye protection when working in a laboratory. Chemical splash goggles should be worn wherever chemicals are us ed or stored. Contact lenses are prohibited. Particulate ma tter, liquids, vapors, and gases can lodge behind contact lenses and cause considerable eye damage before they can be washed out with water from an eyewash fountain. Visitors must wear eye protection while in laboratories. 2. Adult visitors in laboratories must be accompanied by a faculty or staff member or a graduate student. Children are PROHIBITED in all laboratories. All laboratories must be locked when unattended. Magnetic stirrers must not be used to hold lab doors open. 3. Avoid unnecessary exposure to all chemicals. Wear la b coats or aprons and gl oves to protect clothing and skin. Lab coats are preferable to aprons as they cover your arms. If handling pyrophoric or flammable liquids or solids, flame-resistant lab coats mu st be worn. Outside of the laboratory, except when transporting chemicals and/or hazardous material s, lab coats and gloves serve no purpose, could spread contamination and should be left behind in the laboratory. Shor ts, cut-offs, capri s, halter tops sandals, flip flops, and open toe shoes MAY NOT be worn in the laboratory area. Long hair and dangling jewelry should be contained. 4. Label all containers of chemical s, including waste chemicals. Incl ude your name, the chemicals used, their concentrations and da te prepared on the label of all solutions . Put the opening date and disposal date on all materials that degrade such as peroxides and ethers. Never use any substance from an unlabeled or inadequately labeled container. 5. Use laboratory fume hoods when handling flammabl e, toxic, or noxious agents. Before conducting any work in a fume hood, first check to s ee if the fume hoods is operating.* IF NO AIR MOVEMENT IS EVIDENT, IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THE POWER PLANT AT 2-3444. 6. Eating, drinking, and smoking are PROHIBITED in the laboratory areas. 7. Know the location of the nearest safety shower, ey ewash station, fire extinguisher and spill kits. Keep them clean and unobstructed. 8. Mouth suction must NEVER be used to fill pipettes, start siphons, or for any other purpose. 9. Never perform experimental work in the laborator y alone, or at least wit hout another person within easy call. Make sure that person knows you are working alone and have that person check up on you periodically. No undergraduate labor atory work is to be carried out in the absence of an instructor. Perform only authorized experiments. Unapproved va riations are prohibited. Research people who are responsible for their own experimental programs s hould inform others working in the area of the chemicals being used and the possible hazards involved. All reactions are to be at tended or made fail-safe if left alone or overnight. Reac tions should be labeled with the na me and phone number of the contact person in case of an emergency. *Vaneometers are available through the Office of Environm ental Health and Safety. 28 GENERAL SAFETY PROCEDURES (Cont'd.) 10. Work with materials only when you know their fl ammability, reactivity, corro siveness and toxicity. Before working with any chemical, review the manufact urer's Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) (for additional information contact the O ffice of Environmental Health and Sa fety - Chemistry B73). Read all labels thoroughly. 11. All known poisons and known carcinogens should be ha ndled with extreme care and kept under lock and key. All Department of Homeland Security Chemical s of Interest (COIs) must be kept secure at all times. 12. A women who works in a laboratory while pregnant sh ould be especially careful to avoid contact with chemicals, particularly those that are embryotoxic or teratogenic. If th ere is any possibility that you may be pregnant or considering pre gnancy, it is strongly suggested th at you consult with your physician concerning possible hazards from exposur e to chemicals in the laboratory. 13. Apparatus attached to a ring-stand should be positione d so that the system's center of gravity is over the base and not to one side - the lower the better, but with adequate room for re moving burners or baths. 14. Provide a vent for chemicals that are to be heat ed. Prior to heating a liquid, place boiling stones in vessels (other than test tubes). Use a thermometer in a boiling liquid if there is the possibility of dangerous exothermic decomposition, as in some distil lations. This will provi de warning and may allow time to remove the heat and apply external cooling. 15. Fire polish all glass tubing and ro ds. Use the proper techniques for in serting and removing a glass tube from a stopper. Shortcuts can lead to a severely punctured hand. Protec t hands with gloves, towel, or tubing holder when inserting or removing tubing from stoppers. Lubr icate the tubing with water or glycerine. Keep hand on tubing close to the stoppe r and out of line with the end of the tube. 16. NEVER look down the opening of a ve ssel unless it is empty. 17. Use beaker covers to prevent splattering when h eating liquids on a hot plate. Keep a pair of tongs conveniently at hand - a specific pair of tongs for the dish, crucible, beak er, casserole, or flask being used. 18. NEVER pour ether, petroleum ether, or other flammable, water-immersib le liquids into sinks to be washed down with water. Fires have been cause d in laboratories by va pors returning through the drainage system. It is also illegal to put most chemicals down the drain. See Hazardous Waste Disposal Procedures - Section VII. 29 GENERAL SAFETY PROCEDURES (Cont'd.) 19. Before opening any bottle on which the lid or top is stuck, first make sure there are no additional hazards with opening the bottle such as peroxide forma tion or pressure buildup in the bottle. If there are no additional hazards associated with opening the bottl e, wrap the bottle with a towel and place it in a metal container before cutting the lid. Use the sa me precautions when opening an ampoule, and at the same time, be careful that the liquid in the am poule is cold. NEVER ope n an ampoule containing a flammable liquid by heating the tip with a flame. When opening bottles which may be under pressure (e.g., hydrochloric acid, formic acid or ammonium hydroxide ), cover the bottle with a towel to divert any chemical spray, and open under a fume hood. 20. When transferring chemicals, make certain th e container is compatible with the chemical. 21. Adequate traps must be used in vacuum system s in which mechanical pumps are used, to prevent corrosion of the pump. Do not release the vacuum in any apparatus when the temperature is above 150\u00b0C. The hot vapors may explode. 22. Use only the necessary length of rubber or other flex ible tubing and keep it to the rear of the set-up. The water pressure at the University may occasiona lly vary and in the past has caused several water supply lines to pop off and flood labo ratories, causing various degrees of damage. Thus, all connecting hoses, especially water supply lines, MUST be fastened with either clamps or wires. If the water lines are not secured and a flood occurs, the department and/or principal investigator may be charged for any damages caused by the flood. 23. Do not mix incompatible chemicals. If in doubt, always check the chemical's Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) or a source book before mixing chemi cals. Always add a reagent slowly; never \"dump it in.\" Observe what takes place when the first amo unt is added and wait a few moments before adding more; some reactions take time to start. ALWAYS ADD ACIDS TO WATER CAUTIOUSLY, WHILE STIRRING. NEVER POUR WATER INTO ACID 24. Appropriate eye protection must be worn when work ing with lasers or other optical sources. Contact the Radiation Safety Officer (Chemistry B73) at 2-3495 for additional information. 25. REMEMBER THAT THE PHYSICAL HAZA RDS OF A CHEMICAL ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS KNOWING AS ITS HEALTH HAZARD S. Physical hazard means a chemical for which there is scientifically valid evidence th at it is a combustible liquid, a compressed gas, explosive, flammable, corrosive, an organic peroxide , an oxidizer, pyrophoric, unstable (reactive) or water-reactive. 30 B. HOUSEKEEPING 1. Set up and label separate waste receptacles for pape r and glass. Oily rags and other oil-impregnated materials should be stored in an approved, covered, metal container and dispos ed of by calling the EH&S Office at 2-3495. DO NOT PUT N OXIOUS MATERIALS IN THE TRAS H. Contact the Office of Environmental Health and Safety for proper disposal. 2. Empty chemical containers are to be triple rinses with water, or the appropriate so lvent depending on the chemical, and taken down to the C.A.S. Scientif ic Stores for disposal. Th e custodial staff is not responsible for the disposal of th ese containers. See Section VII.D. 3. Aisles and hallways should not be obstructed. Benches, tables, desks, and fume hoods are work areas, not storage space. Keep work areas clea n. Keep drawers and cabinets closed. Keep all chemicals off the floor. Do not store chemicals overhead. 4. Equipment with moving parts (gea rs, belts, pulleys) MUST be equi pped with protective guards. DO NOT REMOVE Machine Guards. 5. Centrifuge tubes should be in good condition - no ch ips or other flaws. Tubes should be balanced when in use. 6. Oven temperature regulators should be checked peri odically to ensure that they are working reliably. 7. Use undamaged, clean glassware - no chips or other flaws. 8. Dewar flasks should be taped when in use or enclos ed in metal mesh to prot ect personnel from flying glass. In general, if apparatus is likely to shatter, either because of pressure or vacuum, surround it with mesh or cloth to limit the travel of particles and to protect personnel. 9. Do not attempt to catch glassware, if it is drop ped or knocked over. Glass a pparatus should be set well back from the front edge of the work bench to lessen th e risk of injury, if there is an accidental breakage of glass. 10. Sink traps and floor drains should be kept filled with water at all times to prevent escape of sewer gases into the laboratory. Such gase s may be toxic or flammable and ma y be ignited, causing flash fires. A little vegetable oil may be poured down drains that are not used on a regular basis. This will prevent their traps from drying out and odors from escaping. 11. Chemicals should not be poured down the drain or put in the trash. See Hazardous Waste Disposal Procedures - Section VII. 12. Each water supply outlet within the laboratory should be equipped with either a vacuum breaker or a back-flow prevention device. No auxiliary plumbing should be connected to a water distribution line, unless adequate back-flow prevention is provided. 31 HOUSEKEEPING (Cont'd.) 13. Keep all safety showers and eyew ash stations clean and unobstructed. INSPECT AND FLUSH EYEWASH STATIONS WEEKLY and denote da te on the attached inspection tag. If the eyewash is not working properly, contact the S hop Coordinator's Office at 2-3480. If you need an eyewash and/or safety shower in stalled, contact the Office of Envi ronmental Health and Safety in Chemistry B73. 14. A sign should be fastened on the outside of the door of every laboratory and chemical storage area. This sign should contain the names and phone numbers of the people who should be notified in the event of an emergency. These signs are available on-line at http://www.albany.edu/ehs/pdf/L aboratory%20Entrance%20Sign.pdf 15. Appropriate warning signs should be posted near any dangerous equipment, reaction, experiment or condition. See Appendix on Designated Areas. 16. Keep laboratory doors closed at ALL times. Leav ing a laboratory door open interferes with the air flow of the fume hoods, disrupts the building's air ha ndling system and allows various odors to circulate around the building. Laboratory doors must be locked, if the laboratory is unatte nded. Also, keep building fire doors CLOSED at all times. 17. Clean up all spilled chemicals, water, and br oken glassware immediately. Keep floors unobstructed, dry, and free from slippery materials. DO NO T STORE CHEMICALS IN GLASS CONTAINERS ON THE FLOOR. 18. Keep caps and lids of chemical containers closed when not in use as this prevents contamination and vapor escape. 19. Before leaving the laboratory, turn off all services not in use such as water, electricity, gases and vacuums. Bunsen burners should not be left burning when not in use. They should be turned off at the petcocks. Do not depend upon turn ing a gas burner off at its base. 20. Use only the necessary length of rubber or other flex ible tubing and keep it to the rear of the set-up. All connecting hoses, especially wate r supply lines MUST be fastened with either clamps or wire. NOTE: Water pressure may increase at nigh t. 21. The contents of refrigerators in laboratories should be reviewed and in spected at regular intervals with should not exceed six months. Do not store materials in open containers in the refrigerator. Food and chemicals must NOT be stored toge ther in a refrigerator because of the possibility of contamination. Refrigerators/Freezers should be explosion proof if storing fl ammable materials. See Refrigerators- Section V.F. 22. Keep all air vents unobstructed at all times. DO NOT COVER THEM. It wi ll affect the air flow of the fume hoods. 23. DO NOT BLOCK WINDOWS IN DOORS, particularly on laboratory doors, as this poses a potential life threatening hazard in the event of a fire or chemical spill. In the event of an emergency evacuation, personnel checking the build ing for occupants cannot see into the rooms. 32 C. TRANSPORTATION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS Transporting hazardous substances fr om one location to another within the University can be a serious safety and health problem. Individua ls could be unduly exposed through ca relessness or neglect. For these reasons, extra precautions are not only prudent, but necessary. RULES FOR TRANSPORTING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS 1. Unbreakable containers must be used to transport bulk amounts of chemicals. 2. All liquid chemicals in glass cont ainers MUST be transported in bottle carriers. These carriers are available either for loan or purchase from CAS Scientif ic Stores. The Stores will not release any toxic or hazardous chemical unless it is in an unbr eakable carrier or in a bottle carrier. 3. All compressed gas cylinders, including empties, MU ST be secured upright to a cylinder hand truck with the cylinder valve cap in pl ace. This includes cryogenic tanks. 4. Whenever transporting liqui d nitrogen tanks (or any cryogenic that is venting) in elevators, make sure another person is waiting for you when you exit the el evator. This will ensure that you have someone available to summon help should th e elevator break down and/or you are overcome by the over-venting of the gas. If at all possible, no one should ride in an elevator with a venting cryogenic tank. 5. When transporting chemicals and/or compressed gase s for University use in vehicles, on or off-campus, contact the Office of Environmental Health & Safely for the appropriate procedures and paper work. Chemicals and/or compressed gasses should no t be transported in personal vehicles. 6. Do not transport unstable materials, e.g. old peroxide -forming chemicals. Contact EHS at 2-3495 for assistance. 33 D. FUME HOOD PRACTICES Improper fume hood practices often render the hood useless and unsafe. The hoods are only secondary safety devices and must be used in conjunction with good laboratory safety practices. The following information will help the user attain a higher degree of safety: 1. Prior to fume hood usage, become familiar with the location of the nearest exit, emergency shower, eyewash station and fire extinguisher, and be sure the pathways to these locales are unobstructed. 2. Verify that the hood is operating properly before each usage . Use the installed airflow monitor, a vaneometer, or a piece of tissue to check for ai rflow. A reading of 80 - 150 fpm on the monitor or vaneometer indicates good airflow. DO NOT USE THE HOOD IF ADEQUATE AIRFLOW IS NOT INDICATED. Notify the other occupants in the lab of the problem and immediately contact the Power Plant at 2-3444 (24 hours). If you need a vaneometer , contact the Office of E nvironmental Health and Safety in Chemistry B73. 3. DO NOT USE HOODS ON FRIDAY MORNINGS BETWEEN 7:30 am & NOON. Every Friday morning between 7:30 am and noon the Academic HVAC crew inspects the machinery in the air monitors in the Biology, Chemistry including the Ion Implanter, Earth Science, Fine Arts and Physics buildings. (If Friday is a holiday, Monday is th e inspection day.) In order to protect the HVAC maintenance crew while they are in the monitors where the fume hood exhaust fans are located, it is mandated that on Friday mornings the fume hoods not be used until noon. Be sure all chemicals in the hood are in sealed containers. Als o, do not send anything toxic up the va cuum lines that exhaust on the roof during this time frame. 4. Always wear safety goggles, gloves a nd a lab coat when working around the hood. 5. KEEP THE HOOD UNCLUTTERED; THE MO RE CLUTTERED A HOOD, THE MORE AIR FLOW DISTURBANCES POSSIBLE. K eep the hood as clean as possible. 6. Keep experimental apparatus away from the edge of the hood - at least four (4) inches behind the face of the hood, and well away from the back (blocki ng the baffles will disturb the airflow pattern.) 7. Position the sash appropriately to ensure a minimum face velocity of 80 - 100 feet per minute (fpm). Reducing the open face will increase the face velocity plus provide protection to the user. Keep your head outside the hood and keep the sash closed when the hood is not in use. 8. Try not to store chemicals in th e hood - chemicals stored inside th e hood disturb the airflow pattern (especially when blocking baffles), and reduce the av ailable working space. Evaporation of chemical waste up the fume hood is an illegal form of hazardous waste disposal. All hazar dous waste containers in a hood should be kept sealed, unless they are activ ely being used (actually pouring waste into the container.) 9. Do not use perchloric acid in laboratory fume hoods. Perchloric acid must onl y be used in hoods designed especially for it. Perchlor ic acid, especially when heated and volatized, can form shock sensitive metal perchlorates in metal duct work. Contact the Office of Environmental Hea lth and Safety for proper perchloric acid usage procedures. 34 E. DISTILLATION PROCEDURES Performing a distillation is a common procedure in laboratori es. But the fact that it is common, means that people tend to overlook the inherent hazards. In order to keep dist illations safe, the following rules should be followed: 1. Always use either round-bottomed fl asks or kettles of Pyrex supported w ith a tripod or bench jack, with a neck clamp for added security. To prevent an over-violent reaction, place boiling chips or an ebullator in the distillation flask or bottle. 2. Provide a vent in every distilla tion system and check to see that it does not become plugged. Otherwise, an explosion may occur. 3. Before starting a distillation proces s, check all joints and connections to see that they are greased and tight. Secure glass joints with wire or clamps to prevent vapor leakag e. Be certain that the coolant is flowing and that a receiver of adequate capacity is in place. 4. Perform all flammable liquid dist illations, extractions, and washing operations in a fume hood. Use an electric heating mantel or a water or steam bath for heating - never use an open flame or hot plate. Before distilling ethers or acetal, dest roy all peroxides that may be pr esent. See Appendices A and G. 5. When distillations are performe d under reduced pressure, inert ga s should be introduced by an ebullator. On vacuum stills, be certain that the cont ents of the system have cooled below the boiling point before releasing the vacuum. 6. Avoid overheating still bottoms at end of distillat ion. When stopping a distilla tion, first shut off the heat. Turn off the coolant only after a ll vapors disappear from the condenser. 7. Wear the appropriate PPE, when performing distillations. This incl udes a flame-resistant lab coat, chemical splash goggles and the appropr iate chemically resistant gloves. Taken from the M.I.T. Accident Prevention Guide, Vol. 4 35 F. ELECTRICAL SAFETY 1. All electrical connections should be grounded. 2. Electrical equipment service cords should be in good condition. Frayed cords or exposed wires should be repaired by qualified personne l, as soon as they are detected. Control switches and thermostats should also be in good wo rking order. Special attention shou ld be paid to cables from the power supply to the gels in the gel electrophoresis equipment. Thes e cables must be in good condition, otherwise there is potential for electric shock. Check the cables periodically, and replace when they are worn. 3. Avoid overloading circuits. Do not use multiple outle t plugs for additional connections. Approved UL listed power strips should be used in place of extension cords or multiple outlet plugs. 4. Do not handle any electrical conn ections with wet hands or when standing in or near water. The placement of connections should be such that there is no danger or chemical or water spillage on wires or equipment. Do not allow electrical cords to drape down into the troughs between lab benches (as in the Biology building), as they often have water running through them. 5. Do not use electrical equipment, such as mixers or hotplates, around flammable liquids. 6. Do not try to repair equipment yourself. A ll repairs should be done by qualified personnel. 7. Never try to bypass any safety device on a piece of electrical equipment. 8. In case of fire on or near any electrical equipment, pull building fire alarm box and if possible, dial 911. 9. Use only BC or ABC fire exti nguishers for fires on or near any electrical equipment. 10. Temporary electrical connections should be carefully placed - they sh ould not be run across the floor without protective covering nor left hanging overhead. Temporary connections should not take the place of installing permanent connection s. Heavy items should not be placed on top of electrical cords. 11. Do NOT store flammable or volat ile liquids in refrigerators/freez ers that are not labeled by the manufacturer as being explosion proof and for the storage of flammable materials. For electrical assistance, contact the Unive rsity Shop Coordinator's Office at 2-3480. 36 ELECTRICAL SAFETY (Cont'd.) IN THE EVENT OF ELECTRICAL SHOCK: 1. Do not touch victim until victim is out of contact with live current. 2. Unplug or turn off current or circuit breaker , if possible. 3. Immediately call 911 or if on the Ea st Campus, dial 9-911. State that you have a possible electrocution and request the Fire Departme nt and Medical Assistance. 4. Follow Medical Emergency Procedures. 37 G. APPROVALS FOR RESEARCH The principal investigator must obtain prior approval from the Office of Environmental Health and Safety, and when necessary, the Department Chai r, Radiation Safety Committee, Animal Welfare Committee, Human Subjects IRB, Biomedical IRB, Biosafety Committee (IBC), etc., for particular laboratory operations, procedures, or activities that involve the following: 1. BEFORE ANY CHEMICAL THAT IS REGULA TED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY (CHEMICALS OF INTEREST OR COIs), CAN BE PURCHASED OR OTHERWISE BOUGHT ONTO ANY UNIVERSIT Y AT ALBANY CAMPUS, EHS MUST BE NOTIFIED AND GIVE THE APPROPRIATE AP PROVAL. ONCE APPROVAL HAS BEEN GRANTED AND THE CHEMICAL IS ON-SITE, THE P.I IS THEN RESPONSIBLE FOR UPDATING THEIR CHEMICAL I NVENTORY. A COPY OF THIS INVENTORY MUST THEN BE FORWARDED TO EHS IN CHEMISTRY B73; Please go to Appendix L for a modified list of these Chemicals of Interest. 2. A newly introduced hazardous chemical substance of moderate chronic or high acute toxicity or a chemical that is highly reactive; 3. Working with a substance of known high chronic toxicity; 4. Working with the 25 OHSA regulated ch emicals listed in Section VI.A.; 5. Working with radioactive materials. 6. Working with drugs, animals, human subjects, human pathogens, human cell lines, human bodily fluids, etc. 7. Working with any substances on APHIS a nd CDC's Select Agents and Toxins List. These may have to be registered with APHIS/CDC before pu rchase. See link below and Appendix O for the list. http://www.selectagents.gov/resources/List% 20of%20Select%20Agents% 20and%20Toxins%2009-19- 2011.pdf Consultation with the above bodies may be approp riate to ensure that the toxic material can be approved for purchase, effectively contained dur ing the experiments, safety protocols are established and that the waste material can be and is disposed of in a safe and legal manner. See page 6 of this Plan. 38 H. RESPIRATORY PROTECTION Respiratory protective equipment shoul d not be used as a substitute for adequate exhaust ventilation or other engineering control methods. Bu t when it is clearly impractical to remove harmful dusts, fumes, mists, vapors, or gases at their source, or when emergency protection against occasional and brief exposure is needed, people should ha ve respiratory protective equipmen t available and should be trained on how to use it. There are several types of situations for which respiratory prot ection should be used: a) oxygen deficient atmospheres; b) gaseous toxic cont aminant is present; c) particulate toxic contaminant is present; d) both particulate and gaseous toxic contaminants are present; e) nuisance dusts; f) gaseous contaminant is present below toxic levels. There are a variety of respirators av ailable and each has a particular a pplication. For example, a dust mask is not effective where a toxic gas or an oxygen deficient atmosphere is pr esent. Therefore, it is important to understand the hazardous situa tion and to choose suitable resp iratory protective equipment. The University has a Respiratory Prot ection Program managed by the Offi ce of Environmental Health and Safety involving medical exams, training, and the proper selection and fitting of re spirators. If you need a respirator, contact the EH&S Office in Chemistry B 73. Medical approval by a doc tor is required before an employee or student can wear a re spirator, as respirators put a stra in on the respiratory and cardio- vascular system. The EH&S Office as part of the University's Respiratory Protection Program will make arrangements for this medical approval. The types of respirators currently available at the University include the following: Chemical Cartridge Respirators These consist of a half or full facepiece conne cted directly to cartr idge filters. Air contaminated by a toxic gas or vapor is purif ied by the chemicals in the cartridges. The length of time that a chemical cartridge respiratory provides prot ection depends upon the type of cartridge, the concen tration of the gas or vapor, and the activity of the user. The respirator offers resistance to breathing. Particulate Filter Respirators These consist of a half or full facepiece either with particulate filters attached or the respirator itself may be made out of the filt er material. The filter removes toxic particulates but offers resistance to breathing. 39 RESPIRATORY PROTECTION (Cont'd.) Combination Respirators These respirators offer protection against bo th particulate and gaseous contaminants but present breathing resistance. If Departments suspect that a situation exists in their laboratories that require either the emergency or routine use of respiratory protection, they should contact the Offi ce of Environmental Health and Safety for an evaluation of the need for re spirators and the t ype to be used. Departments may request respirators from the Office of Environmental Health and Safety to be used on a short-term or emergency basis. If the need for respir ators is expected to be long-term, Departments should consider purchasing respirators, on the advice and approval of the O ffice of Environmental Health and Safety. In either case, respirators should be availabl e at all times to the people who work in hazardous locations or situations where resp iratory protection is required. Only people who have gone through the University's Respiratory Protection Progr am will be allowed to use them. 40 I. MEDICAL CONSULTATION AND MEDICAL EXAMS Any laboratory personnel who works with hazardous chem icals has the right to receive medical attention, including any follow-up examination which the examining physician determines to be necessary, under the following circumstances: 1. Whenever a lab worker develops signs or sympto ms associated with a hazardous chemical to which they were exposed to in the laboratory. A materi al's MSDS is a good place to start for signs and symptoms of overexposure. 2. When exposure monitoring reveals an exposure level routinely above th e action level or the permissible exposure level (PEL), where no action level exists. See Appendix C. 3. Whenever an event takes place in the work area su ch as a spill, leak, explosion, or other occurrence resulting in the likelihoo d of a hazardous exposure. 4. Whenever an employee is required to wear a respirat or as part of their job dut ies. See H. Respiratory Protection above. 41 J. PROVISIONS FOR EMPLOYEE INFORMATION AND TRAINING INFORMATION The Chemical Hygiene Plan contains all of the information requirements described in Paragraph F of 1910.1450. TRAINING There are various on-going training activities for laboratory personnel: The EHS Office routinely offers EHS Safety Tr aining for lab personnel. It is mandatory training for any individual, including faculty, staff an d students, working in a research lab on campus. The following topics are covered under this trai ning: chemical safety, laboratory safety, hazard communication, biosafety, radiation safety, fire safety, emergency pr ocedures, hazardous and universal waste disposal procedures, plus other related safety topics. If you have a need for customized training or require tr aining on a particular safe ty topic, please contact the Office of Environmental Health and Safety at 2-3495. We will try to accommodate your training request as soon as possible. 42 IV. MATERIAL SAFETY DATA SHEETS 43 A. HOW TO READ AND UNDERSTAND AN MSDS Remember the physical hazards of a chemical ar e just as important as its health hazards. A Material Safety Data Sheet is written by the company that creates a chemical or a company that blends different chemicals into a chemical product. Although the intent is the same for all MSDS, to comply with the regulations and convey hazard information, there are several reas ons why MSDSs may vary widely in appearance. MSDS do not have a standard format. Although the Federal government requires MSDS to contain certain information, the producer of the hazardous material may present this in formation in their own format. The original suggested OHSA format had 10 sections. The new suggested ANSI format has the 15 sections described below. Some of MSDS come from manufacturers in other countries. Although these documents still satisfy U.S. requirements, they may be more directed toward the requirements of another government. The Canadian WHMIS (Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System) is common as well as hazard information based on EEC (European Economic Community) Directives. A Glossary of MSDS Terms is ava ilable on the EHS web site, under Chemical Safety. The United Nations, in cooperation with other international organizations, has created a Global Harmonization System (GHS) of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals. It is designed to replace the various classification and labeling standards used in different countries by using consistent criteria for classification and labeling on a global level, thus creating one universal standard. The GHS should be globally in place by 2015. For more information on GHS go to http://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghs.html Only chemicals that are considered hazar dous by OSHA are required to have a MSDS. Many manufactures will create a MSDS for a non-hazardous chemical but these are being disc ouraged. This concept may also be noted in the components section when only some of the ingredients are iden tified and the remainder just as non-hazardous. The following are the 15 sections recommended by ANSI (formerly the American National Standard Institute). Chemical product and Manufacturer Identification: the name th at should appear on the chem ical's label and a name and address for the manufacturer. Other forms of identification may be noted such as a chemical family, synonyms, formula, or trade name. There might also be a product or catalog number that may be critical in distinguishing between different grades or mixes of the same chemical. Composition: information on ingredients. Only the hazardous ingredients need to be identified, down to 1% for a hazardous chemical and 0.1% for a chem ical considered to cause cancer. Ex posure limits are usually listed here. Physical Data: measurements obtained by standardized tests. Common parameters like color and appearance will help identify the product and bring attention to a chemical that may be decomposing. Boiling point, vapor density, and evaporation rate will indicate how easily the chemical may become and inhalation exposure. Odor then becomes a detection method for this exposure. For specific definitions and advice on each of these parameters, see the MSDS Glossary located on the EHS web site, under Chemical Safety. Some physical hazards may be found here. Fire Fighting Measures: what to use to extinguish this chemi cal should it start to burn and also special hazards when the chemical burns such as the release of toxic smoke. Flash point and flammability limits directly determine the classification for fire hazard. Much of th e information here is direct ed toward First Responders such as the Albany Fire Department. Hazardous Identification and Fi rst Aid Measures: the health hazards for th is specific chemical and what to do if exposed. There may be numerous medical terms used in this section. These will be defined in the MSDS Glossary. Just as important are the conditional words such as \"may cause\" vs. \"will cause\". Also note the route of entry for an exposure. That is, a health affect may be caused if the ch emical is inhaled or swallowed (ingested) but not by skin contact, for example. Also note the target organ mentioned, that is, the part of the body that will experience these adverse 44 health effects and that may seem unconne cted to the route of entry. For exampl e, alcohols, absorbed through the skin may damage the liver and central nervous system. The symptoms of overexposure mentioned in this section are, along with odor, first warning signs that there is a problem. HOW TO READ AN MSDS (Cont'd.) Stability and Reactivity: unstable chemicals will form new chemicals out of themselves and atmospheric ingredients in uninitiated reactions. This unintended reaction might generate a he alth risk such as the release of energy or may lead to the creation of a new chemical with very different potentia l hazards that the original. Conditions to avoid relate specialized storage conditions that should be used to inhibit unstable chemicals. A shelf life, reaction inhibitor, or hazardous decomposition products may be mentio ned. Some physical hazards are found here. Accidental Release Measures: Spill cleanu p materials, techniques, or precautions. Handling and Storage Measures: types of containers, special storage conditions, and chemical incompatibilities. The most common chemical segregation issues are: Segregate reactives from flammables and combustibles. Segregate acids (low pH) from caustics (high pH). Segregate corrosives (both acids and caustics) from flammables. Segregate oxidizers from everything. Exposure Controls/Personal Protection: Recommended engineering controls such as a fume hood as well as the correct eye protection, gloves and other PPE (personal protective equi pment. Pay attention to the specific glove material (rubber vs. nitrile, etc) A glove resistance chart can be found in many supply catalogs or from the link: http://www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/manual/pprotect.htm Toxicological Information: the results of tests on animals or documented case studies for the chemical or for its components. This information is directed at medical or occupational health specialists. Certain thresholds in standardized toxicological tests are used establish warning terms such as \"T oxic\" vs. \"Extremely Toxic\". Specific forms of toxicity are also noted here and may include carcinogenicity (ability to cause cancer) teratogen. Ecological Information: the potential impacts of this chemical once released into the environment. Many chemicals have very different health effects on plants and other animals. Ecotoxicdity data may include information on acute and chronic toxicity to fish and invertebrates, or plants and microorganism toxicity. Characteristics that might be used to assess a spill of this chemical might be noted such as soil mobility, bioaccumulation, or photolytic stability. Disposal Considerations: usually just a general reference to disposal according to local, state, or federal regulations. The University at Albany is mandated by U.S. EPA and NYS DEC to identify, segregate, and properly dispose of any chemicals defined as \"hazardous waste\". Information on ho w to identify, label and store hazardous waste is available from the EHS web page. Transport Information: packaging and labeling requirements based on the US DOT (Department of Transportation) shipping tables. Regulatory Information: notation if this chemical is on a list of chemicals specifically covered by an OSHA or EPA regulation. Even though a chemical may be listed, the regula tion may only be in effect at a certain RQ (Reportable Quantity) or TPQ (Threshold Planning Quantity). Other Information: open to any ad ditional information such as refe rences or MSDS revision dates. For an excellent MSDS database, go to: http://siri.org/msds/ 45 B. TOXIC CHEMICALS A toxic chemical is one that ha s the potential for injuring the hu man body or its systems by direct chemical action. Almost any substance is toxic when taken in excess of \"toler able\" limits. See Appendix C. A person may be exposed to a toxic chemical in a number of different ways. The four PRIMARY ROUTES OF ENTRY are: 1. Absorption - Direct chemical contact with the skin or eyes is the most common type of chemical exposure. The substance can enter the bloodstream th rough the outer layers of the skin, contact with eyes, through hair follicles, or surf ace openings from cuts and bruises. 2. Inhalation - Inhalation of chemicals into th e respiratory passages and lungs. 3. Ingestion - Ingestion of chemicals either directly or indirectly by contamination of hands, food, or drink. 4. Injection - Injection of the chemicals into the body through syringes, puncture wounds, or broken glassware. The effects of the toxic chemical may be local or systemi c, acute or chroni c. Knowing what these terms mean is useful and can usually be found on the chemical's MSDS. Local Toxicity The effect a substance has on the body tissues directly exposed to it. For example, an acid exhibits local toxicity because it can cause burns of the skin, eyes, mouth, or stomach, if it comes in contact with them and can cau se irritation of the respiratory tract. Systemic Toxicity The effect a substance has on body tissues afte r it has been absorbed into the bloodstream. For example, mercury exhibits systemic t oxicity because it effects the brain, kidneys, gums, and teeth after it ha s been inhaled or ingested. Acute Effect Short term exposure. A single dose in which the body's ability to prot ect itself is overcome by the substance. Acute exposures are usuall y reversed over a period of time. Benzene is an example of a substance with an acute toxi c effect, causing irritati on of skin and eyes and narcosis. Chronic Effect Long term exposure. Chronic effect is define d as low level exposure over a long period of time in which the ra te of exposure is greater than th e body's ability to protect itself. Chronic effects often do not appear until years later. Benzene also exhibits chronic t oxicity, producing severe anemia and possibly cancer. 46 * REMEMBER THE PHYSICAL HAZARDS OF A CHEMICAL ARE JUST AS IMPORTANT AS KNOWING THE HEALTH HAZARDS OF A CHEMICAL. Always consult a chemical's MSDS before using that chemical for the first time. C. CATEGORIES OF RELATIVE TOXICITY OF CHEMICALS AND ASSOCIATED SIGNAL WORDS CATEGORIES OF ACUTE TOXICITY Catagories of Relative ToxicitySignal Word on Chemical LD50 b LC50 c mg/literProbable Oral Lethal Dose for 150 lb human Highly Toxic Danger 0 - 50 0 - 200 0 - 200A few drops to a teaspoonful Moderately ToxicWarning 50 - 500 200 - 2000 200 - 2000One teaspoonful to one once Slightly Toxic Caution 500 2000- 20000 - - - One once to one pint or one pound Relatively ToxicNone 5000 20000 - - - Over one pint or one pound a LD50 is the commonly used measure of acute oral and de rmal toxicity. It means the Lethal Dose for 50 percent of the subj ects receiving the dose is expressed in milligrams of substance per kilogram of body wei ght of the subject. b LC50 is the commonly used measure of acute inhalation to xicity. It means the Lethal Concentration of 50 percent of the subj ects receiving the dose and is expressed in milligrams of substa nce per liter of air breathed by the subject. c In addition, the word \" POISO N\" and the skull and crossbones must be displayed with the word \"DANGER !\" for highly toxic chemicals. 47 D. PEL'S AND TLV'S PEL (Permissible Exposure Limit) and TLV (Threshold Limit Value) are standards or guidelines that establish certain levels of a substa nce to which nearly all workers ma y be repeatedly exposed, day after day, without adverse effects. PEL's are legal standa rds, established by OSHA, while TLV's are guidelines recommended by the American Conference of Govern mental Industrial Hygien ists (ACGIH). These exposure limits, expressed in parts per million (ppm) or milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m 3 ), are based on a time weighted average for an 8 hour day/40 hour work week. These limits can be found on a chemical's Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). The important thing to remember about PEL's and TLV's is that the lower the number, the more dangerous th e substance. (For a listing of some PEL's, see Appendix C.) Before using a chemical, the researcher should be familiar with the hazards of the chemical. This information is most readily obtained from the ch emical's label and the manufacturer's MSDS. The chemical label is provided by the manufacturer with: a) information on the type of hazard a chemical presents, whether toxic, flammable, explosive, oxidizing, corrosive, or some other hazard; b) a signal word indicating the relative hazard, DANGER, WARNING, or CAUTION (see previous page); c) instructions on how to use the chemical safely; and d) instructions on emergency measures, such as first aid, fire fighting, and spill clean up. After becoming familiar with the properties of a toxi c chemical, the researcher should plan his or her experiment to include protective clothing and equipmen t, special laboratory prac tices, and procedures for emergencies. The Office of Environmental Health and Safety in Chem istry B73 is available to help researchers evaluate their exposure to toxic chemicals. Good sources of information on toxic chemicals, besides the MSDS, are: Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, edited by N. Irving Sax; Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemi cal Substances, offered by NIOSH; and Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents; by ACGIH. 48 V. SAFE CHEMICAL STORAGE 49 A. CHEMICAL STORAGE GUIDELINES: IN RELATION TO NEW YORK STATE FIRE CODE REQUIREMENTS There is no easy ABC solution to the problems associ ated with the storage of chemicals, including flammable and combustible liquids. The basic approach is to limit the amount of flammable liquids to reduce the risk of accidents, and mo re importantly, to reduce the conseq uences of accidents. Reducing the quantity of flammable solvents to the limits set by fi re codes will enhance overall laboratory safety and minimize the risks of major fires and/or injuries. In essence, the storage of flammable or combustible liquids are to be limited to amounts needed for the day to day operation of the labs. Laboratories were not designed or intended to be long term storage areas for large quantities of solvents. The storage of solven ts for convenience unnecessari ly increases the risk of accidents with severe consequences. 1. Maximum storage of flammable and combustible liquids shall not exceed 120 gallons (45 liters) inside a flammable storage cabinet. 2. The maximum number of flammable storage cabinets w ithin a maintained fire area is three (3). A fire area is defined as a room or rooms separa ted from other rooms and corridors by a fire rated enclosure with opening protectives (doors, vents, slide up doors), which must self-close and latch. The fire area shall not exceed 5000 sq. ft. 3. Flammable and combustible liquids will not be stor ed in/or block egress from any lab or storage area. 4. The maximum amount of flammable liquids stored outside of an approved storage cabinet is 35 gallons/132.5 liters. Of these 35 gallons, 25 gallons/95 lit ers must be in safety cans; the remaining 10 gallons/38 liters may be in other permissible containers. 5. No safety can shall exceed 2 ga llons/8 liters in inst ructional (undergraduat e) labs. 5 gallon/18.9 liter safety cans may be used in any other lab using chemicals. 55 gal. drums of solvent for use in labs are prohibited from being purchased. 6. Solvents with a flash point (see MSDS) of 10 0\u00b0F or less shall not be transferred between metal containers unless the containers are electrically bonded to a ground source. 7. These solvents are commonly stored in laboratories in excessive quantities. This practice must be controlled. 50 nonflammable) Hydrocarbons CHEMICAL STORAGE GUIDELINES (Cont'd.) 8. Incompatible chemicals shall be physically separated to prevent accidental contact. Examples: Acids & Bases Acids & Solvents Organics & Inorganics Water Sensitive Chemicals Oxidizing Agents & Organics Oxidizing Agents & Flammables Organic Acids & Inorganic Acids Oxidizing Agents & Reducing Agents Oxidizing Agents & Dehydrating Agents 9. Containers of materials that may become hazar dous upon prolonged storage should be dated when first opened. At six month intervals, the chemicals shall be evaluated or tested for continued safe use (i.e., peroxides). 10. One way to achieve safe storage of chemicals is to adopt a method suggested by the chemical manufacturers. For example, Fisher Scientific uses color-coding to signify groups of chemicals, which may be stored together. Whether the color code is used or not, the main idea is the separation of incompatible chemicals. Attach ed is a list of commonly used chemicals grouped together as compatibles. It follows that the chemicals within the gr oup shall not be stored with chemicals within another group due to possi ble unfavorable reactions. 11. COMPRESSED OR LIQUIFIED GASES - Only gas cy linders necessary for cu rrent lab requirements shall be in the lab. All Gas cylinders shall be secure ly restrained to prevent falling over, whether empty or full. Also, all gas cylinders must have valve caps in place when not being used, if appropriate. Regulators should be removed and valve caps put back on any gas cylinder not being used again within one week. Cylinder contents, wh ich create a health hazar d (such as neurotoxins, poisons, etc.), shall be stored so that they will not contaminate breathing air. 51 This table shows the maximum allowable size of va rious containers for flammable and combustible liquids. Always consult the MSDS for properties of th e class of liquid being used. Class is based on flash point.

FLAMMABLE LIQUID STORAGE GUIDELINES Part II - Instructional Laboratories Using Chemicals MAXIMUM QUANTITIES OF FLAMMA BLE AND COMBUSTIBLE LIQUIDS IN INSTRUCTIONAL LABORATORIES Storage: Maximum amount of flammable liquids located outside of the flammable liquid storage cabinets is as follows: 35 gallons/132.5 liters of these 35 gallons (132.5 liters), 25 gallons/ 95 liters MUST be in approved safety cans, the remaining 10 gallons/38 liters ma y be in other perm issible containers. Flammable Liquid Storage Cabinets : Maximum number of cabinets is three (3) with 120 gallons/454.2 liters of flammable liquids per cabinet. NO individual storage container may exceed 5 gallons/19 liters. AND N O individual storage container for Class 1A liquids may exceed 2 gallons/8 liters. AND NO SAFETY CAN may ever exceed 2 gall ons/8 liters. All laboratories shal l have a one hour separation from all ot her areas. All doors l eading to the common corridor (hallway) MUST close by themselves (self-closure) and latch. Access to all room exits shall be maintained at all times. Doors are to be kept clear and unlocked from inside the laboratory. All laboratories shall have: 1. Portable Fire Extinguishers, wh ich are immediately accessible; 2. The ability to hear building fire alarms; 3. An emergency evacuation plan formulated by the la boratory staff and practiced at regular intervals. 55 FLAMMABLE LIQUID STORAGE GUIDELINES (Cont'd.) COMPRESSED OR LIQUIFIED GAS CYLINDER STORAGE (NFPA 45 Section 8-2) 1. The total number of cylinders shal l be reduced to three (3 ), 10\" 50\" cylinders or two (2), or ten (10), 2\" x 12\" linders or up to 25, 2\" x 12\" cylinde rs by special exception. (Stated sizes or equivalent volume is permitted.) 2.

ALL cylinders shall be individually secured in place to prevent falling. 4. Oxygen cylinders must be 20' from combustible mate rials when in storage. They shall also be 20\" from fuel gas cylinders separate d by a non-combustible barrier. 5. Caps shall be in place to protect valves while not connected for use. 6. Empty containers will be properly disposed of and shall not be allowed to be stored. 7. All containers will be properly la beled as to their content. If the c ontents are changed, the labels must also be changed. However, this is not recommended since the chance of mixing inter-reactive materials is substantially increased. ____________________________________ NOT E: Above excerpts are from NFPA 45 - \"LABORATORIES USIN G CHEMICALS\" Code and Fire Code, State of New York. OF NOTE, EMPTY GAS CYLINDERS ARE ST ILL CONSIDERED HAZARDOUS AND MUST BE DISPOSED OF PROPERLY. NEVER PUT A GAS CYLINDER IN THE REGULAR TRASH. CONTACT EHS FOR PROPER DI SPOSAL PROCEDURES. 56 B. STORAGE OF CHEMICALS 1. DO NOT OVERSTOCK CHEMICALS. 2. KEEP QUANTITIES OF ALL CHEMIC AL MATERIALS TO A MINIMUM. 3. Purchase ONLY the smallest quantity necessary to co mplete your experiment and/or research project. 4. Storage Conditions - Flammable liquids must be st ored in flammable storage cabinets or explosion- proof refrigerators, if refrigeration storage is neces sary. Eliminate all ignition sources (flame, heat from radiators, etc.) from storage area or locate stor age area away from fire hazards. See Section V.F. 5. Chemicals should be stored with labels facing ou t, in metal cabinets or on secured, level metal shelves (excluding perchloric acid). No storage on the floor or high er than eye/face level is allowe d. Large containers should be stored towards the back and botto m of shelves. Keep chemicals away from shelf and counter top edges. If possible, sh elves where chemicals are being stor ed should have pr otective edges to prevent chemicals from falling off. DO NOT STORE IMCO MPATIBLE CHEMICALS TOGETHE R. See Sections V. C., D., E. 6. Containers of perchloric acid s hould be kept on trays of glass, cer amic, or polyethylene materials of sufficient capacity to hold all of the acid in case containers should leak. Perc hloric acid forms a contact explosive when in contact with meta ls. In general, acids should be st ored on trays (polyethylene) with sufficient capacity to hold a leaking container's contents. Please consul t with EHS before using perchloric acid. 7. Store dichromate cleaning solution s in cool areas, away from other chemicals. Keep the bottle caps slightly loosened. See Appendix C. 8. Fume hoods should not be used as a storage area. Chemicals stored in a fume hood interfere with the hood's proper airflow. 9. Keep caps and lids of chemical containers closed wh en not in use as this prevents contamination and vapor escape. 10. Ethers should be stored in dar k, cool, well-ventilated storage ar eas. Ethers with low flash points should be stored in an e xplosion-proof refrigerator. Be aware of which chemicals form organic peroxides use them up or dispose of them before they become a physical hazard. See Appendix G. 11. DO NOT USE THE FLOOR FO R STORAGE. DO NOT STORE CHEMICALS OVERHEAD. 12. POISONS AND DRUGS MUST ONLY BE STORED IN LOCKED CABINETS. 57 13. Consult a chemical's MSDS for proper storage information. Review the chemical's physical and health hazards for proper storage information. C.

SAFE PROCEDURES FOR GENERAL CATEGORIES OF CHEMICALS A. CARCINOGENS 65 Specific regulations have been established by the O ccupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) regarding the handling of certain compounds designated as carcinogenic . Anyone contemplating work or who are working with materials on this list should consult the Environmental Health & Safety Office in Chemistry B73 for the regulations, necessary approvals, training, work ing conditions, monitoring, record keeping and medical surveillance. The Federal Government has issued very detailed re gulations for the chemicals listed below. Go to OSHA website for more information. http://www.osha.gov/SLTC /carcinogens/index.html Any laboratory personnel who use or handle any of these chemicals should contact the Office of Environmental Health & Safety for detailed information: 2-Acetylaminofluorene Acrylonitrile 4-Aminodiphenyl Asbestos Benzene B e n z i d i n e bis-Chloromethyl Ether 1,3-Butadiene C a d m i u m Chromium (VI) Coke Oven Emissions 1,2-Dibromo-3-Chloropropane 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine (and its' is imperative that th e Material Safety Data Sheet be consulted before using ANY chemical. B. PROCEDURES FOR US ING COMPRESSED GASES 66 Compressed gases are defined by the U.S. Department of Transportati on as any material or mixtures having in the container either an absolute pressure exceeding 40 psi at 2 0\u00b0C (70\u00b0F) or an absolute pressure exceeding 104 psi at 54. 4\u00b0C (13 0\u00b0F), or both; or any liquid fla mmable material having a Reid vapor pressure exceeding 40 psi at 37. 8\u00b0C (10 0\u00b0F). For the purposes of safety, all volatile materials and mixtures packaged in cyli nders should be considered compressed gases. The use of compressed gase s may give rise to the following hazards: 1. Equipment failure and/or leakage may occur, resu lting in the diffusion of gases and contamination of the atmosphere. This contamination can cause toxic or anes thetic effects, asphyxi ation, or explosive concentrations of flammable gases. 2. The flash point of a flammable gas under pressure is always lower than ambient or room temperature; thus, leaking gas can rapidly form an explosive mixture with air. 3. Upon rapid expansion, low-boiling point materials can cause frostbite on c ontact with living tissue. 4. Some compressed gases are corro sive, irritating, or reactive. 5. A compressed gas cylinder without a protective cylinder valve cap may release its contents with great force when dropped. If a cylinder is punctured, it may al so release its contents wi th great force. Cylinders have been propelled th rough walls and roofs. Because of these hazards, precautions need to be ta ken in the handling, storage, and use of compressed gas cylinders. RULES FOR HANDLING COMPRESSED GASES 1. When cylinders are received, they should be inspected to determine if: a. cylinder valve protection caps are in place; b. cylinder and valves are in serv iceable condition and show no corrosion. 2. Always use a cylinder hand truck for transport. If trans porting compressed gases in a vehicle, contact the Office of Environmental Health & Safety for instructions. Personal vehi cles should never be used to transport compressed gases or chemicals to be used at the University of Albany. 3. ALL Cylinders should be individually chained or ot herwise secured in an upright position at all time s. Use cylinders in an upright position only. Securi ng brackets and straps are available for sale in CAS Scientific Stores. 4. Do not drop cylinders, full or empty, or permit them to fall against each other. PROCEDURES FOR USING COMPRESSED GASES (Cont'd.) 5. Leave cylinder valve caps on cyli nders until secured a nd ready for use. 67 6. All valves should be closed when not in use. 7. Regulators must be used to control pressures to operating requirements. Use the proper regulator for the particular gas. Never force a regul ator onto a compressed gas cylinder Only materials recommended for the particular gas service involved shall be used in piping, fittings or equipment. Regulators should be removed from a compressed gas cylinder if the gas will not be used again within a week. 8. Always consider cylinders to be full and handle accordingly. 9. The cylinders of nonliquified gases should be considered empty while positive pressure (25 psig or greater) still remains in order to pr event suck back and contamination. 10. Cylinders containing liqui fied gases should never be completely em ptied in order to prevent suck back and contamination. 11. Oxidizers must not be used in contact with oils, grease or other hydrocarbons. 12. Flammables must not be exposed to flames, sparks or arcs including static elec tricity, hot surfaces or oxidizers. Bond and ground all cylinders and piping containing flammable gases to prevent the hazards caused by the buildup of static electricity. 13. Nonflammables must not be allowed to displace ai r in confined workspaces so that there is not sufficient oxygen for breathing. 14. When corrosive gases are being used, the cylinder valve stem should be worked frequently to prevent freezing. 15. Highly toxic gases or pyrophoric gases require speci al handling. Prior approval must be gotten from the Office of Environmental Health and Safety be fore using these gases. Safe handling protocols including emergency response procedures must be written by the lab, with consultation from the Environmental Health and Safety Office, wh en using these gases. These gases may require the use of vented gas handling cabinets with emerge ncy shutoffs and gas detection monitors with alarms. 16. Contact the Environmental Health and Safety Of fice at 2-3495 for proper disposal instructions for compressed gas cylinders that are no longer wa nted or that are empty. Compressed gas cylinders can not be thrown in the regular trash when empty, as they are still considered a hazardous material and may have to be disposed of as hazardous waste. Every effort should be made to return the empty compressed gas cylinder to the manufacturer, as disposing of compressed gas cylinders as hazardous waste is extremely expensive. This incl udes lecture size gas cylinders and the non-usable gas cylinders. 17. All non-empty aerosol cans are considered hazardous wa ste. If there is still product in the can, even if you can't remove it, the aerosol can't go in the regular trash and must be given to the EHS Office as hazardous waste. Safety devices are available to prevent suck back and relieve sudden pressure increases . PROCEDURES FOR USING COMPRESSED GASES (Cont'd.) 68 STORING COMPRESSED GASES: 1. Store cylinders in a fire-resistant, cool, dry, and adequately ventilated area. Rust will damage cylinders and will often cause the valve caps to stick. Cyli nders should be adequately secured in an upright position (so that they can't fall over) while being stored. 2. The storage area should not co ntain any sources of ignition. 3. Storage area temperature should not exceed 10 0\u00b0F. 4. Floor should be level. 5. Floor should be designed to protect cylinders from dampness. 6. Cylinders should be protected from weather extremes and direct sunlight. 7. Store gases supporting combustion (O 2, C l 2, etc.) at least 25 feet from fu el gases, preferably in another storage area. 8. Highly toxic gases and pyrophoric gases may requi re storage in vented gas handling cabinets along with emergency shutoffs and gas detection monitors and alarms.

PROCEDURES FOR USING COMPRESSED GASES (Cont'd.) 70 OTHER TIPS FOR SAFE HANDLI NG OF COMPRESSED GASES: 1. Oily (not specially cleaned) fittings should never be used with oxygen. Oxygen under pressure will rapidly oxidize oil or grease and result in an explosion. Equipment specifically \"cleaned for oxygen servic e\" must be used. 2. Acetylene can explode if not prope rly regulated. An automatic pressu re regulator is the only type of recommended control. Acetyl ene can explode with extreme violen ce if ignited. It can also form explosive compounds in contac t with copper or brass. 3. Regulators can leak and build pr essure within a closed gas deliver y system. A pressure relief device should be employed. A trap should be inserted in outlet lines to prev ent liquid from flowing back into the cylinders. 4. Open the cylinder valve only after connecting the regulator to the cylinder using a proper CGA* regulator. 5. Only equipment suitable for pressures involved can be used with high pressure gases. The pressure ratings for all containers and hardware must be known and equipment must not be used where limits will be exceeded. Glass equipment should not be pre ssurized. A general rule is: do not apply pressure greater than ten (10) inches of wate r, if you are not wearing protective equipment. 6. Never mix gases in a cylinder. Explosion, contamin ation, corrosion, and other hazards can result. Never try to refill gas cylinders or tr ansfer gas from one cylinder to another. 7. To prevent corrosion, regulators, valves, and fitti ngs used in compressed gas systems, which conduct corrosive gases, should be flushe d with nitrogen or dry air after each use. 8. Corrosive gases should be stored for the shortest possible time period, preferably under three months. They cylinder valve stem of corrosive gase s should be worked frequently to prevent freezing. 9. The cylinder valve cap should always be firmly in plac e when the cylinder is not in use. Empty cylinders must be return ed with valve protection caps on. 10. Any system should be leak tested before it is used. To check for leaks, spread soap over all joints. They system is leaking if any bubbles appear. 11. The researcher is responsible for knowing the ch aracteristics of the gases he/she uses: toxicity, flammability, compatibility with materials and other gases. Consult the gases' Material Safety Data Sheets. See page 68 - Hazard Da ta for Common Compressed Gases. PROCEDURES FOR USING COMPRESSED GASES (Cont'd.) 71 OTHER TIPS FOR SAFE HANDLI NG OF COMPRESSED GASES: 12. When disposing of empty cylinders, contact th e Office of Environmental Health & Safety for disposal procedures. Empty cylinders DO NOT go in the trash. 13. If necessary, clean out the cylinder valve opening be fore connecting it to an oxygen regulator or a charging line. This can be done by briefly opening th e cylinder valve. Do not stand in front of the valve opening during such a \"blow ou t\", nor place your hand across it. A \"blow ou t\" must under no circumstances take place close to an open fire or any source of ignition, e.g., during welding. 14. When using regulators, always check that the adjust ment screw has been turned far enough to allow it to move freely in its threads prior to opening the cylinde r valve. With the adjustment screw in this position, the regulat or is closed. 15. Never use pliers or a similar t ool to open a cylinder valve. Some va lves are opened with a special key and others are equipped with hand wheels. It is dangerous to force the valve open by knocking or heating. 16. Initials and stamps engraved on the cylinder shells must not be changed or obliterated. Labels and tags should not be removed. 17. Compressed Breathing Air must at least meet the re quirements for Grade D air as described in ANSI/CGA commodity specification for air. CGA: Compressed Gas Association C. PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING CRYOGENICS 72 The principal hazards posed by the use of cryogenic liquids and system s are burns from human contact with cryogens; pressure buildup in u nvented spaces; and fires, explosions, and asphyxiation, which can result from the evaporation of cryogens. RULES FOR HANDLING CRYOGENICS 1. The appropriate eye and skin protection must be wo rn whenever cryogenic liqui ds are handled, to avoid splashes in the eyes and on the skin. The gloves should be rate d for cryogenic liquids. 2. Clothing or jewelry that can trap cryogenic liquids next to the skin should be avoided; for example, wristwatches, rings, etc. 3. In the event of a splash, immediately flood the ar eas and clothing affected w ith water. For prolonged exposures, seek medical treatment. 4. Cryogenic liquids are capable of causing asphyxiat ion by displacing the air necessary for the support of life, especially when they are used in a confined area. Therefore, they should be used only in well ventilated areas. Whenever transporting tanks of cryogenics that are venting in elevators, make sure another person is waiting for you to exit the elevator. This will insure that you have someone available to summon help should the elevator break down and/or you are overcome by the over-venting of the gas. If at all possible, no one should ride in an elevator with a venting cryogenic tank. 5. Venting should be provided to avoid quick and vi olent pressure changes wh en cryofluids vaporize. 6. Exposed glass areas of glass dewars should be tape d to prevent the spread of broken glass should the container implode. 7. Handle combustible cryogens such as liquid hydrogen and liquid natural gas (LNG) in the same way combustible gases are handled; provide ventilati on, keep away from open flames and other ignition sources, prohibit smoking, and disc harge vent gases to a safe location. 8. Handle cryogenic storage containers carefu lly since they are fragile and expensive. See Appendix M for more information on the Safe Handling of Liquid Nitrogen. D. PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING ETHERS 73 AND PEROXIDIZABLE MATERIALS Ethers have toxic, flamma ble, and explosive properties and are da ngerous, if not handled properly. They are widely used in laboratories on campus. The vapors, when inhaled, produce a depression of the central nervous system. The most common ethers, methyl and ethyl, are particularly dangerous fi re hazards because of their low flash points. Thus, it is necessary to prohibit open flames, electrical sp arks, heat sources, and oxidizing agents when they are being used. Ethers and other peroxidizable materials such as dioxane and tetrahydrofur an can form explosive peroxides, especially after the cont ainer has been opened and stored fo r a length of time. Frequently, an inhibitor has been added by the manu facturer to retard the formation of peroxides, but peroxides may form nevertheless during storage even if the container has never been opened. 1. Ethers should always be handled in a fume hood. This will protec t laboratory occupants from inhaling the vapors and will prevent explosive vapor concentrations from forming. 2. Ethers should be stored in fla mmable storage cabinets. Ethers with low flash points shoul d be stored in explosion proof refrig erators. See Section V.F. 3. Ethers and peroxidizable material s should be ordered only in sma ll quantities and must be dated upon receipt and when opened. USE ETHERS AND PEROXIDI ZABLE MATERIALS UP PROMPTLY AFTER OP ENING. See Appendix G. 4. DO NOT STORE ETHERS IN GR OUND GLASS-STOPPERED BOTTLES. 5. Do not move or open any bottle or can of ether or any peroxidizable compound that has exceeded its expiration date or is of questio nable age. If you find such a container, immediately contact the Office of Environmental Health & Safety in Chemistry B73, which will arrange for its proper disposal. See Appendix G for the Recognition and Handling of Peroxidizable Compounds. 6. Ethers and peroxidizable material s, once they have gone past their ex piration date, are dangerous and are extremely expensive to dispose of. A team of high hazard specialists has to be called in to handle the old peroxidizable material basically as a potential bomb. WATCH THE AGE OF YOUR PEROXIDIZABLE MATERIALS!!!!! E. PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING MERCURY Mercury and mercury-containing co mpounds are highly toxic to humans. Poisoning may be produced by 74 inhaling mercury vapor, fume or dus t; it may also be produced by inges tion of mercury or absorption of mercury through the skin. Organic merc ury compounds are extremely toxic. Acute mercury poisoning, caused by exposure to a high level of mercury over a short period of time, is accompanied by a metallic taste in the mouth, marked salivation, swelling of gums, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. Consult MSDS on sympto ms of mercury exposure. Chronic mercury poisoning, caused by exposure to low levels of mercury over a long period of time, may show the same symptoms as seen in acute pois oning, but these are usually less pronounced and not always recognizable as poisoning. Chronic poisoning affects the nervous system, causing a marked tremor, unsteady gait, and personality changes. Mercury is commonly used in labs in such items as thermometers, fluorescent lamps, manometers, recording instruments, batteries, and diffusion pumps. Exposure to mercury can arise in the following ways: 1. When a mercury spill occurs and is not cleaned up promptly or correctly, the mercury scatters into many droplets, thus increasing the su rface area of the mercury and the rate of evaporation. The rate of evaporation may exceed the capac ity of the room's ventilation to dilu te it. If you accid entally spill mercury, contact the Office of Environmental Health and Safety for assistance in cleaning up the spill. The Office supplies mercury spill kits for small spills. See the following page. 2. When mercury is used in elevated temperatur es, it evaporates quickly. A common occurrence is the breaking of thermometers in ovens by bumpi ng or by raising the oven temperature above the thermometer's capacity, resulting in high levels of mercury vapor. 3. In systems where mercury is under pressure and ruptures may occur, mercury can impact at high velocities. This atomizes the mercury, whic h could result in high levels of mercury vapor being released, should a ru pture occur in the system. 4. Mercury and mercury contaminated materials are considered hazardous wastes by the EPA and must be disposed of as such. See Section VII - Hazardous Waste Disposal Procedures. 5. The University at Albany is in the process of trying to go to a mercury free environment whenever possible. The Environmental Health and Safety Office will replace mercury thermometers with mercury free thermometers, free of charge, whenever possible. Contact the Assi stant Director of EH&S for details. 6. All fluorescent tubes, thermostats, computer mo nitors and batteries, because of their mercury, lead or heavy metal content, are NOT to go out in the trash and are regulated by NYS DEC and U.S. EPA as Universal Waste. Contact the En vironmental Health and Safety Office for disposal procedures. See Appendix N - Universal Waste Disposal Policy and Guidel ines plus Electronics Recycling. 75 PROCEDURES FOR HANDLIN G MERCURY (Cont'd.) GUIDELINES FOR HANDLING MERCURY 1. Place a tray or other containe r under all mercury sources to c ontain any spills that may occur. 2. If a spill should occur, cl ean it up promptly and properly: a. Pick up all visible mercury by gentle sweeping a nd a trapped vacuum line at tached to a tapered glass tube or needle-nose pipette. Avoid sc attering or breaking up the mercury droplets. b. Spread a mercury-spill product over the affected area to pick up any microscopic droplets that may remain; sweep up the waste and dispose of as a hazardous waste. Mercury \"sponges\" may also be used. These spill cl eanup items are available through the Office of Environmental Health & Safety in Chemistry B-73. c. Call the Office of Environmental Health & Safe ty at 2-3495 so that the room can be surveyed for persistent mercury contamination. d. Do not use a broom or an ordinary vacuum clean er to clean up the spill. They will only scatter the droplets further. The Offi ce of Environmental Health & Safety has a mercury vacuum cleaner designed specifically to clean up mercury spills. 3. Store mercury in unbreakable plas tic bottles. Keep containers sealed in a cool, well ventilated area. 4. Use mercury only in a well ventilated area. Practic e good housekeeping to prevent spilled mercury from accumulating. 5. Always wear personal protective equipment when handling mercury, especially protective gloves and goggles, and never eat, drink or smoke where mercury is being used. 6. Organic mercury compounds are extremely toxi c and can be absorbed through the skin with fatal results. Always consult an MSDS be fore handling any mercury or mercury compound. 76 F. PROCEDURES FOR HAND LING ACIDS & ALKALIS Acids and alkalis are corrosive and reactive chemical s. They can cause corrosion of the materials with which they are in contact, including metal containe rs, structures, and equipment. They can also cause serious burns and eye damage to th e people working with them. When in contact with certain metals or chemicals, they can react, re leasing toxic fumes or hydrogen. Acids and alkalis should be stored in cool, well ventilated areas, away from each other, metals, flammables, and oxidizing materials. Their storage areas should be regularly checked for spills and leaks, and suitable spill cleanup materials should be readily available. (Spill cleanup kits are available in the Office of Environmental Health & Safety in Chem istry B73). Protective clothing should be worn whenever acids or alkalis are handled. SUGGESTIONS FOR SAFE USE AND STORAGE 1. When combining an acid with water, pour the acid into the water - stirring slowl y, never the reverse. 2. Cap bottles securely and store them on lower sh elves to reduce the chance of accidental breakage. Do not store acids and alkalis together. Do not store organics with acids or alkalis. Do not store organic acids with inorganic acids. See Section V. 3. Do not leave residues on a bottle or a laboratory bench where another person may come in contact with them. Clean up spills promptly. 4. Wear protective clothing when hand ling acids or alkalis - this includ es the appropriate gloves, apron, chemical splash goggles and/or a face shield. 5. If you have been splashed with acids or alkalis, immediately remove any clothing that may have been saturated. If the splash is in your eye, flush the eye immediately a nd gently for at le ast 15 minutes with copious amounts of water. If the splash is on the body, flood the area with copious amounts of running water for at least 15 minutes - a safety shower is intended for this purpose. When alkaline materials have been splashed in the eye, im mediate and repeated washings are necessary in order to prevent the alkali from penetrating deeply. Seek medical assistance. See Section I-E. 77 PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING ACI DS & ALKALIS (Cont'd.) FOUR ACIDS REQUIRING SPECIAL HAND LING BECAUSE OF THEIR EXTREME HAZARDS 1. Nitric Aci d: Nitric acid is corrosive and its oxides are highly toxic. Nitric acid is also an oxidizing agent that forms flammable and explosive compounds with many materials - for example, ethers and other flammable materials, acetone, and combustible materials. Paper towels used to wipe up a nitric acid spill can ignite spontaneously when dry. Nitric acid should be used only in a hood and should be stored away from combustible materials. Consult a MSDS on Nitric Acid and its many hazards. 2. Perchloric aci d: Perchloric acid forms highly explosive and unstable compounds with many combustible materials and with metals. Unstable perchlorate compounds may co llect in the duct work of improperly installed fume hoods and cause fire or violent explosions. Therefore, perchloric acid should be used with extreme caution and only in a fume hood designed for its use - a perchloric acid hood has corrosion-resistant ductwork and washdown facilities. Only minimum quantities should be kept, with no more than a one pound bo ttle in the laboratory. The container should be stored on a glass tray that is deep e nough to hold the contents of the bottle. No flammables or organic solvents should be used in a perchloric acid hood. Perchloric acid should not be ke pt for more than a year since explosive crystals may form. Discolored perchloric acid should not be touched, it is most likely contaminated and could be dangerous. Contact the Office of Environmental Health & Safety for proper disposal. 3. Picric Aci d: Picric acid can form explosive compounds with ma ny combustible materials. It is especially reactive with me tals or metallic salts. Picric acid may lose water and become unstable during extended storage periods. Never open a bottle of dry or contaminated picric acid as an explosion could occur from the fricti on produced. If you find a container of picric acid that appears old and dry, DO NOT TOUCH IT . Immediately contact the Office of Environmental Health & Safety in Chemistry B73. Picric acid should be stored away from combustible materials and should not be kept for extended periods. Do not use metal spatulas to dispense picric aci d. 4. Hydrofluoric Aci d: Hydrofluoric acid is extremely corrosive and will even attack glass. It is volatile and its vapors may affect the skin and eyes. Burn s from hydrofluoric acid he al slowly and with great difficulty. The Office of Environmental Health an d Safety will provide calcium glutonate gel for immediate use on HF burns. H ydrofluroic acid should be used only in a fume hood while wearing protective clothing. Polyethylene containers must be used for storing hydrofluoric acid and for reactions employing hydrofluoric aci d. Care should be taken to avoid contacting hydrofluoric acid with metals or ammonia since toxic fumes may result. H ydrofluoric Handling Guidelines are available from the EH&S Office. CONSULT AN MSDS WHEN EVER WORKING WITH ANY OF THESE COMPOUNDS 78 G. PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING ALKALI METALS Alkali metals react violently with water, decomp osing the water to give off hydrogen which may be ignited by the heat of reaction. The alkali metals can al so ignite spontaneously in air, especially when the metal is in powdered form and/or the air is moist. SUGGESTIONS FOR SAFE USE AND STORAGE 1. Store alkali metals under mineral oil or kerosene in unbreakable contai ners or covered glass containers. Avoid using oils that contain su lfur since a hazardous reaction may occur. 2. Ordinary fire extinguishers are ineffective on an alkali metal fire . Use only the special, dry powder extinguisher intended for alkali metals - Class D - Combustible Metal. These extinguishers can be found in the corridors of the second and third floor of Chemistry. If you are using alkali metals and need a fire extinguisher, contact the Of fice of Environmental Health & Safety. 3. Any waste alkali metals should be place in a labeled, leak proof contai ner, covered with mineral oil, and disposed of properly. See Section VII. 79 H. PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING NONTOXIC, NOXIOUS ODORS In the event your laboratory produces a nontoxic, noxious odor, make certain all fume hood fans in the laboratory are on, raise the fume hoo ds' sashes approximately one foot, and leave the laboratory, closing the door behind you. Do not open the laboratory's window s and doors to ventilate the laboratory as this allows the odor to travel to other floors and buildings. If the procedures outlined above are followed, the fume hoods will effectively exhaust the odor out of th e laboratory. Do not return to the laboratory until the odor has dissipated. In the event your laboratory produces a nontoxic, noxious odor while usi ng the sink, as when washing out dirty glassware, follow the same procedures outlined above and be sure to leav e the water running in the sink until the odor has dissipated. If you are aware that your work is going to cr eate a nontoxic, noxious odor, contact the Office of Environmental Health & Safety and try to perf orm your experiment after normal working hours. DO NOT DISPOSE OF NOXIOUS MATERIALS IN THE TRASH CONTACT THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH & SAFETY FOR PROPER DISPOSAL PROCEDURES 80 VII. LABORATORY WASTE DISPOSAL 81 A. HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL PROGRAM UNIVERSITY AT ALBANY , STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ha s developed, under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), a complex set of regulat ions to control hazardous wastes. The University is currently holding a permit issued by the EPA as a hazardous waste generator. This permit allows the University, within strict EP A and DEC guidelines, to manage all hazardous waste on campus. The Office of Environmental Health & Safety has instituted the following Hazardous Waste Disposal Program, in order to handle the hazardous waste gene rated on campus. This program is coordinated by the University's Chemical Hygiene O fficer/ Hazardous Waste Specialist. State law (Chapter 719 of the laws of 1981) establis hed criminal penalties fo r the unlawful possession, handling, and disposing of hazardous wastes. Represen tation and indemnification under section 17 of the Public Officer's Law would not be av ailable in cases of liability impos ed under criminal statues. Because of the possibilities of personal liability and prison terms, campus personnel are advised to familiarize themselves with the University's Hazardous Waste Di sposal Program for the proper storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. The procedures stated below are to be followed by campus generators when identifying, storing and di sposing of hazardous waste: 1. IDENTIFICATION The responsibility for the identifica tion of hazardous waste (waste chemicals, waste chemical containing products, and out-of-date chemicals) within the Universi ty necessarily rests with the faculty and staff who have created the waste (generators) in research and in struction. See the followi ng pages for the definitions of generator and hazardous waste. The Chemical Hygiene Officer/ Hazardous Waste Specialist will provide assistance in the identification of hazardous waste. 2. LABELING AND STORAGE All containers of hazardous waste must be properly labeled with free labels provided by the Office of Environmental Health & Safety in Chemistry B73. The waste chemicals must be identified by their proper chemical name (not formulas ), including proportions of a mixture. The label must say \"HAZARDOUS WASTE \". The label must be completed before it will be accept ed for disposal by the Office of Environmental Health & Safet y. The University is liable for the mislabeling of hazardous waste. Do not date the waste as the EHS O ffice will date it, when it is put into the Hazardous Waste Room. Once a container is full, you must call the EHS Office at 2-3495 as soon as possible . All waste must be kept in sealed containers at all times, unless you are active ly pouring into the container. Zip-loc bags for dry debris mu st also be labeled and sealed . It is illegal to evaporate waste. Do not mix incompatible wastes. Ensure the waste container is compatible with the waste and use the appropriately sized container, as our disposal costs are somewhat determined by the container size. 82 HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL PROGRAM (Cont'd.) 3. UNKNOWNS Unknown chemicals cannot be accepted for disposal by the Office of Environmental Health & Safet y. The EHS Office has no way of disposi ng of unknowns. If the person wishing to dispose of the waste chemicals cannot trace down the identity of the waste, the Office of Environmental Health & Safety can have the Univ ersity's Hazardous Waste Disposal Company identify them for a substantial cost to the generator. For this reason, the Office of Environmental Health & Safety strongly encourages Departments and Research ers, that have either departing faculty, staff or students, to have these departing pe rsons identify any waste they may ha ve generated before they leave. The Office of Environmental Health & Safety will a ssist in the identificati on of hazardous waste and arranging for its storage and ultima te disposal. The Office of Envir onmental Health & Safety is not responsible for cleaning abandoned la boratories of waste chemicals. 4. STORAGE, PACKAGING AND COORDINATING DISPOSAL All chemical wastes must be packaged by the gene rator in a manner, which will allow them to be transported and stored without dange r of spillage, escape of dangerous vapors, or hazardous reaction. Again, all wastes must be properly labeled. Once a container of hazardous waste is full or ready to be disposed of, the Hazardous Waste Specialist must be contacted as soon as possible at 2-3495. The Hazardous Waste Specialist will then pick up the waste container as soon as possible and will either put it into storage or pour if off in the Hazardous Waste Ro om. Another container of the same waste stream can not be utilized, until the full waste container has been picked up. Do not accumulate any waste in your lab for longer than 2 months. This does not include full cont ainers of waste, which must be disposed of immediately. Routine disposal of hazardous waste throug h the EH&S Office is encouraged and it's free! 5. TRANSPORTATION The Hazardous Waste Specialist in the O ffice of Environmental Health & Safety must be contacted at 2- 3495, in order to arrange for a pickup of hazardous waste.. 6. CHARGE BACK The Office of Environmental Health and Safety pays for the disposal of routinely generated hazardous waste. The EHS Office tries to reduce the cost of hazardous waste disposal in many ways: by bulking waste chemicals when possible, disposing of full lab packs, using a bid process for contracting with a waste disposal company and by brokeri ng usable chemicals. Even with these combined efforts, the cost for the disposal of waste chemicals far exceeds their orig inal purchase price. It is thus recommended that the researcher order only th e amount of a particular chemical that can be used within a year and/or by a particular research project. This will ultimately sa ve the University money and it is definitely safer to store smaller amounts of chemicals. The researcher a nd/or researcher's Departme nt is responsible for all associated costs for the clean out of a researcher's lab when they leave the Un iversity. Chemical clean outs of labs or other areas are not consid ered routinely generated hazardous wastes. 83 B. DEFINITIONS GENERATOR A generator is anyone who disposes of waste that is defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be a \"hazardous waste\". You are a genera tor if, in your work/resear ch at the University, you produce or find a hazardous chemical that you intend to di scard. It is your respons ibility to ensure that this waste is handled correctly as described in the above Hazardous Waste Disposal Program. Be aware that there are substantial civil and criminal penalties for any person, company, corporation, institution, association, etc. who improperl y disposes of hazardous waste. HAZARDOUS WASTE A waste is defined by EPA to be hazar dous, if it meets ANY of the following: 1. It is a \"solid waste or a combination of solid wastes ( a solid waste includes semi-solid, liquid, or contained gaseous material) which, because of its concentration, quantity, or physical, chemical, or infectious characteri stics, may cause or significantly contribute to an increase in mortality, or an increase in serious irreversible or incapacitating illness, or may pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health, or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, or di sposed of, or otherwise managed.\" 2. It is included in lists of specifically id entifiable compounds publishe d by EPA. See Appendix F - EPA Hazardous Waste List. 3. It is a listed waste mixed with nonhazardous materials. 4. It has the characteristics of being ignitable, corrosive, reacti ve, or EP Toxicity, as defined by EPA. See below. 5. It is personally known to you to be hazardous based upon knowledge of the materials or processes used in producing the waste. 6. The four characteristics that determin e if a waste is hazardous are as follows: a. Characteristic of Ignitability 1. It is a liquid, other than an aqueou s solution containing less than 24% alcohol by volume, and has a flash point of less than 6 0\u00b0C (14 0\u00b0F). 2. It is not a liquid and is capable, under standard temperature and pressure, of causing fire through friction, absorption of moisture, or spontaneous chemical changes and when ignited burns so vigorous ly and persistently that it creates a hazard. 3. It is an ignitable compressed gas; any material or mixture having in the container an absolute pressure exceeding 40 p.s.i. at 7 0\u00b0F or any liquid flammable material having a vapor pressure ex ceeding 40 p.s.i. absolute at 10 0\u00b0F. 84 HAZARDOUS WASTE DEFINITIONS (Cont'd.) 4. It is an oxidizer; a substance such as a chlorate, permanganate, inorganic peroxide, or a nitrat e, that yields oxygen readily to stimulate the combustion of organic matter. b. Characteristic of Corrosivity 1. It is aqueous and has a pH less than or equal to 2, or greater than or equal to 12.5, as determined by a pH meter. 2. It is a liquid and corrodes steel (SAE 1020) at a rate greater than 6.35 mm (0.250 inches) per year at a test temperature of 5 5\u00b0C (13 0\u00b0F) as determined by test methods specified by the National Asso ciation of Corrosion Engineers. c. Characteristic of Reactivity 1. It is normally unstable and readily undergoes violent change without detonating, 2. It reacts violently with water, 3. It forms potentially expl osive mixtures with water, 4. When mixed with wate r, it generates toxic gase s or vapors in a quantity sufficient to present a danger to hum an health or the environment, 5. It is a cyanide or sulfide-bearing wa ste which, when exposed to pH conditions between 2 and 12.5, can generate toxic ga ses or vapors in a qua ntity sufficient to present danger to human health or the environment, 6. It is capable of detona tion or explosive reaction if it is subjected to a strong initiating source or if h eated under confinement, 7. It is readily capable of detonation or explosive decomposition or reaction at standard temperature and pressure, 8. It is a forbidden explosive, a Class A explosive or a Class B explosive as defined in 49 CFR 173.51 and 173.53 (see section 370.1(e) of this Title). d. Characteristic of EP (Extra ction Procedure) Toxicity (1) A solid waste exhibits the characteris tic of toxicity if, using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure, Te st Method 1311 in \"Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemi cal Methods,\" EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in subdivision 370.1(e) of this Title, the extract from a representative sample of th e waste contains any of the contaminants listed in Table 1 at a concentration equal to or greater than the respective value given in that Table. Where the waste contains less than 0.5 per cent filterable solids, the waste itself, after filtering using the methodology outlined in Method 1311, is considered to be the extract for the purpose of this subdivision. All solid wastes containing 50 parts per million ( ppm) by weight (on a dry weight basis for other than liquid wastes) or greater of polychlorinate d biphenyls (PCBs) are listed hazardous wastes. There are a very few exceptions to this, small capa citors and drained PCB articles as defined in NYS DEC's regulations Part 371. Please contact th e EHS Office with any questions on PCB wastes. All non-empty aerosol cans are considered hazard ous waste, as are all compressed gas cylinders, whether they are empty or not. 85 Table 1. -- Maximum Concentration of Contaminants for the Toxicity Characteristic Contaminant Concentration for Toxicity EPA HW 0.2 FOOTNOTE 1: Hazardous waste number. FOOTNOTE 2: Chemical abstracts service number. FOOTNOTE 3: Quantitation limit is greater than the calculated regulatory level. The quantitation limit therefore becomes the regulatory level. FOOTNOTE 4: If o-, m-, and p-Cresol concentrations cannot be differentiated, the total cresol (D026) concentratio n is used. The regulatory level of total cresol is 200 mg/l. (2) A solid waste that exhibits the characteristic of toxicity has the EPA Hazardous Waste Number specified in Table 1 which corresponds to the toxic contaminant causing it to be hazardous. 87 C. HAZARDOUS WASTE LABEL These labels are provided for free by the Office of Environmental Health and Safety in Chemistry B73. All Hazardous Waste should be labeled with the words \"Hazardous Waste\" and the container's contents should be listed, no abbreviations or chemical formulas allowed. DO NOT DATE YOUR WASTE. EHS dates it when it is put into the Hazardous Waste Room. 88 D. EMPTY CHEMICAL CONTAINER AND GLASSWARE DISPOSAL POLICY In order to dispose of empty chem ical containers (bottl es, used glassware or cans), they must be: 1. Triple rinsed, with water or the appropriate solvent, depending on the chemical residues in the containers.* This is done in orde r to prevent a potentia l hazardous materials incident, when the containers are transported and crushed for disposal; 2 . The containers' labels made illegible; 3. The tops taken off the clean containers and the cont ainers taken to the C.A.S. Stores in Chemistry B13 for disposal. Call C.A.S. St ores at 2-4409 before you bring down your empty containers, so you can be sure someone is there to receive them. You must sign the l og book In C.A.S. Stores when you are dropping off empty chemical containers. Empty chemical containers MUST NOT be left in the tunnel or in corr idors. The C.A.S. Stores personnel will handle the disposal of all cl ean, empty chemical containers. Small pieces of clean glassware or broken glassware should be placed in a container specifically for glasswar e disposal. They should not be placed in the regular trash. Cardboard boxes, lined w ith plastic bags, specifica lly for glassware disposal, can be gotten for free from C.A.S. Stores. Once th ese boxes are full, they can be taken back down to C.A.S. Stores for disposal. The custodial staff is not responsible for the disposal of empty chemical containers or broken glassware. A compressed gas cylinder is considered empty when the pressure in the cylinder approaches atmospheric. Compressed gas cylinders are still cons idered hazardous materials even when empty. If you have empty lecture size gas cylinders or smaller to dispose of, contact the Office of Environmental Health & Safety. Disposal of larger size gas cylinders is handled through C.A.S. Stor es in Chemistry B13. If you have any questions on the disposal of any type of waste or container, call the Office of Environmental Health & Safety at 2-3495. * The rinsate from Acute Hazardous Waste C ontainers (P Listed Wastes) is also co nsidered a hazardous waste. The solvent you use to rinse a container may also be considered a hazardous waste. 89 E. DISPOSAL OF REGULATED MEDICAL WASTE Regulated medical waste is regulated by the NYS Department of Health. For more information on Managing Regulated Medical Waste, go to h ttp://www.health.state. ny.us/faciliti es/waste/ A.

D. \"Infectious Agents\" means any organisms that cause disease or an adverse health impact to humans, except that the Commissioner may prescribe by regul ation additional infectious agents as may be necessary to protect heal th and the environment. If any waste generated in your laborat ories fits the definitions above, it is \"regulated medical waste\" and must be handled and disposed of accordi ngly. Regulated Medical Waste must be red-bagged . The red bags, which have the universal biohazard symbol ar e available for purchase from C.A.S. Stores in Chemistry B13. The University has an agreement with Stericycle for pick up and di sposal of this type of waste. Currently, the University Health Center and the Animal Facility are th e primary generators of medical waste. If you have regulat ed medical waste to dispose of, pl ease contact the EH&S Office at 2-3495 for further instructions. ***REGULATED MEDICAL WASTE CAN NOT BE AUTOCLAVED AND PUT IN TH E REGULAR TRASH FOR DISPOSAL AT THE UNIVERSITY AT ALBANY. 91 F. HANDLING PROCEDUR ES FOR SHARPS, GLA SS, & BIOHAZARDOUS AUTOCLAVED WASTE Sharps Needles, syringes, and scalpel blades , etc. appear to most always be considered regulated medical wa ste under the \"sharps\" category (see Sec tion E. above), and must be dispos ed of in the red plastic sharps containe rs available for purchase through C. A.S. Stores. C.A.S. Stores charges a small fee for the sharps container, which includes the cost of the container's disposal as regulated medical waste. When the container is full, bring it back to C.A.S. Stores for proper disposal as regulated medical waste. This is also required to comply with the University's policy \"Gui delines for the Procurement, Stor age, Use, and Destruction and Di sposal of Hypodermic Supplies\". The University has a contract with Stericycle for pick up and disposal of this type of waste. Glass Any glass items you wish to dispos e of, which do not fall into the categories of regulated medical waste and that do not need to be trea ted otherwise (e.g. autoclaved), should be placed in a container separate from other lab trash. Glass pipett es contaminated with biohazardous material s must go out in Sharps' containers . The glass items should be as clean as possible. Most laboratories alr eady have some type of container de dicated to glass disposal, only . If you don't have a separate cont ainer for glass, a sturdy cardboard box lined with a heavy plastic bag is suitable. These are available for free from the C.A.S. Stores in Chemistry B13. The reason for separa ting glass from other trash, to avoid puncture wounds, should be obvi ous. All boxes used for glass disposal should be labeled \"Clean Gl ass Only.\" When the lined cardboard box is full of glass, please seal the box w ith tape and take to C.A.S. Stores for disposal. Biohazardous Autoclaved Waste Any culture dishes, test tubes, Pasteur pipettes, etc., that do NOT categorize as \"regulated medical waste\" (See Section E. above) should be placed in an orange autoclave bag labeled with the universal biohazard symbol prior to autoclaving. When you are ready to autoclave a full, orange bag, put copious amounts of autoclave indicator tape on the bag before you run it through the autoclave. The indicator tape signa ls that the orange bag has been through the autoclave and that the materials inside have been inactivated. Once the orange autoclave bag has been through the autoclave, it should be placed in a dark, opaque garbage bag for disposal in the regu lar trash. The orange autoclave bags, indi cator tape and dark, opaque garbage ba gs are available for purchase from C.A.S. Stores. ***REGULATED MEDICAL WASTE CAN NOT BE AUTOCLAVED AND PUT IN THE REGULAR TRASH FOR DISPOSAL AT THE UNIVER SITY AT ALBANY.

APPENDICES 93 APPENDIX A. - REACTIVE CHEMICALS Reactive chemicals are substances, which under certain ambient or induced conditi ons, enter into violent reactions with spontaneous gene ration of large quanti ties of heat, light, gases (flammable and nonflammable), or toxicants that can be destructive to lives and property. The types of reactive chemicals have been loosely categorized: 1. Explosive - Many substances, when mixed, are potentially explosive (such as hydrazines and nitric acid). In general, protect these substances from shock, elevated temperatures, rapid temperature changes, and other reactive chemicals. Some exampl es: nitroglycerin, nitrocellulose, organic peroxides and metal azides. 2. Oxidizing and Reducing Substances - In many oxidizing and reducing r eactions, both agents must be present. However, in some cases, one or the other substance creates a hazard by coming into contact with a normally innocuous substance. The reacti ons tend to generate heat and are often explosive. Some oxidizing agents: oxygen, agents: hydrog en, metallic hydrides, alkali metals, and pyrophoric agents such as activated zinc and phosphorus. 3. Water Sensitive Substances - These chemicals react with water, steam, and moisture in the air to evolve heat and/or flammable or explosive gases. Isolate water-sensitive substances from other reactive compounds. Store them in a cool, waterproof area. No water should service the storage area. Some substances that liberate heat only are: str ong acids and bases, acid anhydrides and sulfides. Some substances that liberate fla mmable gases are: alkali metals, hydrid es, nitrides, carbides, and anhydrous metallic salts. 4. Acid Sensitive Substances - These chemicals react with acid to evolve heat, flammable and/or explosive gases, and toxicants. Some examples are: alkali metals, hydroxide s, arsenic and related elements, cyanid es, sulfides, and structural alloys (most metals). 5. Special Organic Compounds - These compounds are unstable and may decompose spontaneously or through contact with the immediate environment (air, water, and other r eactants). compounds. 6. Pyrophoric Agents - Pyrophoric agents burn when exposed to ai r. In general, they require absolute protection against air. Exam ples: phosphorus and activated zinc. 94 REACTIVE CHEMICALS (Cont'd.) The following is a list of some specific HIGHLY REACTIVE CHEMICALS and their associated hazards (Note - this is not all inclusive): HYDROFLUORIC ACID - This is a very insidious material. After any contact with a solution of hydrofluoric acid, even if there is no immediate pain, the area should be flushed with copious amounts of water for at least 5 minutes then apply calcium glut onate gel (available from the Environmental Health and Safety Office in Chemistry B73.) Consult a physician promptly. PHENOL - When phenol is dissolved in organic solvents it is readily absorbed into the blood stream, resulting in serious or fatal poisoni ng. If phenol is accidentally spilled, flush area with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Consult a physician promptly. BROMINE - Bromine can be measured volumetrically with l ittle hazard. Keep a dilute sodium bisulfite solution on hand to destroy any accidentally spilled bromine. HYDROGEN CYANIDE - Hydrogen cyanide should always be used under a hood. Liquid hydrogen cyanide is best kept over anhydrous calcium chloride. It thus remains water-white for months. Formation of a yellow color in the liquid indi cates the lot shoul d be destroyed. PERCHLORATES - Perchlorates should be handled only by persons thoroughly familiar with the hazards involved. Do not use magnesium perchlorate as a desiccant, except in the standard procedure for the determination of carbon and hydrogen. DICHROMATE CLEANING SOLUTION - Dichromate cleaning solution is an extremely corrosive agent. Never transfer the cleani ng solution from a pipette washer by pouring. Use a siphon. Follow these precautions when using the cleaning solution: a. Keep the bottle caps loosened; b. Store the solutions in a cool area, away from other chemicals; c. Keep protective equipment avai lable in case of a spill (i.e., respir ator, acid-resistant gloves, spill clean up kit, etc.); d. Dichromate cleaning solutions are consider ed hazardous waste. PHOSPHORUS TRIHALIDES - Containing moisture, may under certain circumstances, form some phosphine when heated, and explode violently when exposed to air. Red phosphorus and hydriodic acid may also form explosive compounds. These materials should be heated in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide. 95 REACTIVE CHEMICALS (Cont'd.) PHOSPHORUS OXYCHLORIDE - A serious accident occurred when this chemical was being distilled under vacuum. The vacuum changed and water ran b ack into the phosphorus oxychloride and the mixture exploded. This chemical should be distilled at normal pressure. If it is absolutely necessary to use a vacuum; adequate traps should be provided between th e water pump and the receiv ed. (Other chemicals in the same category are: SO2Cl2, SOCl2, S2Cl2, PCl2, etc. Similar precautions should be employed in all vacuum distillations in which a water pump is used, b ecause sudden loss of pressure will force water back up into the apparatus being evacuated. A Bunsen valv e in the trap will avoid much of this difficulty. BENXOYL PEROXIDE - when dry, benzoyl peroxide is easily ignited and sensitive to shock. It will decompose spontaneously at temperatures above 5 0\u00b0C. It must be stored in a cool place. Keep away from all sources of heat. Do not subject it to friction or grinding in the dry state, since the heat generated will cause it to explode. This chemical is desensitized by the addition of at least 20% by weight of water (from DuPont Safety Manual). ALUMINUM CHLORIDE - Should be considered a potentially dangerous material. If moisture is present, sufficient decomposition to build up considerable pressure may re sult. If a bottle is to be opened after long standing, enclose it completely in a he avy towel and place the covered bottle in a metal container before opening the lid. Be sure to wear protective equipment. AMMONIA and MERCURY - In contact, these chemicals ha ve been known to form explosive compounds (Ind. Eng. Chem., New Edition, 1932). HYDROXYL AMINE DERIVATIVES - Particularly those related to hydroxy aminic acid, should be treated as explosive compounds. Di stillation of products in which they may be present should be conducted behind screens with all safe ty precautions taken. Acid salts of hydroxyl amine are explosive; hydroxyl may contain residual salts. CYANOGEN BROMIDE - Is explosive in the solid state unless it is absolutely white. Do not keep bottles of it tightly stoppered. PYRUVIC ACID - Has been reported to blow up while standing on the shelf. o-NITROBENZOYL CHLORIDE - Has exploded violently upon atte mpted distillation (Ind. Eng. Chem., New Ed., 23, 2394, (1945):JACS 68, 344, (1946)). NITRILES - Nitriles react similarly to hydrogen cyanide and should be handled under a hood. Any part of the body which has come in contact with any of these materials should be flushed with copious amounts of water for at least 15 mi nutes. Consult a physician promptly. Nitrile compounds in a vapor state are very toxic when inhaled and the same pr ecautions used with hydrogen cyanide are necessary. ACRYLONITRILE (VINYL CYANIDE) - Is a very active poison. It is fatal immediately when breathed in a concentration of 270 ppm. (In. H ygiene and Toxicology, February, 1942, pg. 255). 96 REACTIVE CHEMICALS (Cont'd.) NITRIC OXIDE, NITROGEN DIOXIDE and ITS POLYMERS - Are produced when nitric acid reacts with organic materials. They are extremely dangerous becau se they give no warning. Never inhale them. If you do inhale them accidentally, get to fresh air, and consu lt a physician immediately. DOWTHERM AND ALLIED HEAT-TRANSFER AIDS - While not active poisons, these have a cumulative effect which results in bodily changes af ter long exposure. They ar e readily absorbed by the skin and by clothing, particularly leather and wool. If exposed, wash the exposed parts and the clothing. Low concentrations of the vapor ar e detectable by odor when the expos ure is infrequent, but continual exposure desensitizes the olfactory nerves so the odor is no longer a pparent. Such exposure should be avoided. PHOSGENE - Phosgene is extremely dangerous because its symptoms are delayed for 4 to 8 hours, when small but toxic amounts are inhaled. If accidenta lly inhaled, consult a physician promptly. CYANURIC CHLORIDE - Cyanuric chloride is a lachrymator and may cause severe burns of the mucous membranes. Use only in a well-ventilated hood. When distilling it, use of the same precautions as for other acid chlorides. EPICHLOROHYDRIN - Undiluted epichlorohydrin is intensely irritating to the skin. Because of the potential nephrotic effects, persons worki ng with this materials on a conti nuing basis should undergo medical supervision. (Univ. Calif., the Toxicity of Epichlorohydrin, 1941, pamphlet, in Library). DIMETHYL SULFATE - Dimethyl sulfate is an extremely reac tive material, especially when it comes in contact with the skin or mucous membranes. A ve ry short time of contact with the mucous membranes will result in painful burns. If it comes in contact with the eye, sight will be impaired if it is not removed immediately. Flush the eye and/or skin with copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. Consult a physician promptly. DIOXANE - Dioxane appears to be a poisonous compound with a delayed reaction. This material should be handled cautiously and not inhaled. Dioxane can readily form dangerous peroxides. See Appendix G. In addition to precautions to be taken during its distil lation, condensation of its distilled vapors should be done with water above 1 2\u00b0C to prevent plugging the condenser. BENZENE, TOLUENE, and CARBON TETRACHLORIDE - These chemicals are readily absorbed through intact skin, as well as throug h the respiratory tract. Do not handl e them carelessly. Use only in a fume hood. Benzene and carbon tetrachloride ar e suspected or confirmed human carcinogens. Always consult a chemical's Material Sa fety Data Sheet before first using it. 97 APPENDIX B. GLOVE SELECTION The following links are for companies that may suppl y gloves to laboratories at the University at Albany. Available on each website are chemical compatibility charts for the gloves supplied by each specific company. Please use them to verify that th e gloves being used to handl e a specific chemical are providing proper protection to the wearer . It is important to note that all chemicals may not be listed on the charts, and that two similar gloves supplied by two different co mpanies may not provide the same level of protection. It is importa nt, therefore, to use the compatibili ty chart for the manufacturer of the glove being used.

There are several articles available on this topi c that are too long to include in this manual. APPENDIX H. - WASTE MINIMIZATION POLICY In accordance with Federal and state re gulations, the University at Albany is required to have an on-gong hazardous waste minimization program. Hazardous Waste Minimization is the reduction, to the extent feasible, of hazardous waste that is generated or subsequently trea ted, stored, or disposed. Waste minimization includes any source reduc tion or recycling activity undertaken by a generator that results in: (1) the reduction of total vol ume or quantity of hazardous waste; (2) the reduction of toxicity of hazardous waste; or (3) both, as long as th e reduction is consistent with the goal of minimizing present and future threats to human health and the environment. Over the last ten years, the University has unde rtaken several waste minimization activities. The Chemistry Department has significantly minimized th e hazardous waste generate d in their teaching labs by changing the types of experiments performed, by converting to less toxic chemicals and by performing microchemistry techniques. The Office of Environm ental Health and Safety has been proactive in recycling waste and providing information when aske d on the toxicity of chemicals before they are ordered. The EHS Office strongly encourages waste minimization efforts on campus and suggests the following: 1. ALWAYS ORDER THE SMALLEST QUANT ITY NEEDED OF ANY CHEMICAL as it is safer to store and less expensive to dispose of smaller quantities. For the most part, it is more expensive to dispose a chemical correctly than it is to purchase it. 2. Whenever possible try to order th e least toxic chemical required for your research. The Material Data Safety Sheet can provide you with this informa tion or you can contact our o ffice in Chemistry B73 at 2-3495. 3. When you are finished with a chemical and you are not intending on using it for another two years or so, do not hang on to it. Try to broker it to a fellow re searcher. Old chemicals can pose a serious safety hazard especially when peroxidizable or highly r eactive. See the University's Chemical Hygiene Plan, Appendix G. 4. Label all Chemical containers with their contents even if non- hazardous. Unknown chemicals are expensive to identify and could pose a potentially serious health and safety hazard. 5. When leaving University employment, please cont act the Office of Environmental Health and Safety so that we can facilitate appr opriate chemical clean out of your labs. 118 APPENDIX I. - IDENTIFICATIO N, CONTROL AND PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING OF EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS Procedures for identification, control, handling and di sposal of hazardous chemicals is a major part of the University's Chemical Hygiene Plan. To reduce expos ure to recognized risks a nd for compliance with the OSHA Standard \"Occupational Exposures to Hazardous Chemicals in Laboratories,\" this appendix for handling extremely hazardous chemicals should be added to your Chemical Hygiene Plan. DEFINITIONS of EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS: A chemical or substance generally regarded by the scientific community as having properties that represent substantial risks to humans a ssociated with the use, storage or disposal of the chemical. This can include select carcinogens, reproduc tive toxins, extremely flammable liquids, reactive materials and extremely toxic chemicals. The select carcinogens are those picked by various governmental agencies and are included on the lists attached to this appendi x. Reproductive toxins are ch emicals which affect the reproductive capabilities incl uding chromosomal damage (mutations ), and/or have effects on fetuses (teratogenesis). Extremely flammable liquids have an NFPA rating of 4. Reactive chemicals have an NFPA rating of 3 or 4. Extremely toxic chemicals have an NFPA health rating of 4 and/or usually have a LD 50 in rodents of less than 25 mg/kg, when admini stered orally, although othe r factors can be included. NFPA ratings can be found on the substance' s Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING EXTR EMELY HAZARDOUS MATERIALS: 1. The precautions and procedures described in the University's Chemical Hygiene Plan for the safe handling of chemicals must be adhered too, in addition to the follo wing specific laboratory procedures. 2. Before beginning a laboratory op eration, one is required to read and understand information found on the Material Safety Data Sheets for every h azardous chemical used duri ng the laboratory operation. 3. If extremely hazardous chemicals are used, then it is desirable that there be two persons present in the laboratory at all times. 4. Protect hands and forearms by wearing a lab coat and suitable long gloves. Always wear chemical splash goggles. AVOID any c ontact with hazardous chemicals. 119 5. All procedures involvi ng hazardous chemicals must be performe d in a fume hood or biological cabinet (or other suitable containment device.) 6. After handling or working with hazardous material s, wash hands and arms immediately. NEVER eat, drink, smoke, chew gum, apply cosmetics, ta ke medicine, or store food in areas where hazardous chemicals are being used or stored. 7. All hazardous chemicals should be labeled with appropriate warnings (Cancer-Suspect Agent, Reactive, etc.) Label all research vessels. 8. Approved DESIGNATED AREA signs must be posted in all designated areas. A designated area \"means an area which may be used for work with select carcinogens' (see attached lists), reproductive toxins or substanc es which have a high degree of acute to xicity. A designated area may be the entire laboratory, area of a labor atory or a device such as a labo ratory fume hood.\" The DESIGNATED AREA signs attached to this appendix (on the next page) must be filled out with the appropriate information and posted by that area. If the chemical s used in that area change, the sign must also be changed. Additional signs are available in the Office of Environmental Health and Safety in Chemistry B73. 9. Written emergency procedures can be found in th e MSDS for each hazardous chemical in the lab's MSDS notebook. (If the MSDS is not in the no tebook, contact the Environm ental Health and Safety Department for assistance in obtaining the MS DS or visit the EH&S Web page - Useful Links) Persons working in the lab must be familiar with these procedures before the chemical is worked with, in case of chemical spills and accidents. Refer to the University's Chemical Hygiene Plan for Chemical Spill Procedures. 10. The Office of Environmental Health and Sa fety should review labor atory procedures or experiments using extremely hazardous chemi cals first. The EH&S Offi ce may require additional procedures or requirements. Coordination with the EHS Department is essential prior to commencement of experiments utilizing extremely hazardous chemicals. 11. Laboratory vacuum pumps used with hazardous chemicals should be ve nted into a fume hood. 12. Hazardous and extremely hazardous chemical waste must be turned into the Office of Environmental Health and Safety for proper disposal. Refer to the University's Chemical Hygiene Plan for proper waste disposal procedures. 120 DESIGNATED AREA FOR EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS/SELECT ALDEHYDE POLICY The Appendix reviews the OSHA standard 1910.1048 fo r Formaldehyde. The standard applies to all occupational exposures to formalde hyde, i.e. from formaldehyde gas, its solutions, and materials that release formaldehyde. 1. The University (employe r) shall assure th at no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of formaldehyde which ex ceeds 0.75 parts formaldehyde per million parts of (0.75 ppm) as an 8-hour TWA - Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL). The University shall also assure that no employee is exposed to an airborne conc entration of formaldehyde, which exceeds two parts formaldehyde per million parts of air (2 ppm), as a 15-minute Short Term Exposure Limit (STEL). 2. The University shall m onitor their employees to de termine their exposure to formaldehyde. The Office of Environmental Hea lth and Safety will conduct all monitoring for formaldehyde. All principal inves tigators using formaldehyde (thi s includes formalin) in their research, in their teaching labs, or storing specimens in formaldehyde must notify the Office of Environmental Health and Safety in Chemistry B73, so that their employees receive the appropriate monitoring to determine their exposures. Employees include faculty, staff, lab assistants, graduate students and teaching assistants. Monitoring of the empl oyee must be repeated if there is a change in usage of the formaldehyde, which may result in ne w or additional exposure formaldehyde. Principal investigators must inform the Offi ce of Environmental Health and Safe ty if their employees show signs or symptoms of respiratory or dermal condi tions associated with formaldehyde exposure. 3. The University will notify in writing the employ ees of their monitoring re sults within 15 days of receiving the results. If monito ring results are over the PEL or STEL the University will take the necessary actions as defined in 1910.1048. 4. The Office of Environmental Health and Safety will select and provide protective clothing and equipment based upon the form of formaldehyde to be encountered, to those employees exposed to formaldehyde. All contact of th e eyes and skin with li quids, containing 1 percent or more formaldehyde, shall be prevented by the usag e of other chemical protective clothing made of material impervious to formaldehyde and the use of other personal protective equipment, such as goggles and face shields, as appropriate to the operat ion. Contact with irritating or sensitizing materials shall be prevented to the extent necessary to eliminate the hazard. 122 5. In areas where formaldehyde is used, quick drench showers and acceptable eyewash facilities must be immediately av ailable. The Office of Environmental Health and Safety will provide the showers an d eyewashes where necessary upon notification. APPENDIX J. - Formaldehyde Policy cont'd. 6. The principal investigator shall routinely conduct visu al inspections to detect l eaks or spills in areas where formaldehyde is used or stored. The Office of Environmental Health a nd Safety will do periodic monitoring in the above areas. 7. The University shall make medical surveillance available for all employees who develop signs and symptoms of overexposure to formaldehyde and fo r all employees exposed to formaldehyde in emergencies. This will be arranged through the Of fice of Environmental Health and Safety in Chemistry B73. 8. All containers of formaldehyde, all mixt ures or solutions co mposed of greater than 0.1% formaldehyde, and materials capab le of releasing formaldehyde into the air, under reasonably foreseeable conditions of use, at conc entrations reaching or ex ceeding 0.1 ppm shall be labeled with the appropriate hazard warnings. The labeling is the responsibility of the user. 9. The Office of Environmental Health and Safety will provide annual training on the specific health hazards of formaldehyde , on the contents of this policy and the OSHA standard to all employees exposed to formaldehyde at or above 0.1 ppm. 10. All areas where formaldehyde is being used should be posted as a \"D esignated Area\" as defined in Appendix I of the University's Chemical Hygiene Pl an. If a Designated Area si gn is required, please contact the Office of Envir onmental Health and Safety. 11. In order to eliminate exposure of employees to formaldehyde and its solutions, it should be used in a fume hood whenever possible. If you have any questions, regarding this policy, please contact the Office of Environmental Health and Safety in Chemistry B73. 123 APPENDIX K. - The Use of Controlled Substances in Research Policy Statement Certain research activitie s conducted under the auspices of the Univ ersity require the use of controlled substances. Controlled substances, which are substances with high potential for abuse, are identified in the schedules contained within the \"C ontrolled Substances Inventory Li st,\" published by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). In conducting research with controlled substances, University authorized employees must comply with federal a nd state laws and regulati ons regarding their use, including DEA registration and New York State Department of Health licensure; storage requirements; inventory maintenance; substance disposal; and reporti ng and record keeping, in accordance with Title 21, Part 1300-1308 of the Code of Fede ral Regulations (CFR) and Article 33 of the New York State Public Health Law. Responsible Party Authorized University or Research Foundation employees, including princi pal investigators or supervisors of research in which controlled substances are used, b ear full responsibility for complying with federal and state laws and regul ations, and with University policy regarding their use. Specifically, they are responsible for: Obtaining and maintaining appropria te licensure from the New York State Department of Health. Obtaining and maintaining appropriate registration from the DEA. Submitting copies of the license and registration to the representative Departments, each time they are issued or renewed. Establishing security measures for the purchase, acceptance, use, and ultimate disposal of the controlled substances used in their research. Principal investigators or supervisors of research, in which controlled substances will be used, are responsible for obtaining approval for their use from all applicable University committees that oversee human subject and animal subjects research (e.g., the Institutional Review Board, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) and must report their intenti on to use controlled substances to external funding sponsors upon submission of grant app lications. Individuals who have obt ained relevant approvals for the use of controlled substances will be authorized to purchase, accept, and appropriately dispose of these substances. 124 (If the controlled item is to be used within the cont ext of the activities of an organized research unit, which are outside of the operation of a specific sponsored project, the director of this research unit will be responsible for complying with fede ral and state laws and regulations regarding the use of controlled substances, and must notify the representative Departments. (Note: The Director of the Colle ge of Arts and Sciences Technical Services Group is the University employee responsible for the purchase, acceptance, stor age, use, and disposal of syringes and needles.) Purchasing Controlled Substances Orders for controlled substances by DEA registrants (i.e., authorized University or Research Foundation employees) must be submitted to the Office of Purc hasing and Contracts on a requisition signed by the registrant or authorized designee. The requisition must be acc ompanied by DEA Form 222 and a copy of the DEA registration. Prior to executing the order, the Office of Purchasing and Contracts will obtain a verification from the appropriate Depa rtments and/or Principa l Investigator(s) that research, in which the ordered controlled substance is to be used, has been approved for its use and is an active project or program. Receiving Controlled Substances The controlled substances must be shipped to th e registrant and address as indicated on the DEA registration. Once received, the co ntrolled substances should be opened to verify the contents and any discrepancies should be rectified with the supplier. If necessary, DEA should be contacted. From the time a controlled substance is accepted on campus until it is consumed or disposed of, a record (disposition record) of the chain of custody must be kept at each point where the s ubstance changes hands or is used. The record is completed at each point by the person de livering the substance and includes the name of the substance, the quantity, and the signature of the person receiving it. The person making the withdrawal shall sign all records of withdrawals of controlled substances from storage. Continuing Records and Inventory The registrant shall maintain an accurate continuing record or log of each contro lled substance received, disposed of or otherwise used by him or he r, in accordance with 21 CFR 1304.21 and 1304.24. The registrant for each registered location and for each independent activity for which the registrant is registered shall maintain separate records. The registra nt must maintain the continuing records for 5 years. The records shall include the following information: 1. Name of each substance kept at the site. 2. Identification of each finished form and the number of units or total volume of each finished form in each commercial container. 125 3. The number of commercial containe rs of each finished form received; the date of and number of containers in each receipt; and the name, addre ss, and registration number of the source from which the containers were received. 4. The amount of each finished form transferred or used, including the name and address of the person(s) to whom it was given, the date of tr ansfer, the name of the individual who used the substance, and the reason it was used. 5. The number of units or volume of the finished form s and/or commercial cont ainers disposed of in any other manner, as well as the da te and manner of the disposal. Inventory An accurate inventory of controlled substances mu st be maintained by each DEA registrant. The registrant will conduct an annual inve ntory and reconciliation as part of a self-audit. Inventories for schedule I and II controlled substances shall be maintained separately from other laboratory records. A copy of the completed inventory must be retained fo r 5 years and be made available to University or regulatory authorities when requested. The inventory will include the following information: 1. Name of substance. 2. Each finished form of the substance. 3. Number of units or total volum e of each finished form in each commercial container. 4. Number of commercial containers of each such finished form. (For guidance regarding damaged, defective, or impure substance awaitin g disposal, see 21CFR 1304.15(d).) Any discrepancy in the con tinuing record or inventory of controlled substances must be reported to the University Police and their Depart ments immediately upon discovery. Storage All DEA registrants must provide eff ective controls and procedures to gua rd against theft and diversion of controlled substances. Controlled substances must be stored in a securely locked, substantially constructed cabinet. The following are considered in determining security requirements: the type of activity, the type and form of contro lled substance, the quantity of cont rolled substance, the location of the premises, the type of building construction, the type of vault, safe, and secure enclosures, the adequacy of key control systems, the adequacy of el ectric detection and alarm systems, the extent of unsupervised public access, the adequacy of superv ision over employees with access, procedures for handling visitors, the availability of local police a nd adequacy of the use and disposal tracking system (CFR 1301.71-1301.76). Disposal 126 The registrant having custody of th e controlled substance sh all dispose of the controlled substance in accordance with NYS Department of Health, Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement (BNE) and the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Admini stration (DEA), Office of Diversion Control. 1st OPTION: Contact the purchasing vendor and determine if they can accept the controlled substances. 2nd OPTION: Visit the following link and dispose of your controlled substances through an approved reverse distributor. http://www.health.state.ny.us/professionals/na rcotic/pharmacies/surre nder_to_independent_co mpanies.htm 3rd OPTION: Visit the following link and request the assistance of the US De partment of Justice's Drug Enforcement Administration for the disposal of your controlled substances. http://www.deadiversion.usdoj .gov/21cfr/cfr /1307/1307_21.htm Any questions or difficulties regarding the disposal of controlled substances s hould be directed to the Office of Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) at 442-3495 in Chemistry B73. They will advise the registrant on how to dispose of the controlled substance. The EH S Office is not responsible for the ultimate disposal of the controlled substances but rather the registrant. A copy of all disposal forms should be sent to th e EH&S Office in Chemistry B73 for our disposal records. The Principal Investigator should also retain copied of these disposal records fo r their files.

Do not ever use liquid air or liquid oxygen in these dewars because either of which could present a co mbustion hazard with some materials used in the construction of these dewars, or materials stored in them. Introduction The safe handling and use of liquid nitrogen in liquid nitrogen dewars or flasks is possible only by knowing the potential hazards and us ing common-sense procedures ba sed on that knowledge. There are two important properties of liquid nitroge n that present potential hazards: 1. It is extremely cold. At atmospheric pressure , liquid nitrogen boils at -320\u00b0F / -196\u00b0 C. 2. Very small amounts of liquid vapor ize into large amounts of gas. One liter of liquid nitrogen becomes 24.6 ft3/0.7 m3 of gas. The safety precautions as outlined must be followed to avoid potential injury or damage which could result from these two characteristics. Do not atte mpt to handle liquid nitrogen until you read and fully understand the potential hazards, their conseque nces, and the related safety precautions. Maintenance: Keep the unit clean and dry at all times. Do not use strong alkaline or acid cleaner s that could damage the finish and corrode the metal shell. Handling Liquid Nitrogen Contact of liquid nitrogen or any very cold gas wi th the skin or eyes may cause serious freezing (frostbite) injury. Protect hands at all times when worki ng with liquid nitrogen with Cryo Gloves. Handle liquid nitrogen carefully The extremely low temperature can freeze human flesh very rapidly. When spilled on a surface the liquid tends to cover it completely and intimately, cooling a large area. The gas issuing from the liquid is also extremely cold. Delicate tissue, such as that of the eyes, can be damaged by an exposure to the cold gas which would be too brief to affect the skin of the hands or face. Never allow any unprotected part of your body to touch objects cooled by liquid nitrogen. Such objects may stick fast to the skin and tear th e flesh when you attempt to free yourself. Use tongs, preferably with insulated handles, to withdraw obj ects immersed in the liquid, and handle the object carefully. Wear protective clothing Protect your eyes with a f ace shield or safety goggles (safety gl asses without side shields do not give adequate protection). Always wear cryo gloves when handling anything that is, or may have been, in immediate contact with liquid nitrog en. The gloves should fit loosely, so that they can be thrown off quickly if liquid should splash into them. When handling liquid in open cont ainers, it is advisable to wear high-top shoes. Trousers (which shou ld be cuffless if possible) shoul d be worn outside the shoes. Any kind of canvas shoes should be avoided because a liquid nitrogen spill can be taken up by the canvas resulting in a far more severe burn, in fact that woul d occur if the feet were e ssentially open or bare! Now we don't advocate going bare foot when using liquid ni trogen, but we also don't th ink that the wearing of canvas shoes is a safe practice either. 129 APPENDIX M - SAFE HANDLING OF LIQUID NITROGEN Use only liquid nitrogen in liquid ni trogen dewars.

Now we don't advocate going bare foot when using liquid ni trogen, but we also don't th ink that the wearing of canvas shoes is a safe practice either. 130 APPENDIX M - Safe Handling of Liquid Nitrogen (Cont'd.) Use only containers designed for low-temperature liquids Cryogenic containers are specifically designed and made of materials that can withstand the rapid changes and extreme temperature differences encountered in working with liq uid nitrogen. Even these special containers should be filled slowly to minimize the internal stresses that occur when any material is cooled. Excessive internal stresses can damage the container. Do not ever cover or plug the en trance opening of any liquid nitrogen dewar. Do not use any stopper or other device that would interf ere with venting of gas. These cryogenic liquid containers ar e generally designed to operate with little or no internal pressure. Inadequate venting can result in ex cessive gas pressure which could da mage or burst the container. Use only the loose-fitting necktube core supplied or one of the approved acc essories for closing the necktube. Check the unit periodically to be sure that venting is not restricted by accum ulated ice or frost. Use proper transfer equipment Use a phase separator or special f illing funnel to prevent splashing a nd spilling when transferring liquid nitrogen into or from a dewar. The top of the funne l should be partly covered to reduce splashing. Use only small, easily handled dewars for pouring liquid. For the larger, heavier c ontainers, use a cryogenic liquid withdrawal device to transfer liquid from one c ontainer to another. Be sure to follow instructions supplied with the withdrawal device. When liquid cylinde rs or other large storage containers are used for filling, follow the instructions supplied with those units and their accessories. Do not overfill containers Filling above the bottom of the necktube (or specified maximum level) can result in overflow and spillage of liquid when the necktube core or cover is placed in the opening. Never use hollow rods or tubes as dipsticks When a warm tube is inserted into liquid nitrogen, liquid will spout from the botto m of the tube due to gasification and rapid expansion of liquid inside the tube. Woode n or solid metal dipsticks are recommended; avoid using plastics that may become very brittle at cryogenic temperatures which then become prone to shatter like a fragile piece of glass. Nitrogen gas can cause suffocation without warnin g. Store and use liquid nitrogen only in a well ventilated place. As the liquid evaporates, the resultin g gas tends to displace the normal ai r from the area. In closed areas, excessive amounts of nitrogen gas reduce the concentration of oxygen and can result in asphyxiation. Because nitrogen gas is colorless, odorless and tasteless, it cannot be detected by the human senses and will be breathed as if it were air. Breathing an atmosphere that cont ains less than 19 percent oxygen can cause dizziness and quickly result in unconsciousness and death. Note: The cloudy vapor that appears when li quid nitrogen is exposed to the ai r is condensed moisture, not the gas itself. The gas actually causing the condensa tion and freezing is completely invisible. Never dispose of liquid nitrogen in confined areas or places where others may enter. 131 APPENDIX M - Safe Handling of Liquid Nitrogen (Cont'd.) First Aid Notice If a person seems to become dizzy or loses conscious ness while working with liquid nitrogen, move to a well-ventilated area immediately. If breathing has stopped, apply artific ial respiration. If breathing is difficult, give oxygen. Call a physici an. Keep warm and at rest. If exposed to liquid or cold gas, restore tissue to normal body temperature 98.6\u00b0 F (37\u00b0C) as rapidly as possible, followed by protection of the injured tissu e from further damage a nd infection. Remove or loosen clothing that may constrict blood circulation to the frozen area. Call a physician. Rapid warming of the affected part is best achiev ed by using water at 108\u00b0F/42\u00b0C). Unde r no circumstances should the water be over 112\u00b0F/44\u00b0C, nor should the frozen part be r ubbed either before or afte r rewarming. The patient should neither smoke, nor drink alcohol. Most liquid nitrogen burns are really bad cases of frostbite. We don't mean to belittle the harm that can come from frostbite, but at the same time, we wanted to keep the dangers associated with liquid nitrogen burns in perspective. Indeed , liquid nitrogen burns could be treated as frostbite. Handling Liquid Nitrogen Dewars Keep unit upright at all times ex cept when pouring liquid from dewars specifically designed for that purpose. Tipping the container or layi ng it on its side can cause spillage of li quid nitrogen. It may also damage the container and any materials stored in it. If tipping is anticipated, be su re to purchase a dewar that can be outfitted with a tipping stand. Rough handling can cause serious damage to dewars. Dropping the container, allowing it to fall over on its side, or subjecting it to sharp impact or severe vibration can result in partial or complete loss of vacuum. To protect the vacuum insulation system, handle containers carefully. Do not \"walk\", roll or drag these units ac ross a floor. Use a dolly or handcart when moving containers, especially the larger de wars. Large units are heavy enough to cause personal injury or damage to equipment if proper li fting and handling techni ques are not used. When transporting a liquid nitrogen dewar, main tain adequate ventilation and protect the unit from damage. Do not place these units in closed vehicles where the nitrogen gas that is continuously vented from unit can accumulate. Prevent spillage of li quids and damage to unit by securi ng it in the upright position so that it cannot be tipped over. Protec t the unit from sever jolting and impact that could cause damage, especially to the vacuum seal. Keep the unit clean and dry Do not store it in wet, dirty areas. Moisture, animal waste, chemicals, strong cleaning agents and other substances which could promote corro sion should be removed promptly. Use water or mild detergent for cleaning and dry the surface thoroughly. Do not use str ong alkaline or acid cleaners that could damage the finish and corrode the metal shell. Protect Dewar Contents Materials stored in a liquid nitr ogen dewar with a wide mouth ar e protected by the extremely low temperature of the liquid nitrogen or the gas that issues from the eva porating liquid nitrogen. When all of the liquid nitrogen has evaporated, the temperature inside the unit will rise slowly to ambient. The rate at which the liquid nitrogen will evaporate depends upon the pattern of container use and the age and condition of the container. Evaporation increases as in sulation efficiency deteri orates with age and rough handling. Opening and closing to insert and remove materials and moving the unit will also increase the evaporation rate. 132 APPENDIX N- Universal Waste Disposal Policy and Guidelines plus Electronics Recycling 6 NYCRR Subpart 374-3 from the NYS Department of Environmental C onservations sets the Standards for Universal Wastes. The University at Albany inco rporates these standards into their Universal Waste Disposal Policy and Guidelines. Subpart 374-3 establishes requirements for managing Batteries, Pesticides, Thermostats and Lamps as Universal Waste as described in subdivision 374-3.1. BATTERIES: All used or unwanted batteries generated at the Univers ity at Albany must be disposed as either universal waste or hazardous waste. Spent lead-acid batterie s not handled as hazardous waste, must go out as universal waste. Vendors supplying l ead-acid batteries to the University at Albany shall be required to remove and dispose of these batteries when discarde d by the University at Alba ny as universal waste in accordance with Subpart 374-3 and state contract requir ements. Anyone disposing of lead-acid batteries through the state contracts must keep on file all signed shipping papers for at least three y ears. All other types of batteries, such as alkaline, nickel cadmium , nickel iron, nickel meta l hydride, carbon zinc, zinc air, mercuric oxide, button cells, silver oxide, zi nc carbon (mercury-containing), mercury, alkaline (mercury-containing), lithium metal, ion and ma gnesium, lead-acid and sealed lead -acid (non- automotive), are all considered to be universal wast es when discarded and to be handled in accordance with Subpart 374-3. Batteries should be sorted by t ype for disposal. The Offi ce of Environmental Health and Safety is responsible for coordinating the disposal of universal waste at the University at Albany. Contact the Office of Environmenta l Health and Safety at 442-3495 in Chemistry B73, if you have any questions about battery dispos al, if you need waste batter y containers or if you have batteries that need to be discarded. Please use the link below to locate battery recycli ng locations on campus. http://www.albany.edu/ehs/pdf/Battery %20Recycling%20Locations%20-%202011.pdf PESTICIDES: All discarded or recalled pesticides at the University at Albany are to be handled as either universal waste or hazardous waste, depending on the pesticide. The Office of Environmental Health and Safety coordinates the disposal of discar ded or recalled pesticides and must be contacted at 442-3495 in Chemistry B73, whenever pesticides are ready for di sposal or when a pesticide has been recalled as defined in Subpart 374-3. MERCURY THERMOSTATS: All discarded mercury thermo stats must be handled as either unive rsal waste or hazardous waste at the University at Albany. The Office of Environmental Health and Safety at 442-3495 in Chemistry B73 will coordinate the disposal of any merc ury thermostats generated at the Un iversity at Albany. Mercury 133 APPENDIX N- Universal Waste Disposal Policy and Guidelines plus Electronics Recycling - (Cont'd.) thermometers are disposed of as hazardous waste th rough the EH&S Office. The EH&S Office will swap out, at no charge, any mercury-cont aining thermometers for non-mercury containing ones. Please contact the office in advance, to arrange a swap out. LAMPS: All lamps/bulbs, excluding incandescent, are to be handl ed as either universal or hazardous waste at the University at Albany, due to their mercury content. This includes all fluorescent lamps (including U- shaped, circular and compact), High Intensity Disc harge (HID), metal halide, mercury-containing bulbs from instruments, such as microscopes (HBO short ar c lamps), etc. The Office of Environmental Health and Safety coordinates the disposal of all discarded lamps (except in candescent) at the University at Albany. The Environmental Health and Safety Office (EH&S) must be contacted at 442-3495 in Chemistry B73 for proper packaging instructions and turnover to EH&S . It is important to prevent breakage of any lamp/bulb prior to dis posal, in order to not release minor amounts of mercury into the air. COMPUTER MONITORS AND ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS/EQUIPMENT: Though not technically considered universal waste, computer monitors and electronic components/equipment may contain heavy metals, such as lead, that are hazar dous to the environment when disposed of incorrectly. The University at Albany recycles all computer monitors and electronic components/equipment, once Equipment Management has declared it as surplus equipment. Contact the EH&S Office at 442-3495 in Chemis try B73 for more information. 134 APPENDIX O - APHIS/CDC SELECT AG ENTS AND TOXINS LIST (from the National Select Agency Registry) Select Agents and Toxins List The following biological agents and toxins have been determined to have the potential to pose a severe threat to both human and animal health, to plant hea lth, or to animal and plant products.

HF's uni que properties make it significantly more hazardous than many of the other acids used on campus. This appendix discusses how to protect yourself against the dangers of HF. Attached you'll also find emergency procedures for dealing with HF exposures. Please post these procedures wherever HF is used or handled. The health hazards of HF are dependent upon the type of e xposure and the concentration. Eye and skin exposure HF is corrosive and readily destr oys tissue. Exposure of the eyes to HF may result in blindness or permanent eye damage. HF readily penetrates human skin , allowing it to destroy soft tissues and decalcify bone. Chemical burns from HF are typically very painful and slow to heal. Skin exposure to high concentrated HF (approximately 50% or great er) immediately results in serious and painful destruction of tissue. Not only can skin contact cause burns, but sy stemic fluoride poisoning may also result. One of HF's most insidious properties is that skin contact at lower c oncentrations may not produce pain or burning sensations until hours after the exposure. Because of the ability of HF to produce severe delayed tissue damage without necessarily producing pain, all skin, eye, or tissue contact with HF should receive immediate first aid and medical evalua tion, even if the injury appears minor or no pain is felt. Inhalation of HF vapor Inhaling HF vapors can seriously damage the lungs . Delayed reactions up to and including fatal pulmonary edema (flooding of the lu ngs with body fluids) may not be ap parent for hours after the initial exposure. OSHA limits employees' exposure to airborne co ncentrations of HF to an average of 3 parts per million (ppm) over an 8-hour work day. Airborne con centrations of 10 to 15 ppm will irritate the eyes, skin, and respiratory tract. Thirty ppm is consider ed immediately dangerous to life and health and may have irreversible health effects. At airborne conc entrations above 50 ppm, even brief exposure may be fatal. Chronic HF exposure Long-term or chronic exposure to HF may result in fluorosis, a syndrome char acterized by weight loss, bone embrittlement, anemia, and general ill health. 137 INFORMATION AND TRAINING Employee Information and Training HF is a colorless liquid with a st rong irritating odor at low concen trations (3 ppm). Employees who handle HF must receive documented training on the h azards of HF and what to do in the event of an exposure or a spill by their supervisor or Principal I nvestigator. A Material Safe ty Data Sheet (MSDS) on HF should always be kept in the immediate work ar ea where HF is used. The MSDS, together with this appendix, is an excellent basis for training empl oyees on the hazards of HF. EHS is available for providing assistance with training upon request. ENGINEERING CONTROLS AND PERSONAL PROTECTION Ventilation HF should be used with adequate ve ntilation to minimize inhalation of vapor. Concentrations greater than 5% should always be handled insi de a properly functioning chemical fume hood. The chemical fume hood needs to have a current calibration sticker (wit hin 1 year). Call OH&S (X5-4312) if the hood you are using has not been calib rated within 1 year. Eye Protection Always use chemical splash goggles together with a face shield when handling concentrated HF. Due to HF's highly corrosive nature, safety glasses with side shields do not provide adequate eye protection. Body Protection Wear a laboratory coat w ith a chemical splash apron made out of natural rubber, neoprene, or viton. Never wear shorts or open-toed shoes when handling HF or other corrosive chemicals. Gloves Typically, medium or heavyweight v iton, nitrile, or natural rubber gl oves are worn when working with HF. Always consult the manufacture r's glove selection guide when sele cting a glove for HF. If you have any questions about which glove to choose, contact EH S at 2-3495. A second pair of nitrile exam gloves should be worn under the gloves for protection against leaks. Gloves that have not been contaminated with HF may be disposed of in the common trash. If gloves become contaminated with HF, remove them immediately, thoroughly wash your hands, and check your hands for any sign of contamination. Contaminated gloves must be disposed of as HF waste . 138 Mild HF burn to thigh from comm ercial rust stain remover. FIRST AID AND EMERGENCY PROCED URES (also refer to MSDS) Eyewash and Shower Since HF is corrosive and rapidly damages tissue, an eyewash and shower must be nearby and accessible. Eye exposure: Immediately irrigate eyes at eyewash for at least 15 minutes with copious qua ntities of water keeping eyelids apart and away from eyeballs. Do not apply calcium gluconate gel to eyes. In all cases of eye exposure, seek prompt medical attention. Skin Exposure: Immediately wash affected area of skin at sink if a small area of hand or forearm has been contaminated or at a drench shower if upper arms, torso, or legs are contaminated. If calcium gluconate gel is readily available, limit rinsing to 5 minutes so that application can be quickly initiated to limit the migration of the fluoride ion. Reapply and massa ge calcium gluconate gel into affected area of skin every 15 minutes. If calcium gluconate gel is not available rinse skin for a minimum of 15 minutes. Remove all contaminated clothing and place in hood or plastic bag. In all cases of skin exposure, seek prompt medical attention. Ingestion: Drink large amounts of water to dilute. Do not induce vomiting. Several glasses of milk or several ounces of milk of magnesia may be given fo r their soothing effect. In all cases of ingestion, seek prompt medical attention. Inhalation: Move victim to fresh air. In all cases of overexposur e through inhalation, seek prompt medical attention. Calcium Gluconate Gel Calcium gluconate gel is a topical antidote for HF skin exposure. Calcium gluconate works by combining with HF to form insoluble calcium fluoride, thus preventing the extraction of calcium from tissues and bones. Keep calcium gluconate gel nearby whenever you're working with HF. Calcium gluconate can be ordered through Life Safety Associates www.lifesafety.com or Fisher Scientific , plus other vendors. Calcium gluconate has a limited shelf life and should be stored in a refrigerator, if possible and replaced with a fresh supply after its expira tion date has passed. Use disposable nitrile gloves to apply calcium gluconate gel . Even after applying calcium gluconate, it is essential that a me dical evaluation be made. 139 Note: Exposure to HF requires immediate and special ized first aid and medical treatment. Delays in first aid care or medical treatment will likely result in greater damage or may, in some cases, result in a fatal outcome. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS FOR HA NDLING AND STORAGE OF HF Safe Work Practices If possible, avoid working alone when you're using HF . Do not eat, smoke, or dr ink where HF is handled, since the chemical can be swallowed. Wash hands thoroughly after handling HF. HF Spills If HF is spilled outside a chemical hood, evacuate the area, close the doors, post th e area with a sign to prevent others from entering, and call for assistan ce. Refer to section in plan on chemical spill procedures. Small spills of HF insi de a chemical fume hood can be cleane d up by laboratory staff, if they have received spill cleanup training, have the co rrect equipment, understand the hazards, and are confident in their abi lity to clean up the spill safely and dispose of the waste properly as hazardous waste. Lime soda, ash, sodium bicarbonate, or a spill absorbent specified for HF should be used for cleanup. Contact EHS for free HF spill kits. Organic spill kits that contain Floor-Dri, kitty litter, or sand should not be used because HF reacts with sili ca to produce silicon tetrafluoride, a toxic gas. Storage Store all HF and HF waste in labeled chemically co mpatible containers (e.g., polyethylene or Teflon). Glass, metal, and ceramic containers are not compa tible with HF. HF should never be stored with incompatible chemicals such as ammonia or other al kaline materials. Always pl ace HF on a low protected shelf or other location where it will no t be accidentally spilled or knocked over. Waste HF waste should be placed in a chemically compatible container with a sealed lid and clearly labeled. Complete a Hazardous Waste Labe l and call EHS at 2-3495 for a wa ste pickup or if you have any questions regarding the di sposal of HF waste. Hazards Associated with Other Fluorine Compounds Many chemicals containing fluorine, such as ammonium fluoride, sodium fluoride, sulfur tetrafluoride, and ammonium bifluoride, may react with acid or wate r to produce HF. Review the MSDS of all fluoride compounds carefully for safety precautions to reduce th e risk of creating a HF hazard. If the manner in which the fluorine compound is used can create HF, follow the precautions for HF and keep topical antidote on hand. Questions?
