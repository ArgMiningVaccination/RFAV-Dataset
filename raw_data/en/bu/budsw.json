The course format includes lectures, a unique virtual question and answer process, networking opportunities, focused track sessions and experiential morning programs.

It focuses on the whole person: mind, body, and spirit, with a strong emphasis on the physician-patient partnership. Integrative holistic medicine is based on the following principles: Health is more than the absence of disease. A person is more than their symptoms, and healing requires a whole person approach. Empowered patients make long-term and lasting changes that support healing and optimal health. Research has demonstr ated that nearly one in three Americans seek out complementary and alternative medicine to supplement conventional care. Patients are asking their physicians about the medical value of these therapies. Since these approaches have not become routinely incorporated into most health professional school curricula, health care providers are seeking trusted sources for learning about these techniques. The course was created with these needs in mind, and sets reasonable standards for the application of integrative holistic medicine. The course is valued for its evidence based, clinically relevant focus, and is appropriate for seasoned integrative practitioners as well as newcomers to the field.t r a v e l i n f o r m a t i o n Research abstracts of original work dealing with integrative holistic medicine will be accepted in three categories: I. Original Clinical Resear ch II. Basic Sciences / Review / Case Studies III.
