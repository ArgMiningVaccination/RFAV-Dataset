All COVID-19 vaccines are free from metals. None of the vaccines contain eggs, gelatin, latex, or preservatives. mRna vaccines work by copying material from the virus that causes COVID-19 to give our cells instructions to make a harmless protein unique to the virus. The urgency of the pandemic created greater access to research funding, reduced obstacles and encouraged government and industry cooperation. Scientists built upon previous work on coronavirus vaccines and mRNA vaccine technology to develop these new vaccines quickly and effectively. The FDA has issued full approval for the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Full FDA approval requires data on safety, manufacturing, and effectiveness over long periods of time and includes real-world data. Side effects to the COVID-19 vaccines are typically mild \u2014 soreness in the arm, fatigue, headaches, or a slight fever \u2014 and subside within 1-2 days. The risk of serious reaction or dying is rare. Not enough is yet known about how long immunity from natural COVID-19 illness might last, and evidence is emerging that vaccination provides protection even in people who have had COVID-19.VARIANTS COVID-19 vaccines are extremely effective in protecting fully vaccinated people from catching and spreading the virus and its variants. CHILDREN Vaccinating your child against COVID-19 helps stop the spread of the disease to others and protects them against serious side effects from the COVID-19 virus itself. Children may experience mild side effects, such as soreness in the arm, fatigue, headache, or a slight fever, and most will pass in one to two days. Serious side effects are rare and treatable. PREGNANCY Obstetricians, Gynecologists and other leading maternal health organizations strongly recommend the COVID-19 vaccine for all people who are pregnant, chest-feeding or trying to get pregnant now or in the future. There is no evidence to show that getting a COVID-10 vaccine increases the risk of miscarriage or fertility problems . In fact, COVID-19 vaccines protects against higher risk of serious illness for you and your baby. QUARANTINE VS ISOLATION Quarantine and stay away from others when you have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19. Isolate when you are sick or when you have COVID-19, even if you don't have symptoms. Quarantine and Isolation guidelines. You can end quarantine when you test negative for COVID-19 or 5 full days after a positive test. You can end isolation after 5 full days if you are fever-free for 24 hoursCOVID-19 Vaccine Communication Resources Based on recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 3313_5/13/22The official guidance from the CDC is to get your COVID-19 initial, second, and booster doses as soon as you're done quarantining, or when you finish your isolation period and your symptoms have improved. A person is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving all recommended doses in their primary series of COVID-19 vaccine. While COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, no vaccine provides 100% immunity. Because this is a new virus, scientists and medical experts continue to monitor how long immunity lasts, whether some groups may need additional doses, and how well the vaccines protect against new variants of the virus. The CDC recommends that everyone ages 5+ get vaccinated, and ages 12+ get a COVID-19 booster dose. COVID-19 vaccines are free from metals and manufactured electromagnetic products. The vaccines do not contain microchips, nor will they make you magnetic. COVID-19 vaccines do not create or cause variants of the COVID virus. New variants of a virus happen because the virus constantly changes through a natural ongoing process of mutation. In fact, high vaccination coverage in a population reduces the spread of the virus and helps prevent new variants from emerging. COVID-19 vaccines cannot change your DNA, nor can you get COVID-19 from the vaccine. mRNA does not contain the live COVID virus, and it never enters the part of the cell where our genetic material is located, so it cannot infect us, or change our genes.Mythbusters OTHER RESOURCES Finger Lakes Covid-19 Vaccine Hub https://flvaccinehub.org/ Finger Lakes Rural Immunization Initiative Toolkit and Social Media "}
