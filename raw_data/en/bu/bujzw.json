Without a brain, you might look good, but all you could do is run for public office.\" - Covert Bailey In Just the Fats Ma'am, you learned what a healthy fat looks like, how to cook safely with different fats, and why fats are good for the body. Certain fats, such as omega-3 fatty acids, are not only vital for health but can only be obtained through diet. That's why they are also called Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs). While there are actually 11 different types of omega-3's, the three most important types are: Alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA) found in plants Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) found in marine life Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) found in marine life Since the body cannot make omega-3's on its own, adding certain foods to your weekly menu can optimize health in a tasty new way! Food Sources of Omega-3 Fatty Acids The following foods are the best sources for omega-3's: Albacore tuna Algae Anchovies Chia seeds Cod Liver Oil Flaxseed and flaxseed oil Halibut Herring Krill oil Lake trout Mackerel Organic Soybeans Oysters, Mussels, Clams Pumpkin seeds and pumpkin seed oil Salmon Sardines Spinach Walnuts and walnut oil Winter Squash Benefits of Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids are highly concentrated in the brain and play a critical role in brain function, particularly memory, performance, mood and behavioral functions. Three key areas of brain function that require omega-3's are brain development, mental health and reducing risk of dementia. Brain Development Omega-3 fatty acids appear to be important for neurological development in infants. \"In a study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in August 2013, children who consumed an omega-3 fat supplement as infants scored higher on rule learning, vocabulary, and intelligent testing at ages 3 to 5.\" In addition, children with lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids had more learning and behavioral problems (such as temper tantrums and sleep disturbances) than those with normal omega-3 fatty acid levels. Mental health Many studies have found decreased omega-3 levels in depressed patients. Although research is still inconclusive, there seems to be evidence that omega-3 fatty acids may play a role in depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Depression: Some research found that omega-3's in the diet help to reduce levels of depression. They also seem to increase the influence of antidepressants. Bipolar disorder: Omega-3's in addition to prescriptions seem to help people with bipolar disorder experience fewer mood swings and relapses. Schizophrenia: Preliminary clinical tests indicate people with schizophrenia who take omega-3 fatty acids experience an improvement in symptoms. Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia Several studies show that a lack of omega-3 fatty acids increases the risk of age-related dementia. Scientists believe increased levels of the omega-3 fatty acid DHA has a positive effect on memory loss related to aging, including for Alzheimer disease and dementia. Supplementing with Omega-3 Fatty Acids It's always best to get nutrients from whole food sources whenever possible. Using the food list above will be a great start to getting your omega-3's! As a general rule of thumb, try to consume fish at least twice per week and use the above oils for cooking - as long as you're staying within their safe smoke points. However, if you feel you need additional supplementation, speak with your physician, local nutraceutical expert and/or nutritionist to decide the best brand and dosage for you. Next up in the final installment of this series, you'll learn about the influence fats have on the body, good and bad. RESOURCES: "}
