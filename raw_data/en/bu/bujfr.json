We scrutinise public spending for Parliament and are independent of government and the civil service. We help Parliament hold government to account and we use our insights to help people who manage and govern public bodies improve public services. The Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG), Gareth Davies, is an Officer of the House of Commons and leads the NAO. We audit the financial accounts of departments and other public bodies. We also examine and report on the value for money of how public money has been spent. In 2021, the NAO's work led to a positive financial impact through reduced costs, improved service delivery, or other benefits to citizens, of \u00a3874 million.

It is responsible for health and adult social care policy in England, while responsibility for health and social care policy for the rest of the UK is devolved to the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is a ministerial department supported by 24 partner organisations. The largest of these, NHS England, oversees the operational management of the NHS in England. Adult social care is provided through a mixed economy of state, private sector and third sector bodies. It is funded partly by individuals paying for their own care and partly by local authorities. More information on our work on local government is available in our Departmental Overview of the Department for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities (November 2021).The Department of Health & Social Care has three main areas of responsibility. Overseeing the health and care framework: the Department is responsible for ensuring that the legislative, financial, administrative and policy frameworks are fit for purpose and work together. Setting direction : the Department is responsible for deciding and setting the future direction of health and social care policy in England, and for the UK's international work on health. Accountability: the Department oversees the delivery of health and adult social care and the work of its arm's-length bodies. It ensures that they deliver agreed plans and commitments. The Permanent Secretary is ultimately accountable to Parliament for all the funds spent by the Department and its arm's-length bodies. The Department may from time to time intervene in the day-to-day running of the system to resolve complex issues, for example regarding hospital mergers. quality and distinctive output and services.In its Outcome Delivery Plan for 2021 to 2022 (July 2021) the Department set out five priority outcomes. These are to: protect the public's health through the health and social care system's response to COVID-19; improve healthcare outcomes by providing high-quality and sustainable care at the right time in the right place and by improving infrastructure and transforming technology; improve healthcare outcomes through a well-supported workforce; improve, protect and level up the nation's health, including reducing health disparities; and improve social care outcomes through an affordable, high-quality and sustainable adult social care system.

During 2020-21, the Department spent \u00a3193.4 billion, the vast majority of which was spent through its arm's-length bodies and other parts of the health sector. The largest recipient of Departmental funding was NHS England and, through it, NHS providers including hospital trusts. NHS England funded hospital services, primary care and medicine costs both directly and via Clinical Commissioning Groups. The Department also passed funding worth \u00a36.5 billion to local authorities, both directly and via Public Health England. This does not include any funding local authorities received through the Better Care Fund, administered by NHS England. The resource expenditure shown in this diagram includes the Department's additional expenditure due to the of Health & Social Care pandemic. This is covered in more detail on the next page. Not visible in the diagram is the capital spending of the Department and its bodies, which amounted to an additional \u00a312.7 billion during 2020-21, mainly spent on projects such as new equipment and the construction of new hospitals. \u00a33.4bn \u00a33.1bnLocal authorities, \u00a36.5bn Clinical Commissioning Groups, \u00a3102.5bn Dental and Ophthalmology, \u00a33.7bnNHS Trusts and NHS Foundation Trusts \u00a395.0bn GP Primary Care services, \u00a310.4bnPrescribing and Pharmaceuticals \u00a311.2bnNon-NHS bodies, \u00a318.4bn Other, \u00a37 .3bnCore Departmental \u00a329.5bn England, \u00a34.4bn Other, \u00a34.2bnUndergraduate training, \u00a30.9bnPostgraduate training, \u00a32.1bn Clinical education and training, \u00a30.7bn Other, \u00a30.7bnDepartment of Health & Social Care, \u00a3193.4bn Public Health England, \u00a35.4bn NHS England, \u00a3146.0bn Notes 1 T otals do not sum due to rounding. 2 Public Health England was replaced in October 2021 by UK Health Security Agency, and the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities, which is part of the Department.

Previously, the Department had passed the vast majority of its budget through to the NHS. But in 2020-21, it took direct responsibility for new areas of spending - particularly on the purchasing of increased PPE (personal protective equipment), the cost of COVID-19 testing and tracing and, from August 2021, vaccine -15 \u00a3 billionThe Depar tment 's capital ex penditure rose from billion in 2019-20 to \u00a312.68 billion in 2020-21 Source: National Audit Ofce analysis of Depar tment of Health & Social Care nancial statementsBudge ted Actual Principal new areas of spending in 2020-21 (resource and capital combined) The Department allocated \u00a323.1 billion to NHS Test and Trace, of which it spent \u00a313.5 billion. The PPE programme was allocated \u00a314.8 billion, with \u00a313.1 billion being spent on the procurement and supply of PPE. The NHS's COVID-19 response, including in-patient services, received an allocation of \u00a318.6 billion, of which it spent \u00a316.3 billion. There was a further \u00a33.6 billion of spending (against a budget of \u00a36.5 billion) on other COVID -related activities. Together these represented 24% of the Department's total spending in 2020-21. In addition, the Department received COVID-19 vaccines worth \u00a3594 million, which had originally been purchased by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy.Departmental Overview 2020-21 DHSCContents 8 Contents Overview Section Two The Department's activities in 2020-21 Financial management continued Qualification of accounts The Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) qualified his opinion on the Department's 2020-21 accounts. This means that the C&AG concluded that there was insufficient evidence relating to the Department's inventory, contract provisions and associated transactions. He also qualified his opinion because: \u00a31.3 billion of the Department's COVID-19 spending was spent either without the necessary HM Treasury approvals or in breach of conditions set by HM Treasury; and due to insufficient evidence to show that the Department's spending, particularly on COVID-19 procurement, was not subject to a material level of fraud.Financial management challenges The qualification and associated issues, as well as the ongoing consequences of the pandemic, represent a sizable financial management challenge for the Department. In particular: the Department had to establish quickly large commercial teams for the purposes of contract negotiation and management. These newly formed teams faced difficulties at times and now have responsibility for a large number of complex contracts; and it now owns and oversees a large inventory of PPE. The The Comptroller and Auditor General 's report on the Department 's Accounts (pages 190-205) detailed \u00a38.7 billion of impairments (write-downs because of a drop in the fair market value of an asset) to PPE in 2020-21. This included \u00a34.7 billion written down because the PPE was now worth less than the Department had paid for it, and \u00a32.6 billion written down for items unsuitable for use in the NHS but which may find uses elsewhere. In addition, the Department estimated a further \u00a31.2 billion reduction in the value of its PPE inventory in future due to PPE not delivered by 31 March 2021 but which the Department was still committed to purchase.Departmental Overview 2020-21 DHSCContents 9 Contents Overview Section Two The Department's activities in 2020-21 Staff and pay The Department's staff in 2020-21 Staff numbers and cost According to its most recent annual report and accounts , in 2020-21 the core Department employed on average 5,888 people on a full-time equivalent (FTE) basis. This represented a 233% increase in staffing levels since 2019-20, when it employed 1,770 people (FTE). Overall, some 1.4 million people (FTE) were employed within the group of bodies the Department oversees. Of these, 95% worked in the NHS, about which detailed staffing data are published on a monthly basis. The total cost of staff within the groups of bodies the Department oversees rose by 12%, from \u00a364.5 billion in 2019-20 to \u00a372.3 billion in 2020-21. Use of contractors The Department has made increased use of off-payroll, temporary and consultancy staff: In 2020-21, the core Department's spending on temporary staff was more than 36 times higher than in 2019-20: \u00a3542.0 million compared with \u00a314.8 million. Similarly, its spending on consultancy was more than 11 times higher: \u00a3171.6 million compared with \u00a315.2 million. The Department said in its annual report, \"these increases predominantly relate to the establishment of programme activity relating to the Department's COVID-19 response, much of which was stood up at pace and/or was temporary in nature\".The NHS's staff in England in January 2022 In January 2022, the NHS in England employed 1,370,991 individuals across its hospital and community services, equivalent to 1,220,469 on a FTE basis. This represented an 8.1% increase since January 2020, just before the pandemic, when 1,128,525 people (FTE) were employed. The increase since January 2021 was 3.5%, when 1,179,008 people (FTE) were employed. Among this workforce 52.9% (645,309 FTE people) were professionally clinically qualified. This included all doctors, qualified nurses and health visitors, midwives, qualified scientific, therapeutic and technical staff, and qualified ambulance staff. The proportion was broadly the same as in January 2021. Professionally qualified NHS staff in January 2022 included: 319,806 FTE nurses and health visitors - a 3.8% increase on a year earlier; 128,016 FTE doctors - a 3.4% increase on a year earlier; 157 ,245 FTE scientific, therapeutic and technical staff - a 3.1% increase on a year earlier; 22,172 FTE midwives - a 1.6% decrease on a year earlier; and 18,068 FTE ambulance staff - a 2.9% increase on a year earlier. In most cases the NHS does not directly employ GPs, although they are vital to the service it provides. In December 2021, there were 36,191 (FTE) GPs in England - a 2.8% increase on the number in December 2020.Departmental Overview 2020-21 DHSCContents 10 Contents Overview Section Two The Department's activities in 2020-21 Civil Service Annual People Survey The annual Civil Service People Survey looks at civil servants' attitudes to, and experience of, working in government departments. The results of the 2021 survey were published in April 2022. Results for the Department include the views of staff in the core Department and Public Health England/the UK Health Security Agency. These results have fallen in all areas since 2020, except for 'Resources and workload' where there was no change. The Department scored within five percentage points of the Civil Service Benchmark (the median score across all civil service organisations surveyed) in every area except one. On 'Organisational objective and purpose' the Department scored 12 percentage points lower than the benchmark.

It has been at the heart of the government's efforts to reduce the health impact of the disease with responsibilities including: implementing legislation including the Coronavirus Act (2020) and subsequent Protection Regulations to seek to limit the spread and manage the impact of COVID-19; procuring and distributing PPE, medicines and other pandemic supplies; supporting the development of vaccines (alongside the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy) and overseeing the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination programme; setting up the NHS Test and Trace service to provide mass testing and contact tracing; working with others in central government and with local government to support those deemed clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV); overseeing the continued provision of routine care, insofar as this proved possible, by NHS and social care providers; and reforming the national arrangements for public health by abolishing Public Health England, creating the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities, and merging the NHS Test and Trace service into UKHSA.The NAO published its first report on the Department's response to the pandemic on 12 June 2020, less than three months after the start of the first national lockdown. Since then, we have produced numerous reports to Parliament, using our statutory powers to provide transparency and assurance about how and how well the Department and its bodies have spent public money in response to the pandemic. The rest of this overview brings together our findings in three major areas: the impact of the Department's COVID-19 response on citizens; the impact of the pandemic on health and social care services to date; and the Department's procurement, and contract and financial management functions. We also draw out our observations about digital innovation and data and about the health and care workforce, two areas where the Department faces particular challenges in the immediate future. Finally, we provide an overview of the Health and Care Act 2022 , which received Royal Assent on 28 April. Among other provisions, the Act introduces Integrated Care Systems as statutory bodies. These provisions took effect on 1 July 2022.Departmental Overview 2020-21 DHSCContents 12 Contents Overview Section Three The Department's response to COVID-19 Overview: COVID-19, key dates and the Department's response 2020 2021 31 Jan 4 Jan 22 Feb 8 Mar 29 Mar 1 Apr 21 Mar 25 Mar 23 Mar 17 Apr 28 May 1 Jun 14 Aug 14-22 Sep 14 Oct 5 Nov 8 Dec 14 Dec 1/2Departmental Overview 2020-21 DHSCContents 13 Contents Overview Section Three The Department's response to COVID-19 Overview: COVID-19, key dates and the Department's response continued 2021 2022 17 Jan 27 Jan 24 Feb 1 Apr 21 Mar 4 Apr 12 Apr 19 Jul 14 Dec 14 Dec 7 May Jul-Sep 16 Sep 27 Nov 30 Nov 12 Apr 2/2Departmental Overview 2020-21 DHSCContents 14 Contents Overview Section Three The Department's response to COVID-19 The impact of the Department's COVID-19 response on citizens Vaccinations The development of effective COVID-19 vaccines at the end of 2020 marked a new stage for the pandemic. The UK was the first country in the world to approve and roll out a COVID-19 vaccine, with the first dose given in December 2020. We reported on The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme in England in February 2022. We concluded that the vaccine rollout had been value for money up to the end of October. Up to July 2021, the NHS achieved all its major deployment targets to offer vaccines to the population. By October 2021, 85% of eligible adults in England had received two doses of an approved vaccine. This was higher than NHS England's planning assumption that 75% of adults would take two doses. By the end of October 2021, the NHS and its partners had administered a total of 87 million doses in less than a year and the vaccine programme overall had spent \u00a35.6 billion. We also highlighted a number of risks to the continued success of the programme. In particular, despite efforts to address inequalities, the number of adults receiving two doses was comparatively low for younger age groups (see chart below), certain ethnic minority groups and for pregnant women, meaning that people in these groups were at higher risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19 than if they were vaccinated. 6468768187 vaccina tion up take for adults by age, deprivation and ethnicit y in England, as at 31 October 2021 Vaccination up take (two doses, %) Source: Comp troller and Audit General, The rollout of the CO VID-19 va ccina tion programme Audit Ofce, February 2022, Figure 21Uptake is lower for y ounger people, those in more depriv ed areas and some et hnic groups Age groupCOVID-19 v accination up take by age group, 31 Oc tober 2021Clinically Extremely Vulnerable citizens Early in the pandemic, the government identified a category of people who would be Clinically Extremely Vulnerable (CEV) to COVID-19 and who should therefore stay at home to shield themselves. On 9 March 2020, it started to develop a support package for them, which included food and medicine deliveries, basic care, and a contact centre for advice. On 22 March 2020, the government announced the start of shielding. Initially, central government took responsibility for the programme, including the supply of emergency bulk food deliveries, but over time local authorities gained more control. Those devising the programme at first assumed there would be around 1.5 million people but by 7 May 2020 there were 2.2 million people designated as CEV. The support package offered to CEV people had cost \u00a3308 million by August 2020. Our report on Protecting and supporting the clinically extremely vulnerable during lockdown (February 2021) found that many people had benefited from the programme and that it had been a \"swift government -wide response\" to protect those most at risk. However, some local authorities criticised the quality of early emergency bulk food supplies funded by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra). Separating the impact of shielding from other factors, such as the impact of general lockdown, is extremely difficult, and the Department of Health & Social Care was unable to say to what extent measures to support shielding had led to fewer deaths or less serious illness among CEV people. Departments involved in the first shielding effort had learned lessons before the second national lockdown in November 2020. The shielding programme was paused on 1 April 2021, and formally closed on 15 September 2021. 1/3Departmental Overview 2020-21 DHSCContents 15 Contents Overview Section Three The Department's response to COVID-19 2/3The impact of the Department's COVID-19 response on citizens continued People in receipt of social care Early in the pandemic many care homes experienced outbreaks of COVID-19 with many residents dying as a result. Our first report on the Department's response to the pandemic, Readying the NHS and adult social care in England for COVID-19 (June 2020), found that between 9 March and 17 May 2020, around 5,900 (38%) of care homes across England reported an outbreak. We also reported how, between 17 March and 15 April 2020, around 25,000 people were discharged from hospitals into care homes and that it was not known how many of them had COVID-19 at the point of discharge. Before the pandemic, social care provision was insufficient to meet need and there were many other problems with the system. Our report on The adult social care market in England (March 2021) found that the Department lacked a long-term vision for care despite high levels of unpaid care, too many adults with unmet care needs, and forecasts of growing demand. Subsequently, in the second half of 2021, the government announced plans to reform social care over the next few years, and the Department brought forward detailed proposals in a white paper, People at the Heart of Care: adult social care reform white paper (December 2021).Testing and contact tracing Tests for COVID-19 became available to anyone with symptoms from 18 May 2020, and on 28 May the government launched the NHS Test and Trace Service (NHST&T) to lead the national test and trace system, with its overall aim being to help break chains of COVID-19 transmission and enable people to return to a more normal way of life. We published audits of the progress of the Test and Trace service in December 2020 and in June 2021 . We found that it had quickly built up national testing capacity from a low base and set up a national contact tracing service from scratch. However, people still sometimes struggled to access tests, for example, in September 2020, when school and university terms started. NHS Test and Trace did not initially meet its target of providing people with their test results within 24 hours, although this later improved (see chart on page 16). We also found that NHST&T had done little to decipher whether differences in access to testing existed for vulnerable groups. It was hard to tell to what extent efforts to get positive cases and their contacts to isolate were working, even though this was central to the success of the service overall. In February 2021, NHST&T published research on its impact on the R number (the number of new infections from each person infected). This estimated that, in October 2020, the combination of testing, tracing and self-isolation resulted in a reduction in the R number of 18%-33%, with most of the reduction accounted for by self -isolation upon onset of symptoms by individuals, that is, before they had engaged with NHST&T. Our review highlighted a number of uncertainties in these estimates, including elements that could overstate the estimated contribution of NHST&T's activities. In 2020-21, the Test and Trace service spent \u00a313.5 billion. The majority of this, \u00a310.4 billion (77%), was spent on testing, with \u00a31.8 billion (13%) spent on 'contain' activities (for example, supporting local responses to the pandemic) and \u00a30.9 billion (7% of the total) on tracing activities.Departmental Overview 2020-21 DHSCContents 16 Contents Overview Section Three The Department's response to COVID-19 The impact of the Department's COVID-19 response on citizens continued Notes 1 Pillar 2 comprises tests processed by lighthouse and other public, private and academic laboratories primarily for the wider population, including care homes. The metric shown only covers in-person Pillar 2 tests, ie taken at a regional, local or mobile testing site. 2 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests look for the presence of the COVID-19 virus using a swab which is processed in a laboratory.

We found that between mid-March and mid-April 2020, the NHS increased bed capacity for COVID-19 patients in NHS trusts in England so that the total number of patients never exceeded the number of available beds. By the end of April 2020, government had allocated \u00a36.6 billion to support the health and social care response to COVID-19 and \u00a33.2 billion to local government to respond to COVID-19 pressures across local services. The impact of the pandemic on routine NHS services Our first report on NHS backlogs and waiting times in England (December 2021) showed how the NHS's performance in elective and cancer care had been deteriorating for a number of years before the pandemic, with service standards increasingly missed. However, our report also demonstrated how the pandemic and the NHS's response to it had created unprecedented additional challenges. The known waiting list for elective care grew by 1.4 million to almost six million patients between February 2020 and September 2021. Within that waiting list an increasing proportion of patients had been waiting for longer than 18 weeks (see graph opposite). The waiting list grew because NHS staff and facilities were redeployed to treat COVID-19 patients and to be ready to treat COVID-19 patients. It also grew because of enhanced infection control measures which slowed some processes, in turn putting some beds out of use along with staff sickness and absence due to self-isolation. In addition to the known waiting list, by September 2021, we estimated that there had been between 7.6 million and 9.1 million 'missing' referrals for elective care because of the NHS working differently and citizens avoiding GPs and hospitals. Many of these 'missing' patients will subsequently have to be dealt with as well.0.00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.61.82.02.2 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021COVID-19 pandemicThe number of patients waiting mo re than 18 week s, August 2007 to September 2021, monthly totals Patients w aiting more than 18 w eeks, millionsThe statutory requirement for 92% of patients on the w aiting list to star t treatment (or to be seen by a specialist and lea ve the waiting list) within 18 w eeks w as last me t in F ebruary 2016 Notes 1 The 8% do tted line sho ws the statutory limit f or pathways above 18 w eeks. 2 The ve rtical line f or the pandemic is placed at March 2020. 3 Figures f or August 200 7 - Sep tember 2008 based on monthly NHS statistics as initially published and do no t reflec t very minor subsequent revisions made to these statistics.

In September 2021, 51% of patients in Birmingham and Solihull were experiencing waits of more than 18 weeks, compared with 21% in South West London. In February 2022, the NHS published its Delivery plan for tackling the COVID-19 backlog of elective care . We intend to publish a second report on backlogs evaluating the Department's and the NHS's recovery plans and whether they are progressing towards their goal of restoring NHS services to the necessary standards.Percentage of patients on the waiting list waiting for more than 18 weeks, September 2021 Patients in some parts of England are much more likely to experience long waits for elective treatment than patients elsewhere Notes 1 In broad terms, 'elective care' means any non-emergency treatment under the care of consultants, for instance, hip and knee replacements. 2 Mapping at latest Offi ce for National Statistics health geography levels, 2021.

This has brought both successes and problems. The overall government approach to procurement during the pandemic On 18 March 2020, the Cabinet Office issued guidance on the public procurement rules which allow bodies to negotiate with any supplier without undergoing formal competition in emergency circumstances, reducing the time required to make purchases but resulting in greater risks to public money. The Department's pandemic procurements We published an Investigation into government procurement during the COVID-19 pandemic in November 2020, covering the crucial first few months of the pandemic response. We found that up to the end of July 2020, the Department was responsible for the vast majority of pandemic contracts awarded by value, some 90% of the total, or 7,477 contracts with a value of \u00a316.2 billion out of a total of 8,600 government contracts with a value of \u00a318.0 billion. As part of our work, we examined a sample of 20 contracts, 12 of which had been entered into by the Department or its arm's -length bodies. We found that: there was inadequate documentation in a number of cases relating to how the risks of procuring suppliers without competition had been mitigated; some contracts were awarded retrospectively after some work had already been carried out; and there was not always a clear audit trail to support key procurement decisions. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) COVID-19 had an extraordinary impact on global demand for, and supply of, PPE in 2020: as global demand soared, supply declined due to a fall in exports from China (the country that manufactures the most PPE). The result was a 'seller's market' with customers competing against each other, pushing up prices, and buying huge volumes of PPE, often from new suppliers. As part of its efforts to secure additional PPE, the Department established a high -priority lane (known as the VIP lane) in April 2020 to assess and process potential introductions to PPE suppliers and distributors by government officials, ministers' offices, MPs and members of the House of Lords, senior NHS staff and other health professionals. By January 2022, the Department had spent \u00a312.6 billion on PPE, against contracts worth \u00a313.1 billion. It had received 31.5 billion items of PPE in the UK, with a further 1.4 billion stored in China and five billion not yet received. Some 17.3 billion items had been distributed to the health and social care sectors, but the Department identified some 3.6 billion items - 11% of the PPE received - were not suitable for use by front -line services. The Department is incurring significant costs to store PPE. For further information, see The supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic (November 2020) and Investigation into the management of PPE contracts (March 2022). 1/3 We have done more detailed work on a number of specific areas of procurement as follows.Departmental Overview 2020-21 DHSCContents 20 Contents Overview Section Three The Department's response to COVID-19 Procurement and contracting continued Vaccines The government created the Vaccine Taskforce in April 2020 to secure COVID-19 vaccine supplies for the UK. The Taskforce was initially accountable to the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS), but from August 2021 responsibility for its procurement of vaccines transferred to the Department. The programme took early action to develop a portfolio of possible vaccines and sign contracts with manufacturers prior to regulatory approval, accepting that it might have to write off some money if vaccines were not approved. This approach paid off, with the UK securing early access to COVID-19 vaccines from December 2020. By the end of October 2021, the government had spent \u00a35.6 billion on the COVID-19 vaccine programme, including \u00a32.9 billion to purchase vaccines. Some 146 million doses had been supplied by the end of October 2021 and the average procurement cost per dose (including VAT) was \u00a315.02. We found that the programme's achievements up to October 2021, particularly in the unique circumstances of the pandemic, had provided value for money. However, we also noted that the UK could end up with vaccine surpluses in future with the consequent risk of increased vaccine wastage. For further information, see our Investigation into preparations for potential COVID-19 vaccines (December 2020) and our report on The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme in England (February 2022).NHS Test and Trace By mid-May 2020, tests for COVID-19 became available to anyone with symptoms. Later that month, the government launched the NHS Test and Trace Service (NHST&T) to supply tests, record results and carry out contact tracing as a means of breaking chains of virus transmission. In 2020-21, NHST&T spent \u00a313.5 billion. Of this, \u00a310.4 billion was spent on testing, including around \u00a33 billion on purchasing lateral flow tests. Overall, of the \u00a314 billion of contracts it let in 2020-21, \u00a37.5 billion (53%) were let directly under emergency regulations without competition. We found that in its contracts for contact tracing NHST&T struggled to match supply and demand. Utilisation rates for contact tracers were as low as 1% at some points in 2020 but improved after the service introduced more flexibility into contracts. In the period through to the middle of 2021, utilisation peaked at 49% in January 2021 and then averaged 25% between April and May 2021, against a target of 50%. For further information, see our interim report on NHS Test and Trace (December 2020) and our progress update (June 2021). (Since we published these reports, the audited financial statements for 2020-21 have become available. In some cases, there are small, non-significant differences between the numbers.) 2/3Departmental Overview 2020-21 DHSCContents 21 Contents Overview Section Three The Department's response to COVID-19 Procurement and contracting continued Randox We published an Investigation into government's contracts with Randox (March 2022). Concerns had been raised in Parliament about the transparency and management of contracts the government awarded to Randox Laboratories Ltd. The Department and its arm's-length body Public Health England awarded 22 contracts to Randox with a minimum value of \u00a3776.9 million between January and December 2020. By October 2021, the total amount paid out to Randox by the Department was \u00a3407.4 million. However, we found that the Department did not document key decisions adequately, particularly relating to how it moved through procurement stages. It had also not kept full records of a ministerial discussion that involved Randox. The gaps in the audit trail mean that it is not possible to provide positive assurance in the normal way, but we have not seen any evidence that the government's contracts with Randox were awarded improperly.Ventilators In early March 2020, the Department expected that in a reasonable worst-case scenario the NHS might need 90,000 ventilators. It then had around 7,400 at its disposal. From 13 March onwards, the government looked to acquire as many ventilators as it could, as quickly as possible. It took a two-pronged approach. The Department sought to buy extra ventilators from established suppliers, while the Cabinet Office set up a ventilator challenge, to encourage UK manufacturers to develop new ventilator models. Our report Investigation into how government increased the number of ventilators available to the NHS in response to COVID-19 found that the Department acquired 1,800 new ventilators before the mid-April 2020 peak of COVID-19 infections. The government as a whole was not able to meet the target of acquiring 18,000 mechanical ventilators by the end of April, but it did make progress towards the later target of 30,000 by the end of June. In the event, many of the new ventilators were not needed because clinical demand for ventilation was lower than forecast. At the time of our report, in September 2020, the Department estimated that it had spent \u00a3292 million (excluding VAT) on ventilators (excluding shipping costs and supporting devices). Its audited financial accounts for the whole of 2020-21 show that total spending on ventilators, including shipping costs and supporting devices, was more than \u00a3490 million. 3/3Departmental Overview 2020-21 DHSCContents 22 Contents Overview Section Four Ongoing challenges Section Four Ongoing challenges WorkforceOur report on NHS backlogs and waiting times in England (December 2021) showed that the UK had fewer health staff relative to the size of its population than many Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries (see figure below). This helps to explain why workforce shortages have become such a key area of concern in the NHS in recent years. The NHS Long Term Plan (January 2019) acknowledged that existing staff \"were feeling the strain ... partly because over the past decade workforce growth has not kept up with the increasing demands on the NHS\". The pandemic has exacerbated this situation by increasing the sense of strain in some parts of the workforce and by creating a large backlog of unmet demand for healthcare workers to deal with. Note: The resources include those in both the public and private healthcare sectors.

Source: OECD, Health at 23 Contents Overview Section Four Ongoing challenges Workforce continued The Delivery plan for tackling the COVID-19 backlog of elective care (February 2022) commits the NHS to \"increasing workforce capacity by identifying and addressing gaps across key staff groups and sectors\". However, we know from our past work that there are significant challenges to achieving this. Training - many healthcare roles require long periods of training, meaning that it takes many years for increases in student numbers to feed through to the front line; additionally, there can be financial and bureaucratic disincentives for potential students. Recruitment - international recruitment patterns are in flux following the UK's exit from the EU and other changes to immigration policy. Retention - difficulties and stress from the pandemic and other factors may result in more staff leaving the health and social care sector, while concerns about pay and benefits may increase in a period of higher inflation. In addition, the changing world of work means that more staff are now part-time and workforce planning must take account of this.Our report on The NHS nursing workforce (March 2020) highlighted how workforce challenges and strategies varied by NHS trust and region. For example, there were clear differences in vacancy rates, levels of overseas recruitment and the age profile of the nursing workforce. At the time of the report, the system was awaiting an already -delayed full, costed five-year national workforce plan. This has still not been published more than two years later. In July 2020, the Department published a document setting out some actions it planned to take in 2020 -21 while work continued to develop the longer -term approach. Our report on The adult social care market in England (March 2021) found that significant workforce challenges remained. We reported that: around 1.5 million people were working in the care sector; additionally, there was a significant level of unpaid care, provided by friends and family (the charity Carers UK estimated there were around 7.3 million carers in England, most of whom are unpaid family, friends and neighbours who provide care informally); and despite NAO and Committee of Public Accounts recommendations and a Departmental commitment in 2018, the Department had not yet published a new social care workforce strategy to replace the one issued in 2009. 2/2Departmental Overview 2020-21 DHSCContents 24 Contents Overview Section Four Ongoing challenges Digitising the NHS Progress in recent years NHS services are dependent on people and equipment. Increasingly in recent years the latter of these has included digital systems. Our report on Digital transformation in the NHS (May 2020) found that: the NHS and other Departmental bodies had ambitious plans for digital transformation but that the NHS's track record in this regard was poor; a previous commitment to create a 'paperless' NHS by 2018 had not been met; and local NHS organisations faced significant challenges in working towards digital transformation, including outdated IT systems that did not connect to other systems and competing demands for investment. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the NHS made significant changes to its digital services, some of which may now become permanent. NHS Digital has highlighted the extensive use by the public of the NHS website and NHS app, the implementation of digital services for COVID-19 testing, the collection of new datasets to support the pandemic response, and the value of the Summary Care Record for patients. In addition, there was a substantial increase in the number of virtual consultations (telephone or video) that GPs held with patients, although this increase has not been universally welcomed. Our report on The rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination programme in England (February 2022) found that NHS England and NHS Improvement (NHSE&I) and NHS Digital had \"created new digital tools to support the vaccine deployment, making effective use of imperfect existing data\".Looking to the future The Department has acknowledged the need to strengthen governance of digital transformation. The chair of NHS Digital completed a review of governance in November 2021 - Putting data, digital and tech at the heart of transforming the NHS . The review recommended a more coherent approach to digital transformation in NHS national bodies. Following this, NHSX, the unit which had led digital transformation for three years, became part of NHS England's Transformation Directorate, and the Department expects to merge NHS Digital into NHS England in 2023. In June 2022, the Department published Data saves lives: reshaping health and social care with data . This paper sets out how the Department intends to \"use data to bring benefits to all parts of health and social care - from patients and care users to staff on the frontline and pioneers driving the most cutting -edge research\". It includes 105 commitments from the Department to enable it to achieve its objectives, which are to: improve trust in the health and care system's use of data; give health and care professionals the information they need to provide the best possible care; improve data for adult social care; support local and national decision-makers with data; empower researchers with the data they need to develop life-changing treatments, diagnostics, models of care and insights; work with partners to develop innovations that improve health and care; and develop the right technical infrastructure.Departmental Overview 2020-21 DHSCContents 25 Contents Overview Section Four Ongoing challenges The Health and Care Act On 28 April 2022, the Health and Care Act received Royal Assent. It ushered in some of the biggest changes to the structure of the NHS in England for a decade. The main innovation is the introduction into statute of Integrated Care Boards and Integrated Care Partnerships, two key components of Integrated Care Systems. Integrated Care Systems (ICSs) ICSs have been operating on a non-statutory basis for a number of years. The Health and Care Act establishes the new structures on a legislative basis. ICB commissions services from, or delegates funding to, delivery structures at several different geographical levels. Geographical level Typical delivery structures System (1 million-2 million people)Provider Collaboratives (new partnerships operating across ICSs and which may involve voluntary and independent sectors). Place (250,000 to 500,000 people)Health and Wellbeing Boards, Place-based Partnerships (multi-agency partnerships involving NHS organisations, local authorities, and voluntary, community and social enterprise organisations). Neighbourhood (30,000 to 50,000 people)Primary Care Networks, bringing together general practice and other primary care services, such as general practice, opticians and dentists.Integrated Care System (ICS) Integrated Care Board (ICB) Members nominated by NHS Trusts, local authorities, GPs and others as determined by the ICB. Allocates NHS budgets and commissions services, having regard to the Integrated Care Strategy.Integrated Care Partnership (ICP) A statutory joint committee of the ICB, local authorities and other bodies as determined locally. Responsible for developing an Integrated Care Strategy for how the ICB and other partners can meet the health, public health and social care needs of the local population. The NAO has work under way looking at the introduction of ICSs.The Act makes other changes as well It establishes the Health Services Safety Investigations Body as a fully independent non-departmental public body that can investigate incidents that have implications for patient safety. It includes measures intended to support data-sharing between health and social care and to remove barriers in the hospital discharge process. It commits to looking at information-sharing in relation to safeguarding children. It introduces a duty on the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to review and assess the performance of local authorities' exercise of their regulated adult social care functions, and introduces powers for the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care to make direct payment to all providers, and to require providers to share data. It requires ICBs to set out what they propose to do to address the particular needs of victims of abuse and the particular needs of children and young persons under the age of 25. It gives the Secretary of State the power to introduce a licensing regime for non-surgical cosmetic procedures. It introduces a mandatory requirement for appropriate specialised training on learning disability and autism for all health and social care staff working in CQC-regulated settings. It bans virginity testing and hymenoplasty. 1/2Departmental Overview 2020-21 DHSCContents 26 Contents Overview Section Four Ongoing challenges The Health and Care Act continued Restructuring NHS England The Act allows the Department formally to merge a number of bodies into NHS England. Operationally, a number of bodies already work together as NHS England and NHS Improvement: the NHS Trusts Development Authority and Monitor came together to form NHS Improvement, which has been working jointly with NHS England since 2018. Using the enabling powers in the Health and Care Act, the Department expects to merge NHS Digital and Health Education England into NHS England in 2023. The NAO has undertaken lots of work on reorganisations of government bodies, including Reorganising central government (2010), a Short Guide: Reorganising arm's length bodies (2010) and A review of the role and costs of clinical commissioning groups "}
