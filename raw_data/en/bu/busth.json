SST improves acute symptoms, such as sneezing and rhinorrhea, as well as chronic symptoms, such as nasal obstruction, in patients with AR. However, its therapeutic mechanisms remain unknown. We examined the effects of SST and eight constituent crude drugs on phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced gene up-regulation of IL-33 and histamine H1 receptor (H1R), which are responsible for the pathogenesis of AR. We found that SST and its crude drugs, except for Pinellia tuber, significantly and dose-dependently suppressed PMA-induced both IL-33 and H1R mRNA up-regulation in vitro. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of the seven crude drugs to inhibit PMA-induced IL-33 mRNA up-regulation were correlated with those related to H1R mRNA up-regulation, suggesting that they act on a common signal molecule. These results suggest that SST improves nasal congestion that is induced by IL-33-related eosinophil infiltration and inhibits sneezing and rhinorrhea that are induced by H1R-mediated histamine signaling in the nasal mucosa of AR patients through its inhibition of a common molecule in the gene expression pathways of IL-33 and H1R. The results could explain the advantages of traditional herbal medicine, in which mixing various crude drugs not only acts on a common target to enhance its pharmacological action, similar to the effect of a high concentration of a single crude extract but also has the benefit of reducing the side effects of each crude drug.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-08-09", "cleaned_text": "Effects of Syo-seiryu-to and Its Constituent Crude Drugs on Phorbol Ester-Induced Up-Regulation IL-33 acute symptoms, such as sneezing and rhinorrhea, as well as chronic symptoms, such as nasal obstruction, in patients with AR. The anti-allergic activities of SST include inhibition of histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells [ [2](#B2-allergies-01-00015)], reduction of serum IgE levels in AR patients [ [3](#B3-allergies-01-00015), [4](#B4-allergies-01-00015)], modulation of Th1- and/or Th2-cytokines [ [5](#B5-allergies-01-00015), [6](#B6-allergies-01-00015), [7](#B7-allergies-01-00015)], and inhibition of airway eosinophil infiltration and blood eosinophil counts in mice [ [8](#B8-allergies-01-00015), [9](#B9-allergies-01-00015)]. Previously, we reported that SST suppressed nasal symptoms expression the nasal mucosa of AR model rats [ [10](#B10-allergies-01-00015)]. However, these pharmacological effects of SST reported are mainly for acute symptoms, and the underlying mechanisms for the chronic symptoms of SST remain to be elucidated. [11](#B11-allergies-01-00015), [12](#B12-allergies-01-00015)]. IL-33 is expressed basophils, and eosinophils. Since IL-33 stimulates these cells to produce Th2-cytokines, such as IL-5 and IL-13, it is suggested that IL-33 plays an important role in allergic reactions [ [13](#B13-allergies-01-00015), [14](#B14-allergies-01-00015), [15](#B15-allergies-01-00015), [16](#B16-allergies-01-00015), [17](#B17-allergies-01-00015)]. Recently, it was reported that levels of IL-33 in the blood and gene expression of IL-33 in the nasal mucosa of AR patients were elevated compared to those in healthy participants [ [18](#B18-allergies-01-00015), [19](#B19-allergies-01-00015)]. Therefore, it is suggested that IL-33 up-regulation is involved in the development of AR [ [20](#B20-allergies-01-00015), [21](#B21-allergies-01-00015)]. [22](#B22-allergies-01-00015)]. Levels of H1R mRNA have been reported to be up-regulated in the nasal mucosa of patients with AR [ [23](#B23-allergies-01-00015), [24](#B24-allergies-01-00015)]. In our previous study, we found that histamine increased the expression of H1R mRNA in HeLa cells [ [25](#B25-allergies-01-00015), [26](#B26-allergies-01-00015)] and that the gene expression levels of H1R in the nasal mucosa were correlated with the severity of nasal symptoms in AR patients [ [27](#B27-allergies-01-00015), [28](#B28-allergies-01-00015)]. Taken together, these results suggest that IL-33 and H1R gene up-regulation in the nasal mucosa leads to the exacerbation of nasal symptoms in patients with AR. [29](#B29-allergies-01-00015)] and H1R mRNA in HeLa cells [ [25](#B25-allergies-01-00015)]. Since SST is composed of eight crude drugs, we then examined whether each constituent crude drug of SST suppresses PMA-induced IL-33 and H1R mRNA up-regulation.

The IC50 values Asiasarum peony correlated with related to (r = 0.964, p < 0.01; [Figure 4](#allergies-01-00015-f004)). These results suggest that the active compound in each crude drug acts on a common signal molecule involved in the pathways of IL-33 and H1R gene expression. 3.4. Effects of Inhibitors of the H1R Gene Expression Signaling Pathway on PMA-Induced IL-33 Gene of MEK inhibition, that PKC, Hsp90, MEK, and ERK, which are involved in H1R gene expression signaling, are also involved in the IL-33 gene expression signal pathway. 4. Discussion [31](#B31-allergies-01-00015)]. Therefore, HeLa cells are one of the candidates responsible for histamine-induced H1R gene up-regulation, because they are derived from cervical cancer cells arising in epithelial cells. We demonstrated that histamine/PMA stimulation up-regulated H1R gene expression and the PKC/ERK signaling pathway was involved in this gene up-regulation [ [25](#B25-allergies-01-00015), [26](#B26-allergies-01-00015)]. The involvement of PKC/ERK signaling in nasal epithelial cells was also reported [ [32](#B32-allergies-01-00015), [33](#B33-allergies-01-00015)]. From these results, it is considered that HeLa cells can be used for the mechanistic studies of H1R gene up-regulation. This is the reason why we used HeLa cells in this study although they are not representative of typical target cells involved in allergic reactions. It was reported that IL-33 was expressed in epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts [ [34](#B34-allergies-01-00015)]. Therefore, HeLa cells can be used for the investigation of IL-33 gene expression signaling. Indeed, IL-33 gene up-regulation was induced by PMA stimulation (data not shown). However, we have demonstrated that the expression level of IL-33 mRNA did not relate to that of H1R mRNA in the nasal mucosa of AR patients (29). Thus, it is likely that IL-33-expressing cells are different from the H1R-expressing cells. This is the reason why we used Swiss3T3 cells but not HeLa cells for the IL-33 study. We have shown that activation of the gene expression signaling pathways for H1R and IL-33 gene followed by the elevation of their mRNA levels are responsible for the pathogenesis of AR [ [27](#B27-allergies-01-00015), [28](#B28-allergies-01-00015)]. However, changes in mRNA levels are often not reflected at protein levels. We have reported that histamine or PMA stimulation increased H1R at both mRNA and protein levels in HeLa cells [ [25](#B25-allergies-01-00015)]. However, we have no data demonstrating the correlation between IL-33 mRNA level and IL-33 protein level. Further studies are required and are under investigation in our laboratory. [13](#B13-allergies-01-00015), [35](#B35-allergies-01-00015)]. We previously showed that the expression level of nasal mucosal IL-33 mRNA was correlated positively with the number of blood eosinophils in patients who suffered from Japanese cedar pollinosis [ [29](#B29-allergies-01-00015)]. Moreover, Haenuki et al. reported that the infiltration of eosinophils in the nasal mucosa induced by ragweed pollen stimulation was suppressed in IL-33-deficient sensitized mice [ [19](#B19-allergies-01-00015)]. Since we previously reported suppressed IL-5 mRNA up-regulation in the nasal mucosa of AR model these results suggest that SST suppresses of eosinophil infiltration mucosa. Since eosinophil infiltration in the nasal mucosa is associated with nasal congestion symptoms [ [22](#B22-allergies-01-00015)], it is further suggested that SST inhibits eosinophil infiltration in the nasal mucosa to improve nasal obstruction in patients with AR [ [3](#B3-allergies-01-00015)]. [27](#B27-allergies-01-00015)]. We reported that SST suppressed nasal mucosal H1R mRNA up-regulation as well as in AR model rats [ [10](#B10-allergies-01-00015)]. Since IgE-mediated histamine release from mast cells in response to the specific allergens stimulates H1R on nasal trigeminal nerve endings to cause nasal symptoms in AR patients [ [22](#B22-allergies-01-00015)], it is suggested that SST suppresses nasal mucosal H1R gene up-regulation to inhibit sneezing and watery rhinorrhea in patients with AR [ [3](#B3-allergies-01-00015)]. All these findings suggest that SST not only inhibits sneezing and rhinorrhea induced by histamine signaling in the acute phase reaction with its ability to inhibit the nasal mucosal H1R gene up-regulation but also improves nasal mucosal swelling induced by eosinophil infiltration in the chronic phase reaction with its ability to inhibit the nasal mucosal IL-33 gene up-regulation in AR patients. SST is composed of eight crude drugs, Ephedra herb, cinnamon bark, processed Ginger, fruit, Glycyrrhiza, and crude drugs, PMA-induced both IL-33 and H1R mRNA up-regulation. As SST and its crude drugs target signaling molecules responsible for IL-33 or H1R gene expression signaling pathways, it is speculated that SST and its crude drugs suppress the basal mRNA level of these genes. In [Figure 1](#allergies-01-00015-f001)A, SST (4.09 mg/mL) showed mRNA level below the control level, suggesting the suppression of basal mRNA expression. In crude drugs, Ephedra herb, cinnamon bark, processed ginger, peony root, Schisandra and/or H1R mRNA expression below the control level (data not shown), suggesting these crude drugs also suppress the basal mRNA expression. We think that Asiasarum root also suppresses basal mRNA expression because 3 crude drug suppressed PMA-induced up-regulation of IL-33 mRNA expression to the control level (1.17 \u00b1 0.098 fold of the control) although we have no experimental data using over 3 mg/mL of extract from Asiasarum root. H1R and IL-33 genes were allergic-diseases sensitive genes and keeping these gene expression levels low are effective for improving nasal symptoms. In this context, this \"inverse agonist-like activity\" of SST and its crude drugs is very important to suppress basal mRNA levels of IL-33 and H1R. [24](#B24-allergies-01-00015), [25](#B25-allergies-01-00015)]. Studies using inhibitors of the H1R gene expression signaling pathway suggest that PKC, Hsp90, MEK, and ERK, which are involved in H1R gene expression signaling, are also involved in the up-regulation of IL-33 gene expression signaling. Thus, it is suggested that the suppressive effect of SST and its seven crude drugs was through the inhibition of common signaling molecules involved in both IL-33 and H1R gene up-regulation. All these findings suggest that SST was combined with seven multiple crude drugs with a strategy of mixing their common effects of the suppression of both IL-33 and H1R gene expression, thus leading to additive anti-allergic actions with fewer side effects. According to the data in [Table 1](#allergies-01-00015-t001), it seems that much higher concentrations of SST are needed to inhibit PMA-induced upregulation of IL-33 and H1R when compared to the individual crude drugs, especially Ephedra herb and cinnamon bark. As the proportion of 8 crude drugs in SST are Ephedra herb (11%), of SST contains approximately 0.25 mg each of Ephedra herb, Cinnamon bark. These amounts were the in same order of IC50 values of these crude drugs, suggesting that the contribution of these crude drugs to the suppressive effect of SST is high. Since the IC50 values of other crude drugs are large, it is considered that the contribution of these crude drugs to the suppressive effect of SST is low. In addition, since the hot water extract of the crude drugs contains many compounds that positively or negatively affect IL-33 and H1R gene expression, it is considered that the sum of these complex effects shows the suppressive effect of SST. From these facts, it is difficult to simply compare the suppressive effects of SST and crude drugs using only IC50 values. [36](#B36-allergies-01-00015), [37](#B37-allergies-01-00015)]. Pinellia tuber, the remaining crude drug of SST, did not affect the IL-33 and H1R gene up-regulation. However, it is possible that Pinellia tuber has other anti-allergic actions, because it was reported to suppress Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4, -5, and -13, as well as eosinophil infiltration, IgE, and histamine in the airway [ [38](#B38-allergies-01-00015)]. 5.
