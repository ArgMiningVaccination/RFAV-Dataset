These systems have their own philosophy, oriental methodologies and practices with some similarities. As the traditional systems of medicine are gaining popularity globally, the dissemination of knowledge is required for scientific understanding among physicians/researchers of other systems of medicines and scientists of allied sciences. The National Population Policy 2000, National Health Policy 2002, National Health Policy 2017 and the National Commission on Macroeconomic and Health-2005 of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, emphasized on reorientation and prioritization of research in Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) and to validate therapy and drugs for mainstreaming through integration and co-location. The Research Councils functioning under Ministry of AYUSH were set up to undertake research in AYUSH systems through their own institutes as well as in collaboration with reputed institutes involving scientists of different disciplines. These AYUSH Research Councils have contributed significantly in AYUSH research and it is the need of hour that these systems integrate among themselves to showcase the strengths of these individual systems for further planning and mainstreaming of AYUSH. Several scientific studies have been carried out to generate evidence on feasibility of integration of AYUSH with conventional system of medicine and have demonstrative benefits of this integrative approach in managing non communicable diseases and reproductive child health care. To showcase the notable achievements of AYUSH Research Councils and possible areas of collaboration, this document \"AYUSH systems -A focus on core achievements and potential areas of strength has been prepared to draw a future roadmap for integration among these systems. This document will demonstrate the common research activities of AYUSH Research Councils, to evolve strategic research programme on identified areas and to prepare a common strategy for popularity and utilization AYUSH system at large. i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll INDEX Chapter Content Page No Section I: Ayurveda 1-42 1 Background 3 1.1 Introduction 3 1.2 Brief on CCRAS 11 2 Core Achievements of CCRAS since inception 21 3.

According to Indian philosophy, health is prerequisite to pursue materialistic, social and spiritual upliftment of human being. It is believed that Lord Brahma, the creator of the universe was also the first preacher of Ayurveda. Four Vedas, considered as oldest Indian literatures composed between 5000 and 1000 BC have information on treatment by plants and natural procedures. Reference of medicine and surgery are also found in Indian epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata. Ayurveda was established as a fully grown medical system from the period of Samhita (compendium) i.e. around 1000 BC. Ayurveda literally means \"the knowledge of life\". In Sanskrit, the word Ayurveda consists of the words ayu, meaning \"life\" and veda, meaning \"knowledge\" or \"science\". Therefore, Ayurveda is an ancient and comprehensive system of health care originated in India. Ayurveda considers health of an individual as dynamic integration of body, mind, senses and soul. Ayurveda lays great emphasis on preservation and promotion of health and prevention of the occurrence of disease(s) through natural means. Besides, it advocates holistic approach to understand all aspects of human life, healthy living including diagnosis and management of disease. The compendia like Caraka Samhita and Susruta Samhita were written in a systematic manner with eight specialties during this period. In these treatises, the basic tenets and therapeutic techniques of Ayurveda got very much organized and enunciated. These treatises stressed the importance of maintenance of health and also expanded their vision to pharmaco-therapeutics. The therapeutic properties of plants, animal products and metals/minerals were extensively described in these compendia, which has made Ayurveda a comprehensive system of health care. An analysis of Ayurvedic treatises signifies that the different aspects of Ayurveda were evolved and documented from time to time in the form of texts or compendia. For instance the Caraka Samhita an authentic source of internal medicine emphasizes on philosophy of life and line of treatment for different diseases. Susruta Samhita added a complete systematic approach to surgery and diseases of eyes, ear, throat, nose, head and dentistry. Madhava Nidana, authored by Madhavakara is a work on diagnosis of the diseases. Bhava Prakasa written by Bhava Misra gives additional emphasis on medicinal plants and diet. Samgadhara Samhita focused on pharmaceutics and Ayurveda was enriched with addition of more formulations and dosage forms. Subsequently, texts of Ayurveda were commented upon, updated and methodically written by many authors from time to time. A look into commentaries on the treatises by the scholars indicates that while the theoretical framework of Ayurveda remained more or less the same, the knowledge about drugs and techniques of therapy got expanded. The old concepts and descriptions were reviewed and updated in the light of contemporary understanding by the commentators in their commentaries thus reviving Ayurveda into an applied form. Present form of Ayurveda is the outcome of continued scientific inputs that has gone into the evolution of its principles, theories and practices.1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI 3 AYUSH SYSTEMS I l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l 1.1.1 Fundamental principles Like any other system of medicine, Ayurveda is based on its fundamental principles such as Pancamahabhuta, Tridosha, Saptadhatu, Mala, Srotas, Agni, Oja, Prakriti, etc. Optimal health conceived in Ayurveda is a perfect harmony of body, mind and soul. Health or \"svasthya'ls a state of equilibrium of the Josafregulatory physiological entities), agra'(digestive and metabolic factors), function of dhatu (structural entities), ma/a(excretory entities) along with proper functioning of jnanendiya(seme organs,), manas(c heerful mind) and atma(soul). Any disturbance in this equilibrium due to internal or external factor leads to diseases. Ayurveda emphasizes that /Vafotf(psychosomatic constitution), which is specific to every individual, is responsible for the health or disease pattern in the individual. Human mind has trigunaiihrQQ attributes) i.e. sattva {pure state of mind), ra/as(mind with passion/desire/ attachment) and tama (inert/ignorant mind), which interact with the biological components, vata, pitta and kapha determine the psycho-somatic constitution of an individual. Ayurvedic approach to examination of psychosomatic constitution is important in assessing individual's health for planning preventive measures for selecting diet, medicine or treatment regimen. i. Pancamahabhuta (five basic elements)- The Universe according to Ayurveda iscomposed of five basic elements called Pancamahabhuta viz. akasa (basic ethereal element),vayu (basic air element),agni (basic element), jala (basic aqueous element) and prithvi (basic earthelement) and so is the humanbody. There is a fundamental similarity between universe and man. A harmonious interaction between the microcosm (humanbeing) and the macrocosm (universe) is the basis of health. ii. Tridosa (Three Regulatory Physiological Entities)- The doctrine of Panchamahabhuta is the origin and basis of the three regulatory physiological entities i.e. vata, pitta and kapha. Vata is derived from the basic element vayu and akasa, pitta from agni and kapha from jala and prithvi. The important function of vata is to impart movement, generation and conduction of impulses, transportation of biological materials and elimination of waste products. In the normal condition, vata performs entire neurological functions of the body. Vata is responsible for functioning of five sensory organs (Panca jnanendriya) and motor functions also. It is a regulator of psychosomatic functions of the living body. All the basic emotions like worry, anxiety, fear, grief, anger etc. are governed by vata. Usually all functions of nervous system at central and peripheral level are correlated with vata. Pitta represents transformation. It governs digestion, absorption, assimilation, nutrition, metabolism, body temperature, skin coloration, luster of the eyes, intelligence, and understanding. Psychologically, pitta arouses anger, hate, and jealousy. Usually digestive juices, enzymes and hormones come under this entity. Kapha is responsible for the physical strength, built, stability of structures, cooling, adhesion, lubrication, maintenance of the smooth working of the joints etc. It also exhibits psychological phenomena such as courage, forbearance, zest, virility, knowledge, understanding etc. These tridosa are described as the main cause fo r health and disease. The health is maintained i f they remain in balanced state and i f they are deranged in any manner, they vitiate structural and excretory entities to cause vikara/rogaf&ease/ AYUSH SYSTEMS ill. Saptadhatu (Seven Structural Entities) The structural elements in the body are classified as dhatu. They are seven in numbers and are responsible for maintaining the body in a compact and composed state. They are rasa (primary product of digested food), rakta( blood), /na/m, a(muscle tissue), medas(adipose tissue), asthi(bone tissue), majja(bone marrow) and sw&ra(reproductive elements). Apart from this, there are seven upadhatu (supportive by products of dhatu), namely stanya(breast are the three gross excretory entities. The exudates eliminated from eyes, nose, mouth, ears and reproductive organs and other structural entities etc. are also considered as Mala. Proper elimination of these excretory entities is also required to maintain health. Their hypo, hyper and irregular state results in diseases. v. Srotas (Micro and Macro Channels) The concept of srotas occupies an important position in the development of conceptual frame work of Ayurveda. According to Ayurveda whole body is made up of srotas( micro and macro channels), which transport all types of materials in the body. For normal functioning of the body, it is essential that these channels, both micro and macro remain intact. vi. Agni (Digestive and metabolic factors) The digestive and metabolic energy that is responsible for transformation of food to nutrients is called agni.It is responsible for digestion and metabolism in the body. In other words, agni signifies life process responsible for entire digestion, endocrine and metabolic activities. vii. Ojas (Essence of dhatu) Ayurvedic texts have vividly described the factor of immunity in terms of vyadhiksamatva, which is considered as the natural or acquired biological defense of an individual against diseases. This power is attributed to the presence of a biological factor called 0/as;the essence of the structural entities (dhatu), which literally means vigor. Ayurveda also describes a number of methods to promote ojasand vyadhiksamatva. viii. Prakrti (Psychosomatic Constitution) The structural and functional variations are the fundamental characteristics of human being. No two individuals are exactly alike either in their morphological, physiological or behavioral dimensions. The every individual differ in their genetic makeup and also in morphological and psychological aspects including their endocrine activity and metabolic efficiency. Ayurveda has given maximum attention regarding the clinical significance of individual personality and also recognized the dichotomy between mind and body and classified psychological personality in terms of sattvika, rajasika and tamasika where as somatic constitution is determined by relative predominance of vata, pitta and kapham an individual. Ayurvedic concept of Prakrtipariksa is to know body- mind constitution to predict the susceptibility of disease. Prakrti is considered while prescribing diet, medicine or treatment regimen to an individual, ix. Roga-Rogi Pariksa (Clinical diagnosis) The diagnosis in Ayurveda is based on two-fold approach viz.( 1) examination of the patient i.e., rogiI INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI 5 AYUSH SYSTEMS Pariksha and (2) diagnosis of the disease i.e. roga pariksa. The rogi pariksa is essentially concerned with ascertaining the psychosomatic constitution and status of health & vitality of the individual. This is achieved through ten fold examination (dasavidha pariksa ), eight fold examination (astasthana pariksa) and three fold examination (trividha pariksa) of the patient. For the proper treatment of diseases, it is mandatory to understand the exact nature of the disease with reference to dosa, dhatu, mala and agni. The diagnosis of the disease is also done with the help of saikriyakala (six stages of pathogenesis) and nidana pancaka (five fold approaches of diagnosis). x. Cikitsa Siddhant (Principles of Management) The approach of Ayurveda is holistic and individualistic. The promotive and preventive aspect of Ayurveda is called svasthavrtta that includes personal and social hygiene, regular daily and seasonal regime and appropriate social behaviour. The curative treatment consists of three major constituents, ahara (food), vihara (lifestyle) and ausadha (drug/medicament). Ideal treatment according to Ayurveda is one which cures the disease without causing adverse effect. Three classical therapeutic streams advocated by Ayurveda are (1) daivavyapasraya cikitsa (spiritual therapy) (2) yuktivyapasraya cikitsa (rational treatment) and (3) satvavajaya cikitsa (psycho-behavioral therapy). The Ayurvedic treatment methods can be grossly divided into three methods samsodhanaQa io- cleansing therapy), samsamana (palliative therapy) causative factors). Samsodhana is the modality by which effort is made to remove disease causing factors like metabolic wastes/toxins from the body. This is practiced through one or more therapies from pancakarma. Samsamana is the modality of treatment by which the disease causing factors are pacified inside the body and this is achieved through three types of therapies viz. food, lifestyle and medicine. 1.1.3 Strength of Ayurveda i. Comprehensive definition of health: Ayurveda defines health as a state of equilibrium of dosa (regulatory and functional entities of the body), dhatu (structural entities), mala (excretory entities) and agni (digestive and metabolic factors) alongwith healthy state of sensory and motor organs and mind with their harmonious relationship with the soul. As against definition of health, the diseased state is defined in Ayurveda as a loss of equilibrium of essential body constituents. The objective of disease management is to bring back the equilibrium, principally through lifestyle management rather than through curative therapies. The strength of Ayurveda lies in its three fold holistic approach of prevention of disease, promotion of health and cure of disease. This is achieved through care of body, mind and soul where physical, mental and spiritual aspects of health are considered. ii. Acceptance by the community: About 80-90% of population in India is reported to use Ayurveda and other traditional systems of medicine to meet their primary health care needs. Safety of this system is attributed to time-tested use substantiated by scientific evidences. Besides, synergy of ingredients in conjunction with individual need based treatment plan forms the basis of efficacy and safety of Ayurvedic formulations. Specific guidelines are prescribed for the use of apparently toxic medicinal plants with certain detoxification processing that also enhance the bioavailability and efficacy of the final product.I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I 6 AYUSH SYSTEMS I l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l iii. Emphasis on promotion of health and prevention of diseases: Considering health of an individual as dynamic integration of environment, body, mind and soul, Ayurveda lays great emphasis on preservation and promotion of health and preventing the occurrence of diseases. The treatment modalities of Ayurveda are based on the inherent ability of the living body to rejuvenate, regenerate and restore the natural equilibrium. While treating the patient, Ayurvedic treatment helps to enhance the natural healing process in the body.The prevention of disease and promotion of health is achieved by judicious practice of dinacarya (daily regimen), rtucarya (seasonal regimen) and sadvritta (ethical code of conduct) in accordance with prakrti (psychosomatic constitution). In this way significance of healthy life style for maintenance of health is emphasized by Ayurveda. Do's and don'ts on personal and social behavior are elaborated for attaining total health. Great emphasis is given on Nidana parivatjana i.e. keeping away from factors which cause or precipitate the disease, whereas therapeutic procedures like pancakarma help in eradicating the disease. iv. Importance of diet and lifestyle: The ultimate aim of this medical science is preservation of health and it can be attained in two ways, i.e. observation of lifestyle recommendations to prevent the diseases and eradication of already afflicted diseases. The prerequisites to attain the prevention include wholesome diet, conservation of environment, congenial social and cultural atmosphere. Diet is an essential factor for the maintenance of health. Ayurveda emphasizes on diversified aspects of dietetics and nutrition v t. quality, quantity, processing methods, rationale of combination of food articles, emotional aspects, nature of the consumer, geographical and environmental conditions etc. Advocacy of proper diet and life style, which is congenial to the individual, maintains normal body functions thus prevents the diseases. v. Holistic concept of health: Ayurveda considers a living being as a combination of body, mind and soul. All health management approaches are intended to maintain the harmony and homeostasis of these entities. vi. Individualized approach: Ayurveda considers that each individual has distinct psychosomatic constitution and health status. This is taken into account while advocating preventive, promotive and curative measures. vii. Universal approach: According to Ayurveda, the individual (microcosm) is a miniature replica of the universe (macrocosm). Every aspect of the universe is represented in the individual. Any change in the environment affects human being. Therefore, emphasis is laid on social and environmental factors which are interlinked with health. viii. Stress on public health and eugenics: The activities of the individual through his thought, word and deed have their good or bad effects on the environment. Ayurveda emphasizes upon healthy body, sound mind, benevolent speech and spiritual practices to create a healthy and happy environment. The pivotal role of eugenics mentioned in Ayurveda is to produce strong, healthy and ideal progeny. ix. Use of natural products: Ayurvedic products are derived mainly from plants and other natural resources. Supportive leads are emerging from revalidation of Ayurvedic drugs. Identification of active principles of some plants has led to discovery of many allopathic drugs. Some pharmacologically proven constituents of the etc. are used globally. AYUSH SYSTEMS I l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l x. Areas of clinical strength: Ayurveda provides healthcare within the physical and financial reach of rural India. Some of the Ayurvedic medicinal plants and spices are widely used as home remedies in India for a wide range of common ailments. The common users of Ayurveda are individuals suffering from chronic intractable diseases. Ayurvedic treatment is effective in chronic disorders like diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity; psychosomatic disorders like depression, insomnia; digestive disorders like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), peptic ulcer, respiratory disorders like bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; musculo-skeletal disorders like arthritis, osteoporosis; neurological and neuro-degenerative disorders like paralytic conditions, sciatica, etc. xi. Unique therapeutic approach: Ayurveda advocates certain bio-cleansing and rejuvenating therapeutic measures such as pancakarma, rasayana for maintenance of healthy state as well as in the management of chronic diseases. Ksarasutra, a minimal invasive para- surgical procedure using medicated thread, widely cited in ancient medical literatures for its safety and efficacy is being successfully practiced as promising therapy for ano-rectal disorders. Such unique specialties of Ayurveda either as stand alone or add on therapies are proven to have an edge over conventional medical approach in disease management and improving quality of life. 1.1.4 INFRASTRUCTURE AND REGULATORY STRUCTURE A well-developed infrastructure of AYUSH systems exists in India which includes educational institutes, research organizations, public and private hospitals, dispensaries and registered private practitioners providing health care. At administrative level there is Ministry of AYUSH under Government of India, and there are separate Directorates of AYUSH in different States. Through culturally and socially interwoven network with the community, AYUSH systems have very deep roots in the India's health care delivery. About 80-90% of population in India is reported to use Ayurveda and other traditional systems of medicine to meet their primary health care needs. As on 2011 the health care services are being extended to the masses through a huge network of registered Ayurveda practitioners, Ayurveda hospitals, dispensaries, under graduate (UG) and post graduate (PG) colleges (includes exclusive PG colleges and UG colleges those run both PG and UG courses). This infrastructure includes both public and private sector. About 8000 licensed drug manufacturing units produce classical and proprietary Ayurvedic medicines.

(1) pratyaksa (direct perception), (2) anumana (inference), (3) aptopadesa (authoritative and documentary testimony), (4) yukti (reasoning) Presently the research in Ayurveda is conducted through multi-disciplinary approach. The drug development phase includes selection of research area on the basis of national priority and literature, growing and collection of authentic raw materials by using good practices, standardization, safety/ toxicity studies, targeted biological activities, phased clinical trials. The research proposal has to be .approved by ethics committee and undergoes a scrutiny of scientific and monitoring committees, which includes experts from Ayurveda, Allopathy, Biostatistics, Pharmacology etc. Besides the infrastructure under the Ministry of AYUSH and Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, the research in this sector is being undertaken by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Department of Science and Technology, Department of Biotechnology, various Universities, Medical Colleges, AYUSH Colleges, Non Government Organizations (NGOs), Hospitals, Pharmaceutical Industry etc. Global Scenario In spite of advances in biomedical research and development, many new diseases are emerging. Prevention and management of chronic, non-communicable diseases are posing a global challenge. Previously, communicable diseases were accounted for more incidents of death globally, whereas in the present scenario chronic and lifestyle disorders and their complications have been the cause of mortality and morbidity. These diseases need long-term treatment just for palliative care, which involves major economic liability on the individual and the country. Another serious issue is safety of synthetic medicines related to long-term use. A resurgence of interest in Ayurveda has resulted from the preference of many consumers for products of natural origin.The Ayurvedic preventive and health promotive approaches and therapeutic modalities either stand alone or as add on1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI 9 AYUSH SYSTEMS I l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l therapies have an edge over the conventional medical approach in dealing with chronic and refractory disease conditions and life style related diseases. Ayurveda can offer solution in the management and improvement of quality of life in chronic diseases such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, bronchial asthma, skin allergies, eczema, psoriasis, liver paraplegia, mal-absorption syndromes, ischemic heart disease, epilepsy and generalized anxiety disorder. Initiatives Sensing the resurgence of global interest in Ayurveda, the Government of India has taken many initiatives for promotion and propagation of Ayurveda. Some of such initiatives are enlisted below: i. International exchange of experts and officers. ii. Incentive to drug manufacturers, entrepreneurs, AYUSH institutions etc. for international propagation of AYUSH and registration of their products by USFDA/EMEA/UK-MHRA for exports. iii. Support for international market development and AYUSH promotion-related activities. iv. Promotion of Ayurveda, Unani and Yoga abroad through young Post Graduates. v. Translation and publication of AYUSH literatures in foreign languages. vi. Establishment of AYUSH information cells/health centres in Indian embassies/missions and in the cultural centres set up by Indian council for cultural relations (ICCR) in foreign countries and deputation of experts. vii. International fellowship programme for foreign nationals for undertaking AYUSH courses in premier institutions in India.

Clinical Research The Council undertakes validation of classical Ayurvedic formulations already in the healthcare system through clinical studies to generate evidence on clinical efficacy and safety and scientific validation of new combinations (coded drugs) under drug development. The classical Ayurvedic formulations are already in the healthcare system and coded Ayurvedic drugs are made available into the healthcare system through systematic process of drug development viz. drug standardization and quality control, preclinical safety/toxicity studies and biological activity studies (as appropriate) and clinical trials as per requirement. The details are as under: I. Validation of classical Ayurvedic formulations for clinical efficacy and safety The Council has undertaken validation of classical Ayurveda formulations for identified disease conditions referring to Ayurveda classics, Ayurvedic pharmacopeia /Ayurvedic Formulary of India, Essential Drug list of ASU medicines (2013), Ministry of AYUSH. These formulations are being validated through Council's institutes engaged in clinical research in a phased manner. Some of the formulations are clinically validated for different disease conditions and some are used in different combinations for the same or different disease conditions. > Generated scientific evidence on safety and efficacy of approximately 100 classical Ayurvedic formulationson 36 diseases/conditions viz. Allergic Conjunctivitis, Dry Syndrome,Bronchial Asthma, Chronic Bronchitis, Cognitive Deficit, Dyslipidemia, Type II Diabetes Mellitus, Essential Hypertension, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Duodenal Ulcer, Jaundice, Diarrhoea, Fistula-in- ano, Iron Deficiency Filariasis, Obesity, Psoriasis, Gout, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, Hemorrhoids, Malaria, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Mental Retardation, Epilepsy, Schizophrenia, Refractory errors, Urolithiasis, and Heart disease.

In RAIFR, Pune, 159 species of medicinal plants were maintained; out of which 12 species are least concerned and 1 species is vulnerable. In RARI, Itanagar, 126 plant species of medicinal plants were maintained; out of which 4 species under cultivation are critically endangered, 6 species least concerned, 2 vulnerable and threatened. In RARI, Ranikhet, 119 plant species of medicinal plants were maintained; out of which 8 species under cultivation are rare, 4 species critically endangered and vulnerable. Saffron ( Crocus sativus L.) is successfully cultivated in the Institute (RARI, Ranikhet) gardens situated at Ranikhet and Chamma. Under development of agro techniques of medicinal plants, 30 protocols were prepared for conservation of these highly valued medicinal plants act as specimen fo r referencing and correct identification o f the medicinal plants. Experimental application o f agro techniques and adaptable practices are carried out to study the growth ofcorms andplants, yield o f saffron, etc. These gardens work as reference centers fo r researchers/students/academicians fo r identification o f their plants/plant parts, and the genuine materials collected from the gardens are used as a reference materialfor herbarium and museums. Further, under plant tissue culture 7 plants species is under pipeline In vitro cultivation of Bilwa (Aegle marmelos (L.) Corr.) AYUSH SYSTEMS Under pharmacognosy research, the council has taken up Pharmacognostical studies on 312 plants at 3 laboratories of CCRAS.The outcome of the Pharmacognostical studies has been documented in 3 Volumes of Book entitled Pharmacognosy of Indigenous Drugs(Vol 1-3) 3. Drug Standardization: Standardization is an essential step to ensure the quality of Ayurvedic drugs. Exploration of Ayuvedic drugs for chemical studies and quality assessment was initiated in the form of Chemical Research Studies and Standardization Studies with an approach plan to lay down analytical values and to identify the presence or otherwise of main ingredients in the preparation. Confirmation of identity, quality, purity, and detection of adulterants are the major objectives of standardization. One of the prime activities of the Council is Quality assessment of the single drugs and compound formulations and their method of preparation (standard operating procedures) through its Drug Standardization units. Initially, the Drug Standardization Units were Chemistry departments of reputed Institutes and Colleges viz. National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), Poona (Now Pune); University College of Sciences, Osmania, University, Hyderabad; Delhi University, Delhi; University of Kerala, Trivandrum; University College of Science, Calcutta and Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi in 1969 while three Preliminary Standardization Units- 1. Capt. Srinivasamurathy Research Institute, Madras; 2. Department of Modem Pharmacy, Gujarat Ayurvedic University, Jamnagar; 3. Department of Dravyaguna, Institute of Medical Science Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi in 1970. In view of the application of Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, as amended in 1964 it has been decided that preliminary standards are to be worked out for formulations as well as the ingredients (single drugs) for entering into the official pharmacopoeia. All this work was published as Pharamcopoeial Standards for Ayurvedic Formulations. This book consists of 431 formulations divided in 21 categories of dosage forms. Since inception , the following activities were carried out: > 2520 samples of single drugs. > 1369 samples of the formulation/finished products has been standardized > 356 samples were considered for analytical standardization. > 512 samples of 392 Ayurvedic plants for chemical studies > Shelf-life studies of 20 formulations. > HPTLC/TLC studies of 256 drug samples. At present, council has Drug standardization units viz. Captain Srinivasa Murthy Regional Ayurveda Drug Development Institute(CSMRADDI), Chennai (NABL accredited lab); Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Drug Development (CARIDD), Kolkata; Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Respiratory Disorders(CARIRD), Patiala; Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Drug Development(RARIDD), Gwalior and National Ayurveda Research Institute for Panchakarma, (NARIP)Cheruthuruthy etc.I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I AYUSH SYSTEMS 26 Under Drug Development Programme, the Council has developed various formulationsvz'z. Ayush 64, 82. Besides,Council has coordinated Reproductive and Child Health Care Programme with 17 formulations for pre and post natal care viz.Ayush Candy, Ayush (Rakshoghni malahara). Under new drug development programme 15 new formulation has been developed. In order to provide third party certification, the concept of laboratory accreditation was developed and the Council got NABL accreditation for Captain Srinivasa Murthy Regional Ayurveda Drug Development Institute, Chennai in 2008. Besides NABL accreditation this lab has authority to test drug samples from State Licensing Authority, Government of Tamil Nadu and has been declared as Drug Testing Laboratory (DTL) for ASU (Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani) drugs, Govt, of Tamil Nadu. Under the programme 59 samples were tested for various parameters. The same institute, Captain Srinivasa Murthy Regional Ayurveda Drug Development Institute, Chennai was recognized as a centre for pursuing Ph.D. by different Universities. Total 39 scholars have been awarded Ph.D. and four candidates are pursuing their Ph.D. work. Presently the Institute is recognised by University of Madras as a research centre for Ph.D. Considerable work has been done by CCRAS in evaluation of Pharmacopoeia and Formularies. CCRAS remains member of Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of Committee (APC) since its beginning in 1969 to prepare, finalize and bring out the main task to bringing out Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia in convenient installments on single and compound formulations and Ayurvedic formularies effectively. Director General, CCRAS was nominated as Member Secretary of APC in 2005. The Council has contributed a lot in finalization and publication of Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API) and Ayurvedic Formulary of India (AFI). So Far, CCRAS has contributed 48 monographs in different volumes of API and 8 monographs in Siddha Pharmacopoeia of India (SPI). Monographs on 95 plants have been contributed to the book \"Quality standards of Indian Medicinal plants\" in different volumes published by Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi. 13 guggulu, 28 chuma/kwath chuma, have been examined. 4. Pharmacological Research: Pharmacological studies determine biological effect, effective dose range and overall effectiveness of the optimized lead. It is very important to perform all pharmacological studies in relevant in-vivo and in-vitro test system, which has closest resemblance to human disease condition. These studies give a further understanding into the mechanism of action and an in depth1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI 27 AYUSH SYSTEMS I l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l understanding of the drug action. While, toxicity studies support toxicity profiling evaluation for the drug candidate which includes a battery of in-vivo and in-vitro studies The results eventually help to determine no adverse effect level (NOAEL) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the drug which ultimately helps in calculation for a safer and potentially effective start up dose regimen for human studies. Under pharmacology research, Ayurvedic drugs are studied for their safety evaluation and biological activity in various areas such as diabetes mellitus, bronchial asthma, anti-cancer, immunomodulation, wound healing, anti-urolithiatic, Anti-arthritic, migraine, dengue etc and toxicity study such as acute, sub-acute, chronic, dermal, ocular etc. Besides conducting studies through its own institutes viz. Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Drug Development, Kolkata; Captain Srinivasa Murthy Regional Ayurveda Drug Development Institute, Chennai; Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Drug Development, Gwalior; National Ayurveda Research Institute for Panchakarma, Cheruthuruthy; Regional Ayurveda Institute for Fundamental Research, Pune and the Council collaborates /outsources through institutes of national repute. Approx. 636 studies have been carried out for toxicity evaluation/biological activities since inception. Approx. 50 medicinal plants have been studied out for toxicity evaluation/biological activities since inception. Screening of medicinal plants for their biological activity/pharmacological action and /or safety/toxicity study which may provide leads for further drug development Safety profile of most commonly used classical Safety studies of Ayurvedic classical formulations viz. Jatyadi Grita for urolithiasis have been conducted. Under new drug development, screening of 10 formulations for biological activity/efficacy and safety studies of Ayush QOL-2C for improvement of quality of life for patients receiving chemotherapy/radiotherapy, Ayush-Manas for mental arthritis and Ayush AGT for wound healing have been completed.

Other important Research outcomes: Healthcare seeking trends in Ayurveda: The OPD data (app.62 lac patients) available in annual report of 24 CCRAS institutes for the period 1991-2012 was analyzed to present the healthcare seeking behaviour. The analysis showed that majority of patients (16.17%) suffered from diseases of digestive system followed by musculo-skeletal system (15.88%) and nervous system (11.55%). The data was suggestive of patients inclination towards Ayurveda treatment for chronic and lifestyle related diseases. A Report \"Healthcare seeking trends in Ayurveda A CCRAS Perspective\" was published in 2015 CCRAS published \"Evidence based Ayurvedic Practice\" in 2015 on 18 disease conditions based on the several research studies conducted at CCRAS institutions for the last three decades. The document is an effort to translate research into practice. Some articles published in journals reported the toxicity, presence of heavy metal contents of certain classical/proprietary preparations which created misconceptions regarding the safety of Ayurvedic Rasa Kalpas and Bhasmas. Recognizing the therapeutic importance and safety concerns of such formulations, CCRAS compiled experimental studies conducted by CCRAS and other institutions on safety profile of 15 metal/herbomineral formulations and published a document \"Evidence based Safety of Ayurvedic Herbo-Mineral Formulations\" in 2015. The Council-WHO India country office conducted an operational study to explore the feasibility o f integrating Ayurveda with modem system o f medicine in a tertiary care hospital (Safdarjung Hospital New Delhi) for the management o f Osteoarthritis (Knee) in 2007. The Ayurvedic treatment provided to 201 patients was found effective in the management of Osteoarthritis Knee with respect to reducing the symptoms, improving the quality of life and reducing the intake of rescue medication (analgesics). The project established a cross referral system and revealed a shift in service seeking behaviour of the patients. A Technical report of the study was published by CCRAS in 2007. Feasibility of integration of Ayurveda in RCH programme: The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) carried out the study in a pilot mode for introducing Ayurveda health care system in the conventional system for Antenatal, postnatal and neonatal care with technical support from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Government of India. It was implemented in some selected areas viz. Ladbhadhol & Chauntra blocks of Mandi District of Himachal Pradesh. Total 2465 participants were enrolled in the study. Significant improvement in various outcome indicators such as improvement in Hb%, minimal complications such as vomiting, Edema etc. during pregnancy, achievement of full term pregnancy and nil still birth and neonatal death were observed in the study. Whereas in Himachal Pradesh, Neonatal Mortality Rate (NMR) was 31 per 1000 live births and Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) were 40 according to Sample Registry survey (SRS-2010). Further, there was no mortality of women in the registered cases. No adverse drug reaction (ADR) or adverse event (AE) was reported during the study period. The responsiveness of study participants and the outcome of core indicators reveal the acceptability of study participants for Ayurveda during pregnancy. A paper has been published \"Effectiveness of Ayurvedic AYUSH SYSTEMS interventions for Ante-natal Care (Garbhini Paricharya) at Primary Health Care level - A multi-centre operational Study\" in Journal of Research in Ayurveda and Siddha published by Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences, Ministry of AYUSH, New Delhi (2015). The Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) has conducted scientific studies in collaboration with reputed institutes to establish safety profiles of most commonly used Ayurvedic of India brought out the document \"Evidence Based Safety of Ayurvedic Medicines\" (2016) focusing on safety of Ayurvedic metal and mineral based formulations to present the scientific aspects, relevance and rationale of unique interventions in the public domain. Under Golden Triangle Partnership (GTP) programme, SOPs for preparation, chemical characterization and safety/toxicity studies collaboration with CSIR. The articles/monographs are being published in reputed joumals.Research protocols have also been developed in partnership with ICMR. CCRAS also contributed to TKDL in the matter of collection of published material on Ayurveda, compilation of formulations and generation of Traditional Knowledge Resource Classification (TKRC). 12. Recent Initiatives i. Development and Validation of Prakriti Assessment Questionnaire/Scale The individualized treatment of diseases is the unique approach of Ayurveda which recognize every individual with a specific constitution vis-a-vis Prakriti. Ayurveda classifies all individuals into specific types of 'Prakriti' based o the theory of Tridosha (Three humours as functional entities of the body) i.e. Vata, Pitta & Kapha and their relative ratios. The determination of Prakriti has significant importance in healthy / unhealthy states of an individual. This information can be successfully applied clinically in diagnosis, treatment (for deciding appropriate drug, dose, duration, diet and life style) and prognosis of the disease. Even the daily and seasonal regimens adopted for promotion of health also vary according to Prakriti. For the determination of Prakriti, the characteristic features mentioned in Ayurvedic texts are subjective in nature and the clinicians/Ayurvedic experts apply their own wisdom and experience to capture these features. Considering the need to develop a uniform method for capturing these predictors for assessment and reliability of the data, CCRAS has undertaken the initiative to develop the 'Prakrit Assessment Scale' with rationality, reliability, validity and reproducibility. The project comprises of (i) Development of a comprehensive questionnaire/ Scale for assessment of Prakriti, (ii) Development of Sops for the application of questionnaire/ scale in the form of User Manual (iii) Validation of the questionnaire/scale and (iv) Development of Software for the validated prakriti1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI 37 AYUSH SYSTEMS I l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l assessment tool. The standard Operative Procedures (SoPs) for capturing each predictor have been developed and the same has been elaborately discussed in 'N ational Consultative E xpert Group M eet' comprising of learned experts from various fields of Ayurveda and other contemporary sciences for content validity. For construct validity the developed scale has been given to 20 Ayurvedic physicians, already trained on User manual, at 10 centers situated at different geographical regions of the country for a sample size of 500. Online Data capturing Form also been developed for easy collection of the data and its day to day monitoring. After data analysis and inputs form the investigators, necessary changes as required will be made in the prakriti Assessment questionnaire to make it more comprehensive & user friendly making further reductions which will be subjected for final validation. After standardization of Prakriti Assessment Scale, the study on correlates of Prakriti with genomes and other relevant factors may be planned to establish the concept of Prakriti on scientific footings. ii. National AYUSH Morbidity and Standardized Terminologies Portal (NAMSTP) National AYUSH Morbidities and Standard Terminologies Portal (NAMSTP) is a web based portal exclusively dedicated to the centralized collection of morbidity statistics of various health care provider institutions under the all AYUSH systems spread over the country. This portal was formally launched by Shri Narendra Modi, the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India on the occasion of 2n d Ayurveda Day (17th October 2017). This portal has the potential to revolutionize morbidity statistics data collection and may have a huge impact on the future policy making decision by bringing to light the contributions of various AYUSH systems in the healthcare delivery system of the country. The core objective of this portal is to accurately project the contribution of various AYUSH systems in the healthcare sector of the country through centralized data pooling into a common portal. The Major Benefits o f this portal are real time morbidity data collection; Identification o f areas o f strengths o f the various systems under AYUSH;Electronic Health Record (E.H.RJsystems integrated with morbidity codes; helpful in regulating the healthcare delivery system in AYUSH systems by providing standardizing diagnostic terminologies, thus overcoming the barrier o f the diagnosis being written in Sanskrit-Tamil-Arabic languages in case o f A-S-U systems and the diagnostic codes can serve as a tool fo r documentation in various other programmes such as outreach activities.

Validation and reliability testing of Ayurveda Diagnostic Tools Diagnosis forms the most important part of any medicine as this directly influence the outcome of any treatment. Diagnosis in Ayurveda can be grouped into Roga Pareeksha and Rogi Pareeksha. The examination Astasthana and Dasavidha Pareeksha commonly. Ayurveda has dealt with these examination methods in depth but attaining a uniform diagnosis encompassing all these factors after detailed examination still remains difficult. Bio-medicine has come up with excellent tools of case recording for the purpose of diagnosis. Current Ayurveda graduates are exposed to both systems and though there is an arbitrary system in place to achieve the objective of clinical case recording, the reproducibility in terms of measurable parameters is non-uniform and hence the diagnosis comes out vague. Keeping in view, it's the need of the hour to \"prepare standardized diagnostic protocol(s)/tools\" which are aptly integrated with latest Information Technology tools such as Internet o f things (IoT) to aid Ayurvedic Physician in proper diagnosis and assessment of roga, rogibala and achieve the objective o f \"Anapayi C hikitsa\". Considering this, CCRAS has undertaken a project on reliability testing and validation of Ayurveda diagnostic tools focusing on development of Standardized Ayurvedic Case Taking Protocol(SACTP) in consideration with elements of diagnosis/Case recording from Ayurveda and current Standard health record format(s) ,developing standard diagnostic protocols for selected diseases frequently managed is considered in conjunction for uniform diagnosis and development of an interface for integration/ Customization and development of diagnostic gadgets which are integrated with latest information technology tools for accurate and easy diagnosis. For this purpose, a Standardized Ayurvedic Case Taking Protocol incorporating comprehensive patient history, recording the disease in Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan (SOAP)format wherein subjective and objective parameters are recorded in problem oriented medical record AYUSH SYSTEMS Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll format (POMR) examination of etiology recording of parameters of Dasavidha Pareeksha, in-depth recording of Samprapthi Ghataka to assess pathogenesis of the disease has been planned. iv.

There is a growing awareness today about health and fitness among the masses. Most healthcare specialists today believe that many diseases from which the mankind is afflicted today are the outcome of the stress, wrong living style and the food habits and of the increasing pollution of the environment. Yoga & Naturopathy is becoming the panacea for many of these disorders, as these therapies or practices focuses on bringing perfect harmony between body and mind, correction of life style and to lead a stress free life. Yoga a spiritual science and art of healthy living is derived from the root \"Yujir Yoge \", Yoga means \"the Union\" i.e. union of the individual spirit (Jivatman) with the universal spirit (Parmatman). Maharshi Patanjali describes yoga as cessation of modifications yogaschittavrittinirodhaha. Chitta is conglomeration of manas ahankara (ego). According to Bhagwad Gita, the word Yoga means \"Equanimity of Mind\". The system of Yoga is much older than the archaeological record available to us today and its origin can be traced in Upanishads and ancient Vedic texts. The first archaeological evidence of existence of Yoga is found in Stone Seals excavated from Indus Valley. Yoga was special feature of Indus Valley Civilisation (3000 BC). Maharishi Patanjali, who around 300 BC compiled, modified, systematized and refined Yoga as a system of all round development of human personality through Ashtanga Yoga in his Yoga aphorism, is called the father of Yoga. This pragmatic description enumerates eight stages of Yoga, which if practised systematically allows one to attain a state of sublimation of all mental modifications in the mind and super consciousness ( Samadhi ). These systematic Yoga techniques include from perceptible external sensory stimuli), dharana (concentration), dhyana (meditation) and finally to attain a state of Samadhi (absorption). Apart from Ashtanga Yoga mentioned by sage patanjali, the other classical Yoga texts known as Hathayoga, Gheranda Samhita etc prescribes other techniques such as Kriyas (Purificatory practices), Bandhas (locks and holds which regulate the flow of energy), Mudras (Gestures), Surya namaskara (Sun salutation), Japa, Bhajans, stsang etc. Nature cure is an art and science of healthy living and a drugless system of healing based on well- founded philosophy. It has its own concept of health and disease and the principles of treatment. Nature cure is defined as a system of man developing in harmony with the constructive principles of nature on physical, mental, moral and spiritual planes of living. It has a great health promotive, curative and rehabilitative potential. The main concepts of nature cure are Morbid matter theory and the concept of vital force having its own fundamental principles. The main difference of1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI 45 AYUSH SYSTEMS Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll Naturopathy with other systems is that Naturopathy depends only on the inherent curative power (vitality) within the body whereas other systems lay stress on the curative powers of the medicines. According to Naturopathy as defined by Dr. Henry Lindlahr, \"The primary cause of disease, barring accidental or surgical injury, is violation of Nature's laws\", Enervation, Toxemia, Abnormal Composition of Blood and Lymph and Lowered Vitality. The important therapies or therapeutic modalities of Naturopathy which are employed not only for curative purposes but also for prevention of diseases and promotion of health are Upvas Chikitsa (Fasting Therapy), Aahar Chikitsa (Diet Chikitsa (Magnet Therapy), Marma Chikitsa (Reflexology). Yoga & Naturopathy as a complementary and mind body therapies are being practiced increasingly in both Indian and western populations. Important facets of a yoga program such as relaxation and mental awareness are known to alter the perceptions, and mental responses to both external and internal stimuli, slow down reactivity and responses to such stimuli and instill a greater control over situations in the participants. Naturopathy treatments like Fasting, Hydrotherapy, Mud therapy, Massage etc ancient therapies helps in detoxifying the body, retards the ageing process and rejuvenates the body. Several research studies over the years have shown the effect of yoga & Naturopathy in numerous health problems where mental stress and life style was believed to play a role. Yoga & Naturopathy practices have shown to reduce airway sensitivity and improve pulmonary functions and decrease medication score in asthmatics. They have been used in rehabilitating patients with arthritis in elderly population. They have been found to retard progression of coronary artery disease and control blood glucose levels in NIDDM. They have also been found useful in pulmonary tuberculosis, in preventing epileptic seizures, improving pregnancy outcomes, reducing anxiety, depression in both healthy as well as diagnosed cases, reducing negative affect, improving positive affect and quality of life among cancer patients. These practices have also shown to improve immunity and reduce stress hormone levels. 4.2 Premier organizations of Yoga Central Council for Research in Yoga & Naturopathy (CCRYN) CCRYN is an autonomous organisation fully funded by Govt, of India, Ministry of AYUSH. CCRYN was established in 1978 under the Society Registration Act, 1860. The objective of the Council is to conduct scientific research in the field of Yoga & Naturopathy. In order to fulfil this objective and to evaluate the efficacy of Yoga & Naturopathy in various disease conditions, the Council provides financial assistance to premier Medical as well Yoga and Naturopathy Institutions of the country for undertaking clinical research studies. The findings of some of the research studies are very encouraging and the utility and efficacy of Yoga & Naturopathy in the treatment of different psychosomatic and life style disorders is being established. The main objectives of the Council are as under: The formulation of aims and patterns of research on scientific lines in Yoga & Naturopathy. AYUSH SYSTEMS Illlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll To undertake any education, training, research and other programmes in Yoga & Naturopathy. The prosecution of and assistance in research, the propagation of knowledge and experimental measures generally in connection with the causation, mode of spread and prevention of diseases. To initiate, aid, develop and coordinate scientific research in different aspects, fundamental and applied of Yoga and Naturopathy and to promote and assist institutions of research for the study of diseases, their prevention, causation and remedy. To prepare, print, publish and exhibit any papers, posters, pamphlets, periodicals and books for furtherance of the objects of the Central Council and to contribute to such literature. To offer prizes and grant of scholarships, including travelling scholarships in furtherance of the objects of the Central Council. Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga (MDNIY) MDNIY is an autonomous institution fully funded by Govt, of India, Ministry of Health and Family welfare, Department of AYUSH. MDNIY is a focal institute for Planning, Training, Promotion and Coordination of Yoga Education, Training, Therapy and Research in all its aspects. MDNIY aims to promote deeper understanding of Yoga philosophy and practices based on classical Yoga amongst people. The main vision and Mission of the Institute is \"Health, Harmony and Happiness for all through Yoga\". National Institute of Naturopathy (NIN), Pune, Maharashtra The National Institute of Naturopathy (NIN), Pune was established in 1986 under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 with the objective to conduct, facilitate & encourage research activities in all aspects concerning human health and to develop Naturopathy as a system of medicine and as a way of life beside other objectives. It is located at the historical place called \"Bapu Bhavan\", named after Mahatma Gandhi, Father of the Nation, who stayed here during his visits from 1944 to 1947, and conducted his experiments on Nature Yogic Practices & Treatment YOGA is an ancient Indian science and is one among the six great Indian philosophies. In the spiritual dimension yoga is a path towards attainment of super conscious states beyond sensory perception and knowledge. There are many methods of yoga catering to the needs of different persons in society to bring about the transformation of the individual. They are broadly classified into four streams. Swami Vivekananda puts them as work and worship, philosophy and psychic control. 1. Karma Yoga: This path of working in relaxation involves doing action with an attitude of detachment to fruits of action. This makes man release himself from the strong attachments and thereby brings in him a steadiness of mind which verily is Yoga-'Samatvam yogah AYUSH SYSTEMS Uchyate'. Instruments of action and understanding (Karmendriyas and Jnanendriyas) get cleansed. 2. Bhakti Yoga: The control of emotions is the key in the path of worship that involves pure love to the divine and is characterized by total surrender. In this modem world, man is tossed up and down due to emotional onslaughts. The path of Bhakti is a boon to gain control over emotional instabilities by properly harnessing the energy involved in it. It teaches egolessness and surrender. 3. Jnana Yoga: The present age of science has made man a rational being. Intellectual sharpness is imminent. Analysis forms the tool. The path of philosophy (jnana Yoga) is apt for the keen intellectuals and is centered around the analysis of 'happiness', the vital contribution of Upanishads. Also many other fundamental questions regarding the mind, the outside and inside world and the reality are taken up. Basic questions are raised even involving the intellect itself to reach the very basis of intellect. It follows steps of shravana (Listening carefully), manana (contemplation) and nididhyasana (forming own views). According to Maharshi Patanjali Yoga is defined as the process of sublimation of all mental modifications in the mind through a systematic process of yamas (moral doctrines), niyamas away from perceptible external sensory stimuli), dharana (concentration), dhyana (meditation) and finally to attain a state of Samadhi (absorption). Attainment of such a contemplative absorptive state has been elucidated to confer a blissful state of mind and body. Each step of Yoga not only enlightens the soul but also increases physical strength, endurance, power of mind, establishes emotional stability and social security. The practices of Yoga leads to promotion of health, prevention of disease, effective management of all mental disturbances and better understanding of higher level of consciousness. Yama & Niyama: The Classical text of Yoga written by Maharshi Patanjali advocates eight stages of practice known as Ashtanga Yoga. The first two, Yama and Niyama are universal and individual disciplines (Restraints & Conduct) that teach us the art of living gracefully. They areI INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I Yama (Restraints) Niyama (Rules of conduct) Ahimsa Non-Violence Shaucha Surrender and devotion to God The practice of Yama promotes psychological, social and spiritual well-being of an individual and reduces stress and resultant emotional disturbance caused by voilance, lies, stealing and possessiveness. Practice of Yama paves way to increase the power of concentration, mental purity AYUSH SYSTEMS 48 and steadiness. Whereas observance of Niyamas provides sense of discipline in personal life which results in good health of body and mind. Shatkriyas - Six Cleansing Techniques Gheranda Samhita and Hatha Yoga advises cleansing of body before taking further course of yogic practices. Shatkriyas are cleansing techniques using 'external objects' These are 6 types and therefore termed as 'shat' kriyas. Each one of which consists of many sub-sections. Shatkriyas bring control on different reflexes and establish psycho-physiological balance. The main effects of kriyas 1) Cleansing, activating and revitalizing the organs. 2) Tones up the functions of the organs. 3) Desensitization. 4) Development of deep internal awareness. These kriyas are as under : 1) Dhauti for cleansing upper Gastro Intestinal Track (GIT) up to stomach. 2) Basti for cleansing Lower Gastro Intestinal Track (GIT) especially the rectum. (Shankha Prakshalana is for the entire GIT). 3) Neti for cleansing upper nasal tract (from throat to nostrils). 4) Trataka for cleansing the eyes. 5) Nauli for cleansing the abdominal organs and 6) Kapalabhati for cleansing the lower respiratory tract (from nostrils to lungs). Asanas: Yogasanas are physical postures. Asanas are not just physical exercises, they have to be performed in a very systematic way without any haste, with an attitude of total awareness. Maharshi Patanjali defines asana as \" Sthirsukhamasanam \" PYS.II.46 \" Posture which is steady and comfortable is Asana \" Asanas are postures which are to be maintained in the final posture with ease and effortlessness. The maintenance of the final posture for a long duration with deep relaxation can be achieved by continuous effort prayatna shaithilya. Leading to a state of anantasamapatti \" Prayatnashaithilyanantasamapattibhyam \" PYS.II.47 Regular practice of asanas lead to \"Tato dvandvanabhighataha '' PYS.II.48 \"Thereby the pairs o f opposites cease to have any impact\" There are as many Asanas as the number of living beings! Although Patanjali does not specifically name any Asana, he gives the characteristics of Asana such as firmness and stability and leading to a non-dual state. Patanjali mentions asanas only as a pre-requisite to other advanced practices of Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana and Samadhi. Subsequent texts such as Hathayoga Pradipika do mention the names of specific asanas.Asanas are not to be treated merely exercises; they are postures which involve the body (skeleton-muscels as well as mind, breath, senses and intelligence). To perform them one needs a clean airy place, a blanket and determination.

Asanas brings steadiness, health and lightness of body. A steady and pleasant posture produces mental equilibrium and prevents fickleness of mind. Pranayama Pranayama, the fourth constituent of yoga, deals with the control of prana and energy, grossly translated as breath. Pranayama does not allow the vital energy (prana) to dissipate, but stores it in the cells for the better use of life. Prana means breath, respiration, life, vitality, wind, energy orstrength. Ayama means length, expansion, stretching or restraint. Pranayama thus connotes extension of breath and its control. This control is mainly over the three aspects of breathing, namely, (1) inhalation or inspiration, which is termed puraka (filling up), (2) exhalation or expiration, which is called recaka (emptying) and (3) retention or holding the breath either after inhalation or after exhalation. This is termed kumbhaka (pot either full or empty). \"Tasminsati shvasaprashvasayorgati vichhedahpranayamah \" PYS.11.49 After mastering posture (Asana) one must practice control o f the prana (pranayama) by regulating the motions o f inspiration, and expiration. Pratyahara, the fifth constituent, begins with the inner quest and acts as a foundation in the path of renunciation. Pratyahara helps the senses of perception and memory to reside quietly, each in its place, and to cease importuning the mind for their gratification, making them let go the tastes and flavours to which they are addicted. The mind, which till now acted as a bridge between the senses and the seer, draws back from the contact of the senses, and turns inwards to explore spiritual wealth, and the domain of the seer. In fact pratyahara is an effect of Pranayama. Dharana, dhyana and samadhi are the last three aspects of astanga yoga. Dharana is the confinement of attention to an object or region outside or inside the body. Dhyana is the attention flowing uninterruptedly, and samadhi is total absorption in the object of meditation. These three constituents of yoga are experiencing states. They cannot be presented with explanations Bandhas and Mudras Bandha means restraints. The bandhas are locks and holds which regulate the flow of energy. They play a crucial role in pranayama. There are different types of bandhas like uddiyana wherein the energy is made to flow from the lower abdomen upwards towards the head. The jalandhara bandha is a 'lock' in the pit of the throat. The third important bandha is the mula bandha wherein SURYANAMASKARA (Salutations to Sun) Adoration and worship of the sun was one of the man's first and most natural forms of inner expression. Most of the ancient traditions included some forms of sun worship, incorporating various solar symbols and deities, but nowhere have these traditions been as well as preserved as they are in the Vedic culture. Human culture lies in the ancient Vedic scriptures, which contains numerous shlokas referring to the sun. Suryanamaskar comprises of 12 positions and 12 mantras that are recited at the beginning. The practice of Suryanamaskara energizes the entire system of the body. Its regular practice ensures a perfect harmony to all the systems of the body. AYUSH SYSTEMS Illlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll SCIENTIFIC BASIS OF USING YOGA AS A THERAPY: Extensive research on Yoga being done all over the world has shown promise with regard to various disorders and diseases that seem to be amiable to Yoga therapy. These include psychosomatic, stress disorders such as bronchial asthma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, irritable bowel syndrome, gastro intestinal ulcer diseases, atherosclerosis, seizure disorder and headache. It also includes physical disorders such as heart disease, lung disease, and mental retardation. Psychiatric disorders such as anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression and substance abuse can also be managed along with other therapies. Musculoskeletal disorders such as lumbago, spondylosis, sciatica and carpel tunnel syndrome can be tackled effectively with Yoga practices that offer a lot of hope in metabolic disorders such as thyroid and other endocrine disorders, immune disorders, obesity and the modem metabolic syndrome. Some of the researched benefits that are quite well proven are given below to facilitate an understanding of how Yoga works at least at the physical level though we are yet to research and understand subtler effects of Yoga. PHYSIOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA: It has been found that Yoga produces stable autonomic nervous system equilibrium, with a tendency toward parasympathetic nervous system dominance rather than the usual stress-induced sympathetic nervous system dominance. This is of great potential in psychosomatic stress related illness abounding in populations worldwide. Cardiovascular and cardio-respiratory efficiency increases. Heart rate and blood pressure decrease implying a better state of relaxation leading to reduced load on the heart. Respiratory rate decreases with improved respiratory efficiency. The amplitude and smoothness of respiration increases, along with all parameters of pulmonary function such as tidal volume, vital capacity and breath-holding time. EEG - alpha waves increase. Theta, delta, and beta waves also increase during various stages of meditation. Gastrointestinal function and endocrine function normalizes with improvement in excretory functions. Musculoskeletal flexibility and joint range of motion increase. Posture improves with improvement in strength, resiliency and endurance. Body weight normalizes and sleep improves with increased energy levels and the immunity increases with improved ability of pain tolerance. PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA: It has been found that somatic and kinesthetic awareness increase with better self-acceptance and self-actualization. There is better social adjustment with decrease in anxiety, depression and hostility. Psychomotor functions such as grip strength, balance, dexterity and fine motor skills, eye hand coordination and reaction time, steadiness and depth perception, and the integrated functioning of body parts improve. Mood improves and subjective well-being increases while cognitive functions such as attention, concentration, memory, and learning efficiency improve BIOCHEMICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA: The biochemical profile improves, indicating an anti\u00ad stress and antioxidant effect which is important in the prevention of degenerative diseases. There are decreased levels of blood glucose, total white blood cell count, total cholesterol, Triglycerides, LDL and VLDL. At the same time it has been reported that there are increased levels of: HDL cholesterol, ATPase, hematocrit, hemoglobin, thyroxin, lymphocytes, vitamin C and total serum protein following Yoga. AYUSH SYSTEMS Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll It is well established that stress weakens our immune system. Scientific research in recent times has showed that the physiological, psychological and biochemical effects of Yoga are of an anti-stress nature. Mechanisms postulated included the restoration of autonomic balance as well as an improvement in restorative, regenerative and rehabilitative capacities of the individual. A healthy inner sense of wellbeing produced by a life of Yoga percolates down through the different levels of our existence from the higher to the lower producing health and wellbeing of a holistic nature. Streeter et al (Med Hypotheses 2012;78: 571-9) recently proposed a theory to explain the benefits of Yoga practices in diverse, frequently comorbid medical conditions based on the concept that Yoga practices reduce allostatic load in stress response systems such that optimal homeostasis is restored. Theyhypothesized that stress induces an: 1. Imbalance of the ANS with decreased parasympathetic and increased sympathetic activity, 2. Under activity of the gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA) system, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter system, and 3. Increased allostatic load. They further hypothesized that Yoga-based practices 1. Correct underactivity of the parasympathetic nervous system and GABA systems in part through stimulation of the vagus nerves, the main peripheral pathway of the parasympathetic nervous system, and 2. Reduce allostatic load. According to the theory proposed by Streeter and colleagues, the decreased parasympathetic nervous system and GABAergic activity that underlies stress-related disorders can be corrected by Yoga practices resulting in amelioration of disease symptoms. HRV testing has a great role to play in our understanding intrinsic mechanisms behind such potential effects of Yoga. Innes et al had earlier (J Am Board Fam Pract 2005; ,18: 491-519) also postulated two interconnected pathways (given below) by which Yoga reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases through the mechanisms of parasympathetic activation coupled with decreased reactivity of sympathoadrenal system and HPA axis.

A tb e ftK k m l] HjpertessiM CVD Fundamental Principles of Naturopathy Some of the fundamental principles of Naturopathy are outlined as under: 1. Naturopathy believes in the concept of unity of disease and unity of cure. According to it root cause of all diseases are one that is accumulation of morbid matter in the body and the remedy also is one i.e. elimination of those toxins from the body. 2. Naturopathy considers bacteria and virus to be secondary cause of disease. The primary cause of disease is toxemia in the body. The microbes survive in the body only when a favourable atmosphere (environment) for their growth is established by the accumulation of morbid matter. Hence, the basic cause of disease is morbid matter and microbes are only the secondary findings. 3. Acute diseases are self-healing efforts of the body. Hence, they are taken as our friends, not enemies. Chronic diseases are outcome of wrong treatment and suppression of the acute diseases. 4. Human body has remarkable recuperative powers when left alone. Nature is the greatest healer. The human body is a self healing machine (the human body as a self healing capacity). It is endowed with inherent healing power to prevent itself from disease and regain health when fallen ill. 5. In Naturopathy the patient is at the centre of intervention and treatment, cure of disease is effected automatically with the increase in vitality and detoxification of body. 6. Naturopathy believes in holistic treatment. It not only treats the body as a whole, instead of specific organs but also take into account intervention at mental, moral and spiritual planes. 7. Naturopathy does not use medicines. According to it, \"Food is Medicine\". 8. Naturopathy accepts prayer also as a modality of treatment. According to Gandhiji \" Rama Nama is the best Natural Treatment\" means doing prayer according to one's own faith is an important part of treatment. AYUSH SYSTEMS Cause of Disease according to Naturopathy: According to Naturopathy as defined by Dr. Henry Lindlahr, \"The primary cause of disease, barring accidental or surgical injury, is violation of Nature's laws\". Violation of Nature's Laws Enervation Toxemia Abnormal Composition of Blood and Lymph Lowered Vitality To prevent the diseases one has to obey the universal laws of nature in life by adopting the natural methods of living and of treatment. These methods which are applicable in the prevention and management of most of the disorders have been described by Dr. Lindlahr as under: Return to Nature by the regulation of eating, drinking breathing, bathing, dressing, working, resting, thinking, the moral life, sexual and social activities, etc. establishing them on a normal and natural basis.

Application of Yoga in disease including rehabilitation The use of Yoga as a complementary and mind-body therapy is rapidly increasing worldwide. The psychosomatic, stress relieving, health benefits of yoga in numerous conditions has been established and systematic reviews published by Funderburk (1977), Khalsa (2004), Innes (2005 and 2007) and Yang (2007). The benefits of yoga as a lifestyle modification have also been reported by Bijlani (2005) and Sharma (2008). Yoga as a therapy is also cost effective, relatively simple to learn, and carries minimal risk; hence it should be advocated as an adjunct, complementary therapy in our search for an integrated system of medicine capable of producing health and wellbeing for all. Some of the important studies reporting the therapeutic effects of yoga are given below: Hypertension and H eart disease Yoga has preventive, promotive as well as curative potential. Yoga based lifestyle confers so many advantages to the practitioner that beyond doubt it is the best ever designed lifestyle in the history of mankind. Scientific studies have started giving documented evidence to this belief of the practitioners. Since lifestyle related diseases such as coronary artery disease, obesity and hypertension are alarmingly on the rise in our modem society, yoga based lifestyle should be given a special place in preventing and managing these diseases. As early as 1930's Swami Kuvalayananda of Kaivalyadhama started studying the effects of yogic practices on blood pressure, heart rate etc. in yogis. Madanmohan et al (1983) studied the effect of shavasan and savitri pranayam in trained subjects and found significant decrease in oxygen consumption, heart rate and diastolic blood pressure. They attributed it to the ability of the subjects to achieve a state of deep psychosomatic relaxation. Shavasan alone has been shown to be effective in the treatment of hypertension (Datey et al 1969; Patel and North 1975). This was attributed to decrease frequency and intensity of proprioceptive and enteroceptive impulse traffic reaching the hypothalamus. In another open study there was a reduction in blood pressure after just 2 months of yogic life style change (Sachdeva et al 1994). Schmidt et al (1997) found out that there was significant reduction in cardiovascular risk factors after 3 months of residential yoga and meditation training program that included low fat lacto- vegetarian diet. Body mass index, total serum and LDL cholesterol, fibrinogen, and blood pressure were significantly reduced especially in the subjects with elevated levels. Obesity is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease (Tani et al 2009). In a study on 40 male student volunters (12-15 years), Bera and Rajapurkar (1993) found that after 1 year of yoga practice, there was significant improvement in ideal body weight, body density, cardiovascular endurance and anaerobic power. Mahajan et al (1999) demonstrated that subjects with known ischemic heart disease and as well as healthy subjects practicing yoga showed a regular decrease in all lipid parameters except HDL. Thus, the effect of yogic lifestyle on some of the modifiable risk factors could probably explain the preventive and therapeutic beneficial effect observed in coronary artery AYUSH SYSTEMS disease. Murugesan et al (2000) have demonstrated that regular yoga practice of 1 hour/day done for a period of 11 weeks was as effective as medical therapy in controlling high blood pressure in hypertensive subjects. Selvamurthy et al (1998) found that baroreflex sensitivity was reduced in essential hypertension. They administered 3 week course of yoga exercises consisting of head-up and head-down tilt asanas and reported significant reduction in blood pressure with gradual improvement in baroreflex sensitivity with progressive attenuation of sympatho-adrenal and renin- angiotensin activity. Manchanda et al (2000), Ornish et al (1990) and Yogendra et al (2004) have conducted prospective, randomized and controlled trials on angiographically proven coronary artery disease patients with yoga intervention and demonstrated that yoga based lifestyle modification helps in regression of coronary lesions and improvement in myocardial perfusion. This translated into clinical and symptomatic improvement. The work of Dean Ornish in reversing heart disease has become a major land mark in preventive cardiology. Various studies using lifestyle and stress reduction interventions have shown to reduce the risk factors associated with the disease and reduce incidence of cardiovascular events. Studies have shown yoga to improve endothelial function and reduce autonomic reactivity (Sivasankaran et al 2006), reduce oxidative stress (Yadav et al 2005) and inflammatory markers, dyslipidemia (Mahajan et al 1999), improve health behaviours and also reduce blocks in the coronary arteries. These studies and earlier studies using lifestyle interventions offer conclusive evidence for utility of yoga interventions in CAD and as such yoga interventions can also facilitate both acute and long term changes in risk factor reduction (Jatupom et al 2003, Yadav et al 2005). This intervention if used in conjunction with conventional treatment can help reduce health care costs, prevent secondary complications and improve quality of life (Jayasinghe 2004). Innes and Vincent (2007) suggested that yoga reduces the risk profile in cardiovascular diseases by decreasing activation of the sympatho-adrenal system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and also by promoting a feeling of wellbeing along with direct enhancement of parasympathetic activity via the vagus nerve. Recent works on yoga and hypertension have explored intrinsic mechanisms behind beneficial changes in such a population and both long term as well as short terms effects of yogic techniques have been elucidated (Selvamurthy et al 1998, Vijayalakshmi et al 2004, Pramanik et al 2009, Bhavanani et al 2011 and 2012). Diabetes Mellitus Diabetes is a major global health problem. India now has the largest population of diabetics internationally, 19 million. India is also expected to show the highest increase in prevalence internationally by 2025 (195% growth) (WHO report, 2004)'Moderate weight loss and increased physical activity can preventor delay the development of type 2 diabetes in high-risk groups,such as those with impaired glucose tolerance (Eriksson and Lindgarde 1998, Pan et al 1997, Tuomilehto et al 2001). Lifestylechanges have been shown to be nearly twice as effective as metformin therapy(31% reduction in incidence of diabetes) in preventing type2 diabetes (Tuomilehto et al 2001).Moderate weight loss (5% of body weight)can improve insulin action, decrease fasting bloodI INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I AYUSH SYSTEMS 56 glucose concentrations,and reduce the need for diabetes medications.Comprehensive reviews by Innes et al (2005, 2007) found beneficial changes in several risk indices, including glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, anthropometric characteristics, blood pressure, oxidative stress, coagulation profiles, sympathetic activation and pulmonary function, as well as improvement in specific clinical outcomes. They suggested that yoga may improve risk profiles in adults with NIDDM and may have promise in the prevention and management of cardiovascular complications in such a population. Many studies have reported the benefit of yoga in patients of diabetes. Sahay and colleagues demonstrated a significant reduction in fasting and post-prandial blood glucose levels, insulin-glucose ratio, and a reduction in oral hypoglycemic and insulin requirements in 35 diabetic subjects after yoga practices (Jain et al 1993, Sahay 1986 and 2002). Another controlled trial of 21 subjects with type 2 diabetes found that fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels were significantly reduced in the group who practiced the integrated program of daily yoga for 12 weeks as compared to a matched control group (Malhotra et al 2002). They have also reported improvements in nerve conduction and pulmonary function. Madanmohan et al (2012) reported that a comprehensive six-week yoga therapy training program produces significant improvement in reaction time, blood glucose and lipid profile of peri and post-menopausal diabetes patients. They concluded that a comprehensive yoga therapy program has the potential to enhance the beneficial effects of standard medical management of DM and can be used in an effective complementary or integrative therapy program. These studies provide some preliminary evidence of the beneficial effects of yoga on glucose tolerance and long-term glycemic control, however randomized controlled studies are needed to validate these findings. Asthma and Allergies The scientific basis of using yoga as an adjunct therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases is well established with significant improvements in lung function, quality of life indices, and bronchial provocation responses coupled with a decreased need for regular and rescue medicinal usage. (Nagarathna and Nagendra 1985, Vempati et al 2009). Behera (1998) reported perceptible improvement in dyspnea and lung function in patients with chronic bronchitis after 4 weeks of yoga therapy that used a variety of postures and breathing techniques. Yogic cleansing techniques such as neti kriya (warm saline nasal wash) remove excessive mucous secretions, decrease inflammation, and reduce bronchial hypersensitivity thereby increasing provocation threshold while kapalabhati (a yogic breathing technique), through forceful exhalations, improves the capacity to exhale against resistance (Satyaprabha 2001). A nonspecific bronchoprotective or bronchorelaxing effect has also been postulated by Singh (1987) while improved exercise tolerance has been reported following yoga therapy in patients with chronic severe airways obstruction (Tandon 1978). It has been reported that well-performed slow yogic breathing maintains better blood oxygenation without increasing minute ventilation, reduces sympathetic activation during altitude-induced hypoxia (Bemardi 2001) and decreases chemoreflex sensitivity to hypoxia and hypercapnia (Spicuzza 2000). All of these mechanisms can help bring about both objective and subjective improvements in the condition of patients with bronchitis. Numerous studies have given evidence of the beneficial effects of yoga in patients of respiratory conditions. Most of these studies show equivocal evidence for improvement in lung function (Birkel and Edgren 2000, Fluge et al 1994, Jain et al 1993, Khanam et al 1996, Nagarathna and Nagendra1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI 57 AYUSH SYSTEMS 1985, Makwana et al 1988), decreased medication score (Cooper et al 2003, Vedanthan et al 1998), improvement in quality of life and mood (Manocha et al 2002) and decrease symptomatology (Cooper et al 2003, Singh 1987, Tandon 1978). Studies have also shown decrease in airway reactivity (Manocha et al 2002, Singh 1987), decreased sympathetic reactivity (Khanam et al 1996), additive effect of yoga with medications (Fluge et al 1994, Vempati et al 2009) and sustained benefits with regular practice and practice for a longer duration (Nagendra and Nagarathna 1986). Most of these studies are proof of concept and outcome studies and evidence regarding the mechanism of action of yoga intervention is still lacking. The concepts of this holistic and integrated mindful yoga program have been elaborated in earlier studies (Goyeche et al 1982, Nagarathna and Nagendra 1985). This integrated yoga module which is a combination of breathing exercises, asanas, kriyas, pranayama, meditation and relaxation has shown improved pulmonary function, decreased symptomatology, reduced medication score in the long run and decrease in duration of acute asthma episodes. Mood and Psychiatric Disorders A large number of studies show that the practice of yoga can produce significant decrease in the basal anxiety scores. Khalsa et al (2009) found that two months of yoga and meditation techniques can reduce performance anxiety and mood disturbance in young professional musicians. Javnbakht et al (2009) reported that participation in a two-month yoga program lead to a significant reduction in perceived levels of anxiety in women who suffered from anxiety disorders. Kozasa et al (2008) reported significant reduction in scores on anxiety, depression, and tension after one month practice of yoga program. Woolery et al (2004) found that subjects who participated in a 5 week yoga course demonstrated significant decreases in self-reported symptoms of depression and trait anxiety. Sharma et al (2005) found that two months of sahaj yoga meditation by patients of major depression who were on anti-depressant medication led to higher rates of remission, statistically more reduction in Hamilton depression and anxiety scores as compared to those patients who were only on anti-depressant medication. Similarly, Michalsen et al (2005) reported that 3 month Iyengar yoga program for women suffering from mental distress resulted in significant improvements in perceived stress, state and trait anxiety, subjective well-being, vigor and decrease in salivary cortisol, fatigue and depression. Physical well-being also increased, and those subjects suffering from headache or back pain reported marked pain relief. From this it is clear, yoga has got a potential role as a component in the management of depressive and anxiety disorders. Malathi and Damodaran (1999) studied the effect of yogic practices on anxiety status during routine activities and prior to examination in first year MBBS students. They found a decrease in their anxiety status as assessed by Spillberger's anxiety scale. In addition, the anxiety scores which rose prior to exams showed a statistically significant reduction on the day of exam. The results of the exam indicated a statistically significant reduction in number of failures in yoga group as compared to the control group. The improvement in various parameters such as sense of well being, feeling of relaxation, improved concentration, self confidence, improved efficiency, good interpersonal relationship, increased attentiveness, lowered irritability levels, and an optimistic outlook in life were some of the beneficial effects enjoyed by the yoga group as indicated by feedback score. These results point to the beneficial role of yoga in not only causing reduction in basal anxiety level but also attenuating the increase in anxiety score in stressful states such as examinations. Apparently, a decrease in anxiety scores in yoga practitioners leads to their better adjustment to the environmentalI INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I AYUSH SYSTEMS 58 Illlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll and internal stressors. Therefore, they are able to perform their duties with calm disposition which improves their performance. Gupta et al (2006) reported a decrease in state and trait anxiety scores in healthy subjects as well as patients after 10 days of yoga based lifestyle intervention program. Regular practice of yoga and meditation alters levels of various neuro-transmitters in the brain. Kjaer et al (2002) used PET scan technique to demonstrate 65% increase in endogenous dopamine release in the ventral striatum during yoga nidra meditation. Yoga nidra is associated with decreased blood flow in prefrontal, cerebellar and subcortical regions, structures thought to be organized in open loops subserving executive control. In the striatum, dopamine modulates excitatory glutamatergic synapses of the projections from the frontal cortex to striatal neurons, which in turn project back to the frontal cortex via the pallidum and ventral thalamus. They found that increased striatal dopamine release during meditation is associated with the experience of reduced readiness for action. They suggested that being in the conscious state of meditation causes a suppression of cortico-striatal glutamatergic transmission which provides in vivo regulation of conscious states at the synaptic level. Streeter et al (2007) demonstrated that in experienced yoga practitioners, brain GABA levels increase after a session of yoga. Yoga practitioners completed a 60 minute yoga session and comparison subjects completed a 60 minute reading session. This suggests that the practice of yoga should be explored as a treatment for disorders with low GABA levels such as depression and anxiety disorders. Effect on pregnancy Preliminary evidence from various scientific studies supports Yoga's potential efficacy, particularly if started early in the pregnancy. A study by Beddoe et al showed that women practicing Yoga in their second trimester reported significant reductions in physical pain from baseline to post intervention compared with women in the third trimester whose pain increased. Women in their third trimester showed greater reductions in perceived stress and trait anxiety. Another study by Sun et al (2009) reported that women who took part in the prenatal Yoga programme reported significantly fewer pregnancy discomforts at 38-40 weeks of gestation. The subjects who participated in the Yoga programme exhibited higher outcome and self-efficacy expectancies during the active stage of labour and the second stage of labour. They also suggested that the provision of booklets and videos on Yoga during pregnancy may contribute to a reduction in pregnancy discomforts and improved childbirth self-efficacy. Satyapriya et al (2009) concluded that Yoga reduces perceived stress and improves adaptive autonomic response to stress in healthy pregnant women while Chuntharapat et al (2008) concluded that Yoga produced higher levels of maternal comfort during labor and 2hour post-labor with a decrease in subject evaluated labor pain. They also reported shorter duration of the first stage of labor, as well as the total time of labor in the subjects practicing Yoga. A study by Narendran et al (2005) reported a lower trend in the occurrence of complications of pregnancy such as pregnancy-induced hypertension, intrauterine growth retardation and pre-term delivery in subjects who practiced Yoga. He also concluded that an integrated approach to Yoga during pregnancy is safe. It improves birth weight, decreases preterm labor, and decreases IUGR either in isolation or associated with PIH, with no increased complications. A review by Field (2008) reported that alternative therapies have been found effective for reducing pregnancy-related back and leg pain and nausea and for reducing depression AYUSH SYSTEMS and cortisol levels and the associated prematurity rate. It also said that the labor research generally shows that alternative therapies reduce pain and thereby the need for medication. Yoga in rehabilitation Yoga practices have been tried in the rehabilitation of various socially disadvantaged groups like inmates of jails, drug abusers, alcoholics, congenitally blind, mentally retarded and children from community (remand) homes. In all these socially disadvantaged groups yoga can be of use through providing better awareness and mastery over repressed anger or depression or anxiety which could be a common underlying factor that can interfere with their efficiency in any new learning for better living or for improved performance. Children in community homes although physically normal were socially and emotionally traumatized. Significantly higher level of sympathetic arousal as seen by heart rate, respiratory rate, skin resistance was seen in community home girls in Bangalore compared to regular school children (Telles et al 1997). In a comparative study, there was a significant reduction in breath rate, skin resistance, performance on muscle power, dexterity skill and visual perception in the yoga group compared to the group practicing games in 14 pairs of girls in the age group 12-16 years, from a community home (Raghuraj and Telles 1997). Yoga for behavioural disorders Special education for the mentally retarded has now been well streamlined and these children are getting integrated into general education. Yoga has been tried out as an adjunct in education of children with mental retardation, learning disabilities and attention deficit hyperactivity syndromes. Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram (1983) documented and reported subjective improvements and also described the practices of yoga adopted for these children. In a matched control study on 90 retarded children (mild to moderate retardation) practising Integrated yoga program daily for one hour over a period of one year as an adjunct to the standard techniques of special education have shown significant improvement in IQ and social adaptation in addition to improvement in locomotor skills (Uma et al 1989). They suggested that the breath control obtained through yoga increases psycho-motor coordination. They concluded that yoga improves concentration, attention- span and enhances IQ and memory power by gaining conscious control over the mind. Bhavanani et al (2012) studied the immediate effect of mukha bhastrika (a bellows type pranayama) on reaction time in mentally challenged adolescents and suggested that such yogic breathing techniques be used as an effective means of improving neuromuscular abilities in special children. Yoga for promotion of positive health Yoga interventions are known to affect physical health by increasing motor control and performance (Telles et al 1994, Telles et al 1993), alter metabolism and autonomic function (Telles et al 1994) and improve ventilatory functions of the lungs including a prolongation of breath holding time (Joshi et al 1992). There have also been a number of studies suggesting that yoga produces acute physiological changes (Madanmohan et al 1983, 1992, 2003,2004, Telles and Desiraju 1992, Telles et al 1994, Telles et al 2000, Udupa et al 2003) and promotes physical health by improving performance. Bera and Rajapurkar (1993) have reported that yoga training results in S iI INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I AYUSH SYSTEMS Illlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll significant improvement in cardiovascular endurance and anaerobic threshold. This is consistent with the findings of Muralidhara and Ranganathan (1982) who have reported an improvement in cardiac recovery index after 10 week yoga training program as indicated by Harvard step test. Raju et al (1994) have found that subjects who practised pranayam could achieve higher work rates with reduced oxygen consumption per unit work and without increase in blood lactate levels. Madanmohan et al (2004) have demonstrated that after 2 months of yoga training, a given level of exercise leads to a milder cardiovascular response, suggesting better exercise tolerance. These findings are consistent with findings of Ray et al (2001) that yoga training increases muscular endurance, delays onset of fatigue and enables one to perform work at lesser VO 2 max. A positive mental health would be achieved by sharpening of perception of information arriving to the brain through all our special senses, better analytical faculty (IQ), sharper memory and on the overall improvement in personality characteristics. Studies show that practice of yogic techniques cause improvement in aspects of perception, thinking, reasoning, and remembering the task. Yogic techniques improve attentiveness and this in turn decreases response time or reaction time, a simple means of determining sensory-motor performance. Madanmohan et al (1992) reported that yoga practice for 12 weeks results in significant reduction in visual and auditory reaction times in the normal adult male volunteers. Malathi and Parulkar (1989) also reported reduction in auditory and visual reaction time after yoga training. Similar, findings were also demonstrated immediately after the practice of mukh bhastrika pranayama (Bhavanani et al 2003). Sarang and Telles (2007) reported that yoga practice brings about a greater improvement in this task which requires selective attention, concentration, visual scanning abilities, and a repetitive motor response. In an another study (Sarang and Telles 2006), they reported a reduction in the peak latencies of P300 after yoga based relaxation technique as meditation enhances cognitive processes underlying generation of P300. Yoga affects every cell of the body. It brings about better neuro-effector communication, improves strength of the body, increases the optimum functioning of all organ-systems, increases resistance against stress and diseases and brings tranquility, balance, positive attitude and equanimity in the practitioner which makes him lead a purposeful and healthier life. Scientific Research on Applications of Naturopathy Naturopathy provides benefit in numerous health care concerns in which mental stress and lifestyle factors are believed to play a major role. Naturopathy treatments like Fasting, Hydrotherapy, Mud therapy, Massage therapy, Sun bath etc. help in detoxifying the body. The potentials, simplicity and cost effectiveness of Naturopathy has convinced the people to look towards this system. Advancement in the medical field has started exploring the beneficial effects of Naturopathy in the treatment of various disorders especially the lifestyle related and psychosomatic disorders/conditions. Considering this, WHO has initiated a separate agency National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) to validate the efficacy of all the traditional systems of medicine. AYUSH SYSTEMS Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll Role of Hydrotherapy The evidence for the therapeutic uses of water, past and present, showing how ancient Egyptian, Greek, Roman, Celtic and Hebrew societies used water for medicinal purposes, sometimes in conjunction with herbal medicine. Water treatments consisted of hydrotherapy (techniques of therapeutic bathing and use of water), balneotherapy (therapeutic bathing in medicinal and thermal springs) and thalassotherapy (the therapeutic use of ocean bathing and marine products) and these treatments continue to be used to the present day. Hippocrates evidently had an excellent understanding about the physiological properties of water. In the 5th century B.C. Hippocrates wrote about his experiences in using hydrotherapy and one of the most famous Roman hydrotherapy spas is Aquae Sulis built in AD 43. Subsequent to this, in sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there were treatises from Western Europe which documented the use of hydrotherapy. For example 'Kneipp's method'is famous all over Germany for the water treatment modalities mainly propagated by Fr. Sebastian Kneipp. Hydrotherapy is used to treat psychosomatic disorders and also found to have a significant analgesic effect and it does not appear to have noticeable side effects (Shevchuk NA. et al 2008, Michalsen A, et al 2003). There are several animal and human studies shown thermal therapy (Hot Baths) benefit in various life style related disorders such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, dyslipidemia and congestive heart disease (Hooper PL. Et al 1999). Drinking water is beneficial because it acts like an expectorant and can assist in removing sputum (Hannaway, et al 2004). Hydrotherapy, used alone or in combination with other treatments, could be considered as one form of care in providing effective management of the chronic inflammatory dermatoses (Merial-Kieny C, et al 2011). Avene hydrotherapy significantly improved the quality of life of patients suffering from skin diseases (Taieb C, et al 2011). Hydrotherapy may be added a reduction of the adverse gastrointestinal events of NSAIDs, in patients under rheumatology treatments (Queneau P, et al 2011 ). An application of a cold chest pack increases the PEFR as an immediate effect and this effect is augmented following 21 days of other naturopathy treatments along with yoga (NK Manjunath, et al 2006). Complex spa therapy improves psychological factors in patients with bronchial asthma. (Yokota S, et al 1997) The spa therapy showed an improvement in steroid-dependent intractable asthma (SDIA) and therapy showed decreased airway inflammation, improved Ventilatory function, suppression of Bronchial hyper reactivity to methacholine following the Spa therapy. (Y Tanizaki, H Kitani, et al 1993). Role of Fasting Therapy Various studies have been conducted on role of fasting and role of various Naturopathy treatments in the management of different disorders i.e. Diabetes mellitus, Bronchial asthma, Hypertension, AYUSH SYSTEMS Anxiety and Migraine etc. and it is revealed that Naturopathy treatments are found effective in the management of these life style and psychosomatic disorders. Intermittent continuous energy (IER) is as effective as Continuous energy restriction (CER) with regard to weight loss, insulin sensitivity and other health biomarkers, and may be offered as an alternative equivalent to CER for weight loss and reducing disease risk (Harvie MN, et al 2011). Intermittent fasting and Calorie restriction enhance cardiovascular and brain functions and improve several risk factors for coronary artery disease and stroke including a reduction in blood pressure and increased insulin sensitivity (Mattson MP, et al 2005). Chronic intermittent fasting markedly improves the long-term survival after Chronic Heart Failure by activation through its pro- angiogenic, anti-apoptotic and anti-remodeling effects (Katare RJ, et al 2009). Intermittent fasting protects the heart from ischemic injury and attenuates post-MI cardiac remodeling, likely via antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms (Ahmet I, et al 2005). Body mass index and plasma leptin concentrations concomitantly and significantly decreased during fasting, whereas serum orexin-A concentrations significantly increased and were negatively correlated with plasma leptin concentrations in non-obese adults (Komaki G, et al 2001). Fasting affects immune variables such as T cell subsets and natural killer cell activity at least in part through changes in adrenal gland-related hormones (Komaki G, et al 1997). Fasting therapy caused rapid changes in high magnitude in immune and endocrine variables, similar to those that occur during various psychological and environmental stresses (Manuck SB, et al 1991). Role of Massage therapy Studies done on various types of massage with various durations have shown the effect of massage in improving the range of motion in arthritis (Topolska M, et al 2012), peak heart rate, peak VO(2), and peak minute ventilation in Spouses of patients with cancer (Goodfellow LM, et al 2003), and in children received a massage before exercise testing (Beider S, et al 2010). Therapeutic back massage may enhance mood and reduce perceived stress. Studies using slow-stroke back massage and hand massage showed statistically significant improvements on physiological or psychological indicators of relaxation (Harris M, et al 2010). Massage helps to reduce pain, restore normal muscle activity and thus re-establish normal function (Geoffrey C. Goats, et al 1994). 60-minute/week dose of massage therapy in osteo arthritis of knee showed significant improvement in pain as assessed by WOMAC subscales of pain and functionality, as well as the visual analog pain scale (Perlman Al, et al 2012). Swedish massage to daily routines; exercise, diet and medication regimens, is an effective intervention to reduce blood glucose level in diabetic children (Sajedi F, et al 2011).1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI AYUSH SYSTEMS A combined programme of exercise and massage improves arterial blood pressure and ankle brachial index values in type 2 diabetics with peripheral arterial disease (Castro-Sanchez AM, et al 2010). Connective tissue massage improves blood circulation in the lower limbs of type 2 diabetic patients (Castro-Sanchez AM, et al 2011). Massage therapy is a safe, effective, applicable and cost-effective intervention in controlling BP of the prehypertension women and it can be used in the health care centers and even at home (Moeini M, etal2011). Role of Mud therapy Recent article by Rastogi (2012) showed the beneficial effects of mud therapy which plays an effective role in the treatment and management of various disease conditions. Hot mud therapy appears to be indicated for chronic low back pain, stabilized rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and fibromyalgia (Fran?on A, et al 2009). Studies showed that Mud therapy has the most beneficial effect on general and intracardiac hemodynamics, at different temperatures (10, 20-24, and 36 degrees C) in patients with osteoarthrosis and concomitant hypertensive disease and coronary heart disease (L'vova NV, et al 2009). Studies showed that mud-bath therapy significantly improves the clinical conditions of patients with knee osteoarthritis and significantly reduces the frequency and severity of symptoms and the disability they cause (Fraioli A, et al 2009). A combination of daily locally applied mud-packs and bicarbonate-sulphurous mineral bath have shown a significant reduction of the pain and a significant increase of the knee flexion with an improved quality of life (Costantino M, et al 2011). Study has demonstrated that sulphurous mud and bath therapy has induced a significant improvement of overall quality of life with reduction of pain at rest and during daily activities in osteoarthritis (Costantino M, et al 2012). Mud pack and hot pack therapy were both demonstrated to be effective in symptomatic treatment of knee OA until the end of the 2-week treatment period, whereas only mud pack therapy was shown to be effective in functional status over time (Gungen G, et al 2012). Role of Chromo therapy Phototherapy (light therapy) was practiced in ancient Egypt, Greece, China and India. The Egyptians utilized sunlight as well as color for healing (Coclivo A, et al 1999. Research also confirmed that certain parts of the brain are not only light sensitive but actually respond differently to different wavelengths; it is now believed that different wavelengths (colors) of radiation interact differently with the endocrine system to stimulate or reduce hormone production (Peterson A., Et al2001.). The critical review on chromo therapy and its scientific evolution illustrates that the development of science in the field of electromagnetic radiation energy can be very helpful in discovering new dimensions of this old theory. (Samina T et al 2005). Schauss worked on the tranquilizing effect of colors and found that color reduces aggressive behaviour and violence with its effect on the neuroendocrine system which is opening up a new frontier of behavioural technology (AG Schauss, et al 1979).I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I AYUSH SYSTEMS 64 I l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l Role of Magneto therapy Studies shown that the Pulsatile electromagnetic field has an anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect. It causes vasodilatation, myorelaxation, hyper-production of connective tissue and activation of the cell membrane in asthmatic children (Sadlonova J, et al 2003). Pulsed electromagnetic therapy (PEMT) has been proved to be effective in soft tissue injuries in both pain and the range of movement and can be used at home easily in the treatment of patients with neck pain and without side effects. (Foley-Nolan D, et al 1990). Low energy high frequency pulsed electromagnetic therapy for acute whip lash injury (Foley-Nolan D, et al 1992) Role of Naturopathy in the Management of CAD Coronary artery disease is considered to be an important public health problem in developed countries as well as in developing countries such as India. Mortality due to Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is increasing and is a major cause of death all over the world. Asians specially Indians, show increased risk for atherosclerosis and have the highest mortality rates due to CAD amongst all ethnic groups studies so far. Epidemiological studies in India have revealed that the prevalence of CAD has increased from 1.05% in 1960 to about 7.59% in 1990 in the urban population and from 2.03% in 1974 to 3.70% in 1995 in the rural population. It is predicted to assume epidemic proportions by the year 2015 (Enas et al, 1995). Asian Indians residing in different countries have higher rates of incidence, hospitalization, prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and case fatality from CAD than people of other ethnicity (Enas et al, 1996). The CAD rates in urban India over the past 40 years have increased dramatically and are now similar to that of overseas Indians and several times higher than in other Asian countries (Yusuf et al, 1998, Mohan V et al, 2001). Various risk factors contribute to the development of CAD, these risk factors include obesity, hypertension (Brown MJ,2000), uncontrolled diabetes (Kendall DM, 2002: Ninomiya JK, 2004) and abnormal lipid profiles (Pan WH, 1995). With increasing understanding of various risk factors as causative agents of coronary artery disease, lot of interest is generated in prevention and regression of the coronary arterial disease. Though the scientific literature available on Naturopathy in the management of CAD is less, the published articles are concentrated on individual therapies of integrated Naturopathy. These published articles have showed the beneficial effects in reducing the coronary risk factors in CAD and documented the benefits and complications. Leading Naturopathy hospitals/institutions are also using different protocols in the management of CAD. Given the growing domestic and international acceptance of these therapies, it is essential to upgrade the quality of research work. Role of Diet Therapy Majority of the Health initiatives and studies all over the world have focused on improvement of diet, particularly in those with a high risk of cardiovascular diseases. Trials have shown that diets rich in fruits and vegetables reduce blood pressure (Rouse IL, et al) Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. The protective effects of these vegetarian diets have been attributed to the high antioxidant vitamin content. Recently studies have shown that a vegetable Beetroot is responsible AYUSH SYSTEMS Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll for reduction of Blood pressure. Research published in the American Heart Association journal Hypertension showed drinking 500 ml of beetroot juice led to a reduction in blood pressure within one hour. The reduction was more pronounced after three to four hours, and was measurable up to 24 hours after drinking the juice. The effect is attributed to the high nitrate content of the beetroot. The study correlated high nitrate concentrations in the blood following ingestion of the beetroot juice and the drop in blood pressure. Dietary nitrate, such as that found in the beetroot, is thought to be a source for the biological messenger nitric oxide, which is used by the endothelium to signal smooth muscle, triggering it to relax. This induces vasodilation and increased blood flow. Other studies have found the positive effects of beetroot juice on human exercise and performances. In studies conducted by Exeter University, scientists found cyclists who drank a half-litre of beetroot juice several hours before setting off were able to ride up to 20% longer than those who drank a placebo blackcurrant juice. Pomegranate juice is rich in tannins, possesses anti-atherosclerotic properties, has anti-aging effects, and potent anti-oxidative characteristics. As some antioxidants have been shown to reduce blood pressure, Pomegranate juice consumption may reduce systolic blood pressure, inhibits serum ACE activity, and is convincingly a heart-healthy fruit [Aviram M, Domfeld L. Pomegranate juice consumption inhibits serum angiotensin converting enzyme activity and reduces systolic blood pressure. (Stowe CB, et al, 2011).

The roots of this system go to Egypt and its sister civilization Mesopotamia.lt was further adopted by the Arabs, and was developed and improved tremendously by them. The herbal basis of Unani therapy can be traced back to its earliest originators in ancient Egypt who gave primary place to plants in disease treatment. They had also initiated surgery as a method of treatment. The studies of Papyri show the ability of Egyptians in the field of Medicine. Imhotep (2800 BC) and Amenhotep (1550 BC) are some noted physicians of Egyptian period. It was the Greek philosopher-physician Hippocrates (460-370 BC) who freed Medicine from the realm of superstition and magic, and gave it the status of Science. He emphasized the natural causes of disease and recorded the existing medical knowledge to set the grounds for Medicine to develop as a systematic science. The three fundamentals of Hippocratic Medicine were observation, experience, and rational principles, which still remain valid in the field of Medicine and Science. The Alexandrian School ( Madrasa Iskandariyya), established in the third century BC, needs a special mention, for being the first institution to deal with dissection of human body formally. The contribution of Herophilus, Erasistratus and other physicians in the field of Anatomy cannot be ignored. Even today, certain anatomical terms are named after Herophilus. Dioscorides (40-90 AD), who had the tremendous knowledge of medicinal herbs, was the first person to write an illustrated book comprising 600 herbal drugs i.e. De Materia Medica ( Kitab al-Hashaish). Apart from original additions by Dioscorides, the book contained all the previous pharmacological knowledge. The closing years of the creative age of Greece were graced by the great Roman scholar Galen (129-200 AD) stabilized the foundation of this science on which Arab and Persian scholars and physicians like Rabban Tabri (775-890 AD), Al-Razi (865-925 AD) and Ibn Sina (980-1037 AD) developed Unani System of Medicine to great heights. Unani Medicine was introduced to India by the Arabs in the eighth century and soon it took firm roots in the soil and developed as a comprehensive medical system due to multi-pronged original contribution and new applications by scholars of successive generations. It has been practiced, taught and scientifically documented in different parts of the country and flourished as a scientific medical system. The Delhi Sultans, the Khiljis, the Tughlaqs and the Mughal Emperors provided state patronage to the scholars and even enrolled some as state employees and court physicians. During the 13th and 17th century, Unani Medicine had its heyday in India. Among those who made valuable contributions to this system in the period were, to name only a few, Abu Bakr bin Ali Usman Kashani, Sadruddin Dimashqui, Bahwa and Mohammad Hashim Alvi Khan. The continuing creativity of Indian scholars of Unani System of Medicine is testified by the emergence of the encyclopedic author Uakem A'zam Khan (1813-1902 AD) in the nineteenth century, who is well known for his outstanding works in the areas1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI 81 AYUSH SYSTEMS Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll of Medicine and Pharmacology viz.

It was mainly the Sharifi Family in Delhi, the Azizi Family in Lucknow and the Nizam of Hyderabad due to whose efforts Unani Medicine survived in the British period. An outstanding physician and scholar of Unani Medicine, Hakim Azam Khan (1815-1902 AD) and Hakim Ajmal Khan (1868 -1927) championed the cause of Unani System of Medicine in India. The Hindustani Dawakhana and the Ayurvedic and Unani Tibbia College in Delhi are the two living examples of his immense contribution to the multipronged development of the two Indian systems of medicine - Unani Medicine and Ayurveda. The Majeedi family of Delhi, especially Hakim Abdul Hameed (1908-1999), made valuable contribution towards modernization of Unani drug industry. Hakim Abdul Hameed also established an Institute of History of Medicine and Medical Research (IHMMR) in New Delhi that developed into a deemed university- the Jamia Hamdard in 1989. During the British rule, Unani Medicine suffered a setback, but since the system enjoyed faith among the masses, it continued to be practiced. The development of Unani Medicine as well as other Indian systems of medicine gained considerable momentum after independence. The Government of India facilitated the growth and development of Unani Medicine by recognizing its utility and scope and integrated it into healthcare delivery system. With its wide network of quality educational institutions, comprehensive healthcare facilities, state of the art research institutions and quality drug manufacturing industries and on account of its utilization by a large number of people for their healthcare needs, India has emerged as the global leader in Unani Medicine. A Health Survey and Development Committee appointed in the year 1943 underscored the future role to be played by the indigenous systems of medicine of India. In 1946, the conference of health ministers resolved that adequate provisions should be made at the Centre and provinces for research in indigenous systems of medicine, Ayurveda and Unani. Initially, the Indian Systems of Medicine and Homoeopathy (ISM&H) were taken care of by a division within the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. In March 1995, it was replaced by a full-fledged Department of Indian Systems of Medicine and Homoeopathy in the ministry, which was renamed as Department of AYUSH in November, 2003 for overall development of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy. With the aim of providing focused attention to the development of education and research in AYUSH systems of medicine, the Department of AYUSH has been elevated to a full-fledged Ministry of AYUSH with effect from 09 November, 2014.

The dissolution of CCRIMH in 1978 to accord focused attention for research in individual systems led to setting up of four separate research councils - one each for Ayurveda & Siddha, Unani Medicine, Yoga & Naturopathy, and Homoeopathy. The Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine (CCRUM) started functioning from 10th January 1979 as an autonomous organization. The main objectives of the Council are as follows: Formulation of aims and patterns of research on scientific lines in Unani Medicine To undertake research or any other programmes in Unani Medicine Prosecution of and assistance in research and propagation of knowledge and experimental measures generally in connection with the causation, mode of spread and prevention of diseases To initiate, aid, develop and coordinate scientific research on different aspects, fundamental and applied, of Unani Medicine, and to promote and assist institutions of research for the study of diseases, their prevention, causation and remedy To finance enquiries and researches for the furtherance of objectives of the Council To exchange information with other institutions, associations and societies interested in the objectives similar to those of the Council, especially in the observation and study of diseases in the East in general, and in India in particular To prepare, print, publish and exhibit any papers, posters, pamphlets, periodicals and books for furtherance of the objectives of the Council and to contribute to such literature The policies, directions and overall functioning of the Council are regulated by the Governing Body. Minister of State (Independent Charge), Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India is the president of the Governing Body and has general control on the affairs of the Council. There is a Standing Finance Committee (SFC) under the chairmanship of Joint Secretary, Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India to consider and recommend various financial proposals, developmental activities, etc. The Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC), headed by an expert of Unani Medicine as its chairman and reputed scientists in different disciplines as members of the committee, provides direction to the research activities. The SAC helps the Council in formulation, appraisal, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the research projects and identify topics of research for the development of the system. Sub-committees, e.g. clinical research subcommittee, drug research subcommittee, literary research subcommittee, survey and cultivation of medicinal plants and claim for cure subcommittee have also been constituted for assisting SAC. A committee for claim-of-cure has been constituted to examine the claim for treatment of various diseases. Local scientific advisory committees have also been constituted for the close monitoring of the research activities of the institutes. In accordance with the standard guidelines to look into the ethical issues involved in research studies undertaken by the Council, the Institutional Ethics Committees (IECs) have been constituted in all the clinical research institutes/centers of the Council. The Council has its headquarters at New Delhi with 23 centers functioning in different parts of the country. The institutional network of the Council includes two Central Research Institutes of Unani Medicine (CRIUMs) - one each at Hyderabad and Lucknow; eight Regional Research Institutes of Unani Medicine (RRIUMs) - one each at Chennai, Bhadrak, Patna, New Delhi, 83 AYUSH SYSTEMS Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll Mumbai, Kolkata, Aligarh and Srinagar; two Regional Research Centres (RRCs) - one each at Allahabad and Silchar; six Clinical Research Units (CRUs) - Burhanpur, Meerut, Bengaluru, Kumool and Edathala; Hakim Ajmal Khan for Literary & Historical Research in Unani Medicine (HAKILHRUM) at New Delhi; Drug Standardization Research Institute (DSRI) at Ghaziabad; Drug Standardization Research Unit (DSRU) at New Delhi; Chemical Research Unit (Grant-in-aid) at Aligarh; and Clinical Research Pilot Project at Imphal, Manipur.

Despite a few common dimensions, the systems have a different method of diagnosis and principles of treatment. Therefore thesystems can be used together according to their strength areas. The Strategies for Intra-AYUSH collaboration under the clinical / pharmacological research programmes can be explored in following ways: - i) Unani medicine as standard therapy/ adjuvant therapy in the management of diseases where leads have already been achieved or there is strong documented literary evidence ii) Unani regimenal therapies like Hijamah Bath), Kai (Cauterisation), Riyazat (Exercise) etc can be used with drug therapies of other systems iii) Sharing of infrastructure and facilities among AYUSH Unani medicine as standard therapy/ adjuvant therapy in the management of diseases where leads have already been achieved or there is strong documented literary evidence The Unani medicine can be used as a standalone therapy for the management of various disorders which have proved safe and efficacious through preclinical and clinical studies carried out New Investigational Drugs conducted at various institutes of the council as under: Vitiligo {Baras) The Council has conducted extensive multi-centric clinical studies on various Unani formulations in 45,885 patients of various types of Vitiligo mainly at CRIUM, ongoing in Dept of Dermatology, AIIMS, in New Delhi on efficacy and safety of coded Unani drug in management of Vitiligo. Besides publishing a number of research papers, the Council has brought out two monographs on Vitiligo: Clinical Studies on Baras (Da al-Sadaf) Different combinations of Unani formulations have been studied to evaluate their efficacy in 4,584 patients of eczema and in 971 patients of psoriasis in four clinical research units of the Council. A clinical study on coded Unani drugs UNIM-401 (0)+ UNIM 403 (L) mushil therapy in Da-al-Sadaf (Psoriasis) patients\" has been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Unani drug. A publication entitled \"Success Story on Eczema and Psoriasis\" has been brought out by the Council. 99 AYUSH SYSTEMS ^Illlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll iii. Rheumatoid Arthritis ( Waja' al-Mafasil) Clinical and therapeutic studies were conducted at eight centres of the Council on a combination of two Unani drugs used orally and locally on 8000 patients of Rheumatoid Arthritis. The efficacy of the treatment further enhanced when concoctive (Munzij) and purgative ( Mushil) drugs were used before treatment with the above regimens. The outcome of the study has been published by the Council in the form of a booklet entitled \"Unani Treatment for Waja ul Mafasil (Rheumatoid Asthma (Zeeq al-Nafas ) Studies to evaluate the therapeutic effects of Unani formulations were conducted on 2700 patients of Bronchial asthma at two regional centres of the Council. The outcome has been published in the form of a monograph. v. Chronic Sinusitis ( Waram Tajawif al- A naf Muzmin) Therapeutic efficacy of two Unani formulations was evaluated in 4974 patients of Sinusitis at Central Research Institute of Unani Medicine (CRIUM), Hyderabad. The outcome of the study has been published by the Council in the form of a booklet entitled \"Clinical study of Polyherbal Unani formulations in Waram Tajawif vi. ( Ziyabetus Sukkari) Clinical trials on a Unani formulation were conducted in 240 patients of type-II Diabetes mellitus at CRIUM, Kasrat-i al-Dam) A clinical study was conducted on a Unani drug in 98 cases of Hyperlipidaemia at CRIUM, Hyderabad. The formulation showed significant effect in decreasing the Serum Cholesterol, Triglycerides, and LDL levels. Vector borne disease- Leads have been achieved in vector borne diseases as the Council intervened in the area of vector borne diseases by conducting observational studies on the efficacy of some Unani drugs diseases such as; Humma-e-Ijamia (Malaria), Daul Feel (Filariasis) and Humma-e-Aswad (Kala Azar) through its different research centers. The Council conducted therapeutic trials of two coded Unani drugs UNIM-151 and UNIM-152 in cases of Malaria at its research centers. Therapeutic trials of coded drugs UNIM-251 and UNIM-254 were conducted in cases of lymphatic filariasis at the Council's research centers located at Chennai. On the basis of the concept of the disease available in the Unani classics the Council formulated a combination of drugs for trial in cases of Kala-Azar at Regional Research Institute of Unani Medicine, Patna. The Council formulated a combination of some Unani drugs such as; Majoon-e-chobchini and capsule Musqffi which are immune-modulatory and Melanogauge in nature respectively for oral AYUSH SYSTEMS 1 0 0 Illlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll use along with local application of Raughan-e-Surkh which is anti-inflammatory, analgesic and muscles relaxant. This combination of the drugs was given to 585 patients attending the special health camps organized by Central Research Institute of Unani Medicine, Hyderabad during the outbreak of Chikungunya in May to July 2006. Cognitive impairment- Unani formulations are known for their active role in the management of cognitive impairment like dementia and amnesia. Formulations like Khameera Abresham and various single drugs have proven efficacy in the cognitive impairment at clinical as well pre- clinical studies. The adjuvant therapies are mainly used either to enhance the efficacy of main drug for the management of disease or to reduce or minimize the side effect of the drug used for the same. Unani medicine can play a role in adjuvant therapy for its hepato-protective, nephro-protective and neuro- protective action proven on the basis of use since ages and also on scientific parameters. Council has allotted new project to evaluate the experimental studies on the hepato-protective and immune- modulatory effects of Unani formulations at its cellular and molecular mechanism. Also to elaborate the anti-cancer potential of Unani phamacopoeal formulation and to explore the effect of Unani single drugs on human cancer cell lines. These drugs are also being evaluated on scientific parameters in various clinical studies conducted other than council for evaluation of their hepato\u00ad protective, neuro-protective and nephro-protective action. Also, drugs are familiar for unique holistic approach, they could be used as adjuvant in management of various debilitating disorders like Cancer, HIV, Tuberculosis etc., as the treatment of such disorders are associated with severe side effects. Recently, the council has initiated two such projects in collaboration with ICMR on tuberculosis (at RRIUM Chennai with NIRT, Chennai) and erosion (at Bath), Kai (Cauterisation), Riyazat (Exercise) etc can be used with drug therapies of other systems The unani regimenal therapies like Hijamah Bath), Kai (Cauterisation), Riyazat (Exercise) etc could be used as adjuvant as well standard therapy for the treatment pf various diseases. AYUSH SYSTEMS Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll The council is conducting Regimenal therapy OPD/IPDs at the various institutes of the council with promising results. The council's scientists have also initiated a few projects based on regimenal therapy at RRIUM Chennai and Patna. Regimenal therapy units are being developed at CRIUM lucknow and RRIUM Chennai for further exploring the full potential of these therapies. Much progress has been made in exploring potential of Unani Medicine for strengthening Primary Health Care programmes by way of co-location. There is, however, room for further improving these efforts, particularly in terms of integrating traditional and Intra-AYUSH collaboration into the public health programmes and development of reliable information on the most commonly used traditional therapies, based on results from clinical studies and other scientific studies. Sharing of infrastructure and facilities among AYUSH All Research Councils of AYUSH system have their institutes/units established all over India. However, there is virtually no interface within the Research Councils. It is the need of the hour to bring all systems together for collaboration in research in the interest of health for all. The infrastructure and facilities available in different centres of Research Councils can be utilized on sharing basis. Some special infrastructures available with Institutes of CCRUM that can be shared with other AYUSH Councils is mentioned below- Facilities available at Central Regional Institute Hyderabad- > > > > > > > > > AYUSH SYSTEMSPhysiology Lab Micro-biology Lab Cell and Molecular Biology Lab Drug Standardization Research Unit Pharmacological Studies Survey and Cultivation of Medicinal Plants Units Mobile Clinical Research Unit with Radiology, Statistics and Medical Record sections Licensed animal house Herbal Garden Illlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll Facilities available at Regional Research Institute Chennai- > Mobile clinical research unit, SCSP & SRPP > Ilaj bit Tadbeer unit (Regimental Therapy unit) > Chemistry department (Drug Standardisation) > Pharmacognosy section > Microbiology section > Botany department (Survey of medicinal plants) > Radiology section > Statistics section > Library section > Pharmacy section Facilities available at Regional Research Institute Sri Nagar- > Phytochemistry Lab > Toxicology Lab > Histopathology lab > Animal Holding House The CCRUM may explore Intra-Council Collaboration with the Institutes/Units of other Research Councils either at same place or in its vicinity.

It is considered the mother medicine of ancient Tamils / Dravidians in South India which flourished during the Indus valley civilisation period. Siddha literature focuses on diverse topics like science of life, drugs, kayakalpam, anatomy, physiology, pathology, diagnostic parameters, surgery, alchemy, astrology, atomic theory and space travel. The Healing Dimension revealed by the Siddhars with highly systematized technology is 'Siddha medicine'. The evolution of Siddha system is believed to date back 10000-4000 BC. The Siddha system provides preventive, promotive, curative, rejuvenative and rehabilitative health care with holistic approach. Siddha system is said to be divine and holistic system of medicine as it offers excellent medicines and lifestyle guidelines for healthy living. \"Siddha system\" is a unique system of medicine as it is both medicinally and spiritually enriched. Siddha heritage is invaluable as it helps to acquire health for physique, peace for mind and purity for the The word 'Siddha' is derived from the root word 'Citti', which means attaining perfection, heavenly bliss and accomplishment in life arts such as philosophy, yoga, wisdom, alchemy, medicine and above all the art of longevity. The Siddha system comprises essentially of philosophical concepts including the four main components: 1. Iatro-chemistry, 2. Medical practice, 3. Yogic practice and 4. Wisdom Siddha system is named after the founders called 'Siddhars' who explored and explained the reality of nature and its relationship to man by their yogic awareness and experimental findings. Siddhar Agasthiyar is called the Father of Siddha Medicine. Siddhars are the enlightened scientists who attained perfection physically, mentally, intellectually and spiritually and their yogic powers enabled them to explore the world around them and they utilised its natural resources for the sake of humanity through Siddha system of medicine. They practiced the eight kinds of yogam (Attanga yogam) and did great miracles Thirumoolar, Yugi, Theraiyar, Bogar, Pulippani and Nagamuni are some of the Siddhars who have significantly contributed for the growth of Siddha system. Siddha is popular in the treatment of acute and chronic ailments like arthritis, respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus, obesity, hyperlipidaemia, neurological conditions like hemiplegia, paraplegia, Parkinsonism, muscular disorders, digestive disorders, skin diseases including psoriasis and vitiligo, and gynaecological disorders are also successfully managed in Siddha system.1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI 107 AYUSH SYSTEMS Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll Basic principles and Fundamental aspects of Siddha system Siddha system is a psychosomatic system of medicine that deals with the relationship between the mind and body and aims at maintaining the physical, mental and moral health of an individual. The Siddha system is evolved based on ninety-six tools or principles (Thathuvas) which include physical, physiological, psychological and intellectual aspects of every human being. According to the Siddha system, matter and energy are the two major entities, which account for the formation of the Universe and its contents. They are called Siva and Sakthi in the Siddha system. Matter cannot exist without energy and vice-versa. Relation between Microcosm and Macrocosm Man is said to be the microcosm and the Universe, the macrocosm; what exists in the Universe also exists in man. Hence, man must be looked upon as an integral part of the Universe. Further, the matters in the microcosm or man are identical with those of the macrocosm or the Universe. Pancha Bhootham The universe is made up of the five primordial elements called bhoothams (elements) namely Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Space. That is, they are Mann (solid), Neer (fluid), Thee (radiance), Vayu (gas) and Aagayam (ether). These subtle components combine in various proportions to form gross substances. This manifestation is explained as They are vaatham, pitham and kabham which are responsible for the creation, preservation and destruction of the human body and health. When they are in the state of equilibrium (4:2:1-the ratio in which they exist) our body remains in a healthy state while any alteration in this ratio leads to a diseased state or death. In each and every cell of the body these three kutrams (doshas) coexist and function harmoniously. Vali (Creative force) - Represents the elements 'air' and 'space'. It is responsible for all the movements of the body. Motor and sensory activities are said to be governed by vaatham. Azhal (Sustaining force) - Represents the element-'fire' in our body and is responsible for the preservation of health. It helps in digestion, blood cell production, maintenance of body temperature, intellect and vision, lustre to the skin Aiyam (Destructive/ Eliminating force)- Formed by the elements 'earth and water'. It is responsible for Strength and stability of the body structures, supports the functions of respiration, appreciation of taste, cooling of eyes, function of digestion, lubricating joints. (Destructive/ Eliminating force) Udal Thathukkal (Body Constituents) From the subtle elements, gross structures like bone, muscle, fat etc. i.e. the physical constituents of human beings develop which are identical to the various types of tissues and are AYUSH SYSTEMS Illlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll called Udal Thathukkal (Body Constituents). As per Siddha medicine various psychological and physiological functions of the body are attributed to seven physical constituents. 1. Saram (Digestive juice). Saram means Prana vayu (Oxygen) responsible for growth, development and nourishment; 2. Seneer (blood) is responsible for nourishing muscles, imparting color and improving intellect; 3. Oon (muscle) responsible for shape of the body; 4. Kollzuppu (fatty tissue) responsible for lubricating joints; 5. Enbu (bone) responsible for body structure, posture and movement; 6. Moolai (Bone marrow) - responsible for the production of RBC, etc. 7. Sukilam / Sronitham (semen) responsible for reproduction. Diagnosis The Siddha diagnostic methodology is based on the clinical examination by the physician and these diagnostic tools are very important because they assist in diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. Siddha physicians base their diagnosis on three humors (Mukkuttram) and eight vital tests (Ennvagai Thervu) reading, (Naadi - Examination of the tongue (Naa) Complexion of body, (Niram) Study of voice, (Mozhi - Kural) Examination of eyes, (vizhi) Urine examination, (Neer kuri & Neikuri) Examination of faeces, (Malam) Status of the sensation of human body (Sparism). Among these, urine examination (Neerkuri and Neikkuri) is a unique diagnostic method. The color of the urine, smell, density, quantity and froth are noted and Neikkuri is a method, in which the surface tension and the pattern of gingelly oil spreading on the surface of the urine provide clues in diagnosis as well as prognosis of the disease. Wrist Circumferential Sign (Manikkadai Nool) In Siddha system, apart from the eight investigatory tools of diagnosis described above, the measurement of wrist circumference by an inelastic thread expressed in terms of four finger-breadth (excluding thumb) of the patient forms another diagnostic tool called Manikkadai nooLA standard inelastic thread is used to measure the wrist circumference of every patient and the same is compared with the list of diseases and health chart mentioned in classical literature of Siddha. Siddha Treatment Principles The treatment in Siddha system is aimed at keeping the three vital life factors in equilibrium and in the maintenance of the seven body thathus. Therefore, proper diet, medicine and a AYUSH SYSTEMS disciplined regimen of life are advised for a healthy living and to restore equilibrium of humors in a diseased condition. The main principle in treating diseases through Siddha system is by normalizing the altered vital life factors (mukuttram). Therapeutic purgation collyrium normalizes the Aiyam. There are three types of treatment strategies \u2014 i) Synergistic method (Oppurai), ii) Antagonistic method (Ethirurai) and iii) Mixed method (Kalappurai). Siddha Materia Medica: The classical text Thirumantiram defines Siddha medicine as the one that cures physical and mental ailments, prevents diseases and the one that ensures Thirumoolar In Siddha system there are three main sources of drugs origin which find their use in several single drugs / formulations of internal and external medications. These Siddha medicines help in the regeneration and longevity of cells and thus speeding up the restoration of normal health. For treating particular diseases, the specific characters like taste (Suvai), quality (Gunam), potency (Veeryam), post-digestive taste (Pirivu), and specific action (Prabhavam) of the drugs are considered. Three major sources of Siddha medicines are: Plant origin (Mooligai/Thavaram vaguppu) - root, stem, leaf, flower, resin, gum, seeds, bark and fruits are used in multiple preparations Inorganic substances (Thathu vaguppu) - metals and minerals Metals like gold (thangam), silver (velli), copper (chembu), iron (logam), Tin (vel vangam), magnet (kaantham) Rasam (mercury) and its different forms like red sulphide of mercury, Chlorides of mercury and red oxide of (nandukkal)I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I AYUSH SYSTEMS 1 1 0 Illlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll sea rocks), sal ammoniac (navacharum). Animal products (Jeeva vaguppu) Marine products, egg shells of birds, kizhijal, conch shell (sangu), crab shell (nandu oodu), fresh water shell (nathai odu), egg shell (muttai odu) are being used after proper purification and processing techniques. Siddha medicines with long shelf life such as parpam (calcinated), red oxide (chenduram) or chunnam form with higher efficacy, smaller dosage, easy palatability, long shelf life, easy absorption and sustainable quicker results with lower drug dosage for multiple disease treatment through variable adjuvants. The processed Siddha formulations comprising nano particles aid in better bio- availability and bio-equivalence. Purification Process (sutthi) Raw drugs of animal, mineral and herbal origin are subjected to purification before they are added in the preparation of medicines. Purification helps in detoxification and enhancing the potency. Classification of Siddha medicine: Siddha has an extensive history of scientific background. Siddhar's knowledge of minerals and metals and their suitable combination for preparation of medicines according to laws of nature is miraculous. Siddha system classified medications into 64 pharmaceutical forms (Dosage forms) of which 32 are internal medications and 32 are external medication and treatment procedures. Internal medicines (Aga Marundugal) - based on their forms, methods of preparation, shelf-life, etc, they are administered through the oral route. Dosage form: Some unique drugs like Kattu are prepared by a process where the mercurial and the arsenic compounds, which are volatile, are converted into non-volatile form by adding dravagam, cheyaneer, leaf juice, honey etc., Chunnam is prepared by heating or calcining a metal / mineral / animal product to convert it into a calx as per the procedure mentioned in the recipe. They possess alkaline properties similar to that of limestone. When treated with a pinch of turmeric powder chunnam turns red. AYUSH SYSTEMS Gurukuligai is prepared by the transformation of sublime mercury into beads in its amalgam form. Mercury could be called the sheet anchor of Siddha therapeutics. These mercurial pills possess marvellous properties of transmuting metals and rejuvenating the entire human system. External medicines (Pura marundugal) - Certain forms of drugs and also external applications like nasal, eye and ear drops and procedures like leech done by rubbing the body with horse gram flour or turmeric powder with or without camphor. Attai-vidal is done by Leech application to locally affected areas with block or swelling. Murichal and Kombu kattal is useful for bone setting and it is a process of physical manipulation by which dislocated bone or joint are brought to their normal position. Branches of Siddha Medicine Siddha system of medicine has various branches such as Pharmacology (Gunapadam), Toxicology (Nanju Maruthuvam), Pathology (Noi Maruthuvam deals with diseases, their aetiology, classification, signs and symptoms, complications, prognosis and treatment. It also suggests dietary pattern and restrictions. Siddha Pharmacology (Gunapadam) deals with raw drugs of plants, minerals and substances of animal origin, their purification, methods of preparation of medicines and their therapeutic usages with appropriate doses. Siddha Surgery (Aruvai Maruthuvam) deals with surgical procedures such as Kaaram (use of Kaara seelai i.e. medicated gauze or Kaara nool i.e medicated thread), Cautery or Scorching techniques (suttigai), Bone setting consisting of Reduction (Murichal) and Splinting (Kompu Kattal) i.e. therapeutic Incision, Leech therapy (attai vidal ) etc. calculi, filariasis, fistula-in-ano, hernia, ophthalmic, ENT and dental diseases. Ancient methods of surgically treating cataract and pterygium and prevention of eye diseases are also highlighted. Siddha Pathology (Noi Nadal) deals with diagnosis of diseases.I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I AYUSH SYSTEMS 1 1 2 Siddha Toxicology (Nanju Maruthuvam) deals with toxic conditions, toxic effects of drugs of plant, mineral and animal origin and the poisonous effects of animal bites, insect stings etc. and their management. It also deals with antidotes, synthetic drugs (Vaippu sarakku) Siddha Obstetrics (Sool Maruthuvam) deals diseases. Siddha Gynaecology (Magalir Maruthuvam) deals with conditions associated with menstrual irregularities, female infertility, inflammatory diseases and cancers of female uro-genital tract. Siddha Paediatrics (Balavagadam) deals with diseases of children including the newborn and their management. Kaya karpam Kaya karpam called Rejuvenation Elixir in Siddha medicine helps to keep the body as strong as stone; Siddhars have developed kayakarpam for prevention, treatment of ailments and to maintain healthy long life. Kayakarpam is the process of rejuvenation which helps in health promotion, memory, intelligence, youthful feeling and consciousness. According to Siddha Materia Medica, Kayakarpam medicines include single herbs or formulations involving minerals and animal kingdom. Kayakarpam drugs have been classified into general (pothu) karpam which are indicated for optimum health, longevity and beauty and special (Sirappu) karpam indicated during the period of illness and physical imbalance. External Therapies Certain special therapies/external therapy techniques such as Pressure Manipulation Therapy (Varmam), Physical Manipulation Therapy (Thokkanam), Bone setting (Otivu there in Siddha system. Siddhar Yogam Yogam is a precious art and part of Siddha system of medicine for the benefit of human kind. The term 'Yogam' means 'Union'. Siddhars have defined Yogam as an art, which controls the mind by preventing it from distracting through sense and sense organs and unite it with the divinity after realizing the true entity of eternal bliss. 'Yogam' is one of the Kayakarpam methods that preserve physical and mental health by preventing the approach of grey hair, wrinkling, disease and death. Thirumoolar's Tirumantiram deals elaborately with Attanga yogam i.e. the purity of mind Niyamam - Purity of action1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI 113 AYUSH SYSTEMS Asanam - posture or pose, Pranayamam - scientific art of controlling one's breathing Prathiyaharam- practice of controlling or withdrawing of senses Dharanai - concentration or fixation of the mind Dhiyanam- art of gaining complete control over (mastering) the mind Samathi- attaining the state equal to God Selection of food according to the landscape where one lives, the climate one is exposed to and the lifestyle one adopts are essential for a healthy life. Dietetics and Nutrition in Siddha: 'Food itself is medicine and medicine itself is food' is one of the basic principles of Siddha system of medicine. Food, climate, landscape and lifestyle are the major factors that influence healthy life. Imbalance in the state of the three vital life factors will lead to disease and therefore emphasis is laid on a balanced diet to keep the three vital life factors in a balanced state. According to Siddha, the consumption of food should be in proportion to a person's appetite. In Siddha system of medicine, food has been categorized into three types, i.e. the food that promotes noble qualities (sathuvam), the food that promotes energetic (active) qualities (rasatham) and the food that promotes inert qualities (Tamasam). Lifestyle Management Siddhars have recommended certain basic lifestyle guidelines to be followed for healthy living and they include observation of certain regimen as mentioned in preventive measures (pinianugaa vithi) that help to prevent diseases. The concept of rejuvenating procedures for prevention of diseases is highly admirable as it increases our immunity. The concepts pertaining to habitat, seasons, diet etc. are easily adaptable preventive measures for a disease - free life. Do's Drink warm water after boiling. Take food twice a day. Take diluted buttermilk and melted ghee. Take sufficient quantity of cow's milk. Always have food to the level of hunger. Always consume well-fermented curd. Practice short walking after food. Have therapeutic emesis once in six months. Have therapeutic purgation once in four months. Instill nasal drops once in 45 days. Take oil bath (applying oil all over the body and scalp and taking bath) once every four days.I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I AYUSH SYSTEMS 114 Use warm water while taking oil bath.

Worship cow, God, ancestors and teachers Don'ts Never eat root tubers except yam - Typhonium trilobatum (L.) Schott. Never consume food that was prepared the previous day. Don't drink water during the course of a meal. Avoid sleep during daytime. Avoid excessive sexual indulgence. Avoid sex after consumption of heavy food. Never smell fragrant flowers during midnight. Never lie close to articles producing dust. Never sleep under a tree or near a burning lamp during night. Never suppress any natural urge. The above instructions when followed carefully promote longevity. Daily regimen (Naal ozhukkam): Daily regimen enumerates the systematic order of everyday activities that every person needs to follow in order to avoid lifestyle disorders. It describes the procedure to be followed and materials to be used for taking good care of our body and mind from rising from bed till retiring to bed (oral hygiene, excretion of urine and stools, bathing methods, oil bath, dress materials for men and women, sleeping methods and bed materials) Concepts regarding Habitat and Season: Siddha science, which visualizes man as a microcosm, believes that planetary changes and natural rhythms that occur in six seasons of a year (Perumpozhuthu) and six periods of a day (sirupozhuthu) produce corresponding physiological changes in living beings in the macrocosm, viz., the Universe. The geographical regions are classified as hilly mountains, forest, agrarian, coastal and desertified regions. Disease pattern is also based on these geo-climatic zones. Siddha system recommends specific life style and food habits for each geo-climatic zone based on the natural resources available in that region. 10.2.

AYUSH SYSTEMS 138 Illlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll CHAPTER -12 Specific areas of Strength of Siddha for Intra-AYUSH Collaboration The strength of the Siddha medical system lies in its holistic approach for a healthy living. The healing science encompasses the physical, mental, social and spiritual well being by adapting simple lifestyle practices, dietary regimens, safe and effective drugs of vegetable, mineral and from substances of animal origin. The focus has all along been on preventive, promotive and rejuvenative methods for maintaining good health, defying ageing and curative procedures including cleansing therapies and external therapies. Varmam Therapy Varmam therapy is the pressure manipulation on prescribed Varmam points with a specific force for the specified time. This therapy will normalize the course of pranic energy that is clogged due to attack on Varmam points and any other causes. The principle is to regulate the flow of Varmam energy. The various methods of Varmam treatment are classified as follows: 1. Energy based treatment 2. Vital air based treatment 3. Nervous system based treatment 4. Bone based treatment 5. Muscle based treatment 6. Internal organ based treatment The aforesaid therapeutic procedures have to be suitably chosen and manipulated by well- trained Varmam experts. When a person gets hurt in the Varmam point and becomes unconscious and if he is not revived within the specified time, complications may follow including fatality. So, it is vital to resuscitate (Illaku murai) the person with pressure manipulation therapy (Varmam therapy) immediately. This unique science and art of Varmam is largely practised in Southern parts of India particularly in Tamil Nadu and South Kerala. The expert in Varmam technique is called 'Varmam' and he teaches this skill to new individual only after examining his character\u2014 whether he has noble (Cattuvam) qualities or not. So that is why Varmam is also known as Marmam that means secret. Many classical literatures are available in the field of Varmam. The study of Varmam comprises location of Varmam points, signs and symptoms of Varmam assault, application of techniques for releasing affected Varmam (Illaku murai), manipulation over the vital Varmam points (Attankal), etc. In addition, if the patient is unconscious the study of Varmam also includes application of the external therapies such as nasal drops (Naciyam), and ear drops and internal medicines with herbs and dietary regimen pertaining to Varmam manipulation. AYUSH SYSTEMS Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll Therapeutic benefits of Varmam: Varmam therapy is useful in the treatment of neuro-musculo- skeletal disorders and joint disorders. 1. Cervical spondylosis 2. Lumbar spondylosis 3. Osteoarthritis 4. Hemiplegia 5. Paraplegia 6. Sciatica 7. Peripheral neuropathy, etc. Physical Manipulation Therapy (Thokkanam) It is one of the distinctive external treatment procedures of Siddha system of medicine where therapeutic manipulation is performed in specified parts or all over the body with or without the use of oil. It (Thokkanam) is a procedure normally consisting of striking and pressing with fist and then pressing the affected part of body part/s. Types of Thokkanam: Thokkanam is of Thokkanam: Thokkanam nurtures the body cells, improves sleep and sexual function; relieves body pain, tiredness and expels gas. Thokkanam tones up skin, muscles and nerves, improves blood circulation and facilitates lymphatic drainage. Thokkanam is useful in treating diseases of neuro- muscular and musculo -skeletal systems. Thokkanam is also useful in treating Azhal and Aiyam diseases. Thokkanam, by normalising the altered Vali, helps in rejuvenation and rehabilitation. Hemiplegia, paraplegia, muscle weakness, dystrophies, sciatica, cervical and lumbar spondylosis are some of the neuromuscular and joint disorders treated by Thokkanam. Bone setting (Odivu Murivu Maruthuvam) Bone setting (Odivu Murivu) is one of the specialties in Siddha medicine. In spite of the developments in modem medicine, it is practised effectively by Siddha physicians. Bone Setting Treatment involves the following specialized procedures viz. Reduction (Murichal) \u2014 Diagnosis by just touching the affected part with fingers and thereafter reduction of fracture by different methods. Splinting (Kompukattal) \u2014 Immobilization by traditional bamboo splints. Traditional medicated cloth bandages prepared using egg white, black gram powder, pounded rice, tamarind seeds, Shorea robusta (Sal resin), Cassia occidentalis (Coffee senna), etc. External specific etc., to reduce pain, swelling and facilitate rapid union of fractured bones. Specific internal medicines like Varmaani Kuligai, Varma Nei, Kaya Thirumeni Thailam etc., are prescribed along with the above procedures. The powder of Cissus quadrangularis L. (Bone-setter plant) with milk, which has a proven efficacy in rapid union of fractures. External medications and Treatment procedures - Puramaruthuvam (External Therapies) External medications deal with medications and treatment procedures used both as a mainstream therapy or supportive therapy. These include minor surgical procedures and are done either as curative or prophylactic. This forms an important part of Siddha system as it ensures good results with no side effects. There are 32 external therapies mentioned in Siddha literatures. Recently External therapies are gaining importance because of their immediate therapeutic effects. 1.

In addition, Tamil Nadu Government has issued orders to dispense Nilavembu Kudineer (Official Siddha Formulation) in the primary, secondary and territory institutes and medical colleges under Government of Tamil Nadu. (a) \"Multi-centric open labelled non-randomized hospital based two-year/two-season parallel group, Phase III/IV clinical trial to compare the efficacy of Siddha, Ayurveda and Homoeopathy formulations in alleviating the arthralgia pains in post-infective Dengue/Chikungunya in urban Delhi population\" in collaboration with Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi. (b) A joint proposal/protocol has been prepared for collaboration with ICMR- National Institute of Epidemiology (NIE) to establish the efficacy of Siddha formulations in the treatment of Dengue. Preclinical Studies on Nilavembu Kudineer In-vitro Studies: The Central Council for Research in Siddha in collaboration with the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) recently studied the anti-viral effects of Nilavembu Kudineer on (NVK) human dose). At 0.0245% of human dose, marginal cytotoxicity was observed when Nilavembu was used as a single drug as opposed to no toxicity in NVK, a poly herbal formulation. NVK was non-toxic even at 3.1% of human dose while NV showed more of 80% death of cells at this concentration. Based on this, further studies were done only on NVK. Alcoholic extract of NVK showed antiviral effect (>50%) on macrophages during pre treament at a concentration of 0.098% of human dose. In co-incubation, the cells were protected from DENV at a concentration of 0.078% of human dose. In case of post\u00ad treatment, the drug did not produce any protective effect on the cells. The formulation worked best in macrophages and did not show protective effect on kidney and epithelial cells, showing the specificity of drug effect. Alcoholic extract of NVK was most effective against DENV if given as a prophylaxis treatment or when co-incubated with the virus. Safety / Toxicity Studies: The oral administration of Ethanolic extract of Nilavembu kudineer chooranam (EENKC) at the dose 2000 mg/kg did not exhibit any signs of toxicity up to 14 days and no mortality was observed. This indicates that EENKC was nontoxic in mice up to an oral dose of 2000 mg/kg of body weight. Therefore, the biological evaluation was carried out using 200 and 400 mg/kg dose levels. Antipyretic, Analgesic and Anti-inflammatory activities: Nilavembu kudineer showed significant anti-inflammatory effects in the doses of 20 and 30 ml /Kg, orally. The drug also showed the analgesic activity for 50 and 30 ml / kg, which showed 53.36% and 37.31% effect respectively. A separate study focused on statistical optimization of Nilavembu Kudineer using Response surface methodology (RSM) and its antibacterial activity. The combined interactive effect suggested that RSM mediated optimization can help enhance antimicrobial activity.

Dr. Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann, Founder of Homoeopathy (Figure 1), was a great pharmaceutist, linguist and a reputed German physician. He was dissatisfied with the state of medical practice at that time and took to experimentation in Chemistry and translation of scientific literature. He contributed regularly to Crell's Annals of Chemistry (the first journal devoted to Chemistry in Germany) from 1787 to 17941. While translating Cullen's Materia Medica, from English to German in 1790, he came upon the idea of experimenting with Cinchona bark (a drug used for treatment of intermittent fevers in those times) on himself. He found that when taken in a healthy state, cinchona produced symptoms similar to those of intermittent fever. Over a span of six years, Dr. Hahnemann conducted many such experiments with known medicinal substances and deduced the principle of similia similibus curentur i. e., 'let likes be treated by likes'. He concluded in 1796 that the therapeutic activity of any substance in a sick individual is dependent on its capability of producing a similar diseased state in a healthy individual.1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI Dr. Hahnemann identified this new system of therapeutic application of drugs for treatment of patients as 'Homoeopathy' derived from the Greek words 'Homoios', meaning 'similar', and 'pathos', meaning 'suffering'. He also coined the term 'Allopathy' (Greek words 'Alios', meaning 'different', and 'pathos', meaning 'suffering') for the prevailing medical system. The word Allopathy first appeared in 1816 in the preface to the first edition of the second volume of Materia Medica pura, where Dr. Hahnemann described medicines \"which stimulate the healthy body as illness different (allopathic) from the one that is to be cured\"2. Dr. Hahnemann contributed in reforming the medical practices of the 18th century by attributing the cause of disease to the internal environment of the host and thus originated the basic tenet that every 'Bradford TL. Life and letters of Dr. Samuel Hahnemann. Delhi: B. Jain publishers; 2004 Jutte Robert. Samuel of Homeopathy. Translated by margot Saar.

Further, he undertook proving of drugs on healthy human beings, giving dynamised form of medicines in minimum dose and advocated restoration of health of sick individuals in a gentle manner. In the journey from large to smaller doses of drugs, the effects of a substance travel from universally lethal for all, to finer symptoms in a few sensitive individuals. Thus toxicity, side effects or drug resistance is not encountered during the course of treatment and the medicines are truly simple - both in form and application. The process of individualization builds up a doctor-patient relationship allaying natural fears and apprehensions of a sick individual. Since its introduction to the humanity, the basic principles of Homoeopathy have not changed, as it is primarily a specialized system of rational therapy based on fixed and definite laws of nature and in this lies its inherent strength. Even after 200 years, the philosophy as laid down by Dr. Hahnemann forms the guiding force of homoeopathic practice for physicians around the world. Homoeopathy is one of the most popular systems of medicine, sought after by suffering patients. It is playing a major role in the integrated the public healthcare delivery system of India due to its wide acceptance by people at large. This acceptance is mainly due to its simplicity, affordability, safety, holistic approach etc. Homoeopathy came into being in the 18th century with the determination and incessant efforts of Dr. Hahnemann, during the era of experimentation, when medicine had taken a trajectory from the established norms and was largely dependent on observations and inferences. A host of scientific developments took place and a shift in the practice of medicine transpired. Throughout his life, Dr. Hahnemann along with his disciples continued experimentation to make the science of Homoeopathy more perfect. He wrote six editions of his masterpiece, Organon of Medicine, from 1810 to 1842, where he gradually evolved the philosophy of Homoeopathy, largely by his own observations and experimentations. Dr. Hahnemann, alone, could prove therapeutic indications of 111 drugs during his lifetime that are used successfully in homoeopathic practice even today. The early 19th century saw the establishment of colonial powers with its consequent political, social, cultural and scientific transformations. These colonial powers brought in urbanization, modernization, industrialization, literacy, mass communication and political participation by the masses. The spread of the western school of medicine i. e. 'Allopathy' was aided by the political and economic powers of the colonial rulers and increasing nationalization of medicine gave rise to pharmaceutical companies . Where the other traditional systems remained secluded in their native countries of origin, Homoeopathy had spread rapidly to the other parts of the world in the early 19th century. Consequently, Homoeopathy flourished in the European nations (Austria, Hungary, Italy, Denmark, France, England, Spain, and Belgium). In Germany, Homoeopathic hospitals were established in Munich, Berlin and many other cities. Within Europe, Austria was the first country to be influenced by the growing popularity of Homoeopathy in Germany. By 1819, Homoeopathy had made sufficient advance in the Habsburg Empire (present-day Austria & Hungary) to the extent that its practice was forbidden by an Imperial Decree. In spite of this, Homoeopathy successfully asserted itself and in 1837, this decree was rescinded. Homoeopathy reached Italy from Austria and flourished there from 1820 to 1840.I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I AYUSH SYSTEMS 148 Homoeopathy in India Homoeopathy is currently used in over 80 countries. It has legal recognition as an individual system of medicine in 42 countries and is recognized as a part of complementary and alternative medicine in 28 countries3. Three out of four Europeans know about Homoeopathy and of these, 29 percent use it for their own health care4. Studies have identified Homoeopathy to be the most frequently used CAM therapy for children in European countries5 '6 ' 1 2 ,1 3 '1 2 ,1 3 '7 '8 . The National Health Interview Survey 2007 past 12 months), estimated 3.9 million adults and 910,000 children used Homoeopathy in North America 9 .According to a survey conducted in India, sixty two percent of current Homoeopathy users have never tried conventional medicines for day-to-day health problems and eighty two percent would not switch to conventional treatments, unless it is an emergency1 0 . Legislation regarding Homoeopathy and other complementary and traditional systems is different in different countries1 1 . It is officially recognized in Central and South American countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico), European countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom) and in Asia (India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh). It is integrated into mainstream healthcare in Brazil, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Mexico, Bangladesh and the United Kingdom. India has a population of over one billion and is an emerging economic global power. The country shows a wide variation in terms of per capita income, purchasing parity; impacting income, expenditure and social stratification. The collective orientation of the society reflects itself in the National Health Policy of India and also underlines the governmental patronage to modem as well as the Indian systems of Medicines and Homoeopathy. The Government of India facilitated the spread and development of Homoeopathy by recognizing and integrating it into healthcare delivery. The history of Homoeopathy in India can be traced to the early 19th century, to German missionaries treating people on the shores of Bengal.

He treated the legendary Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Punjab1 8 . The initial success of Homoeopathy in cholera and other epidemics in Bengal in the 19th century made it a known therapeutic system to the common man. Homoeopathic charitable dispensaries and hospitals were opened, and private practitioners, either disciple of experienced homoeopaths or from self-learning started practicing. It received a further impetus with the establishment of educational institutions and pharmacies. The system owes recognition to the concerted efforts of some eminent allopathic practitioners of the time, who opted for Homoeopathy and used it with remarkable success. The efforts of a few institutionally trained homoeopathic physicians paved the way for the then Bengal Provincial Government to establish the General Council and State Faculty of Homoeopathic Medicine in 1943. The system had spread around the world, within a relatively short period as it had similarities in its approach with the prevailing traditional and ethnic medical systems and merged with them. Thus, homoeopathic hospitals, colleges and pharmacies were opened in many parts of the world during the 19th century. Simultaneously, the science of Homoeopathy evolved in the form of new drugs, pharmaceutical procedures, generation of clinical evidence, development of literature in the form of Materia Medicas, Repertories, Pharmacopoeias, philosophical essays, etc. However, a combination of various factors, especially in the first half of 20th century, such as difference of opinion amongst homoeopaths, the disparity between principles and practice,, advances in allopathic pharmaceuticals, resulted in temporary sidelining of Homoeopathy in most parts of the world. In contrast, in India, Homoeopathy flourished throughout the 20th century, particularly in the latter part of the century. Today, India has a strategic advantage over other countries, in terms of infrastructure and intellectual and clinical resources in Homoeopathy. As per the Constitution of India, health care delivery is the primary responsibility of the government. Indian administrative set up being federal in nature, health care is allotted as a State subject. Post-independence in 1947, the legislatures of Indian States began enacting laws to regulate teaching, practice and research such as the Madras Registration of Practitioners of Integrated Medical Act of 1956 and the Mysore Homoeopathic Practitioners Act of 1961. State legislatures made them responsible for strengthening colleges, hospitals, dispensaries and pharmacies dealing with Indian systems of medicine and almost all the states established Directorates of Indian Medicine for the development of traditional systems. At the centre, indigenous systems of medicine became a part of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and growth and development of these systems was made legitimate by including these systems in the First and all the subsequent National Five Year Plans1 2 . The Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia Committee (HPC) was constituted in 1962 by the Government of India to lay down the standards for quality control and manufacturing of homoeopathic drugs.I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I 1 2 1988 Indian system of medicine and homoeopathy - National and state profiles.

A combined Council to conduct research in Indian Systems of Medicine and Homoeopathy was formed initially (1969), which paved the way for individual research councils and consequently, the Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH) was formed (1978). The Council has evolved over the years to develop and identify broad areas of research in Homoeopathy in the country. Scientists in India conduct clinical research, drug research and basic research and efforts are made to enhance the quality of research. The Homoeopathy Central Council Act, 1973 (HCC Act) enacted by the Indian Parliament established the legislative mechanism to regulate education and practice in Homoeopathy in the country. The National Institute of Homoeopathy (NIH) was established in 1975 in Calcutta (now Kolkata) as a model institute for under-graduate & post-graduate education and research. The Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia Laboratory (HPL) was also founded in 1975 to lay down principles and standards for preparation of homoeopathic drugs. A separate department was constituted in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to specifically look at the issues concerned with the Indian Systems of Medicine and Homoeopathy (ISM & H). The Department of ISM&H was established in 1995 and re-named as Department of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy). A National Policy on Indian Systems of Medicine and Homoeopathy was enunciated in 2002 with the objective of enhancing the outreach of healthcare through these systems. The policy also outlined strategies for growth of education, research, drug development, infrastructure facilities, and integration of ISM&H in the health care delivery system and national health programmes. In 2014, The Department of AYUSH was converted to a Ministry of AYUSH. Due to the sustained efforts of the government, an institutional framework of Homoeopathy has been established at the Centre as well as in all the states. The important milestones in the development of Homoeopathy in the country are summarized on the next page. AYUSH SYSTEMS 13.2 Brief on CCRH The Government of India established Central Council for Research in Indian Medicines and Homoeopathy (CCRIMH) in the year 1969 as an autonomous body under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to promote research and development in different Indian systems of medicine on scientific lines. However, with a view to have focussed research in each area of Indian systems of medicine and Homoeopathy, the CCRIMH was dissolved to pave way for the constitution of four separate research Councils, one each for Homoeopathy (CCRH), Ayurveda and Siddha Medicine (CCRAS), Unani Medicine (CCRUM) and Yoga & Naturopathy (CCRYN).The Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH), formally constituted on 30th March, 1978, was set up as an autonomous organization and registered under the Societies Registration Act XXI, 1860. CCRH is fully funded/controlled by the Ministry of AYUSH. The pattern of emolument structure, i.e. pay scales and allowances, Dearness Allowance, House Rent Allowance, Transport Allowances, etc. are identical to those in case of the Central Govt, employees. Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy (CCRH) is an apex research organization under Ministry of AYUSH, Govt, of India which undertakes, coordinates, develops, disseminates and promotes scientific research in Homoeopathy. The Headquarters of the Council are situated in New Delhi and multi-centric research is conducted through a network of 24 institutes/units all over India. These include 02 Central Research Institutes at NOIDA, Uttar Pradesh, and at Kottayam, Kerala, which have multi\u00ad specialty OPDs and IPD facilities and pathological & radiological laboratories. There are 08 Regional Research Institutes, one Homoeopathic Drug Research Institute, 11 Clinical Research Units and Extension Units, one Drug Standardization Unit, one Clinical Verification Unit, one Medicinal Plants Unit where specific research programs are conducted. AIMS Formulate the homoeopathic research projects/programs Initiate, develop, undertake and coordinate scientific research in fundamental and applied aspects of Homoeopathy Exchange information with other institutions, associations and societies interested in the objectives similar to those of the Council Initiate collaborations of research studies with other Institutes of Excellence. Propagate research findings through monographs, journals, workshops and develop audiovisual aids for dissemination of information to the profession and the public. The policies, directions and overall guidance for the activities of the Council are regulated by the Governing Body. Hon'ble Minister Incharge of AYUSH, Government of India is the president of the Governing Body and has general control on the affairs of the Council. The Council adopts the state of art tools and techniques of research management, viz. research prioritization, research programming and research management information system, making India a global leader in the field of homoeopathic research. The Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) headed by a senior scientist of repute, provides direction to the research activities. The SAC helps the Council in formulation, appraisal, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the research projects. The Ethical Committee of the Council formed as per the guidelines of issued by the national regulatory authorities, looks into the ethical issues involved in each of the individual research studies undertaken by the Council. A brief about the main research areas of the Council is given below: Survey, collection and cultivation of medicinal plants Centre of Medicinal Plants Research in Homoeopathy is located at, Ooty, Nilgiri District of Tamil Nadu,, to survey, collect and cultivate the medicinal plants used in Homoeopathy. The survey is done to identify the raw drug material for standardization and authentication of folklore claims. The Unit also maintains herbarium of various homoeopathic medicinal plants and supplies raw drug material to the Drug Standardization Units of the Council and also to the homoeopathic industry for commercial use. The students from the homoeopathic medical colleges visit the Unit to develop further understanding about the plants used for Homoeopathic Pharmacy. Drug Standardization To ensure quality, genuineness and authenticity of raw drugs and to evaluate safety as well as efficacy of homoeopathic drugs, the Council at its Drug Standardization Units, has been conducting pharmacognostical, physico-chemical and pharmacological studies of various homoeopathic drugs. This profiling process is of high economic importance since it establishes the identity of the raw drug material and helps in laying down the standards of drugs for ensuring the quality of the product. The drug standardization data analyzed by the units is provided to the Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia Committee for inclusion in the Homoeopathic Pharmacopoeia of India, a reference book used by the homoeopathic industry as well as the academicians.I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI AYUSH SYSTEMS Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll Drug Proving Drug Proving (Homoeopathic Pathogenetic Trial or HPT) forms the basis of homoeopathic treatment. The objective is to find out the homoeopathic symptomatology of indigenous and partially proven homoeopathic drugs on healthy human volunteers. The double blind placebo controlled methodology is now being adopted in the Drug Proving Programmes and modified protocols are used to get reliable results. The Council has roped in various homoeopathic medical colleges for the Drug Proving Programme by involving students and faculty to ensure transparency and accuracy in the work. The Council also provides guidelines to the homoeopathic colleges for their Drug Proving Programme, as drug proving has been made an essential part of BHMS degree and PG curriculum in Homoeopathy. Clinical Verification The clinical verification of homoeopathic drugs involves administration of the proven drugs on ill persons so as to reiterate the principle of similia and to verify the therapeutic action of the drugs on diseased individuals. The symptomatic data of homoeopathic medicines, including those proved by the Council and a few fragmentarily proven drugs observed to be clinically useful, is verified under this programme, thereby affirming the indications on which prescription can be based. Clinical Research Clinical research is one of the most integral activities of any medical research body. At the same time, it is the most dynamic in nature and subjected to several modifications in light of the latest study designs. The Council, in its pursuit to conduct research on the modem scientific parameters for validation of the outcome of studies, keeps abreast with the latest developments in the field of medical research and seeks guidance from various expert committees to ensure quality research. The highlights of the mandate behind new clinical research studies include: Formulating protocols in conformity with the guidelines of WHO/ICMR without conflicting the doctrines of Homoeopathy Ensuring ethical clearance for all protocols; Involving experts of modem medicine, bio-statistics and Homoeopathy for protocol making, diagnosis, follow-up, review and assessment of outcome of studies; Corroborating clinical evidence with laboratory tests required as per provisions of protocols Assessment of the studies by the internal/external reviewers and onsite visits For better and uniform assessment of clinical symptoms, the signs and symptoms of the patients included in clinical research are quantified as per the standard assessment scores for respective disease conditions. These scores are developed by the Council. Besides the symptomatic improvement, the quality of life (QOL) of a patient is also measured through standard QOL assessment tools developed by the Council. This scale was based upon the QOL tools laid down by various organizations of repute. Collaborative Research To seek the expertise of the scientists of various reputed institutes and avail of their resources, the Council has tied up with various national and international institutes of excellence with the state-of-the-art facilities. This liaison has not only ensured a quality work, but also provided more manpower and equipment, thus promising an unblemished output through evidence-based and inter-disciplinary research studies. The Council has collaborations with more than 30 institutes on various conditions. AYUSH SYSTEMS Extra-Mural Research The Extra-Mural Research (EMR) Scheme is a central sector scheme of Ministry of AYUSH launched to encourage the researchers from outside the department to conduct researches in the priority areas. These priority areas include clinical trials on childhood conditions, psychosomatic conditions, respiratory diseases, skin disorders, infections such as HIV/AIDS, influenza like illnesses, Chikungunya, etc. Basic research to elicit mechanism of action of Homoeopathic medicines, to identify the nature of ultra-high dilutions in potentized form and to explore and to establish pathway of action of homoeopathic medicines are also encouraged through interdisciplinary research. The Council has been coordinating the implementation of the scheme for the projects related to Homoeopathy since 2006. Documentation & Dissemination Documentation and its dissemination are two very important aspects in the field of science. It is believed that the real worth of a research lies in sharing its outcome with the stakeholders including clinicians, researchers, teachers, students, industry and the common man. Understanding the significance of an effective presentation in highlighting the core findings of scientific researches, the Council brings out quality publications in the form of books, monographs, handouts etc. Also, with the aim of widening the outreach of the research findings, the peer-reviewed research journal of the Council - Indian Journal of Research in Homoeopathy - was transformed into an online, open access journal. This has not only made way for a charge-free online access of the journal, but also enabled the whole peer reviewing process to be managed through the time- saving online Manuscript Management System. Further, a publication by the Ministry of AYUSH, 'Homoeopathy - Science of Gentle Healing' is a dossier that traces the evolution of Homeopathy in India and in world, the status and strategic position of Homeopathy in India and also provides a detailed account of the homoeopathic research work of the Council so far. International Collaborations Council is committed to enhance international cooperation for global promotion of evidence-based Homoeopathy through more international interactions, exchange of MoUs and organising international conferences. The Council liaises internationally to further its cause of scientific research and development of Homoeopathy. Plans ahead are to enter more collaborations with educational/ research institutes of countries having wide acceptability but lesser accessibility for Homoeopathy, and to establish academic chairs in countries needing technical assistance in capacity building. Epidemic management The preventive aspect of Homoeopathy is well known, and historically, Homoeopathy has reportedly been used for prevention during the epidemics of cholera, Spanish influenza, yellow fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria, typhoid etc. Council is, therefore, taking many initiatives in the field of epidemics. The various communicable diseases on which CCRH has conducted medical camps for conjunctivitis, dengue, recent past swine flu and chikungunya. Homoeopathic medicines were distributed for various disease conditions as mentioned above as per the genus epidemicus for preventive purpose. Similarly homoeopathic medicines were given for treatment purpose after a person got infected with the said disease tailored to the patient as per individualization.1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI 155 AYUSH SYSTEMS Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll CHAPTER -14 CORE ACHIEVEMENTS OF CCRH SINCE INCEPTION The Council is the premier and unique research organization in the world fully funded by the Government of India that undertakes studies on modem scientific parameters, using cutting edge technology. The Council conducts multi-centric research studies through its institutes and units and also in collaboration with reputed institutes of excellence. The research is undertaken with the goal that the outcome of the research translates into practice and the benefit of the research is extended to the profession and the public. The research outcomes are published in the form of books, monographs, manuscripts in national and international journals. Salient achievements in the areas of diseases of national importance, epidemic diseases, tribal health, basic research and drug development are as follows: CLINICAL RESEARCH Clinical Research has been the core research area of CCRH since inception. Till date one hundred and sixty one (161) clinical studies have been carried out. 20% of these studies belong to infectious diseases, followed by lifestyle and endocrinal disorders. A few significant conditions in which research has been undertaken are: HIV/AIDS, filariasis, influenza like illness, chikungunya, Acute Encephalitis Syndrome/ Japanese encephalitis, behavioural problems in children and adults, depression, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, autism, alcohol dependence, diabetes and its complications, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, polycystic ovarian syndrome, uterine fibroids, cervicitis and cervical erosion, Gastro esophageal reflux disease, gastroenteritis, osteoarthritis, cervical spondylosis, 2% RESARCH STUDY DESIGN The investigating team of each study tries to adopt research designs, as per the research question and objectives. Observational studies/ cohort studies are undertaken to generate hypothesis, which will further help to take up cause-effect relationship studies, i.e., Randomized controlled trials, the ' gold standard' in clinical research. Amongst them, 24 open label RCTs and 08 double blind controlled trials are undertaken, out of which 26 have been completed and 06 are on-going. The figure below elaborates this further.

Levels of publications and gradation In clinical research, there are different levels of evidence. World Health Organization in its publication - General Guidelines for Methodologies on Research and Evaluation of Traditional Medicine (2008) - has described different levels of evidence with following recommendations: Grade Recommendation A (Evidence levels quality Ia,Ib)Requires at least one randomized controlled trial as part of the body of literature of overall good and consistency addressing the specific recommendation. B (Evidence levels Ha, lib, III)Requires availability of well-conducted clinical studies but no randomized clinical trials on the topic of recommendation. C (Evidence level IV) Requires evidence from expert committee reports or opinions and/or clinical experience of respected authorities. Indicates absence of directly applicable studies of good quality. AYUSH SYSTEMS Illlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll Basing on these, the publications of the Council are graded. In t h e initial years, Council started publishing the results of its studies in the CCRH Quarterly Bulletin, Few studies were published in international journals also. Council is now encouraging its scientists to publish as many cases or i case seriesas possible to generate more evidence. The results of some of these studies have been disseminated in the national, international journals, as well as in the Council's Indian Journal of Research in Homoeopathy, which is now one of the reputed peer reviewed journals of Homoeopathy. A total of one hundred and sixty two (162) publications have been done. 100 80 < ua.T OQ .

Clinical research studies Series in 03 volumes have been published covering 28 disease conditions. Highlights of major research findings Infectious diseases HIV/AIDS A double blind study on HIV was undertaken in 1990s on patients with persistent generalised lymphadenopathy. Individualized homeopathic medicine was prescribed to patients in one group, while the other group was given placebo. Statistically significant difference was observed between verum and placebo groups (p=0.04) in CD4+ cell T lymphocyte counts in the 6 months treatment period. Phosphorus, Lycopodium, Pulsatilla and Nux vomica were some of the useful medicines in this strata. In another observational study with single arm design, 534 patients maintained asymptomatic status in for a period varying from 3-10 years, out of 572 patients at baseline. In symptomatic cases, intercurrent illnesses such as oral candidiasis, diarrhoea, weakness and weight loss responded favourably were some of the useful medicines found in this study. Further research on HIV patients also showed statistically significant changes in viral load, as compared to the baseline data (95% Cl, 0.16, 1.24, p=0.012), Body Mass Index (95% Cl,-1.12, - 0.57, p<0.001), physical health, psychological and environmental domains of WHO-Quality of Life - Bref (P< 0.05). Lymphatic Filariasis Council has undertaken several long term cohort studies in filariasis, prevalent in the coastal areas of India. The findings on 6268 patients showed complete absence of clinical events during the treatment and no recurrence during follow up period of 3-5 years. Grade I and Grade II lymphoedema disappeared or reduced after treatment. Single blind follow up study of 69 months has shown effectiveness with homoeopathic treatment reducing the frequency of filarial fevers Thuja were the most useful medicines. Acute encephalitis syndrome Another important infectious disease is acute encephalitis syndrome with 30% death rate in the prevalent areas. Adjuvant homoeopathy given in three studies, along with institutional management protocol (IMP), compared to IMP alone, enabled to reduce the death rate by 15-30 % with a statistical significant difference. Medicines found effective and useful were Belladonna, Stramonium, Hyoscyamus, diarrhoea in children A prospective, multi-centre observational study was conducted by CCRH during 2005 - 2008, with 14 pre-defined homoeopathic medicines. A total of 321 children were enrolled for the study.The difference in the mean number of stools and diarrhoea index score developed by the CCRH was found to statistically most useful medicines. Acute otitis media A randomized placebo-controlled parallel group trial to compare the effectiveness of Homoeopathy vs Conventional therapy in Acute Otitis Media (AOM) was conducted from May 2009 to April 2010, to evaluate the number of patients requiring antibiotic treatment in both groups. 81 patients were included, out of which 80 completed follow-up; 41 for conventional (analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretics) and 40 for homeopathic treatment (in LM potency). Outcomes were assessed by the Acute Otitis Media-Severity of Symptoms (AOM-1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI 161 AYUSH SYSTEMS SOS) Scale and Tympanic Membrane Examination over 21 days.39 (97.5%) patients had to be eventually prescribed antibiotics in the conventional group, whereas no antibiotics were required in the Homeopathy group. 85% of patients were prescribed six homeopathic medicines.The medicines prescribed is sitting on the time-bomb called diabetes mellitus and is unfortunately becoming the global leader in the epidemic of diabetes. A few studies on diabetes and its complications, hypertension and lipoproteinemia have shown positive results with homoeopathic medicines. In these conditions, allopathic medicines could be tapered. Ulcers due to diabetes could also be well managed with individualized homoeopathy along with calendula dressing. Diabetic neurovathv A prospective multi-centric clinical observational study was carried out from October 2005 to September 2009 by CCRH. Patients were evaluated by the Diabetic Distal Symmetric Polyneuropathy Symptom Score (DDSPSS) developed by the Council. The appropriate constitutional medicine was selected and prescribed in 30, 200 and 1 M potencyon an individualized basis. Patients were followed up regularly for 12 months.247 patients (123 males and 124 females) completed the follow up. A statistically significant improvement in DDSPSS total score (p = 0.0001) was found at 12 months from baseline. Lycopodium clavatum, Phosphorus and Sulphur were the medicines most frequently prescribed and found useful. Diabetic foot ulcer A prospective observational study was conducted to ascertain the usefulness of a group of 15 pre-defined homoeopathic medicines in treatment of patients suffering from diabetic foot ulcer. (October 2005 to September 2009). A total of 63 cases completed the follow-up and treatment was given for six months. Patients were assessed through Diabetic Foot Ulcer Assessment Scale, developed by the Council. In 57 cases (90.6%), there was complete ulcer healing. Reduction in mean Ulcer Assessment Score was found to be statistically significant (P=0.001) after the treatment. Silicea, Sulphur, Lycopodium, Arsenic album and Phosphorus were found to be most useful. Mental disorders Mental disorders bear great challenge in treatment due the societal stigma attached with these patients. Council has explored this area through research on behavioural disorders of children and adults, schizophrenia, depression, alcohol dependence and attention deficit hyperactive disorder.I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I AYUSH SYSTEMS 162 Behavioural problems The objectives of the study were to identify a group of useful homoeopathic medicines in the management of behavioural disorders (1984 - 2005). Out of 4179 registered patients, a total of 3424 patients had regular follow up for varying periods. The study population consisted of following clinical conditions (ICD 09) - Senile Dementia, Transient organic psychotic condition, Schizophrenia, Affective disorders, Paranoid disorders, Specific non-pyschotic mental disorders following organic brain damage, Neurotic disorders, Personality disorders (Hysterical/Obsessive), Addictive disorders (Alcoholism), Disturbances of emotions specific to childhood and adolescence, Acute reaction to stress, Depressive neurosis and Psychosomatic disorders. 1595 patients improved markedly, 766 moderately, 426 mildly, and 437 did not improve. Medicines indicated frequently and found useful were: Cervical spondylosis A prospective randomized exploratory clinical study was undertaken for pain management of cervical spondylosis with two types homoeopathic potencies, millisemal (LM) potencies (CM) potencies. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) for pain was significantly less in the LM group [Median (IQR): 112 (86 to 299); p= 0.007], Overall quality of life of the patients after homeopathic medication showed significant improvement in the WHO-BREF domains: Physical, Psychological, and Environmental only. Most frequently used homeopathic medicines in both An observational study on 1557 patients suffering from osteoarthritis improved pain, joint tenderness, limitation of movement and stiffness. Bryonia, Calcarea disorders Vitiligo is a long-term skin problem that produces white patches of depigmentation on certain sections of skin. 207 patients with vitiligo were treated with individualized homoeopathic medicines Arsenicum sulphuratum flavum, Arsenic album and Nitric acid were found to be useful. Syphilinum, when used as an intercurrent remedy, was more effective. After the above study in 1990s , another observational multicentric study was undertaken aimed at further evaluating the usefulness of homoeopathic therapy in the management of vitiligo. 432 patients of all age groups suffering from vitiligo were enrolled in the study and 169 patients completed 2 years of follow-up. Vitiligo Symptom Score (VSS) was used to assess the change.

Ten homoeopathic medicines were found useful in the study, of which Sulphur, Arsenicum album, Phosphorus and Lycopodium clavatum were the most commonly indicated and useful medicines. Standard Treatment Guidelines The foremost aim of medical research is to translate research into public benefit. More the scientific rigour, more tangible are the results and better these would be adopted for users and beneficiaries. Keeping in view the above research findings of Council, as well as experiences of other researchers and clinicians on specific topics, Council has developed Standard Treatment Guidelines (STGs) on 20 disease conditions on the basis of evidence generated from clinical studies undertaken and subsequently published by the Council. These are: Acute otitis media, Alcohol dependence, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Benign prostatic hyperplasia, Bronchial asthma, Cancer, Depression, Diabetes Diarrhoea, Hypertension, fibroids and Vitiligo. Conclusion Council is committed to strengthen evidence basis in Homoeopathy through rigorous and contemporary clinical research. Identifying priority areas and finding answers to key research questions is one of the vital goals of Council. The fortification of special clinical research committee with experiences conventional and homeopathic clinicians, and knowledgeable scientists and statisticians has brought more credibility to the ongoing clinical researches of Council. Basic and Fundamental Research The Council collaborates with various institutes of excellence to utilize the potential of the best of the brains, in order to yield the maximum results. The main objective of the collaborative studies is to conduct evidence-based, inter-disciplinary research studies and to validate the efficacy / concepts of Homoeopathy on scientific parameters. It has concluded 37 collaborative studies with national institutes and 3 other with international institutes in a span of 23 years from 1979 to 2002 with a total of 46 publications. These not only include CSIR institutes like Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, (CIMAP) Lucknow, CDRI, Lucknow, Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology, Bhubaneswar, ICMR institutes like National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) etc., Jawahar Lai Institute of Medical Education & Research (JIPMER) Puducherry, IIT Delhi, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi University, Panjab University etc. but also international universities like University of California, Los Angles (UCLA).

After undergoing the hurdles of Standing Advisory Committee and Standing Finance Committee the final approved study starts which is supervised by the Council from time to time. AYUSH SYSTEMS ^ Illlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll GLIMPSE OF THE STUDIES The studies which have a greater impact on the healthcare of the masses deserve a special mention. Cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths in the world and homeopathy offers a relatively safe, cost-effective, non-invasive and easy to administer mode of onco-therapeutics with minimal side effects and relapse rates. A preclinical study titled \" Sulphur alters NFicB-p300 cross-talk in favour of in non-small cell lung carcinoma\" elucidated the molecular mechanism underlying the apoptogenic effect of sulfur in otherwise drug-resistant NSCLC cells, providing avenues for further clinical studies1 3 . A yet another pre-clinical study published in a peer reviewed journal, Oncology Reports, titled \"Contribution of ROS-p53 feed-back loop in of explored the anti-tumorigenic role of Thuja on mammary epithelial carcinoma cells and showed that thuja can be a potential medicine for targeted therapy by inducing apoptosis of functional p53-expressing mammary epithelial carcinoma cells1 4 . Another study published in BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine 2013, showed the role of Calcarea carbonica in inducing apoptosis in cancer cells in p53-dependent manner via an immune-modulatory circuit1 5 . All these studies have provided new insights into the mechanism of action of these medicines in our age-old practice of homeopathy.Apart from the conditions like cancer a lot work has been done on frequently found conditions like Renal stones, Diabetes etc. to create evidence for their effectiveness. In a study titled, \"Homoeopathic preparation of Berberis vulgaris as an inhibitor of Calcium oxalate crystallization: An in vitro evidence done at Dr. ALMPGIBMS, University of Madras B. vulgaris has been found to be a potent drug against Calcium Oxalate crystallization which adds up to the experimental evidence to support the efficacy of the homeopathic preparation of the B. vulgaris in modulating the primary events of stone formation1 6 .

A yet another important Study worth mentioning titled, \"Preliminary study to evaluate analgesic and behavioural effects of Lycopodium clavatum in experimental animals\" 12X (CNS) depressant activity1 8 . Several pharmacological and toxicity studies were undertaken to establish the safety of these drugs, a step further towards clinical trials. Toxicity studies were conducted to assess the level to which substances are toxic for humans and animals. In a study to evaluate the safety profile of Homoeopathic homoeopathic mother tinctures are relatively safe when administered orally to rats1 9 . In a yet to publish study to screen for the pharmacological and safety studies of the homeopathic concluded that homoeopathic mother tinctures used in the study as well as Eupatorium perfoliatum and Crotalus horridus at different dilutions are relatively safe when administered orally to rats. A notable volume of research work in the field of virology has been conducted, especially on Japanese encephalitis. Many countries of Asia have an estimated 68,000 clinical cases every year and currently there is no cure for the disease. In such a scenario, homeopathy offers a hopeful clinical intervention and Belladonna 200 has shown some positive results in evading virulent Nakayama strain JEV infection in suckling mice fed with the medicine providing scope for further research20.1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI 1 7 Sampath S , Narasimhan A , Syzygium jambolanum and Cephalandra indica on gastrocnemius muscle of high fat and high fructose-induced type-2 diabetic Homeopathy 2013; H , Nayak C .

The positive results indicate that we are not far away in unveiling the mystery underlying Homeopathy and its application to the welfare of the society. Apart from these collaborations, Council has established India's first State of art virology laboratory at Dr. Anjali Chatterjee Regional Research Institute for Homoeopathy in Kolkata in the year 2017 for conducting basic and fundamental research in Homoeopathy for viral diseases like influenza, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, chikungunya and swine flu. Several studies, primarily on dengue, were undertaken such as studying the NS1 antigen expression by dengue virus infected vero cells under the influence of Crotalus (6C)2 2 , Rhus tox 6C in relation to dengue virus infection 2 3 , exploring the primary cell culture of Aedes albopictus midgut cells as a prospective model for in vitro study of arboviruses etc. and the major findings of the studies have been published. Further, well-equipped chemistry laboratory and pharmacology laboratory with zebra fish facility have been established at Dr. D.P. Rastogi Central Research Institute for Homeopathy, NOIDA for conducting experiments. Research is going on full swing at these institutes as evident from the studies undertaken and the publications. Also establishment of fundamental research laboratory in homoeopathy at Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST), Shibpur, Howrah for materialising long standing requirement for homoeopathic science is under progress and work of infrastructure development has started. Besides, the Council is optimistic in expanding its international collaborations with many more prestigious institutes in the future years. 2 1 Mathie R T, Baitson E S , Frye J, , Manchanda R K , Fisher P.

Though homoeopathy has been curing and serving the humanity since last 200 years but due to its hidden perspectives like mechanism of action, nature of medicines etc., it has been wrongly tagged as placebo effect and not given the recognition, which it really deserves. Although the practitioners are repeatedly giving the clinical evidences of its been working but it requires a sincere team effort with interdisciplinary scientists to unveil these hidden perspectives. Drug proving Apart from various research areas, the focus and mandate of CCRH for drug proving programme was on proving of fragmentarily proved drugs and indigenous drugs. Council is following a harmonised drug proving protocol in coherence with the guidelines also followed by the international organisations like LMHI, HPCUS, ECH etc. Initially the proving trials were done with mother tincture and potencies ranging from 3X to 1M. At present there are eight drug proving centers and provings are being conducted in association with the Homoeopathic Medical Colleges in the vicinity of these centres. The Council is also giving technical support in form of providing the Drug Proving protocol, Training manual and module for homoeopathic drug proving and also conducting orientation workshop at the homoeopathic medical colleges that aspire to carry out this research programme at their level. Since inception, the achievements of drug proving research section is as mentioned below: > Drugs Proved: 112 drugs and Proving data of 92 drugs has been published > Books published: 06 containing Drug Proving data of 82 drugs + 01 book in printing containing Drug Proving data of 10 drugs > Articles published in CCRH Quarterly Bulletin: 57 > Articles published in IJRH: 26 > Drug Monographs published: 21 > Training Manual and Module for Homoeopathic Drug Proving: 01 > Revised Drug Monographs for 03 drugs submitted for publication Till now, the CCRH has methodically proved 112 drugs, out of which 83 drugs are of plant origin, 09 are of animal origin and 18 are prepared from chemicals, 01 Sarcode and 01 is nosode. There are 15 drugs of Indian origin and 02 allopathic drugs, which are proved in homoeopathic dilutions for the first time by CCRH, which are mentioned below:1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI 169 AYUSH SYSTEMS ^ Illlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll S.No. Name of the drug Source of drug Year of proving 1.

Com, Vaio\u00ab * AihValgn Revision of Homoeopathic Pharmacopeia of India (HPI): Council has undertaken the revision work of HPI in the year 2014. The drugs for revision were identified from EDL as per the ABC-VED matrix on the basis of the frequency of the drug being prescribed by the homoeopathic doctors. The aim of this exercise is to revise the existing HPI monographs in the light of modem scientific knowledge and WHO guidelines on drugs safety and homoeopathic preparations, and to bring them to the standard of other foreign Pharmacopoeias. 104 drugs have so far been revised accordingly. Study for laying down the Finished Product Standards (FPS) A study for laying down the FPSforl50 homoeopathic drugs, encompassing their comprehensive evaluation with respect to their pharmacognostic, physico-chemical and pharmacological profiles is being carried out. Council's unit in Emerald, Ooty, Centre of Medicinal Plants Research in Homoeopathy (CMPRH), has conducted 214 survey tours throughout India for collection of the raw drug material of homoeopathic medicinal plants. It has also provided 469 authentic drug material to the Drug Standardisation Centers of the Council for the drug standardization studies. Besides collection, cultivation of homoeopathic medicinal plants, both exotic (61) and indigenous (14) origin, is being maintained by this unit in the form of germ plasm under the polyhouse made up of polycarbonate sheets.This unit has also studied the techniques for cultivation and enhanced yield for further development of the area of cultivation, increased market demand and higher economical values of exotic homoeopathic medicinal plants. Clinical Verification Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy has been conducting clinical verification studies of indigenous, rare and fragmentarily proved drugs since its inception in 1975. Some of these drugs have been first proved by CCRH. The program is multicentric, as per open clinical trial design in which patients are enrolled from O.P.D., as and when they come, and after confirmation of their inclusion criteria as per a laid out standard. The primary objective of the study is to clinically verify the symptomatology of the drug, as observed during proving or as mentioned in other literature. The secondary objective is to ascertain the clinical symptoms that did not appear during the proving but were improved in the patients after its administration, either completely or partially. The homoeopathic medicines are prescribed on the basis of symptom similarity. The individualistic symptoms of each case are evaluated as per the Materia Medica&Repertorial index, especially devised for the program from the proving data. Clinical Verification of symptomatic data of 106 drugs have been conducted so far. It includes the following:I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I AYUSH SYSTEMS 172 Ill I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI a. 72 remedies of plant origin which includes 39 indigenous are a few of the important plant remedies verified by the Council. b. 22 remedies of chemical origin which includes Acid category drugs from allopathic drugs have also been proved and verified, like Azothioprine and Cyclosporin. c. 09 remedies of animal origin which includes 07 spider remedies.

EPIDEMIC RESEARRCH Considering the epidemic outbreaks of vector borne diseases, such as Dengue, Chikungunya, Japanese encephalitis and Influenza, Council has taken various steps for generating evidence on the efficacy of Homoeopathy intervention and development of new drugs based on literature and validating the same for the prevention and management of these diseases. A brief appraisal of pre-clinical and clinical studies undertaken by Council is as under: DENGUE To validate the traditional knowledge of use of Eupatorium perfoliatum in prevention of Dengue Fever, 02 field studies were undertaken in 2016 and one field study is ongoing in New Delhi along with 03 preclinical studies with institute of repute. Council has conducted acluster randomized preventive study at Vembayam and Karakulam village of Trivandrum District of Kerala in April 2017. In this study, 64,096 healthy individuals were enrolled for participation. Study has been completed and data analysis is in process. Another cohort study completed by Council in June 2016was undertaken at JJ Colony, Mayapuri, New Delhi for prevention of dengue using Eupatorium perfoliatum. This was an observational study in which the preventive medicine was distributed to 19,880 healthy population and followed up for 3 months to assess the effectiveness of medicine in prevention of 173 AYUSH SYSTEMS dengue. In the successive year 2017, preventive study of Dengue and Chikungunya was approved by different committees of the Council and study was initiated on 1st July 2017. This was an open cluster level study. The study participants enrolled for the study belonged to the slum areas with high mosquito population, but apparently healthy. The enrolled individuals received Eupatorium perfoliatum 30 once in a week for 10 weeks. A total of 70,000 participants were enrolled and are now under follow up. To understand the best mode of propagation of public health advisory, Council has conducted a survey to assess the effect of AYUSH public health advisory during epidemic period and it was found that awareness among the public for use of AYUSH modalities for epidemics was low and we need to use another channel of communication like Television, Social media etc. During an outbreak of Dengue in Delhi in 2015, Council conducted an exploratory study at a short notice at Hedgewar Hospital, New Delhi, to assess the effectiveness of homoeopathic integrative care, along with allopathic institutional management, in 138 patients admitted with low platelet count, with or without fever. The study was quasi experimental, and the results were encouraging. Further, Council has developed dengue nosode from 4 prevalent serotypes of the dengue viruses, in association with National Institute of Virology, (NIV) Pune to prevent and combat dengue illness. Further, a study for testing the safety and toxicity of this nosode was conducted in collaboration with All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi. Following this, the nosode will be studied for its immuno\u00ad modulatory effect, especially against dengue infection and a field trial will be undertaken to explore its efficacy. The safety and toxicity studies of commonly used Homoeopathic Medicine Eupatorium perfoliatum and Crotalus horridus for the prevention of Dengue have been conducted at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi and these drugs have been found to be safe. CHIKUNGUNYA During the outbreak of chikungunya in 2007, Council conducted a cluster-randomised, double\u00ad blind, placebo-controlled trial in Kerala for prevention of Chikungunya. Bryonia alba 30C/placebo were randomly administered to 167 clusters. The participants were observed for a period of 35 days to note the incidence of chikungunya among the participants. Infection rate in the study groups was analysed and compared by use of cluster analysis. The results of study showed significant difference between the two groups. Bryonia alba 30C had a significant protective effect in chikungunya in comparison to placebo .24I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I 2 alba' as a prophylactic during an in India: A cluster -randomised, double -blind, Res Homoeopathy 2014; 8:160-5.

Bryonia alba 30C had a significant protective effect in chikungunya in comparison to placebo. Council has completed data collection in the month of September 2016 for chikungunya cases in collaboration with Govt, of NCT, Delhi. This project involved 10 Delhi Homoeopathic Dispensaries and 02 Homoeopathic Medical Colleges of Government of NCT, Delhi along with Council's centres in Delhi NCR region. From this project, practical therapeutics was evolved with the help of data collected, which will help in formulating treatment guidelines for practitioners. MALARIA Council has undertaken preclinical study with the Department of Zoology, Panjab University, Chandigarh to evaluate the effect of homoeopathic medicines on in vitro and in vivo models. As a part of the study, Council is developing new medicine (malaria nosode) for prevention and treatment of malaria. The nosode will further subject to safety and effectiveness on cell lines and animal model. Further, in collaboration with Indian Institute of Public Health Bhubaneswar, Council has undertaken study to assess the effectiveness of identified homoeopathy medicine in prevention of malaria. Approximately 18,000 healthy population was enrolled in the study. The study is ongoing. 2 alba' as a prophylactic during an in India: A cluster -randomised, double -blind, placebo- SYSTEMS Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS (JE)/ ACUTE ENCEPHALITIS SYNDROME (AES) Training o f health workers for JE study Council had completed one preclinical study (2007-10) to assess the effectiveness of Belladonna as preventive for in vitro and in vivo model in collaboration with School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata. It was found that Belladonna significantly protected the mice from JE infection.' Further, Council has undertaken another preclinical study in collaboration with Center for Cellular and molecular Biology, Hyderabad to understand the action of Belladonna-Calcarea carb. - Tuberculinum as combined regimen on JE for prevention and treatment of JE during its epidemic in eastern parts of U.P. in 1989, 1991 and 1993. Belladonna 200, single dose was distributed as a preventive to 3,22,812 persons in 96 villages in three districts of U.P. In the follow up of 39,250 persons, none of them reported any signs and symptoms of Japanese encephalitis. This was a preliminary study. Further, to validate the results of previous field studies and preclinical studies, a studyfor prevention of JE/AES using homoeopathic medicine Belladonna was initiated in July 2017in Chargawan block of Gorakhpur. A total of 50,000 children have been enrolled and are being followed up. Study shall be completed in June 2018.To substantiate the role of homoeopathic medicine Belladonna, which could inhibit JE virus infection in both the models significantly, another exploratory observational study was undertaken by the Council in IPD 2 6Bhaswati et al.

The results of this study also validated the earlier findings that add-on homoeopathic treatment can reduce mortality and morbidity significantly, compared to the standard treatment alone. INFLUENZA-LIKE ILLNESSES (ILI) Homoeopathy became famous by means of successfully treating the horrible epidemic of the Spanish flu in the nineteenth century. Because we are now threatened by the rise of epidemic of influenza and waning effectiveness of antibiotics, other options are urgently needed. Homoeopathy can often provide an effective alternative.1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI Health worker giving medicine in area A prospective, multi-centre, data collection survey of homoeopathic practice in the treatment of influenza-like illness was done in India during the 2009 pandemic of A/H1N1 influenza ('Swine Flu', SF). The authors surveyed the practice of homoeopathic practitioners in India in the management of SF. A total of 44 different remedies (or combinations of remedies) were used at first appointments, the most frequently prescribed drug being Arsenicum album (n = 265; 23.5%). The prominent symptoms of this pandemic in India were: temperature >38\u00b0C + cough + runny nose, which likened the indications of Arsenicum album. Council was a part of this significant study. Further, Council conducted a multicenter, single blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of homoeopathic medicines in the treatment of Influenza like illness and to compare the efficacy of LM (50 millesimal) potency vis-a-vis centesimal (C) potency. There was a significant difference in temperature from 2n d day onwards in LM and Centesim al groups. The study revealed the significant effect o f individualized homoeopathic treatment in the patients suffering from ILI with no marked difference between LM and Centesimal groups. The complication/sequel rate was also significantly less in the intervention groups. The medicines which were commonly prescribed were: Arsenic album, 2 9 Manchanda RK, Oberai P, Roja V, Singh S, Singh N, Khan T, Prasad R, Singh J R.

To generate the scientific evidence for using Homoeopathy in prevention of Influenza Like Illnesses, Council is conducting a preventive cohort study in New Delhi. The study participants have been enrolled from the communities of Mayapuri, Peeragadi and Zakhira. The enrolled individuals receive Influenzinum 30 for 10 weeks and are kept under observation till the epidemic period is over. Sample size of 40,000 healthy individuals have been reached in this study. Another study, a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is conducted by Council in collaboration with Homoeopathy University of Jaipur. The study participants will be screened from a homoeopathic medical college in New Delhi. For seroprevalence study, all the enrolled participants will give their blood sample for testing immune parameters before consuming medicine, and then again after 5 weeks of intervention and on completion of study. If participantshappen to suffer from fever during the study period, he/she are instructed tocontact the study doctor for arrangement of laboratory test for diagnosis of influenza. After fulfillment of inclusion criteria and written informed consent, the participants are enrolled and randomised to receive the assigned group of intervention. National Campaign on Homoeopathy for Mother and Child Care Keeping in view the strength of Homoeopathy in the disease conditions of pregnancy, puerperium and lactation and in childhood disorders, the Department of AYUSH launched a National Campaign on Homoeopathy for Mother and Child Care in 2007. The Council operationalized and coordinated the campaign, which was conducted till 2012. A national workshop on Homoeopathy for Healthy Mother and Happy Child was organized to sensitize all stake holders i.e. policy makers, program evaluators, opinion makers, homoeopathic and allopathic practitioners, NGOs, etc. Thirty four state level workshops were organized in all the states followed by 93 district level orientation workshops. More than 1600 community awareness camps and clinics were organized by the Council through its institutes, units and through homoeopathic medical colleges, where in more than 4 lakh patients were benefited.The campaign also focused on capacity building and training of homoeopathic physicians in dealing with women and children disease conditions. The Council prepared three training manuals (obstetrics, pediatrics and general management) with WHO country office in India (Figure 17). Fourty three state level training of trainers and 55 district level training programmes were organized for training homoeopathic practitioners on these modules.I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I 3 1 Chakraborty PS, Lamba CD, Nayak D, John MD, Sarkar DB, Poddar A, et al.

HOMOEOPATHY FOR HEALTHY CHILD Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy under directions from Ministry of AYUSH developed a pilot program on \"Homoeopathy for Healthy Child \"with a targeted approach to promote healthy dentition in children, treating the associated ailments like diarrhoea, fever/URTI etc. with other identified conditions and to sensitize audience about the benefits of homoeopathic medicines. The program enhances the availability and accessibility of homoeopathic treatment to the identified population group. 186 AYUSH SYSTEMS BACKGROUND In a meeting held in July 2014, Hon'ble Prime Minister of India, inter-alia suggested that Homeopathy needs to be given adequate attention. In particular, specific medical conditions like teething in children, need to be identified where homoeopathic medicines can give relief without any side effects. The target audience has to be adequately sensitized about the benefits of homoeopathy medicines. Considering this, Ministry of AYUSH decided to undertake a program on 'Homoeopathy for Healthy Child' as additionality to the existing health care programs for the children being undertaken by Health & Family Welfare Departments. CCRH developed and implemented this public health program on pilot basis on research mode to develop a model which can be replicated all over the country. OBJECTIVES Reduce morbidity and promote faster recovery due to conditions such as diarrhea, respiratory infections, dental conditions, skin conditions, developmental delays, etc. in children Promote health through homoeopathy for identified conditions Sensitize target audience including health workers, patients and care givers about benefits of homoeopathy for common diseases.1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI AREA COVERAGE: The program is being implemented through 8 centres of CCRH in 12 pre-identified blocks.

AYUSH RESEARCH PORTAL A web portal (Figure 20) to showcase important research publications of AYUSH systems has been developed. It aims at providing information about these systems for wider acceptance as well as to encourage inter-disciplinary research. The information provided is categorized into individual AYUSH medical systems against a standard set of medical conditions, based on WHO disease classification ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases -10), and navigation is according to ICPC's (International Classification of Primary Care) 17 categories. It permits search of research articles with title, authors, scholars, guide, co-guide, designation, department, institution, address, journal, university, abstract, keywords, body system and disease. Literary Research The Council, under the literary research activity, brings out quality publications in the form of books, monographs, handouts etc. Prior to the era when computers and software repertories became widespread, Council updated different chapters of Kent's repertory from the Boericke's repertory to form a comprehensive document. Chapters on 'Mouth', & Chest', etc. were completed in this period. Updatinghomoeopathic literature on the basis of present day findings, however, is an ongoing literary research activity of the Council. Linking research with education To inculcate research aptitude in students, Council is working in coordination with the academicians and has initiated a scheme of financial grant to students to conduct research as a part of their PG program. Some publications of the Council cater to the academicians and students and have been prepared keeping in view the syllabus prescribed at undergraduate and post graduate levels. Under this initiative,Council launched the Short Term Studentship in Homoeopathy Scheme (STSH) for undergraduate students (http://ccrhscholarship.in/STSH2016/)1 INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI INI I INI I INI I III I INI I INI I INI I III I INI AYUSH SYSTEMS Illllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll in June 2014 and CCRH Scholarship Scheme for M.D./ Ph.D.students (http://ccrhindia.org/pdf/MDSCHEME.PDF) as a step towards capacity building and encouraging research aptitude among undergraduate, post graduate and Ph.D. students. The schemes were initiated for providing scholarship to selected medical undergraduates/graduates and postgraduates pursuing MD/PhD programmes in Homoeopathy through recognized medical institutes/ Universities, with the aim toorient them towards research methodology and techniques.This scheme allows them to either be associated for a short duration with their seniors on ongoing research program, or undertake independent projects. This is also expected to serve as an incentive to take up research as a career in the future and, at the same time, promote good quality research in homoeopathic medical colleges.Council also acts as the medium for the students to take their research work to a larger research audience. The program thus has multifaceted advantages ranging from mastering basic laboratory skills to understanding the basics of research methodology. SHORT TERM STUDENTSHIP SCHEME STSH is a fully online program managed through the website: https://ccrhscholarship.in/. Council aims to encourage more students to register in this program and is trying to maximize its efforts to popularize this program in the best interest of the students. To motivate the students, Hon'ble Minister Shri Shripad Naik, Minister of State (Independent charge), Ministry of AYUSH himself awarded certificates to the 12 awardees of STSH 2015 during World Homoeopathy Day 2017. As a step further, students will be presenting their work through poster presentations during this ongoing'Scientific Convention on World HomoeopathyDay' 2018.Although the abstracts published may appear naive as they are just the verbatim of students, the efforts of the students are worthy of appreciation. The scheme endeavors to link education with research and to discover the hidden researcher among these young students so that they can further strengthen research in homoeopathy. FUTURE VISION: DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE IN HOMOEOPATHIC COLLEGES In a step forward, the Council now proposes to support development of research infrastructure in all interested PG homoeopathic colleges by signing Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with CCRH.The vision behind the agreement would be to provide impetus to research infrastructure and to inculcate research aptitude amongst students and faculties.
