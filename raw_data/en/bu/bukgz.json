There will be further sessions to discuss and plan specific areas of vaccine administration. U.S. CDC has asked states to submit their preliminary draft vaccine plans this upcoming Friday, October 16, 2020. U.S. CDC has stressed that these initial plans will be revised frequently as we receive additional feedback from you.

As more vaccine becomes available, the goal is for everyone to be able to easily obtain a COVID -19 vaccine. The U.S. CDC ACIP will review clinical data and make recommendations regarding efficacy in different populations. Maine CDC is reviewing the NASEM report and would like feedback on the applicability of its approach in Maine. 9NASEM, Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID -19 Vaccine , 10/2/202010 Agenda COVID -19 vaccine planning and implementation Vaccine prioritization Communications Areas for initial feedback 11Communication, community engagement, and cultural competency will be critical to robust vaccine uptake Epidemics do not increase vaccine acceptance in racial or ethnic minorities, meaning targeted communication from trusted messengers remains necessary . When a vaccine is new, data on safety or risks are limited, and negative informal messaging occursTargeted CommunicationOurefforts willprioritize targeted messaging, community engagement and support, andculturally competent interventions topromote equitable acceptance and uptake ofadult immunizations . Sustained community engagement is key in identifying the education and support required to implement health efforts\u2014especially in communities that face instability with basic needs, such as employment, food, shelter, and clean waterCommunity Engagement Health care staff and first responders should provide culturally competent messaging and care \u2014and include minority groups in planning \u2014to encourage equitable engagement and outcomes in a pandemic responseCultural Competency 12Protect communitiesStrategy: Protect communities at risk from under -vaccination Leverage immunization data to find and respond to communities at risk Work with trusted local partners to reach at -risk communities before outbreaks Ensure vaccines are available, affordable, and easy -to-get in every community Empower familiesStrategy: Get providers and parents effective information resources Expand resources for health care professionals to help them have effective vaccine conversations with parents Work with partners to start conversations before the first vaccine appointment Help providers foster a culture of immunization in their practices Stop mythsStrategy: Stop misinformation from eroding public trust invaccines Work with local partners and trusted messengers to improve confidence in vaccines among key , at-riskgroups Establish partnerships to contain the spread of misinformation Educate key new stakeholders (e.g., state policy makers) about vaccines 13Agenda COVID -19 vaccine planning and implementation Vaccine prioritization Communications Areas for initial feedback Racial/ethnic disparities Prioritization Data reporting/analysis Others 14Leave comments in the chat or ic Other* Source: Vaccination Coverage among Adults in the United States, National Health Interview Survey, CDC, 2017.
