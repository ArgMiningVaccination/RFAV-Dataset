Homeopathy is a distinct medical art and science which employs tiny doses of natural medicines to stimulate the body's inborn healing capacity. The physician strives to perceive each patient's individual physical, mental and emotional nature, trying always to prescribe for the person, rather than the diagnosis. Homeopathy's central philosophical point is called the law of similars, \"Like Cures Like.\" People have observed that a substance which causes an illness or a symptom can, in very small doses, cure the same problem by stimulating the organism to realign itself. Homeopathic medicines are quite safe: they are known to be non-allergenic, non-toxic, and free of side effects. They are prepared from herbal, mineral, and animal substances by homeopathic pharmacies, under strict guidelines established by the FDA . Those practicing homeopathy include naturopathic physicians, medical doctors, chiropractors, osteopathic physicians, as well as trained professional homeopaths. The in-depth interview process delves deeply into the patient's physical, mental, and emotional nature. People often report that they enjoy the process and the individualized care provided by their homeopathic practitioner. The remedy is chosen by the practitioner after an interview and analysis. Classical homeopathy, such as that practiced in this office was originally conceived by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), encourages the prescriber to offer only one remedy at a time. Homeopathy is an advanced natural healing science whose tremendous value has been proven for over two hundred years and on every continent. Homeopathy can be effective in chronic (long-term) conditions, as well as acute (short-term) illnesses of adults, children and animals. Homeopathic medicines are non-toxic and have no side effects. They act curatively and preventively by raising your general level of health. In homeopathy, micro-dilutions of plant, mineral and animal substances are chosen based on a healing principle called The Law of Similars. This law states that any substance that can produce symptoms on a healthy person can cure those same symptoms in someone who is sick. Homeopathy is a truly holistic approach to health; one that emphasizes people rather than diseases. Homeopathy recognizes that each person responds uniquely to the forces of their heredity and environment. Mental, emotional and physical alterations from health (symptoms) are the indications of the body's effort to defend and heal itself. Contact Us Brian Henninger, N.D. 1305 Post Rd Suite 301 "}
