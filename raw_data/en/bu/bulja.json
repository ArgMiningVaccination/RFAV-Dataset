As CBS2's Maurice Dubois reported, they claim to heal everything from pain to low energy. For Karen Steele, shoulder, neck, and back pain is common. When on the go, she brings a treatment device with her. \"It's very convenient and easy to pack. It helps to maintain my good health when I'm away, as well as to relax me when I'm traveling,\" Steele said. When placed under her head, the device targets pressure points that relieve tension in tissues that cause her pain. She said the end result is similar to cranio-sacral therapy, where therapists use a light touch on the head, neck, and body to relieve pain and improve overall health. \"Most people do experience deep relaxation as well as reduction of pain and increase in energy,\" chiropractor Lynn Mabry said. The at-home devices claim to give similar results. Users claim they can relieve everything from migraines to muscle spasms and can even boost the immune system. Some pain specialists agree they can work. \"What I think it does is treat the muscles, treat sore or tight muscles at the back of the head, and provide some trigger point relief,\" pain specialist, Dr. Ronald Glick said. Glick said you can even make your own device by putting two tennis balls in a sock. \"You just tie off the end with a rubber band and they can use that to provide the same kind of pressure,\" Glick said. Steele, who works with a trained cranio-sacral therapist, said the device plays an important role in her treatment. \"I use the still point to continue to the good work of a therapist and the body's natural healing process,\" she said. There are some situations in which home devices should not be used, including any conditions where pressure on the head would cause instability. If you have questions about whether the treatment is right for you, you should ask your doctor. You May Also Be Interested In These Stories for more features. "}
