Campbell and colleagues in a report of a patient with corneal ulcers, erythematous papular lesions on the palms and soles, and severe impairment of mental development. Dendritic keratitis, causing lacrimation, photophobia, inflammation, ulcers, and scars; keratoses hypertyrosinemia; defective activity of hepatic cytoplasmic tyrosine aminotransferase. The most important manifestations of oculocutaneous tyrosinemia are those involving the eye, because they can lead to scarring of the cornea and permanent visual impairment. Transmission of oculocutaneous tyrosinemia is autosomal recessive. An animal model for oculocutaneous tyrosinemia is available in mink, where it produces a disorder known as \"pseudodistemper\" in which there are exudative lesions of the eyes and volar skin. The treatment of oculocutaneous tyrosinemia consists of the institution of a diet low in tyrosine and phenylalanine. Experience with maternal tyrosinemia indicates that dietary control during pregnancy would be prudent. Bell's Palsy [Charles Theisler](https://taylorandfrancis.com/search-results/?query=Charles%2BTheisler&tab=books) in [Adjuvant Medical Care](https://www.routledge.com/isbn/10.1201/b22898), 2022 Bell's palsy is a lower motor neuron disease of the facial nerve characterized by a transient paralysis. The disorder affects men and women equally and can occur at any age. Bell's palsy is associated with significant edema (swelling) and ischemia (restricted blood supply) of the facial nerve as it passes through its bony canal. 1 The primary cause is often exposure to a viral infection. The main symptom is muscle weakness on one side of the face, causing that side of the face to droop and appear distorted. Additional symptoms which may include pain behind the ear, loss of taste in half the tongue, sensitivity to sound in one ear, or excessive lacrimation in one eye, can be mild to severe. One disease protects from another disease [Dinesh Kumar Jain](https://taylorandfrancis.com/search-results/?query=Dinesh%2BKumar%2BJain&tab=books) in [Homeopathy](https://www.routledge.com/isbn/10.1201/9781003228622), 2022 Kent said that persons suffering from diabetes, tuberculosis, and Bright's disease can suffer from other dissimilar mild infections like dysentery. Emphysematous cholecystitis is a variant of gallbladder disease that tends to affect diabetic men. Infestations of the skin with candida and dermatophytes are common and bacterial infections of a variety of types also occur in diabetic patients. Kent said that persons suffering from diabetes, tuberculosis, and Bright's disease cannot suffer from other dissimilar mild infections like dysentery. Malignant external otitis and rhinocerebral mucormycosis, which are characterized by periorbital and perinasal swelling, pain, blood nasal discharge, and increased lacrimation, also exist with diabetes. Diabetes is characterized by thirst, polydipsia, polyuria, nocturia, tiredness, loss of weight, white marks on clothing, impotence, pruritus vulvae, and paresthesia or pain in limbs. \"An infection becomes apparent only after a certain incubation period which is defined as the time interval between invasion by infectious agent and appearance of the first sign or symptoms of the disease\". Comparative analysis of the outcome of external and endoscopic frontal sinus surgery in children Published in [Acta Oto-Laryngologica](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/IOTO), 2020 [Svetlana Alekseenko](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/doSearch?field1=Contrib&text1=Svetlana%2BAlekseenko), [Sergey Karpischenko](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/doSearch?field1=Contrib&text1=Sergey%2BKarpischenko) Background: Both open and functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) are performed in the case of pediatric frontal rhinosinusitis. However, data from comparative analysis of these surgery types are insufficient. Objective: Prospective randomized trial for comparison of open and endoscopic surgery outcome in pediatric chronic rhinosinusitis. Material and methods: The cohort included 30 pediatric patients (7-17 years) with open frontal sinus surgery and 34 patients who underwent FESS using DrafIIa. LundKennedy and Lund-Mackay scores, as well as Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20 (SNOT-20)questionnaire was used for pre- and postoperative assessment. Results: Open surgery and FESS resulted in a significant improvement in total LundKennedy, Lund-Mackay, and SNOT-20 scores, being more profound in FESS group. Using FESS significantly reduced surgery duration by 15% as compared to open surgery. In addition, open surgery was associated with a higher rate of scar formation, reduced local sensitivity, as well as local soreness, lacrimation, and psychological discomfort. In regression models FESS was negatively associated with postoperative total LundKennedy, Lund-Mackay, and SNOT-20 scores. Conclusion and significance: Generally, FESS resulted in better surgery outcome as compared to open surgery, although both approaches resulted in a significant improvement in chronic rhinosinusitis. Orbital Apex Syndrome Secondary to lacrimation, foreign body sensation, and eyelid oedema presented to our outpatient clinic. External examination identified erythematous rash with vesicles on the left eyelid, dorsum of the nose, and forehead of the patient. She was diagnosed to have herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO), and was started on oral brivudine and topical acyclovir. On the third day of the treatment, visual acuity of left eye was reduced; left blepharoptosis and total ophthalmoplegia had developed. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed enlargement of the extraocular muscles, and perineural enhancement of the optic nerve on that side. Oral brivudine was replaced with intravenous acyclovir, and oral corticosteroid was initiated. Complete resolution of proptosis and restriction of eye movements were achieved, and significant improvement of visual acuity was observed within a week. Orbital apex syndrome, a severe and rare complication of herpes zoster infection, can develop despite antiviral treatment. Rapid institution of appropriate therapy may provide complete recovery. Some Ocular Symptoms Experienced by Users of Mobile Phones Published in [Electromagnetic Biology and Medicine](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/IEBM), 2008 This survey study was conducted, using a questionnaire, on 229 university students (181 women, 48 men) in Kocaeli, Turkey. Six ocular symptoms experienced during use of mobile phones were studied by means of the chi-square test with Yates correction. The studied symptoms were blurring of vision, redness of the eyes, vision disturbance, secretion of the eyes, inflammation in the eyes, and lachrymation of the eyes. A significant increase in blurring of vision (p < 0.05) was reported by users of mobile phone possession >2 years compared to users of mobile phone possession <2 years. In users of mobile phones, women significantly (p < 0.05) complained more often of inflammation in the eyes than men.
