All students who presented papers and posters at the 40th Annual WKU Student Research Conference, as well as college deans and department heads, are invited to attend. The Sigma Xi Lecture will begin at 5:15 pm. The dinner buffet will follow the presentation at about 6:00 pm. Conference award winners will be recognized following dinner. Students received an email message with information about how to RSVP for the WKU Student Research Conference Banquet and Awards Ceremony. RSVPs were due by February 24. The Sigma Xi Lecturer is Dr. Emily A. Tobey, Professor and Nelle C. Johnston Chair in Early Childhood Communication Disorders at the University of Texas at Dallas. Dr. Tobey will discuss \"Frankenstein: How Physics, Literature and Theatre Led to a Scientific Success.\" The abstract for Dr. Tobey's presentation is as follows. It is hard to imagine how a simple observation made by Volta in the late 1700's could leave a lasting legacy impacting physics, literature and t h e a t r e . Y e t s u c h a n observation was made and a legacy was formed that impacts the arts and sciences in ways Volta could not conceive. It is even safer to assume that Volta had no idea that his basic reflection would lead to the restoration of multiple aspects of hearing for many deaf people around the world nearly 300 years later. Imagine a world of silence, imagine a world warning against the over reaching of man and the industrial revolution, and finally, imagine that for the first time you are hearing your child speak, listening to a horse chomp oats or hearing the fall leaves rustle in the wind. Imagine, if you will, a world no longer silent. Funding for the 40th Annual WKU Student Research Conference was provided by the Office of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs and by the WKU Chapter of Sigma Xi. The conference is organized by the WKU Student Research Council.

In my essay, I analyze and critique the Transcendentalists' ideology most associated with Thoreau as it is depicted in the context of man and intellect. I claim that Thoreau's intended coaxing of man to lead a more intellectually fulfilling life is transposed into a personal diatribe attacking what he sees as a pervasively illiterate man. I claim that while Thoreau's intentions may have been worthy, his belief in the inherent intellectual hierarchy of mankind coupled with the impracticality of his demands proves harshly cynical in the end. [page 5] Andrew, Kevin Andrew*^ \"Identification of DNA Biomarkers for Determining Sources of Fecal Pollution in the Environment\" (Rick Fowler, M.S. and Dr. Claire Rinehart) Most of Kentucky and a quarter of the world's population gets its water from underground aquifers formed in the underlying limestone. Kentucky and the Mammoth Cave region are recognized as part of the most extensive and vulnerable karst terrain on the globe. We compiled extensive DNA sequence data of the fecal-specific bacterial group Bacteriodes from online DNA sequence databases. These were obtained from many host species. Sequences of these genes were imported into the DNA analysis program Geneious to align sequences from different strains and look for DNA sequence features to determine how the strains from different animal and human hosts may be distinguished. Multiple simple-to-obtain parameters were compared and imported into Mathematica for multi-dimensional analysis. The results predict that different hosts can be discriminated. [page 9] Antle, Americans' Explanations for Lung Cancer Disparities\" (Dr. Della Brown White) As part of a larger study of African American families affected by lung cancer, groups of relatives were surveyed: smokers vs. never smokers, and blood vs. non-blood relatives. These participants were asked what they believed to be reasons for racial disparities in lung cancer in their own words. In order to use this open-ended data in analysis, a set of codes that reflect patterns of responses was developed. In order to ensure the validity and reliability of codes, coders used standardized definitions to assign numbers to each response. They practiced until agreement in coding decisions among multiple coders was achieved. The final product is a code-book that lists and defines all possible codes. [page 9] Ayre, Andrew and Grace, Joshua \"Power Management System for Smart Grid Monitoring\" (Drs. Stacy Wilson and Mark Cambron) The Power Management System for Smart Grid Monitoring is a device that is used for measuring various power line parameters. This particular device is attached to the power line and consists of individual sensors equipped with circuitry for various applications. The monitoring system will accurately measure voltage, current, and temperature of residential distribution and overhead power lines, and send this data along with GPS location wirelessly to a monitoring station. The final device will operate within the distribution level voltage ranges and currents of 69 kV and 0 to 300 amps, respectively. The data from each sensor will be interpreted by a microprocessor. This device will allow power companies to monitor whether certain areas of their power grid meet the required power needs of that system. [page 7] Baker, Lauren Emily \"Unresolved Questions in Science\" (Matt Tullis, M.F.A.) The objective of my student research project is to create a series of three posters that center on the overall theme of science. The resulting art pieces will convey my research on three separate branches of science: astronomy, biology, and chemistry. I will use digital collage to achieve this objective. I will research each of the three branches of science that I have chosen and will pinpoint the advances in each field that I believe best defines that branch of science and I will translate that information into images. The resulting three posters will be similar enough to be easily identified as belonging to the same series but each will uniquely represent its respective subject. [page 11] Bartek, Jordan See \"The Hormesis Real One?\" (Dr. Rajalingam Dakshinamurthy) Hormesis is a binary response phenomenon with low-dose stimulation (or inhibition) of effects by substances producing opposite responses at a high does. Escherichia coli cells are one of the most widely used hosts for the production of heterologous proteins and its genetics are far better characterized than those of other microorganisms. Recent progress in the fundamental understanding of transcription, translation, and protein folding in E. coli, together with serendipitous discoveries and the availability of improved genetic tools, are making this bacterium more valuable than ever for the expression of complex eukaryotic proteins. In the recent past nanomaterials especially gold nanomaterials are considered to revolutionize many arenas, including nanomedicine and nanodiagnostics. In this context, we aim to exploit the effect of potassium tetrachloroaurate (III) hydrate in the growth of two different E. coli systems. In addition, correlation between recombinant protein expression yields and the concentration effect is discussed. [page 9] Bartonjo, Jane J. See Badwaik, Vivek Jacob Daniel*; Novikov, Ivan; and Barzilov, Alexander \"Detection and Identification of Unknown Materials Using Neutron-Gamma Spectroscopy\" (Drs. Ivan Novikov and Alexander Barzilov) Neutron gamma spectroscopy is a non-destructive method used to analyze the chemical composition of unknown substances. A neutron interrogation system to detect and identify materials is under development at the WKU Applied Physics Institute. Neutrons emitted from the source interact with nuclei inside the interrogated container and excite them. Excited nuclei emit gamma-rays with energies specific to chemical elements. The proposed system detects these gamma-rays and makes decisions on possible chemical composition. A special algorithm was developed to simulate and analyze experimental spectra from various substances. The decision-making algorithm was developed and implemented based on obtained results. [page 7] Baxley, Jacob Daniel See Campbell, Nathan Bell, Aaron Christopher* and Gibson, Steven J. \"Seeing the Spiral from the Arms: Modeling the Interstellar Medium of the Milky Way\" (Dr. Steven J. Gibson) Our home galaxy, the Milky Way, has been a focus of astrophysical research since before we knew there were other galaxies in the universe, but in a number of ways it remains mysterious. The exact size, and spiral arm structure of the Milky Way are still poorly understood. Observation has been instrumental in uncovering what we do know about our galaxy, but theoretical models interpreting these results are also crucial. Our model tests possible relationships between different kinds of interstellar gas observed with radio telescopes. With warm atomic gas as a background, we have run a series of models with the cold atomic gas and colder molecular gas in different parts of the spiral arms, to determine how stellar evolution, involving the compression of these gases entering the arms, would appear in radio surveys. [page 9] Bell, Devon Thomas \"Past, Present, and Future of Hip Hop\" (Matt Tullis, M.F.A.) Focusing on the past, present, and future of Hip Hop music, the project consists of posters of three legends that changed societies perception of Hip Hop. The first poster is Run-DMC, who - with the help of Def Jam records, Joseph \"Run,\" Darryl \"D.M.C.,\" and Jason \"Jam-Master Jay\"- p u t Hi p Ho p o n t h e ma p . T h e n e x t p o s t e r i s o f Na s , wh o s e d e b u t a l b u m Illmatic i s considered one of the best albums in the genre.

It can also open new possibilities in the future for scientific experiments to be conducted in the field. Some of the problems we were faced with include keeping the equipment from being bombarded with neutrons using shielding and placement. Also, we had to make a frame that dispersed the weight of the equipment evenly across the ATV so it would be stable. We also designed systems to control mechanical functions like steering and braking. We approached these problems based on a past project and expanded on its successful attributes while re-engineering its failures. We were successful in creating a working, durable platform that is also very adaptable to many different experiments and weather conditions.

Anaerobic Lactobacillus sp. pep8 was grown in various media at 18 room temperature. First, Mitomycin C was used to induce any viable prophage, measured as a drop in the optical density. Second, eighteen environmental samples were collected and grown with pep8 then centrifuged and filtered to isolate phage. Plaque assays were then performed in sets of three cycles to confirm appearance of phage plaques. Sixteen environmental samples produced potential phage after multiple purifications. pep8 does not possess a viable prophage since there was no drop in optical density. After placing samples under the TEM, it was found that no phage had been isolated.

We have synthesized a series of platinum (II) compounds and then tested reactivity with DNA and protein residues. Results from this research have shown that the size and shape of the complexes affects reactivity with DNA and especially with protein residues. We are now synthesizing platinum compounds that utilize the diamine ligand N, N-dimethylethylenediamine. By changing certain variables, the yield and purity of a synthesized sample has been found to change drastically.

Since then, the price of gold has been particularly meaningful. As a true store of value, gold continues to be hoarded by those who have lost the faith, and feel the dollar is dangerous. It is the author's belief that the less secure investors feel with the dollar, the more they demand gold and the higher the price of gold will rise. An important component of the author's theory is that the gold mined in a given year (traditionally considered \"supply\") will have a negligible impact on the behavior of this price. In this paper, regression analysis with time series data is used to show conclusively that gold mining yields are not a statistically significant determinant of gold price. [page 15] Burchett, Katherine Elizabeth \"Gothic Horror Novelists\" (Matt Tullis, M.F.A.) The object of my student research project is to create effective visual communication that centers on three influential gothic horror authors in the 1800s: Bram Stoker, Mary Shelley, and Oscar Wilde. Bram Stoker is best known for his book, Dracula, which he wrote in 1897. This classic has played a major role in the popularity of vampires today. Mary Shelley wrote the best seller, Frankenstein, in 1818. Oscar Wilde is known for his novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, which he wrote in 1891. Although he wrote many plays, this was his only published novel. I propose to communicate my newfound knowledge with three pieces of digital collage art.

My visual research project focuses on the efforts of architects to change the public's idea of what a building should be. Great architecture asks us to look beyond concrete jungles and appreciate buildings for the risks they take. The resulting digital collage will show the mind-bending architectural accomplishments of Frank Gehry, Eric Owen Moss and Frank Lloyd Wright. Gehry explores the use of form and surface beyond modern definition. Moss takes existing structures and attempts to reinvent the past by generating new urban structures. Wright built the unexpected while blending the design into the surrounding landscape by using organic and local materials. These men have taken our skylines beyond what seems possible with unique design concepts that give their buildings a personal flare and set them apart from generic department stores. [page 12] M.F.A.) The objective of my research was to create fine art collagraph prints that show a study of anatomy that asks the viewer to see the parts along with the whole. The idea was to see if the viewer would recognize the animal and human body parts used to create a fantastic creature. The resulting prints began with images of collaged human and animal hands, feet, heads, and bone structures from old children's encyclopedias and old anatomy texts. These challenged the viewer to see new creatures in spite of recognizable features. Collagraph textures created a bridge between a flat paper doll and a tactile skin, blending the animal and human parts together creating one visual figure.

I argue that Snyder uses the visual elements of film to move beyond the two-dimensional paneled layout of comic book narration, all while illustrating the effects of time on the characters in the work. Drawing on examples from the movie, I explore how such cinematic techniques as match cuts and intercutting allow viewers of the film to press pause and rewind in their minds, traversing the linear narration of the graphic novel. I also examine the film's many motifs and symbols and use them to connect to the overall themes of the work, such as growing old and searching for meaning. As with the characters in the work itself, I assert that Snyder's adaptation uses the new methodologies of one media to freshen up the old.

Since the beginning of this project there has been great progress made in our understanding of the blazar phenomena, as well as great increases in the number of sources that we monitor and the equipment we use. Today one of the focuses of the project is the use of our long-term optical light curves with the gamma ray data made public by the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope to run cross correlations and discover time lags in the flaring states of the monitored blazars. Such analysis will result in a greater understanding of the dynamics occurring in the jets of these objects. In this presentation we provide a brief explanation of blazars and the equipment used before discussing the results from the initial cross correlations performed (Dr. Carol Crowe-Carraco) The Knights of the Order of St. Francis, also known as the Medmenham Monks, were a group of men who met at Medmenham Abbey in Buckinghamshire during the mid-1700s. Known for debauchery and pagan worship, it is possible that many of the rumors spread about the Friars (as the members of the group are known) are completely true, although grossly exaggerated. While a sex club for the most part, many of the rumors concerning Satan worship were untrue, possibly stemming from the activities of earlier hell-fire clubs. The actions of the Knights of the Order of St. Francis were kept very secret, and many of their activities were never revealed.

This study focused on samples from three eruptive episodes exposed in the CDCS section in order to determine the petrogenetic processes responsible for modifying the magma composition from the original source. They are more primitive compared to the rest of the complex as shown by generally low concentrations of LILE.

[page 7] Esch, Clarice*^ \"Is Collema sp., a Gelatinous Lichen, a Sustainable Source of Nitrogen for Greenhouse and Nursery Crop Production? \" (Dr. Martin Stone) Atmospheric fixation of nitrogen by terrestrial cyanobacteria is important in \"soil crusts\" of arid land ecosystems worldwide. In the absence of soil organic matter and nitrogen-fixing legumes or other higher plants, they are the primary vehicle for the introduction of nitrogen in these habitats. While some cyanobacteria dwell in soil crust matrices, others are symbionts with a fungus forming a lichen, which live above the soil line. The gelatinous lichen, Collema sp., is native to Warren County, Kentucky inhabiting bare soil. During periods of sufficient soil moisture, it fixes nitrogen and photosynthesizes and its appearance is altered from a dry, hard flake to hydrated, swollen, and jelly-like. Our hypothesis suggests that Collema sp, could be utilized as a partial replacement for nitrogen fertilizer in greenhouse and nursery crops where it would inhabit the surface of the potting media and contribute nitrogen continuously at each watering event. The results of greenhouse studies will be presented and implications discussed. [page 9] Evans, Jesse W. See Badwaik, Vivek. in Graduate Abstracts Evans, Jesse W. See Bartonjo, Jane J.

I analyze the ambiguity of Hawthorne's symbols, the dubious nature of the morality of his characters and how different understandings of each could affect an individual's reading of Hawthorne's work. With regard to Young Goodman Brown, the religious symbolism and Goodman Brown's questionable behavior are explored. The blemish which gives The Birth-mark its name is considered alongside Aylmer's controversial morality. The ambiguous Biblical allusion contained within Rappaccini's Daughter is examined in relation to the morality it defines in respect to the characters.

His long literary career is dissected, from the satiric comedy La Cortigiana to his infamous lust sonnets to his religious books and his letters of blackmail received by princes and priests. Like a Shakespearean hero, he was a larger-than-life character of enormous influence whose demise could perhaps be attributed to his hubris. But unlike Macbeth, Aretino seems to have suffered a worse kind of death: the death of his artistic immortality, his name. Only recently have scholars agreed to unearth Aretino, reevaluate him, brush away virulent labels, and, perhaps, to give this fascinating Renaissance shadow a sliver of the illumination which he has long been denied. [page 8] Fields, Ashton See Patel, Khushbu 21 Fite, Jin; and Drummond, Adam \"New Ways of Learning\" (Dr. Sheila Flener) When starting the research process for the IDEC project out most important goal was to exhaust all of our resources. Knowing that WKU's campus is host to two libraries itself we took a trip to visit someone who would understand the workings and necessities of our project. While at the library we were able to talk to Brent Long. Mr. Long helped us to understand what modern libraries needed to include to stay up to date with today's every changing technology. We researched different ideas for flooring and for furniture that could be included in both the individual meeting room and in the cafe. One website that proved to be extremely helpful with this was freshome.com. When thinking of a design concept we decided to include a Japanese flare to our design. Some websites that helped us accomplish this are orientalfurniture.com and japanesestylelighting.com. Since we had already taken a look at Western's campus we thought it might be beneficial to look at some libraries in other colleges around the U.S. so we looked at the learning commons at North Carolina State University. We found information at ncsu.edu that helped us get an idea of the relationship of space in a floor plan of this sort. This proved to be a helpful starting place to formulating a design that would be both pleasing to the eye and efficient. Design Concept Statement: A university library is busy place and is not used only for study anymore. A library in today's modern world must be adaptability to new technologies and incorporate new elements, such as computers, Wi-Fi internet, and new entertainment media like CDs and DVDs. The library still must have the common necessities of a library like a common area for students, a quiet area for study, and even a small area for those spending long periods of time in the building. The tranquility of the Japanese culture would seem most appropriate to use in the calm, quiet place. The colors and materials used will be relaxing and soothing making it a place where not only where students will have to study but a place where students will want to study.

Seven samples were chosen, which had been collected in stratigraphic order from a glacially-encised valley on the southern side of the complex. Whole-rock geochemistry and petrographic analysis confirm that the andesites (wt% SiO2 = 50.4 \u00e2\u20ac\"53.03; wt% MgO = 3.9 - 5.8), and tholeiitic in affinity. Concentrations of both compatible and incompatible elements are relatively low for SVZ basalts. Samples are dominated by plagioclase feldspars, many of which exhibit seriate texture, and sparsely olivine- a n d p y r o x e n e-phyric. Textures (compositional zoning, mantling, resorption, etc.) in some lavas are consistent with changes in the magma chemistry during cooling prior to ascent and eruption.

Suppose that one is standing on the edge of an elliptical \"pond,\" that is, where the area enclosed by the ellipse is composed of one media and the area outside the ellipse is composed of another media, and that one has different rates of travel through these media. What is the optimal path to travel from one point on the ellipse to another, given the eccentricity of the ellipse and the rates of travel through the separate media? Surprising results arise in the case for the ellipse of eccentricity 0, a circular \"pond.\"[page 7] Fowler, Etching\" (Dr. Cambron, Dettman, M.S., and Ron Rizzo, B.S.)

Trumpetfish serve as an ideal organism for determining the pattern of suction generation inside the buccal cavity. In fish with elongated skulls or jaws, there is a potential trade-off with feeding performance that likely shapes their feeding behavior. By employing pressure transducers implanted in the back and front of the buccal cavity, we observed that: 1)the pressure is initially generated in the back, 2)there is an average drop in pressure of -5.42kPa, and 3)there is a 4ms time delay between the two peaks. We hypothesize that evolution of body-length sesamoid tendons has allowed trumpetfishes to overcome the potential trade-off between body shape and subambient pressure translation.

A Microsoft Visual Basic GUI was used to be the program that controls the ATV Platform's functions of starting, stopping, moving forward and backward, turning left and right, and shifting up and down in gear. There were several program glitches, which included incorrect order of code, improper use of subroutines, missing delays, and incorrect Boolean logic.

Phage are the most abundant biological entities on earth, but only a small fraction have been identified and studied. To perform our experiment we used Mycobacterium smegmatis a s t h e h o s t . A soil sample was collected from my backyard in Radcliff, Kentucky. Mycobacteriophages were recovered from the soil sample by looking for plaques on a lawn of the bacterial host. A single plaque was picked and subjected to a phage infection and plating procedure to ensure that a single phage type was recovered. An electron microscope was used to examine the morphology of the purified phage which was named \"Backyardigan\" to reflect the sampling location. The genomic DNA of Backyardigan was isolated and analyzed and the complete DNA sequence was determined. Students in the Genome Discovery and Exploration class will annotate the genome using tools. \"Discovering New Genomes in the Soil\" (Drs.

The purpose of research conducted in the Genome Discovery and Exploration class, was to find novel bacteriophages that could specifically infect and grow on the bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis. A soil sample was collected from Saunder Springs Nature Preserve in Radcliff, KY. The presence of phage in the soil was determined by looking for plaque formation on a lawn of M. smegmatis cells. The phage was purified and named \"Spring\" to reflect the sampling location. Electron microscopy was used to characterize the morphology of the phage and to insure that only a single type was present. The genomic DNA from Spring was isolated and the concentration was determined with a spectrophotometer. The phage DNA was digested with restriction enzymes and the products were examined by gel electrophoresis. The results of this analysis suggest that Spring is a unique bacteriophage.

Changes in adsorbate mass over time were noted and converted to reflect the percent coverage on the substrate by estimating the surface area occupied by individual molecules. Trends in the rate of adsorption were observed that are correlated to the length of the alkyl chain. As this length increases the rate of adsorption decreases for each of the carbon substrates. Differences in adsorption rates were also observed as a function of the carbon allotrope. These differences can be understood qualitatively as being related to the surface geometry.

The location and expression of cyclin dependant kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) in response to endothelin-1 was determined by immunofluorescence techniques in primary cultures of BCEC. Confluent and actively growing cells were treated with 20nM endothelin-1 for 24h and fixed in 4% paraformaldahyde. Cells were incubated overnight with rabbit anti-p27kip1 followed by a goat anti rabbit-FITC conjugate. Fluorescence microscopy revealed a distinct nuclear localization of p27kip1 in confluent, contact inhibited cells. The nuclear staining was greatly reduced in actively growing cells. Treatment of BCEC with endothelin-1 resulted in a reduction in the nuclear localization of p27kip1. Endothelin-1 down-regulation of p27kip1 may promote cell cycle progression and subsequent cell proliferation.

Since the anthology's cutoff point ends abruptly at 1922, only Stevens's first book, Harmonium, arguably his most brilliant work, is represented. Even so, the poems in the anthology fail to show Stevens's early variation of theme and style, his wide range of voice and perspective that makes these poems essentially 24 modern. Thus, this selection of Stevens chosen by Mandelbaum and Richardson is dry and boring, not a unique or even appropriate representation of Stevens's imaginative innovation within the art of poetry.

Wound healing in the presence of 5-FU assesses the contribution of cell migration to wound healing. BCEC were isolated from bovine eyes and grown in cell culture. Wound healing was examined in confluent BCEC after mechanical wounding. Cultures treated with 100nM ET-1 and/or 10uM 5-FU, and were photographed at 0, 24, 48 and 72h post-wound. The wound area (um2) of each culture was determined using image analysis software. Cultures treated with ET-1 heal significantly faster (46%) than controls, whereas those treated with 5-FU healed significantly slower (33%) than controls. ET-1 stimulated wound healing 10.8% in the presence of 5-FU suggesting that ET-1 may enhance cell migration in addition to promoting cell proliferation. [page 8] Kearns, B. Joe See Stinson, Chasity Kerr, Brandon Keith \"Robot Positioning\" (Dr. Stacy Wilson) In the field of mobile robots positioning and location are essential to the operation of a robot. Two categories that robot positioning can be divided into are relative and absolute positioning. Each category has different challenges and limitations as well as advantages. There is no simple solution to creating a perfect positioning system. Developers often have to combine techniques in order to achieve the required accuracy and performance of a positioning system. This project focuses on researching the different techniques that are available or are being studied. After comparing each method, a system will be created by choosing a method, or a combination of, that seems more viable. This will be demonstrated by showing that it is capable of determining position, orientation, and direction of travel of a device as it moves around a room.

We aim to determine whether the relationship between these concepts is reflected in semantic networks in the brain. In order to determine these semantic relationships, a lexical decision task was formed using a list of words rated as highly related to aggression and a list of words rated as highly related to sexuality. If aggression and sexuality are semantically linked, we expect to find significantly shorter reaction times for sexual targets preceded by aggressive primes than for neutral primes, as well as shorter times for aggressive targets preceded by sexual primes than for neutral primes. Preliminary results suggest that aggressive words inhibit priming of sexual targets and suggest a general priming effect by sexual words. [page 5] King, Stephen*^ James Koeneman, Molly* \"Backstage Housewives in Barn Burning\" (Dr. Walker Rutledge) Females in William Faulkner's short story Barn Burning fit the traditional role of the time period: backstage housewife. Though the role is standard, the way in which the Barn Burning women live in their role is different. Mrs. Snopes - submissive housewife to the contemptible Abner - and Mrs. de Spain - matriarch in her household even over her husband, the Major de Spain - serve as foils for one another as powerless and powerful, victim and victimizer, silent and outspoken. Neither woman is heard nor seen very often, but their influence is perceivable in the actions of their men and the way in which men act under their influence. [page 5] Kuan, I-Ping \"Legend Puppeteer\" (Matt Tullis, M.F.A.) The objective of my research is to create effective visual communication that centers on these puppeteers from different nations and generations. My project will focus on the master puppeteers, Li Tien-lu of Taiwan, Jiri Trnka of the Czech Republic, and Jim Henson of U.S.A. Master Li is one of t h e m o s t f a m o u s T a i w a n e s e h a n d p u p p e t e e r s , u s i n g t h e t r a d i t i o n a l s t y l e o f performing. Jiri Trnka is known as \"the Walt Disney of East.\" He is internationally recognized as the world's greatest puppet animator. Finally, Jim Henson is one of the most known puppeteers in American history. He adapted ancient art of puppetry to modern television. Puppets confront fears, improvise, and move audiences to new worlds. In order to show the contributions of these puppeteers, I use digital collage to present different culture styles of puppets and technology.

In my research I studied Albus Dumbledore and compared him with the Holy trinity. Through his benevolence, sacrifice, and guidance he portrays the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Through study of the Holy Bible, Christian journals, and the books themselves, one can argue that this character represents something far greater than a humble wizard of children's fiction.

My student research project is to create effective visual communication that informs about three great composers during Classical and Romantic eras. The resulting written report and three digital collages will focus on Beethoven, Mozart, and 25 Haydn. Their works are still played by many orchestras. Most people recognize Beethoven's \"Symphony Aaron \"Synthesis and Ion Exchange of Potassium Our research concentrates on synthesis and ion exchange of nanoporous TsG-1 structure, which poses remarkably high ion selectivity for cesium, even in very low concentrations (~10 parts per million cesium) in concentrated alkaline solutions typical of spent nuclear fuel. Briefly, upon ion exchange the TsG-1 material locks in the cesium into its nanoporous crystalline framework, which in turn distorts, and does not allow the release of the ion back to the environment; thus effectively sequestering cesium from solution. The remaining waste could then be stored using more conventional systems. This talk will detail the structure of the TsG-1 material, ion sequestration and selectivity mechanisms, and future directions for material synthesis. [page 14] Li, Yan Fen \"Synthesis and Structures of Two Novel Organic-Inorganic Hybrid Compounds Containing Polyoxometalates and Ruthenium(II) Complexes\" (Dr. Bangbo Yan) Polyoxometallates (POMs), which are metal oxide cluster anions with discrete structures, have been extensively studied due to their potential applications as catalysts, sorbents, electronic materials, and medicine. The mononuclear ruthenium (II) complex [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy = 2,2'- bipyridyl) is photoactive and capable of proton-coupled electron transfer reactions. We are interested in the synthesis of hybrid materials containing POMs and [Ru(bpy)3]2+ , and to investigate the ability of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ to photosensitize the near-UV absorbing polyoxometallates with the ultimate objective of exploiting their photocatalytic ability on splitting water. Here, we describe two new organic-inorganic hybrid compounds of polyoxometallates. Compound 1, [Ru(bpy)3]2[Mo8O26]6H2O, was synthesized from the reaction of [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 with molybdic acid under hydrothermal condition. Compound 2, [Ru(bpy)3][W6O19], was synthesized from the reaction of cis-bis (2,2'-bipyridyl) hydrate, 2,2'-bipyridyl and sodium metatungstate monohydrate under hydrothermal condition. These compounds have been characterized by elemental analysis, UV-Vis, fluorescence, thermogravimetric analysis and Madison*^ See Delomas, Thomas Lindsey, Amy \"Success of Silence of the Lambs: Why We Love Serial Killers\" (Dr. Ted Hovet) Clarice Starling may be the most important part of the success of Jonathan Demme's Silence of the Lambs (1991). The film allows its audience to relate to Clarice in various ways and helps us feel as if we are helping her catch the criminals. Movies such as this give us comfort in knowing that in the end there is always a resolution because the \"good guys\" always win. The film originated as a novel written by Thomas Harris in 1988. People are naturally attracted to serial killers whether they are real or fictional. The film's popularity is also due to the multitudes of serial killer activity during the 1980s and 1990s, and the massive amounts of media coverage given to these killers. I have researched how the film makes us identify with Clarice Starling and how it relates to the media coverage of the serial killers in the 80s and 90s.

This instrument was recently paired with a LabVIEW based software application to provide a modern user interface for acquiring and analyzing XRD data. We are presently modifying the LabVIEW applications to include procedures for routine calibration of the XRD to detect any systematic error in the angle at which measurements are taken, and then to correct this error with an appropriate offset. In this presentation, I will speak about the procedures and safety precautions involved in operating the XRD as well as the fundamentals of XRD analysis. The development and progress of the calibration software will also be discussed. [page 7] Long, Courtney \"American Pop Art Artists\" (Matt Tullis, M.F.A.) The focus of my student research project is to create effective visual communication focusing on the works of three American Pop Art artists from the 19th century. I propose to communicate my research by creating three different digital design collages of my three subjects. The three American Pop Art artists I chose to research are Roy Lichtenstein, Jim Dine, and Robert Rauschenberg. I chose Roy Lichtenstein because he was familiar with American Culture and helped develop the Pop Art movement. I chose Jim Dine because he uses traditional painting techniques with a mix of collage, printing, etching, and papermaking. Lastly, I chose Robert Rauschenberg because he used unusual colors and a variety of junkyard objects that he found. [page 12] Looper, Amy \"My Life as Alice\" (Dr. Dale Rigsby) This is an experimental creative non-fiction essay that fuses research with memoir and literature. The paper explores research that details the many negative effects of frequent moving on children. Centering my essay on memories of numerous relocations in my own childhood, I provide real life examples of these adverse effects. In addition to the research element of this paper, I compare my life experiences to that of Alice's as chronicled in Lewis Carroll's popular tale, Alice's Adventures in 26 Wonderland. I reveal how each move took me further and further down the \"rabbit-hole\" and how I eventually landed in a \"Wonderland of sorts, where I was never the right size, never in control, and nothing ever made sense.\" While this work showcases my struggles, it also offers hope that children can, like me, ultimately overcome them. [page 5] Lowery, Gerald See Vanover, Eric Scott Malone, \"Convective vs. Non-Convective Wind Events: A WRF-Based Comparison\" (Dr. Josh Durkee) High-wind events are frequent and dangerous phenomena responsible for widespread damages, injuries, and casualties across the U.S. each year. These events are commonly associated with severe convective storms (or convective wind events) during the warm season. However, non-convective high-wind events have been shown to produce hazardous outcomes similar in magnitude to hurricanes, particularly during the cool season. This study uses the Weather Research and Forecast model to provide a descriptive comparison between convective and non-convective wind events. B o t h h i g h-wind classifications occur throughout the year, with the highest frequency of occurrence for convective and non-convective wind events during the warm and cool-season months, respectively. Another important difference is non-convective wind events are typically synoptic in scale (widespread and longer-lived), while convective wind events are more localized with shorter durations. However, both high-wind events are largely associated with the passage of mid-latitude cyclones. Convective wind events commonly occur as pre-frontal events within the warm sector of mid-latitude cyclones, while non-convective wind events occur in the wake of advancing cold fronts. Output data from the model simulations indicate that mid-latitude cyclone dynamics play an important role in the formation of a high frequency of both types of events. [page 10] Marquardt, Joseph R.* \"Molecular Tools for Understanding the Population Genetic Effects of Habitat Restoration\" (Dr. Jeffrey Marcus) Habitat isolation and fragmentation has been found to lead to restrictions in gene flow between fragmented butterfly populations. Much of the fragmentation in south central Kentucky is the result of extensive grazing and other agriculture uses of natural habitats. The Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) aims to remedy this problem, among others, by replanting natural vegetation destroyed by grazing and initiating land use changes away from agriculture. Six butterfly species are used; two believed to be directly affected by the seed plantings, two believed to be indirectly affected by land use changes, and two unaffected by the process. The use of a genetic fingerprinting technique known as Randomly Amplified Fingerprints (RAF) was used to study the population structure of these butterflies. [page 14] Marsh, Danielle \"Analysis of Sediments Exposed above the Barren River, Bowling Green, KY\" (Dr. Andrew Wulff) Samples for this analysis were collected from an exposure of layered sediments in Bowling Green, KY. Samples were collected from two areas of the outcrop: the middle and lower clay units, as well as from the Barren River. Characterization of each sample site was done using standard sediment sieves, Malvern Particle Size Analyzer, and XRD analysis. The goal of this research is to determine the flow regime as well as of the source material of the clay particles. Data obtained from a grain size analysis of the Barren River sample revealed that grains were poorly sorted; strongly coarse skewed. The clay-sized particles were further analyzed using the Malvern Particle Size Analyzer to reveal all aspects of the particles on a more defined scale. Standard Operating Procedures were developed for future students in Earth Science studies. [page 7] Marsh, Delomas, Thomas McCann, Sarah \"The Influences of Wind Velocity in Hidden River Cave\" (Dr. Chris Groves) Wind in caves can be caused by a number of factors: barometric pressure or temperature differences between the surface and cave, ice chambers below cave rooms, resonance, or wind blowing through the cave. A steady wind in a passageway has been felt in Hidden River Cave and it is hypothesized that meteorological conditions on the surface affect the wind velocity in the cave. Wind velocity readings for the entrance, three rooms and passageways were taken using an anemometer, as well as temperature using an infrared thermometer. Surface weather conditions collected every five minutes and recorded in a data logger were obtained for analysis and later compared with data collected in the cave. Evidence suggests that the temperature differences between the surface and the cave caused the wind, and the barometric pressure influenced it.

The fodder of political cartoons, letters, and newspapers of the time period provide a vast source of primary material that draws a picture of sexuality. Homosexuality has been conceived as an immoral act since medieval times, but varying degrees of homosexuality have been preserved in British culture. Ranging from mollies to female husbands, homosexuality took an assortment of forms in the time frame of the Hanoverians. The different forms of homosexuality observed exemplify the cultural and societal reactions to homosexuality when the acts were flaunted or hidden from view.

In the investigation, we came across a new way of modeling the problem, using weights, essentially creating a weighted average. We developed some interesting formulae for finding the average depth of shapes based upon the form of an equation \" E i g e n-analysis of Microbial Networks Added to Food Webs\" (Drs. Albert J. Meier and Bruce Kessler) Food webs are the best method for depicting prey and predator interactions among species in an ecosystem. Food webs can be depicted in adjacency matrices where 0's represent no direct interaction and 1's represent a direct interaction. The number of indirect pathways of length n within a system is calculated by performing a power series of n on the adjacency matrix of the system. The number of indirect pathways increases with increasing path length. We analyzed the direct pathways of an adjacency matrix and calculated an eigenvalue. We added a bacterial loop to an already existing food web which dramatically increased eigenvalues and pathway proliferation. Pathway proliferation may be one of the great roles of bacteria in ecosystems.

With the gamma ray scintillometer, a measurement of the radioactivity of sedimentary rocks above and below a major unconformity or sequence boundary was able to be obtained. The gamma ray plot generated at Shanty Hollow was correlated to a gamma ray profile constructed for strata located along HWY 185, near the Green River. Upon inspection, I found that what was believed to be Waltersburg Sandstone from the Mississippian Period is most probably Caseyville Sandstone from the Pennsylvanian Period. The data collected adds to the state geological record and allows for informed drilling for unconventional resources - such as tar sands, asphalts, and heavy oil - associated with the sequence boundary.

Vladimir Dobrokhotov and Alexander Barzilov) An electronic nose is a biologically inspired device that identifies and analyses chemical compounds in gaseous environments. Electronic nose technology has many potential uses in the food industry where it could help maximize product quality and reduce production costs. An electronic nose consists of a mechanism for chemical detection, such as an array of electronic sensors, and a mechanism for pattern recognition, such as a neural network. Currently research is focused on making the devices smaller, less expensive, and more sensitive. It became possible thanks to the application of nanostructures in electronic nose technology. In this presentation we discuss the possibilities of sufficient improvement of sensitivity and selectivity of electronic noses using novel nanomaterials.

To better understand the process and clear misconceptions, this work will analyze the process of gaining access according to the literature of Henson \"Gaining Access: Congress and the Farm Lobby.\" The focus is on four important factors: competitive advantage, cost-efficiency, effectiveness and recurrence. The results show that without consistent growth of competitive advantage based on numerous factors, without cost efficient and effective service, and a topic that re-occurs on the agenda, interest groups cannot gain access in Congress. [page 5] Olberding, Jordan*; Rodney King and Claire Rinehart) Bacteriophage (phage) are viruses that infect bacterial hosts. They are extremely abundant, yet most are unclassified. Phage use bacteria to replicate, and then lyse the host cell to release the newly-assembled viruses. The goal of the experiments conducted in the Genome Discovery and Exploration program was to add to the scientific community's database of characterized phage. A novel phage was isolated from a soil sample taken from Western's campus. Mycobacteriophages were detected in the soil sample, by growing them on the host bacterium, Mycobacterium smegmatis. After incubation, plaques (clear areas in the bacterial lawn where lysis has occurred) were visible. From the many plaque morphologies observed on the plates, a single plaque type was chosen. The phage from the plaque were purified extensively. The genomic DNA of the newly isolated phage 28 (named Luci) was extracted and analyzed. The results of the DNA analysis suggest that Luci is a unique mycobacteriophage. [page (Dr. Sandra Hughes) Studying Nathaniel Hawthorne's works often means being subjected to short stories filled with ambiguous characters, plots, endings, and themes. Hawthorne makes use of moral, linguistic, and symbolic ambiguity in many of his most well known works, such as Roger Malvin's Burial, Young Goodman Brown, and Rappaccini's Daughter. Hawthorne's works prove difficult to wade through on their own, but in these particular tales the prevalence of ambiguity creates wide differences in interpretation; however, dissecting the effect of ambiguity on the outcome of these stories proves to be most rewarding. This paper explores the role of ambiguity in Hawthorne's works and how its use ultimately makes the reader search harder for an explanation in some of Hawthorne's tales.

Our current goal is to constrain the ages (partly constrained by morphological types) and metallicities of galaxies that hosted type Ia supernovae during the survey, to better understand the progenitor mechanisms for these supernovae. I will present the morphology measures of the host galaxies using a program, GALFIT, to quantify the light profiles using S\u00e9rsic indices. I will compare these to galaxies that did not host supernovae to find a correlation in supernova rates and galaxy properties. Our results should improve the understanding of initial conditions for rates of type Ia supernovae in galaxies in the local universe.

Bronze casting sculptures using natural materials such as twigs, flowers, seed pods, and vines is the focus of my research. Using these small, delicate, and sometimes brittle items are especially difficult to cast. I cast this material in the time-honored and traditional Lost Wax Method. This involves waxing the plant material and then wax welding them together into the basic form. After gating the form by adding a pour spout, the wax form is then placed into a plaster mold. The material is then burned out in a kiln. In place of the form is a negative space which is filled with molten bronze. The bronze is then broken out of the mold. Removing the gating with a grinder, the bronze is now ready for a patina. Bronze is a traditional material that I use for contemporary art. Experimenting with the material is a great way to expand my work.

It is classified as a metalloid meaning that is has the appearance and some properties of metal. Arsenic is found in trace amounts in rocks, animals, water, soils and plants - virtually everywhere. Arsenic can also be found in wood preservatives, dyes, drugs, soaps, semiconductors, herbicides and poisons. Arsenic naturally occurs in the earth's soil and be distributed by air and water. Chemical plants such as coal and power plants help to create such a dangerous chemical to get into the air and water. There are many ways we can handle this issue and do this by going to state representatives and showing them how much of an issue this is. We can also get with other Universities to do studies, show the public evidence, and write letters to the Government to prove to them that is has to be dealt with.

To meet the needs of current and future residents, resident's physical activity levels and their expectations were examined. The PASE survey was administered to develop a profile of current physical activity. One focus group was held to develop themes relating to residents' current desires. Results showed that compared to the theoretical recommendations for this age group, resident's current activity levels were less. Their desires for specific physical activity programs were not being met. This presentation concludes with recommendations for fitness area enhancement to increase the likelihood of residents meeting proposed physical activity levels.

The objective of my presentation is to discuss why such scientific theories challenge Flanagan's argument by first discussing the Buddhist view of the self, then demonstrating how the nature of a 4th dimension would distort it. After discussing these fundamentals, I will demonstrate the validity of Flanagan's argument and explain how he manages to parallel the scientific and Buddhist views of the self. To explain how the concept of self would change in the 4th dimension, I will show a video clip of a lecture given by Carl Sagan, in which he explains the 4th dimension as a theoretical view. I conclude that if future sciences are to consider the 4th dimension as a property of reality, then the concepts of self in science and Buddhism will be drastically opposed to one another. Since my argument is based on theories that are not yet proven, and possibly will never be, one should interpret my argument as a theoretical and conjectural attempt to approach the notion that science and Buddhism parallel one another with skepticism.

The largest source of Mercury is atmospheric deposition, largely produced by coal-fired power plants. Over 350 individual bat hair samples have been analyzed for Hg with a wide variety in species diversity. Our project has expanded to three more national parks in the Kentucky and Tennessee area. Hg levels in the hair of different bat species, including federally listed endangered species, have been determined and found to range between 1-13 ppm. In addition to bat hair, several bat guano samples have been analyzed for Hg and found to range from 0.0030 ppm to 0.9470 ppm. Further analysis has been performed on insects to gain additional information regarding how bats bio-accumulate Hg through the food chain. Sediment samples have also been analyzed for Mercury. Quality analysis and quality control tests were done using human hair reference standards. [page 10] Sales, Trevor Alan \"Classic Comedy\" (Matt Tullis, M.F.A.)

The Lost River Cave System is an important feature of the karst landscape on which Bowling Green, Kentucky is developed. Because karst is vulnerable to human impact, georeferenced cave maps are important to help identify sources of water pollution and other impacts. This team project focuses on georeferencing the Lost River Cave System and associated features. GPS coordinates of cave entrances, sinkholes, springs, karst windows, and other karst features is being mapped against a physical map of the area using GIS. Standard cave survey techniques is being used to define size, shape, and location of conduits. Once data is collected, the information will be organized using GIS to georeference the data and organize photos and field descriptions. The Lost River GIS can function as a tool for land management and development decision-making.

Plath's, as well as the speaker's, relationship with her father and her own German heritage create an intricate and precarious relationship with the poem's Holocaust imagery and language. The speaker pits herself against her dead father by labeling herself as a Jew, and dubbing her father a demonic \"man in black with a Meinkampf look,\" to be able to finally mourn her father's untimely death. Plath struggled to balance life as a mother, wife, and writer, expressed in the frustration with the male figures throughout the poem. After studying Daddy v i a b i o g r a p h i c a l , p s y c h o l o g i c a l , a n d f eminist literary approaches, it emerges as a complex, fascinating poem, rich in its multi-contextual meaning. [page (Drs. Rodney King and Claire Rinehart) The Genome Discovery and Exploration class was composed of 20 novice scientists who were challenged to isolate and characterize novel bacteriophages from the environment. Our goal was to isolate phages that specifically infect Mycobacterium smegmatis, a common soil bacterium. Each student purified their phage to homogeneity and assigned a name to their discovery. I named my phage Hortensius Cato 9. High titer lysates were prepared and the phage particles in these lysates 31 were examined by electron microscopy to determine their morphological characteristics. Phage Genomic DNA was isolated and the amount of DNA recovered was determined spectrophotometrically. The DNA was analyzed by using restriction enzymes to cut the DNA and the resulting fragments were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The DNA sequence of two bacteriophages isolated in the class will be determined. We will annotate the genomes of these phages by identifying all the viral genes using the tools of bioinformatics. [page 10] Schrader, Novel Mycobacteriophage Isolated from the Soil\" (Drs. Rodney King and Claire Rinehart) Bacteriophages are the most abundant organisms on earth, and yet very few types have been characterized. The objective of this experiment was to isolate and characterize a novel bacteriophage from the environment. Mycobacterium smegmatis, a harmless bacterium commonly found in soil, served as the host and facilitated the enrichment and recovery of mycobacteriophages. The presence of phage was confirmed by the appearance of clear, circular plaques on a lawn of bacteria. A single phage type was purified to homogeneity and was designated TiroTheta9. The purified TiroTheta9 phage particles were visualized by electron microscopy. TiroTheta9 genomic DNA was isolated and analyzed using a spectrophotometer, DNA restriction enzymes and gel electrophoresis. Based on this data, we conclude that TiroThet9 is a unique mycobacteriophage. These experiments were conducted over the course of a semester in the Genome Discovery and Exploration class.

Individual substrates were maintained in the temperature range 50-200 \u00c2\u00b0C during growth of these ultra-thin films. In a series of AFM studies the microstructure evolution of the adsorbed films can be observed as a function of substrate temperature during deposition. Included in our observations are needle-like structures and platelets of p-sexiphenyl that can be related to the substrate temperature during deposition. The needles are approximately aligned along the [110] direction of the KCl (001) surface. The results are reproducible and suggest that ultrathin films of p-6P molecules can be grown with desired molecular orientations by carefully selecting the appropriate substrate temperature during deposition.

Nevertheless, one might find Didion's prose shelved in the \"self-improvement\" section at bookstores. Didion's memoir chronicles her bereavement process after the death of her husband, John Gregory Dunne. Yet make no mistake, The Year of Magical Thinking is not another 12-step program. Didion's memoir will be examined as a \"gr i ef account , \" mor e speci fi cal l y, deat h expl or ed t hr ough memoi r ( Denni s 802). This study will use research into the self-improvement, memoir, and grief account genres to illustrate how Didion's work differs from self-improvement literature.

We were able to optimize the reaction conditions to prepare smaller size nanoparticles in sizes ranging from 20 nm to 80 nm in size. These fluorescent nanoparticles are highly advantageous due to the significant load of covalently attached dye and high solubility in a wide range of solvents and medium.

The benefits of using metalloporphyrins as building blocks for synthesis of supramolecules are their photochemical excitations and rich redox chemistry. On the other hand, polyoxometalates have been shown to act as photocatalysts for water splitting. Our hope is that once successful binding of these molecules is achieved, excited electrons from porphyrin molecules will transfer to polyoxometalates and catalyze the reduction of water to produce hydrogen. Using a molecular building block approach, we have synthesized a new compound containing a metalloporphyrin complex and a polyoxotungstate cluster unit.

Smith) Catfishes of the family Loricariidae have bi-lobed swim bladders that are adjacent to their ears. We hypothesize this anatomical design assists these fishes in sound localization. Previous experiments demonstrated that the loricariid catfish Otocinclus affinis c o u l d b e t r a i n e d v i a o p e r a n t c o n d i t i o n i n g t o a p p r o a c h a s p e a k e r p r o d u c i n g c o n s p e c i f i c s o u n d s . T w e n t y-six trained fish were used to test the acuity of this sound localization by randomizing a conspecific sound-stimulus through four speakers mounted along the edge of a round tank and videotaping fish behavior. Fish were acclimated for five min., exposed to the sound for five min., and then recorded for another five min. At the beginning of each trial, 19 out of 26 fish (73%) swam to the correct sound-producing speaker first. Fish spent significantly more time near the sound-producing speaker than the other three speakers. These experiments demonstrated that O. affinis can localize sound. Twenty-four trained fish were then used to test whether swim bladder deflation would affect sound localization. To test this we used the same setup and recorded the behavior of fourteen un-deflated (control) fish which resulted in 100% accuracy for localizing the correct speaker. We then deflated the swim 33 bladders of the remaining ten fish, and 0% of the fish went to the correct speaker. In conclusion, swim bladders do play a role in sound localization of O. affinis, and once deflated, they have difficulty in localizing a conspecific sound. Future experiments will further study the sound localization acuity of O. affinis.

Other SEM images illustrate that these tubes may be overlain by and intercalated with rhomboidal crystals. EDS and XRD establish the mineralogy of the tube sheaths and the crystal overgrowth as FeOx and CaCO3, respectively. A calcite tablet exposed directly to the cave water and a second encased in a chamber with a filter were left in the cave for nearly five months during the winter of 2007-08. Neither sample lost mass during the experiment, nor were etchings or borings detected in the sample exposed to microbial activity.

Rodney King and Claire Rinehart) Through the WKU Biology Department's Genome Discovery and Exploration Program, I was able to isolate a unique mycobacteriophage from a soil sample. Bacteriophage are viruses that use a specific bacterium as a host to generate new phage particles. The bacterial host used in the class, Mycobacterium smegmatis, is a common inhabitant of soil. Through a series of experiments, I was able to purify a single phage type. The newly discovered phage was named Agkelos, which means \"angel\" in Greek. This name was chosen because the plaques formed by the phage had a faint halo around a turbid center. After harvesting large numbers of Agkelos phage particles, I was able to characterize the morphology of the phage using an electron microscope. The genomic DNA from Agkelos was extracted and analyzed by spectrophotometry, DNA restriction enzymes, and gel electrophoresis. These results showed that Agkelos was different from the phages discovered by other students in the Genome Discovery and Exploration class. [page Joshua; and Mahmood, Rezaul \"Urbanization and Its Impacts on Precipitation around Three Urban Centers in the Kentucky-Ohio River Valley\" (Dr. Rezaul Mahmood) It is well known that urbanization produces urban heat island (UHI) effect which resulted in higher air temperatures compared to outlying rural areas. This effect has the potential to alter convection and enhance precipitation in areas downwind of large cities. This is due primarily to urban and industrial development. This study was conducted to measure the degree of enhancement of precipitation in 3 cities: Evansville, Indiana; Louisville, Kentucky; and Cincinnati, Ohio. The scope of this research was from the months of June to August during the years of 1998-2009. Tropical Rainfall Measurement Data (TRMM) was used to provide time-series sensitive anomaly products that displayed evidence of possible enhancement of precipitation in and around these three urban areas. Initial results indicate potential modification of localized precipitation regime during the years of 1998, 2001, 2005, and 2006. We conclude that further investigation is needed to better understand these outcomes.

A special case of interest in interstitial brachytherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer is the sensitivity of the cancerous prostate cells to radiation compared to that of healthy prostate cells, which are more likely to be affected by the radiation than the cancerous tissue. We studied the effectiveness of radiation treatment as a function of the size of radiation sources and their distribution in a treated volume. The dose distribution was calculated using Monte Carlo Neutron Propagation simulation software (MCNP5). The effectiveness of the dose distribution was estimated from published survival models for healthy and cancerous tissues. In the presented work, we are discussing the obtained results.

Typically, Disney films are animated adaptations of classic fairy tales. Hans Christian Andersen's children's story Dem Lille Havfrue i s Di s n e y-fied via The Little Mermaid. While they are both tales of headstrong females, the translation from word to screen doesn't convey the same message about these young women and the worlds in which they live. Alternations within the concepts of body image, the conventions of matriarchy and patriarchy, and to the character of Ariel herself from the nineteenth century version to the modern-day cinematic romance demonstrate Disney's specific, restrictive view of the female heroine. Thorough examination of this film proves the Disney version to be less progressive than Andersen's tale, suggesting that an American audience would shy away from progressive women's fiction in order to maintain the art of social conditioning.

The late 1980s and early 1990s witnessed the fall of The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the chain of socialist countries in Central and Eastern Europe, and also observed a sharp increase in the number of countries abandoning their central planning economy models and moving towards market-based economies. Most transitions share common negative and positive characteristics, and in spite of high expectations, at the beginning, the transition process did not bring back positive changes (Young). The long and pain-taking process only pays off in the long run. The transition process of Vietnam bears many similarities to those of other transition economies. After a slow-growing period, more positive consequences are observed.

Underneath the surface of the Southern sentimental pastoral lies a dark undercurrent of racism and oppression, echoing lines of 35 the grotesque imagery in Billie Holiday's Strange Fruit. My ecocritical analysis of Southern writers' use of tree symbolism begins with an examination of Zora Neale Hurston's novel Their Eyes Were Watching God, then uncovers ethereal, barren landscapes that haunt the works of such Southerners as Lewis Nordan, Eudora Welty and Richard Wright, concluding that trees of Southern literature are valuable non-human structures that tie characters to the heritage of the land.

Preliminary evidence suggests that despite the large ionic radius of Cesium, it does exchange into the small tunnels within the crystalline framework of the zeolites. This is shown by unit cell parameter changes and shifts in the Raman spectrum associated with elongation of bonds within the framework of the zeolites.

This study addresses concerns by examining summer (June-August) rainfall frequency and intensity in connection with flash floods in the Appalachian region of eastern Kentucky and West Virginia during 1995-2005. Flash floods were identified using the National Climatic Data Center's (NCDC) Storm Database. Radar estimated rainfall data from the area NWS Weather Forecast Offices were provided by NCDC. In order to examine relationships between flash flood events and rainfall amounts for both states, the latter was categorized for: 0 to 24.99 mm, 25 to 49.99 mm, 50 to 74.99 mm, 75 to 99.99 mm, 100 to 124.99 mm, 125 to 150 mm, and 150+ mm.

Approximately 15 additional SNe of various types and ages have been discovered from the dataset and added to the 42 SNe already detected. This sample is sufficient to obtain an accurate rate of SNe in the local universe. The rates are weighted by volume, total light, and host galaxy type.

This monolith has acoustic properties that differ from the original specimen in magnitude but similar in directional characteristics. This presentation will cover the measurements made of carbonized wood and make comparisons to the original wood properties. It will be shown that velocity is reduced by 34 percent in some species by carbonization, and anisotropy is retained but reduced. These properties suggest the material can be as an alternative in acoustic applications. This is a part of an ongoing study in which wood is transformed into advanced materials such as composites and ceramics.

This presentation will focus on a content analysis of four major U.S. newspapers and their conceptualization and presentation of computer hackers in the news media. The findings of this analysis suggest that the media often mislabels and negatively present hackers to the public whether or not a computer crime has been committed. Consequently, the negative stigma associated with the label of hacker is perpetuated despite academic efforts to correctly identify and label specific categories of hackers. [page 6] GRADUATE ABSTRACTS 37 Anozie, Cynthia \"Effect of High Glucose Cultured Human Endothelial Cells on the Kaolin Clotting Time\" (Dr. Emmanuel Iyiegbuniwe) Endothelial cell function may be damaged in diabetes mellitus as a result of hyperglycemia. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of high glucose-cultured endothelial cells on kaolin clotting time. Eight healthy blood donors were included in the study. EAhy 926 endothelial cells were incubated with varying physiological glucose concentrations (5.5, 11.0 and 22.0 mM RPMI 1640 glucose medium) 24 hours prior to conducting the clotting test. The results of the different clotting times showed that 6 donors had longer clotting times for physiological glucose cultured EAhy 926 endothelial cells when compared to the other experimental conditions. The results showed no significant difference between the four groups (p>0.1) tested, however, shorter clotting times were observed in the 22.0 mM cells compared to the control culture (p<0.1). Further studies with large samples are recommended to establish the effect of glucose concentration on clotting time. [page 8] Badwaik, Vivek; Dakshinamurthy, Rajalingam \"Novel Method for Recovery of Recombinant Proteins in Their Soluble Forms from E. coli\" (Dr. Rajalingam Dakshinamurthy) Escherichia coli is one of the most widely used hosts for the production of recombinant proteins. The use of bacteria as factories for recombinant expression is sometimes limited by their intrinsic tendency to accumulate the target protein into inactive insoluble aggregates, called inclusion bodies. While some proteins can be extracted and refolded from the insoluble inclusion bodies, others cannot. Therefore, there is a strong need for development of strategies to mitigate the formation of inclusion bodies during overexpression of proteins in bacterial hosts. This study will examine those specific challenges and will explore potential solutions to this problem. We aim to exploit synthetic molecular chaperones like gold to prevent the formation of inclusion bodies during over-expression of proteins in bacterial hosts.

We must foster an atmosphere that is conducive to open dialogue and discourse to broaden our collective toolkit on policy, process, and implementation methods and designs. Understanding group think and its implications on practice and application, embracing diversity and its expanding definitions within our organizations, and examining conflict and its implications for administrators in our organizations will provide a foundation for creating an atmosphere that is conducive to open discussion on policy, process, and implementation methods and designs. [page 9] Barefoot, Jeffrey Allen \"President Obama's Healthcare Proposal and the Affect on Healthcare Quality\" (Dr. William Mkanta) Healthcare quality has been addressed for decades with intensifying public debates and political posturing. The diversity of stakeholders within the healthcare industry has created a subjective view of healthcare quality based upon the unique perspective of the individual stakeholder. President Obama was elected to office promising to improve our national healthcare system and has recently proposed significant reforms. This research paper will investigate if it is possible to gain insight into the impact of healthcare quality concerning Obama's recent plan for healthcare reform. I am also interested in how the President's healthcare plan will affect quality in relation to three of the popular models for healthcare. The objective of my work is to identify the stakeholders most likely affected. Fibroblast Growth Factor\" (Drs. Rajalingam Dakshinamurthy and Eric Conte) Members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family have been associated with a variety of important functions including angiogenesis and wound repair, survival of neurons, and pathogenesis of various diseases. FGFs interact with specific FGF receptors and heparan sulfate proteoglycan on cell surfaces. Conventionally, the synthetic heparin sepharose column chromatography method was used to purify FGF, which is very efficient but has many disadvantages like long experimental time and cost and maintenance of heparin column. On the other hand, in the present study we devised an efficient off-column purification method with no disadvantages in the heparin column. In this newer purification method we used amberlite ion exchange resins having high exchange capacity, which is derived from carboxylic acid functional groups. These resins, which consist of styrene divinylbenzene or polyacrylic copolymers as macroreticular spherical beads, are easily regenerated using dilute mineral acid and can be used over wide pH ranges. These findings pave the way for purification of several other cationic Phone Use on College Students\" (Dr. Christine Nagy) Cell phone use is emerging as an addiction problem that has the potential to affect the health of university students. This study examined the relationship among sleep, depression, social interaction, dependence and cell phone use. This cross sectional prospective study involved a survey on 171 undergraduate students. Analysis showed increased dependence with high use of text messaging while driving and high use of cell phone primarily to interact with friends in the afternoon and night. Students reported feeling safe with cell phone and indicated a high self-efficacy for not using it if asked by the professor in class, if its use affected their health and if stricter university policies were employed. Analysis showed absence of peer influence on students for cell phone use. This study will help to increase our knowledge and create awareness about potential health concerns associated with cell phone use. If warranted, health programs could be developed to address these health concerns. [page 13] 38 Bhoyar, Sandhya Shamrao \"Normative Beliefs of Students Regarding H1N1\" (Drs. Christine Nagy and Steve Nagy) There has been an alarming increase of H1N1 cases globally. This cross sectional study assessed students' perceptions and awareness about H1N1 after its outbreak in May 2009 in college students (N= 503) before the administration of H1N1 vaccine on campus. Questions appraised students' knowledge of preventive methods for H1N1, influences to get immunized, barriers preventing them from vaccination and sources of information about H1N1. Results indicated that 37% believed they were at risk for H1N1, 25% intended to get vaccinated and 49% were aware of preventive methods. Few saw parents or friends (18%) as influences to get vaccinated and only 6% identified barriers that might prevent them from getting vaccinated. Students reported learning about H1N1 from sources like television (90%), friends and family (92%), the internet (81%) and teachers (78%). Results will help program planners identify communication channels and strategies to use to develop education and awareness programs to promote H1N1 Lindsey Bryan, Kendrick William \"Access to Opportunity: A Discussion of Title IX\" (Dr. Patricia Minter) Title IX refers to the Educational Amendments of 1972 and does not expressly refer to any athletic programs, but debate within the two houses of Congress indicated athletics would be impacted by the legislation. The statute prohibits gender discrimination in educational institutions that either directly or indirectly receive federal funds. Ten key areas are addressed by the law: Access to Higher Education, Athletics, Career Education, Education for Pregnant and Parenting Students, Employment, Learning Environment, Math and Science, Sexual Harassment, and Standardized Testing and Technology. While Title IX has created a sex-segregated athletics system, inequity in athletic opportunities is still commonplace.

This advancement has brought international recruitment. People work as such this world is one big organization; thus, intercultural association becomes an important competence of any organization. Leadership also needs to deal with this issue. Proper leadership skills and intercultural knowledge can bring the organizations to achieve their goals. Courses in colleges or university both undergraduate and graduate should require courses about leadership and communication skills. Students should know practice or build their leadership and communication ability which is essential in organizations. Also, those organizations or companies can provide these issues as a training program to develop their employees. [page 8] Chugh, Pooja Professions\" (Dr. Vijay Golla) Dental professionals are susceptible to a number of occupational hazards resulting in adverse health effects. These include percutaneous exposure incidents (PEI); exposure to infectious diseases (including bioaerosols), radiation, dental materials, and noise leading to musculoskeletal disorders; dermatitis, respiratory disorders, eye injuries, psychological problems, and other potential health effects. In the past, dentist and dental hygiene students used to stand at the dental chair, and were at risk of developing varicose veins, phlebitis, fallen arches, and scoliosis. Today, students are instructed to sit at the dental chair, with a potential for developing hemorrhoids, a stiff neck, scoliosis or arthritic knee joints from prolonged inactivity. This goes along with today's patient positioning in the dental clinic where dental patients are positioned almost horizontally unlike yester years where patients sat upright, and could expectorate or regurgitate easily to clear their throats. Most dentists are aware of occupational hazards at their workplace, but the level of protection against these work related injuries varies. As part of infection control protocols, dentists should continue to utilize personal protective measures and appropriate sterilization or other appropriate and effective disinfection techniques. It is recommended that regular workshops and informational seminars on occupational hazards be organized for all employees of dental clinics periodically. Such activities could enhance learning and application of preventive measures to help reduce and control occupational hazards in dental professions.

A team of senior electrical engineering students are conducting this feasibility study for WRECC. With this greater demand of power, the team will be evaluating the feasibility of a 7,200/14,400 Y to 14,400/25000 Y voltage conversion. Benefits of using 25,000 volt systems are that the systems operate at half the current and a quarter of the voltage drop compared to a 14,400 volt system. By using historical and future loading information about this area, the team will explore the feasibility of upgrading this system for a minimum of 20 years using tools such as Milsoft Wind.

This entailed discussions with different ethnic group samples to identify potential risky environmental health practices. Each focus group consisted of 6-8 members who were identified by immigrant gatekeepers. Meetings occurred at the HABG learning center during late afternoon hours; the format introduced the purpose of the focus groups and required participants to respond to a standard s e r i e s o f q u e s t i o n s p a t t e r n e d a f t e r t h e o r e t i c a l c o n s t r u c t s . W h e n necessary, English interpreters were utilized. Most groups acknowledged the role of personal responsibility in asthma care and prevention. Susceptibility and severity indicators varied considerably. Barriers to prevention largely focused on ignorance and laziness. Cleanliness beliefs were similar across groups and cues to action were misunderstood. Theoretical constructs can assist in identifying immigrant characteristics that can be utilized to develop environmental health interventions.

The emergence of Internet Web 2.0 design along with distributed GIS services allows for anyone to interact with and add to the information found on central internet sites. Historical geography often relies upon public participation from individuals outside the academic world to provide narrative descriptions, photographs and manuscripts of past places and events. PPGIS allows for visualization of the pre-park communities in new and unique ways. A PPGIS website for Mammoth Cave will create a central location for dispersed and disparate park data resources related to pre-park Mammoth Cave communities to be presented with a geographic context.

The objective is to investigate the volatile by-products from wood pyrolysis for the production of chemicals and for fuel use. We are investigating the volatile products obtained at different heating rates by GC-MS. Calorific values of the condensed vapors, collected at different conditions of flash, fast and slow pyrolysis are to be measured using a bomb calorimeter. Present results indicate that heating rates influence the apparent temperatures a particular compound is released. The information we obtain will be valued by industries such as charcoal and activated carbon producers which currently perform biomass pyrolysis by allowing them to form approaches that optimize their energy use and minimize waste.

The vineyard in front of the greenhouse is a demonstration vineyard for students and the public to learn about establishing and growing a vineyard. I conducted my research at the newest vineyard, which was established in May 2009 behind the greenhouse. I studied different types of weed control under the grape vines and the effects of treatment on the growth of the plants. The four weed control treatments are no treatment, sprayed with Roundup, tilled with a rotary tiller, and mowed.

Cathleen Webb and Eric Conte) Zirconium (IV) oxide or ZrO2 sometimes known as zirconia, is a metal oxide with a very unique surface chemistry. In this research, the complex chemistry of zirconia surface is examined. Strong hard Lewis acid sites present on a zirconia surface can interact with hard Lewis base sites resulting in interactions that have been successfully exploited in the separation of proteins. The physical and chemical properties of zirconia from a chromatographic point of view are described. The dependence of the surface area, pore size, and pore volume on thermal treatment is also emphasized. The absorption capability of ATP by zirconia was studied with some initial spectra characterization. In a further research, zirconia is exploited for the separations of ATP, AMP and ADP. Adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) one of the nucleotides, will be adsorbed to the surface of the porous zirconia. The immobilization efficiency onto the porous zirconia material will be evaluated in terms of the amount of protein attached to the compound and from the biological activity remaining after the immobilization step. The effects of pH and buffer concentration will also be presented. The results will be compared with a similar experiment with porous silica of similar material. The aim is to see how well zirconia can be substituted with silica in protein separations. [page 13] 40 Graves, Melinda \" D o p p l e r-broadening of Light Nuclei Gamma-ray Spectra\" (Drs.

After the first session, participants were prompted to develop strategies for improving their two mile time in the second session scheduled for one week later. Strategies included things done both immediately before and during the next exercise session. Males completed the two miles significantly faster than females in both exercise sessions. Males also had significantly higher rates of perceived exertion than females during the second session, in other words, males worked significantly harder to improve their times.

We examined a pervious cement reactive barrier system (PCRB) in which the modifier is incorporated directly into the matrix pervious cement barrier. As the groundwater flows through the barrier, contaminants will be trapped and/or modified, thereby reducing the contaminant plume and the necessity for further treatment. Such a system will require little or no active maintenance; furthermore, characterization of contaminants at the site would allow the PCRB to be \"tailored\" to specific characteristics.

Benevolent sexism encompasses subjectively positive (for the sexist) attitudes toward women in traditional roles: protective paternalism, idealization of women, and desire for intimate relations. Hostile sexism, however, encompasses the negative equivalents on each dimension: dominative paternalism, derogatory beliefs, and heterosexual hostility. Previous research has found that exposure to sexism, especially of the benevolent variety, can result in reduced performance outcomes for women. Most studies to date which have assessed the impact of benevolent vs. hostile sexism on women's performance have done so in the context of more egalitarian western society. The present study seeks to contribute to this cultural gap in the literature by examining the impact of benevolent and hostile sexism on performance for women in four textile factories in Turkey.

To identify genes or sites required for anti-termination in the right operon of HK639, a suppressor tRNA gene (tRNAgly) is inserted at different locations by the recombineering technique. The effect of the insertions was qualitatively monitored by assaying phage release. into HK639 M3 gene prevented phage release suggesting that M3 gene is essential for phage production. To quantitate tRNAgly production from the fusions we plan to monitor the expression of a luciferase reporter plasmid that carries a lux gene amber mutation.

Being white, single and living away from campus were risk factors. Females who practiced regular religious services identified their risk at 5% compared to those females who do not practice religious services at almost double the risk (9.4%). 10.7% of males and 17.6% of females reported being stalked or receiving unwanted attention. Only 6% of respondents thought that abuse was a concern for college students. Literature shows that victimization is underreported. Implications are that personalized approaches must be developed for sexual violence risk reduction among students.

Pretest questionnaires from 2,147 adolescents aged from 12 to 18 year of age who participated in WAIT training were analyzed. The findings show that measures of teen knowledge, beliefs, and confidence about abstinence and sexual activity differed significantly by gender, race, age, and school type. Overall, males had more knowledge and were more pragmatic about teens being sexually active and the challenges of being abstinent. Females had stronger beliefs about negative outcomes of sex and positive benefits of abstinence and were more confident about being abstinent. The poster will describe these and other student differences.

Analysis showed 90% of full time students aged 18to 27 years from public institution were international students. Students researched about WKU and the U.S. culture through internet (98%), WKU website and from student organizations before enrolling at WKU. International students interacted more than twice as much with their faculty in their country than in U.S. Communication with home- country faculty was done face-to-face (100%), while at WKU, students preferred email followed by face-to-face (95%) and phone calls (52%). As teaching method being different in their country and English not being the primary language, international students reported stress. Thus these findings show that the difference in cultural variation increased stress in international students and affected student teacher interaction, thereby affecting their learning and hindering effective teaching.

Bivariate measures using best fit around the 50th percentile were used for comparisons conducted on the independent measure of high and low perceived stress and the dependent measures. Findings from the five different cross-sectional cohorts show consistencies across years: emotional indicators of sadness and hopelessness along with negative coping strategies such as smoking, alcohol abuse and bulimia are consistently and significantly associated with high perception of stress. Prevention programs for substance use and mental health must incorporate stress management strategies to offset issues related to coping and mood among adolescent populations. [page and Nagy, Steve \" M e d i t a t i o n a s S t r e s s Management in Graduate Public Health Students\" (Drs.

A pretest duplicating items on the midterm and final exam was administered to all students at the first class meeting. Identical midterm and final exams were administered in both classes. During the first half of the semester, each class session in one section was preceded by a ten minute deep breathing stress management procedure (n = 29). During the second half of the semester this procedure was discontinued in the first section and implemented in the other section (n = 9). There were no significant differences by age, citizenship, or gender between the two sections of the course. Students in both classes showed significant gains in knowledge, the stress management intervention showed no significant impact on gains. [page 13] Mandale, Pankaj Anandrao and Shearer, Darlene \"Faculty Insights and Experiences with Academic Dishonesty of Students\" (Dr. Darlene Shearer) This descriptive study examined experiences and perceptions of faculty regarding cheating and plagiarism.

Nearly 80 % of responders agreed that plagiarism is a big problem; 81% said they had caught students cheating in their classroom; and nearly 90% said it is easy to spot plagiarized work. More than half believed students who cheat do so numerous times. However, contrary to one of the study hypotheses, only 22% of faculty believed that international students commonly cheat. Nearly half think that U.S. students cheat as much or more than international students. The presentation will discuss other faculty beliefs about academic honesty, its causes and how these beliefs influence the actions they take with students when academic dishonesty occurs and solutions to eliminate it from the WKU campus. [page 13] Mandale, Pankaj Anandrao and Shearer, Darlene \"Study on University Student Attitudes, Beliefs and Perceptions Related to Academic Dishonesty\" (Dr. Darlene Shearer) This descriptive study examined attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions of 140 international students at WKU. The findings showed that nearly half of the students reported little or no prior knowledge of plagiarism and 45% indicated that plagiarism is not an important concern in their country of origin. In spite of receiving advice from friends (40%) and warnings from professors (66%), 28% of responders said they had cheated or plagiarized at least once while at WKU. Another 6% reported engaging in these practices numerous times. Nearly 34% said they believe academic dishonesty is common among international student classmates while 44% felt that U.S. students also plagiarize.

Carroll Cave, Missouri is a fluvio-karst system with biological and speleological significance. Initial delineation of a recharge area for Carroll Cave indicates an area of 15 km2. Thunder River, in Carroll Cave, was traced to 8 springs at Toronto Springs, a multi-spring system. Five springs appear to have sources independent of Carroll Cave. From geochemical properties of each spring, water chemistry differences between the outlets are evident. Dataloggers, water analysis of ion and bicarbonate are defining variations in water chemistry. By dye tracing and creating geochemical signatures for individual springs, source waters for Toronto Springs are being identified.

Chelation with the amide nitrogen is possible for many platinum (II)diamine complexes with peptides. Previously, we have found that the presence of bulk on the amine ligands can alter the stoichiometry and/or coordination preferences in the reactions of platinum complexes with methionine and N-acetylmethioine. Here, we have investigated the reactions of several platinum(II)complexes with two model peptides, FMRF and ACTH (1-10)(sequence SYSMEHFRWG), both of which contain an internal methionine residue. The platinum complexes differ in leaving groups and amount of amine ligand bulk. HPLC with a cation-exchange column has been used to monitor the rates of reaction and to determine the number of products. [page Accounting Management: A Key Factor for a Successful Lean Organization Management\" (Dr. Mark Doggett) Over the past years, lean, just-in-time or quality management concepts have been employed in various industries to emphasize waste elimination, one-piece flow in all processes and continuous improvement. Their application has illustrated significant positive change. Accounting, however, has largely been isolated in lean transformation. Therefore, there is an increasing need to streamline and simplify accounting systems for easy understanding by all the parties (executives, employers, and shareholders). This presentation examines elements that should be eliminated from the traditional accounting systems in order to easier provide time-based products. The presentation will also suggest tools that would facilitate implementation of the simplified approaches and their continuous improvement. [page 8] Nutakki, Gopi Chand vs. Orientation Histogram\" (Dr. Qi Li) Descriptors of image features are expected to be robust with respect to varied imaging conditions, including scale, orientation, etc. Appearances and orientation histograms (such as SIFT) are two popularly used descriptors in image matching applications, such as stereo correspondence, object recognition. In the context of scale and orientation invariant matching, appearance will be normalized to the standard size and orientation. In this research, we present a comparison study of these two kinds of descriptors of key points on stereo correspondence.

The Karst Disturbance Index (KDI) is a holistic tool used to measure anthropogenic impacts on karst environments. The purpose of this research was to create a KDI score for Arecibo, Puerto Rico and to refine the indicators and scoring to best utilize the KDI for karst management in an island karst setting. Application of the KDI will educate the public and help to foster stewardship of the karst resources in Puerto Rico. Preliminary results indicate a prevalence of disturbance ranging from urbanization to agriculture, with additional research needed to identify further disturbances and mitigation recommendations. [page 12] 44 Porter, P. Elliott \"Human Factors Analysis in Naval Aviation\" (Dr. Mark Doggett) Human error is an ongoing problem in the aviation industry. Figures show these errors are blamed for up to 80% of aviation mishaps. Of these, the term \"operator error\" is listed up to 60% of the time. Determining the human factors involved in aviation mishaps through root cause analysis (RCA) is a valuable key in preventing future mishaps. The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) developed by Drs. Scott A. Shappell and Douglas A. Wiegmann has become the method of choice in the Department of Defense (DOD). In 2009, the Navy institutionalized this system into aviation mishap investigation. This presentation will show how the system works as an RCA tool in Naval aviation mishap investigation, its benefits in mishap prevention, and the utility of the system in other industries.

M i c h a e l A n n Williams) Western Kentucky University has a rich history of folklore scholarship, dating back to at least the early 20th century and Gordon Wilson. Folklore archives across the nation have long been repositories for the fieldwork of folklorists, and a place to look to supplement future studies. Western Kentucky's Folklife Archives are no exception, housing thousands of impressive pieces donated from many generations of folklore scholars. Yet very little has been written about the Western Kentucky Folklife Archives Through oral history and primary documentation, my paper attempts to capture a brief history of the Folklife Archives from the earliest days of Gordon Wilson, D. K. Wilgus, and Lynwood Montell to the present day. [page 14] Quintanar, Arturo of Energy Fluxes and Evaporation from a Waste Lagoon to Different Stability Model Formulations\" (Dr. Rezaul Mahmood) Emissions from agricultural and animal operations directly impact the quality of life and health of people that live and work in proximity to these sources of pollution. One known source of malodorous gases and particulate matter are anaerobic lagoons which are widely used in the United States to collect, treat and store effluents from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOS). The present research is part of an ongoing air quality research program whose general goal is to establish phenomenological relationships between emissions from anaerobic waste lagoons and the meteorological and atmospheric stability conditions that control it. As a first step towards that, it is proposed to test the sensitivity of evaporation and sensible heat fluxes estimates from three methodologies.

In national samples of undergraduates and graduates compiled over the last decade, Thoma and Bebeau cited increases in personal interests moral reasoning (i.e., the least developmental advancement) and decreases in postconventional moral reasoning (i.e., the most developmental advancement). Thoma and Bebeau suggested that certain broad-based social trends occurring over the last decade may be responsible for these changes. Such trends include increases in narcissism and use of electronic media and communication devices (i.e., social networking websites, cellular phones, and iPODs). These trends may have translated to increased self presentation and self isolation. If so, moral judgment developmental changes are sensible. Thus, the current study investigated the degree to which moral judgment development is linked to narcissism and the use of and attitudes toward electronic media and communication devices. Results support that these variables are linked. [page 13] Sadhnani, Mahesh Hiralal \"Erroneous Perception of Body Size and Suicide Contemplation among Adolescents\" (Drs. Cecilia Watkins and Marilyn Gardner) Suicide is the third leading cause of death among young people ages 15 to 24. Suicide or an attempt to commit suicide is often preceded by stressful events in one's life. Ridicule from peers can be such a stressful event and can precipitate suicide ideation among adolescents. There has been a growing trend of cultural bias against obese and overweight individuals. This stigmatization has lead to children being increasingly conscious of their weight. Data from the National 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) were analyzed to explore the relationship between suicidal ideation and suicide gestures/attempts and the perception of body size among youth who accurately and inaccurately identified their BMI status. Results from this study, as well as the public health implications, will be discussed. \"The Unfathomable, the Unforgivable, the Unpardonable: How the Literature of Hawthorne Heightens the Guilt of Shameful Sin\" (Dr. Sandra Hughes) An unpardonable sin is a sin so serious, forgiveness is beyond the reach of God's grace. The theme of Unpardonable Sin has resonated throughout many works written by Nathaniel Hawthorne. As a man whose ancestors took part in a chapter of 45 America's shameful history, Hawthorne uses the idea of heavy guilt that burdens his protagonists. Their own selfish, immoral choices or thoughts cause many events to unfold that leave the character (and others) in misery and/or disgrace, far from being saved by the mercy of God. This essay demonstrates the aforementioned issue, using two of Hawthorne's most conflicted and corrupt creations: Reuben Borne from Roger Malvin's Burial a nd Aylmer from The Birth-mark. The selfish actions of these literary characters are prime examples of Hawthorne's fixation of unpardonable sin. of Hatchery vs. Wild Largemouth Bass\" (Dr. Steve Huskey) Fishes are highly phenotypically plastic. So, aquacultured fish may vary significantly from their wild counterparts which can adversely affect their survival after release. This study tries to determine if oral and pharyngeal jaw dentition differed between hatchery and wild bass. Scanning electron micrographs of the jaws were compared for the number and characteristics of teeth. Wild bass feed on live elusive prey using their villiform oral jaw teeth to secure prey trapped between the jaws during capture. In contrast, hatchery reared fish maintained on pelleted food suggest, their oral jaw might develop differently (fewer and reduced size) than their wild counterparts. This difference could have a s i g n i f i c a n t e f f e c t o n p r e y-capture efficiency when introduced into the wild. [page 16] (Dr. Ferhan Atici) Statistics from the American Cancer Society (ACS) show that breast cancer is the leading cancer type in women under 65. Accordingly, mathematical modeling become an integral part of immunological research. Almost in every theory of mathematics there exists its discrete counterpart which makes the theory easier to understand and easier to use in modeling process of the real world problems. Since the fractional derivative of a function depends on its whole time history, and not on its instantaneous behavior, they are perfectly suited for the tumor growth. In this talk, some basics of discrete fractional calculus will be developed. We use simplest discrete fractional calculus of variations problem and derive Euler-Lagrange equation. We introduce and solve Gompertz fractional difference equation for tumor growth models. Heather See Batra, Sumit Care Services among HIV-Infected Persons\" (Dr. William Mkanta) Racial and ethnic disparities found in access to health care are well discussed among HIV/AIDS infected adults & its prevalence is complex. It has been observed that access-related factors like insurance status, income level, cultural & spiritual belief & varied health systems contribute for lower access of health services utilization in minorities. Despite efforts at various levels of the government to address this problem, there is still a significant number of HIV/AIDS infected population experiencing the inequity, with reports from nationally representative studies showing that HIV-infected individuals belonging to minority populations have not been able to obtain some needed health care services. The purpose of presentation is to examine types of differences still reported regarding health services received by HIV-infected individuals. [page of the compounds responsible for malodours in food, animal production and waste. Clostridium scatalogenes is the most studied strain for the production of 3- MI. If, the factors that down regulate the production of 3-MI are known, additives may be used that can minimize the 3-MI production. To understand and elucidate the pathway for 3-MI production, we need a genetic modification system in Cl. scatalogenes. This system will allow generation of mutants defective in or regulation of 3-MI synthesis. Phages are useful tools within bacterial genetic systems. Currently a phage capable of infecting Cl. scatalogenes h a s not been identified. Upon isolation of phage, Cl. scatalogenes w i l l b e s c r e e n e d f o r 3- M I production. We tested 18 environmental samples for a phage that could infect Cl. scatalogenes. Prophage induction using Mitomycin-C did not yield any phage. Plaque assays and TEM also failed to indicate the presence of a phage.

The campers completed the measures upon arriving at camp and on the last day of camp. Findings suggest non-significant changes from baseline to post-treatment with respect to campers' however, post-hoc analyses revealed that, at post-treatment, male participants had higher mean scores on peer comparison (p = .022) and significantly lower means on the measure of self-efficacy (p = .006) than their female counterparts. Findings suggest that specialized summer camps may have a more positive effect on the male campers' perceived self-efficacy than females' (Dr. Mark Doggett) Courses in photography design introduce the theory of photography, develop potential skills, and give realistic practices to increase the experiences. The involutes will use the basic skills of photography combined with their academic and program scholar to finish their works. A generic photography design course will be the foundational class; we focus on the people who are interested in photography and link up with current industry. Students will understand the development model used in academic 46 knowledge and in industry to completely restructure its generic photography design foundation course to reflect industry requirements.

The sound production capabilities and characteristics of the family Loricariidae have not been well studied. Sounds produced by two loricariid catfish species, Otocinculus affinis and Pterygoplichthys gibbiceps were recorded. Light and scanning electron microscopy were used to examine the pectoral spines from the largest and smallest fish from both species. Relationships between spine inter-ridge distance, pulse duration, and frequency will be discussed. [page 15] West, Cassie See Aldridge, Jessica R.

[page 15] Wright, Alice Ann and King, Rodney \"Sequence of Bacteriophage HK239 and Comparative Genomic Analysis\" (Dr. Rodney King) Genes expressed from prophages have a variety of functions, including virulence and exclusion. We are interested in bacteriophage HK239 because it can exclude a wide range of phage including P2, P1vir, Lambda, HK022, T4rII, and &#966;80. In previous work, a clone that excluded HK022 was identified as a &#966;80 cor homolog. None of the screened clones excluded P2 or Lambda which suggests that multiple genes control superinfection exclusion in HK239 lysogens. To identify other candidate exclusion gene(s) and to further characterize the phage, we have sequenced and annotated the HK239 genome. We have compared the genome to other lambdoid phages and, as is common in this family, there is evidence of genetic mosaicism. No additional exclusion homologs have been identified. However, based on the genomic location of known exclusion genes in other phage, several candidate genes in HK239 have been identified as potentially encoding "}
