To be perfectly honest, I have! There have been times that I have looked up in total frustration, as if to say, \"Could ya just give me a clue?\" Other times, I can be found more gently pleading, \"Oh come on... just give me a little sign! Help me to understand what I already know!\" If you're wondering if there actually is a way to harness the energy of \"wanting to know,\" the answer is YES\u2014 and it's called [Spiritual Kinesiology](https://swiha.edu/class/hy-520/)! This practice is a form of muscle testing that will allow you to pretty clearly know what you believe deep within. It involves your right index finger-your pointer finger-which [I refer to as the \"god finger.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tbk5DGrdEP0&feature=youtu.be) It is called the \"god finger\" because when we come to a crossroads where we really need to have clarity about something, many of us pray to God and look for divine signs of guidance and confirmation. Your index finger could just as easily be called the \"divine finger\" or the \"finger of knowing.\" Kinesiology is not a new \"woo-woo \"idea; it's based on the work of [Dr. George Goodheart](https://www.icak.com/index.php/what-is-the-icak/icak-history/52-george-j-goodheart-jr-founder), a chiropractor who developed Applied Kinesiology in the 1960s by establishing a direct relationship between responses to different muscle movements and the functions of the body. It has since been used for detecting and correcting various imbalances which may relate to stress, injuries, nutrition, and emotional uncertainty. Kinesiology relies on our ability to access information from the unconscious mind and the body's innate intelligence. We often hear it said, \"We have the answers within.\" By using muscle testing or finger strength, we can confirm our intuition or inner-knowing. Over time, the use of [kinesiology](http://www.americankinesiology.org/about-us/about-us/about-aka) has expanded into virtually all levels of healing. The key to receiving accurate information is simply through training your \"god finger!\" How to train your \"god finger\" Point your right index finger straight at the heavens and make a definitive statement that can only be answered with YES or NO. With your left index finger, apply firm pressure to your right finger. If the right finger stays strong, the answer to the question is YES! If your right finger becomes weak or bows down as if in submission, the answer is NO. Try this: Holding your right index finger up, take a deep breath, and say, \"I am a good person!\" Using your left index finger, apply pressure to your right finger, fully expecting a transparent answer. Your finger will stay strong if you do believe on the deepest level that you are a good person. Your finger will bow or waiver if feelings or thoughts of self-doubt are taking up space in your mind. To refine your \"god finger,\" follow these steps: Step 1: Seek to understand what your finger feels like when it is communicating YES and the difference you experience when the internal message is NO! One of the best ways to understand your finger's YES is to state your preferred personal name as a starting point. Hold your finger up and say, \"My name is _________!\" With your left finger, apply pressure, testing the truth of your declaration. Unless there is something you do not prefer about your name, your finger will give you a strong YES. To confirm your YES, lift your finger to heaven and say, \"My name is Red Fox [or any name that isn't yours]!\" Knowing the answer is no, your finger will show a weak response, or bow down. It is communicating NO! Step 2: Practice simple affirmative statements as a way of training your finger to know YES and NO. Once you have confidence in the way your index finger responds, you can begin asking more important questions. Remember that [the body is an instrument for communication](//www.blog.swiha.edu/kaye-bahr-learning-to-let-go-of-attachment-through-mind-body-wellness), and as long as the definition of YES and NO is clear in your mind, the answers you get will be consistent. Step 3: Do not force the answers you seek. There may be times only partial clarity will come; your finger won't feel strong, yet it doesn't bow down with a clear NO either. The clarity you desire is either something you are not ready to know, or it's not time for you to know. Simply put, the divine timing has not arrived. Resist the temptation to overpower the hesitant answer, and allow the answer to be revealed at a later time. You can also get inconclusive results with spiritual kinesiology when you are tired, under the influence of a toxin or mind-altering substance, or you are unable to be present in the moment. If your results are inconsistent, try drinking water; if this doesn't help, stop and try it again when you are more clear-headed and energetically prepared to receive answers. Step 4: Be unattached to the results. Spiritual kinesiology is dependent on getting out of your own way. This means doing the self-muscle testing [without attachment to the outcome](//www.blog.swiha.edu/life-coaching-corner-non-attachment-sucks) and allowing only your deep knowing to be revealed. One of the greatest blocks to accuracy in this technique is being invested in getting a particular answer. Your \"god finger\" can give you information that you don't have at the conscious level. As you learn to keep an open mind, you can access your inner knowing as long as it is not overpowered by your attachment to what you want the answer to be. Step 5: Be specific to receive accurate divine confirmation. Clearly state the affirmations you are testing in present tense rather than as a question. The more clearly stated the test statement is, the clearer the answers you will receive. Consider the difference in these two examples: - I am ready to be a Life Coach! - Should I be a Life Coach? While you could ascertain a YES or NO from both sentences, asking a question leaves room for more questioning. Making an affirmative statement allows for clearer, more affinitive answers. Consider another example: - Should I call Charlie? - I am ready to call Charlie! While you may believe you should call Charlie because of a whole variety of reasons, we need to be aware of the past programming about \"should's\" and \"shouldn'ts\" which may lend to internal conflict with your desires and your true readiness to move forward. Rather than asking questions, train your \"god finger\" to respond to strong affirmative statements. As a person of integrity, true to your word, your internal knowing will respond to the truth of your statements. Step 6: Seek to have the beliefs revealed. Using spiritual kinesiology is a good way to determine the hidden beliefs and perceptions that may be in conflict with what we consciously say we want to attract into our life. By identifying the thoughts and beliefs holding us back from manifesting what want to create in the world, we can make new conscious decisions and move forward. Our \"I am\" beliefs play a significant role in what shows up in our real-life experience. Muscle test these \"I am\" statements using your \"god-finger\" and see what shows up! - I am ready [to create a powerful private practice](//www.blog.swiha.edu/dare-to-dream/-0)! - I am willing to [serve in the loving and prosperous way](//www.blog.swiha.edu/life-coaching-corner-are-you-brave-enough-to-be-an-entrepreneur)in the world! - I am deserving of health and prosperity! According to [A Course in Miracles](https://www.circleofa.org/library/articles/sixteen-point-summary/), anything contradictory the idea that we are divinely whole, loving, and perfect as we were created may be\u2014as we teach at SWIHA\u2014 [\"something to coach around.\"](https://swiha.edu/class/bc-560-p/) Training your \"god finger\" to be a reliable spiritual guidance tool will serve to empower you as you seek to serve in the world in a loving and "}
