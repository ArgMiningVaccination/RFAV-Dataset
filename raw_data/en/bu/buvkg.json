Designed specifically for the CPS social worker, the IPOM provides hands -on, step -by-step procedures for g iving children the immediate attention they need for their safety and protection, followed by long -range planning for their permanency and well - being. Please note that in recognition that a child's biological parent is not necessarily the child's caregive r, this IPOM uses the term \"caregiver\" to reference the types of parental relationships that are cited in D.C. Official Code : parent, guardian, or custodian ; and may also use those terms . AGENCY MISSION The DC Child and Family Services Agency works to i mprove the safety, permanence, and well -being of abused and neglected children in the District of Columbia and to strengthen their families .Please note : CFSA is involved in child maltreatment that occurs in the District of Columbia for all children no matt er where they reside and may be involved with District children maltreated outside of the District, but who reside within the District. This IPOM is a living document that fully supports th is stated mission. The role of the CPS social worker that helps to fulfill this mission cannot be underestimated! Safety - All children have a right to be safe from abu se and neglect. Permanency - All children need a permanent family who can provide an unconditional, lasting commitment to them. Child and family well -being - Children deserve to grow up in nurturing environments where their physical, emotional, education al, and social needs are met. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 6 CPS GUIDING PRINCIPLES In addition to supporting CFSA 's stated mission, the IPOM also reinforces the guiding principles of the CPS Administration: Quality & Competence Excellence Accounta bility Efficiency Timeliness Quality & Competence - High quality investigations, including safety and risk assessments, are essential for the protection of children, youth, and families. When a high quality investigation is completed, the Agency's clients are ensured the protection and safety they deserve. Excellence - Excellence in service delivery is a continuous process and involves critical thinking, non - judgmental communication, professional interpersonal interviewing, adherence to policy and proce dure, and the use of best practices. Accountability - Sound decision -making based on policy and procedures helps to ensure accountability. Accountability is also accomplished through comprehensive assessments informed by the gathering of pertinent facts and details. Accurate and concise documentation of our decisions and the information that supports them prove our efforts. Efficiency - Through use of the Agency's state -of-the-art automated child welfare information system, known as FACES.NET , you are able to increase the efficiency of services to clients as well as increasing the Agency's ability to track placement and permanency data . Timeliness - Children in need of protection also need rapid intervention to secure their safety. The timeliness and accuracy of your response, along with policy compliance , will ensure the best safety intervention process possible. Equally important is timeliness in the documentation of the investigation notes. Details should be documented as soon as possible (and within 24 hours) after you have gathered the information . Concerns that need to be raised to a supervisory level should never be delayed. This includes making calls from the field , as needed , to support your work and decision -making. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 7 As a gatekeeper for t he children and families entering the child welfare system, you are bound by the above guiding principles whenever you are investigating reports of alleged maltreatment, or child abuse and neglect. In partnership with your management team , the CPS I POM will support your ability to respond to allegations of child abuse and/or neglect. It wa s specifically desig ned to function as a living document , and to evolve alongside the changing needs of the District's child welfare population . Accordingly, the IPOM will automatically serve as a vehicle for implemen ting new evidence -informed child welfare practices while simultaneously incorporating current policy and procedures, and relevant federal and District CPS requirements. \"Practice Points\" are included in the Guide to further support your activities in key subject matters . FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 8 OVERVIEW OF THE CPS ADMINISTRATION FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 9 The CPS administration is comprised of four divisions staffed by a program administrator, program managers, supervisors, social workers , and family support workers . Although the divisions are not specifically divided by investigation type, there are specialized units (e.g., sexual abuse and institutional abuse) that serve the entire administration. CPS ROLES AND RESPON SIBILITIES The more yo u understand of the individual roles and responsibilities for each member of the CPS team , the more effective and stream -lined your communication will be and the more successful your outcomes for child safety. Remember : the CPS teaming process is a built -in structure and support network for workers and managers to perform their assigned roles and duties. Program Administrator In support of CFSA's teaming principles and best practice standards , the CPS administrator is a hands - on leader who is available fo r consultation, feedback, and direction. In addition to providing strong leadership and oversight for all CPS field operations , the administrator e stablish es the core vision, goals, objectives, short and long -range plans , and any CPS administration project s designed to enhance the Agency's child protection outcomes . The administrator is further responsible for developing and interpreting both operati onal and program policies along with specific procedures. Although the CPS administrator ultimately reports d irectly to the Deputy Director of Program Operation s, there is consistent and ongoing communication with other internal and external stakeholders to ensure the integrity of the CPS administration, specifically for CPS performance outcomes, future developme nts, evaluative procedures, and cutting -edge strategies for the protection of children, youth, and families. Program Managers The CPS program manager is experience d in assessment and evaluation, communication and negotiation, performance management, staff development and training, as well as the ability to provide day -to-day oversight of CPS units that provide direct and indirect services to and for children and families. In addition to providing assistance to the CPS administrator as needed, a program manager's responsibilities may include [but are definitely not limited to] handling information related to child fatalities, responding to or approving referrals when a worker is unable to contact a supervisor, as well as functioning as a liaison between CPS and both internal and external stakeholders. Supervisory Social Workers The CPS supervisor is responsible for supervising the full range of direct social work services provided by his or her team of social workers. The importance of the supervisory role i n consulting and overseeing child safety decision -making is as important as the actual practice occurring among CPS workers in the field. CPS supervisors must make every effort to ensure that the safety and well -being of children and families is secured th rough the delivery of professional, high quality, competent, and timely services. The following functions are expected of CPS supervisors as part of their supervisory responsibilities: Set clear expectations for staff and assist with their professional dev elopment . Coach, support, and r ole model exemplary practice standards. Inform workers o f any practice or policy changes , and give guidance as needed . Be available for supervisions and consultation as needed. Create a climate of teaming, and address the nee ds of staff to maintain the teaming environment. Model behaviors that are consistent with CFSA's mission and the National Association of Social Workers' (NASW) code of ethics. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 10 CPS Social Workers Child protection is the most challenging area of child welf are. As the CPS social worker, you are responsible for the referrals assigned to you, including field investigations and provision of services. You are required to determine if the report of suspected child abuse or maltreatment is substantiated and requir es further action, and if so, what action is necessary. In addition, you are required to continue to assess the risk of further abuse and maltreatment of the child in the requisite time period noted in the DC Official Code. Family Support Workers (FSW) The main goal of the family support worker is to assist CPS in ensuring the safety and minimize risk to any child with a suspicion of abuse and neglect by their caregiver . The FSW will assist in task s across the administration that include , but are not limi ted to , independent visits to ensure child safety, assistance in emergency and planned removals of children from their homes into safe and secure environments , and obtaining and assessing information that will assist in the determination of referrals alleg ing abuse and or neglect. Given the close contact and sensitive nature of CPS in general, it is important that the FSW have a clear understanding of child welfare practices, child development, and t he helping relationship. The FSW is a valued member of t he CPS team , perform ing casework under the supervision of a supervisory social worker. The FSW also provides a wide range of support and services for complicated cases , including but not limited to one or more of the following key supports to CPS social wo rkers: Placement of children into foster care Medical screenings of children in preparation for placement into foster care Supervision of visits Interviews of supporting persons to assist in the completion of an investigation Referrals for services as need ed during each referral TYPES OF UNITS CPS is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Accordingly, CPS employees are considered \" essential \" in accordance with District regulations for emergency government closures . Under its current structure, CPS has six types of units to address the various allegations reported to the Hotline. Resource needs of the CPS administration, however, may sometimes require any given CPS social worker to handle an investigation that falls outside of the social worker's particular u nit. Therefore, every CPS social worker should be well versed in all aspects of child maltreatment and be able to complete all types of investigations. Family Assessment Units When the information provided in a Hotline call does not raise any safety conc erns for a child, yet the family situation still raises concerns, a Family Assessment (FA) social worker conducts a family assessment. The social worker's goal is to ensure the safety, well -being, and stability of the child while helping parents resolve is sues without having a traditional CPS investigation. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 11 Reports that include one or more of the following allegations may qualify for the FA pathway : Caregiver unwilling or unable to care for a youth age 13 years or older and the parent has not been ar rested. (Note: If the child is under age 13 years, this allegation result s in an investigation.) Inadequate food Inadequate physical care Inadequate or dangerous shelter Educational neglect Inadequate clothing Newborn with positive toxico logy (marijuana only) Traditional Units Traditional CPS units investigate the majority of neglect allegations. Depending upon the severity of the allegation, physical abuse allegations are also investigated in traditional units. Special Abuse Unit This unit investigates allegations of serious physical abuse of younger children, sexual abuse of children of all ages, and child fatalities. Institutional Unit The Institutional U nit investigates allegations of abuse or neglect reported to have taken place in foster homes, group homes, congregate care facilities, residential hospital facilities, boarding schools, licensed daycare facilities or homes, and juvenile detention facilities (including the District's Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services' New B eginnings Facility which, although located in Laurel, Maryland, is a District -run and District -owned facility) . This unit also assists with sexual abuse investigations , as needed. Note: CFSA does not investigate assaults by staff members in schools , such as DC Public Schools (DCPS) or charter schools , unless the staff members are acting in loco parentis (i.e., staff are acting in place of a parent for a child or youth enrolled in a residential school) . Concerns related to assaults that occur in schools may come through the CPS Hotline but these are forwarded to the District's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) for investigation as assaults . Please refer t o the CPS Hotline Procedural Operations Manual (HPOM) for referral standards . Mid-day Unit This un it works a \"swing shift\" between normal business working hours and the after hours' tour of duty. After Hours Units As noted, CPS is staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The after hours ' shifts are comprised of evening and midnight shifts that rotate the staff's assigned days of the week , includ ing weekends. These units primarily address emergency situations but also assist the overall needs of the administration by maintaining workloads, as needed, and by completing requests for assistance fr om other shifts. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 12 UNDERSTANDING LEGAL SUPPORT TO CFSA and CPS Legal support to CPS is essential in order for the Administration to carry out its work; however, t he attorneys are not part of the CPS Administration . It is important for you to know their roles an d how they support CPS as well as their role in supporting the larger Agency. There are two distinct groups of attorneys who work with CFSA. One group is officially known as the Office of the Attorney General, Family Services Division Child Protection Se ction and they are the attorneys who succinctly put, represent CFSA in court. Throughout the IPOM, we will refer to these attorneys as OAG -CPS. The other group officially known as the Office of the Attorney General, Child and Family Services Agency, Offi ce of the General Counsel, and they are the attorneys who work, amongst other things closely with the Director as well as on civil litigation, policy, confidentiality, ethics, legal sufficiency reviews, records requests, fair hearings and LaShawn matters. Throughout the IPOM we will refer to these attorneys as OAG -OGC . Please see your supervisor with any questions concerning the distinction between these two groups. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 13 ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURES FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 14 TYPES OF ASSIGNMENTS Investigations The b ulk of CPS' work involves investigations. These are referrals accepted at the CPS Hotline that involve allegations of neglect, physical abuse, sexual abuse, or that involve the fatality of a child. Safety Checks Safety checks are documented in FACES.NET as Information and Referral (I&R) matters. A safety check may be done if the call to the hotline does not rise to the level of suspected or known abuse or neglect. For the purposes of a CPS investigator, these matters do not fully meet the criteria for a C PS investigation but warrant some level of assessment or follow -up by CPS personnel. These matters are reviewed by CPS management prior to assignment to a social worker. Given the individual nature of these assignments, the supervisor and social worker w ill collaborate on the needed steps to address the concerns in the safety check . Prior to closure of a safety check, the program manager will review the I&R for completeness in terms of addressing the Agency's mission of safety, permanence, and well -being for the family. The safety check that is carried out by the agency varies based on the need(s) identified by the caller. The following types of safety checks are not all inclusive but are reflective of useful activities : Courtesy visits These are requ ests from other jurisdictions to assist with an investigation or a family well - being assessment being conducted in their jurisdiction. Safety visits These are matters where there is concern for child safety, permanence, or well -being but the concern does n ot rise to the level of a CPS investigation. Service referrals Sometimes all a family needs to stabilize is a helpful service, e.g., assistance with utility payments or parenting education. Other duties as assigned All CPS personnel are expected to appr oach their assignments and the duties of the administration with flexibility and an attitude of teamwork. Given the needs of the families we serve, staff may need to assist with answering the CPS Hotline or with tasks typically assigned to FSWs. INVESTIG ATION RESPONSE TIMES Timely initiation of investigations is required for determin ing children's safety. It is mandatory for all CPS investigations to be initiated as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after the receipt of the report. Immediate R esponse An \"immediate response\" is required when a report of suspected abuse or neglect indicates that the child's health or safety is in immediate danger , i.e., there is present danger to the child that qualifies as an emergency and that requires an immed iate response. This response must occur within 2 hours of the Hotline receiving the report. An \"immediate response\" is also required upon referral for an investigation following a family assessment indicating a child's safety or health is in immediate dan ger. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 15 24-hour Response A \"24-hour response time \" is assigned to a report when there is no immediate danger or imminent risk of abuse or neglect. Members of the CPS management team may use their discretion to i ssue an immediate response time when appropri ate to the circumstances . A \"24 -hour response time\" shall be done within 24 hours upon receiving any report or referral for investigation following a family assessment not involving immediate danger to the child. Initialing Investigations and Good Faith E fforts The investigation is considered \" initialed \" when the CPS social worker has made face -to-face contact with the alleged victim children. The following g ood faith efforts must be made to see the victim children and all other children in the household : i. Visiting the child's home at different times of the day. ii. Visiting the child's school or day care (if applicable and known) in an attempt to locate the child. iii. Contacting the reporter, if known, to elicit additional information about the child's location . iv. Reviewing FACES.NET and other database systems for additional information about the child and family , e.g., ACEDS (Automated Client Eligibility Determination System), which gives information on a family's eligibility for income assistance, or STARS ( Student Transmittal and Attendance Record System), which tracks students through the District's public school system. v. Contacting the police for allegations that a child's safety or health is in immediate danger, which is determined on a case -by-case basis. Note: I f efforts to see the child were unsuccessful, you must document and describe an explanation of the efforts in the child's record , as well as in FACES.NET . Include dates and times. IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TRIGGERS (NOT A COMPLETE LISTING !) Child is left alone. Child has a serious medical condition or serious injury that requires immediate medical attention. There is a death of a child. A hospital , physician , or the police are currently holding the child The child has been caged, bound, or is signif icantly physically restricted in the home. The caregiver has made a plausible or credible threat to seriously harm or abandon the child. A perpetrator who is known to have sexually abused a child still has access to the child. The family is living in an ab andoned building, or living without essential utilities, or there are environmental hazards present that are a safety concern. Walk -in reports . The caregiver is currently or was recently violent or out of control. The caregiver is mentally ill or developme ntally -disabled and cannot make a reasonable judgment about the child's safety . The caregiver is currently involved in dangerous criminal activity, e.g., weapons are found in the home or an arrest has occurred . There is a history of serious maltreatment, e.g., child fatality, child removed from home, or child at school with a bruise. Caregiver or child appears suicidal or homicidal. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 16 ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURES Once a referral has been assessed during the Hotline approval process, the referral is reviewed by a member of the CPS management . Assignments are then made to individual social workers through their direct supervisor or a designated member of CPS management. CPS recognizes the benefit of reviewing select referrals via a RED Team review (led by a CPS program manager ). This RED Team is held two or more times each day. The reviews, at a minimum, flag any referrals (both CPS referrals and I&Rs) that raise concerns re lated to appropriate next steps , and could also include screening them out . The RED Tea m may choose to override the FACES.NET Decision Tool Summary and Outcome Results , based on appropriate clinical assessment . Decisions to screen out a referral are made by the p anel and documented in FACES.NET by a CPS program manager or their designee CPS assignments require that social workers be available at irregular hours and always ready to perform the CPS duties of protecting children and youth. In addition to investigations, assignments might include linking referrals or 30 -day returns (see \"Links\" and \"30-day Returns \" below ). The assignment procedures below apply primarily to dayshift assignments. However, links and 30 -day returns may apply to after -hours shifts. Regular response investigations are assigned to the unit supervisors on a rotating bas is at the beginning of the dayshift. Consideration is given to the number of staff in each unit. Immediate response investigations are assigned to unit supervisors on a rotating basis throughout the shift. Assignments are made to the social worker from the direct supervisor or a member of the CPS management team . These assignments follow a rotation developed within your unit. The rotation patterns vary across units and shifts to best meet each unit's functioning needs. Some common scenarios are describe d below regarding other aspects of assignments: Regular Day Off (RDO) and Worker Leave Assignments (All Shifts) When a social worker or unit is on RDO, there will be no assignments , including links or 30 -day returns. These matters may be \"initia ted\" by an other social worker and returned to the assigned social worker for completion after he or she returns from RDO. When a social worker is on leave , but would have received a link or 30 -day return assignment, the investigation will be assigned to the unit of that worker. Companion Investigations (All Shifts) To streamline investigations that involv e families in the same household or investigations involving the same incident, CPS assigns these matters as \" companion \" investigations to be assessed by the same C PS social worker or unit . At the discretion of CPS management, companion investigations may be handled by separate units when there is a mixture of traditional and specialized allegations or when special circumstances warrant. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 17 Links (All Shifts) When t here is an open investigation on a family and a new allegation regarding this family is taken at the Hotline, a linked referral will be created. Linking a referral streamlines the investigation process to ensure that the same worker handles all open allega tions associated with the same family. Regardless of the type of investigation, links are assigned to the worker involved with the family. This includes linking a traditional allegation to a specialized investigation or vice versa, i.e., linking a speciali zed allegation during an investigation made by a traditional unit. The supervisor of the specialized unit will assist with specialized allegations if this consultation is needed. 30-Day Returns (All Shifts) CPS makes every effort to minimize duplication o f investigations and services. Therefore, when a social worker has closed an investigation within the last 30 days, and a new allegation is received on this same family, the new referral will be assigned to the same social worker previously assigned to the family. In contrast to the practice regarding links where investigation types might be combined, assignments of 30 -day returns are restricted to the same investigation type, e.g., specialized units will only receive 30 -day returns when the allegations are specialized. Day Shift Weekend Assignments All CPS social workers are required to work rotating weekends. At present , only supervisors of the traditional investigations units are assigned to weekends. These supervisors have discretion regarding which, a nd how many, investigations a worker retains on their permanent workload. This information is tracked through the shift-to-shift process. Staff members from the specialized units also work on the weekends. Their assignments are addressed by their respectiv e supervisors on the next business day. With the exception of removals, the traditional unit supervisor will not make permanent assignments to the specialized workers. Weekend staff members are tasked with ensuring that 24 -hour contacts and safety assessme nts are completed for as many investigations as possible. As a result, an \"all hands\" approach is frequently necessary when determining work assignments. Ideally, specialized investigations will be first given to specialized workers but these may also be a ddressed by traditional workers. Specialized staff may need to assist with initia ting traditional investigations to reach the goal of ensuring child safety in a timely manner. If social workers need to conduct removals on investigations outside of their typical unit assignments, these investigations (whether specialized or traditional) will remain with the removal worker. Holiday Assignments (All Shifts) All CPS social workers are required to work at least one holiday during the year. Social workers may retain permanent assignments from the ir holiday shift . Information regarding permanent assignments is tracked through the shift-to-shift process. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 18 Removal Assignments At times it may be necessary for a social worker to con duct the removal of a child from a family that may also be the subject of a link or 30 -day return , and that may also be assigned a different social worker. In these instances, the two social workers must coordinate their efforts to best serve this family. If the non -removing social worke r has information pertinent to the removal and services referred for the family, they should attend the Family Team Meeting (FTM) ,1 confer with the assistant attorney general (AAG), and attend the initial hearing (along with the removing social worker). Th is worker is also responsible for completing the investigation. If the non -removing social worker has not yet met the family or does not have information pertinent to the removal or services for the family, consideration should be given to reassigning the investigation to the removing social worker. This decision will be made jointly between the supervisors of the respective social workers. Management Assignment Discretion In the best interests of children as well as CFSA employees, CPS management at all t imes retains the discretion to make assignment decisions through a panel review , based on a variety of relevant factors, including the need for \"new eyes\" on an investigation , or the availability of staff and resources. Additional Information on Referrals At times, a reporting source will provide the Hotline with additional information on referrals or cases that are already active with CFSA. When this information does not rise to the level of a new abuse or neglect referral, the information is emailed to you by Hotline staff. This new information should be explored and your findings documented in your investigation notes. 1 For more information on FTMs, see the CFSA Family Team Meeting policy. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 19 FOUNDATIONAL CPS SKILLS FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 20 FOUNDATIONAL CPS SKILLS COMMITMENT AND FLEXIBILITY The environment of CP S is fast paced, yet rewarding. Social workers who do this work must not only be committed, they must also have flexibility and strong organizational skills to work under the mandated time constraints that have been established to meet the needs of vulnera ble families . Additionally, all social workers must comply with federal and District standards alongside the A gency 's Practice Model . Keep in mind that you are a professional social worker as well as being a child welfare professional. Professionalism is d isplayed by a strong work ethic, commitment to children and families, high quality social work practice, and an evident respect for time and attendance. THE PROFESSIONAL HELPING RELATIONSHIP \"The potential value of a sound relationship base cannot be overlooked...the relationship conveys interest in and acceptance of the client as a unique and worthwhile person and builds sufficient trust...\" (Cormier and Cormier) It is important that every CPS program manager, supervisor, social worker, and family support worker understand the importance of building the professional helping relationship by maximizing existing strengths as well as developing new ones. T he \"Core Conditions of the Helping Relationship\"2 include respect, empathy, and genuineness. These are th e essential conditions for laying the foundation for engagement, and for developing any professional helping relationship. Regardless of your title, w hen you project these attributes as you intervene in the lives of families, caregive rs and children, you provide an opportunity for everyone - yourself included - to experience a sense of \"being understood\" and valued. The natural outcome is a relationship where both parties are more willing to engage in helping one another as well as themselves. 2 Rogers, C. (1957). The necessary and sufficient conditions of therapeutic personality change. Journal of Consulting Psychology, 21, 95 -103 FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 21 Respect, Empathy, and Genuineness (Definitions of respect, empathy, and genuineness from New York State Office of Children and Family Services Supervisory CORE Curriculum developed by SUNY Research Foundation/CDHS) These are the three core attributes that you mus t project in order to develop relationships with families and to help them get their needs met while promoting safety for their children. Respect -\"...valuing another person because he/she is a human being. Respect implies that being a human being has value in itself.\" When you display respect you show that you believe that human beings are worthy of respect and that you understand the uniqueness of each person, and you believe that people can change. When you communicate respect , you accomplish the fol lowing positive goals: Reinforcing caregiver strengths Communicating warmth Suspending critical judgment Demonstrating commitment Developing empathy Empathy - \"...the process of tuning into (feeling) another person's feelings, developing a sense of what th e situation means to and feels like for the individual, and communicating understanding and compassion to that person. It is in the nature of empathy that we build a bridge between ourselves and others.\" You display empathy when you develop the followin g skills: Tuning into another person's feelings Communicating compassion Expressing your desire to understand Learning what is important to the family Genuineness - \"...involves being aware of one's own feelings and making a conscious choice about how to respond to the other person, based on what will be most helpful in facilitating communication and developing a good relationship.\" Expressing genuineness includes the following positive actions: Being yourself Remaining non -defensive Matching your verbal and nonverbal behaviors Each of these core attributes is critical for reinforcing the helping relationships between CFSA staff as well as with our clients and external stakeholders. When embarking on any investigation, check yourself on each of these t hree attributes, so that you can be your best professional self when engaging with families. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 22 OBJECTIVITY Objectivity is the principle of examining situations without bias. As a CPS social worker, you must be objective enough to systematically evaluate c lients and their situations in an unbiased , factual way. THE IMPORTANCE OF OBJECTIVITY Throughout the investigation process it is very important that you remain OBJECTIVE. To m aintain objectivity throughout the CPS response , you should consider the follow ing require ment s: Be aware of your own values, beliefs, feelings, and needs ; consider their influence on your perceptions . Pay careful attention to detail when making observations . Conduct an open, systematic search for facts before drawing conclusions . Practice consistency in your decision -making , following policy and procedures over emotion . UNDERSTANDING AND ENGAGING THE FAMILY SYSTEM Families often become involved in the child welfare system because of disturbances in the family system , usually due to changes in the larger environment or within the family itself. In order to assess safety and assist the family, the assessment must be made within the required response time . When you respond according to the response time noted on the referral, it allows you to accurately determine whether there are any safety factors that place the child in immediate or impending danger. During the assessment you will examine and evaluate the home conditions , and you will interview and observe all of the children in the ho usehold, including the alleged victim, parent or caregiver, alleged maltreater , and every other household member . Finding a CPS worker at the door almost always arouses discomfort and undermines emotional security, as well as threatens the family' s balance. When conducting an investigation of reported child abuse or neglect, the best way to start any interview is by engaging the alleged maltreater, caregiver, or family member . Engagement is the process of connecting with the child or youth, fath er, mother, extended family, primary caregiver, and other team members for the purpose of building an authentic, trusting, and collaborative working relationship. When you \"engage\" with a family, you actively work with them to promot e safety, permanence, and well-being for their children. To be successful, you must also embrace the core conditions of the helping relationship : respect, empathy , and genuineness , and you must embrace the following key elements : Active listening to each family member Develo ping an understanding of the family's past experiences, current situation, concerns, strengths, and potential Responding quickly to a family's concrete needs Clearly establishing the purpose of involvement with the family FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 23 Being aware of one's own biases an d prejudices about families Validating the participatory role of the family in planning and making decision s for their child Being consistent, reliable , and honest with families Fully disclosing information with families Honoring the culture, racial, ethn ic, linguistic, and religious or spiritual backgrounds of children, youth, and families , as well as respect ing difference s in sexual orientation Engagement Remember the core conditions of the helping relationship in all of your interactions with families . CPS social workers should never read the allegations to the family, at least not as they are narrated on the referral. Reading the allegations word for word may place the reporter and the children at risk of harm. You may also miss critical information b y focusing on specific incidents when a broader conversation would yield a truer picture of the family situation. Remember, all members of the household must be interviewed alone and separately. This process allows you to gain individual explanations of th e allegations on the referral to gather information about the presence of safety factors and to assess for evidence of any abuse or maltreatment. Adults must be interviewed separately to ensure that they are not influenced by others and that their individu al voice is heard. Children must also be interviewed separately for the same reasons, including separate from the caregiver and alleged maltreater, as well as any other children in the home. Later in the assessment, it may be of use to interview adults and children together to be able to observe their interactions, and to jointly plan for the family. Engaging Challenging Clients In all probability, a certain subset of your clients will become upset, hostile, verbally abusive , or threatening. These individu als can be caregivers, relatives, youth , or even professional members of the community. When handling a difficult conversation or phone call, the key role you are expected to play is one of a calming influence so that you can gather the pertinent informat ion that will help to protect (or save) a child. The following popular strategies are useful for minimizing an angry or verbal attack from a client: 1) Simple Listening : Wait until the person is finished talking. Listen and wait for him or her to take a brea th, and then ask a directed question, such as \"What can I do to help you?\" Your tone should be determined, not placating. 2) Active Listening : Make a genuine attempt to put yourself in the other person's situation as best you can. Listen to what is not being said as well as the words that are expressed. Identify the underlying emotions. 3) Acknowledgement: Respond honestly - and respectfully - when you calmly acknowledge the person's position. You might say, \"I can see how something like that could cause some a nger.\" or \"If that happened to me, I would be angry, too.\" This confirms the legitimacy of the emotion, but it also diffuses the approach the caller has taken to communicate the intensity of the emotion. 4) Apologizing: Sincerely apologizing for anything in t he situation that you recognize as problematic is not the same as taking the blame. You can always say, \"I'm so sorry that happened to you\" or \"I'm sorry the situation is so frustrating.\" This allows the individual to feel that they are not alone, that you identify with them in the particular circumstance, and that a certain measure of trust can be invested in you as the worker. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 24 5) Agreeing: There are usually three truths to any given situation - your truth, the other person 's truth, and then, THE truth. It is always important to listen for THE truth. Agreeing with the truth of a situation can help redirect the interaction towards a productive outcome. 6) Inviting Criticism: Sometimes it is effective to invite the client to get their criticisms out in the open. Yo u might say something like, \"Go ahead and tell me everything that has you upset. Don't hold anything back. I want to hear all that you have to say.\" It may seem at first that this strategy intensifies their emotional state but eventually, the distraught pe rson will expend themselves and you will have the opportunity to continue gathering necessary facts. TEAMING Teaming is the foundation of the District's child welfare practice and a core component of your practice when you are addressing child abuse and neglect. By teaming with the family and other team members , you will gain the advantage of genuine collaborat ion during case planning and decision -making. As a CPS social worker and licensed clinician, you must use your expertise and practice wisdom to wo rk with families in ways that encourage them to fully participate in the assessment, case planning , and other key decisions in volved with CPS intervention. Remember that your efforts are more likely to succeed when clients are involved and actively partic ipating in the process. Key Outcomes of Effective Teaming: Childre n, youth , and families benefit from active involvement . Collaboration supports sound decisions and coordinated, effective services . Children and youth achieve permanence promptly . When you team with the family, you allow the child (when developmentally appropriate) or youth, birth parents (including non -custodial parents), extended family, and caregivers to participate in the decision -making process regarding safety, permanence, and well being. As a joint process between the entire family and other professionals, the team's insight becomes a part of the CPS assessment. As the CPS social worker, you will team with families during the FTM process, and you may also team with the non -offen ding caregiver in developing a safety plan. You may team as well with a teen in the home around what they believe their family needs, as well as external professionals. Keep in mind that when you team with the family, you improve their chances for successf ul outcomes! BASIC INTERVIEWING The interview is the primary method used to gather information from the children and families you will meet in your work. In fact, your ability to perform your primary respon sibilities depends in large part on your intervi ewing skills. During your initial contact with the family, your goal is to obtain and assess select information to make informed and effective decisions on behalf of the children, and to help develop an appropriate set of interventions. The CPS interview c an be a very difficult part of your involvement with families. The core helping conditions of empathy, respect , and genuineness will support you throughout this important process. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 25 Introduction When beginning an interview with a caregiver , it is best to start broadly before narrowing in on the allegations. For example, begin the conversation by introducing yourself and explaining the reasons why you are there to speak with them : \"My name is [....] and I'm representing the District of Columbia's Child & F amily Services Agency. I am here because there are some concerns about the safety of your child. The reason for my visit is to make sure that you and your children are safe, and if necessary, to assist you and your family in keeping them safe. To do this I need to ask you some questions about your children and family. Please know that I will carefully listen to whatever you have to say. You can also tell me of any concerns you have.\" During the introduction, explain both the philosophy of CPS and your ob ligation to conduct a comprehensive investigation on the well -being of the family. This will justify your request for certain information, particularly when you ask to see children who may not be the direct subject of a report. For example: \"When we receiv e a report from the Hotline, part of what we do in CPS is check on the safety and well-being of everyone in the family. That means I need to talk with you about the basic things you do as a caregiver, for example, feeding and clothing your family, maintain ing the household, and so on. I also need to learn about supervision and discipline of the children, and so forth. Afterward I'll need to talk with your children individually to hear their thoughts about your family.\" Remember that your conversation with t he alleged maltreater (or non -offending parent or caregiver) is about getting to know the family dynamics and how the family functions as a whole, not just one specific level. Many times you will address the allegations through this introductory, general conversation. It is important to avoid accusatory language that may instigate or elevate tension . Try to use words like \"concerns\" or \"questions\" rather than \"allegations\". Later in the interview you may have to be more direct in your questioning but the i nitial process should take place with a conversational tone. Special Note: not all standards work with every client. That is why interviewing is more art than science. If you are dealing with a hostile client or a client who is fixated on the allegations, you may have to begin with direct questioning to make any progress in the investigation. Either way, use your engagement and conflict -resolution skills. Hopefully, you can develop a collaborative dialogue as you continue the interviewing and investigative process. REMINDER: YOU CANNOT REVEAL A REPORTING SOURCE! If the caregiver insists on knowing the reporting source, be prepared to redirect the conversation. Explain frankly to the caregiver the legal reasons why you cannot share this information. Use empa thic language: \"It's reasonable for you to wonder where this report came from. If I were you, I would want to know as well but because of the rules I have to follow, I can't confirm or deny the reporting source. It's just a legal fact that people who conta ct CPS have the right to remain anonymous. I do know, however, that sometimes people don't know the whole situation or make false reports. You can imagine that the reporter might fear retaliation so they need to know that they can safely FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 26 report legitimate concerns. That's why it's so important for you to have this opportunity to share your information with me and for me to keep an open mind when I come out to investigate. We don't know what is true without talking with you. So I'm hoping we can sit down tog ether and sort through this report. The most important thing is the safety of children.\" Key points to remember When you show up at the door , you will likely be unwelcome . Building rapport and engag ing the family in the interview process begins when you first introduce yourself. Explain the purpose of the interview. Determine whether or not the caregiver understand s your explanation of the purpose of the interview. Ask for his or her questions or concerns. Engagement After you have introduced yourse lf and explained the reason for the interview, you will continue to build rapport with the family member and gather the information you need to assess the safety of the children. Ask general questions about the family. If there is more than one caregiver, is important to interview each caregiver separately and also to compare the answers of all family members. Key point to remember Pay attention to the emotional state of the family. Family members experience a variety of powerful emotions and may express t heir anger, fear, and frustration during the interview. A highly -charged or emotional family member may not be able to provide clear and detailed information. Show your concern; this often helps to decrease the level of tension. Free Narrative When it is time to discuss the allegations, remember to avoid accusatory language. Do not read the allegations described in the referral snapshot. Start by explaining why you are there, and then asking questions that will allow the caregiver to have an opportunity to provide his or her own version of the events . The following example is a guideline for you: \"So I'm here because some concerns about your children were brough t to the Agency's attention. I'd really like to hear your thoughts about how things are going with your family . We'd also like to offer assistance if there is something we can do to help your family. \" At this stage of the interview, avoid interrupting the caregiver's account of the circumstances. Allow them to respond at their own pace ; then you c an ask follow -up questions afterwards. Let the caregiver talk about what is important to them. They will likely tell you significant information about their thoughts and feelings on the family , even if you do not immediately get to the heart of the allegations. You r ability to listen and acknowledge what is important to your client will provide a foundation to move into a more specific conversation about the allegations. Open -ended Requests and Questions Once the caregiver has had an opportunity to expr ess their thoughts on why you are investigating the family, you can begin exploring the allegations by asking open -ended questions and requesting FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 27 information. Again, do not directly identify the allegations as described in the intake report . Rather, start with generalized questioning. EXAMPLES OF APPROPRIATE V ERSU S INAPPROPRIATE QUESTIONS APPROPRIATE INAPPROPRIATE Please share with me your understanding of how your daughter was injured. So tell me, why did you punch your daughter in the eye? How is yo ur child doing in school? Does your son or daughter enjoy school? Why is your child falling so far behind in school? How come your child is in danger of repeating a grade? How is your child's school attendance? This allegation says you do not send your child to school. Let's talk about the use of alcohol. It looks to me like you have a drinking problem. Specific Questions It is important to realize that some people do not view their actions as maltreatment and most people do not readily admit to mistreating their child. Reminder: denial of an allegation does not automatically mean that the allegation is not true, nor does it imply that there are no legitimate safety concerns for the child. To gather as many facts as possible, it may be necessary t o ask very pointed, specific questions regarding the allegations. You may need to be equally specific when requesting information that will influence your overall assessment. How and when you discuss or describe the nature of the allegations will be determ ined based on the circumstances of the investigation, the family circumstances, and your own judgment. Concluding the Interview A respectful conclusion to the interview builds trust and opens the door for ongoing or future engagement opportunities with the caregiver . Always give the client an opportunity to ask questions. Always thank him or her for taking the time to speak to you, and remember to provide your contact information . All essential information has now been collected, and as many gaps as p ossible have been filled, including information on demographics and family composition. At this stage, you will give the individual an opportunity to share any additional information that may not have been revealed during this Exploratory Stage of the inte rview. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 28 Key points to remember Summarize the key points, decisions, and any additional information that have been discussed. Ask the individual if they have any questions , and respond honestly and directly. Discuss future actions and next steps. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 29 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR CPS PRACTICE FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 30 PHILOSOPHY OF COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATIONS When CPS staff accepts an investigation regarding a family, we accept a \"special relationship\" with them which involves teaming to support the safety, well -being, and permanence for the children and the family overall. To this end, CPS involvement is not solely allegation focused; rather it is focused on carrying out the Agency 's mission. CONFIDENTIALITY D.C. Official Code \u00a74-1303.06 states that \"information acquired... which identifies individual children reported as or found to be abused or neglected or which identifies other members of their families or other persons or other individuals shall be considered confidential.\" Further, according to the Code, t his information may only be released or divulged for the following reasons: Identification of abuse or neglect Identification of service needs or resources Provision of treatment or direct services for the child or individual Investigation or review of ch ild fatalities by representatives of the Child Fatality Review Committee Additionally, the Code notes that ...persons or agencies who are not covered by confidentiality requirements comparable to those [above], to whom information is released pursuant to this section, must sign a statement that they will not divulge such confidential information for purposes unrelated to the purposes of treatment, identification or evaluation. You must always exercise discretion when sharing information for the purposes identified above. In general, information should be shared in accordance with the exceptions noted above and on a \"need to know basis\" for the purposes discussed. If you have questions, please consult your management team or the General Counsel's office. In many areas of investigative work, you will find that you have the ability to ask questions of and receive information from collateral sources. You must recognize that you may not always be able to, or need to, share information in response. Acclimate y ourself to this concept and be able to comfortably discuss this with individuals. Many people will still be willing to share information with you once they understand the boundaries within which you have to operate. In general, you cannot confirm or deny that the Agency has involvement with a given child or family. If collateral sources of information reach out to you without proper releases of information, you may accept information from them and explain that if the Agency is aware of this family, the in formation will be forwarded to the assigned social worker and management team. You may, at times, determine that the information sharing is warranted with certain collateral sources but you should take care to obtain proper releases ( Authorization to Discl ose Information ) of information whenever possible, even though this may not be a legal requirement. If you are not able to obtain releases of information, and FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 31 information needs to be shared for the purposes discussed above, you must limit this sharing to information that is absolutely necessary. Biological Parents Who Are Not Primary Caregivers Biological parents usually have a right to information on CPS investigations involving their children, provided that their parenting rights have not been terminat ed. Provided that you have properly identified an individual as a biological parent whose rights are intact, you may share information about the investigation with this individual. You must still exercise discretion when sharing the information, ensuring that it follows the provisions discussed above. One parent's information shall not be able to be shared with the other parent , but information concerning their child in common could be. Information on a half -sibling should not be shared with the non -legal guardian or custodian. Specific care should be used when sharing information with a parent who is not a primary caregiver or who may have a level of hostility toward, or estrangement from, the primary caregiver. You should realize that at times, informat ion sharing might jeopardize the physical or emotional safety of a child or other individual. This must be considered prior to disclosing information. For example, a secondary parent may be entitled to information on the disposition of whether their child has been abused or neglected, but they may not be entitled to the details of how that determination was made, including demographic information and so forth. When in doubt, you should consult with your management team about confidentiality concerns. Neighbors Neighbors can be a vital source of information for your investigation. You are allowed to speak with neighbors but you are not allowed to reveal that you have an investigation on a given child or family, as this breaks their confidentiality. You may explain to neighbors that you would like to speak with a given child or family but you cannot give any detail as to the reason for such contact. You may explain to neighbors that your job is to protect children and that they may talk with you about any co ncerns they have regarding the well -being of any child, including the ones about whom you may have directly asked. If you receive information from neighbors that is critical to the investigation, talk with them about their willingness to share their name or contact information and whether they are willing to be witnesses to this information. If they are not willing to share their information in an official capacity, you should respect this. You are still able to document their concerns in FACES.NET (as an anonymous source) and use this toward your overall decision -making and disposition , if you believe the source of information is credible ( see definition of \"credible evidence \" under Appendix I: Glossary of Terms ). Extended family For investigations that do not involve a removal, extended family do not have a right to information about the investigation. If you are contacted by extended family, you may receive information from them but cannot share information (unless it is related to the purposes discusse d in the introduction to this section). You cannot confirm or deny involvement with a given family without proper releases of information. Remember that many extended family members care deeply for the children and families about whom they may be contactin g you. Empathize with their concern. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 32 There are times when you will be able to communicate with extended family with proper consent from the parent or caregiver. This consent should be in writing for the protection of all parties. In these situations, thi s communication should still be handled thoughtfully on a \"need to know\" basis. The only information shared should be that which is related to the planning of the family 's safety and well - being . Even then, only the components that involve the extended fami ly should be shared . In removal situations, you are able to share with extended family that a child is in CFSA custody. Without a proper release of information, you are not able to share any reasons why the child is in care. You may talk with family memb ers in general about CPS processes and also receive information from family members that may be critical to the investigation. Family members should be informed of the Family Team Meeting (FTM) process but should also be made aware that the legal caregiver s give consent for extended family to be invited to this meeting. Family members may be informed of the initial Court hearing and, if the judge permits, may be present in the hearing to become aware of the circumstances of the removal. Early Identificat ion of Kin It is very important to make efforts to identify kin in the early stages of the investigation. The identification of kin does not mean that you are planning to remove the children from their home . Kin can also serve in a key supportive role and serve as an invaluable resource for children and families that can help to prevent children from coming into care. As the CPS social worker, you r goal is to make early efforts to identify relatives for every child that becomes known to the Agency. The questions below will serve as a guide for your gather ing of family information. INITIAL CPS QUESTIONS FOR BIRTH FAMILIES 1. Do you have any family members who would be willing to physically care for your children if necessary ? 2. What are the se family members' names, addresses, and phone numbers ? What is their relations hip to the child ? For example, is this an aunt, uncle, or grandparent? 3. For the identified relatives, please explain the ir prior relationship and level of bonding with your children. 4. To the bes t of your knowledge do the se relatives have space available in their home to accommodate the children if necessary ? Explain, if possible , the current sleeping arrangements in the relative's home. 5. To the best of your knowledge , does anyone in the household have a criminal history with the last 5 years, or is anyone on active probation or parole? If yes, are you aware of what the charges are? 6. To the best of your knowledge, is anyone actively using drugs or does anyone have a current or prior history of ille gal drug activity in any of the identified above homes? FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 33 Multi -Disciplinary Team (MDT) Partners The multi -disciplinary team was established for the purposes of improving service provision to victims and their family , as well as for enhancing legal respon ses to child maltreatment. Therefore, you are able to share information with our MDT partners about investigations for the purposes discussed in the introduction to this section. DC MDT includes the following organizations: Child and Family Services Agen cy Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) o Youth Investigations Division (YID) o Special Victims Unit Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) Children's Advocacy Center (CAC) Office of the Attorney General (OAG) o Child Protection Section o Juvenile Section Unite d States Attorney's Office Service Providers As noted in the introduction to this section, you may share information with individuals who may be providing services to a child or family. The information you share must only be related to the service provi sion need . It should not fall outside of this scope. Whenever possible, obtaining an appropriate release of information is preferred. Custody Court Personnel You are prohibited from sharing information with Family C ourt personnel, including judges, when t he information is related to custody matters , unless you have received express permission from the CFSA Office of the Attorney General, Office of the General Counsel ( OAG -OGC). If you are approached for information in a custody proceeding, you must explain that you cannot confirm or deny involvement with a family . You should refer the individual requesting information to the OAG -OGC. Talking to Individuals Represented by Counsel While not expressly related to confidentiality, you must be prepared to speak with individuals who are represented by counsel, be it in the Family Court or during some other court proceeding. Counsel for an individual can express to their client that the client should not speak with you without representation. It is still up to the client to make a decision as to whether they will adhere to this. You are not required to speak with clients through their counsel and should not feel compe lled to do so. Your function is to assess for child maltreatment and to coordinate an appropriate p rofessional response to the concerns identified. Guardian ad Litems (GALs ) GALs in non -CPS cases (custody, juvenile, etc.) may have a legal right to information about a child or investigation. What, if any, information is disclosed must be determined in direct conjunction with OAG -OGC. If you are approached for information from a GAL, you must explain that you cannot confirm or deny involvement with a family , and then refer the individual requesting the information to OAG -OGC. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 34 INVESTIGATION TRACKING Investigations at CFSA are tracked by the biological mother's name. This has several implications for practice and there are a few exceptions. If the biological mother's name is not known at the time of the Hotline report, the investigation name will be \"Un known.\" It is your responsibility to change this to the correct name once the identity of the biological mother is learned. Please note that tracking the investigations in the biological mother's name does not automatically indicate that the mother is the maltreater . Please do not presume the mother is the maltreater based on the tracking mechanism! If there are alleged victim children in a home who have different mothers, there must be separate investigations for the children under each mother's name. Thes e are called \"companion investigations\" . At times you will deal with a mother who is a minor. This minor (sometimes referred to as a \"junior mom\") may or may not be the legal caregiver for her child . Investigation s involving the neglect or abuse of such a child will still be tracked under the junior mom's name. Any questions about her legal custody can be confirmed via the Domestic Relations division of DC Superior Court. (This applies to those families who were involved in DC Domestic Relations court only , and not courts in other jurisdictions ). If the junior mom resides as a minor with her own caregiver, you must determine whether that said caregiver is acting in loco parentis for the junior mom's child. If there are allegations against said caregiver, the y are still tracked in the investigation under the junior mom's name . If said caregiver is alleged to also neglect or abuse his/her own children (possibly including the junior mom ), this would be a separate companion investigation. Please note that we can substantiate allegations by the parent s, guardians , or custodian who are under 18 years of age. We can and should still open a case when appropriate. If the biological mother's rights have been terminated , and the father is unknown or unable to care for t he child, and the child has been adopted, the investigation will be tracked by the adoptive caregiver's name, regardless of the alleged maltreater. Guardianship and legal custody matters generally do not involve termination of parental rights (TPR) and the refore are still tracked under the name of the biological mother. If the biological mother's rights have been terminated , and the father is unknown or unable to care for the child, and the child has not been adopted, the investigation will be tracked based on the circumstances of the allegations. The decision will be made by the Hotline supervisor or a member of the CPS management team. If children are maltreated by a placement provider or other individual in an institutional setting, as defined by the CFS A Investigations Policy, the investigation will be tracked under the name of the organization that is the subject of the investigation. CULTURAL AND LANGUAGE CONSIDERATIONS With every CPS investigation and assessment, a person's history and culture may affect certain areas. As a CPS social worker, it is important that you gain an understanding of each family's culture . You must also recognize that a given culture cannot be defined simply as a static bundle of fixed traits. The following questions may be used as part of the assessment to guide your understand ing of cultural differences : What roles do males and females play in the family? FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 35 What is the role of religion for the family? How do the family's beliefs influence child -rearing practices? What is th e meaning, identity , and involvement of the larger homogeneous group (e.g. , race and nationality)? What family rituals, traditions , and behaviors exist? What is the usual role of children in the family? What is the perception of the role of children in soc iety? What types of discipline does the family consider to be appropriate? What are the family's attitudes or beliefs regarding health care? What are the family's sexual attitudes and values? Who is assigned authority and power of decision making? What tas ks are assigned based on traditional roles in the family? What are the communication styles in the family? How does the family solve problems? Deal with conflicts? A culturally sensitive CPS assessment recognizes that caregiver practices and family struct ures vary as the result of ethnic, community , and familial differences . This range can result in different but safe and adequate care for children within the parameters of the law. The CPS assessment process must acknowledge, respect , and honor the diversi ty of families. Simultaneously, CPS is obliged to protect children from cultural practices that fall under the definitions of abuse and neglect. The following examples , which are not exhaustive of cultural practices , are considered u nacceptable: Coining- a\" medicinal\" folk practice that involves the rubbing of heated oil on the skin, most commonly on the chest, back, or shoulders, and then vigorously rubbing a coin over the area in a linear fashion until a red mark is seen. Cupping (or cupping method) - a \"therapeutic \" method involving the application of suction by placing a vacu umized (usually by fire ) cup or jar onto the affected or any part of the body surface . Female Circumcision (or female genital mutilation [FGM ])-this practice comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non -medical reasons. LANGUAGE CONSIDERATIONS Individuals with a limited ability to communicate in English, either because t he individual speaks a foreign language or because there is sight, speech, and/or hearing impairments , are accommodated by the Agency through your Language Access Line Training (see Appendix IV: CPS Supporting Documentation for the Language Access Training Tip Sheet ). Limited English Proficiency (LEP) may impact the parent , caregiver, the children in need of protection, the alleged maltreater, other members of the household, key collateral contacts, as well as other relatives or key individuals who may ne ed explanations of the investigation process, the investigation findings, and the outcome of the investigation. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 36 Every client with LEP has the legal right to understand, as fully as possible, all significant CPS actions at each stage of the investigation process and service, including but not limited to the following: Investigation of the allegations of child abuse or neglect Adverse actions such as removal of a child from his or her home Case planning and service delivery It is your obligation as the CPS invest igative social worker to make reasonable efforts to provide information and services in a language or medium that the client can understand through the use of interpreters, translators, readers, or other methods. (See also the \"Reasonable Efforts\" section of this POM as well as Appendix Glossary for the CPS working definition of \"reasonable efforts\".) You must offer a translator or other communication support for every visit. If the client declines such services, please have them sign a statement indicat ing such and include it in your record. Note: Your efforts to provide bilingual or interpreter services must not delay or interfere with either of the following necessary actions: Protecting a child from harm or risk of harm Compliance with all federal and local laws, rules , and regulations In House Resources There are some CPS personnel who are bilingual. Talk with your supervisor about how to access support from your colleagues. Police Resources In emergency situations, police resources may be an op tion for communication with individuals with LEP. The police are our partners in assessing safety issues with children. Their various l iaison units (Latino, Asian, etc.) may be a resource for communication with families. Remembe r: The purpose of our police force is first to conduct law enforcement . To support MPD , you must ensure that you and the officer have a thorough understanding regarding the approach to and the dynamics of the investigation prior to beginning interpretation. Language Access Line Se rvices Language Access Line Services give you access to over -the-phone interpretation 24 hours -a-day, seven days a week. This program ensures that clients with LEP will have access to the services they need while simultaneously providing you with the supp ort you need to deliver those services. Every CPS investigator is required to take the Language Access Line training. Again, p lease see Appendix IV: CPS Supporting Documentation for information on utilizing the Language Access Line. NEVER use family me mbers, friends, or child victims as translators! Even with consent of the party , this is inappropriate. CPS does not use family members, friends, or children (including child victims) to interpret, translate, sign, or read for clients with LEP. An MPD officer, if present , who speaks the same language as the client may be used to translate for brief interactions that specifically assist a client's request or arrange s FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 37 for the requested translation services. Ideally, interpreters and translators will be profe ssionally trained or be a CPS staff person who is fluent in the client's preferred language. Some MPD officers are certified and can be used as an interpretation resource. Ensuring Comprehension of Written Material Notwithstanding LEP status, a client may have a limited ability to understand material written in his or her own language. When communicating your purpose, goals, and services to a client, you should verbally review written material with the client and the interpreter to ensure that it is fully understood . Removal Concerns If you must remove a child from his or her home, you must consider the child's language needs and assess the importance of placing the child with a foster family that speaks the same language. Language is not the only factor t o consider in placing the child, but it must not be neglected. You must ensure that any LEP needs are communicated to the Placement Services Administration. If the parent or caregiver speaks a language other than English, you must document the language on the complaint form and in FACES.NET to ensure that the Family Court will obtain a translator and assign an attorney who is appropriate for the client during all court hearings. Documentation You must carefully document all of the following information in FACES.NET : Any offer of an interpreter to assist in translation for a client (whether the client accepts or rejects the offer) When the use of an interpreter occurs The interpreter's name (e.g., the Language Access Line)or agency affiliation (e.g., staff at CFSA) The interpreter's relationship (if any)or professional affiliation with the person with LEP Use of any type of communication aids Your own ability (or inability) to communicate in the client's preferred language Any reason why an interpreter mig ht not have been used PROVISION OF REASONABLE ACCOMODATIONS FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES CFSA has an obligation to provide reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities so that there is no disruption in the CPS investigation process. The mo st common type of reasonable accommodation request s that social workers will encounter is a request for an interpreter for a hearing impaired client. To request an interpreter, social workers should complete a hearing impaired interpreter request form and submit it to the CFSA -designated ADA Coordinator. The request must be submitted at least 5 days in advance of the meeting. Once the social worker has completed the meeting, the social worker should then complete the log form to document the interaction and experience with the interpreter. For nonscheduled interactions, such as a CPS Investigation or removal, when an interpreter is needed, the Agency generally uses an interpreter provided by the Police Department. You should contact your supervisor of program manager if you uncover this need on an initial or subsequent visit during the FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 38 course of your investigation where you did not have prior knowledge of the need for the assistance of an interpreter. In the case of a removal where an interpreter is needed , the CPS social worker must contact the CFSA - designated ADA Coordinator and this individual will contact MPD on your behalf. Please refer to the policy on Services for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing for additional Information. PROTOCOL FOR DETERMI NING A CHILD'S BIOLOGICAL OR LEGAL CAREGIVER Biological parents Every child has two biological parents and neither should be overlooked in your investigation. You must exercise care, however, in determining the identity of biological parents and make every effort to obtain names, address es, telephone number s, and the nature of each parent's relationship with the child. For most investigations, the biological mother will be known but there may be times when the maternity is questioned. When this occurs, y ou should seek guidance from management and OAG - OGC . The identity of the biological father may not be legally obvious during many investigations. For the purposes of CFSA involvement with families, a man may be considered the father under the following circumstances: \u00b7 He was legally married to the mother at the time of the child's birth. \u00b7 His name is on the child's birth certificate. \u00b7 Paternity testing has been completed and demonstrates that he is the father. \u00b7 Court paperwork (paternity affidavit, c hild support documentation, etc.) exists , reflecting that he is the father. Whenever you face a question of maternity or paternity, you must view legally appropriate paperwork to show that the individual in question is in fact the biological parent. It i s not sufficient to simply hear that someone is named on a birth certificate or see unofficial paperwork suggesting that an individual is a parent. You must see the actual birth certificate yourself. Examples of unofficial paperwork might include a person' s name as the parent on a permission slip for a school field trip, or a person's name on a note excusing an absence from school. Seek guidance from your management and the OAG -OGC. Legal Caregivers Many families make informal (or formal) living arrangeme nts for the care of children . These may include the children residing in another home, which may be perfectly acceptable . You are still required to be aware of and in contact with a child's legal caregiver whenever you engage with a family. You must also e xercise care in situations where you are responsible for releasing a child to a caregiver (e.g., a child who is not picked up afterschool and presents to CPS for assistance). You may not release a child to a non -legal caregiver . You must verify a child's legal caregiver through legal paperwork that demonstrates the legal caregiver was changed that resulted in a new legal custody, guardianship, or adoption relationship. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 39 INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING OTHER JURISDICTIONS If the maltreatment occurred in another j urisdiction, but the family or children reside in the District of Columbia, you must complete the following tasks: Conduct an investigation to determine where the alleged maltreatment occurred. Make a report of the alleged maltreatment to the jurisdiction where it occurred. Conduct a courtesy interview and home visit , if requested by the other jurisdiction. Consider whether an investigation or safety check is warranted in the District , given the overall mosaic of the family. This decision will be made in co ncert with your management team. Under no circumstances may you close an accepted CPS investigation without verifying the whereabouts of the alleged victim children and family , and ensuring that a CPS professional has made contact with them. Consult with t he OAG -OGC for legal advice as needed. If the maltreatment occurred in the District but the family lives or is visiting in a nearby jurisdiction , you may have the ability to enter that jurisdiction to visit the family. The following must be considered and any questions should be directed to your management team or the OAG -OGC : You may visit a child or family in another jurisdiction to ensure that you have physically met and interviewed required parties to the investigation. You may NEVER physically remove a child from another jurisdiction. If, when visiting another jurisdiction, you encounter safety concerns those must be immediately reported to that jurisdiction's CPS and/or police department. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 40 INABILITY TO IDENTIFY OR LOCATE A CHILD OR FAMILY No CFSA CP S investigation is closed solely on the grounds that the child could not be located until good faith efforts have been made by the CPS worker to locate the child and family. If the child or family cannot be immediately located, investigative efforts must b e elevated and the following steps , if applicable since they might not all apply, taken concurrently with a sense of urgency to thoroughly exhaust all avenues for locating the child and family: Make a minimum of three unannounced home visits at different t imes within a 48 -hour time frame with at least one visit between the hours of 8pm - 8am. Use Internet search engines such as http://www.whitepages.com, http://www.zabasearch.com, and http://www.freeality.com/ . Mail a certified letter in the family's primar y language to the last known address, referral address, or address listed on the ACEDS report . Contact the reporter to obtain additional information on locating the child and family . Visit the child's neighborhood school or day care center if enrollment is known . If enrollment is unknown, request information from the DCPS Penn Attendance Intervention Center at 202-541- 6411, or the Douglass Attendance Intervention Center at 202-698-2461. Efforts should also be made to reach the emergency contact person on fi le with the school . Contact the MPD Truancy Office r assigned to the child's school and request assistance in gaining access to the family (when allegations warrant and there has been involvement with the family) . Request MPD to check their database for an y involvement with the particular family or address . Conduct a c riminal background search o n any known family members for access to addresses or other contact information . If the family has not responded within 1 week of your attempts to make contact, requ est assistance from the Diligent Search Unit , and follow -up on the results. No report shall be closed without receipt and follow -up on diligent search results . Interview neighbors, relatives, and other collateral resources . Confirm that the family is no lo nger residing in the residence ( e. g., via landlord, property records, or verified alternative residence). Contact the Healthy Family Thriving Communities Collaboratives to determine whether the family is known to them or if the family has received servic es from them . Consult with the AAG staff to determine if a Pre-Petition Custody Order is warranted . Check with other governmental agencies for possible involvement, including the Department of Behavioral Health , Department of Human Services, and the Income Maintenance Administration, etc. FAILED ATTEMPTS FOR INITIAL CONTACT An investigation is considered initia led when the alleged victim children have been seen and assessed and appropriate safety planning has occurred with the caregiver. Usually there will be credible l ocating information for the family (address, school, etc.) but successful contact does not occur for any number of reasons. It is the policy of CPS to complete Good Faith Efforts (GFE) to see each victim child and all other children in the household in every investigation. GFEs must include but are not limited to the following steps: 1. Did the SW go to the school/daycare to see the child? (Yes, Attempt ed, or Not Applicable) 2. Did the SW go to the home to see the child? (Yes, Attempt ed, or Not Applicable) FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 41 3. Did the SW try to obtain information regarding the child's whereabouts via FACES.NET , STARS, ACEDS or any other system which may help identify the location of the child? (Yes, Attempt ed, or Not Applicable) 4. Did the SW contact the reporter of the allegation to ge t additional information regarding the child's whereabouts? (Yes, Attempt ed, or Not Applicable) 5. Was another attempt made to see the child at home during a different time frame? (Yes, Attempt ed, or Not Applicable) 6. Based on the allegations, is the victim chi ld in immediate danger? (Yes or Not Applicable) 7. If the answer to #6 is yes, were the police contacted for assistance in finding the child? (Yes, Attempt ed, or No) Note : In those instances where the victim child has not been seen via initial attempts, you must complete the \"GFE Template\" (see appendix 1V-16). If the answer to any question is \"Attempted or Not Applicable\" , you are required to provide a brief explanation regarding why this measure could not be met . Attach the referral to the template to be s ubmitted to your supervisor and program manager. Key Things to Remember Regarding Good Faith Efforts GFEs are attempts to see victim children and all other children in the household within 48 hours of the time listed on the report . GFEs are specific to th e victim child . GFEs can be successfully completed even if the child ha s not been seen, only if you have followed and documented all the seven steps listed above . Please attach the GFE template to applicable referrals . Please make sure that your supervisor /program manager signs the referral . When the victim child and all other children in the household have been seen, the template does not have to be entered . CLIENT REFUSAL TO ACCESS A CHILD, FAMILY, OR HOME You will encounter occasions when you are aware of the location of a child or family but cannot access aspects of the family situation typically required for a complete CPS investigation (including interviews of the alleged victim, siblings, household members, caregivers, or living spaces). Listed below are strategies for common scenarios. These types of matters should be discussed with your management team as they arise, as well as during any review process (e.g. 18 day, red team) to ensure that all possible steps are taken . You should complete the st eps discussed above for \"unable to locate \" clients (if applicable ). In addition , you should consider the following steps in consultation with your management team for families who are refusing to cooperate with a CPS investigation : Contact CPS management team immediately . Contact MPD for assistance . Contact the OAG -CPS section attorneys to determine whether a Pre -Petition Custody Order is appropriate . Convene a case staffing to determine plan of action . FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 42 Complete Pre -Petition Custody Order, if appropriate . CPS AND THE LAW FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 43 INTRODUCTION The purpose of any state or local CPS administration is to protect children from being abused and neglected, as well as helping families to access services to acquire the skills and knowledge to prevent further abuse and neglect. As a CPS investigative social worker, your intervention into the lives of families being served by CFSA is guided by federal legislation, in addition to the D.C. Official Code and the District's Municipal Regulations (DCMR). In particular, fe deral legislation sets all national CPS practice standards by defining uniform goals for CPS cases across the country. CFSA's practice standards, policies, and procedures are fully compliant with both federal and District rules and regulations. As a CPS so cial worker, it is important that you understand the District's current laws pertaining to child abuse and neglect. Both the Code and DCMR are internet -accessible at http://go vernment.westlaw.com/linkedslice/default.asp?SP=DCC -1000 and at www.dcregs.dc.gov respectively. Finally, you are obliged to have a working knowledge of the District's Family Court system, and of course, CFSA's P olicy Manual which is accessible on the Agency's website under \"About CFSA\" on the main page at www.cfsa.dc.gov . THE ESTABLISHMENT ACT The Child and Family Services Agency (CFSA) Establishment Act of April 2001 (D.C. Official Code \u00a7 4 - 1303.01a) confirms CFSA's authority as a separate cabinet -level agency responsible for the care of child welfare services in the District. As a result, the Agency (through its director) reports directly to the Mayor. The Establishment Act specifically gives legal authority for CFSA to do what appropriately needs to be done in order to protect children's well -being and to keep them safe either in or out of their homes. This authority is granted through the following sections of the D.C. Official Code: 1. \u00a74-1303.01a (b)(3) - CFSA has the responsibility to receive and to respond to reports of child abuse and neglect. 2. \u00a74-1303.01a (b)(3A) - In response to reports of abuse and neglect, CFSA shall assess the strengths and needs of those children and families involved with the reported allegations. 3. \u00a74-1303.01a (b)(6) - The Agency is responsible for safeguarding the rights and protecting the welfare of children when their parents, guardians, or custodians are unable to do so. 4. \u00a74-1303.01a (b)(4) - When necessary for their safety and well -being, CFSA may remove children from their homes or other places. In addition to the above authorities, \u00a7 4-1301.06 entrusts CFSA with certain obligations regarding the investigation of child abuse and neglect report s. The Agency must complete all investigations within 30 days of the first notice; an additional 5 days are allowed for completing the final report. Documentation of each investigation shall include (at a minimum) the following information: (1) The nature, ext ent, and cause of the abuse or neglect, if any; (2) If a mental injury is suspected, an assessment of the suspected mental injury by a physician, a psychologist, or a licensed clinical social worker; (3) If the suspected abuse or neglect is determined to be substa ntiated: (A) The identity of the person responsible for the abuse or neglect; (B) The name, age, sex, and condition of the abused or neglected child and all other children in the home; (C) The conditions in the home at the time of the alleged abuse or neglect; (D) Whether there is any child in the home whose health, safety, or welfare is at risk; and (E) Whether any child who is at risk should be removed from the home or can be protected by the provision of resources. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 44 Special Note: CFSA policy requires more extensive informa tion than legally required to be included in your case documentation, including the hard case file and data entered in FACES.NET. MEDICAL RECORDS \u00a7 4-1301.06b. Obtaining Records (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon the Agency's request, a per son who is required to report suspected incidents of child abuse or neglect under \u00a74 -1321.02 shall immediately provide the Agency copies of all records in the possession of the person or the person's employees of: (1) A child who is the subject of an investiga tion of child abuse or neglect; provided, that the records bear directly on the allegations of abuse or neglect being investigated; and (2) Any other child residing in the household where the abuse or neglect is alleged to have occurred when the Agency has a reasonable suspicion that the child's health, safety, or welfare is at risk; provided, that the records bear directly on the basis of the Agency's suspicion. (b) The Agency shall request the records as needed for its investigation under this part. (c) The Agency shall not be charged a fee for the records. (d) If the Agency determines that the report of abuse or neglect is an unfounded report or an inconclusive report, as defined in \u00a74 -1301.02, the Agency shall immediately destroy all copies of any records it has recei ved under this section. Note that the requested records must \"bear directly\" on the allegations being investigated. TEN TYPES OF NEGLECT : D.C. OFFICIAL CODE \u00a7 16-2301(9)(A)( i-x) The D.C. Official Code contains 10 legal definitions of a neglected child t hat are important for every CPS social worker to know and understand. It is important to understand that \"abuse\" is a subset of \"neglect\" as an abused child is the first of the 10 definitions. Unfortunately, the D.C. Official Code is not written as clear a s it could be. A specific example of that is in the first definition of a neglected child includes both an \"abandoned or abused\" child. In addition, parents, guardians, or custodians are not \"charged with\" or \"responsible for\" neglect, but rather, the chil d is found to be a \"neglected child\". This means that it is about the status or condition of the child and not necessarily the fault of the parent or caretaker. You should familiarize yourself with each of the following legal definitions for the 10 types of neglect. Be mindful that you should consider these legal definitions at the beginning, middle, and end of each of your investigations . The onset of every investigation must begin with an investigation to determine if a child meets at least one of th e definitions of neglect. During the middle of the investigation, all 10 definitions must be considered. At the end, you must consider whether the child is a neglected child according to one or more of the 10 D.C. Official Code Citations. REMEMBER: these c ases are about the status of the child and not about placing blame on a parent, guardian, or custodian. If questions arise during an investigation as to whether the circumstances, as you see them, rise to the level of neglect, consult your management team. Should you need legal advice, please consult the OAG -OGC for non -court - involved cases and the OAG -CPS for court -involved cases. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 45 ONE - The term \"neglected child\" means a child D.C. Official Code \u00a716 -2301(9)(A) i ...who has been abandoned or abused by his or her parent, guardian, or custodian, or whose parent, guardian, or custodian has failed to make reasonable efforts to prevent the infliction of abuse upon the child. The term \"reasonable efforts\" includes filing a petition for civil protection from in tra-family violence. \"Abandoned \" is defined in D.C. Official Code \u00a716 -2316(d) (1) in four parts: I. The child is a foundling whose parents have made no effort to maintain a parental relationship with the child and reasonable efforts have been made to ident ify the child and to locate the parents for a period of 4 weeks since the child was found. II. The child's parent gave a false identity at the time of the child's birth, since then has made no effort to maintain a parental relationship and reasonable efforts h ave been made to locate the parent for at least 4 weeks since his or her disappearance. III. The child's parent, guardian, or custodian is known but has abandoned the child in that he or she has made no reasonable effort to maintain a parental relationship with the child for at least 4 months. IV. The child has resided in a hospital located in the District of Columbia for at least 10 calendar days following the birth of the child, despite a medical determination that the child was ready for discharge from the hospit al, and the parent, guardian, or custodian of the child did not undertake any action or make any effort to maintain a parental, guardianship, or custodial relationship or contact with the child. \"Abuse \" is defined in D.C. Official Code \u00a716 -2301(23)(A) in three parts: i. the infliction of physical or mental injury upon a child ii. sexual abuse or exploitation of a child iii. negligent treatment or maltreatment of a child \"Unexplained injury \" is defined in D.C. Official Code \u00a716 -2316(c) as when ...the petition allege s a neglected child by reason of abuse, evidence of illness or injury to a child who was in the custody of his or her parent, guardian, or custodian for which the parent, guardian or custodian can give no satisfactory explanation shall be sufficient to jus tify an inference of neglect. Therefore, if there is an unexplained injury the child may be found to be an abused child under D.C. Official Code \u00a71602301(9)(A)(i). \"Failure to Protect\" is an important concept to understand. It is where the caregiver ha s failed to make reasonable efforts to prevent the infliction of abuse of the child, including for example, the filing of a petition for a civil protection order. Note: When determining whether a child is a neglected child due to abuse, the CPS worker mus t ensure that their decision is supported by the legal definition of abuse. If necessary, any concerns or questions can be discussed with your CPS management team or one of the OAG attorneys. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 46 Special Note : According to D.C. Official Code \u00a716 -2301(23)(B ), abuse does not include discipline administered to a child by a parent, guardian, or custodian provided that the discipline is reasonable in manner and moderate in degree and otherwise does not constitute cruelty. Case law indicates it must be more than transient pain and temporary marks . When determining abuse based on a caregiver's claim that he or she was disciplining the child, clinical judgment must be carefully applied. In accordance with the above section, discipline does not include any of the following acts: (i) Burning, biting, or cutting a child (ii) Striking a child with a closed fist (iii) Inflicting injury to a child by shaking, kicking, or throwing the child (iv) Non-accidental injury to a child under the age of 18 months (v) Interfering with a child's breathin g (vi) Threatening a child with a dangerous weapon or using such a weapon on a child The Code notes that the above listing is only illustrative of unacceptable acts of discipline and is not intended to be exclusive or exhaustive. In other words, clinical judgm ent shall be the determining factor when other types of acts are involved in the alleged discipline of a child. Other special note: The code defines \"physical injury\" as \"bodily harm, greater than transient pain or minor temporary mark.\" Clinical judgmen t as to whether the injury rises to this level must be used. TWO - The term \"neglected child\" means a child D.C. Official Code \u00a716 -2301(9)(A) ii ...who is without proper parental care or control, subsistence, education as required by law, or other care or control necessary for his or her physical, mental, or emotional health, and the deprivation is not due to the lack of financial means of his or her parent, guardian, or custodian. This Code section encompasses many types of neglect. Some examples are a d irty house, educational neglect, improper supervision, unmet medical or mental health needs of a child, inappropriate living environment, and ongoing exposure to domestic violence. These are only a few examples of what falls under this section of the Code. Note that in order to demonstrate neglect based on this definition, the neglect must be unrelated to financial means. Sources of income and public benefits must be assessed. Usually, if the parent is receiving some form of public benefits or could be rec eiving some form of public benefits, this requirement is not an issue. Also, if the neglect is unrelated to finances, this is not an issue. If the sole reason for the neglect is lack of money, the child may not fit this definition. That does not mean that the neglect would not fall under some other provision of the Code. If you have concerns regarding this, consult your management team. THREE - The term \"neglected child\" means a child D.C. Official Code \u00a716 -2301(9)(A) iii ...whose parent, guardian, or custod ian is unable to discharge his or her responsibilities to and for the child because of incarceration, hospitalization, or other physical or mental incapacity. This Code section clearly demonstrates that child neglect is a \"no fault\" process in that it doe s not look to the parent, guardian, or custodian to \"blame\" for their behavior, but looks instead to the child - and how the child is affected. This section applies to a child when a parent, guardian, or custodian is not able to care for the child due to b eing in jail, in the hospital, or having a physical or mental FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 47 incapacity. Substance abuse and the mental health of a parent will fit this definition only when that problem impacts the care of the child. The fact that a parent abuses drugs or has a mental h ealth issue does not alone equal neglect. Under this provision, it is essential to consider how the problem impacts the child. There must be a nexus (a connection) between the parent, guardian, or custodian's substance abuse and/or mental health and the c hild. It is also important to consider whether the parent with the problem made a plan for the care of the child. For example, if a parent is incarcerated or goes into drug treatment and plans for another parent, grandparent, or friend to care for the chil d, then there is likely no neglect. These situations must be considered on a case -by-case basis in conjunction with your supervisor. You should also consider the section of the IPOM that discusses Safety Planning. FOUR - The term \"neglected child\" means a child D.C. Official Code \u00a716 -2301(9)(A) iv ...whose parent, guardian, or custodian refuses or is unable to assume the responsibility for the child's care, control, or subsistence and the person or institution which is providing for the child states an intention to discontinue such care. This Code section is a two -prong test so both prongs must apply . The first part requires a parent, guardian, or custodian to refuse or be unable to assume care for the child. The second part is that the person or institutio n who is caring for the child states that they (the person or institution) will no longer care for the child. This situation often arises when a parent leaves a child with someone else, does not return for some period of time, and the caregiver becomes unw illing to continue to care for the child. In some cases, the \"unwilling caregiver\" might be a hospital that has a child ready for discharge but no parent is available to take the child home. FIVE - The term \"neglected child\" means a child D.C. Official Co de \u00a716 -2301(9)(A) v ...who is in imminent danger of being abused and another child living in the same household or under the care of the same parent, guardian, or custodian has been abused. This Code section applies when one child in a home has been abused and there are other children in the home determined by the social worker to be at serious risk. You must have one child who has been abused for this Code section to apply. You must also keep in mind that just because one child was abused does NOT automati cally mean that the other children in the home are in imminent danger. You must make an independent clinical assessment of every other child to determine risk. Remember to ensure that your decisions are supported by the legal definition of abuse or neglec t. You should look at factors such as age of the child, history of the family, severity of the abuse, special needs of the child, and whether the other children are similarly situated to the abused child. Reminder: If you have any questions, you may alwa ys seek legal advice from the OAG -OGC or the OAG -CPS. SIX - The term \"neglected child\" means a child D.C. Official Code \u00a716 -2301(9)(A) vi ...who has received negligent treatment or maltreatment from his or her parent, guardian, or custodian. This section g enerally applies when a child has not received doctor -recommended medical treatment or other serious neglect. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 48 SEVEN - The term \"neglected child\" means a child D.C. Official Code \u00a716 -2301(9)(A) vii ...who has resided in a hospital located in the District of Columbia for at least 10 calendar days after being born, despite a medical determination that the child is ready for discharge from the hospital, and the parent, guardian, or custodian of the child has not taken any action or made any effort to maintain a parental, guardianship, or custodial relationship or contact with the child. This applies to \"boarder baby\" cases. Current case law permits the newborn to not necessarily be ready for discharge for 10 days, but 10 days must have passed since the child's b irth and the child must be actually ready for discharge. Reminder: if necessary, seek legal advice from the CPS -OAG when encountering this scenario. EIGHT - The term \"neglected child\" means a child D.C. Official Code \u00a716 -2301(9)(A) viii ...who is born addi cted or dependent on a controlled substance or has a significant presence of a controlled substance in his or her system at birth. This section is used when a medical professional has determined that the child is born addicted or dependent on a controlled substance or has a significant presence of a controlled substance in his or her system at birth. Hospitals are required by law to call the Hotline when a child's system reveals the presence of a controlled substance. Seek legal guidance when necessary. Special Note: D.C. Official Code limits the judge (but not necessarily CFSA) from making a finding of neglect if the finding is \"based solely on a finding of the drugs in the child's system\". In order to do so, the judge must find that the child has been n egatively affected because of the drugs ( see D.C. Official Code \u00a716 -2317b ) or find that the child is a neglected child based on another D.C. Official Code section. NINE - The term \"neglected child\" means a child D.C. Official Code \u00a716 -2301(9)(A) ix ...in wh ose body there is a controlled substance as a direct and foreseeable consequence of the acts or omissions of the child's parent, guardian, or custodian. This section is used when a child has a drug in her system that was not prescribed to the child, and t he parent, guardian, or custodian could or should have prevented the child from ingesting the drug. TEN - The term \"neglected child\" means a child D.C. Official Code \u00a716 -2301(9)(A) x ...who is regularly exposed to illegal drug -related activity in the home . This Code section is used when a child is living in a home where illegal drug -related activity takes place (e.g., selling, purchasing, using, and manufacturing) and the child is a witness to the activity or is otherwise exposed to the activity. PAPERIN G A CASE If you have made a clinical determination that a child's safety is at risk and removal from the home is required, or if you are seeking the Family Court's intervention (and power) to assist the Agency in alleviating an allegation of neglect withou t necessarily removing a child, there are several mandatory FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 49 steps that you must take in order for the OAG to bring a case to the Court. These steps will lead to the start of a neglect court case. You must inform the OAG of the specific facts to support an allegation of neglect (i.e., one or more of the 10 Code sections listed above) before the OAG can file it with the Family Court. You must also state the general reason(s) CFSA believes the child to be a neglected child. The OAG will determine which of the Code sections is applicable to the clinical and factual reasons you give that the child is a neglected child. As the CPS investigative social worker, it is your responsibility to meet with the AAG to discuss, review, and sign the neglect petition. Please note that additional procedures regarding the management of removals are addressed in Chapter 10 of this guide. Please refer to this section for additional aspects of removal. Procedures for Removal Papering If you and your supervisor, in conjunction wit h one of the CPS program managers or program administrator, have concluded that a child must be removed for his or her safety, you must realize that the AAG has to be able to prove to the judge that there is probable cause* that the allegations in the petition are true. Without such a determination, the child (if removed) will have to be returned. (The case will still proceed in Family Court - but the child may remain in the home.) *For purposes of this POM, \"probable cause \" is a legal term meaning that th ere are sufficient facts for the Family Court to conclude that the allegations in the petition are true. If the Agency is unable to prove probable cause during the hearing, the child will not be able to be removed, or the child will have to be returned hom e immediately. S/he cannot remain out of the caregiver's custody. Under certain circumstances, you may not be clear as to whether to remove the child or not. In such cases, you should consult your supervisory chain. In non -removal cases, you should feel free to contact any AAG to make an appointment, or even just to \"walk in\" to discuss whether there is sufficient information to petition a case in Family Court. If you are on a scene where a child may be in immediate danger, you should first consult you r supervisor or management team prior to leaving the child in a potentially dangerous situation. This is critical! By leaving the child you may be inadvertently expressing that the child is safe, which can make a future removal more complicated to pursue i n Family Court. If a child is removed, you must immediately generate a complaint form as a first step in the process of protecting the child's safety and well -being. Complaint forms are accessible through the FACES.NET Referral Screen using the \"Court\" drop down box. Note: In the event that an on -going social worker initiates a complaint from an existing case, the complaint forms are also accessible through the FACES.NET Case Screen. In addition to all demographics, the completed complaint form shall justify the removal and include (at a minimum) the following information: Hotline report (excluding any identifying information on the reporter) FACES.NET search (excluding unfounded Agency history) Contact with the reporter (if it is possible to do so without identification as the reporter) Contact with parents, caregivers, alleged perpetrators Contact with all children and siblings Description of injuries, if applicable Contact with all collaterals, if applicable FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 50 Results of medical testing, if applicable and available Detective's information, if applicable Criminal history, if applicable Concluding paragraph summarizing the specific reasons for removal and any other information relevant to the child's safety and well -being Once the form is completed, you should submit it via FACES.NET to your management team for approval. Note: prior to your management team's approval, the form will carry a \"DRAFT\" watermark. Only after your management team has approved the form in FACES.NE T will the watermark disappear . Once your management team reviews and approves the form, you will submit the complaint electronically to the Family Court. You will need to print one copy for the hard record file and one for the family. Complaint forms r eceived by the OAG -CPS are distributed to the AAG who is scheduled to paper cases for that week. o You should contact the papering AAG on the day the complaint form is delivered to the Family Court and request a scheduled interview. o Once the interview is s cheduled, you must ensure your availability for the appointed time. If that does not happen, you should appear at the AAG's office at 8am the day of the initial hearing. o During the papering interview, you might feel as if the AAG is questioning some of you r clinical decisions. To the contrary, your clear and concise answers to their questions will help them present accurate information before the Family Court. It is the AAG's responsibility to turn your clinical decisions into legal decisions . o If the pape ring AAG notifies you of an intention not to paper the case, you must immediately notify your management team of the decision. OAG and CPS have agreed that \"no-paper\" decisions will involve management from both areas. What Legally Occurs after CFSA Takes Custody of a Child? (A) GAL is appointed within 24 hours (excluding Sundays) of the child being taken into custody. The GAL is an attorney who represents the best interests of the child , not just the child's wishes in general. For example, if the child wants to go home, the GAL must believe that this natural desire to return home is also in the best interest of the child's safety and well -being. The GAL will not necessarily advocate for the child's return merely based on the child's natural desire. (B) An initial hearing will take place within 72 hours (excluding Sundays) of the child being taken into custody. An initial hearing is a Family Court proceeding where the judge is asked to order the child into foster care. If the Court disagrees, the child must be retu rned home, even though both the Court's case and the case with CFSA remain open. (C) A petition must be filed by the AAG on behalf of CFSA (see \"Papering a Case\" above) at or prior to the shelter care hearing. During the 72 -hour period before appearing in Fam ily Court, CFSA may convene a formal Family Team Meeting (FTM) to develop a plan with the input of family members, relatives, and/or others FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 51 concerned with the welfare of the child. At a minimum, the FTM participants should include the birth parents, relati ves, caregivers, community representatives, service providers, and the GAL. Special Note: you are responsible for all Family Court -related activities prior to the transfer of the case to ongoing services. In addition, you are responsible for several spec ific matters that typically occur after case transfer. These include but are not limited to the following activities: o Participation in initial and further initial court proceedings o Participation in mediation o Participation in trial o Completion of complain t and mediation report o Completion of interim and disposition reports (if they are required during your case responsibility, but typically these are the responsibility of the ongoing social worker) All documentation must be entered into FACES.NET with ha rd copies submitted prior to the initial hearing, which is mandated to occur within 72 hours of removal. Special Note : Neither hearings nor complain filings occur on Sundays. See the Family Court schedule under Appendix III: CPS Logistical Information. Community Papering \"Community papering\" is the process that must be followed for the Family Court to intervene. Community papering is appropriate when CFSA (or one of CFSA's contracted agencies) has an open case with the family but there is no removal. If there has been a removal, community papering is not appropriate and the process for removal papering (i.e., 72 -hour papering) should be followed. In certain circumstances, usually when CFSA has established a consistent relationship with a family and the social worker determines that Family Court intervention is needed to ensure that the family complies with the recommendations of the Agency, CFSA will community paper a matter. Although the typical community papered case is not in CPS but instead is wit h an in -home ongoing social worker, there may be occasions for a CPS worker to community paper a matter. Community papering occurs every Friday (except holidays) with the OAG Child Protection attorneys. Social workers seeking to community paper a case s hould sign up for an appointment by either coming to the OAG suite at CFSA or by contacting their receptionist at 727 -3839, prior to Friday. There is a clipboard at the OAG Child Protection receptionist's desk detailing the availability for appointments. If you cannot meet with an AAG on a Friday, please let them know so another day can be given. When meeting with an AAG, bring a draft complaint form (it should not be filed with the Court) as well as any supporting documentation (e.g., school, medical or mental health records) that show that the family has not been complying with clinical recommendations as to maintain or improve a child's health, safety or well -being. This meeting, including the documentation, is to determine if the lack of compliance ris es to the level of legal neglect. (The complaint form should not yet be approved as the content of the complaint will be discussed, and possibly modified, after consultation with OAG.) Once an AAG decides to petition the case, the social worker can then co mplete the complaint process. The complaint form should detail the reason(s) for Agency involvement, the efforts made by the Agency to FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 52 address the neglect, and the reasons why those efforts have not succeeded in ameliorating the neglect. In short, why is t he social worker recommending Family Court involvement at this time? During the social worker's appointment, the AAG will read the complaint form (note that a complaint form is not necessary and the community papering interview can proceed without one). The purpose of the papering interview is to ascertain more information to determine whether or not a legal basis exists to file a petition with the Court. Additionally, the AAG may inquire why a removal has not occurred, if it appears that there is a safe ty or risk issue. Removal decisions, however, are clinical decisions and the social worker should have already discussed that with his/her supervisor or program manager in advance of the meeting with the AAG. If the AAG determines that a legal basis exist s for filing a petition, the AAG will instruct the social worker to prepare a complaint form. The AAG will review the complaint form prior to filing and the social worker will be instructed to keep the complaint in draft form until the petition is complet ed. Once the petition is ready, the social worker will be notified to electronically file the complaint form. Once the complaint form is submitted, the petition will be e -filed. The AAG will notify the social worker of the date and time for the initial hearing and the social worker must then notify the caregiver(s). Initial hearings occur within 5 days of the filing of the petition, so the social worker and AAG should discuss availability of both the social worker and the parent(s). If the AAG determi nes that a legal basis to paper the case does not exist, the AAG will complete the community papering \"no -paper\" form, obtain his or her section chief's signature, and then provide the form to the social worker. Note there are 4 choices for the AAG: no pap er with reasons; insufficient information with reasons; submit complaint referral and schedule an appointment with the social worker to petition the case; or consultation only. If the AAG determines that a legal basis exists but supporting documentation i s needed prior to going forward, the AAG will delineate the type of information needed. The social worker should gather that information and provide it to the same AAG within 5 days of the meeting. If longer time is needed, the social worker should schedul e an appointment with the original AAG after the information is obtained. OAG and CPS have agreed that \"no-paper\" decisions will involve both CPS and OAG management. Examples of cases that are likely more appropriate for community papering include educati onal neglect, medical neglect where emergency care is not needed (that day), or cases where the caregiver has a substance abuse or mental health issue that is impacting parenting but imminent danger to the child(ren) does not exist. Pre-Petition Custody O rder In the event that you are unable to locate a child who is involved in your investigation, and you've determined that the child is, or may be, in immediate danger from his or her surroundings, or you have established reasonable grounds to believe that the child is suffering from an illness or injury or is otherwise endangered such that removal from the child's surroundings is necessary, then you must complete both an affidavit and a request for a Pre -Petition Custody Order . The affidavit and request fo r custody order forms are templates that you can request from your management team. Contact an OAG section chief for review and determination of whether the custody order can be filed. The section chief can also provide advice regarding completion of for ms, if necessary. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 53 The following information is included in the completed affidavit and request for custody order: Respondent's name (i.e., the child's name) Respondent's date of Respondent's alias, if any Respondent's address Respondent's des cription (gender, race, height, weight, scars or distinguishing marks, youth division number, child's case number, MPD identification number) Nature of the complaint (i.e., description of allegations and detailed grounds for removal) Your name and title Your signature (in the presence of the AAG who will swear you to the information) If the AAG determines that all facts meet the legal standard for obtaining a custody order, the AAG will sign off on the custody order and direct you to take the documents to the Central Intake Center at 500 Indiana Avenue, NW. You should wait for the custody order to be issued there. Once you receive the official custody order, please make sure you document the information in FACES.NET as well as file the hard copy in the case record. INITIAL HEARING If a child has been removed from the home, or CFSA is requesting that a child be removed from the home, the parent has the right to a probable cause hearing . Be prepared! You will testify at this hearing. Do not be nervo us; simply answer truthfully the questions that are asked of you. You are allowed to testify what you have learned through \"hearsay\" , i.e., what another person has told you. For example, if you receive information from a doctor, you may simply state what t he doctor said to you. This is different than at the trial phase where the doctor would have to give direct testimony. A probable cause hearing is held to determine whether there is credible reason to believe that the allegations in the petition are tru e. This is separate and apart from a shelter care hearing which is held to determine whether the child or children should remain in CFSA custody. These two hearings are generally combined for expedience. The AAG will prepare you for this hearing during th e \"papering\" meeting and again before the hearing itself. At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge shall make one of two decisions: (A) An order for shelter care, setting forth in writing his or her reasons for why the child's shelter care is required (B) An order for the child to be released, if shelter care is not required under such criteria If a child is ordered released, the judge may impose one or more of the following conditions: (A) Placement of the child in the custody of a parent, guardian, or custo dian, or under supervision of a person or organization agreeing to supervise the child or youth FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 54 (B) Placement of restrictions on the child's travel, activities, or place of abode during the period of release You should be prepared to suggest services for the child and for the family to reduce the risk of further abuse or neglect. You should also prepare a proposed visitation schedule (with conditions, if necessary) before the hearing. It is important to include sibling visitation and how it will occur. If the child is to remain at home, be prepared to suggest conditions for the Family Court to order the parent, guardian, or custodian to follow in order to ensure child safety. You should work expeditiously to get emergency licensing information to interested rel atives. When removal is necessary, the Agency will always require that a child is placed with a licensed foster parent. This includes placement with a relative. Consult your management team and CFSA policy on how to request emergency licensing information but remember: the government will always object to a placement if the emergency license has not yet been granted. Keep in mind that CFSA depends upon Title IV -E funding for the life a case. This funding is contingent to the Family Court's findings. Your testimony to the Family Court must support either one of the following two findings in order for Title IV -E funding to be approved: (1) Reasonable efforts were made by the Agency to prevent removal of the child. (2) The risk of harm to the child was so serious that the failure of the Agency to make reasonable efforts was a proper choice under the circumstances. REMINDER: A percentage of the Title IV -E money spent by CFSA may be reimbursed by the federal government if proper documentation is maintaine d both in FACES.NET and in the hard copy of a case record. IF IT'S NOT IN FACES.NET, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN! Initial Hearings - Schedule For initial hearings being scheduled from Monday through Friday, Family Court begins at 11am. To ensure timely attendance, C FSA notifies parents to appear at 10am . This allows sufficient opportunity for parents to go to the Center for Child Abuse and Neglect (CCAN), to participate in an eligibility interview, and to meet with their attorneys. There is on e magistrate judge ass igned to initial hearings each week. You must notify the parent of the date and time of the hearing at the time of the child's removal. For Saturday and holidays , there is one AAG papering. Court is held at 10am on the JM level of DC Superior Court in Roo m JM -15. A schedule for these times is kept on the desk of the OAG receptionist with the name of the AAG papering for each division and for Saturdays. CFSA CUSTODY OF THE CHILD Pursuant to D.C. Official Code \u00a716 -2313, CFSA has the legal authority to place a child in any one of the following appropriate foster care options: (1) A family -based or therapeutic foster home (2) A group home, youth shelter, or other appropriate facility for non -delinquent children (3) A facility for specialized shelter care designated by CF SA's Placement Services Administration, including any other appropriate facility operated by the District of Columbia FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 55 Special Considerations Visitation D.C. Official Code \u00a716 -2310(d) requires weekly (at a minimum) visitation by a child's parent, guardia n, or custodian when the child has been placed in shelter care, unless it appears to the judge that such visitation rights would create an imminent danger to or be detrimental to the well -being of the child. In which case, the judge either establishes spec ial conditions for visitation or orders that visitation rights not be allowed. Orders for Physical and Mental Examinations Once the AAG has filed the neglect petition, a Family Court order may require a child to be examined in order to determine his or he r physical or mental condition. D.C. Official Code \u00a716 -2315 permits physical and mental examinations of a child. Orders might also be given for mental health examinations of a parent, guardian, or custodian. You should discuss the need for such examination s with your management team as well as with the AAG, either before, during, or shortly after the papering session. General Legal Considerations As is the case with each procedural step involving a child's entry into care, all relevant facts and informati on must be entered accurately into FACES.NET. The importance of accurate documentation in FACES.NET cannot be underestimated! Not only does it protect the rights of the child, accurate documentation protects the integrity of data that the Agency must main tain in the event of local and federal reviews and audits. All documentation must be entered into FACES.NET and hard copies submitted prior to the initial court hearing. Reminder: initial court hearings are mandated to occur within 72 hours of removal . HOLDS Administrative Hold - Although not a legal term, \"administrative holds\" are included in your FACES.NET documentation. A child who is removed is under an \"administrative hold\" until the matter is taken into Family Court and the child is either returned to the caregiver or a shelter care order is implemented. You are not able to put any type of hold on a child without completing a complaint form because the hold, in effect, \"removes\" the child. When you are removing a child who is not yet physically able to go to a placement (such as a hospitalized child) this is called a \"constructive removal.\" 5-day hold - When a complaint has been filed after the removal of a child, OAG may request that the Family Court permit up to 5 additional days for CFSA to conti nue the investigation before returning to Family Court for the initial hearing, at which time a petition must be filed, or the child can no longer remain in care. If the Court finds that there is \"good cause\", OAG will be granted the \"5 -day hold\" but again , by the end of those 5 days, OAG must file a petition for neglect or return the child home. The parent or legal caregiver still has a right to request a shelter care hearing to determine whether the child should remain in CFSA custody during this time. 90-day hold - This term is actually out of date. It was formerly used to describe the 90 -day period of time that CFSA permitted parents, guardians, or custodians to voluntarily place their child into CFSA care. CFSA no longer utilizes this process. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 56 Unacco mpanied Refugee Minors This is a legal term used to describe children who have been brought to the United States from another county and who come into the care of CFSA based on federal law. In general, CFSA is not involved and such cases do not start with an allegation or a report to the 24 -hour Hotline system. The term is used when the U.S. Department of State identifies refugee children overseas who are eligible for resettlement in the U.S. but do not have a parent or a relative available, and the U.S. is committed to providing for their long term care. Upon arrival in the U.S., these refugee children are placed into the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors (URM) program to receive refugee foster care services and benefits. The URM Program helps these children and youth develop appropriate skills to enter adulthood and to achieve social self -sufficiency. If you have a case involving a minor alleged to be an \"unaccompanied minor\", contact your program administrator and the OAG. DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY The Distric t of Columbia is uniquely situated as both a residential area and the nation's capital city where foreign dignitaries hold resident in an embassy or consulate representing their native countries. Accordingly, there may be times when a Hotline report involv es someone who has diplomatic immunity. This may be the parent, guardian, or custodian of the child, or often the child him/herself. Children of parents, guardians, or custodians who have diplomatic immunity most likely also have immunity and therefore th e family is not subject to federal or local laws . The moment you have cause to reasonably suspect that the parent, guardian, or custodian is a diplomat, or that the child has diplomatic immunity , your investigation must cease until further instructions are given by the OAG - OGC. In collaboration with the U.S. Department of State, the OAG -OGC will determine whether in fact a diplomat is the subject of a neglect investigation. Special Note: Not all non -citizens claiming to have diplomatic immunity actually have diplomatic immunity. Regardless, if it comes to your attention that the life of a child is at risk, you are obligated to act appropriately to immediately protect the child. Contact your management team immediately, and the OAG -OGC for further instruc tions. Currently to contact the OAG -OGC in non -emergency diplomatic immunity matters, send an email to paul.kratchman@dc.gov with a copy to wendy.singleton@dc.gov and list the referral number, the reason you believe a family member or members have immunity and the extent of CPS' investigation prior to stopping. Usually within 2 business days the OAG -OGC will inform you that in fact, the family has immunity or that there is no immunity. If no immunity, proceed as normal. If immunity the OAG -OGC will send a letter to the U.S. State Department seeking authorization to proceed with an investigation. The letter will have a date by which CFSA will close its matter if i t does not hear from the U.S. State Department. That letter will be sent to you and should be documented in FACES by copying and pasting the text of the letter into FACES. The matter should be closed as \"incomplete - diplomatic immunity\" in FACES once th at period of time has elapsed. You must also have held a consultation with your program manager in reference to this matter with this consult also being documented into FACES. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 57 THE CPS INVESTIGATION FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 58 THE CPS INVESTIGATION All CPS r eports are screened by Hotline workers who utilize clinical judgment and a standardized \"decision tree\" in FACES.NET to determine whether or not an investigation is warranted. Based on this FACES .NET determination, the Hotline worker will document a respon se time that tells the CPS investigative social worker whether to make an initial face -to-face contact with the child victim within 2 hours (\"immediate response time \") or within 24 hours (\"regular response time\") . The Hotline worker will then submit the re ferral to the assigned Hotline supervisor for approval. If approved, the Hotline supervisor will forward the referral to the CPS supervisor who shall assign the referral to an investigative social worker. INITIAL FAMILY BACKGROUND RESEARCH When an immed iate response time is assigned, the investigative social worker or the management team must still follow certain pre -investigation steps whenever possible prior to initial contact, or as soon as possible after the initial contact with the child victim. This includes contact with the reporter is possible, and a review of all available information or records on the child and family to help you prepare for the investigation. You should gather the following information: Additional demographic information on a family History of, or a pattern of, abuse or neglect Child and family support systems and protective capacity Specialized needs of the children or caregivers Possible safety threats Any possible worker safety issues There are a number of things you will want to look for and think about the minute you receive a new referral . You must first thoroughly review the referral snapshot , recognizing that it is not typically or necessarily reflective of all family members or prior involvement with the Agency. Due to this reason, you will want always to conduct a thorough search for each referral that you receive. Several resources are available : FACES.NET Search The Automated Client Eligibility Determination System (ACEDS) The Student Transmittal and Attendan ce Record System (STARS) FACES.NET Search for Prior CFSA History Thorough review of prior referrals and case history can be very useful in assessing chronic problems as well as strengths within the family. It can also reveal risk elements and prepare you for the home visit, in addition to assisting you with assessing child safety. You should consider the family's prior involvement with CFSA throughout your assessment of the family . FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 59 ACEDS - Automated Client Eligibility Determination System Many families who come to the attention of the District's child welfare system are recipients of public assistance from the District's Income Maintenance Administration (IMA). Such assistance may come in the form of food stamps, medical assistance benefits, and Temporar y Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Information on all recipients is entered into t he ACEDS database , which can be access ed by CPS investigative social workers seeking background information and family history . Please see your CPS management team for a dditional information on reading an ACEDS report. o At the very beginning of your investigation activities, it is especially useful to search ACEDS for information regarding additional siblings and other household members. o Keep in mind that the ACEDS datab ase is shut down by 8 pm on weekdays and only has sporadic accessibility during the weekend. o The ACEDS system is searched by NAME ONLY, not by address. If you have only an address and not a family name, ACEDS will not provide information on the family. NOTE: Families receiving assistance from IMA often fail to update their demographic information in a timely fashion. As a result, such information in the ACEDS system may not always be current. The IMPORTANCE of Reviewing PRIOR HISTORY Why know history ? o It is cr itical to assess the new allegations in the context of all previous reports and allegations. o Families may not openly reveal critical elements of their situation that would be helpful in your assessments, including the following information: (a) Other childre n in the home or other children who may reside outside of the home (b) Persons who are /were not allowed contact with the family through a protection order or visitation order Knowledge of prior history can reveal important facts : o Whether the current alleged c hild victim is the same as in prior reports o The number of prior substantiated , inconclusive , or unfounded reports o Severity and type of current allegations compared to those in prior reports o Results of previous safety interventions and services o Written fin dings of staff who previously worked with the family o Possible locations or living situations for families Consider the following: o What is c hild's present condition, family functioning , and household conditions as compared to prior repo rts? o What do the pat terns or frequency of past reports tell us? o What is t he source of prior reports ? Are there multiple reports with similar allegations called in by the same or different reporters? FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 60 STARS - Student Transmittal and Attendance Record System The STARS database tracks attendance records for students currently enrolled in DC Public Schools . At times, the database will also includ e some historical attendance records. Transcripts and class schedules are typically available for high school students. F or grades K-8, progress reports must be obtained directly from the school of attendance. Unlike ACEDS, the STARS database does have the capability for \"reverse searches\", i.e., the CPS investigative social worker can search for a family or child using only an address. As a result, STARS is a useful and complementary tool for locating and identifying a family when no other demographic information is available . o The STARS database is generally accessible 24 hours a day. o STARS information separates partial absences from class versus full absences for an entire day or more . This applies for both middle and high school student attendance reports. Note: Absences recorded in the database do not necessarily re flect whether the absence was excused or not. o Keep in mind that attendance information may not always be accurate. When utilizing this information to substantiate a neglect allegation, you should definitely have a conversation with the school official for confirmation. Be sure to carefully documen t this infor mation in your investigation notes. o Pulling the student information card may also have helpful information, such as the address listed for the family, the names of caregivers, and emergency contact information . PRE-INVESTIGATION CONSULTATIONS Contacting the Reporting Source You are required to immediately contact the source of the report to obtain further clarification and information about the allegations. The reporting source is one of your core contacts. This initial contact may also lead to other pers ons who can provide information as to whether safety factors are present that may place the child in immediate danger or impending danger of harm. If the source is not immediate ly available, continue to contact the source until you are able to make contact . Be prepared to explain to all reporting sources that the investigation is confidential and that you cannot share information without the proper releases. This can be difficult for individuals who are genuinely concerned about children so acknowledge t his when you speak with the reporting source. Remember that individuals who report may not have the first -hand information about which they are reporting. You must then also reach out the original reporting source to clarify the allegations and any other investigation concerns. For example, a reporting source may share information that they have received second hand from another family member, professional, or concerned citizen. Without revealing the reporting source, you should make efforts to confer wi th the person who ha s direct information about the allegations. Contacting the Ongoing Social Worker When an investigation is received on an open case, the Hotline worker will notify both the ongoing social worker and the management team. With this in min d, you should communicate with the ongoing social worker prior to initiating the investigation. He or she will be able to provide you with key information about a family's functioning that will support your investigation and assessment activities. Whenever possible, you should jointly assess the allegations with the ongoing social worker, even though you will still be taking the lead due to the specialty of your investigation skill set. If you FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 61 are not able to quickly make contact with the ongoing team, this must not delay the initiation of your investigation. Contacting the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) All reports involving allegations of child physical abuse and sexual abuse are forward ed to the MPD Youth Investigations Division (YID ). From that p oint onward , an assessment is made by MPD and the United States Attorney's Office as to whether the report meets the criteria for a criminal investigation. If your investigation requires an immediate response, or what MPD might classify as a \"hot case\" (serious physical or sexual abuse), contact must be made with YI D which will determine whether the investigation should be assigned immediately to them. Contact should be made at the main number (202/576 -6768) with the detective or sergeant on duty who is a ssigning cases that day. If your investigation is not assigned immediately at YI D, but is determined to warrant a criminal investigation, it will be assigned according to a timeframe determined by YID. When assignments are made, YI D notifies the CPS special abuse supervisor along with other points of contact in the administration , generally a few times a week . A point of contact in CPS in turn distributes this information via e-mail to the assigned investigator and supervisor. If a report does not meet t he criteria for a criminal investigation it will be turned over to (TOT) CFSA. Information regarding TOT investigations is also sent to the CPS special abuse supervisor, generally on a weekly basis . Again, the supervisor distributes this information via e-mail to the assigned investigator and supervisor. Note : The acronym TOT is frequently used by MPD . As an investigative social worker, it is beneficial for you to be familiar with the acronym in case MPD uses it to identify the investigations that are turn ed over to CFSA. If you have not received communication from MPD regarding your investigation within 7 business days, please consult with your supervisor prior to contacting YID directly . Your supervisor will advise whether or not to contact MPD via telep hone or e-mail to request information on the assigned detective or to determine whether the referral has been TOT 'd to CFSA. It should be noted that physical or sexual abuse reports that resulted in an arrest being made by a District officer (as opposed to an in vestigator or detective from YID ) are not assigned to YID because the matter is considered to be closed with the arrest. In the event that you are involved in a child fatality investigation , you will still likely have contact with YID. The lead in these investigations is the MPD Special Victims Unit (SVU). Please refer to the child fatality section of this guide for additional detail s. NOTE: There will be times when you are the first MDT professional to assess allegations of physical or sexual abus e. In the event that the originally reported concern is found to be different or more serious than originally reported, you are required to contact YID to update them with this new information. CPS INTERVIEWS General Guidelines The Agency is mandated to conduct a thorough investigation into reports of suspected abuse or neglect to protect the health and safety of the children involved. The CPS interview is a fundamental component of this mandate. Ideally, the interviews with children will take place at a neutral setting like the child's school. Interviews with caregivers are likely to occur at home but may occur in other environments (schools, hospitals, etc.). Either way, you must make a home visit. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 62 Remember also that the information you get from one int erview will likely be used to gather information from the next. To maintain the integrity of all gathered information, each person should be interviewed separately, typically starting with the alleged victim and other children. At times you will want to ga in information from collateral sources of information (emergency physicians, teachers who witnessed alleged abuse, etc.) . The resources will have direct information on the facts of the assessment that will be needed when conducting the family interviews. T he following interviews will be discussed in this section : Alleged victim and other children Non-offending caregivers Alleged perpetrator Other household members Collaterals FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 63 GUIDELINES FOR INTER VIEWING CHILDREN According to D.C. Official Code \u00a74-1301.04(c)(3)(A), CFSA must interview children without the presence of their care taker(s) in order to protect the health and safety of children . The initial phase of the investigation shall include: ... seeing the child and all other children in the househol d outside of the presence of the caretaker or care takers . REMINDER: You are required to interview and assess ALL children in the home. Each child should be afforded the opportunity to share individual accounts and explanations of the allegations on the referral. If a child is too young to be interviewed, he or she must be observed awake , and be assessed in reference to the caregiver or parent. ( See the Required Tasks for Interviewing Children below. ) You must ensure that all of the children involved with t he family have been interviewed , including children living outside of the home, e.g., in another residence or in another state. You must note the time, date, and place of each interview, and you must enter this information in FACES.NET . REQUIRED TASKS FO R INTERVIEWING CHILDREN Required Task Assess - Describe - Document Assess the physical appearance of the child. Observe the child. Take a photograph of the child (when applicable or appropriate). Determine if the child's clothing is appropriate for siz e and weather conditions. Determine if the child is appropriately groomed (cleanliness, hair, odor, and so forth). Assess whether the child has any physical injuries. Determine if the child needs immediate medical care. Determine if the child has any physical injur ies. Photograph any injuries . Describe the size, shape, type , and location of the injury.

Child's ability and desire to engage in conversation. Any obvious challenging behavioral issues. Any behavior or attitude that appears developmentally out of the norm. Any known or suspected special needs. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 64 Discuss the interview ing ground rules directly with the child. The following informa tion must be documented to attest to the child's legitimate participation in the interviewing process: Is the child aware of the difference between the truth and lying, and has the child agree d to tell the truth? Can the child state when s/he does or does not understand a question, and does the child agree to ask any questions when s/he does not understand? Does the child agree not to guess if they don't know an answer? Has the child agreed to correct you if you say things that are incorrect? Family and h ousehold composition Describe the members of the child's household and their relationship to the child. Note whether there is more than one household involved. Describe other significant persons in the child's life (extended family, godparents, other mean ingful caregivers, etc.) Specifically discuss the child's biological parents a nd grandparents or other meaningful caregivers, even if they are currently absent from the child's life . Family relationships Describe the child's perception of each member of the household. Assess specifically whether the primary caregiver has a significant other (who may or may not live in the home). Assess for any domestic violence in the family ( see section on Domestic Violence , p. 78 of this POM ). Family rules and respons ibilities Discuss the following topics: Any rules that exist in the household (Do not presume that there are rules. ) Responsibilities of different household members for chores, cooking, supervision, etc. Family discipline practices Discuss and document responses to the following questions: How is rule -breaking handled in the family? What happens if or when the children \"get into trouble\"? Who is the primary disciplinarian in the family? Is physical discipline used? Discuss type of object used, where the child is hit, how many times the child is hit, and how frequent ly it occurs in the family. Are there any differences in discipline used between siblings or with other children in the household?

General safety Discuss safety in general with the child and what it means to be safe, including any safety factors that the child may share. Any additional information regarding the allegations not discussed above What, when, where, how? Who was present? Try to elicit e xplanations of the incident and each allegation . How does the caregiver or maltreater feel about and react to the incident and allegations? FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 66 Special Guidelines for Observing Child In juries (Normally Clothed Areas) When allegations include an injury (or injuries) on those parts of the body that are normally covered by clothing, you must consider how best to visually observe the injuries. Depending upon the allegations (or any additiona l information you've received during the course of your investigation), you may wish to consult with your management team to determine what action is necessary for you to reach a conclusion regarding the child's immediate safety. When visual inspection is deemed appropriate, it is generally considered good practice to seek the parents' or caregivers' consent. You should use discretion , however, when deciding whether to examine the child in the presence of the caregiver. Under certain circumstances, it may not be in the child's best interest to request consent or to inspect a child in the caregiver's presence. The following examples are not exhaustive but, i n general, these are situations where it is likely not appropriate to seek the caregiver's consent or to examine the child in the caregiver's presence: At the onset of a joint investigation with the YID detective When there are concerns that a caregiver may impact the outcome of the investigation by coaching other children or collaterals When the child's safety is at risk, or other children's safety is at risk When a caregiver is a possible flight risk When the location of all children has not been ascertained When the caregiver is a threat to the well -being of the social worker The following examples ar e situations where it is likely to be appropriate to seek consent and to examine the child in the presence of the caregiver: To rule out physical abuse by documenting a lack of marks or injuries When observing accidental injuries If the caregiver present i s the non -offending caregiver Minor physical injury After a joint investigation has commenced and in consultation with the YID detective Minimizing Impact on the Child during Visual Observations To minimize the potential for negative impact on the child, you should consider the following factors: Always conduct the visual observation in a place that supports the child's privacy and dignity . If possible, use a medical professional's office space, e.g., a school nurse's office. Always ensure that more than one person is present, preferably a caregiver or a professional (e.g., social worker, school nurse, or pediatrician) . If the child is age 4 or over, one of the persons present must be of the same gender. Carefully explain to the child, using simple lang uage, exactly what is happening and why. Reinforce the nature of the inspection as being conducted for the child's safety. Clarify with the child his or her right to personal boundaries, if age appropriate. Whenever possible, present the child with an op tion for a professional to perform the visual inspection. Be sure that the child expresses comfort with the decision. If the child is not comfortable with the procedure, be sure to make every effort to allay any fears. Do not force the inspection! If the caregiver is present, and the child is unable to undress him/herself, ask the caregiver to undress the child. If the caregiver is not present, someone familiar to the child should assist. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 67 You must record in your case notes , a written description of each photograph as well as a written description of any observed injuries, including size, location on the body, shape and configuration. Any photographs taken must be printed and placed into the hard file record. The photograph should be electronically stor ed in the file cabinet. If the injuries are severe, or potentially serious, or if medical attention is needed, the child should be seen by a physician immediately. The results of the examination should be thoroughly documented. GUIDELINES FOR INTER VIEWING CAREGIVERS RESIDING IN THE HOME As with all interviews, you are responsible for conducting a comprehensive assessment of the immediate safety and risk of future harm for each child in the family, including but not limited to the direct allegations in the Hotline report. Although this section specifies tasks for interviewing the non -offending parents or caregivers residing in the home, the basic tasks are the same for interviewing the alleged maltreater. You should follow the required tasks for both parties, particularly because the maltreaters are frequently the primary caregiver. If the maltreator is not a primary caregiver (such as an absent or infrequent parent), consideration may be given to aspects of the caregiver interview that are not applica ble. Note that it is the CPS practice to only conduct the initial discussion of investigation allegations in person (not via telephone). Further , you should note that it is the expected practice to use appropriate investigative techniques when addressing allegations. This includes conducting an open -ended assessment. In most instances, it is inappropriate for social workers to immediately disclose the specific allegations in the investigation. For example, a social worker may be assigned to investigate an allegation of \"abuse -hitting\" but s/he would begin the assessment with a caregiver by discussing \"concerns for child well-being or safety\" (as opposed to concerns of \"physical abuse\" ). Similarly, a social worker would not immediately narrow the discussion to a specific abusive incident without first exploring the global issues of discipline and violence in a family. These are investigative techniques that are taught in pre -service and reinforced during ongoing training . They are also modeled by CPS manag ement. REQUIRED TASKS FOR INTERVIEWING CAREGIVERS RESIDING IN THE HOME Required Task Assess - Describe - Document Conduct a f ace-to-face interview with parents or caregivers .

Any additional information regarding the allegations not discussed above Discuss the n on-offending caregiver's account [or alleged maltreater's account] of each allegation: What, when, where, how Who was present ? Explanations of the incident and each allegation How does the caregiver or maltreater fe el about and react to the incident and/or allegations? FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 70 THE HOME VISIT Even if you do not interview in the home, you must still make a home visit and conduct a thorough assessment of the immediate living environment. This assessment will help you to d etermine whether there are any unsafe conditions that place the child in immediate or imminent danger. ASSESSING THE HOME Required Task Assess - Describe - Document Visit and assess the home environment for the presence of safety factors. Document whet her any of those factors pose immediate danger or imminent danger for the children. All family living areas must be examined. Living area means any area of a home or residence that is utilized by a family , includ ing the basement, garage, attic, etc. Determine sleeping arrangements for all household members. Ensure that all infants have their own cribs ( see dangers of co -sleeping below ). Do any of these potentially unsafe conditions exist in the home? No heat/hot water Unsafe space heater or other heating methods No gas No electricity Unsafe lighting (e.g., candles) No window guards Non-working smoke alarm Inadequate plumbing Inadequate food supply Inadequate or lack of sleeping arrangements (e. g., no bed or crib) Unsanitary conditions (e.g., presence of vermin ) Exposed wires Broken taps, or taps running scalding water Leaking gas Broken windows or door locks Exposed radiator or exposed pipes No phone or disconnected phone Toxic chemicals or harmful medications in easy reach of the child FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 71 GUIDELINES FOR INTERVIEWING OTHER HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS You must interview ALL household members not just the parents or primary caregivers residing in the home. Establish and document all relationships in the home. Required Task Assess - Describe - Document Relationshi p of household members Determine the nature of the relationships between the household members (length of time known, length of time sharing the residence, etc.). Knowledge of the household members regarding the allegations Discussion should be held with the household members regarding any knowledge of the allegations. Determine whether the household members have other knowledge regarding the safety and well-being of the children in the home. Discussion should be held with the household members regarding the general safety and well -being of the children in the home. Specifically discuss supervision and discipline methods within the household. Educate all household members on DC regulations regarding child abuse and neglect. Assess the state of the househ old as it relates to all household members. Determine whether there is appropriate living space for all household members . (E.g., are family members sleeping on the floor or sharing beds ?) Determine whether there is sufficient food and clothing for all hou sehold members. Determine whether all household members have safe sleeping arrangements (e.g., cribs with safety bars ). GUIDELINES FOR INTERVIEWING COLLATERAL CONTACTS Collateral contacts are sources of information that are knowledgeable about the client 's situation and serve to support or corroborate information. Collateral contacts also include mandated reporters , such as teachers and medical personnel, as well as other people in the community who may be relevant to the investigation. Remember to famili arize yourself with Agency standards on confidentiality when conducting collateral interviews. Collateral contacts often provide a good deal of information that is helpful in determining the disposition ( see p. 143 for information on the disposition decis ion). These interviews help you obtain additional information about the children and family that will help determine whether or not the children are in immediate danger or if there is risk for future maltreatment. Key information to gather from collater al contacts includes ... How long each collateral has known the child and family Collateral's assessment of the child's condition Collateral's assessment of family functioning, including their knowledge of any safety factors or risk elements that may be opera ting in the family Collateral's knowledge of the allegations, and any other signs of abuse or maltreatment FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 72 All interviews with collateral contacts must be documented . Every CPS investigation require s the following minimum standard s for obtaining informat ion from collateral sources prior to the investigation's closure: You must make at least one attempt to obtain detailed information from medical providers, daycare providers, and educational providers. If this information is not pertinent to the dispositio n, the investigation may be closed without it after discussion with your management team. At a minimum, you must obtain the most recent available information on the child's immunizations and school attendance records if school age, both of which help to e stablish at least a minimal level of medical and educational care. You are required to attempt to obtain collateral information within one week of gaining knowledge of the identity of the collateral sources of information. You must not wait until the end of the investigation to request information from collateral sources. REQUIRED TASKS FOR INTERVIEWING MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS Required Task Assess - Describe - Document Immunizations Request immunization records from a credible source (e.g., child's school and medical provider, CFSA's Clinical Health Services Administration , and the DC Department of Health). Review the immunization records to determine if the child is current, due, or overdue for immunizations. If the record indicates that the child is o verdue for immunizations by one month or more, the worker should confirm any discrepancies with the medical provider or another credible source of information. Note: the Department of Health does not update the system on a monthly basis. If the caregiver h as indicated that they have chosen to withhold immunizations, you should confirm that the appropriate paperwork has been submitted to the school, e.g., the caregiver has opted out for philosophical or religious reasons. Note: documentation of this sort mus t be annually updated. Special Note: it is not against the law to withhold immunizations from a child, nor is it automatically considered medical neglect. Regular and preventive medical care Request information from the medical provider ( e.g., records or verbal confirmation). Request information regarding the caregiver's compliance with appointments, recommendations, and follow -up appointments. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 73 Medical conditions or prescribed medication Request information from the caregiver regarding any outstandi ng medical issues or any medications that have been prescribed for the child.

Concerns of abuse or neglect Determine whether the medical provider has any concerns of abuse or neglect . REQUIRED TASKS FOR INTERVIEWING EDUCATIONAL PERSONNEL Required Task Assess - Describe - Document Child's attendance records Request records from the school. Determine and document the following information: More than 10 unexcused absences in any given school yea r School policy on absences versus tardiness Whether absences are due to the child's truancy (despite caregiver's efforts) or educational neglect Notification to caregiver by the school with regard to the child's absences Whether the school has discussed t he attendance issue with the caregiver School compliance with the appropriate steps outlined in CFSA's Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with DC Public Schools (regarding truancy and educational neglect ) Filing of a DC Superior Court Truancy Referral Form to initiate court action Caregiver compliance with school recommendations Academic p erformance Obtain report cards or verbal reports from teachers or school staff regarding the child's academic performance. Determine if poor academic performance is rela ted to tardiness or excessive absences. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 74 Special educational needs Determine and document the following information: Existence of a current individual education plan (IEP) Participation of caregiver in development of IEP (if relevant) Caregiver compliance with school recommendations for ameliorating any behavioral or academic concerns Whether caregiver is addressing behavioral issues through therapy or medication , e.g., medication for attention -deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) School adherence to IEP recommendations Note: Caregivers are not mandated to use medication therapy for behavioral concerns . Determine if the child requires additional testing (if applicable ). Determine if the caregiver has complied with any recommendations for testing: Hearin g Vision Developmental Evaluation Caregiver involvement or actions Determine if the caregiver attends teacher conferences, IEP meetings, suspension meetings, or meetings regarding the child's attendance.

Determine whether the child appears in good health or is brought to the daycare provider when ill. Inquire about any history of unexplained or suspicious injuries. Determine if there are additional concern s of abuse or neglect. Specifically discuss with staff whether they have had concerns regarding abuse or neglect of the child. REQUIRED TASKS FOR INTERVIEWING MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS Required Task Assess - Describe - Document Mental health or behavi oral issues for the child If the caregiver or school indicates that the child has any behavioral issues, e.g., suicidal or homicidal ideations, sexualized behavior (outside of age appropriate exploration), or other indicators of mental health issues, deter mine if the child has been referred for or received the appropriate evaluation or assessment. Request information regarding the outcome of the assessment or evaluation, including any recommendations. Determine whether or not the parent or caregiver has fol lowed through with the recommendations or referred services. Medication prescribed for child's mental health issues Request information from the mental health provider regarding any prescriptions. Request information regarding the caregiver's compliance with appointments, recommendations, and medication regimes. If the caregiver has chose n not to medicate the child, what other services is the caregiver utilizing to address the child's behavior? NOTE: It is not neglectful for a caregiver to refuse to giv e their child medication for a behavioral issue IF the issue is being addressed through another therapeutic intervention . FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 76 Determine if the caregiver is exhibiting any signs of a mental health issue or has any diagnosed mental health conditions. Request i nformation from the caregiver directly. Document observations . Contact any mental health providers currently involved with the caregiver. If the caregiver is actively hallucinating or delusional, immediately contact the DC Department of Mental Health's Access Helpline at 1- 888-793-4357 or contact MPD for assistance. If applicable, contact the mental health provider to determine services and level of compliance. Caregiver medications prescribed for mental health conditions Observe and document the number of medication s, types of medications, prescription dates, along with the names and contact information (if available) for the prescribing physicians. REQUIRED TASKS FOR INTERVIEWING COMMUNITY SERVICE PROVIDERS Required Task Assess - Describe - Docu ment Social services received through the community Determine whether these providers are relevant to the investigation. Request information regarding any service provider involved with the family or children. Contact the service provider to determine i f they have any concerns regarding neglect or abuse. Determine what services are being provided to the family. Determine the family's level of compliance regarding service provision. Ensure that you have an appropriate release form for receipt of the provi der's information on the family. Healthy Family Thriving Communities Collaboratives Relevant services provided by Collaboratives Contact the assigned FSW to discuss any concerns regarding the caregiver or children. Determine what services are being pro vided. Discuss any new recommendations for service provision. If the family has received services from a Collaborative in the past , contac t the appropriate FSW to determine if the family was compliant with services. If the family was not compliant with ser vices in the past, consideration should be given to opening a case within the Agency for low -to-moderate risk cases due to past non -compliance. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 77 ALLEGATION -SPECIFIC INVESTIGATIONS FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 78 NEGLECT -RELATED SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR DRUG ACTIVITY EXPOSURE TO ILLEGAL DRUG ACTIVITY General considerations Illegal \"drug-related activity \" includes the use, sale, distribution , or manufacturing of a drug or drug paraphernalia without a legally valid license or medical prescription. Please f amiliarize yours elf with Drugs and their Effects (under Appendix II : Resources ) which discusses common aspects of drug use, including manufacturing. You should also be aware that legal allegation s regarding drug activity require \"regular\" exposure . This factor must be inc luded in the assessment. Most of our investigations of illegal drug ac tivity result from police drug raids on residences (or other locations ). You should approach these investigations with the knowledge that there can be a complicated relationship betwee n the CPS investigation and the ongoing MPD criminal case. At times MPD personnel may not want to give you full information for fear that it might be disclosed in the neglect case prior to MPD completing their own investigation . Because of this, two things are important: You need to be able to articulate specific needs for information pertaining to the CPS assessment , specifically i nformation t hat substantiate s the allegation of a child being regularly exposed to illegal drug activity . If you are not succe ssful in your communication, contact may need to be made with the sergeant involved in the case or with your management team to determine next steps. At times, MPD personnel may be able to share information \"off the record\" that will help inform the CPS in vestigation. When there are difficulties eliciting information from MPD , you should consider whether there is \"off the record \" information that can be shared . You can then determine if/when the information will be useful to the CPS investigation. \"Off the record\" information should not be documented in FACES.NET but can be used toward an overall understanding of the family situation during the investigation . Assessment details The following checklist is useful for ensuring that appropriate information is o btained during a drug raid investigation : How did the raid occur ? (E.g., was there a search warrant from an undercover purchase or a search warrant from other information source ?) Who is the affiant (i.e., the one who swore to the affidavit for the arrest ) or who is the officer who signed off on the search warrant? What were the police specifically looking for? Who was the suspect? What, if any, drug(s) were found? Specify types, amounts, and location. Could the children reasonably access the drugs? Photog raph the drugs and locations where they were found. Was drug paraphernalia found? Specify types and location. Was the paraphernalia a danger to the children (such as chemicals)? Were weapons and ammunition found? Specify types and location. If a gun was fo und, was it loaded? Were the weapons accessible by the children? Photograph the guns and locations they were found. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 79 Often a drug raid results in the physical upheaval of a home - you should ask the officers what condition the home was in prior to the raid . This information may be of concern. If there is any discrepancy about the living situation of the suspect(s), determine if there are indicators to suggest that the suspect lives in the home (e.g., mail with the suspect's name and the address of the home , or personal items and clothing of the suspect in the home ). Be sure that you obtain the names and dates of birth ( DOBs ) of all arrestees or persons involved in the raid , whether they are family members or not . This will ensure that these individuals do not impede the investigation . If they present themselves as resources for the care of the children, their involvement will be factored into this decision . Required tasks Any child visiting or living in the raided environment must be d rug test ed. The child should have both urine and hair sample tests conducted. These tests can be completed at Children's National Medical Cen ter upon your request. Pull the complete criminal history on the individuals involved in the investigation to determine any prior involveme nt with illegal drug activity. Speak to the affiant or the sergeant on the scene to determine if there is a history of other children frequenting the location of the drug activity or if there were other children at the scene at the time of the raid. Obtain the demographic information for these children and their caregivers . Create companion investigations as appropriate . SUBSTANCE -EXPOSED NEWBORNS General considerations Babies who are born exposed to illegal or non-prescribed prescription medication are some of the most at -risk children who come into contact with the child welfare system. Nationwide there are a variety of responses to these situations, including automatic removal by some state agencie s due to the baby's inherent vulnerability combined with the obvious impairments of the caregiver who is struggling with substance abuse. In the District, we do not hold a policy of immediate removal of these children nor do we immediate ly open cases . In cases of newborn exposure to illegal drugs , an allegatio n of substance abuse impacting parenting is entered at the CPS hotline. You, the CPS social worker, will conduct a thorough investigation and determine whether there is evidence that the substance use impacts the mother's parenting. In the event that you d o not have sufficient evidence to suggest this , you will still offer family supportive services. At times, removal may also be warranted given the severity of the situation . Remember that your approach to the caregiver is critical to obtaining accurate i nformation for the purpose of planning for the safety of the child and assisting the caregiver . Remember too that despite the effects of and behaviors related to substance abuse, this habit or addiction often grows out of significant pain and trauma. There fore, the engagement of the caregiver should not only involve acknowledgement of the facts but also the opportunities that the situation may present for positive change. Assessment Details When completing an assessment regarding allegations of positive to xicology for newborns, one must consider several areas . The overall mosaic of the family should be considered, including the information below, to determine if it is reasonable to believe that the mother is currently and will be FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 80 in the future a sufficientl y safe caregiver for a child. Removal should only be considered when a minimum basic level of care cannot be assured by the mother. You should make note of the following information: Type of drug used You must determine the possible side effects that the drug may have on the mother . Consider that some drugs can have longstanding effects on functioning (e.g., the negative side effects of \"flashbacks\" can impair decision -making). B ased on the type of drug used , you should also weigh the possible dangers of a relapse for the caregiver and the newborn. (Please refer to Appendix II: Resources , Drugs and Their Effects , for more detail s.) Frequency of use Discuss with the mother the frequency and patterns of her drug use. Whenever possible, statements made by ca regivers need to be compared with other sources of information ( CFSA and service provider history, drug testing records, accounts of family members, etc.). History of use Discuss also the mother's history of use and any periods of sobriety. Again, whenev er possible, remember that s tatements made by caregivers need to be compared with other sources of information ( CFSA and service provider history, drug testing records, accounts of family members, etc.). Caregiver behavior related to use You need to unde rstand that substance abuse does not happen in a vacuum. You must assess where and when the behavior occurs, where any children may be when this happens, and what other activity may be involved (prostitution, drug trafficking, etc.). All of these factors m ust be included in the overall assessment of and planning for the safety of the child. Caregiver attitude toward use Begin to determin e whether the caregiver acknowledges her use. This is often the first barrier to moving forward with an assessment. Given the positive toxicology screen , this can be an easier discussion than in some other substance abuse investigations. Further, talk with the mother about her willingness to participate in a drug test and substance abuse assessment. These are significant i ndicators of the Agency's ability to work with a caregiver around the serious issue at hand. Determine whether the mother acknowledges that she has a problem. This, as the saying goes, is \"the first step\" to teaming with the mother to address the substa nce abuse issue. Some mothers may not immediately be ready to admit their use so you should be prepared to take time to explain the options that exist for her should she elect to seek treatment. When faced with a mother who does not acknowledge her subst ance use, explain the significance of this \"denial\" and the difficulty that you face when considering whether her child is safe to go home if there is no acknowledgment that the use is occurring. You should also explain to the mother the potential conseque nces of not cooperating with both the assessment and the drug testing. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 81 Caregiver preparation for and attitude toward having a baby Determine what planning and preparation the mother made for her child's birth. Some mothers may not have intended to keep the baby so conversation may need to be held about the mother's thoughts and feelings about the reality of the birth of the child. You also need to determine at what point the mother became aware of her pregnancy and compare this with the accounts and timeline of drug use. Talk with the mother about whether she had prenatal care and find o ut the specifics details (e.g., provider location and frequency of visits). This information should be confirmed with the provider. Determi ne what other preparations the mother may have made for the birth of the child (e.g., obtaining appropriate supplies like a crib and diapers) and scheduling for services , such as medical insurance or the District's Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Support network Father Talk with the mother about the identity of the father , if he is unknown to you . At times the specific individual may not be known but as much paternal information as possible must be gathered , including any portion of a nam e or nickname, physical attributes, relatives of the father, last known whereabouts, places of employment, history of military duty, history of incarceration, etc. Note : A father needs to be identified officially through a birth ce rtificate, paternity tes ting, legal affidavit of paternity , or other method as noted under the General Considerations section of this POM . You should never allow a child to be released to a ny relative without legal identification . Once the father is identified, you should conside r him to be a care -giving option . You will still have to assess his relationship with the child, his desire and ability to care for the child, his support network, and whether there is any concern regarding substance abuse. Extended family Extended famil y support can be a key component to the overall safety of a child who m ight remain in the care of a mother who engages in substance abuse. Talk again with the mother about the child's father, as well as her support network and any extended family available to assist her should she relapse. Contact needs to be made directly with these individuals to assess their ability to act as a viable support to the mother. Required Tasks 1. Conversation with Hospital Staff and Review of Records The hospital staff often h as valuable information about family history as well as the current progress of the mother and child. You should review the family record to obtain a copy of the toxicology reports and pull other demographic information that may be useful during the course of the investigation , such as the parents' reported address (es), both parents' name s, and so forth. Oftentimes mothers may have frequented the hospital during the pregnancy and there may be additional information regarding any substance abuse history, the mother's planning for the pregnancy, or other helpful information. Ensure that you speak with hospital staff about this. Also, confer with the hospital staff about the mother's current bonding with the child and any concerns they may have about the family . Staff may not always seek out the CPS social worker so you must go to them. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 82 2. Substance Abuse Assessment Referral You must complete a substance abuse assessment referral for all investigations involving a positive toxicology screening for a newborn. 3. CFSA Nurse Referral (Clinical Health Services Administration ) You must also complete a referral to the C FSA nursing staff for all investigations involving a positive toxicology screening for a newborn. 4. Zero-to-Three Early Intervention Referral In accordance with federal law , all newborns with a positive toxicology must be referred to the Zero-to-Three Early Intervention Program. 5. Safe Home Assessment Ensure that the mother has a crib or safe sleeping arrangement for the baby. Ensure as well that the mother ha s supplies and a plan to have resources to feed, clothe, and shelter the baby. 6. Service Provision If an allegation of substance abuse impacting parenting is substantiated you will consider the risk factors and determine whether an open agency or a collabor ative referral would best serve this family; remember that collaborative services are always voluntary. If an allegation of substance abuse impacting parenting is not substantiated, you will still offer ongoing supportive services to the family, either in the form of a voluntary CFSA case or a collaborative referral. Be Prepared for any of the Following Possible Common S cenarios Mother reports that she is living out of the jurisdiction . CPS social workers should never give consent for a discharge of a ch ild without confirmation of the plan for where the child will be living and a full assessment that the child will be safe in the new jurisdiction . Unfortunately, not fully assessing this plan often leads to gaps in services that could have life -changing co nsequences for the newborn. You must make a referral to the proposed jurisdiction and follow through to ensure that this is actually the planned living environment. Mother tests positive but newborn does not . At times the Agency will be contacted by hospit als if a mother tests positive but the newborn does not. In these situations, if an investigation is assigned, the social worker should request that the hospital complete all possible tests for substances. One very useful test that is not always administer ed is testing of the newborn's meconium (the first stool sample ). Meconium can be tested for exposure in utero to drugs and alcohol. This test can show information that is not always seen in standard urine testing. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 83 MEDICAL NEGLECT INVESTIGATIONS In add ition to the steps you normally take during regular investigations, there a few extra steps required when investigating reports of medical neglect. For an adequate medical neglect investigation, you must indicate that you have made contact and comple ted an in-person or telephone interview with one or more of the child's medical providers . These notes are important for the following reasons: Information and facts from interviews with medical professionals will help inform your disposition decision. A substa ntiated medical neglect allegation require s a medical opinion justifying the disposition The disposition decision must be made in conjunction with one or more of the following medical professionals: CFSA nurse from the Clinical Health Services Administr ation (CHSA) Primary care physician Other physician(s) responsible for the well -being of the child Dentist Mental health professional Occupational or physical therapist Referrals You must make a referral to the CFSA nurses in CHSA for every medical neglec t investigation . The nurse referral form is located at the CHSA nurse's station . At a minimum, t he referral should request a consultation , in addition to immunization and medical records . Such records may also be obtained from other sources of information (e.g., a school or private physician) . Medical Child Abuse and Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy The American Academy of Pediatrics is utilizing the term \"pediatric condition falsification \" or \"simple child abuse that occurs in a medical setting \" to describe what has been formally known as Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy. These terms describe situations in which a parent or caregiver induces real or apparent symptoms of a disease in a child, causing injury to a child through unnecessary and harmful or potentiall y harmful medical care. These reports should be entered by the Hotline with the allegation of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy until the allegation is updated in FACES.NET . As Munchausen is correctly listed under abuse , all of these reports should be immed iately forwarded to Y ID. They will be assigned for investigation in most cases. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 84 Domestic violence is known to increase the threat of abuse to children. To protect child safety, you must carefully assess any incidents of domestic violence. Timely intervention is of the utmost importance! IDENTIFYING AND RESPONDING TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE (DV) What is Domestic Violence? District law incorporates several phrases to describe domestic violence, \"inte by D.C. Official Code \u00a716-1001(9) as an act punishable as a criminal offense that is committed or threatened to be co mmitted by an offender upon a person to whom the offender is related by blood, adoption, legal custody, marriage, or domestic partnership, or with whom the offender has a child in common. The D.C. Official Code \u00a716-1001(6a -b) definition of \"interpersona l violence\" includes those with whom the offender shares or has shared a mutual residence; or who is or was married to, in a domestic partnership with, divorced or separated from, or in a romantic, dating, or sexual relationship with another person who i s or was married to, in a domestic partnership with, divorced or separated from, or in a romantic, dating, or sexual relationship with the offender . For purposes of this practice guide, the definitions above collectively describe domestic violence (DV). As noted, it is not limited to marital relations. It can be specific to partnerships of varying types, including relations between former spouses, boyfriends and girlfriends, lovers, or those involved in emotional relationships without sexual involvement , e.g., violence among blood relations (i.e., adult siblings or an adult and an aging mother ). DV Includes the Threat as Well as Actual Use of Violence. DV is a social problem that affects every segment of the population. It crosses lines between race, socioeconomic status, religion , education , and gender .*It tends to be repeated with more frequency and more severity over time. The presence of DV in the home is known to pose significant risks to children ! *Although the statistical majority of DV victims are women , there are cases of DV where the victims are men. Additionally, perpetrators of domestic violence can be women or men. As noted, r esearch reveal s that exposure to DV in the home impact s child safety and well -being. Beyond watching or hearing the vi olent incident(s), exposure may include one or more of the following experiences: FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 85 Direct involvement of the child (such as the child trying to intervene) Experiencing the build -up of tension prior to the violence Experiencing the aftermath of an assault ( the child seeing bruises or observing parental depression) Exposure to the negative, aggressive behaviors and attitudes that accompany DV also increases the probability that children will copy those behaviors and attitudes. In other words, children who repeatedly witness domestic violence are more likely to use violence themselves to cope with or to resolve conflict. NOTE: Exposure to DV does not, in and of itself, constitute abuse or neglect. Rather, CPS must assess and document whether DV in the home has resulted in actual physical or mental injury or specific risk of harm to the children , this includes risk of harm that results from exposure to the violence in the home . No DV is the same, given this, there are times when removal of the children from a DV situation is the only method to ensuring their safety after careful consideration of all family dynamics. Assessment You should make every effort to gather the following information: Is there a ny knowledge of child attempting to interven e in DV incid ents? Are c hildren showing signs of serious emotional distress that appear to be connected to DV? For example, did symptoms such as bedwetting or behavioral problems begin or escalate following a violent incident? Is DV i nfluencing neglect of the child by either caregiver (e.g., the child is missing school or there is a lack of supervision, inadequate food , or clothing). What is the nature of the current violent incident? Who is the primary aggressor or abuser? What, if any, is the h istory of violence in th e home? S everity ? Frequency ? Is there a h istory of police involvement ? Is there any h istory of weapons in the home ? Has the a buser threat ened death or bodily harm to self or others ? Are there any Orders of P rotection or prior DV allegations in previous rep orts? Have there been a ny past follow through on prior safety interventions ? As always, documentation is necessary . This is not only for proving allegations of child abuse or neglect but also for securing needed interventions, such as Family C ourt-ordered services. Record the abusive partner's words and actions in detail. Note in the case record any of the following coercive or controlling behaviors: Does the abuser become agitated, threatening , or loud? Does the abuser i nterrupt or insult you? Does the abuser u se threatening remarks, gestures , or body language? Does the abuser i nterrupt constantly? Does the abuser blame or demean the survivor? Has the abuser directly or indirectly admitted any abusive or threatening actions or behaviors ? How is the abusi ve partner's behavior harming the children? FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 86 Full documentation of domestic violence dynamics should include such additional elements as detailed information about the batterer's parenting, the full spectrum of the non -offending parent's efforts to provid e for the safety and well -being of the children, and any other relevant information, e.g., finances, culture, substance abuse and/or mental health issues. Unless there is evidence of child abuse and neglect on the part of the survivor, it is imperative that the case notes avoid language that in any manner judges , states , or implies blame on the part of the survivor. Avoid using language such as \"dysfunctional family \" or parent \"allows\" or \"enables \" the violence or parent \"failed to protect\" the children . Focus your case notes on facts specific to the abuser's actions, particularly in relationship to the harm and risk of harm to the children. Required Tasks In the event of a credible safety concern related to DV, you must complete and attach an e -referra l form to the FTM unit in Entry Services via email within 24 hours of the repor t. a. You will be contacted by the CFSA DV specialist via email or telephone as soon as possible but no later than 48 hours upon the specialist's receipt of the IFSS A form. b. If the client refuses services, the DV specialist will make a note of this fact and enter the information in the FACES.NET Contact s Screen. DV Safety Planning Although the CFSA DV specialist may consult on a DV case, you play the vital role of working with the survivor and children to develop an immediate safety plan. For a safety plan to work, you will need to engage, involve, and collaborate with the survivor. Keep in mind that i t may be unsafe for the survivor to write down the safety plan if the abuser is stil l living in the household. In such cases, the survivor should be encouraged to memorize the plan . As the investigator, you should document the plan in FACES.NET and highlight the information as sensitive. Important Factors t hat Impact DV Safety Planning Circumstances that have precipitated past DV incidents (alcohol, drugs, stress, arguments, weekends, etc.) Past history of domestic violence incidents and the victim's response to those incidents The abusive partner's work schedule, location, and patterns Safest way to contact the family for future visits Identifying persons whom the victim can call or go to for help in an emergency (including 911) Legal actions, such as a civil protection order (CPO) - Note : If a current CPO exists, the social worker shou ld encourage parents to distribute copies to the child's school, day care center, and babysitter(s) . Access to important items (car and house keys, birth certificates, social security cards, medications, cash, etc.) Available services - survivor should be given contact information to Survivors and Advocates for Empowerment ( SAFE) Placement options for the survivor and the children - immediate shelter or a safe placement with friends or family - Don't forget to follow the guidelines for safety planning with parents . Police involvement (e.g., removal of all weapons from the house) FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 87 To speak to an Advocate : Domestic Violence Intake Center, NW DC Superior Court 500 Indiana Avenue, NW Room 4550 Washington, DC Friday 8:30am -4:30pm Domestic Violence Intake Center, SE United Medical Center 1320 Southern Avenue, SE Room 311 Washington, DC 561 DV CPS Practice Points under Appendix VI: CPS Practice Points for additional guidance and a list of service providers (including assistance for other language speakers) . Under Appendix II: Resources , you will also find the MOU between CFSA an d SAFE for the provision of DV services. Maintaining the Confidentiality of Clients Residing in Domestic Violence Shelters In responding to families where domestic violence is an issue , we must keep in mind that confidentiality equals safety. As the Distr ict's child protective services agency, we have the right to interview children who are allegedly the victims of abuse or neglect. At the same time, we want to ensure that we are not endangering the survivor. When attempting to conduct the investigation, s ome shelters may provide access an d others may not. If you learn of the shelter location, in order to know what to expect, you should consult with the Agency's DV specialist prior to making your visit. This staff member should be aware of the policies of t he local shelters and direct you accordingly. Some shelters may want you to contact them to make arrangements to see the family. Again, i n order to safeguard confidentiality, most DV shelters that do allow visitors, require that all visitors sign confiden tiality agreements. If the form is to protect the confidentiality of the address , then you may sign it and continue the investigation. Please see below on steps you are required to take to protect the address/location of the DV shelter. For those DV she lters that do not allow visits, you should work with the shelter staff to offer an alternative site for you to meet with the client. (This situation may arise in those shelters where living space is shared; permitting a CPS social worker into that shared s pace would violate the family or families not being investigated by CPS. ) The alternative site should be one that allows you to privately interview the client , such as an office in the main location of the agency sponsoring the shelter. The shelter staff should also be asked to provide the environmental information to the worker - that which you would ordinarily obtain from an on -site visit to the client's housing. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 88 Guidelines for Documentation of Sensitive Information References in the case record shoul d be made to the shelter's business address , which is often designated as a post office, i.e., P.O. Box number or a P.O. station versus the street address. The actual street address of the shelter should never be documented in FACES .NET or in a permanency hearing report or other court report or given to anyone directly or indirectly, particularly the abusive partner . CPS and In -home/Out of Home staff should clearly and boldly identify a ll information pertaining to DV safety planning ( e.g., a shelter's busin ess address or an actual address of a DV survivor) as \"Confidential Information Due To Domestic Violence, Do Not Share\". This same documentation is required when a DV survivor is residing in a homeless shelter, substance abuse program, or other non - confid ential location. In this situation, it is still imperative that the abusive partner does not learn of the survivor's location, directly or indirectly, from CFSA or contract staff. The address and name of the location should be clearly and boldly identified in the case record with \"Confidential Information Due to Domestic Violence, Do Not Share.\" Similarly, Family Court petitions should not include the survivor's address. The address should be listed on the face of the petition as \"Confidential\". The survi vor's address and the address of any service providers should be redacted from any records provided to parties in Family Court proceedings. Workers should consult with the assigned assistant attorney general or Office of the General Counsel if a request fo r an address that we have deemed to be confidential is made by law enforcement, a court, an attorney or party in litigation through a subpoena, or other such request to determine if the information must be provided and under what circumstances. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 89 INVESTIGATIONS OF CHILD P HYSICAL ABUSE The District of Columbia's 2012 Memorandum of Agreement on Child Physical Abuse Investigation, Prosecution , and Prevention (2012 MOA) enhanced the way a multidisciplinary team (MDT) of professionals \"work in concert\" to address the needs of child victims of sexual abuse. In accordance with the 2012 MOA, the MDT is required to focus on \"law enforcement, prosecution and related civil proceedings, and third, \"on the needs of the family members who support the bes t interests of the child.\" The MDT includes but is not limited to representatives from CFSA, MPD, the Children's National Medical Center (CNMC), and the Children's Advocacy Center (CAC). In addition, there is a 2011 District of Columbia Memorandum of Under standing and Inter -Agency Agreement on Child Maltreatment and Joint Investigations (2011 IAA) that has helped to inform this section of the POM . The following procedures are in compliance with the protocols listed in both the 2012 MOA and the 2011 IAA. In addition familiarizing yourself with these two documents , you are expected to be familiar with and fully comprehend each of the following definitions and concepts: The term \" physical injury \" means bodily harm greater than transient pain or minor tempor ary marks. The term \" mental injury \" means harm to a child's psychological or intellectual functioning, which may be exhibited by severe anxiety, depression, withdrawal, or outwardly aggressive behavior, or a combination of those behaviors, and which may b e demonstrated by a change in behavior, emotional response, or cognition. The term \" child abuse \" means infliction of physical or mental injury upon a child ; and sexual exploitation or sexual abuse of a child . Note : The meaning of the term \" child abuse\" does not include discipline administered by a caregiver to his or her child, provided that the discipline is reasonable in manner, moderate in degree , and otherwise does not constitute cruelty. REMINDER : Reasonable and/or appropriate \"discipline\" does not include - burning, biting, or cutting a child ; - striking a child with a closed fist ; - inflicting injury to a child by shaking, kicking, or throwing the child ; - non-accidental injury to a child under the age of 18 months ; - interfering with a child's breathing ; and - threatening a child with or using a dangerous weapon on a child (e.g. a firearm, knife, or any other prohibited weapon ). The above list is illustrative of unacceptable discipline but is not intended to be exclusive or exhaustive . The term \" physical p unishment \" is discussed in the 2011 IAA (based on case law) : FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 90 In order for physical discipline to be acceptable, it must be administered by a parent as a considered response to misconduct and be applied in a tempered, controlled manner with as little viole nce and consequent possibility for actual physical injury as possible, given the age of the child and the attendant circumstances. The 2011 IAA also discusses cultural differences for approaching disciplin e: Differences in disciplining children that are based on varying cultural or ethnic standards have no legitimate substantive role in determination of whether corporal punishment of children is reasonable or excessive. Finally, the 2011 IAA discusses scenarios where physical abuse is suspected but physi cal evidence is lacking: A history of increasingly violent, almost reflexive parental reaction may well support a finding of abuse . Even where the specific incident, which brought the case before the court, did not result in an observably serious injury t o the child, as the court must seek to protect the child from further risk of harm . SCOPE You are expected to work jointly with MPD 's YID to investi gate allegations of child physical abuse where the all eged perpetrator is the child's caregiver . You shoul d also investigate caregivers who fail to protect a child in their care from child physical abuse or physical assault . These investigations only encompass allegations that occur in the District of Columbia, regardless of the location of the child's primary residence. INVESTIGATION LEAD As a general rule, the assigned YID detective takes the lead for investigating and assessing serious physical injury and abuse allegations involving children. CFSA maintains primary responsibility for abuse cases that are n ot designated as immediate or serious physical injury and abuse. It is important for you to remember that response times for YID investigations and CFSA investigations do not always coincide. Since the 2012 MOU indicates that YID takes the lead on some p hysical abuse investigations, you must make contact with YID prior to initiating an investigation of a serious or immediate allegation. When you do make contact, you will want to discuss whether YID is responding, and your plan for ensuring the child's saf ety without compromising the criminal investigation. The interview with a child who may have been physically abused should follow the same components discussed in general child interview ing requirements . You will also want to gather the following informa tion to assess the entirety of the child's situation: The nature, extent, and cause of the abuse The identity of the person responsible for the abuse. 0 FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 91 The name, age, social security number , and address of all parents of the victim(s) and sibling(s) The name, age, sex , and condition of the abused child and all other children in the home The conditions of the home at the time of the incident Whether there is any child in the home whose health, safety, or welfare is in jeopardy because of his or her treatm ent in the home or because of his or her home environment Whether any child should be removed from the home or can be protected by the provision of resources to address treatment in the home environment If the child makes a disclo sure during this intervie w that indicates there is a current threat to the child's immediate safety, you should contact YID to determine what, if any, immedi ate role they may need to play. Special Note: Care should always be taken to minimize the number of times a child is inter viewed . YID may at times determine that the reported allegation does not meet their standard for an investigation , and will therefore turn it over to CFSA. This is known as \"TOT\"or \"TOTed\". In those situations, you become the lead and sole investigator of the allegations. If, however, during the CPS investigation, additional detail s or allegations are discovered that may suggest the need for a criminal investigation, these should be discussed with your management team and forwarded to YID for assessment. PRIMARY ASSESSMENT OF PHYSICAL SAFETY AND MEDICAL EXAMS Special Note : During the course of an investigation, it is best practice that a child should never be transported for a medical examination by the alleged perpetrator of physical abuse. If possible , the CPS social worker should accompany the parent(s) for any needed medical exams. When assessing a physical abuse allegation, you must first begin by ensuring that the child is not in need of immediate medical treatment. If a child is complaining of s ignificant pain or has other visible indicators of immediate injury, you must contact 911 . Purpose There are a number of reasons that medi cal examinations occur in physical abuse investigations: To assess the physical well -being of the child To gather any physica l evidence of a crime of physical abuse To provide the child with an opportunity to disclose during the examination Note: Disclosure to the medical provider may be able to be used in court. To reassure the child about his or her body Location Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) houses the Freddie Mac Child and Adolescent Protection Center (CAPC) , which specializes in assessing and treating victims of child maltreatment. CNMC, and specifically the CAPC, is the preferred provider for these e valuations. Families may elect, however, to have the child be seen by another provider. You and the detective are obliged to explain to family members the benefits of having the FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 92 child seen by a specialist at CAPC . You and the detective are also expected to facilitate the process, ensuring to the best of your ability that professional evaluations have taken place. REMINDER: In instances of immediate medical evaluation or follow -up medical evaluation, CAPC is the preferred provider. PHYSICAL OBSERVATION AND DOCUMENTATION OF INJURIES In many instances of physical abuse allegations, the matter will not require a medical evaluation by CAPC or other medical professional. In instances of minor or no injuries, you may be able to adequately record the injuries (or lack thereof) without the need of a medical professional. In the event that the injuries are not visible, your assessment must consider one or more of the following potential reasons that injuries are not present: No injury ever occurred. An injury occurr ed but bruising is not yet manifest on the child's body. An injury occurred but is no longer visible. An internal injury occurred that is not visible to the eye. When an injury does not appear to have ever occurred related to physical abuse, you must docum ent this in FACES.NET . Ideally, you will be able to demonstrate that no injury exists by photographing the area of the body where the alleged injury occurred. You should also be mindful that depending on how quickly you respond to a notification of alleged abuse, bruising and swelling may not always occur immediately. Follow up may be needed to determine whether visible injuries develop. (This is also true in situations where a child may have some injuries immediately present but others develop in the comin g days.) In instances where an injury may have faded or healed, you must, whenever possible, converse with the child about this injury, and describe in your FACES.NET documentation how the injury appeared at the time of the event as well as any related pa in or impairment in functioning that was a result of the injury. If there is any concern for an internal injury, a medical examination should occur. For example, a child who is punched with force in the abdomen may be suffering from damage to the organs . There may also be other internal injuries even though there is no visible, external injury. In the event that there are observable injuries, you must take care to describe each injury in detail (size, shape, color, etc.) in FACES.NET . You should also photo graph each injury. In doing so, it may be helpful to have a measuring tape or some other standard (dollar bill, coin, etc.) to hold next to the injury to demonstrate the nature and extent of the injury. NOTE: CFSA Has Legal Authority to Take Photographs and To Require Radiological Examinations (D.C. Official Code \u00a7 4-1301.08) . Any person responsible for the investigation may take or have someone take photographs of each area of possible trauma on the child or of the conditions surrounding the suspected a buse or neglect of the child . If medically indicated, you may also request that the child have a radiological examination, including full skeletal x -rays. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 93 CHILD ADVOCACY CENTER (CAC) INTERVIEW Criteria for CAC Interviews Whenever there is an allegation of child physical abuse , the following categories of children are required be interviewed at the CAC , unless the prosecutor and detective have determined that a CAC interview is unwarranted: Any child aged 5 years or younger who has any of the following injuries: Suspicious burns Suspicious head injuries Injuries with an implausible explanation Injuries of different ages which are indicative of a pattern of abuse Medical Abuse Adult -sized bites Other serious injuries that involve hospitalization or surger y All other children aged 12 or younger who may be a witness to the physical abuse of a child victim or to a child fatality caused by abuse All other children aged 12 or younger who live in the same household as a child victim discussed above, if the lead detective believes a criminal prosecution is likely to occur Note: While a forensic interview at CAC may not be required in all cases, detectives and CFSA investigative social workers are encouraged to utilize CAC whenever it may assist the investigation or help to better serve the needs of child victims or witnesses. Scheduling Any MDT member may schedule a CAC interview but the primary responsibility for scheduling is that of the assigned detective . Note: Since all MDT members have committed to accom modating one another's schedules when coordinatin g the interviews, all parties who are directly involved with the investigation are expected to be present for the interview. CAC interviews should be scheduled, whenever possible, on the same business day as the referral . When the initial CPS assessment suggests that a CAC interview is immediately warranted, this should be elevated and addressed through your chain of command. At times , a CAC interview may be required after the close of standard business hour s due to emergency circumstances. In such instances, the assigned detective may contact the on -call interviewer from CAC to conduct the interview. If the initial CPS assessment suggests that a CAC interview is immediately warranted and there are concerns r egarding scheduling, this should be elevated and addressed through your chain of command. Counsel Notification of a CAC Interview When a child is represented by counsel (aka the GAL ), this counsel must give consent for the interview . Counsel also has a ri ght to be present. If you have knowledge of counsel for a child or if a child has been removed , please ensure that this information is shared during the scheduling. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 94 Transportation Coordination of transportation is the responsibility of the MDT member sch eduling the interview. In general, this will be the assigned YID detective. The MDT members should always endeavor to work together to address transportation. Decision Not to Hold an Interview The MDT members may determine in any given matter that a CAC i nterview is not necessary or warranted. At times, an interview may not be held due to unaddressed mental health needs of the child. If the child is currently receiving therapeutic services, coordination is required to occur between you, CAC, and the serv ice provider to determine if an interview is appropriate. If no services are in place, CAC may be scheduled at a later date, after therapeutic services are in place. The average age for CAC interviews is 3 -12 years old. There are times, however, when MDT members will determine that a detective can successfully interview a teenager in an environment outside of CAC. If you believe that the environment at CAC would be most appropriate to ensure the teenager's well -being, you should advocate for the teen and re quest that the interview take place in the CAC environment. Keep in mind that there is no other child - friendly location for the purposes of recording an MDT interview. Unexplained or Inconsistent Injuries General considerations A CPS investigation is wa rranted when a child has a serious injury and one of the following circumstances exists: No explanation is provided but an explanation should be available , given the type of injury (e.g., serious bruising, lacerations/abrasions, burns, bite marks, or fractures). An explanation is provided but it is inconsistent with the injury . Multiple explanations are provided but statements are inconsistent. Assessment Details Detailed Timeline In collaboration with the MPD detective, the social worker should obtain a d etailed timeline (when ever possible ) of any events precipitating or sur round ing the child's injury , including the following information : Physical location of the child Feeding and sleeping patterns (if a small child) Persons responsible for the care of the child Persons with access to the child Demeanor or behavior of the child, including anything out of the ordinary Any history of falls, injury, or other unusual incidents Assessment for neglect If an unexplained injury is ultimately determined to be accid ental, the assessment should still occur to ensure that there are not any neglect factors, such as supervision concerns. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 95 Removal Discussion Removal of a child should be considered under the following circumstances : A child has an unexplained injury that is indicative of abuse. A child has an unexplained injury that could be accidental but, if accidental, would have been memorable enough to be able to relate the circumstances around the injury. If it can be determined that the injury occurred outside of the responsibility of the primary caregiver , removal may not be necessary . You must still make a very thorough assessment to ensure that the primary caregiver currently uses appropriate judgment in the care of the child and is able to p rotect the child in the future. Required tasks Medical Examination/Medico -Legal* In matters involving unexplained injuries that are suggestive of possible child abuse , you must ensure that a medical examination takes place . Depending on the severity of the injury, this examination may need to occur immediately to ensure safe planning for the care of the child. Ideally, these examinations will occur at the CNMC Child and Adolescent Protection Center. * A medico -legal examination is an examination specific to physical and sexual abuse .FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 96 CHILD FATALITY INVESTIGATIONS General Considerations Child fatality investigations and \"near -fatality\" investigations are high -profile and sensitive . The CPS Special Abuse Unit will usually investigate these matters in collaboration with the MPD Special Victims Unit (SVU). It is very important to realize that m any child deaths are officially found to be of natural or undetermined causes . Be very mindful that even accidental or undetermined deaths can be associated with neglect factors (e .g., poor supervision, inadequate sleeping arrangements, or caregiver substance abuse). At other times , you will find yourself work ing with the police on abusive deaths due to homicide. Be mindful as well that a specific allegation of abuse or neglect is not required for CPS investigations into child fatality matters. The following scenarios are possible: The Hotline call reflects allegations of neglect or abuse that must be dispositioned through an investigation. A Hotline call does not reflect allegations of neglect or abuse but due to the uncertain nature of the child's death a CPS assessment is warranted : o The a llegations may be discovered during the course of the assessment, be added to the investigation, and be dispositioned prior to closure of the investi gation. o No abuse or neglect concerns surface during the investigation and the investigation is closed without needing entry or disposition of allegations after appropriate assessment and service provision. Assessment Details Observation of the Decedent In most child fatality investigations, you will be respond ing to the location of the decedent to observe the child and gain an initial understanding around the child's death. You should observe the child, in collaboration with hospital staff or police to de termine if there are injuries or other notable factors (such as the child's hygiene or physical appearance). Interview with Emergency or Hospital Personnel You should speak with hospital personnel regarding the child's method of transport to the hospital, the initial impressions of the parent or caregiver, the history taken by hospital staff around the child's death, and any other pertinent information. Remember to make note of and record the initial impressions of the hospital staff regarding the child's death and use this as a foundation for the assessment. Detailed Time Frame around Death Request a detailed timeline of events around the child's death and any precipitating events . You should team with the MPD detective to gather the following information : Physical location(s) of the child Feeding and sleeping patterns (if a small child) Persons responsible for the care of the child Persons with access to the child Demeanor or behavior of the child, including anything out of the ordinary Any history of fal ls, injury, or other unusual incidents FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 97 Details of the Mother's P regnancy and the Child's B irth An interview should be held with the mother (or father) around the pregnancy and birth of the child to gather the following information : Prenatal care Pregnanc y complications Type of delivery and any complications Pre or full -term birth and birth weight Details of the Health, Development , and Basic Care of the Child (including sleeping and feeding of young children) Your assessment should include details of the child's health history (or if a \"near fatality\", then current health), including any diagnosed conditions, medications, the child's primary doctor , and any other medical examinations. You should also discuss with the caregiver whether the child was (or is ) meeting the standard developmental milestones. Further, the basic care of the child should be discussed , including the feeding and sleeping patterns of young children. Family Health History Determine if there is any pertinent family history of disease or illness that could be related to the child's death. Details of Autopsy Findings An autopsy is conducted for most child fatality investigations. The SVU detective, and often a detective from YID, will attend the autopsy. Typically the autopsy is conduc ted within a few days of the death and the detective will share with you the initial autopsy findings. Th ese details can be vital to your overall investigation . They may, for example, reveal additional bruising or internal injuries not observable at the ti me of the child's death. Cause of Death v s. Manner of Death \"Cause of death \" is the chain of events that led up to the death (such as cardiac arrest or complications from an existing disease). The \"manner of death \" falls into one of five categories: Natural Suicide Homicide Accidental Undetermined Due to the length of time required for a full autopsy report, the cause and manner of death may not be officially determined when you are in the process of determining whether or not to close the investigation . If this takes place with your investigation, you should consult with your management team to decide whether there is sufficient information for a safe closure of the investigation without the official report. It may be that the initial autopsy findings w ill be sufficient to make your determination for a safe closure . FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 98 Required Tasks Zero-to-Three Early Intervention Referral In the event of a child fatality where there are surviving children (age s 0-3) in the family, you are required to refer these infa nts or toddlers for a preventive early intervention screening. Medical Assessment of Siblings When a child dies under unknown or suspicious circumstances, any surviving siblings should be medically assessed. For investigations involving unexplained inju ries or abusive death, a medico - legal screening should be obtained . It is preferred that the assessment occur at the CNMC Child and Adolescent Protection Center. Clinical Health Services Nurse Referral A referral to one of CFSA's CHSA nurses is mandatory in any child fatality investigation. Assistance for D eath Notification You should offer assistance to families for the notification of death in all child fatality investigations. Excellent resources include t he clinical coordinator at CAC and staff at t he Wendt Center for Loss and Healing ( 4201 Connecticut Ave. NW, Suite 300, Washington, DC 20008 | Tel 202.624.0010) . Make certain that all family members are emotionally ready and equipped to have this conversation . In matters involving abuse and neglect, you should ensure that professionals take the lead in such discussion s so there is no additional trauma to the child. Offer of Grief Counseling It is your responsibility to offer referrals for grief and loss counseling to family members involved in child fatality investigations. Offer Funeral Assistance If a family has an open case with CFSA, the Agency may be able to assist financially with funeral arrangements for the decedent. Please check with your supervisor regarding this process and the availabilit y of funds. I f the family has no involvement with CFSA , you should meet with the family to assist them in accessing public services for funeral arrangements . This can be done through their neighborhood Collaborative or the Department of Human Services. Critical Event Meeting You and your management team will work together with other Agency staff during a critical event meeting to disc uss the status and next steps of this investigation. This meeting will be coordinated and facilitated by Quality Assurance p ersonnel from CFSA . This meeting is typically held within 24 business hours of the critical event. CFSA Internal Child Fatality Review This meeting typically occurs several weeks after a child fatality investigation is completed. Your participation is re quired along with members of the CPS management team. At this time , the team members will review the family's history with CFSA as well as reviewing details around the child fatality. The following areas are topics of discussion: o Did CFSA take every actio n and make every reasonable effort to ensure the safety of the child and other children in the household? FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 99 o Are there any practice, training , or policy issues that need to be resolved as they relate to the respective child fatality? Are there other systemic issues that need to be addressed, such as supervision, staffing, access to records etc.? o Knowing what we know now, what would we do differently? o What are the interagency issues to present to the District of Columbia Child Fatality Review Committee? o Were there parental or familial behavior factors that contributed to the fatality? OVERVIEW OF SEXUAL ABUSE INVESTIGATIONS AND SAFETY EVALUATIONS As noted in the section on physical abuse, the 2012 MOA enhanced the use of a multidisciplinary team (MDT) of pr ofessionals first to \"work in concert\" to address the needs of child victims of sexual abuse and second to focus on the law enforcement, prosecution and related civil proceedings , and third on the needs of the family members who support the best interests of the child. Reminder : The MDT includes but is not limited to representatives from CFSA, MPD, the Children's National Medical Center (CNMC), and the Children's Advocacy Center (CAC). The following procedures compl y with all protocols listed in the 2012 MOU regarding child sexual abuse investigations and evaluations. It is further usef ul and expected that you become familiar with and fully comprehend each of the following definitions from the D.C. Official Code : D.C. Official Code : \u00a7 16-2301 (32) The term \"sexual abuse\" means\" (A) Engaging in, or attempting to engage in, a sexual act or sexual contact with a child; (B) Causing or attempting to cause a child to engage in sexually explicit; or (C) Exposing a child to sexually explicit conduct . D.C. Official Code \u00a7 16-1001 (9) \"Intrafamily violence\" means an act punishable as a criminal offense that is committed or threatened to be committed by an offender upon a person to whom the offender is related by blood, adoption, legal custody, marriage , or domestic partnership, or with whom the offender has a child in common D.C. Official Code \u00a7\u00a7 16-2301 (34) and 22 -3001 (8) \"Sexual Act\" means FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 100 (a) Penetration, however slight, of the anus or vulva of another by a penis; (b) contact between the mouth and th e penis, the mouth and the vulva, or the mouth and the anus; or (c) the penetration, however slight, of the anus or vulva by a hand or by any object, with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person. The emission of semen is not required for the purposes of subparagraphs (a) - (c) of this paragraph. D.C. Official Code \u00a7\u00a7 16-2301 (35) and 22 -3001 (9) \"Sexual Contact\" means The touching with any clothed or unclothed body part or object, either direct ly or through the clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person. For the purpose of CPS investigations , child sexual activity is defined as sexual behavior that is considered developmentally precocious or inappropriate and potentially symptomatic of a child who has been sexual ly abuse d. In addition to being familiar with the relevant terminology, you must also be familiar with the following components of investigation and the evaluation procedure s: The overall scope of investigations and evaluations Individual roles and responsibilities for different members of the MDT Conversations with non -offending caregivers Medical examinations (purpose, location, etc.) CAC interviews (including the decision not to hold an interview) Handling of historical allegations Required investigation tasks and FACES.NET documentation It is also important to recognize the legal limit ations of CFSA's responsibility, i.e., you may only investigate allegations against a caregiver acting in loco parentis. Notwithstanding this limitation, the Agency is still legally and professionally responsible for ensuring the safety of children in the District of Columbia. Therefore you must still conduct safety evaluations involving intra -familial sexual abuse and reports of child sexual activity . If, however, allegations against a caregiver are identified during the course of an evaluation, the matter should then be converted into an investigation. The overall section on sexual abuse is divided into the following categories: Investigations of Child Sexual Abuse FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 101 These are matters involving allegations of child sexual abuse of a minor victim (at the tim e of offense) by a parent or caregiver acting in loco parentis . An example of this is a child who was sexually abused by her father. Another example would be a child who was sexually abused by an aunt who is the child's primary caregiver and acting in loco parentis. Safety Evaluations of Intra -Familial Child Sexual Assault These matters involv e sexual abuse of a minor victim (at the time of offense) by a family member who is not a parent or a caregiver acting in loco parentis . This includes offenses on children by adult family members who are not parents or who do not play a caregiving role for the child. An example of this might be an uncle who resides in the home but who is not acting in loco parentis . This also includes offenses on children by relatives w ho are minors. If there is force involved in the assault , there is no required age difference between the children. If the activity was \"consensual\" there is a 4-year age difference required between the victim and perpetrator to consider this an assault in vestigation. An example of this would be a 13 year old who forcibly rapes his 12 -year-old cousin. Another example of this would be a 17 year old who is having \"consensual\" sex with her 12 -year-old brother. Safety Evaluations of Child Sexual Activity These matters include behaviors, statements, or other indications of developmentally inappropriate sexual knowledge suggestive of potential child sexual abuse. If more than one child is involved, such activity must have occurred between children with less tha n a 4-year age difference (unless force is involved - see above) . Evaluations of such matters do not require an intra -familial relationship between the children, nor do the children involved need to live in the District. If the report alleges that the chil d sexual activity occurred in the District, CFSA will evaluate for the safety and well -being of the child. If concerns develop during the course of the evaluation regarding any failure to protect or any other maltreatment by a caregiver acting in loco parentis, the evaluation must be converted to an investigation and the appropriate allegations added to FACES.NET . When working with a \"child -on-child\" sexual activity evaluation, a primary evaluation is taken regarding the family of origin of the alleged perp etrating child (if one can be determined). It is your responsibility to carefully assess whether the perpetrating child has suffered sexual abuse or whether there are any other children at risk for being exposed to the perpetrating child. Under such circu mstances, the alleged victim child is assessed as a collateral source of information to the evaluation. You and your management team have the d iscretion to determine whether the situation warrants further intervention, or whether to enter a companion evaluation or investigation regarding the victim child's family of origin. Safety Evaluations of Suggested Sexual Abuse These matters include circumstances that are only suggestive of sexual abuse. The abuse may have occurred or it may potentially occur. The c hildren living under the following situations may be victims of sexual abuse or vulnerable to potential sexual abuse: Exposure to adult sexuality Residing with a sexual offender Sexual exploitation of the child (pornography , prostitution, etc.) Other risk factors related to sexual abuse Reports on any of the above situations may be accepted on a case -by-case basis and should be discussed amongst CPS management prior to acceptance for evaluation. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 102 Note: An allegation that a caregiver exposed a child to live or simulated sexual activity is only taken as a sexual abuse safety evaluation IF the alleged perpetrator was intentionally exposing the child for sexual gratification. All other matters may be investigated as general neglect and are handled by tradition al units. INVESTIGATIONS OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE Scope In accordance with the 20 12 MOU, you are expected to work jointly with the MPD 's YID to investigate allegations of child sexual abuse where the all eged perpetrator is the child's caregiver . You will also investigate caregivers who fail to protect a child in their care from child sexual abuse or sexual assault, e ven if the perpetrator is not acting in loco parentis . These investigations encompass allegations that occur in the District of Columbia, regar dless of the location of the child's primary residence. Investigation Lead As a general rule, the assigned YID detective takes the lead for investigating and assessing sexual abuse allegations involving children. There is, however, a standing agreement t hat an immediate joint investigation shall occur when a report includes information that an alleged perpetrator lives in the same home of the alleged victim, or has regular access to the child victim, which subsequently indicates a potential immediate danger to the child. In such instances, you should communicate as soon as possible with YID for commencing the joint investigation accordingly. SPECIAL NOTE : Alleged perpetrators may also be minors who live in the same home and may also pose an equal level o f danger . If information about access between a perpetrator and a child is discovered during the investigation, this should be discussed with your management team and forwarded to YID for intervention. It is important for you to remember that response ti mes for YID investigations and CFSA investigations do not always coincide. Since the 2012 MOU indicates that YID takes the lead on sexual abuse investigations, you must make contact with YID prior to initia ting your investigation to discuss whether they ar e responding and to discuss your plan for ensuring the children's safety without compromising the criminal investigation. When you are not able to conduct a joint investigation because a detective has not been assigned, you should not directly discuss the sexual abuse allegations with the caregiver or child. Doing so may compromise the future police investigation by prematurely disclosing sensitive information. In these cases, i deally, the child should be interviewed at school or in another neutral environ ment. If the child must be interviewed at home, which obviously informs the caregiver of the investigation, you should explain that the Agency has received a complaint regarding the safety and well -being of the child and that you are there to assess the sa fety and well -being of the family. In some situations, you may need to provide some information to the caregiver in order for the caregiver to protect the child (e.g., if the uncle is the alleged perpetrator and he visits the home, the caregiver can be put on alert). The interview of the child should follow the components discussed under the section, General Child Interview , including a preventive assessment for sexual abuse. If the child makes a disclo sure during the interview that impacts their immediat e safety, you should contact YID to determine what immedi ate role, if any, they may need to play. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 103 Special Note : Care should always be taken to minimize trauma by limiting the number of times a child must be interviewed. YID may at times determine that t he reported allegation does not meet their standard for an investigation . In these types of situations, you are the lead and sole investigator of the TOT'd allegations. If, however, during the CPS investigation, additional detail or allegations are discove red that may suggest the need for a criminal investigation, you should consult with your management team and forward the information to YID for assessment. Conversation with Non -Offending Caregiver When a child has been sexually abused, there may be a no n-offending or protecting caregiver involved. You must take care to thoroughly assess the non-offending caregiver's ability and willingness to ensure the safety of the child and to follow through on needed services for the child. Written s afety planning is a crucial component for maintaining stability for a child victim in these situations . Safety planning should be used anytime that a child remains with a non -offending caregiver . All details of the plans should be written down. You, the caregiver, and your supervisor should all sign the safety plan . In addition, please consider the following factors when assessing the caregiver's ability to protect the child both physically and emotionally: Prior knowledge of the sexual abuse and the possibility of a lack of protection by the non - offending caregiver Non-offending caregiver's knowledge of previous deviant sexual behavior by the alleged perpetrator, which may present a danger to a child Attitude of the ca regiver toward the victim child, alleged perpetrator , and allegations Willingness of the caregiver to ensure that the perpetrator does not have access to the child, including obtaining a protective order Willingness of the caregiver to participate in ongoing services for the child , including the CAC interview , medical examination, and therapeutic services When discussing the investigation with a non -offending caregiver , you should instruct th e caregiver on appropria te interaction between the child and alleged perpetrator. In situations where the alleged perpe trator is an adult, the non -offending caregiver must agree in writing that the alleged perpetrator will leave the home (if applicable) and further, that the alleged perpetrator will not have any access to the alleged victim or other at -risk children in the family. Further, t he caregiver should not unduly discuss the investigation with the child. The alleged perpetrator should not be informed of the investigation, nor should the caregiver confront the alleged perpetrator about the allegations. Medical Exam ination Purpose There are a number of reasons that medical examinations occur in sexual abuse investigations: To assess the physical well-being of the child To gather any physical evidence of a crime of sexual abuse To provide the child with an opportunit y to disclose during the examination . Note : disclosures to the medical provider may be able to be used in court! To reassure the child about his or her body FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 104 Special Note : It is best practice that a child should not be transported to a medical examination by the alleged perpetrator of sexual abuse. Location The Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) houses the Freddie Mac Child and Adolescent Protection Center (CAPC) , which specializes in assessing and treating victims of child maltreatment. CNMC, and specifically CAPC, is the preferred provider for these evaluations. Families may elect, however, to have the child seen by another pro vider. Note: You and the detective are obliged to explain to family members the benefits of having the child seen by a sp ecialist at CAPC . You and the detective are also expected to facilitate the process, ensuring to the best of the family members' ability that professional evaluations have taken place. When Sexual Abuse is Reported to have Occurred within the Last 72 hour s or When the Child is Unable to Articulate a Time Frame Children who have suffered sexual abuse or assault within the last 72 hours should be seen for immediate medical attention. You and the YID detective should assist any non -offending caregiver with t his process. The YID detective will take responsibility for coordination of an exam by a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) and will also be responsible for the \"sex kit\" (if one is to be completed.) You should never take possession of a sex kit (nor tr ansport it to the hospital). Special Note : The sex kit is considered legal evidence and is subject to the chain -of- custody rules involving the police department and the hospital. Similarly, you should never take possession of the original \"medico -legal\" form that is completed by a physician after sexual assault examinations. This, too, is considered a legal document and is subject to the chain -of-custody regulations. Still, you must obtain a copy of the \"medico -legal\" document for use in the CPS investig ation and for any Family Court proceedings in which CFSA is involved . Working with the Caregiver If a caregiver is unwilling to take steps to have the child examined, you and the detective must make every effort to explore and alleviate any of the caregiv er's concerns . It is a good idea to reiterate the important reasons for this immediate examination . Reminder : Sexual abuse and sexual assault disclosures are typically traumatic , not only for the child but also for the non -offending caregiver. It is import ant that you allow the caregiver an appropriate measure of time to process the information while simultaneously striving to empower the caregiver to make the best decisions for the well - being of the child. You should assist the caregiver in managing their emotions and composing themselves so as to minimize trauma to the child and to allow the parent to provide appropriate support to the child. If a caregiver remains unwilling to allow for the medical examination, then you must inform the caregiver (without coercion) that this may be grounds for a disposition finding that the child is without proper parental care and without the control needed to ensure the child's safety. If concern persists regarding completion of the medical examination, this should be di scussed with the caregiver and your management team . There may be a FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 105 need to take custody of this child to ensure that this examination occurs and the child's well-being is addressed. When an initial examination has succe ssfully taken place, you and the YI D detective should also assist the family with any follow -up care that may be needed, such as further testing or therapeutic services . Collectively, you can determine the outcome. When Sexual Abuse is Reported More than 72 Hours after the Alleged Occurren ce The following shall occur within 48 hours of the report : All children 12 years of age or younger who are the subjects of any type of sexual abuse allegation must be taken for an examination. YID will use its discretion as to whether a sex kit is requi red. All children between the ages of 13 and 17 who allege any penetration, attempted penetration, or oral-genital or anal offense , shall be taken for a sexual assault examination. YID will provide sex kits in all of these cases. When a child over age 12 alleges sexual abuse by fondling, YID will use its discretion as to whether a medical examination is warranted. When there is No Disclosure When an investigation alleges sexual abuse, but there is no disclosure by the child at any time , there is still a p ossibility that sexual abuse occurred. It is the Agency's practice to recommend that a child who does not disclose still be taken for a medical examination when there is suspected child sexual abuse . If you are unsure whether or not to recommend a medical examination, please consult with your supervisor for immediate guidance. During this consultation you should share with your supervisor the reasons why despite no evidence, you believe that a medical exam is necessary. CAC Interview Criteria for CAC Int erviews Unless the prosecutor and YID detective have determined that a CAC interview is unwarranted, the following categories of children should be interviewed at CAC when there is an allegation of child sexual abuse: Any child under age 12 or Any child o ver age 12 with the following qualifiers: - An intra -family relationship with the offender - Emotional, developmental, learning , or other disabilities - Alleged victim is non-communicative on the scene Scheduling Any MDT member may schedule a CAC intervie w but it is the primary responsibility of the assigned detective . Note : Since all MDT members are committed to coordinatin g schedules with one another for the interviews, all parties who are directly involved with the investigation are expected to be prese nt. CAC interviews should be scheduled, whenever possible, on the same business day as the referral . FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 106 When the initial CPS assessment suggests that a CAC interview is immediately warranted, the request for an interview should be elevated and addressed thro ugh your chain of command. At times , a CAC interview may be required after the close of standard business hours due to emergency circumstances. In such instances, the assigned detective may contact the on - call interviewer from CAC to conduct the interview. If the initial CPS assessment suggests that a CAC interview is immediately warranted and there are concerns regarding scheduling, this should be elevated and addressed through your chain of command. Counsel Notification of a CAC Interview When a child is represented by counsel (aka the GAL ), this counsel must give consent for the interview . He or she has a right to be present. If you have knowledge of counsel for a child or if a child has been removed , please ensure that this information is shared during the scheduling. Transportation Coordination of transportation is the responsibility of the MDT member scheduling the interview. In general, this will be the assigned YID detective. MDT members should always endeavor to work together to address transporta tion. Decision Not to Hold an Interview MDT members may determine in any given matter that a CAC interview is not necessary or warranted. If MDT members determine that a CAC interview is not needed in a sexual abuse matter, notification should still be made to CAC to ensure coordination of services, follow -up with the child and family, and systems record maintenance. At times, an interview will not be held due to a child's unaddressed mental health needs. If the child is currently receiving therapeutic s ervices, coordination may be necessary. It will be up to you, CAC, and the service provider to determine if an interview is appropriate. If no services are in place, CAC may be scheduled at a later date, after therapeutic services are in place. Remember: The CAC usually only interviews children under age 13. However, there are times when the MDT members will determine that a YID detective can successfully interview a teenager. If you believe that the environment at CAC would be the most appropriate to ens ure the teenager's well -being, you should advocate for the interview to be held there. Keep in mind that MDT members have no other child -friendly location for the purposes of recording an interview. Historical Allegations CFSA does not have a statute of limitations for reports of sexual abuse. Nonetheless, there are such limitatio ns within the criminal system. You need to be prepared in such instances to investigate historical situations without police assistance. When considering his torical allegations, you must not only consider the current allegation but also whether the alleged perpetrator has access to other children. If there is credible justification to determine that the historical sexual abuse occurred, then steps should be taken to conduct safe ty evaluations on any children with whom the perpetrator FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 107 could have had inappropriate contact. These tasks should be coordinated with MPD whenever possible. SAFET Y EVALUATIONS: INTRA -FAMILIAL CHILD SEXUAL ASSAULT Scope Intra-familial child sexual assault evaluations occur in matters involving a perpetrator fitting the definition of an intra -familial relationship (see Overview section above) but the perpetrator IS NOT a parent or caregiver acting in loco parentis . These evaluations encompass allegations th at occur in the District of Columbia, regardless of the location of the child's primary residence. Reminder : The perpetrator in these matters may be a minor or an adult. Note: In order f or a minor to be considered a perpetrator , there must be a 4-year age difference between the perpetrator and victim , except in cases of forcible sex, in which case there is no required age difference. In the situations where the alleged perpetrator is a minor , there are no allegations per se to be investigated by CPS. Yo u must still evaluate, however, the safety and well -being of the child. If concerns develop during the course of the evaluation regarding any failure to protect or regarding other maltreatment by a caregiver or caregiver acting in loco parentis , the evalua tion must be converted to an investigation and the appropriate allegations added to FACES.NET . For reports of a \"child -on-child\" sexual assault, the social worker shall evaluate the family of origin of the alleged perpetrating child and assess whether the perpetrating child has suffered sexual abuse. In addition, the social worker shall assess whether there are any other children at risk of being exposed to the perpetrating child. In such matters, the alleged victim child is assessed as a collateral sourc e of information to the evaluation. You and your management team will have the d iscretion to decide whether the situation warrants further intervention, or whether to enter a companion evaluation and investigation of the victim child's family of origin. Evaluation Lead As a general rule, the assigned YID detective takes the lead for evaluating sexual assault allegations involving children. There is, however, a standing agreement that an immediate joint evaluation shall occur when a report includes informa tion that an alleged perpetrator lives in the same home of the alleged victim, or has regular access to the child victim, or there is obvious or imminent danger to the child. In such instances, you should communicate as soon as possible with YID to begin the joint investigation a s appropriate . Reminder : Alleged perpetrators may also be minors who live in the same home and may also pose an equal level of danger . If information about unsafe access between a perpetrator and a child is discovered during the e valuation, this should be discussed with your management team and forwarded to YID for intervention. It is important for you to remember that response times for YID evaluations and CFSA evaluations do not always coincide. As a result, it may be challengi ng in some instances for your evaluation to begin without an assigned detective. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 108 NOTE: When you are not able to conduct a joint evaluation due to a detective not being assigned, you should not directly discuss the allegations with the caregivers or child . Doing so may compromise a future police investigation by prematurely disclosing sensitive information. Ideally, the child should be interviewed at school or other neutral environment. If the child cannot be interviewed in a neutral environment and must b e interviewed at home, the specific allegations should not be directly discussed with the caregiver . You should simply explain that the Agency has received a complaint regarding the safety and well -being of the child and you are there to assess the safety and well -being of the family. The interview of the child should follow the components discussed under the section titled, General Child Interview , including a preventive assessment for sexual abuse. If the child makes a disclosure during this interview, th e police should be contacted to determine what immediate role , if any, they may need to play. Special Note : Care should always be taken to minimize trauma by limiting the number of times a child needs to be interviewed. MPD may at times determine that t he reported allegation does not meet their standard for an evaluation. In those situations, you will be the lead and sole evaluator of the TOT'd allegations. If , however , additional detail s or allegations are discovered during the CPS evaluation , and you determine there is a need for a criminal investigation, you should consult with your management team and forward the information to MPD for assessment. Conversation with Non -offending Caregiver When a child has been sexually assaulted, there may still be a non -offending or protecting caregiver involved. You must take care to thoroughly assess the situation and, if necessary, to follow through on needed services for the child. Safety planning is also a crucial component for maintaining stability for a child victim in these situations . Please refer to page 97 for factors you should consider when assessing the caregiver's ability to protect the child both physically and emotionally . Safety Planning after Sexual Abuse Allegations Safety plans should be detai led and written. They must be signed by the social worker, caregiver, and supervisor. Under no circumstance should CPS personnel be party to a safety plan that does not include removal of an adult offender from the family home . When the offender is an adu lt, the safety plan must include a strategy to prevent the offender from having access to the victim. When the offending child is a minor and a lack of resources prevents the family from planning for separate living situations for the perpetrator and vict im, a very specific and careful safety planning must occur. The preferred safety plan involves both discontinued contact and separate living situations for the perpetrating youth and victim . REMEMBER! YOU ARE REQUIRED TO MONITOR SAFETY PLANS UNTIL SUCH T IME THAT THE CASE IS TRANSFERRED. Medical Examination FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 109 Please see the discussion regarding medical examinations above under the Sexual Abuse Investigations section and follow the guidelines outlined there. Special Note : It is best practice that a child should n ot be transported to a medical examination by the alleged perpetrator of sexual abuse. CAC Interview Please see the discussion regarding medical examinations above under the Sexual Abuse Investigations section and follow the guidelines outlined t here. Note: See page 101 concerning how to investigate h istorical allegations FACES.NET Core Contacts and Assessments Because there are no allegations in volved in safety evaluations , the standard medical and educational core contacts are not required. The non -offending caregiver is expected to be appropriately caring for the child, including being aware of the child's medical and educational needs. The family 's privacy will not be invaded further by investigating these areas. If there is cause to suspe ct a problem, you should follow -up on a case -by-case basis as needed with the child's medical and educational providers to ensure the child's safety and well -being. The safety assessment shall be completed for all safety evaluations. The risk assessment is not required as it involves investigation of the non -offending caregiver. An example of such a scenario ... A 10-year-old female lives with her biological parents. The mother's brother is in town visiting and provide s child care for the 10 year old on one occasion while the parents are at the movies. The uncle has no prior sexual abuse history and there have been no indicators to suggest that he is an inappropriate caregiver for children. Nevertheless , during this child care situation, the uncle fondled the 10 year old and told the child that if she disclosed he would do the same thing to her 5 -year-old sister. When the parents returned home, the 10 year old was able to speak to her parents privately and disclosed what happened. The parents responded by bel ieving the child, calling the police, and ensuring that the uncle did not have access to the children until the police arrived. In this scenario, the parents are not under investigation. CPS is only involved as it relates to ensuring the safety and well-being of the children. This is done in teamwork with the parents. Collateral contacts with primary medical doctors, educators, and so forth for the family children will not be completed as there is no reason to suspect concerns in these areas. On the other hand, if school personnel or medical providers have knowledge of the sexual assault allegations , they should still be contacted. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 110 SAFETY EVALUATIONS: CHILD SEXUAL ACTIVITY Scope As noted in the Overview of this section, reports of child sexual activity can include behaviors, statements, or other indications of developmentally inappropriate sexual knowledge suggestive of potential child sexual abuse. If more than one child is involved, such activity must have occurred within the household . Evaluations of such matters do not require an intra -familial relationship between the children . If concerns develop during the course of the evaluation regarding any failure to protect or any other maltreatment by a caregiver , the evaluation must be converted to an inve stigation and the appropriate allegations added to FACES.NET . When working with a child sexual assault evaluation, a primary evaluation is taken regarding the family of origin of the alleged perpetrating child (if one can be determined). It is your respon sibility to carefully assess whether the perpetrating child has suffered sexual abuse or whether there are any other children at risk for being exposed to the perpetrating child. Under such circumstances, the alleged victim child is assessed as a collater al source of information to the evaluation. Both you and your management team have the d iscretion to determine whether the situation warrants further intervention, and whether to enter a companion evaluation or investigation regarding the victim child's family of origin. Evaluation Lead As a general rule, the YID detective who is assigned to a sexual abuse evaluation also takes the lead in assessing the reported child sexual activity. If an alleged perpetrator lives in the home with an alleged victim, or has regular access to the child, MPD and CFSA will immediately conduct joint evaluations, particularly if there is immediate or potential danger to the child. Upon assignment of an evaluation related to child -on-child sexual activity, you should determine if there is immediate danger to the child and whether it is necessary to contact YID for a joint evaluation. Reminder : Alleged perpetrators may also be minors who live in the same home and who may also pose an equal level of danger. Since the response t imes for CPS evaluations and MPD evaluations do not always coincide, it may be challenging to begin a child sexual activity evaluation without an assigned detective. When you are not able to conduct a joint evaluation because a detective has not been assi gned, you should avoid direct discussion about the allegations with the caregivers or children. Direct discussion may compromise a future police investigation by prematurely disclosing sensitive information related to the allegation . Ideally, the child sho uld be interviewed at school or at any other neutral environment. If the child cannot be interviewed in a neutral environment and must be interviewed at home, the specific allegations should not be immediately discussed with the caregiver. Explain simply t hat the Agency has received a complaint regarding the safety and well -being of the child an d you are obliged to assess the safety and well -being of the family in general. The interview with the child should follow the components discussed under the section titled, General Child I nterview , including a preventive assessment for sexual abuse. If the child makes a disclosure during this interview, the police should be contacted to determine what immediate role , if any, they may need to play. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 111 If information ab out unsafe access between a perpetrator and a child is discovered during the evaluation, this should be discussed with your management team and forwarded to YID for intervention. MPD may at times determine that the reported allegation does not meet their standard for an investigation. Under these circumstances, you are considered the lead and sole evaluator of the TOT'd allegations. If, however, during the evaluation additional detail s or allegations are discovered that may suggest the need for a criminal investigation, these should be discussed with your management team and forwarded to MPD for assessment. Medical Examination A forensic medical examination is not required for child-on-child sexual activity evaluations but it is recommended. You should e nsure that the caregiver for each child is given information on CAPC and you should recommend that the child have a medical examination. Since there are no direct allegations of sexual abuse during an evaluation of child-on-child sexual activity, you may n ot necessarily be able to require a caregiver to comply with the request for a medical examination. CAC Interview As noted above, there are no direct allegations of sexual abuse during a n evaluation of child-on-child sexual activity. Therefore a CAC inte rview may not be required in every instance. Nevertheless, the CAC will participate in \"precautionary\" interviews of children in this category if a detective is assigned. Unless there are specific reasons why a CAC interview is not necessary, the CPS worke r should arrange for a CAC interview for child-on-child sexual activity evaluations. If there is a determination that a forensic interview is not necessary , this should be discussed with your management team and the detective if one is assigned. Historic al Allegations When evaluating historical child-on-child sexual activity allegations, the CFSA social worker should carefully consider what purpose CPS involvement will serve, particularly when there is no formal allegation and the Agency will have no auth ority to substantiate an allegation, even if it is true. Factors for Consideration o Where does the family currently reside? If the family resides outside of the District, consider a referral to the CPS unit in the appropriate jurisdiction. In such instan ces, the evaluation will be closed with CFSA although further MPD investigation may occur. o Does any child need supportive services? If the child is stable and there are no other safety factors, an evaluation from CPS may not be warranted.

SAFETY EVALUATIONS WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SUGGESTIVE OF SEXUAL ABUSE Scope As a CPS social worker, you are responsible for conducting evaluations even when circumstances are only suggestive of sexual abuse that may have occurred or potentially will occur . Children living under the following situations may be victims of sexual abuse or vulnerable to potential sexual abuse: Exposure to adult sexuality for the sexual gratification of the perpetrator Residing with a sexual offender Sexual exploitation of the child (pornography , prostitution, etc.) Other risk factors related to sexual abuse Reports on any of the above situations may be accepted on a case -by-case basis and should be discussed amongst the CPS management prior to acceptance for evaluation . Note: Allegations that a child is exposed to sexual activity by a caregiver are only taken as sexual abuse safety evaluations if the alleged perpetrator was intentionally exposing the child for their own sexual gratification. All other matters may be in vestigated as general neglect and are handled by traditional units. Evaluation Lead If there is a YID detective assigned to a report that fits the above criterion, the detective will maintain lead responsibility for the evaluation or investigation , if war ranted. In many instances, such matters are initially evaluated by CPS alone. Medical Examination A medical examination should occur when there is credible reason to believe that a child has been sexually abused or assaulted. Even in instances such as exp osure to pornography or a child displaying risk factors related to sexual abuse, a medical examination should still be recommended to the caregiver, regardless of whether there is no direct information of sexual abuse or sexual assault. If there are any qu estions with regard to whether a medical examination is warranted based on the evaluation of this criterion, you should consult with your management team . Special Note : It is best practice that a child should n ot be transported to a medical examination by the alleged perpetrator of sexual abuse. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 113 CAC Interview When there are no direct allegations of sexual abuse or sexual assault, a CAC interview may not be required.

FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 114 INSTITUTIONAL INVESTIGATIONS All Hotline reports that allege abuse or neglect at facilities that are (or should be) licensed or certified by the District of Columbia are \"institutional abuse\" referrals and will be investigated by CFSA's Institutional Investigations unit. When investigating institutional abuse, you will conduct the investigation in one or more of the following settings: Emerge ncy care facilities Licensed or temporarily -licensed resource homes in the District Independent living programs Runaway shelters Youth group homes Youth shelters Any other out -of-home facility that provides custodial care, including daycare centers, before and after -care programs, hospitals, residential facilities, acute psychiatric care facilities, and all other licensed facilities (or facilities that should have been licensed) that provide direct care or supervision of children and youth REMEMBER: Institutional abuse and neglect includes physical or mental injury, sexual abuse or exploitation, negligent or maltreatment of a child by any individual at the facility or resource home responsible for a child's out -of-home care, including one or more of the fol lowing providers: The child's foster parent An employee or staff person from a public or private residential home or facility Other persons legally responsible for the child's welfare in a residential setting General Guidelines An investigation of institut ional abuse requires the same cooperation, teaming, and sharing of accessible information as that which occurs between CPS and all other CFSA administrations during any other investigation, including but not limited to teaming with CFSA -contracted and CFSA staff that is responsible for licensing, monitoring, placement, and program operations. Whenever a Hotline report meets any of the following criteria, the institutional investigation must be initiated immediately : A child is left alone. A child is left w ith inadequate supervision. A child is in immediate danger. Priority Level I report ( see \"Priority Criteria \" attachment from the Hotline Policy ). Note: For all Priority I reports, the CPS institutional investigator must contact YID to coordinate a joint in vestigation. When you receive an assignment to investigate an institutional abuse report, you must immediately notify the CFSA staff member responsible for monitoring the private agency, or the resource development specialist responsible for licensing th e facility . This includ es youth shelters, runaway shelters, emergency care facilities, and youth group homes. You must team and coordinate the investigation with that assigned monitor o r licensing specialist. Note: If the facility is not licensed by CFSA, you should contact and notify the appropriate licensing agency that a Hotline report has been FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 115 received and there are concerns related to the safety of children in placement. When appropriate and practical, you can arrange a joint investigation. REMINDER: If any report of abuse or neglect is identified as having a Priority Level I response, you may proceed independently of the monitor or licensing specialist (if they are unavailable) but you must contact YID . Procedures When investigating foster homes, not ify the Foster Care Resources (FCR) administration and inform the appropriate monitor of the investigation . You should share all relevant and necessary information, and jointly coordinat e the investigation. If the monitor is unavailable for a joint investi gation, you must inform the assigned supervisor and request follow -up from the monitor within 24 hours. When investigating facilities, notify the Facilities Licensing Unit in the Office of Planning, Policy, and Program Support and follow the same procedure s as #1 above. The licensing specialist, if unavailable, must confer with you within 24 hours. For all Priority I investigations that were not held jointly, you must schedule and convene a meeting within 48 hours of the investigation to share information w ith either the FCR s taff or the Facilities Licensing Unit. If there are no removals during investigations of institutional abuse, the assigned monitor or licensing specialist make s weekly visits to the home or facility where the allegations are reported. During the course of the investigation, as the institutional investigative social worker, you will continually team with the monitor or licensing specialist to review case notes, interviews, and other records to jointly assess the information. When you have made your disposition decision after investigating a facility, the licensing specialist has 5 days to issue a separate report with recommendations for any proposed licensing actions. SPECIAL NOTE : Child placement s are \"on hold\" for any resource hom e or facili ty under investigation until such time as the investigation is completed and closed . Removals If you have been unable to jointly investigate an institutional abuse report, and you have decided to remove a child or youth from a home or facilit y, you must notify the assigned monitor or licensing specialist of the removal . You must describe the basis for the decision as well as any additional concerns regarding the safety and well being of the other childr en placed with the provider. When applica ble, the monitor or licensing specialist should be involved in the development of a safety plan. If the child is removed from a foster home, the ongoing social worker must notify the resource parents of their right to a fair hearing. Notification may be oral or in writing but they must take place within 24 hours of the emergency removal. Prior to an adjudication of neglect , non -emergency removals do not take place until there has been at least 48 hours notice. After an adjudication of neglect , non -emergen cy removals do not take place until there has been at least 10 days notice . If the foster parent requests a Fair Hearing, the removal does not take place until after the Fair Hearing. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 116 Written Reports of Institutional Investigation Findings You must comple te a written report within 30 days of the disposition decision . The report details your investigation's findings. Notification of Disposition and Right to a Fair Hearing must be sent to the alleged perpetrator within 7 calendar days ( see CFSA 's Fair Hear ings Policy ). The monitor or licensing specialist discuss es the investigation findings with the foster parents or facility administrator, as appropriate, within 5 business days of the notification of the investigation findings. You should send a copy of th e written report with the disposition to the ongoing social worker and the child -placing agency or facility administrator. The ongoing worker notif ies the caregiver and the GAL of the disposition decision, including where the incident occurred and those wh o were involved. If any licensing action was taken, the licensing specialist forward s this information to the ongoing worker, the caregiver, and the GAL. Disposition Staffings Disposition staffings are convened at the end of the institutional investigatio n in order to share the findings and to discuss any concerns regarding the child who was the subject of the report or any other children placed within that placement resource. The staffing provides a forum for shared decision - making and serves as a vehicle for developing a corrective or safety plan. When the facility or resource home is licensed by CFSA, a disposition staffing will be held within 30 days of acceptance of the report being received at the hotline, in order to review the findings of the invest igation. The institutional investigations supervisor chair s the disposition staffing and notif ies the following individuals of the staffing date and location: Institutional investigations social worker Licensing specialist Monitor CFSA general counsel (only if a legal consultation is needed during the disposition staffing) On-going supervisor On-going social worker Attendees at the disposition staffing will participate in the following activities: a. Discuss the results of the investigation. b. Review the chi ld's current placement and determine whether any change is required to protect the child's safety and health. c. Review the contract status and identify any additional steps to be taken to protect the child or other children placed in the same setting. d. Discus s the facility's compliance with applicable District of Columbia Municipal Regulations. e. Determine whether and when to take action concerning the license or the contract.

Given their high vulnerability , it is imperative that you conduct a thorough assessment of their safety and well -being. As a required practice, comprehensive assessments must take place, and must include direct observation of the child. You should take a close look at thei r medical history as well as any other additional needs. When referring abuse and neglect cases to the Early Care and Education Administration, follow this guidance: Refer children to the Early Care and Education Administration as soon as any needs are identified through your assessments or through information shared by the family members or other persons familiar with the child. However, keep in mind that a 0 -3 screening is required for all cases that are substantiated and there are children under 3 ye ars of age in the household. Complete the 0-3 Early Intervention Screening Referral Form and manually forward the form to the Clinical Health Services Administration. Be sure to file a hard copy in the child's case record. The following steps will guide your assess ments of safety and risk for children 0 -3 and help you to determine appropriate interventions and service needs: Gather the child's birth information . Gather the caregiver s' information : o Assess the role of the father and mother, or any other caregivers. o Determine if the mother received prenatal care and whether the child was exposed to drugs, alcohol , or medication during pregnancy . (Seek a substance abuse consult if the mother has used illegal drugs, or if you suspect she continues to use drugs or alcohol .) Assess the caregiver capacity to care for the infant . Gather information about the child's general care and development : o Primary caregiver o Size & development o Feeding o Sleeping arrangements (Inform the caregiver that \"co-sleeping \" with the baby is very dangerous and that a baby can be hurt or suffocated if an adult rolls over the child.) Remember: It is recommended that babies sleep on their backs on a firm mattress without pillows or stuffed toys or blankets near the babies face!

Do the caregiver and baby look at each other? Does the baby appear comforted when the caregiver picks him/her up? Does the caregiver or others make positive statements about the baby? Does the caregiver smile when talking about the ba by? Does the baby cry, smile , or laugh? How does the caregiver respond to the cries? Can the caregiver differentiate between different cries? Recognize what each crying sound expresses? Does the baby react to toys and other objects? Is the baby socially re sponsive? Does the baby have a regular eating and sleeping schedule?

FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 120 The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend co - sleeping with an infant in the first year of life. The Dangers of Co -sleeping Co-sleeping with an infant can be very dangerous! It puts the infant at high risk of accidental death due to suffocation. This may happen when caregiver s accidentally roll over onto their infant or the infant suffocate s in the bedding or pillows. We understand that caregive rs may want to keep their babies close to them at night to make it easier for them to access their infants quickly for night feedings. We also know that some caregiver s may not have a separate bassinet or crib for their infant. Even still, we strongly reco mmend that caregivers not sleep in the same beds as their baby! Because co -sleeping is a practice valued by many families across cultures, it is important to know when it is not safe. According to Dr. William Sears, a renowned pediatrician, families sho uld not co -sleep, if one or more of the parents are: Under the influence of drugs or alcohol. This includes prescription medications, cold medication, sleep medication, or even a couple of beers or a glass of wine. Extremely obese. The large size of the parent poses a physical risk of smothering, and people who are obese often suffer from sleep apnea, a condition that reduces alertness. Overly exhausted. Sleep deprivation is a commonly a factor in households with new babies. If parents feel they are to o tired to wake for the baby, then a bassinet next to the bed is a safer option. As an alternative, caregivers may place the infant in a traditional bassinet or portable crib that is placed right next to the caregiver's bed. This way, the baby is in a saf e sleeping place yet close enough for bonding and monitoring. For those families who do not have a safe sleeping space for their baby, please consult with your management team for guidance. NOTE : Sharing a bed with infants, or -co-sleeping may increase t he risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) by five ; about 2,100 infants in the U.S. die yearly from SIDS . Given th is number of fatalities , this point cannot be emphasized enough . FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 121 ASSESSING CHILDREN WITH KNOWN OR POTENTIAL EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS Child De velopment and Special Service Needs As a CPS social worker, you MUST understand child development milestones in order to recognize what may be missing in the development of the children during your assessments. You are not expected to conclude that a child 's developmental lag is serious but you must recognize when the child needs further evaluation or specialized treatment. Assessing Children with Exceptional Needs Children with exceptional needs include those with physical, emotional , or mental disabil ities. Some of these disabilities may present as physical or mental delays, blindness, hearing impairments , mobility challenges, dependency, behavior management problems , emotional difficulties, etc . Children with exceptional needs are also vulnerable chil dren, more so than a wholly healthy child . Specifically, child vulnerability refers to a child's capacity for self -protection. If the child has a diagnosis or condition, you must describe it in detail in your notes. Children with Exceptional Needs: Spec ial Areas of Consideration With any of the below, please consult your supervisor if you have any concerns. Communication - How does the child best communicate? Verbally? Visually? Through a communication board? Drawing? Frequently, receptive skills are hig her than expressive skills, therefore it is important to speak with someone who knows the child's skill level. Mobility - What are the child's mobility capabilities? Can the child get around on his or her own? What is the level of freedom of movement? Dependency - Is the child solely dependent on the care of someone else? Lifelong dependency may cause a child to be trusting and less likely to question care or requests from caregivers . The child may have become accustomed to others providing personal care, therapy , or some other type of assistance with a caregiver being in a position of authority. As a result, the child may confuse exploitation with appropriate care. Compliance - Children who require specialized care or supervision are sometimes rewarded fo r being compliant. Assertiveness or self -advocacy may not be encouraged. Be aware that sexual interest and development for children in the mild and moderate ranges of developmental disabilities occurs at about the same time it occurs in typical peers. Lack of skills in protecting oneself from sexual abuse may place the child at risk. Cognition - Sometimes it may be difficult for a child to identify or understand a situation in a way that represents what actually happened. The challenge may involve process o r language, or the child may not understand the nature of the situation (e.g., a child requiring personal care may have difficulty identifying exploitive touch). Isolation - The circle of friends and outside acquaintances may be limited and activity -driven , thus limiting the opportunity for the child to have people in whom to confide. If a child has been the victim of someone who is familiar, there may be fear of retaliation. If the child has few contacts, even the loss of someone who may have been harmful can still be frightening. Behavior Control - Behavior is a means of communication. Some behavior controls are psychotropic medication, isolation from others, or the use of other types of restraints. Credibility - There may be times when some of the indi cators of abuse are overlooked because they overlap with the child's disability. For example, a child may be on medication that impacts their affect, resulting in communication challenges that may inadvertently \"cover up\" an indicator. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 122 Engaging Caregive rs who have Developmental Delays As a CPS social worker, you may receive a referral involving a caregiver who has developmental disabilities. Do not be misguided into thinking or assuming that people with cognitive disabilities cannot be adequate parents . This is not the case. Research studies indicate that most parents with cognitive disabilities have unique combinations of strengths and support needs. They still establish loving bonds with their children. It is important to realize that parents with cogn itive disabilities share many common problems: The day-to-day demands of car e-giving are a common challenge for the parent with disabilities . Parents with cognitive disabilities tend to have some difficulty retaining and correctly applying the informatio n and skills needed for adequate parenting. Many lack social and play skills and have difficulty with managing money. For parents who have difficulty in communication and social relationships, the effect is seen not only in the parent -child relationships but also in the family's ability to relate to others within the community, including the service systems that become involved in their lives . You must be sure to continue to use your core helping skills and maintain your objectivity when assessing these types of families and the children in the home. Conduct your investigation as you would with other families. The practice guidance below will help you interview parents or caregivers with learning disabilities: Keep interviews as short as possible. Take a break if the parent or caregiver seems to be losing concentration. Keep your questions simple and be prepared to probe the responses given. Avoid close -ended questions. For example, ask the parent to describe a situation versus asking the parent a \"yes\" or \"no\" question. Note: Many people with a learning disability are eager to please, so be careful not to prompt them with a suggestion or they may agree with what you have said rather than accurately describe the situation . Be very patient with the proces s and allow time for repetition. The D.C.

INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT The federal Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) of 1978 was implemented in part because of the failure of individual states in recogniz ing the importance of tribal relationships and the specific cultural and social standards existing within individual tribal communities. ICWA expresses a clear preference for preserving an American Indian child's ties to the tribal community, even if the child never had a previous relationship with the tribe. ICWA enumerat es the minimum federal standards for the removal of American Indian children from their family home and subsequent placement in the foster care system. ICWA grants tribes the right to intervene in custody proceedings, such as the Court proceedings in which CFSA is a party. Therefore CFSA, beginning from a hotline report needs to be cognizant of children's possible American Indian heritage since if the matter is brought to court, it becomes the responsibility of the District of Columbia to notify the child' s tribe if an American Indian child and/or family have come to the District's attention. If there is a suggestion of an American Indian heritage, you are responsible for the following activities: 1. Gather the following information, as available: a. Name of t he child, the child's birth date, and birthplace b. Reasons why there is a suggestion that the child is an American Indian c. Name of the American Indian tribe d. Names and addresses of each member of the child's biological family, including maternal and paternal family members or American Indian custodians 2. Submit the information to OAG -OGC via email within 2 business days of receiving responses to the inquiry. OAG -OGC contact s the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) (and the tribe if one has been identified) in order f or them to determine the child's membership or eligibility for membership in a federally -registered tribe. Note: If the child is not removed, no notice is required, and thus there is FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 126 no need to notify the OAG -OGC 's office. If, however, there is a suggestio n that the child is American Indian, the information must be documented both in FACES .NET and the case record. 3. Document the child's American Indian heritage on any applicable reports (e.g., FTM reports or complaint forms). Notification to the BIA is the responsibility of OAG -OGC . See CFSA's administrative issuance CFSA -11-8 Compliance with the Indian Child Welfare Act for detailed procedures . 4. Submit the information to OAG -OGC via email within 2 business days of receiving responses . SPECIAL INTEREST INVE STIGATIONS Investigations involving an individual of \"special interest\" include, but are not limited to, elected or appointed officials (including judges), MPD and YID officers, and CFSA or CFSA -contracted employees. As with all CPS investigations, confi dentiality is paramount. Only specifically designated CFSA staff members can conduct a special interest investigation. This person is usually an individual within the CPS Administration. If an MPD member is involved, a MPD YID manager, lieutenant or above shall be notified. FACES.NET access to all information related to the investigation is restricted. Only the identified CPS staff has access to the investigation. Typically these investigations are handled by the CPS Special Abuse Unit or the CPS Instit utional Investigations Unit. If you discover during your investigation that a person of \"special interest\" is involved, you must immediately notify your management team and await further instruction. Specifically, if you have an investigation involving an MPD officer you must immediately confer with your management team and also with YID. Contact CFSA's General Counsel. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 127 DECISION -MAKING AND PLANNING FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 128 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR ASSESSING SAFETY & RISK To support the Agency's goal of safety, perm anency and well -being for children and their families, two assessments are completed during the co urse of every CPS investigation: (1) SAFETY and (2) RISK . SAFETY VERSUS RISK SAFETY RISK Safety deals with present or imminent danger. Risk is the likeli hood that a child may be abused or maltreated in the future. Safety factors pose a threat of immediate or imminent harm. Risk elements identify significant behaviors and circumstances within a family unit that create different levels of risk to the child. Safety factors pose a threat of serious harm. Risk may be very high even if the report is unfounded; conversely, risk may be low even if the report is substantiated. In order to control for safety , there must be an assessment of the need for immediate interventions, the vulnerabilities of the child, as well as strengths, resources , and protective capacities present in the family. Risk may be reduced with appropriate services, changes in the caregiver's behavior, along with support from family and the c ommunity . SAFETY , which deals with present or imminent danger , is assessed every time you interact with a child or family throughout the investigation. T he safety assessment process is documented in FACES.NET and will be detailed in your contacts and a ssessment notes. RISK is the likelihood that a child may be abused or maltreated in the future. The S tructured Decision Making (SDM) risk assessment tool assesses families for low, moderate, high, or intensive probabilities of future abuse and neglect. T hese risk levels , along with your clinical judgment, guide the decision whether or not to open a case, whether to refer the family to a collaborative, or whether to close an investigation with no further services. THE SAFETY ASSESSMENT You are required t o complete the safety assessment at the onset of an investigation in order to determine the immediate threat or danger of harm to the child. In addition to the signs of present danger , the safety assessment identif ies the caregiver's protective capacities and the child's vulnerabilities. The initial safety assessment must be completed within 24 hours of the time of intake at Hotline. Please reference the documentation section for additional details on completing this assessment in FACES.NET. Remember ! Safety decisions must be made for each child participating in the household. Decisions may differ for each child depending on the allegations and circumstances. A safety decision should be completed within 24 hours of the report even if no contact has been established. However, you are required to update the safety assessment as you make contact with the children and assess their safety. Keep in mind that you can submit a referral to the Healthy Families Thriving Communities Collaboratives (HFTCC) at any point during the course of the investigation. The se referrals can be FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 129 made regardless of whether the allegations are unfounded or substantiated. Note : Along with risk levels that are low or moderate, t he HFTCC accepts referrals for which the allegations are unfounded but for the SDM risk level is high or intensive . Note: The provision of services or other assistance to the child's family takes place throughout all child welfare intervention, including CPS. Do not delay any needed referrals for services or supp ort to the family to the HFTCC or other government agencies or community -based service providers. Safety is assessed on an ongoing basis throughout the life of an investigation or Agency case. Since you are assessing safety every time you see a child or family, the FACES.NET safety assessment allows for updates. Every safety assessment update should be documented in FACES.NET within 24 hours of the change in assessment. Signs of Present Danger In consideration of safety you must assess for signs of prese nt danger. Remember that a sign of present danger is defined as a reasonable cause to believe that a child is, has recently, or could be in the near future in immediate danger of serious harm. The sign of present danger does not need to be occurring in you r immediate presence but when considering it, you should keep in mind the incident or concern that prompted your involvement with the family. Remember that signs of present danger are not always fault -based. They are simply a reflection of the level of dan ger posed to a child. ( For additional information on signs of present danger, see Safety Planning & Interventions ). EXAMPLE S OF PRESENT DANGER #1 A 2-year-old child is found wandering in the street without supervision. Neighbors contact the police, who respond and call for CPS assistance. By the time the CPS worker responds, the mother is located and able to provide care. In this instance, there was a sign of present danger in that the young, vulnerable child was without appropriate adult supervision. Remember that the safety decision will always be based on your assessment of a number of factors, including the parent's protective capacities and the child 's vulnerabilities. (See Completing the Safety Assessment in Appendix IV: CPS Supporting Documentati on.) If the caregiver appears to be unable to provide proper care or control of the child's immediate needs for sufficient supervision , you must protect the child from immediate danger of serious harm. #2 A 4-year-old arrives at school with a black eye. The school fails to report this information to CFSA until 2 weeks later. The child then discloses that the child's mother punched her in the eye because she spilled her milk. The school staff confirms witnessing the injury and when you interview the child, she also confirms that she was injured. By the time you observe the child, however, the injury is no longer visible because of the delay in reporting. Here you have a credible reason to believe that the child suffered an injury inflicted by his parent. T he safety decision will, again, be based on your overall assessment of a number of factors, including the parent's protective capacities and the child 's vulnerabilities. If you have any concerns regarding the potential level of danger to a child, or if y ou are not certain whether there is imminent danger, you should consult with your management team. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 130 Protective Capacities Protective capacities are the ability and willingness to utilize internal and external resources to mitigate or ameliorate the identi fied safety and risk concerns that put a child's safety in jeopardy. Protective capacities include the ability to support the ongoing safety of the child. A protective capacity is a specific quality that can be observed and understood to be part of the way a caregiver thinks and feels such that he or she evidences protective behavior . For example, there may be a non -offending caregiver in the home who is able to supervise interaction with the offending caregiver , provided that the offending caregiver does n ot pose a danger by his/her mere presence. Protective capacities are distinguished from controlling or supplementing safety interventions , which suggest a spec ific action or actions that are taken to protect the child. For example, if a non -offending careg iver choose s to protect their child by removing the offending caregiver from the home, s/he would have exercised a safety intervention. While it is true that this caregiver likely has significant protective capacities, it was actually the safety interventi on that protected the child. Safety Decisions A safety decision is ultimately your conclusion as to whether the child is in immediate danger of serious harm and what is protecting the child, either through mitigating fact ors and family strengths, or by prompt interventions put in place by CPS to control safety threats. All of the information you gather during the safety assessment will be used to support this decision. Keep the following decision options in mind as you plan your investigation and assessmen t: No signs of present danger were identified at this time. Based on currently available information, the child is not likely to be in immediate danger of serious harm. One or more signs of present danger were identified , however, the child is not in imme diate danger of serious harm or the existence of protective capacities offsets the threat of serious harm for the child. One or more signs of present danger were identified that places the child in immediate danger of serious harm , and controlling or suppl ementing safety interventions have been initiated. With these controlling or supplementing safety interventions, the child will remain in the home at this time. One or more signs of present danger were identified that place s the child in immediate danger of serious harm . Removal to foster care or an alternative placement (or continued placement) is the only controlling safety intervention possible for the child. One or more signs of present danger were identified, which place s the child in immediate danger of serious harm, but the caregiver has refused access to the child or fled, or the child's whereabouts are unknown. Appropriate legal and investigative actions are being taken. Thorough documentation of your safety decision is essential . The safety decisi on must specifically document WHY there is or is not imminent danger (based partly on allegations) or how the immediate danger has been ameliorated. You must explain the information you considered for coming to your decision and, if applicable, indicate an y next steps related to safety. Pointers for Safety Decisions At times there will be no immediate sign of present danger ( such as when it is clear that the allegation is untrue or when a child is safely hospitalized but could be in danger when discharged) . You must select the safety decision that is appropriate to the assessment and then update the decision as needed. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 131 Remember that many safety factors include the caveat that a certain condition or behavior (substance abuse, violence, etc.) suggests that the child is in immediate danger of serious harm. In most situations, you need to associate th at concern for potential serious harm with the impact or potential impact on the child. When a child is removed, documentation of the safety decision is critical . The Agency must provide a legal basis for this decision and therefore, it is your responsibility to delineate why removal was the best possible option. As noted above, even when you have not located some or all of the family, the safety assessment must be completed within 24 hours of receipt of the Hotline call. At times, the safety decision will indicate that there are potentially immediate safety factors and that a child has not been able to be accessed. You must c learly indicate additional next steps to locate and assess the child , including possible legal action. SAFETY PLANNING AND INTERVENTIONS There will be times during the course of investigating allegations of abuse and neglect that you will find safety concerns for a child. The information p resented below will assist you in determining when and how you can create a safety plan. Within a safety plan, specific actions will be outlined, and the parent or caregiver will be held accountable for the fulfillment of those actions to protect the child in the home. In the event that a \"sign of present danger\" puts the child at risk for imminent harm by a caregiver, this section will discuss all of your options for safety planning. As the CPS investigator, y ou must always address immediate concerns of serious harm to a child. But since no case circumstance is exactly alike, it is critical for the well -being of the child and the family that you tailor the intervention and the safety plan to the individual circumstances. Safety decisions must always be discussed with your direct supervisor or member of your management team. If you become involved in a situation in which a child may be in immediate danger you must contact your management team for consultation prior to leaving the scene, unless your own ph ysical safety is in jeopardy. When a child is left in a potentially unsafe situation, even for a short period of time, most importantly it does not protect the child. It also sends a mixed message about the exact severity of the safety concern and may allo w for the child's whereabouts to become unknown or be taken out of the jurisdiction. REMINDER: All safety interventions must be clearly documented in FACES.NET on the Safety Assessment Screen and in the contact notes. Please remember that a \"sign of pr esent danger\" does not automatically mean that a child must be removed from the home. It does mean , however, that you must ensure that the sign of present danger is mitigated, and that the child is safe. CFSA has specific practice guidelines regarding saf ety planning with caregivers. The primary consideration is to ensure the safety of the children . We must also balance the rights of the father and mother, or other caregivers. If CFSA has determined that a caregiver is \"unsafe\", the caregiver cannot make a safety plan for the child. One or more of the following several reasons may also prevent participation of the father, mother, or other caregiver : FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 132 Lack of court involvement may prevent safety planning because without it, the Agency can not exert legal aut hority for telling a caregiver where their child must live or stay. Part of safety planning is the ability to dictate certain restrictions for the child's living environment . Once a caregiver has already created an unsafe situation for the child, it is pre sumed that the caregiver will not, cannot, or may not make a safe and appropriate decision for the child's care. If the Agency cannot for whatever reason ensure long -term follow -up to the plan, services to support the plan, and/or the future safety of the child, it will not include the caregiver in safety planning. Determinations of an \"Unsafe\" Parent or Caregiver The first decision you must make when determining whether the parent is \"safe\" or \"unsafe\" for involvement in the safety planning process is whe ther or not the child is or would be in danger while under the direct care of the parent. Please refer to the safety planning template under Appendix IV: CPS Supporting Documentation . When you make such determinations, you must be aware that there are cert ain situations in which a parent may be a safe caregiver for one child but for not another (e.g., when one child has been physically abused but other children are not similarly situated and therefore not in danger). The following examples apply to caregive rs who have been deemed as \"unsafe\" and are therefore not considered appropriate for involvement in the safety planning process: The child's caregiver is determined to be the direct cause of imminent danger to that child. In this situation, the child may n eed to be removed. In any case, the caregiver is not involved in creating a safety plan to prevent removal. There is a lack of lucid reasoning on the part of the caregiver. Causes may include drug use, alcohol use, and mental health concerns. In those sit uations, if there are imminent safety concerns, a removal must occur. The parent has been arrested and is therefore \"unable\" to care for their child, thus creating a sign of present danger. If a caregiver is arrested for any crime related to child safety o r crimes against children, they are not considered a safe caregiver. These crimes may include (but are not limited to) any of the following charges: Child cruelty charge (e.g., first, second or third-degree charges or attempted assault) Simple assault on t he child Domestic dispute in which the child is injured or exposed Any other arrest related to child abuse or neglect (such as driving a car with a child who is not placed in a proper safety seat) Other crimes that would not inherently constitute a threat to a child's safety may cause a safety concern due to the situation . For example, driving under the influence would not immediately warrant safety concern for children but it would constitute a safety concern if the children were in the car. Another exampl e would be p ossession with intent to d istribute drugs in the presence of the children or in the home where the children normally reside. There may be exceptions to this general rule, such as when the arrest is related to only one child and the other child ren are therefore not considered to be in danger. In these situations, you should consult with your management team and CFSA's legal department regarding whether safety plans can be put into place with the parent's participation. There will also be situati ons during your investigations when a parent is not arrested but you believe that the child would not be safe to remain with the caregiver, based on your assessment. This might be a situation where the caregiver has physically or sexually abused the child, or the parent has failed to protect the child, or a neglect concern has put the child in immediate FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 133 danger of serious harm. In any of these situations, if the child is believed to be unsafe and no safety plan can be put into place, then the child should be removed . Your decision regarding safety planning may be different when there is another parent or caregiver for that child, who may or may not live in the home. When assessing whether the other parent or legal guardian can provide care, one of the determ inations that should be made is whether that parent or legal guardian is a legal parent or guardian , i.e., their parental rights are intact , or the court order is still valid. In the case of a parent , you want to ensure that their name is on the child's bi rth certificate . In the case of a legal guardian, you want to ensure that they have been legally determined to be the legal guardian in court. You must fully assess the individual to determine if the children would be safe in their care. This assessment m ust include all aspects of child safety. This MUST also include an assessment of their knowledge of the abuse or neglect allegation that was reported to have occurred in the home of the other caregiver. Note : A caregiver who has knowledge of abuse or neg lect but who does not take action to remediate the abuse or neglect is not an appropriate caregiver for safety planning purposes. If you determine that the other parent or legal guardian is not a safe and appropriate caregiver, you should explain to them that they will be assigned an attorney at the initial hearing, that they should attend, and that they can discuss custody with their attorney. REMINDER: If you decide that a child must be removed, you cannot place a child with an unlicensed caregiver . If there is a friend or family member who is a licensed foster caregiver, you may consider placing a child with them provided that the foster placement is available and the Placement Services Administration has authorized the placement. Sometimes, during a pre-removal Family Team Meeting (FTM), the family will attempt to create a plan for the child to reside with another individual. Again, no child can be placed with an unlicensed caregiver . The proposed caregiver must apply for licensing as a temporary foster care provider. The caregiver from whom the child has been removed can no longer make a plan. Determinations of a \"Safe\" Parent or Caregiver Even when arrests are involved, a caregiver may be considered safe if the crimes are not related to child safety (e.g., driving with a suspended license, use of drugs outside of the home, or failure to pay moving violations and parking tickets). Generally, these caregivers can plan for their child 's safety at the time of their arrest. If, however, the Agency has current involvement with the family (either an open investigation or a n open case), then CFSA must ensure that the caregiver(s) home environment where the child will be going is appropriate. If it is not, the child can and should be removed. If there is a sec ondary caregiver in the home, you must assess that person's role in caring for the children PRIOR to the event that resulted in the arrest or unsafe situation. If that person is found to be acting in loco parentis, it is possible that the secondary caregiv er can take responsibility for the children. You must assess to see if the secondary caregiver is appropriate. Both the primary and secondary caregivers MUST be in agreement with the secondary caregiver caring for the children. You must also consider the l ength of time that the secondary caregiver would conceivably be assuming parental responsibilities and determine whether this affects the appropriateness of the plan. In order to participate in the safety planning process , the caregiver must not be subje ct to any of the \"unsafe\" descriptions listed earlier in this section. For example, if the primary or secondary caregiver is not lucid and therefore unable to agree to the plan, the plan cannot be made. The exception is if the FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 134 secondary caregiver is the bi ological or legal caregiver. Then, if that person is an appropriate and willing caregiver, the children may be left in their home. You must still assess whether the primary caregiver will return to the home, and whether the plan is appropriate. At times, you may assess a child to be safe with their parent but both the parent and you believe that an intervention for the child will improve their well -being. At those times, the parent may want to safety plan for the child to stay with a relative or at a commu nity agency. These situations allow for the parent and child to \"take a break\" from internal family stressors. Because you believe that the child is safe to remain with their parent , the parent is allowed to plan, and you can assist with the planning. At other times, you may assess that a child is not safe in their home environment, but would be safe with the ir caregiver outside of the home environment. Examples of this might be a home that is in a deplorable condition or does not have utilities. Even thou gh there may be neglect occurring because a parent has failed to pay utilities or failed to ensure a clean home environment, the child is not in danger with their parent. T he parent can plan for themselves and their children to move to a safe location. Other Factors to Consider When determining if a safety plan can be created with a family, there are other factors to consider : Does the family ha ve a prior history with CFSA or another jurisdiction 's child welfare agency ? If the family does have prior histor y, and safety plans or interventions have been put into place in the past, you need to determine if it is appropriate to continue safety planning or if the child needs to be removed. Is the parent cooperative? Does the parent acknowledge the safety concern s and admit responsibility ? Is the child fearful o f remaining in the home? Is the parent capable of following the safety plan? If the parent is a chronic substance abuser , for example, or has significant mental health concerns, even if they are lucid at t he time you create the safety plan with them, they may not be able to follow the plan for any period of time. Is there a reason to believe that due to Agency involvement, the child would be in danger if left in the home? In some cases, parents become angr y because their child has disclosed information related to abuse or neglect. Even with a safety plan, when CFSA has left the home, the parent might be very angry and harm the child . Remediating Neglect with Safety Plans In many cases, neglect concerns can be remediated by the provision of resources and services. The following list offers ways in which causes of neglect can be remedied through a safety plan with the family to avoid removal and to protect the child. This list is not exhaustive and should be used only as a guide. Special Note: There may be times when the following interventions are not appropriate. For example, an intervention may have been put into place in the past but was not effective on a long -term basis. You must use your clinical judg ment along with input from your management team to determine if these interven tions should be implemented. Such determinations do not conclude the disposition of the allegation. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 135 Neglect Allegation Possible Plans or Service Provision Other Consideration s Inadequate Food Grocery vouchers, food bank information, budgeting How often does this happen? Is it due to poor budgeting? Do the parents have limited income ? Are they not receiving assistance? Is the parent using their money or food stamps to buy alcohol, drugs , or other non -necessity items ? Inadequate Shelter (e.g., deplorable housing) Homemaker services, family will stay in a shelter or hotel Is the poor housing condition the fault of the parent or the landlord? Does the parent make efforts to ensur e appropriate housing? Medical Neglect Immediate medical care What is the reason for the neglect? Exposure to Criminal Activity Notif ication to law enforcement Is the parent committing the crime? Is there someone else in the home? Does the home belong t o someone else? WRITTEN SAFETY PLANNING A safety plan must be written and consist of the following sections: The names of the children who are at risk due to the unsafe situation. Description of the unsafe situation - Please note: some caregivers will h ave difficulty signing a document that indicates they may have caused their child to be unsafe. You should write in this section that there are allegations that are in the process of being investigated. List of responsibilities for the caregiver - For example, \"refrain from using physical discipline\" or \"clean up the home within 3 days\" and \"move cleaning products to a shelf out of a child's reach ,\" etc. List of responsibilities for CFSA, e.g., provide referrals to parenting classes and therapy services. Consequences for failure to follow the safety plan, e.g., possible removal of the children. An agreement from any person involved in the child's care regarding the plan. Signatures , including the CPS investigat ive social worker , all caregivers, and the assig ned CPS supervisor (upon return to the office). Overall time frame for the safety plan, e.g., alleged perpetrator must leave the home until the investigation is complete. Please see Appendix IV: CPS Supporting Documentation for the general safety plan tem plate and a safety plan template specific to child sexual activity . Previous ly created forms must be discarded ! Each written safety plan must be customized for the family at hand. Supervisory Approval of the Safety Plan Once you have developed the written safety plan with the parent's or caregiver's full participation, you should meet with your supervisor to review the plan. Upon approval, the supervisor shall sign the plan and the original will be placed in the official hard copy case file. A copy of the plan should be given to the family. Reminder: you are required to receive supervisory approval. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 136 THE DISPOSITION DECISION One of the most important decisions you will ever make as a CPS social worker is the decision regarding the reported allegation and any other allegations unco vered during your investigation. The following information will inform the basis of your determination and MUST be documented clearly in FACES.NET in order to justify your disposition : o Child's statements o Maltreater 's statements o Collateral statements o Physical evidence o Medical findings o Records or reports After the completion of a thorough investigation that includes the assessment procedures, you must then determine only one of three possible disposition decisions for each allegati on and for each child, individually : o Substantiated o Inconclusive o Unfounded Substantiated -You must substantiate an allegation if there is evidence to believe it occurred. The D.C. Official Code \u00a7 4-1301.02(19A) defines a substantiated repor t as a \"report made which is supported by credible evidence and is not against the weight of the evidence.\" Reminder: You may use credible information obtained during the investigation even if you yourself do not observe the maltreatment, e.g., a credible mandated reporter informed you that the child had an injury or a parent was observed punching the child. Inconclusive -The disposition of an allegation should be Inconclusive if there is insufficient credible evidence to substantiate, however, there is s ome or conflicting information to indicate that the abuse or neglect may have occurred. An inconclusive report is a report that \"cannot be proven to be either substantiated or unfounded.\" D.C. Official Code \u00a7 4-1301.02(13A) Unfounded -An allegation should be unfounded if there is insufficient credible evidence to believe that abuse or neglect has occurred. D.C. Official Code \u00a7 4-1301.02(20A) defines an unfounded report as a report that \"is made maliciously or in bad fa ith or which has no basis in fact.\" The decision to substantiate allegations depends on the answer to this main question: Is there sufficient credible evidence to support the disposition of child maltreatment? Note: Credible Evidence means \"any evidence that indicates that a child is an abused or neglected child, including the statement of any person worthy of belief.\" D.C. Official Code \u00a7 4-1301.02(5) . There is sufficient credible evidence when the evidence more clearly and more probably favors one side than the other. This balancing test is the same one used by both the Family Court and at a Fair Hearing. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 137 Considerations At times, situations may be resolved during the course of an investigation, either due to a father or mother making changes or due to CFSA's interventions. You must determine whether the allegation that was reported should be substantiated b ased on the evidence of whether the neglect or abuse occurred, or based on whether it was occurring prior to CFSA involvement. Just because the neglect or abuse has been remediated, it does not mean that the disposition should be unfounded. Special Note: The disposition is ultimately considered an Agency decision, not an individual social worker's decision. Your management team must approve the disposition decision. You may also seek CFSA OGC -OGC assistance after conferring with your management team. You must practice with consistency. As noted above, disposition decisions are based on facts and not your emotional response to the situation. There was at one point a historical option for CPS to \"warn and counsel\" a caregiver who had abused or neglected a c hild if the matter appeared to be isolated or the caregiver was remorseful or the finding could have impacted the caregiver's employment. This option does not exist any longer . If the facts of a case warrant substantiation, then your decision must be consi stent with the guidelines in this POM for dispositions. Remember that all caregivers who are subject to an inconclusive or substantiated finding against them have the option of requesting a Fair Hearing. You must send the standard paperwork for this proce ss at the conclusion of your investigation; place a copy of the Notice of Action letter in the file and document in FACES.NET (Contacts Screen) that this paperwork has been sent to the caregiver. Failure to do so may result in the caregiver's name being re moved from the CPR due to lack of notification. The ramifications of such an omission must not lead to future abuse or neglect due to an investigative social worker's failure to document! All disposition decisions must be entered into FACES.NET under the Assessment Findings S creen . The Results tab is used to note any changes made to dispositions and the results of a fair hearing. The Results tab should only be used by social workers to document (via check box) if the investigation was a joint investigation and whether criminal proceedings have been initiated. STRUCTURED DECISION MAKING (SDM) RISK ASSESSMENT Risk is the likelihood that a child may be abused or maltreated in the future. The SDM ris k assessment tool assesses families for low, moderate, high, or intensive probabilities of future abuse and neglect. These risk levels , along with your clinical judgment and the disposition decision, will guide your decision whether or not to open a case, whether to refer the family to a collaborative, or whether to close an investigation with no further services. The risk assessment must be completed toward the end of the investigation and within 30 days from the receipt of the report at the Hotline . It is based upon a full assessment of the family and thorough knowledge of the strengths and challenges therein. Note: The risk assessment must be completed on the household that is the primary residence of the child. If the alleged maltreater resides in a different household but continues to function as a caregiver and is entitled and obligated to provide for the safety and well -being of a child, a risk assessment on that household should also be completed. If the child is a member of two households, and both caregiver s are identified as alleged perpetrators, a separ ate family risk assessment must be completed for each household. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 138 The risk assessment must be clearl y documented in FACES.NET on the Risk Assessment Screens. Your overall documentation should address the prominent risk concerns and any needed services. Th ere are three distinct parts of the risk assessment. All of them must be completed. Remember : You must create your household(s) in order to be able to complete the risk assessment. Risk Assessment Screen Document all answers to all questions utilizing the help tool to clarify definitions in each category . You should be very familiar with the definitions for each multiple choice question in order to accurately assess the risk level. Assessment Narrative Document \"Risk Factors \" in a list format, including those identified on the Risk Assessment Screen and others. Document family strengths, as appropriate. Document the family's support system, including fathers and mothers , known relatives, and other \"kin.\" This should include the type of support they provid e. Document the overall level of risk. Conclusion The \"Conclusion\" is n ot accessible until all questions on the risk assessment have been answered and the narrative assessment completed. Document whether or not overrides are applicable. If a discretionary override is selected, the final risk level will change to one level higher than the scored risk level. Note : If a discretionary override is selected, you must explain why the discretionary override is appropriate. Request the approval from your supervisor . A sample list of risk factors is provided for you on the following page. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 139 RISK FACTORS Child Risk Factors Premature birth Positive toxicology or exposur e in utero Birth anomalies Low birth weight Temperament (e.g., difficult or slow to warm up ) Physical/cognitive/emotional disability Chronic or serious illness Childhood trauma Mental health concerns Age Behavior problems Special needs Parental/Family Risk Factors Personality factors External locus of control Poor impulse control Depression/ anxiety Low tolerance for frustration Feelings of insecurity Lack of trust Insecure attachment with own parents Childhood history of abuse High parental conflict, domestic violence Family structure - single parent with lack of support, high number of children in household Social isolation, lack of support Parental psychopathology Substance abuse (past or present) Separation/ divorce, especially high -conflict divorce Age Number of children High stress level Poor parent -child interaction, negative a ttitudes and attributions about child's behavior Inaccurate knowledge and expectations about child development Social/Environmental Risk Factors Low socioeconomic status Stressful life events Lack of access to medical care, health insurance, adequate child care, or other services Parental unemployment Homelessness Social isolation/ lack of social support Exposure to racism/d iscrimination Poor schools Exposure to environmental toxins Dangerous and v iolent neighborhood Community violence FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 140 SERVIC E PROVISION Every family with an open investigation should be offered services. These services may include rehabilitative services, referrals to the Collaboratives, or other community -based services. In some cases, the service may be foster care, if the ch ildren are found to be in imminent danger and cannot remain safely in their homes. The information that you obtain in your investigation will guide your decision -making for service provision for the children and the family. Remember: CPS provides services to protect children from the immediate danger of serious harm, and to reduce risk and resolve identified problems and underlying conditions that create risk. The risk level and disposition of allegations determines how and where families can and do receiv e services. You should make every effort to initiate services that will help protect the children as soon as possible or at least within the 30 -day investigation timeframe. You must ensure that the referrals were received by the appropriate agency and t hat there has been outreach to the families. If your clinical judgment determines that additional or different services would benefit the family, you should explore those services with the family and with your management team. If the family chooses not to accept services (assuming that they have that option - see below), then you do not have to provide additional services. Referrals to the Collaboratives are encouraged as appropriate to meet the needs of the child and family, and to maintain safety while reducing risk. Note: The federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) requires that we refer children ages 0 to 3 for early intervention screening if they have been subjects of a substantiated investigation. Within 72 hours of the disposit ion, you must refer such children to CFSA's Clinical Health Services Administration for this referral to Child Find under the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) - Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities Division. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 141 Case Management Health y Families/Thriving Communities (HFTC) Collaborative Referrals You can submit a referral to the HFTC Collaborative s at any point during the course of the investigation. The se referrals can be made regardless of whether the allegations a re unfounded or substantiated. To refer a client to the Collaborative, please have the family sign a Release of Information form, then fill out the Collaborative Referral form, complete the risk assessment and submit this as a packet to the Collaborative Liaison. Agency Cases When you have a risk level that is high and the case is substantiated, you need to generate an open case with CFSA. If the risk is high and the allegations are unfounded, you must offer supportive services to the family but just r emember that these services are voluntary . No family is required to accept the offer for services. You must still document the offer of services and the family's response in writing. If you still believe that the family could benefit from the C ollaborati ves' services, you may also advise the family that they can seek help from the Collaborative on a walk -in basis. Emergency Services Collaborative Referrals Again, you can submit a referral to the Collaborative s at any point during the course of the investigation. The se referrals can be made regardless of whether the allegations are unfounded or substantiated. Note : You cannot refer a case to the Collaborative if the SDM level is high . As noted above, t o refer a client to the Collaborative, please have the family sign a Release of Information form, then fill out the Collaborative Referral form, complete the risk assessment and submit this as a packet to the Office of Community Services. At-Risk (Pre-Removal) FTM The At -Risk FTM is designed to assist the family in making a family plan that will resolve cris es and prevent the removal of the children. The At -Risk FTM also allows various family members to express their concern s and with the help of the facilitator and CFSA social worker, come up with a p lan to ensure the safety of the children and the stabilization of the family. A referral for an At -Risk FTM should be made at the onset of the investigation, with the exception of item #2 below. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 142 EXPANDED AT -RISK (PRE -REMOVAL)FTM CRITERIA 1. Social worker and supervisor clinical judgment 2. Intensive SDM risk cases opening for ongoing Agency services 3. Community -papered cases 4. Failure to thrive 5. Positive toxicology investigations 6. Moms 21 years of age & younger with two or more children General Ref errals While conducting an investigation, you may encounter situations where the family is in need of emergency services and cannot wait until the case is re -assigned to an on-going unit. It is your responsibility to immediately address these needs through a referral of services. Remember : These are general considerations that may need to be addressed on a case -by-case basis. REPORTING AND RECORDING NEW ALLEGATIONS If in the course of your investigation you discover new allegations regarding the family y ou are investigating, follow the procedures below to ensure that proper reporting and recording has occurred. New neglect allegations may simply be added to your investigation and dispositioned during the course of your assessment. If there are new emerge ncy neglect allegations that occur outside your tour of duty, these should be elevated to the CPS Hotline for proper response. New physical abuse or sexual abuse allegations must be reported to the CPS Hotline regardless of the type or immediacy of the si tuation. This is because the Hotline is the conduit for reporting to the police and all physical and sexual allegations are forwarded to them through this official method. If in the course of your investigation you discover new allegations regarding a fam ily you are not investigating, follow proper mandated reporting procedures by contacting the CPS Hotline immediately. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 143 MANAGING REMOVALS FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 144 Reasonable Efforts -any activity that purposefully attempts to protect and preserve the in-home status of a child or a child's goal of reunification. Such efforts may include (but are not limited to) assessing imminent threats to the child's safety, developing alternative methods for in -home safety plans, and/or identifying people and resourc es to help prevent child placement. REASONABLE EFFORTS As a first course of action, you are required to make reasonable efforts to prevent the remov al of children from their families . It is important at this point to realize that District law does not specifically define reasonable efforts in regard to the prevention of a child's removal. D.C. Official Code \u00a7 4-1301.09a does, however, require the foll owing particulars to be considered: In determining and making reasonable efforts under this section, the child's safety and health shall be the paramount concern. Reasonable efforts shall be made to preserve and reunify the family by the Agency , although t here are a few exceptions where the parent has been convicted in a criminal court of a crime against a child or where a TPR has been granted concerning a sibling. See OAG -OGC immediately for such a determination or notify the OAG papering attorney if a re moval has occurred . These reasonable efforts shall be made prior to the removal of a child from the home in order to prevent or eliminate the need for removing the child, unless the provision of services would put the child in danger. If there is an immedi ate threat to the child's safety and well -being that necessitates removal from the home , CPS works closely with the Placement Services Administration to provide the most suitable and nurturing foster care environment available. Achieving safety, well -being , and permanency is the final goal for all children. When conducting an investigation of child abuse or neglect, you must assess whether any child who is at risk should be removed from the home or can be protected by making a referral for services or putting in services to ameliorate the abuse or neglect . REMOVAL DECISIONS The decision to remove a child from a caregiver is a profound change for a family. This decision must only occur after reasonable efforts have been made to keep the family in tact, unl ess the exigent circumstances negate the need to make such efforts, and a subsequent determination has been made that child vulnerabilities and safety concerns outweigh the protective capacities of the caregiver(s). All decisions to remove a child must be made in con sultation with your supervisor, who will also confer with their respective program manager, or the program manager on duty . In the likelihood that the removal decision is being made while you are in the physical presence of the child or childr en, you should not leave the scene . The very nature of a removal is stressful to all parties and certain potential exists for escalating tensions that may result in additional harm to the child. In many situations, it may be necessary to involve the police . An officer can serve as a witness to the circumstances of the removal as well as provide a level of stabilization. When to Consider an Emergency Removal D.C. Official Code \u00a7 16-2309 (a)(3) gives CFSA the authority to take a child into custody when we ha ve reasonable ground to believe that the child is in immediate danger from his or her surroundings and that the removal of the child from his or her surroundings is necessary. Keep in mind that the decision to remove is based on your clinical judgment, you r assessment of immediate danger of serious harm, and in consultation with your supervisor and program manager. As there are numerous circumstances FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 145 that can arise with families, this is not a prescriptive process. A number of varying situations exist tha t may result in immediate risks to children to justify their removal from the home. Child maltreatment comes in many different forms; therefore, each family situation must be assessed on a case -by-case basis. The following will provide some general gui dance concerning when to consider an emergency removal: The child is in a situation of immediate danger to their physical health or safety. The danger may come from any source, such as the child, another person, or the physical environment and there is no way to make a safety plan that will ensure child safety. Other options for protecting the child are ruled out. There is not a reasonable opportunity to obtain a court order. Again, you must consult with your supervisor and obtain supervisory and progra m approval prior to removing any child from their parent/caregiver. WORKING WITH CAREGIVERS DURING REMOVAL Engagement Treating clients with respect is particularly vital during the removal process . Even under the best of circumstances, a removal will undoubtedly be emotionally charged. As the CPS social worker, you are in a unique position for setting the tone for future cooperation between the caregiver and a team of other child welfare professionals. If the caregiver is physically present during the removal, it is important that you use engagement skills, and take appropriate opportunities to highlight the strengths of the family, in spite of the safety concerns. It is equally important that you clearly identify the reasons for removal and that you m ake efforts to explain the removal process to the caregiver(s) as much as possible. (If the caregiver is too tense for communication at the time of removal, information should be left with them , especially your contact information, and follow -up should occ ur in a timely manner to help the caregiver understand this critical process. ) Throughout the process, continue to build the foundation for a positive working relationship and when appropriate, reaffirm your ultimate goal to reunite the family. Remember: The primary goal in the removal process is always to secure the immediate safety of children and then, as soon as feasible, safely reunite the family. Only in the most severe situations and most likely rare circumstances where reasonable efforts to reunify are not required would a CPS social worker not strive initially to ultimately reunite the family. Legal Notification and Discussion All caregiver s should be provided with a written Notice to Appear in Family Court . This is a standard form (see Appendix IV: CPS Supporting Documentation ) that should be completed and signed by the CPS social worker. If a caregiver cannot be located (due to arrest, unknown whereabouts, etc.) this form should be left at the caregiver's residence. If the situation allows, you should make every effort to begin a discussion with the caregiver regarding the legal process for removal and reunification . In so doing, y ou must play the role of advocate to help the caregiver fully comprehend the importance of attending the initial he aring, paying attention, and FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 146 understanding their legal rights. At a minimum, the following procedures should be described: An attorney is provided to the caregiver or, if they are able, they can hire their own. The caregiver has an opportunity to request t hat the presiding judge hear their side of the events. Services are available to help their family . These services are voluntary and optional , unless Court ordered . The judge will make a decision about whether the removal was justified and whether the children should remain in shelter care. Family Team Meetings (FTM) All caregivers must receive the standard brochure on the Family Team Meeting process. When explaining or discussing the brochure with the caregiver(s), ask them if there are any potential rela tives who may serve as support. Relate any names and contact information to the FTM unit via the FTM referral ( see section on FACES.NET documentation below ). Be prepared to explain to families that you may not have the immediate ability to place children w ith family members. Children may only be placed by CFSA in licensed placements. If you are able to identify potential relative placement options and or other relative supports, the kinship care licensing process can commence the same day as the removal is occurring. Talking with the Caregiver about the Children and Obtaining Important Items The caregiver is always considered the expert on the child, even if he or she is facing child maltreatment allegations. If the caregiver is physically present during the removal process, try to learn as much as possible about the child's basic care: Name and contact information for the child's primary physician, including status of immunizations, specific health issues, and general health care. Determine if the child h as special needs (physical or emotional) and what implications these may have for the child's placement. Depending on the level of special need (wheelchair bound, medically fragile, etc.) you may need to make arrangements for appropriate transportation and care of the child. Confer with your management team in these situations. Obtain medication (if applicable) from the caregiver and give these to the medical professional who examines the child at the time of removal (see the section below on Medical Screen ing under Taking Children into Protective Custody ). If the caregiver refuses to provide medications, this should be documented. Obtain important paperwork (if possible) regarding the child, including the birth certificate, social security card, and health insurance card. Obtain information about the child's education, e.g., school enrollment, specialized services or programs (such as tutoring). Special Note: Keeping a child's routine in place is one very specific way to reduce additional trauma as the child adjusts to the removal. Specifically, this includes keeping the child enrolled in the school of origin. Obtain appropriate clothing for the child, if available. (If clothing is significantly deteriorated or otherwise unwearable , it should be left behind.) Find out if the school -age children wear uniforms or what the ir expected attire is. Endeavor to transport the clothing in an appropriate suitcase or other carrier. If clothing cannot be obtained at home, determine if any emergency clothing can be obtained through CFSA's Partners for Kids in Care or through requesting a CFSA clothing voucher. If the child was interviewed at the Children's Advocacy Center, the child may qualify for a few sets of clothing from that organization. Determine if the child has any special habits (e.g., a particular bedtime routine) or items (e.g., favorite toy or stuffed animal) that would help ease this transition. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 147 Legal Rights of Additional Caregivers If there are legal caregivers for a child from whom the child is not being rem oved, efforts should be made to locate these caregivers and assess their willingness and capacity to serve as advocates and nurturing caregiver figures. This may include absent caregiver s or caregivers with limited involvement. All biological parents and legal caregivers should be given notice to appear in Family C ourt if their whereabouts can be determined. When possible, this notification should be given prior to the initial hearing. After the initial hearing, the assigned Assistant Attorney General (AAG) will make arrangements to conduct a diligent search for parties of interest who will need notice of the court proceedings. Communications between the Caregiver and Child during the Removal Clinical judgment should be used when determining to what extent there should be communication (either in person or via telephone) during the removal process. Special Note : Unsupervised contact is to be avoided both for the best interests of the child and to protect the investigation process. This should be explained to all parties. Any discussion of the investigation at hand should also be avoided. Visitation At the initial hearing, the presiding judge will determine whether visitation between the caregiver(s) and children is appropriate and whether it should be super vised. As the CPS social worker who first assessed the family situation and engaged with the children and caregiver, you should be prepared to make a recommendation on this issue and to provide a supporting rationale. Note: Please refer to the Agency's Vis itation Policy for more information. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 148 TAKING CHILDREN INTO PROTECTIVE CUSTODY 1. Communicating with Children during Removal Use a soothing and appropriate voice to put the children at ease. Be genuine. Use vocabulary that is easy for the children to und erstand and define words, such as \"placement\" in simple terms. Help the children understand what is happening and why they are leaving the home, including the reason for placement (as appropriate). Recognize that some information is too complicated for you nger children . Make sure the children understand that emergency placement is not their fault and they are not being punished for anything. Describe step -by-step events that will occur throughout the placement process. Use engagement skills to encourage the children to express fears and concerns about placement, and then address them. Identify the names of the staff the children will encounter, their job functions, and possible questions the staff may ask children. Assure the children that their desire or la ck thereof to contact family members during the removal will be considered . Encourage children to bring personal belongings that can be helpful during the transition into care. 2. Medical Screening and Medico -Legal Examinations All children entering shelt er care must receive a medical screening prior to placement. This screening is coordinated through the Healthy Horizons Assessment Center (HHAC) located on the first floor of CFSA's headquarters. Some children will need to have a \"medico -legal\" examinati on, which is an examination specific to physical and sexual abuse. As noted throughout this document, CFSA's provider of choice for these examinations is the Child and Adolescent Protection Center (CAPC) within the Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) . The Emergency Department at CNMC is also an option. The physician completing this examination should make a written notation that the child is \"m edically cleared for placement.\" The paperwork should then be taken to HHAC to ensure that the child is enrol led. 3. Ongoing Medical Care HHAC will ensure that all children entering care are set up for their standard medical, dental, and vision appointments. As noted above, if a child is not medically screened at HHAC (e.g., in the case of medico -legals or child ren entering care directly from a hospital facility), they must still be enrolled in the HHAC program afterwards to ensure that they are set up for their ongoing medical care. 4. Mental Health If a child presents any current mental health distress ( e.g., the child is suicidal, homicidal, or psychotic) an immediate mental health assessment is required. Additionally, all children entering care, age 8 and over, must receive a mental health assessment from CFSA's Clinical Health Services Administration (CHSA) within 10 days of removal. A consult between CHSA and the child's caregiver must occur for any child under age 8. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 149 5. Children ages 0 -3 Children ages 0 -3 are in a state of high vulnerability in general but particularly during a removal process. Most of these children are not verbal and may not understand the removal process. For infants, critical bonding experiences can be disrupted during removal. Special assistance may be required. It is important that you make concerted efforts to determine the basic care needs of infants (feeding method, allergies or special care needs, etc.). Remember, CFSA is mandated to refer all children age s 0-3 through CHSA t o the District's 0 -3 Early Intervention Program. TEAMING WITH EXTENDED FAMILY AND SUPPORTS 1. Confiden tiality Remember: All CPS investigations are confidential. Conversations with the caregiver can help identify relatives or close friends who may be supportive, including professionals. It is important, however, that communications with these supports occur only with the proper releases of information or consent of the caregiver . Be prepared to explain the constraints of confidentiality to these supports so that they understand the role you play and they understand how to best interface with the Agency. 2. Placement with Relatives Your role is to identify potential relatives or non -blood related kin that may be willing and able to care for the children. As previously stated, be prepared to explain to families that you may not have the immediate ability to pl ace children with family members. Children may only reside in licensed placements. If you are able to identify potential relative placement options and or other relative supports, the kinship care process can commence the same day as the removal is occurri ng. Families can be linked with the CFSA Kinship Division to assist them through the licensing process. Families should understand that identified relatives or kin must be thoroughly assessed to determine the appropriateness of their interaction with t he children being removed from their home. This assessment includes whether the relatives can provid e suitable housing and the ability to pass criminal or child welfare background clearances. Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act o f 2008 The federal Fostering Connections law requires that child welfare agencies exercise due diligence to identify and provide notice to all adult grandparents and other adult relatives of a child within 30 days of a child's removal f rom home. CFSA r equires that within 30 days of a child's or youth's entry into foster care, the investigat ive social worker must use reasonable efforts to identify and locate any absent parent, all maternal and paternal grandparents, other relatives , and significant non -relatives who have a relationship with the child. The investigative social worker notif ies these adult relatives and significant non -relatives of the removal and provide s them with information regarding their custodial options. (Exceptions may be made due t o family or domestic violence.) As the CPS social worker, it is critical that you gather information as to adult relatives and significant non-relatives and thoroughly document this information in FACES.NET . This will allow CPS or the on - going social wor ker to notify relatives and explore them as placement resources when children enter foster care. This information should be obtained from the parent as soon as possible. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 150 3. Family Team Meeting (FTM) The FTM process is a formalized practice for involvin g family supports in the planning of the children's care. This is a collaborative effort and it is important that their opinions, concerns, recommendations, and suggestions are heard. As the CPS social worker, you need to be prepared to discuss the family' s safety and risk factors that you identified, and to ensure that these factors, both negative and positive, are addressed in the FTM process. THE PLACEMENT PROCESS Coordination Activities with CFSA's Placement Services Administration 1. The c all or co nversation with the Kinship Unit and Placement Services Administration (\"Placement\") Once a final determination has been made to remove a child from the home, you or your management team should contact the Kinship Unit and Placement to discuss the child's specific placement needs. Ideally you should have every child's full name, date of birth ( DOB), health needs, school information, and the reason for removal. This information will be included in the child's Placement Packet ( see #2 below ). Even if all of t his information is not immediately available, you must still contact Placement so that they can begin searching the best placement options. You can follow up with the additional information as soon as you receive it. Special Note : There will be times whe n you must conduct a removal under circumstances where the child is not actually living in the home (e.g., a legal removal for a child who needs to remain in a hospital setting). In these situations, you should still notify Kinship and Placement so that th ey can prepare for the child's release from the facility and subsequent entry into their best placement option. 2. Placement Packet All placement providers (or resource caregivers) receive a green P lacement Packet for every child in care. The packet inclu des the child's medical screening and demographic information. Additional packets can be obtained from Placement. TEAMING WITH PLACEMENT PROVIDERS 1. Discussion o n the r eason for the child's removal Resource caregiver s (i.e., foster parents) should be giv en as much pertinent information as possible about the child in their care, including the reason for removal. Relevant and detailed information, such as any known previous behav ioral issues or current concerns , helps the provider to address the child's individual situation and creates a good foundation for quality care. In the event that there are sensitive aspects of the investigation (e.g., criminal components that require increased levels of confidentiality) , discretion should be used regarding the exten t of information shared. 2. Discussions regarding individual children Since each child may naturally respond differently to placement, it is important that each child, including siblings, be discussed individually. Discussions with a placement provider s hould include distinguishing information about the individual child's concerns or fears, routines, comforts, etc. 3. Medical Care Medical care for each child should be established through the initial placement screening process. It is essential that any c oncerns resulting from that evaluation be shared with the placement provider so that the best care possible is available to the child. The placement provider should also be given any information related to special medical needs, upcoming appointments, and over the counter FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 151 medications that the child may take such as vitamins. Special Note : If the child takes prescription medications, you need to ensure that the prescriptions are filled prior to placement with the foster parent . If a child is being discharg ed from a hospital or has specialized medical needs the placement provider must be included in conversations with medical professionals to ensure adequate preparation for the care of the child. 4. Transportation and Education As stated earlier, maintainin g a child in his or her school placement is a priority during removal. This upholds an aspect of normalcy for the child and can mitigate the profound adjustments that must be made after removal and placement. Special Note: You should consult with your mana gement team in the event that the child's normal school placement is determined to be detrimental to the child's best interests (e.g., if the child reports being uncomfortable at his/her school as a result of the removal and placement, or if there is a pot ential danger to the child due to caregiver access ). Although placement providers are charged with ensuring that children are transported to school, this may not always be practical or possible. During the initial placement process, you should make every effort to explore and facilitate other transportation options. For children who have special needs and already receive school busing, transportation arrangements can be transferred directly to the placement provider. For other children in need of transpor tation services, please contact the CFSA's educational specialist for assistance. FACES.NET DOCUMENTATION AND GENERAL PAPERWORK 1. Safety Assessment and Case Connect in FACES.NET Your determination for removal must be entered into FACES.NET under \" Safety Decision #4\" on the Safety Assessment Screen. Once this decision is selected and approved, you will be allowed to complete the case connect and formally open the Agency 's case. 2.

The forms need to be signed by your supervisor and then submitted to the CFSA Eligibility Department. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 153 FACES.NET DOCUMENTATION OF INVESTIGATI ONS FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 154 DOCUMENTATION OF INVESTIGATIONS The integrity of the investigative process is preserved only by thorough, accurate, and clear documentation of every pertinent social work activity that directly impacts the investigation assigned to you. Your documen tation must also include the rationale behind each activity. These written notations protect the safety and well -being of the children being served by the Agency while also protect ing you as an agent of the Agency, as well as protecting the Agency itself. When you hold yourself professionally and personally accountable for proper documentation, you not only fulfill your obligations to the children and families of the District of Columbia, you also get the credit you deserve for your hard work. The guidel ines highlighted below will help you achieve the level of quality documentation that is expected of all CPS social workers. MANDATES ALL investigation activities must be accurately and clearly documented in FACES.NET within 24 hours of their occurrence . It is especially critical to document initial contacts with the family and the safety assessment within 24 hours of receipt of the investigation. If you are not able to locate a child or a family, this also must be included in the documentation. It is N EVER acceptable for there to be more than 1 week that passes without updated investigation activity and documentation. REMEMBER: if it is not entered in FACES.NET , it didn't happen! This includes documentation that may be in some other form (Microsoft wor d, email, etc.). Without entry into the appropriate FACES.NET screen you will not receive credit for the good work you have done! PURPOSE Accurate and detailed documentation guides the CPS process ; provides a detailed account of the allegations and the i nvestigation outcome ; demonstrates accountability on the part of CFSA and the social worker ; guarantees facts to support any legal action that might be necessary ; and provides an efficient means for supervisory review and statistical reporting.

Consider document ing other contacts or consultations with the following groups that are relevant to the overall investigation or disp osition : Providers Relatives Other individuals Office of the Attorney General and an Assistant Attorney General SAFETY PLANNING Summarize any safety planning that occurred in the investigation and any ongoing safety planning needed. DISPOSITION Based on the investigation conducted by this worker, it is determined that the allegation of (abuse or neglect) is (substantiated, inconclusive, or unfounded) . Include one or two sentences explaining the reason for each disposition. RISK AND SERVICE PROVISION Document one of the following recommendations for opening or not opening a case at the closure of an investigation ( see section on Disposition Decisions ): Unfounded or inconclusive disposition - no case opened. Unfounded or inconclusive disposition with high or intensive risk AND signed consent from the family - open (or re -open) case for voluntary services and transfer to In -Home and Permanency Administration. Substantiated disposition with safety concerns or with high or intensive risk - open (or re -open) case for supportive services and transfer to In -Home and Permanency Administration. Substantiated disposition without safety concerns and low or moderate risk , or substantiated disposition with a family residing outside the jurisdiction or other reason for closure at the CPS level - case opened but closed at CPS with a referral to the Collaboratives. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 160 NOTIFICATION OF DISPOSITION Within 7 days of the disposition, you are required to send a Letter of Notification of Disposition and Right to Fair Hearing Form to the individual identified as the maltreater in the report. For your own protection and for the integrity of the investigation process, you must clearly document in FACES.NET and in your case notes that this notification was provided. Be sure to include the exact date of notification . A copy of the letter must be put in the hard file, if applicable . The Assessment Finding Screen in FACES.NET is used to document the disposition of each allegation for each maltreater, to indicate outcome ( e.g., opening a case, sending to the collaborative), and to provide details regarding why the disposition was made. This information populates to the Notification of Investigation Results , which is then sent to each alleged maltreate r. To complete the screen, you must d o the following: Complete each allegation by selecting substantiated , unfounded, or inconclusive . Pick a case -opening decision for each alleged perpetrator. Write a clear and concise statement for all allegations in the text box below the case decision . This statement provide s the reason for the disposition for each allegation for each maltreater. The information will be read by the caregiver and should inform them in a few sentences of the general reason for the finding. Only include the initials for the children. Write as if you are speaking directly with the perpetrator. INCOMPLETE INVESTIGATIONS Generally speaking, all investigations should be closed as complete, meaning that all standard investigation components have been completed (please see the Investigations section for detail). At times there will be legitimate reasons that your investigation may not be complete. When you have an incomplete investigation, it requires the consent of the PM to close. Some examples of these are outlined below: Investigations on open Agency cases When a family is already known to CFSA through an open Agency case, the response to the allegation assessment does not change. Since there is already an ongoing social worker assigned to the family, standard medical and edu cational contacts are not required for these investigations, unless they are pertinent to the specific allegations in the CPS investigation. Investigations of intra -familial sexual abuse with no allegations against the parent s or caregivers CPS accepts all allegations of intra -familial sexual abuse for investigation even when there are no allegations against the actual caregivers for the victim children. In these instances the investigative social worker is conducting an assessment around the allegations bu t is not required to obtain standard medical and educational collateral information unless this information is pertinent to the allegations. Jurisdictional issues o Allegations occurred here but family lives outside jurisdiction In these instances you must d isposition the allegation even if you are not be able to complete a full investigation (such as a home assessment or certain collateral contacts) due to jurisdictional issues. These situations still need a disposition. o Family lives here but allegation occu rred outside jurisdiction FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 161 At times the CPS Hotline will accept an allegation that, in the course of investigation, is determined to have occurred outside of the District. In these instances you may not be able to disposition the allegation. You must still assess for any safety or services issues that could be occurring within our jurisdiction. Additionally, if a child is physically in DC and in immediate danger, the Agency has the authority to take immediate custody of the child to ensure their safety, if n eeded. Investigations where the client refuses to cooperate In general you may not close an investigation simply because a client is uncooperative. In rare instances, you will have exhausted all reasonable efforts to complete a full investigation and not have sufficient safety reasons to continue pursuing any outstanding tasks on the investigation. A decision to close an incomplete investigation for this reason is only made in conjunction with the CPS management team and with the Office of the General Couns el. False reports An investigation may only be closed as a false report if the reporter admits to the information being false. Reminder: a false report is distinguished from an unfounded report in that false reports are proven to have been made in bad fait h, whereas an unfounded allegation is simply determined to be untrue after a CPS investigation. Investigations involving additional information only At times the CPS Hotline may accept a referral that, after investigation begins, is determined to have alre ady been investigated. In these instances, the matter does not need to be re - investigated and can be closed as \"additional information only.\" Diplomatic Immunity Again, these investigations are closed as incomplete. The text of the letter to the U.S. Stat e Department should be copied and pasted into FACES. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 162 CONFERENCES AND CONSULTATIONS FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 163 Clinical Health Services Administration (CHSA) Specialists within CHSA are a resource for consultation on common family dynamics involved in CPS investigations i ncluding substance abuse, domestic violence, medical care, mental health, and education. In many instances referrals to the various specialists in this administration are required (see Allegation -Specific Investigation Steps ) but in many more situations, t he personnel in CHSA are available to provide counsel and guidance in the above -mentioned areas. LEGAL During the course of an investigation, consultation between CPS staff and CFSA's legal team safely ensures that CPS dispositions and actions are within the guidelines of federal and District rules and regulations. Consultations may include (but are not limited to) advice on testimony from CPS staff, opinions on certain steps to achieve the successful closure of a referral, and the propriety of requests for information and documentation from caregiver s, lawyers and judges. If the matter has been petitioned, is soon to be petitioned or there is a question about whether there is sufficient evidence to petition, the consultation should be with the Office of th e Attorney General, Family Services Division Child Protection Section (the attorneys who represent CFSA in court). If the matter is not a court case (most in -home cases) and the matter is not a current investigation or family assessment where removal or community papering is being considered then the consultation should be with the Office of the Attorney General, Child and Family Services Agency Office of the General Counsel. DILIGENT SEARCH When you have made reasonable but unsuccessful efforts to lo cate family members during the CPS investigation, a diligent search referral may be submitted to CFSA's Diligent Search Unit (DSU). ( For more detailed information on the DSU referral, please see the CFSA Diligent Search Policy, located on both the interne t and intranet.) In order to comply with DSU requirements, you must follow the procedures outlined below: o Ensure that you have documented all efforts to locate the person being sought and that you have entered the results of the search in FACES.NET , including when, where , and how attempts were made to identify and locate the missing person. o If you are still unable to locate the person being sought, consult with your supervisor to determine whether the search is complete. Your supervisor will determine w hether further action is required, or whether you need to refer the case to the DSU. If your supervisor determines that the case should be referred to the DSU, complete a Diligent Search Locator Referral form (see Appendix IV: CPS Supporting Documentation ), and submit it to your supervisor for review and signature. Once your supervisor has approved and signed the form, you should hand deliver the form to the DSU supervisor or fax it to 202 -727-8884. o DSU investigations are completed within 5 business days of receipt of the referral. At that time, you will receive a Diligent Search Referral Investigation Report (DSRIR) that summarizes the results of the search. The report will identify all potential leads that may assist you in locating the person being soug ht. If you have not received a DSRI R after 5 business days then contact the diligent search supervisor. o You are expected to follow up on any leads provided by the DSU investigator. o Once you have exhausted all leads provided by the DSU investigator, con sult with your supervisor to determine whether further action is required or whether the search is complete. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 164 OUTSIDE JURISDICTIONS As noted earlier, a ny allegation of abuse or neglect occurring in the District must be investigated, even if the family liv es in another jurisdiction. Under such circumstances, you will need to confer with the other jurisdiction's CPS unit in order to conduct a full investigation or complete a safety check. You may need to request a history of the family's involvement with tha t jurisdiction , or schedule interviews with various family members or make a home visit to the jurisdiction. At times, other jurisdictions will request information from CFSA , or interviews to be conducted that the CFSA Hotline reporter will record in the f orm of an I&R (Information and Referral Report). If confirmation is received that the family in question does not live in the District and the allegations did not occur in the District , then you should place a call to the appropriate jurisdiction and refe r the allegations for investigation accordingly. Please make sure that you thoroughly document such information and referrals. MULTI -DISCIPLINARY TEAM MEETINGS As an employee of the Child and Family Services Agency, you are a part of the multi -disciplina ry team (MDT) charged with the responsibility of investigating and prosecuting child maltreatment in the District of Columbia. You may be expected to participate in joint training with MDT members. The following groups are involved with MDT membership : Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) Safe Shores Children's Advocacy Center (CAC) Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) Office of the Attorney General - Family Services Division, Child Protection Section (OAG - Neglect) Office of the Attorney General - Public Safety Division, Juvenile Section (OAG -Juvenile) United States Attorney's Office In order to create the most coherent and effective use of MDT, and to facilitate communication amongst all MDT members, the following meetings are purposefully scheduled: Pre/Post Conferences for CAC Interviews You should plan to arrive 20 minutes prior to scheduled CAC interviews in order to participate in a facilitated pre -conference meeting. Please be prepared to share all information that is pertinent to the current alle gations, including family history with the Agency or any other information that may be useful to MDT's involvement with the investigation. After CAC interviews, MDT members may decide to hold a less formalized post -conference to discuss next steps, such as needed services, potential removal of a child, or civil or criminal prosecution. Physical Abuse Case Review These reviews are held twice monthly and typically include participation by the supervisor or a member of CFSA's Special Abuse management team . Please be aware that attendees may have questions or request updated information on the investigation. Communication will be facilitated by the representative from CPS management. Sexual abuse case review Sexual abuse case reviews are held on a biweekly b asis and typically include participation by the supervisor or a member of CFSA's Special Abuse management team . Please be aware that attendees FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 165 may have questions or request updated information on the investigation. Communication will be facilitated by the representative from CPS management. Special N ote: CPS staff may at times participate in less formal meetings to discuss specific investigations. CASE TRANSFER STAFFING Transfers for In -Home Services When allegations are substantiated and the SDM tool indicates a high or intensive level of risk, the case will be staffed and transferred to the In -Home and Permanency Administration. During this process, a case number will be generated and posted for staffing. Within 5 days of the posting, an on - going supe rvisor shall be assigned and the transfer staffing take place. As the CPS social worker, please expect to attend this transfer staffing . Additional participants will include your CPS supervisor, the assigned on -going supervisor, and the assigned on -going s ocial worker. (With the exception of positive toxicology cases, cases with a low -to-moderate risk level are referred to one of the six Healthy Families/Thriving Communities Collaborative offices, provided the caregiver consents to this referral.) The 7 -day visit CPS workers are required to see the caregiver and children within 7 business days prior to the posting of a case. The purpose of this visit is to ensure that the family remains stable and that the family is informed of the case transfer , as well as any expectations and the reason for substantiation. This visit should be conducted in the home if at all possible. If it is not possible for you to see all of the children in the home, school visits may be substituted as long as all individuals in the fam ily have been seen within the 7 business days. Transfers Involving Removals When a removal occurs, the Family Team Meeting is considered the case transfer staffing. As the CPS social worker, please attend the FTM . At this time, the hard case file is pro vided to the assigned on - going worker, who is also expected to be present. If for some reason, the FTM does not occur before the initial hearing, a regular staffing should occur within 2 days of the hearing. The case is transferred at that time. Again, as the CPS social worker, please attend this transfer staffing . Additional participants will include your CPS supervisor, the assigned on -going supervisor, and the assigned on -going social worker. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 166 SUPERVISORY AND MANAGERIAL OVERSIGHT FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 167 ACCOUNTABILITY CPS investigators rely upon supportive and accessible supervision to positively impact their productivity and engagement. If you have any questions regarding an investigation, including whether or not the facts presented in the investigation constitute ab use or neglect, you must seek guidance from your immediate or covering supervisor or program manager. Supervisors are held accountable for the following activities: 1. Weekly review of unit data, including the number of case assignments per worker and class of cases, all of which need to be scheduled in consideration of time management for both the supervisor and the CPS social worker 2. Review of investigations , content of FACES.NET documentation, case planning, and assessments for safety and risk 3. Weekly indiv idual supervision 4. Conferring (either via telephone or in person) with investigative staff on the same day as all initial assignments (whether immediate or regular response) to ensure that thorough and appropriate initial safety decisions have occurred and to discuss next steps 5. Within 48 hours the following tasks must have been completed: Review of FACES.NET contacts, notes, documentation, and approval of initial safety assessment Supervision notes and further directives entered into FACES.NET Program managers are held accountable for the following activities: 1. Weekly review of division data 2. Case reviews (specifically trends ), external issues, documentation provided by the supervisors 3. Division planning, schedules, overtime, workforce vacancies , and other personnel issues 4. Daily tracking of an investigation f rom day 18 through day 30 to ensure that the case is closed on time with the safety of the child or children intact (If there are barriers to timely closure, the program manager will immediately inform the CPS administrator in writing, detailing the reasons for the delay and the anticipated date of closure. ) WEEKLY SUPERVISION Weekly supervision is required for each investigation . Supervision notes must be entered in FACES.NET after each supervision m eeting. The following may be reviewed, and additional direction provided if necessary: Interviews of victims and other children Interviews of perpetrators Interview with reporting source Diligent search request and results Records request and results Evaluations Safety of the child Family risk Appropriate service levels Progress of investigation and report Disposition FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 168 Weekly supervision may also address ... Professional development Training Corrective counsel 18 DAY REVIEW The \"18 -Day Review\" process is a teaming opportunity held once a week for each CPS division to identify barriers and other issues that prevent proper closure of investigations that are 18 days or older. Team participants include CPS management (administrator, program managers, and supervi sors), other CFSA management, and personnel from the CFSA General Counsel's Office. Special Note : It is the responsibility of the assigned supervisor to present every referral that has been open in their unit for 18 days or more . Social workers may also be requested to provide updates for this meeting or, at times, to attend this meeting. During the review meetings, team participants will first make certain that the safety of every alleged child victim has been secured, and that every child has been indi vidually seen and interviewed. The team will further discuss additional phases of the CPS investigation process, including documentation of contacts, referrals that have been or need to be made and any other issues or barriers that impact the investigatio n. The review is not concluded without identification of the proper steps needed to complete the investigation process. Documentation in FACES.NET should reflect the Agency's quality improvement efforts . You MUST document the 18 -day review, along with wh atever recommendations were made and any follow -up that you completed. \"FOUR PLUS\" STAFFINGS The supervisor should take care to assess whether there is recidivism within families that are under investigation. Specifically, attention is paid to families w ho have had four or more investigations. A four plus (4+) staffing must be held on families receiving four or more reports of maltreatment, with the most recent occurring within the last 12 months, whether or not there is an open case, and whether there has been a case closed within the last 30 days of the new report. Following a FACES.NET search, if the supervisor identifies a family that meets this criterion, this information must be reported to the program manager right away, so that a 4+ staffing can be conducted. There will be at least four opportunities to conduct a 4+ staffing: If there is no open case, the 4+ Staffing may occur during the 18 -Day Review with CPS and others if determined there is a need. If there is an open case or a case closed within the last 30 days, the appropriate parties from the In- Home and Permanency Administration will be notified and alerted that a staffing will be conducted at the next 18 Day Review at a specific timeframe (based on the individual program manager 's schedule). If there is no open case, but a case will be opened as a result of the current investigation, the Case Transfer Staffing may be utilized to conduct the 4+ staffing. The Enhanced Grand Rounds will be a monthly forum to conduct the 4+ staffing. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 169 Subsequent to the staffing, the supervisor enter s a standard contact entitled 4+ STAFFING . The contact address es presenting issues, family strengths, service needs, barriers or systemic issues, and recommendations. MANAGEMENT OF INVESTIGATION TIMEFRAMES D.C. Official Code \u00a74-1301.06 allows CFSA to complete a CPS investigation no more than 30 days after receipt of the first notice of suspected abuse or neglect . The initial contacts and safety assessment are due within 24 hours of the referral coming into the Hotline. Supervisors are charged with monitoring the progress of investigations through the above -mentioned techniques (weekly supervision, 18 -Day Review, etc.). Investigations are expected to have timely initial contact, regular follow -up documentation , and timely submission for closure (at least 2 full business days prior to the investigation reaching the 30 day mark). In the event that there are justifiable reasons for an investigation to exceed the 30 -day time frame , the following procedures are to be adhered to using the Extension Screen in FACES.NET . Extension Screen Protocol Request for the investigation extension is used in conjunction with the 72 -hour notice now provided by supervisors to program managers and the program administrator when refe rrals must exceed the 30-day time frame for closure. The supervisor verbally alert s the program manager at a minimum 72 hours prior to the referral going past 30 days . At this time, the supervisor request s approval for extension in FACES.NET . Upon auth orization from the program manager, the supervisor enter s the reason code for extension with supporting information into the extension comment screen. The Extension Screen will provide justification and statistical data capturing the circumstances associat ed with the extension. The Extension Screen is not to be used without discussion and prior approval from a program manager or assigned designee and can only be requested in FACES.NET at the 72 -hour time frame or the 27th day of the life span of the i nvestigation. Important Notes The Comments Screen is mandatory and must provide a description based upon the Reason Code pick -list, to include the date and time of the contact note authorizing the extension request and identifying next steps. The Days of Extension field is required. It must be completed with a dummy number, which is 30, and the timeframe for the extension will be reevaluated every week to determine if more time is required for safe closure. Due to limited characters in the Comment section, written documentation is required within the Contact Screen identifying the reason code, next steps, and proposed timeframes for when the referral can be completed for closure as it pertains to t he extension request . It is understood that there are circum stances in which this cannot be determined . Nevertheless , all pertinent information regarding next steps must be provided. It is important for ongoing documentation to be entered into the Contact Screen denoting steps taken to move the referral to closure or the identification of new system barriers. The docum entation can reflect supervisory directives, 18 -day review guidance, steps completed by the social worker, outstanding actions, etc. The contact notes should be current and detailed with all action st eps taken by the assigned social worker and any other staff members. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 170 Supervisors must be mindful that even when there is justification for an investigation to exceed the 30 -day period, additional corrective action may be appropriate if the social worker' s documentation is not current or does not reflect the need for the investigation to exceed the 30-day timeframe. Investigations with an approved extension will still require regular weekly review via the 18 -Day Review process as well as follow up on appro priate investigation steps. Documentation will be entered weekly, at a minimum, in FACES.NET regarding the progress toward safe and timely closure. Only under extenuating circumstances and approval from the CPS administrator can a 30 -Day Extension be r equested and approved in FACES.NET after the 30 -day timeframe. All requirements for documentation as referenced above must occur and be entered in the Contact Screen. Legitimate Reasons for Extension Unable to Identify or Locate The social worker is in the process of completing all mandatory measures to identify a nd locate children and families but n ot all steps have been completed or the results of the investigative steps have not yet been received. Out of Jurisdiction A child or family currently re sides or is located outside of the DC jurisdiction . The return of the child or family and/or a response to an out of jurisdiction courtesy interview request will not occur within the 30 -day period, or there is insufficient time upon their return or receipt of the requested courtesy interview assessment, to complete a safe closure. For this Reason Code, it is important to include all attempts made to confirm and document in the Contact Screen the family's location and any other verification that is currently pending. Uncooperative Client The social worker has made reasonable efforts to engage a client who refuses access to a child, individual, home, or information pertinent to the investigation. This information is critical to child safety or the disposition of the investigation. Reasonable efforts may include police involvement, assistance of co -workers, visits on varied shifts, pre -petition custody order, etc. Delay in Receipt of Critical Information The social worker has attempted to obtain information c ritical to child safety or to the disposition of the investigation. The receipt of this information is pending. Links New allegations have been linked to the investigation during the last 10 days of the 30 -day timeframe and there is insufficient time to reassess child safety and appropriately disposition the new allegations of the investigation. Law Enforcement Aspects of joint investigations (detective assignment, CAC interview, perpetrator interview, etc.) are pending and dependent on outside sources (MPD, Safe Shores, CAPC, etc.). The pending information has a direct impact on child safety or on the disposition of the investigation. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 171 Child Fatality MDT investigation information (autopsy findings, perpetrator interviews, etc.) is pending and dependent on outside sources. The pending information has a direct impact on child safety or on the disposition of the investigation. ENHANCED G RAND ROUNDS Grand Rounds is a monthly quality assurance meeting held by CPS to review open investigations that have bee n randomly selected from each CPS unit. The teaming panel for a Ground Rounds meeting includes various members of the Quality Assurance (QA) administration in addition to the representatives from CPS management (the administrator, program managers, and a r otating selection of two supervisors per month) as well as other Agency stakeholders . Meetings begin with a presentation by the supervisor who uses a QA tool to review the status of the open referral. The panel team then provides the supervisor with feed back that is focused on the caliber of ongoing procedures necessary to ensure a complete and thorough investigation prior to closure. The supervisor is responsible for ensuring that any recommended actions have been taken prior to closing the investigation . Documentation in FACES.NET should reflect the Agency's quality improvement efforts. You MUST document the CPS Grand Rounds, along with whatever recommendations were made and any follow - up that you completed. SUPERVISORY REVIEW FOR INVESTIGATION CLOS URE In order to ensure that the investigation may be safely closed, it is essential that you have conducted a thorough review of the investigation activities, and document ed these activities, along with the safety and risk assessments in FACES.NET . The fol lowing activities must be documents: Review the original referral and any linked referrals to refresh the concerns that brought the family to the agency's attention. o Ensure that all concerns have been addressed in the investigation. Review client d emograph ics. o Ensure that all clients have correct and consistent spelling of names and dates of birth or make notation of the reason why the spelling changed throughout the course of the investigation (new information, etc.). Ensure that the following information from the Contact Screens are updated: o Attempted or completed contacts with reporting source(s) o Completed and thorough FACES.NET search o Completed contacts for all active clients o Completed medical collateral contacts o Completed educational or daycare collater al contacts Review the previously completed safety assessment. o Determine whether any update is needed prior to closure. o If safety concerns are anticipated to persist after the investigation closure, ensure that the documentation reflects ongoing safety p lanning. Review the risk a ssessment and approve. o Ensure that the risk assessment accurately reflects the overall family risk. o Ensure that any necessary overrides are completed. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 172 Review the assessment n otes. Review the disposition. o Ensure that the documentat ion in the contacts and assessment notes supports the overall disposition. Complete the Case Connect and approve. o Any substantiated allegation MUST have a CFSA case attached to the investigation, even if it is only to support and close based on the risk le vel. o Ensure that the social worker has completed the hard record, either for transfer to ongoing or for submission to closed files. o Depending on the recommending Case Connect decision, justify whether a case is being opened or closed and whether the family is being referred to the Collaboratives. o Remember that Collaborative services are voluntary (even in substantiated investigations) and if a family refuses these services, an override of the overall risk level may be warranted to ensure appropriate service provision through the Agency. o Remember that without a substantiated disposition, involvement in an Agency case is voluntary for a family, regardless of risk level. Review the recommendations and closure and approve . FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 173 APPENDICES I.

Such danger is identified and understood after full evaluati on and understandin g of the individual and family conditions or family functioning . In other words , impending danger refers to a family situation in which a child is not in immediate danger but there yet exists a general state of danger because of what is understood to be ha ppening within his or her family. Without a safety intervention , there is reasonable cause to believe the impending danger will lead to severe harm of the child . Licensed or Temporarily Licensed Foster and Kinship Homes : \"Temporary licensed\" -- Permissio n has been granted to a relative to operate a kinship foster home for a temporary period (no more than 120 days ).

The safety plan is implemented and active as long as impending danger FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 178 threats exist and caregiver protective capacities are insufficient to assure a child is protected. The safety plan specifies what impending danger s exist, how the impending danger will be managed using identified safety services; who will participate in those safety services; and under what circumstances and agreements and in accordance with what specification of time requireme nts, availability, accessibility and suitability of those involved. The safety plan is designed along a continuum of least -to- most intrusive intervention: in -home safety options , a combination of in -home and out -of-home safety options , and out -of-home safe ty options. \"Vulnerable Child\": A child who is unable to protect him or herself.

Drugs and Their Effects FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 180 Appendix II:1 - SAFETY ASSESSMENT CRITERIA Signs of Present Danger A child has received serious physical harm or injury that appears to be inflicted. The child has physical injuries resulting from use of instruments (e.g., cigarette burns, hot water, belts, and sticks) to inflict severe pain or injuries due to dangerous acts (e.g., choking, shaking of an infant, or cruelty). The child has a serious physic al injury and the caregiver has given an explanation that is inconsistent or insufficient. The child has special needs, behaviors , or medical concerns that are not being met or managed ; failure to meet the child's needs may result in immediate danger of serious harm to the child. It appears that the caregiver has not, cannot, or will not protect the child from potential serious harm, including harm from other persons having familial access to the child; the caregiver overtly rejects any intervention that is necessary to prevent or eliminate immediate danger of serious harm to the child. The caregiver or another person who has access to the child has made a credible threat or another person expresses a credible belief that the caregiver's actions may result in serious harm to a child. The behavior of any member of the household or another person having access to the child is violent or out of control, and suggests that the child may be or is presently in immediate danger of serious harm. Any member of the household or another person having access to the child describes actions or acts toward the child in predominantly or extremely negative terms or has extremely unrealistic expectations of the child that would suggest the child may be in immediate danger of serious harm. Drug or alcohol use by any member of the household or another person having access to the child suggests that the child may be in immediate danger of serious harm. Behavior that is symptomatic of some disability or a mental or physical illness of any member of the household or any person having access to the child and the child may be in immediate danger of serious harm. The caregiver appears unwilling or unable to meet the child's immediate needs for sufficient supervision, food, clothing, or shelter that would otherwise protect child from immediate danger of serious harm. The caregiver appears unwilling or unable to meet the child's immediate physical or mental health needs and failure to do so may result in the child being in immediate danger of serious harm. Household environmental hazards suggest that the child may be in immediate danger of serious harm. Acts of domestic violence (e.g., family violence or batterer violence) suggest a child may be immediate danger of serious harm. Child sexual abuse or sexual exploitation is suspected, and the circumstances suggest that child may be in immediate danger of serious harm. The child is exposed to criminal activities in the household (e.g., the manufacturing, distribution, drug trafficking , or sale of illegal drugs) and the child may be in immediate danger due to the exposure to these activities. The caregiver has previously had parental rights terminated as a result of abuse or neglect , or the caregiver has failed to benefit from any previous service s related to child safety issues, or has had children removed from his/her care due to abuse or neglect. There is reason to believe the child is in immediate danger of serious harm and the family refuses the Agency access to the child, or the child's where abouts cannot be ascertained, or there is reason to believe the family will flee. A paramour is the alleged or indicated perpetrator of physical abuse or sexual abuse. Child is fearful of the caregiver, other family members, or other people living in or having access to the home. FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 181 Protective Capacities of the Caregiver Defers his/her own needs in order to meet the child's needs. Displays a desire and capability to prevent future harm to the child. Accepts and demonstrates the responsibility and skills needed to nurture and provide for the basic needs of the child.

Child Vulnerability Factors The vulnerability factors of children are identified on the safety assessment: 0 - 5 years Medically fragile Physically handicapped or disabled Developmenta lly disabled Emotionally disturbed Serious illness or health problem Inability to communicate Prone to inconsolable crying Sustained a serious injury requiring immediate medical attention Exhibits fetal alcohol exposure or fetal alcohol syndrome ( FAE/FAS ), positive toxicity, or human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV) Sexually abused Malnourished and underweight Sexually provocative, juvenile delinquent , or significant behavioral problems No child vulnerability factors FINAL 1 2.24.13 Child Protective Services Administration District of Columbia's Child and Family Services Agency 182 Appendix II: 2 - SIGNS OF DEVELOPMEN TAL DELAYS Note: T his list is not comprehensive! Any single concern may not necessarily indicate a delay. Keep in mind when assessing a child's development that there is a range of \"normal\" within each stage. You must schedule an assessment or testing for any child whom you suspect has a developmental lag, regardless of the child's age.

Equally disturbing was the rate of drug addiction (8.9%) , which was almost double the national rate (4.7%). This pervasive use of drugs in the District continues to influence and be influenced by homelessness, unemployment, mental illness, and crime. (Almost 60% of male teenagers who are arrested in the District are tested positive for illegal drug use.) Misuse /abuse of drugs is an issue that immediately impacts children, youth, and families served by CFSA. Research studies confirm that children whose parents or caregivers are misusing drugs (or are addicted to drugs) perform poorly in school, often suffer from emotional and/or psychological p roblems, present with behavioral problems (e.g., truancy and delinquency), and most importantly for the CPS investigator, are more likely to suffer child abuse and neglect at the hands of the drug - using caregiver. When you assess a family and the home fo r safety and risk, it is important that you are familiar with the names, effects, paraphernalia, and even withdrawal symptoms related to the use of the ten most common illicit drugs: cocaine (coke, snow, blow) crack cocaine (crack, rock, freebase) ecstasy (clarity, lover's speed) heroin (smack, junk, brown sugar, horse) LSD (acid, white lightening, blue heaven, sugar) marijuana (pot, weed, mary jane, dope, ganja) methamphetamine (crank, ice, crystal meth, speed) opium (paregoric, dover's PCP (angel dust, hog, loveboat) psilocybin (magic mushrooms, 'shrooms) While the above -cited drugs may be the \"most popular\", there are still many others that are commonly used and equally as dangerous to the users and to any children who are exposed to their use, particularly in utero. Additional abuse might include over -the- counter drugs, including cough syrups and inhalants, or more serious prescription drugs such as oxycontin or oxycodone ( see Prescription Drug Abuse section below ). 3 Available on the District's Addiction Prevention and Recovery Administration (APRA) website at http://doh.dc.gov/doh/frames.asp?doc=/doh/lib/doh/services/administration_offices/apr/pdf/dcstrategy2003_10_15_03.pdf&group=1 787&open 188 The following table gives a general description of the top 10 drugs, their clinical names, effects, associated paraphernalia, and withdrawal symptoms. Note: This list is not exhaustive! If you have any suspicion of misuse of any drugs by your clients, including youth, caregivers, an d resource parents, you should consult with the Agency's Clinical Health Services Administration .

It is not legal. PRESCRIPTION DRUG AB USE In general, pres cription drugs are legally obtained by adults for legitimate reasons but a growing number of teens are frequently abusing these otherwise legal drugs. According to the federal Office of National Drug Control Policy, abuse of prescription drugs (i.e., tranq uilizers, sedatives, pain relievers, stimulants) is only second to the use of marijuana in the United States. All CPS investigators should be familiar with different types of prescription drugs, their effects, and possible withdrawal symptoms. There are t hree basic types of prescription drugs: opioids central nervous system (CNS) depressants stimulants COMMONLY ABUSED PRESCRIPTION DRUGS Name Type Possible Effects (\"positive\" & negative) Withdrawal Symptoms Federal Class Brevital or methohexital Surital CNS depressant - Barbiturates Mild euphoria Sleep induction Impaired thinking and/or coordination Irritability Fainting Nervousness Convulsions Nause a Schedule II (see table above) 194 (thiamylal) Seconal (secobarbital ) Release of inhibition Slurred speech Anti -depressant Muscle relaxants Reduction of irritability and/or excitement Induces sle ep Anti -convulsants Effects may last 6 to 12 hours.

Fatigue Irritability Depression Violence Disturbed sleep Schedule II (see table above) ALCOHOL ABUSE Although research supports moderate use of alcohol for some health benefits, alcohol abuse or dependence is fraught with medical complications. Since it is legal and readily accessible, it is one of the most dangerously addictive available drugs in society. In fact, dependence on alcohol is the primary source of ad diction in the District of Columbia.4 It also has a much higher percentage of abuse in the District than the national average 4 First City wide Comprehensive Substance Abuse Strategy for the District of Columbia; see Fo otnote #1 above. 195 (14% compared to 9.2%). Again, like other drugs, use of alcohol during pregnancy is particularly dangerous and one of the most pre ventable causes of birth defects. As a CPS investigat ive social worker , it is important that you not only know the signs of alcohol abuse, but that you also recognize that there are now psychiatric implications of alcohol abuse currently listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM -IV-TR) under Substance Abuse Disorders. Lastly, it is important that you recognize the dramatic influence of alcohol abuse on youth. As reported in 2009 by the District 's Addiction Prevention and Rehabilitation Administration (APRA), \"a pproximately one in four high school students took their first drink of alcohol before age 13.\"5 These youth will likely continue drinking despite formidable consequences, including fatal automobile accidents. ALCOHOL (ethanol C2H5OH) Basic Types Source Alcohol % Possible Effects (\"positive\" & negative) Withdrawal Symptoms Federal Class Beer Fermented grains 3-6 % has 8 -12 % Mild euphoria Increased longevity (for older, moderate drinkers - ages 48+) Lowered coronary heart disease (35% in moderate drinkers) Lowered inhibitions Loss of balance and/or coordination Impaired judgment (inappropriate behavior) Slurred speech Delayed reflexes Irritability Depression Dehydration Vomiting Unconsciousness Liver disease Effects may last 1 to 6 hours. Tremors Anxiety Panic attacks Hallucination Delusions Depression Paranoia Nausea Vomiting Elevated heart rate Convulsions Seizures Death (if untreated ) Non -applicable Only drugs that are not o penly legal for purchase by adults are classified. Wine Fermented fruits 11-14% Note: dessert wines or aperitifs may have as much as 20 % Liquor (e.g., whiskey, vodka, rum, tequila, gin, etc.) Distillation of fermented grains (wheat, barley, rye ), corn, potatoes, agave, sugarcane, juniper berries 40-50 % 5 Youth and Drugs: The Case for Infrastructure and Targeted Strategies in the Nation's Capitol ( APRA, 2009) 196 TOBACCO USE Addiction to nicotine (the active ingredient in tobacco) is now a widely -recognized problem for smokers, in addition to the health warnings that smoking causes cancer. This inform ation appears to have impacted District teens who markedly decreased their use of tobacco between 2003 and 2009.6 Nonetheless, District teens continue to buy and smoke cigarettes. Research does indicate that nicotine has some relaxation effects on the bo dy, including mild pain relief and increasing positive emotions. Nicotine stays in the body for about 2 hours, if only one cigarette is smoked. The cumulative effect, however, will last for 6 to 8 hours, and will increase the desire for more. When withdraw ing from nicotine addiction, the American Heart Association reports that one or more the following symptoms will occur: irritability impatience hostility anxiety depressed mood difficulty concentrating restlessness decreased heart rate Increased appetite o r weight gain How Long Do Drugs Stay in the Body ?

Quick Reference Guide for TTY Services The text teletype machine (TTY) is a machine to make telephone calls by people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or speech impair. The following instructions are useful for the correct handling of TTY calls: If you don't have a TTY, you may call a person who is deaf, hard of hearing or speech -impairment by using the Telecommunications Relay Service s (TRS). There are only a few people who use TTY's, many deaf and hard of hearing people use the TRS to communicate over the phone. The TRS is provided by the phone company to allow TTY users access to communication with non -TTY users. The proce dures for making a relay call are: 1. Call the TRS with the number in the front pages of the telephone book (Each State has a different number). District of Columbia 800-643- 3768 Maryland 800-735-2258 Virginia 800-828-1120 2. You will hear or see a TRS message. The message will say \"may I have your number please\"). 3. Say or type the number you want to call. 4. While your number is b eing relayed, talk or type as though you are speaking directly to the person you called. Your conversation will be relayed. 5. Each time you finish speaking or typing, say \"Go Ahead\" or type \"GA\" to indicate that you are ready for the other per son to respond. 6. When you are done with your call and you would like to make another TTY call, don't hang up. The TTY system will be ready to place your next call. 204 APPENDIX I V: 2 - CPS HISTORY - CFSA FACES.NET Search, Closed Records Search, History with Other Jurisdictions, and Documentation Why know history? As the clich\u00e9 goes, history is the best predictor of the future for a family . Families may not openly reveal critical ele ments of their family that would be helpful to know going into the investigation, such as ... ~ Additional children ~ Persons not allowed contact with family ~ Patterns of maltreatment and neglect Someone else may search the family in the future and realize that yo u did not take into account critical information about the family . Beginning Your Search Know as many components of the family as possible by obtaining an ACEDS report for the family . The referral snapshot is typically not reflective of all family mem bers or all Agency history, which is why you search yourself . Searching every family member is important because not all family members are listed in every investigation . Step One: Beginning the search 205 Begin by pulling down the \"Client\" tab to \"Search\" Remember that you can search by address only and may find additional results if names were not updated in FACES.NET. Just uncheck the client characteristics box an d check the address box. FACES.NET often shows many slight variations on the same person, such as having a DOB that is one day off or having a name spelled with a minor difference. Because of this it is best to search using as little information as possi ble. If the client has a fairly uncommon last name use that only and then search through the results. Remember to check common misspellings or variations in names. 206 Step Two: Checking past referra ls We typically begin by checking the past referrals on a client we have searched. In this cas e we can see that the client \"Ophelia Bell\" had several prior referrals. You can make a note on scratch paper of the referral numbers and the date the referral was opened to review later. 207 Step Three: Checking past cases Step Four: Cross reference relatives Step Five: Repeat data entry Checking the cases tab shows whether the family has had an open case with CFSA. However, be mindful that cases can involve someone either as a maltreating parent or as a victim child - so further research is needed. Note the case numbers and the time span that the case was opened. Check the relations tab to make sure you are aware of all relatives that FACES.NET shows for this individual. If there is someone new to you, add them to the individuals that you search. In older cases, relationships may be shown as \"relative (other)\", typically these individuals are not childr en of the person you are searching. 208 Repeat for all relatives to ensure all history is noted. This can be time consuming but it often results in finding additi onal and important history on the family. Step Six: Summary Begin by researching the family referrals in chronological order (and document them the same way). You should summarize *why the referral came to the Agency's attention ; *what the assessment fin dings were ; and *any other information that appears pertinent in reviewing the notes (such as medical conditions for the children or persons who may have harmed the children in the past, etc.) . Step Seven: Substantiated history The case summary shows why the case was closed, if applicable 209 If the family case was involved with the Family Court, the Court Report screens can be helpful in summarizing Agency history. If the family has open Agency history, you can check the most recent contacts with the family. You should also check the Assignment Screen so that you can speak with the ongoing social worker about the family. 210 Step E ight: Closed files You should review any closed records on families with CFSA history. Depending on the age of the case , it may be the only option to determine what the family history was about. Document your review of the case, the reason for closure ( if applicable), and your conversation with the ongoing family worker (if applicable). Step Nine: CPS history in other jurisdictions When we have direct knowledge or suspicion that a family may have had involvement with CPS in another jurisdiction , we sh ould obtain that information. The following is a link to the CPS hotlines for the 50 states and DC: http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/reslist/rl_dsp.cfm?rs_id=5&r ate_chno=11 -11172 Step Ten: Documentation Please document your findings in chronological order and separated between investigations and major points in any cases. Documentation example: FACES.NET SEARCH: On July 13, 2009 this social worker completed a FACES.NET search regarding this family. It appears that Mother's Name is known to CFSA and has at least six children: 1. Child's Name - DOB 2. Child's Name - DOB 3. Child's Name - DOB 4. Child's Name - DOB 5. 6. Child's Name - DOB *On 02/22/2000 the Agency received referral #572579 when it was reported that Damia Weaver came to school and complained that her mother had hit her with a belt. There were reportedly not observable injuries but the child was apparently repeatedly pointing t o her back. There is not a completed assessment finding by CFSA but there is documentation in the contacts that the matter was unsupported by YID. 211 *On 04/29/2002 the Agency received referral #590834 when Damia Weaver came to school with marks on her arms and face and disclosed that her mother had hit her with a belt. The child was reportedly beaten for not taking a bath. Investigation found that the child had abusive injuries, including injuries to her face. The mother was reported to have continued striki ng the child even after she struck her in the face and injured her. Damia was removed from the care of her mother. The status of the two other children ( Jada and Isaiah ) is not immediately clear from this write -up. This investigation prompted the opening o f Agency case #193161 in May 2002. *On 09/07/2002 the Agency received referral #593650 when it was reported that Damia had been placed in the care of a relative by order of the Family Court but the C ourt's order was violated and the child was reported to have returned to the care of the mother. Additional allegations of physical abuse against the mother were substantiated. The younger siblings ( Jada and Isaiah ) were also removed at this time. The matter was connected to the ongoing Agency case. *On 12/02/ 2003 the Agency received I&R #602579 but the information is too minimal to determine the nature of the call. *On 03/24/2006 the Agency received referral #622639 when Damia disclosed during a therapy session that her mother had \"pulled a knife on her\" in t he past when the child was in the mother's care. The child ultimately reported that she was \"just kidding\" about the allegation. The allegation of imminent danger of abuse was unfounded. *On 04/26/2008 the Agency received I&R #640192 when Damia contacted the Hotline to report that her mother hits her younger siblings. It appears that the youth was in the home with her mother at the time of the call. The mother was spoken with by the Hotline worker and denied the allegations. An I&R was taken and the matter was forwarded to the assigned ongoing staff. *Records indicate that at some point the father of Jada and Isaiah obtained legal custody of them and they reside with him in Maryland. The Agency case remains open at this time with Damia remaining in care wi th a permanency goal of reunification with her mother. There have been sporadic times of reunification but long term stability has not been achieved. The case is assigned to social worker Debra Sutton . 212 APPENDIX I V: 3 - DILIGENT SEARCH LOCATOR REFE RRAL FORM ( 2013) THE REFERRING PARTY MUST PROVIDE AS MUCH IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AS POSSIBLE.

CLIENT PROFILE SCREEN The client profile screen shows basic information about the client such as DOB, SSN. The client ID is also the client's Medicaid number. Simply take the last six digits and add a 7 at the beginning. Be mindful if a client has more than one case number because this could provide additional demographic information. 218 II. CASE PROFILE SCREENS III. HOUSEHOLD SUMMARY SCREEN S The case profile screen often has helpful demographic information such as addresses and phone numbers. NOTE: This database may not always be up to date. The subsequent pages of the case profile show the type of involvement the family has, along with the status o f the case. The most common codes are explained in a few pages. This screen also shows whether a client is participating in a specific service (e.g., TANF or food stamps).

The parent or caregiver has been advised that it is the practice of CFSA to ensure tha t the child who instigated the sexual activity not have any contact with the victim child. This is most appropriately accomplished when the instigating child lives in an environment away from the victim child and other children. The purpose of this is to e nsure physical safety by preventing access to other children. This is also to ensure that the victim child does not endure unnecessary emotional distress by being exposed to the instigating youth. A parent or caregiver has identified a safety plan in con junction with CFSA to address the above safety concerns. The parent or caregiver acknowledges that the above concerns regarding sexual activity between children have been discussed with them. The ________ SE Washington, DC 20003 www.cfsa.dc.gov 227 APPENDIX I V: 15 - COMPLETING THE RISK ASSESSMENT Completing a risk assessment requires a comprehensive investigation that looks into all areas of family and child safety and well-being . Understanding the overall risk factors in a family helps to accurately plan for ongoing service provision for the family. Risk is the likelihood that a child may be abused or maltreated in the future. The Agency 's Structured Decision Making ( SDM ) risk assessment tool assesses families for low, moderate, high, or intensive probabilities of future abuse and neglect. These risk levels, along with your clinical judgment and the disposition decision, will guide your decision whether or not to open a case, whether to refer the family to a collaborati ve or other community services , or whether to close an investigation with no further services. The risk assessment must be completed toward the end of the investigation and within 30 days. It is based upon a full assessment of the family and thorough know ledge of the strengths and challenges therein. Note: The risk assessment must be completed on the household that is the primary residence of the child. If the alleged maltreater resides in a different household but continues to function as a caregiver and is entitled and obligated to provide for the safety and well-being of a child, a risk assessment on that household should also be completed. If the child is a member of two households, and both caregivers are identified as alleged perpetrators, a separate family risk assessment must be completed for each household. 228 In completing your risk assessment you may consider the following risk factor categories: Child Risk Factors Premature birth Positive toxicology or exposure in utero Birth an omalies Low birth weight Temperament: difficult or slow to warm up Physical/cognitive/emotional disability Chronic or serious illness Childhood trauma Mental health concerns Age Behavior problems Special needs Parental/Family Risk Factors Personality Factors External locus of control Poor impulse control Depression and a nxiety Low tolerance for frustration Feelings of insecurity Lack of trust Insecure attachment with own parents Childhood history of abuse High parental conflict, domestic viol ence Family structure - single parent with lack of support, high number of children in household Social isolation, lack of support Parental psychopathology Substance abuse (past or present) Separation or divorce, especially high -conflict divorce Age Number of children High stress level Poor parent -child interaction, negative attitudes and attributions about child's behavior Inaccurate knowledge and expectations about child development Social/Environmental Risk Factors Low socioeconomic status Stressful life events Lack of access to medical care, health insurance, adequate child care, or other services Parental unemployment Homelessness Social isolation or l ack of social support Exposure to racism or discrimination Poor schools Exposure to en vironmental toxins Dangerous or violent neighborhood Community violence The risk assessment must be clearly documented in FACES.NET in the Risk Assessment Screens. Your overall documentation should address the prominent risk concerns and any needed services. There are three distinct parts of the risk assessment. All of them must be completed. Remember : You must create your household(s) in order to be able to complete the risk assessment. Please see the screen shots below which will guide you through this process and also give examples of proper documentation. 229 Risk Assessment Screen Document all answers to all questions utilizing the help tool to clarify definitions in each category . You should be very familiar with the definitions for each multi ple choice question in order to accurately assess the risk level. Assessment Narrative Document Risk Factors in a list format, including those identified on the risk assessment screen and others. Document family strengths, as appropriate. Document the fa mily's support system, including fathers, relatives, and \"kin.\" This should include what type of support they provide. Document the overall level of risk. Conclusion Not accessible until all questions on the risk assessment have been answered and the narrative assessment completed. Document whether or not overrides are applicable. If a discretionary override is selected, the final risk level will change to one level higher than the scored risk level. Note : If a discretionary override is selected, you must explain why the discretionary override is appropriate. Request approval from your supervisor. See the FACES.NET screens below to guide you: 230 1. CREATING THE HOUSEHOLD Begin by selecting the household option under the referral tab so that you can create the household (or households) under assessment. 231 2. BUILD THE HOUSEHOLD Select the primary caregiver and make your start date the date the investigation was opened. Then briefly describe the household composition. Don't forget to save! And then select show so that you can add clients to the household. 232 3. ADD HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS Add members that apply to your household. Not all clients have to be a part of the household unless applicable. Don't forget to save! Remember to repeat thi s process if more than one household needs to be assessed! 233 4. START THE RISK ASSESSMENT Begin your risk assessment by sele cting the household you want to work on. 234 5. SELECT THE HOUSEHOLD Select the household you want to work on. If you've created more than one household, all of the options will show here. Don't forget to select show. 235 6. RISK ASSESSMENT SCREENS There ar e three areas (screens) of the risk assessment that need to be completed prior to sending the assessment for approval. 236 7. FAMILY RISK ASSESSMENT Complete each section of the weighted risk assessment questions. A corresponding number will populate to the right of your screen. Don't forget to scroll down and don't forget to save! 237 8. FAMILY RISK ASSESSMENT Remember to adhere to the definitions for each weighted question. You can access the definition by selecting the question mark next to the number of the question. We've opened up a common definition for question #5 which often is overlooked or completed incorrectly. 238 9. RISK ASSESSMENT NARRATIVE Your risk assessment narrative needs to address three areas: -Risk factors -Family supports -Overall risk lev el Risk factors Explain and add risk factors that may not have been listed in the weighted section. Family supports Include family and friends as well as professional supports. Overall risk Ensure that your overall risk level fits with the computer gene rated risk level or explain why your assessment differs from the SDM level. For example, you may find that extensive Agency history many years ago unduly skewed a current risk assessment. 239 APPENDIX V : Educational Neglect 1.

Minimal Basic Needs of Children 244 CPS PRACTICE POINT Minimal Basic Needs of Children Adapted from the Research Foundation of SUNY - Center for Development of Human Services The minimal basic needs of children are very much the same as the minimal basic needs of an adult, some of which may seem to be plain \"common sense\". Nonetheless, as the CPS social worker, you should fami liarize yourself with the list below, and recognize that these standards are provided as guidance only. Every standard DOES NOT have to be met for you to have concerns about a child's safety or for you to provide support or intervention. You will have to m ake assessments on a case -by- case basis for whether families are promoting their children's safety and healthy development through provision of minimal basic needs: food and nutrition, clothing, shelter, hygiene and cleanliness, medical care, supervision, and discipline. MEDICAL CARE Minimal Standards Actual/Potential harm to the Child Adequate treatment sought for serious/acute illnesses or injuries Standardized routine health care provided, including dental, psychiatric and optometric Attention to r ecommended follow -up medical and dental appointments Required medications and other treatments provided Child may suffer acute or chronic illness/injury; experience long -term disability or loss of function due to untreated or improperly treated illness o r injury; be unable to attend school regularly, impairing social, emotional, mental development; or die. SUPERVISION Minimal Standards Actual/Potential harm to the Child Supervision will be adequate for the child based on age and developmental level. Infants and toddlers will be supervised at all times by someone capable of meeting their needs and keeping them safe. Older children will be supervised at a level commensurate with their age, developmental level, behavior, and temperament to make sure they a re not engaging in hazardous behavior or are in a hazardous situation. Children will not supervise other children they Child may experience acute or chronic illness or injury; engage in truancy or delinqu ent behavior; sexually exploited, abducted, abandoned; or die. 245 are developmentally incapable of caring for or keeping safe; supervision will be structured so that children are in school when required and at home late at night ( not roaming the streets unsupervised ). Supervision will be provided by someone capable of providing the level of care required (for example, not under the influence of drugs or alcohol to the extent that they are incapable of pr oviding the level of supervision required ; also , not physically or mentally infirm to the point that they are incapable of providing the level of supervision required.) DISCIPLINE Minimal Standards Actual/Potential harm to the Child Caregiver s will discipline their children commensurate with the child's age , developmental level, physical and mental conditio n and capacity to understand the intent of the discipline. Discipline should not go beyond what is objectively reasonable. Discipline may include corporal punishment but the corporal punishment should not be excessive. The following questions can help to determine the appropriateness of discipline: Does the child understand why he or she is being punished? Is the level of punishment commensurate with the misbehavior? Is the means of punishment appropriate to correct the behavior? Are less severe alternativ es available? What is the nature of the punishment? (It should not be brutal, degrading, or sexual in nature or beyond the child's level of endurance; nor should the discipline seriously injure the child or put the child at risk of serious injury.) Child may suffer serious physical injury or risk of serious physical injury; suffer long -term emotional trauma, poor self - concept ; become disabled long -term or permanently lose functioning or risk loss thereof; become mentally impaired or risk impairment; or die. CLOTHING 246 Minimal Standards Actual/Potential harm to the Child Free from filth, parasites, and foul odors Big enough to fit adequately Capable of providing protection from harsh weather, including footwear Covers private parts of the body Child may suffer acute or chronic illness/injury (scabies, frostbite); be ostracized by peers, resulting in damaged self-concept; avoid school or be suspended; adopt delinquent behaviors (shoplifting) to obtain other clothing ; or be sexually exploited. FOOD & NUTRITI ON Minimal Standards Actual/Potential harm to the Child Provision of food that meets established nutritional requirements for physical and mental development and basic energy needs Sufficient quantity to regularly meet nutritional needs, including fluid intake Feeding assistance based on developmental or other needs as appropriate Hygienically safe preparation and storage of foods Child may experience acute or chronic illness, weight loss, vitamin deficiency, disease, injury, developmental delays, loss of function or disability; feel unloved due to unmet needs; adopt delinquent behaviors (stealing food) in order to get needs met ; or die. HYGIENE AND CLEANLINESS Minimal Standards Actual/Potential harm to the Child Developmentally appropriate training in personal care Regular bathing to keep skin free of infections, foul odors, parasites, sores, urine, and fecal matter Hair free of parasites Attention to dental hygiene Opportunity to attend to hygiene and grooming as culturally appropriate Child may suffer acute or chronic illness/infection/infestation; suffer from peer of societal ostracism; suffer damaged self -esteem; may be suspended from school; or suffer impeded social and emotional development. SHELTER Minimal Standards Actual/Potential harm to t he Child Shelter that provides basic safety (no collapsing Child may 247 ceilings or obvious fire hazards) Sanitation (a way to adequately dispose of waste products, freedom from vermin) Access to water Protection from the elements experience acute or chroni c disease/illness/injury, social ostracism, and poor self -concept ; or die.
