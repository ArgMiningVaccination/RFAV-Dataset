It IS possible to heal your peripheral neuropathy. Your body never forgets how to heal itself. It just needs the right support. Your body makes its own anti-inflammatory substances and painkillers, and our therapies help it do just that. We keep it simple Healing your peripheral neuropathy does not have to be difficult. Simple, targeted lifestyle and diet changes, along with our specific/personalized natural therapies, are a very clear and concise way to attack the problem head on. We address the root cause, not just suppress symptoms Our process focuses on treating the actual root CAUSE of your peripheral neuropathy. This is why so many have found relief with our therapies, even though other therapies didn't work. We use an approach your doctor does not know about Your doctor may have told you that you have to live with your peripheral neuropathy or \"this is as good as it gets\". That doesn't mean there's no treatment, it just means your doctor has run out of ideas or there aren't conventional treatments available. Oftentimes we find that people who don't respond well to conventional treatment respond very well to our natural approach. Our approach ALWAYS includes stress reduction Let's face it, living with peripheral neuropathy is stressful. And this stress negatively affects your capacity to heal. We do not ignore this, we actually teach you very simple ways to enhance sleep and relaxation which supports your body's natural healing system. We focus on how you FEEL - not just the numbers While everyone else is looking at pieces of paper with numbers, and not listening to you - WE focus on YOU, your story, and how you feel. Are you feeling more energy? Are you thinking more clearly? Are you able to be more active? Are you doing the things you love again? THAT is OUR focus. NOT more expensive, unnecessary lab tests. Your initial consultation is free. Come meet us in person and learn more. Or, just call 919-949-2676 and we'll be happy to answer your questions. * Individual results may vary.

Create a Personalized Treatment plan Based on the information taken from your assessment, we develop an easy to follow treatment plan to eliminate your pain, activate the healing potential of your body and provide long term relief. Neuroendocrine regulation We use weekly acupuncture treatments to activate your self-healing mechanisms in order to increase circulation and cellular detoxification, reduce inflammation and eliminate pain. Targeted Personalized Herbal Therapy This isn't health food store herbalism. We use super powerful and focused herbal combinations that are custom made for you. Nutritional support Through simple dietary changes and precise application of whole food nutrition (yes, real food!) we support the body's capacity to heal and renew itself on a cellular level. Ensure lasting results Our goal is elimination of your peripheral neuropathy, not just management of symptoms and endless maintenance treatments. Once you are consistently pain free, we gradually reduce the treatment frequency until you no longer need treatment. * Individual results may vary.

Come meet us in person and learn more. Or, just call 919-949-2676 and we'll be happy to answer your questions. The needles are extremely thin and specifically designed to minimize any discomfort. The vast majority of patients don't need long-term treatment. Once their condition is resolved, it stays that way. We always make sure our treatment plans are concise and focused on your problem. No \"shotgun\" approach here. Most of our patients are able to get great results with weekly visits. We can discuss this in more detail at your free consultation. Acupuncture has been practiced safely for centuries, and in the hands of an experienced practitioner is virtually risk-free. As per federal regulations, all our needles are sterile, single-use, and disposable. There is no risk of getting an infection from the needles. If you have an immune or other condition we should know about, we'll make sure to cover that with you before treatment. Actually, all it takes is some simple routines that take less than a few minutes a day and weekly visits to my office for several weeks. The vast majority of our patients are able to eat foods they enjoy again once their healing process is complete. Natural medicine actually helps your body make more of its own medicine, which is more powerful and potent than any man-made medicine. People often feel a shift after the very first treatment. Acupuncture is a very powerful way to stimulate endorphin release, which is the most powerful relaxing substance the body makes. Generally, there are no side-effects, other than occasional mild bruising (this rarely happens). There are, however, many positive side-effects including increased relaxation, better sleep, and a more positive attitude and outlook. The acupuncture needles rarely cause any bleeding whatsoever. Occasionally, a drop of blood will appear at the insertion site when the needles are removed. This drop is easily cleaned with a simple cotton swab. Your initial consultation is free.
