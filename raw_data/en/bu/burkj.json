Some companies, such as HarrisCorp.and Intel Corp.,have technology transferagreements with national laboratories, but U.S. indus\u00ad try in general has kept its distance from federal labs. One reason might be that U.S. companies want guaran\u00ad tees in the form ofpatents before they will invest heavily to adapt basic re\u00ad search for commercial applications.

Someparticularly aggressive institutions likeStanford University and the University of Wisconsin re\u00ad portedly have made more than$5 million a year in profits by licensing technologyand sharing researchcosts. Bycontrast,the U.S.Treasurymade only $2 million on patentsinJ985 even though it spent $18 billion - a third ofallR&Dspending - at about 400 federallabs.The labs do research on everythingfrom thin film and op\u00ad toelectronics technology to boll wee\u00ad vils, with the heaviest funding going to labs for weap\u00ad ons,space science andenergy re\u00ad search,medicalprograms,and physics experiments.

Nevertheless, the findings should on balance prove reassuring tothe university community. Certainly.' ourdataon'selected indicators provide,no evidence thatindustrial supportoffacultyresearchin biotechnology is associated with decreased faculty ptoductivity. Ifanything, seems inbiotechnology andotherfields is thatthey may encourage faculty to commercialize their research findings more readily than faculty without industrial research support. Such a tendency could result in 'greater income for the university and benefits to society, through increasing the, rate at' which research results are transferred into practical application .. To examine this hypothesis, we asked biotechnology faculty in oursamplewhether their university research had resulted in any patent applications, patents.tortrade secrets. Faculty with industry supportwere more than twice as likely (37versus 17%, P<0.001) as faculty withoutsuchsupportto answer affirmatively. These data do notestablish thatindustrial support actually increased the commercial productivity offaculty.

To assess whethersuch shifts in\"behavior are occurring among biotechnology faculty who are involved in UIRR's, we asked respondents to tell us how many articles.they had published in refereedjournals duringthe last3years,how many hours ofcontact they had weekly(including laboratory supervision) with students or postdoctoral fellows, and whether they had served in any ofseveral professional roles withinoroutsidethe university-inthe last3 years (7). Compared withcolleagues doingbiotechnology research, faculty significantly more facultyin oursamplehad to be principal investigators on at leastone industrial grantor contract. In contrast, thegroupwithoutindustrysupportincludes some faculty who are notPl'son projects ofanysortand may be lesssenior than ordiffer inotherways from principal investigators on industryprojects. To correct for such confounding effects,we performed multivari\u00ad ate analyses thatexamined the association between key faculty behaviors and industry supportwhilecontrolling for the faculty member's academic rank, the numberofyearssince completing his or her highesr degree, the faculty.member's total research budget fromall,sources, his or, her involvement inconsulting orother relationships withindustry, and ofothercharacteristics, of facultyand they work.

Becauseofthe wayourquestionnaire was constructed, faculty could research funds projects,onwhich,they were, PI's. These, multivariate analyses confirmedthe significanceand directionofthe inTable 2. It is possible thatfaculty with industryfunds are publishing less than they did before they began receiving industrysupport, even thoughthey still compare favorably along this dimension with facultynotparticipating inUIRR's.To examine this possibility, we askedfaculty how many papers they had published in refereed journalsduringtheir professional careers and then compared their publication rates for an average 3-year period with their reported ratesduringthe last 3 years (8).

The rest wascontributed by theinstitutions themselves. Accordingly, theinstitutions that reap the mostrewardsfrom tech transferare the ones that spend the moston research. The University ofCalifornia systemwas the top earnerin FY 2003, with about $61 milliongross income. The UC systemalso spent more ofWashington round income and researchfunding.

Intheearly-mid 1960sCongress started asking a lot more questions abouthow federal research dollars were being spent, what kinds ofresultscouldbe shown with the money, and whether those results were being appliedusefully. A numberofrelevanthearings were held. Among these were 1967 and 1970 hearings ontechnology transfer,whichwas a fairly newterm made betweentheideaoftechnology transferand patenting/licensing activity. Instead, the focus was on promoting technology transferthrough things like the Office ofStateTechnical Services and information clearinghouses.
