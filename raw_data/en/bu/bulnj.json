Before the formal creation of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in the 1950s, astrology, divination, talismans, spells and incantations, often combined with herbs, constituted the core of healthcare cultures in China. Invoked through herbal incense, gods and spirits stood as active agents in the processes of healing, while demons, beasts and insects could be repelled using such everyday herbs as artemisia, peach flowers and ginger. Past studies have persistently dismissed this ritual knowledge of herbs as 'magical' or 'superstitious', and the worldview wherein this knowledge is rooted as 'ludicrous'. Drawing on manuscripts and printed books - alongside fieldwork with folk healers in Shanghai and Hong Kong (2014-2020) - the longstanding relationship between herbs, rituals and occult arts in traditional China is instead approached from historical and anthropological perspectives. What is the place of occult herbal knowledge in Chinese medical literature? To what extent does this knowledge relate to scholarly medicine, its theories and practices? What was its significance for everyday life? And who were the actors mostly involved with the ritual use of herbs? Before the creation of an evidence-based Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) ( [Chapter 45](/doi/10.4324/9780203740262-53) in this volume) in the last century, astrology, divination, talismans, spells and incantations, often combined with herbs, had constituted the core of the healthcare culture in Chinese society. Extracted from a seventeenth-century talismanic manuscript, the following recipe illustrates this intertwined relationship between herbs and occult arts in Late Imperial China. At the midday of the 5th day of the 5th month, sit beneath a white poplar tree (bai yangshu ) and wait until a leaf falls on your side. Remove its stalk and recite the following spell: \"Your home was hanged upside down, and I am heartbroken for you; [but] I am willing to fly under the sky with you\". Whittle the stalk and out of it make a person figurine around three cun tall,( [2]offer it wine and preserved fruits for forty-nine days and nights, and then wrap it with a white cloth; use [this amulet] during an emergency so that people will not be able to see you. [Zhuyouke mijue qishu], 2.35-36) Invoked through herbal incense, gods and spirits were active agents in the processes of healing, while demons, beasts and insects could be chased away with such household herbs as artemisia, peach flowers and ginger. Past studies have persistently dismissed this ritual knowledge of herbs as 'magical' or 'superstitious', and the worldview wherein this knowledge is rooted as 'ludicrous'. Focussing on manuscripts and printed books produced between the sixteenth and early twentieth centuries and drawing on fieldwork with folk healers in Shanghai and Hong Kong, I will instead approach the longstanding relationship between herbs and occult arts in traditional China from historical and anthropological perspectives. What is the place of occult medical knowledge in Chinese medical literature? To what extent does this knowledge relate to scholarly medicine, its theories and practices? What was its significance for everyday life? And who were the actors mostly involved with the ritual use of medicines? Just as in other traditional medical systems worldwide, herbs constitute the essence of Chinese healing culture. The colossal 'Compendium of Materia Medica' ( [Bencao gangmu](#ref31_5) ), compiled in the sixteenth century, contains 1,892 entries, over half of which is dedicated to medicinal herbs alone ( [Unschuld 1984](#ref31_52): 148-9). Even though such works as the Compendium also include hundreds of minerals, animals and other substances, the Chinese term for materia medica, or bencao (lit. 'roots and grasses'), has for millennia been used to summarise the whole spectrum of therapeutic substances used in Chinese pharmacotherapy. Early dictionaries and traditional histories explain the character for medicinal drug, or yao , as 'the herbs which heal disease' ( [Shuowen jiezi](#ref31_19) , 1.15), praising them as the first healing methods primordial deities bestowed upon the Chinese ( [Lidai mingyi mengqiu](#ref31_12) , upper.1). It therefore comes as little surprise that the ritual use of herbs in such fields as astrology, talismans and incantations has thrived over the past few centuries - a fact medical histories of Late Imperial China have only recently begun to acknowledge ( [Unschuld](#ref31_55) and Zheng 2012). Alternatively known as the 'Continent of Spirits' (Shenzhou ), China is conceived of as a divine land inhabited by numinous forces ( [Lagerwey 2010](#ref31_44): 17). In both traditional and modern China, the ritual use of herbs has therefore been based on the holistic cosmology wherein everything in the universe is animated, sacred and interconnected. From spirits, stars and rivers to plants, humans and even written characters, everything is on a continuum, with the body seen as a microcosmic image of the universe itself ( [Lo 2001](#ref31_48)). As a result, herbs were never expected to be used in isolation. They were picked, cut, decocted, ground, smashed, burned, shaped, hung on walls, carried as charms, mixed with talismans and even made sacred. The time, place and direction in which they grew could affect their healing efficacy as much as their ritual use. In fact, ritual action was sometimes more crucial than the selection of particular herbs ( [Sax 2010](#ref31_51)), so much that modern botanical understandings, which break down herbs into chemical components and active agents, would sound absurd to the pre-twentieth-century Chinese. It was the intense interaction between spirits, stars, herbs and humans, rather than their mere existence in isolation, which sustained the Chinese medical practices that are analysed here. Whereas the sources examined in this chapter are textual, my primary concern is with practice, or the culture-specific ways the Chinese have transformed 'natural herbs' into 'cultural artefacts' infused with human and divine meanings ( [Hsu 2010](#ref31_39)). Looking at their ritual use in three distinct yet correlated dimensions, namely, astrology, talismans and incantations, the following pages will try to illuminate the role of herbs as powerful mediums between the human, natural and spiritual worlds in Late Imperial China. The astrological use of herbs constituted the foundation of scholarly and folk healing traditions in imperial China ( [Unschuld 1985](#ref31_53): 55-99; [Lo 2008](#ref31_49)). From their planting and harvesting to processing and consumption, the life cycle of herbs was intrinsically bound to the motions of the stars in the sky and the ritual actions of humans on earth. A herb picked at a certain time of the year, month, week, day or hour had its healing efficacy enhanced or featured miraculous therapeutic properties that would otherwise be concealed. (On these timings, see [Chapter 4](/doi/10.4324/9780203740262-6) in this volume.) Geomantic principles, such as the position a herb grows in or the place where it is kept after collection, also affected its healing and apotropaic qualities. In other words, an ordinary herb could metamorphose into a powerful weapon against demons, insects and epidemic diseases depending on its time of collection and ritual manipulation. Whereas pervasive in all aspects of Chinese medicine, astrological elements are particularly evident at certain dates and behind the use of certain herbs. In medical texts, the Duanwu , known more commonly in English as Dragon Boat Festival, is by far the most popular day for the manipulation of herbs. Falling on the fifth day of the fifth month of the Chinese lunar calendar - which means any time between late May and late June in the Gregorian calendar - the Duanwu is considered the hottest day of the year. In traditional terms, it marks the apex of yangqi and the rock bottom of yinqi ( [L\u00fcshi Chunqiu](#ref31_13) , 4.2). On the one hand, the Duanwu is the day when poisonous insects, evil spirits and epidemic diseases are most active; so much that the fifth month as a whole is also known as the 'evil month' (eyue hand, the healing and apotropaic qualities of herbs were also at their greatest on that day, especially at noon. On the Duanwu, people employed the 'five auspices', namely, the mugwort, pomegranate, calamus, garlic chinensis) to fight off the 'five poisons', represented snake, scorpion, toad ( [Suishi guangji](#ref31_20) , 21.8, 16, 21). Encyclopaedias and local gazetteers record a wide variety of herb-based rituals performed on the Duanwu. An early seventeenth-century gazetteer of the Taizhou county, Jiangsu province, states that on that date: [locals] eat rice dumplings, brew hot medicinal wine made of realgar and calamus, and eat cured meat; both men and women wear talismans written in cinnabar, tie threads of the five colours around their arms, and pin their hair with flowers and mugwort twigs. [Chongzhen Taizhou zhi](#ref31_6), 1.21) [locals] eat rice dumplings, brew hot medicinal wine made of realgar and calamus, and eat cured meat; both men and women wear talismans written in cinnabar, tie threads of the five colours around their arms, and pin their hair with flowers and mugwort twigs.( These rituals, the text concludes, are not restricted to Taizhou but conspicuous everywhere in China. Around 200 years later, a gazetteer dedicated to the same locality added boat racing and bath with the 'decoction of a hundred herbs' (baicaotang ) as two other rituals locals performed on the Duanwu. While the herbs for this decoction varied from region to region, it often included mugwort and mulberry leaves, wild chrysanthemum flowers, peach twigs, calamus and fish mint (yuxingcao ). The herbs should be picked in the early morning of the Duanwu, decocted and then used as a herbal bath later in the afternoon ( [Daoguang Taizhou zhi](#ref31_9) , 5.3-4). The ritual use of some of these herbs, intended to attract good luck and chase away the evil, can be traced back to periods as early as the second century BCE ( [Yan 2017](#ref31_57): 215, 230-1). Mugwort and calamus have for millennia been praised as powerful apotropaic herbs whose potency was enhanced on the Duanwu. A calendrical treatise compiled between the sixth and seventh centuries urges members of the same clan to pick those mugwort leaves, which resemble the image of a tiger or cut tiger shapes out of the same leaves; these would then be known as 'mugwort tigers' (aihu ) (Suishi guangji, 21.14-15). Almost a thousand years later, the practice of collecting mugwort leaves on the Duanwu and cutting shapes out of them persisted; now, the leaves should be collected before cockcrow, have the shape of humans and be hung on top of the main entrances to chase away venomous creatures (Bencao gangmu, 15.10). A recipe to wipe out demons living inside one's body calls on the sick to collect mugwort leaves on the Duanwu, mix them with musk and honey, and then prepare small pills to be taken with ginger soup ( [Huisheng Daoist texts ( The time to pick calamus falls on the 3rd day of the 3rd month, 4th day of the 4th month, 5th day of the 5th month, 6th day of the 6th month, 7th day of the 7th month, 8th day of the 8th month, 9th day of the 9th month or 10th day of the 10th month. You should pick the plants growing in pure water which flows from the south; those [growing in water which flows] from the north are not auspicious. [Bokenkamp 2015](#ref31_32)), the calamus was believed to increase longevity, improve memory and 'heal a thousand diseases'. A traditional method of collecting and preparing calamus leaves into pills combines astrological to pick calamus falls on the 3rd day of the 3rd month, 4th day of the 4th month, 5th day of the 5th month, 6th day of the 6th month, 7th day of the 7th month, 8th day of the 8th month, 9th day of the 9th month or 10th day of the 10th month. You should pick the plants growing in pure water which flows from the south; those [growing in water which flows] from the north are not auspicious.( Calamus picked on the Duanwu and mixed with honey to form pills was a particularly powerful way to boost one's vitality. After taking twenty-five pills in the early morning, twenty-five at noon and thirty late at night for a whole year, demonic creatures would leave the body and the person would enjoy long life. Daoist immortals and hermits carried calamus leaves with them on their journeys to sacred mountains, while the plant had for centuries been cultivated inside imperial palaces as a reminder of immortality (Shenxian fushi, n.p.). The sharply pointed shape of its leaves assigned it the name of 'calamus swords' (pujian ), another effective apotropaic weapon as the hallmarks of the Duanwu, mugwort tigers combined with calamus swords could drive off ghostly and poisonous beings. A ubiquitous ritual in traditional Chinese households consisted of hanging up mugwort twigs and calamus leaves, tied with a red thread, on the top of the main entrance of the home. Local variations included combining those herbs with bitter fleabane (peng ), peach twigs and strings of garlic, and then hanging the bundle on the top of the bed (Qingjia lu, 5.7). Descriptions of such rituals are pervasive in novels like the seminal eighteenth-century 'Dream of the Red Chamber' (Hongloumeng ; trans. [Joly 2010](#ref31_40): ch. 31), while legends about the sacred relationship between mugwort and calamus continue to circulate in China today. Oral accounts collected among the people of Yuanling county, Hunan province, in the early 2000s, tell how in high antiquity a water monster was trying to submerge farmlands so as to put them under his control. Afraid that this would harm the locals, celestial immortals employed mugwort and calamus as weapons against the dreadful monster. The immortals won and spared the creature under the condition that he would never again cause trouble to their descendants, [ 3 ](#fn31_3) marking the locals' houses with the same mugwort and calamus leaves they employed in the battle. Then, the Duanwu day came. Riding a wave all the way in, to his chagrin the ravenous monster only found a few unmarked houses. Later, people learnt that mugwort and calamus terrified diabolic monsters, wicked bandits and poisonous creatures, and transmitted these rituals to posterity ( [Liu 2014](#ref31_47): 165-6). The Qingming has for millennia been another important date for the astrological use of herbs. Known in English as the Tomb-Sweeping Day, on the Qingming Chinese families clean the tombs of their ancestors, worshipping and making ritual offerings to them. Contrary to the Duanwu, whose date is calculated according to the cycles of the moon, the Qingming falls on the first day of the fifth solar term. In the Gregorian calendar, it translates as the fifteenth day after the spring equinox, on 4, 5, or 6 April each year. Just as the mugwort and calamus are associated with the Duanwu, on the Qingming it is the willow tree which takes centre stage. An eighteenth-century gazetteer describes some rituals families from the Yangwu county, Henan province, performed on the Qingming. As an act of communal worship, in the early morning locals would move spirit tablets and statues from their private shrines to open altars especially set up in front of willow trees, hanging up bundles of willow twigs on the top of the main entrance of their residences. The purpose of these rituals was to protect one's home against evil in all its forms ( [Yangwu xian zhi](#ref31_23) , 3.3). 'the tree that terrifies ghosts', willow wood could be carved into apotropaic amulets, a practice that can be traced back to the sixth century ( [Qimin yaoshu](#ref31_16) , 5.12-13), or into an arsenal of ritual weapons employed against demonic creatures on hungry ghost festivals. Its sacred qualities have been consolidated in the gracious image of Guanyin , the most beloved bodhisattva in Chinese Buddhism, using a willow branch to sprinkle blessing water upon humankind. Other important astrological dates included the Spring Festival, or Chinese New Year, as well as the third day of the third month, sixth day of the sixth month, seventh day of the seventh month and ninth day of the ninth month of the Chinese lunisolar calendar. The Spring Festival lasts from the evening preceding the first day of the year until the Lantern Festival, which falls on the eighteenth day, and it is marked by the beginning of the new moon between late January and late February each year. By taking a bath with a decoction of wolfberries on the New Year's Eve, and then repeating the procedure on the first, second, eighth, thirteenth, fifteenth and twentieth days of the New Year's first month, one could prevent disease and attract good luck in the upcoming year ( [Yashang zhaizun shengba jian](#ref31_24) , 5.23). And the ritual burning of weed boats, believed to have the power of 'burning up' bad karma, had to be performed in a river on the eighteenth day of the New Year's first month (Yueling cuipian, 4.35). Given their antiquity, it is hard today to make firm claims about why and how certain herbs became associated with particular dates of the Chinese traditional calendar, although some believe those dates mark the death of legendary or historical figures ( [Yan 2017](#ref31_57): 231-44). [...] and, respectfully abiding by the Heavenly principles and for the terror of ghosts and demons, the Yellow Thearch suddenly realised that characters are numinous.( [Zhuyouke zhibing qishu 2) This passage embodies the essence of talismanic healing: characters are sacred entities imbued with healing power. Known as fu in Chinese, talismans are artefacts composed of characters and symbols written in a certain fashion and used for healing or apotropaic purposes. Talismans can assume multiple forms and are not supposed to be read by humans; rather they serve as a writ through which humans communicate with, or give commands to, the spirit world ( [Bumbacher 2014](#ref31_33); [Junqueira 2021](#ref31_41)). Recent archaeological discoveries have shown that talismans and spells - the verbal aspect of talismans - have been used in China for, at least, the past two millennia ( [Harper 2015](#ref31_38)). When the first Chinese imperial medical institutions emerged around the sixth century CE, talismans and spells were soon incorporated as officially sponsored medical disciplines alongside drugs and massage, a status they enjoyed until the late sixteenth century ( [Junqueira 2018a](#ref31_42); [Cho 2005](#ref31_35)). Despite the fierce debates around the legitimacy of talismanic healing and its place vis-\u00e0-vis orthodox medical traditions, talismans and spells remained pervasive among both scholarly and folk healers in traditional China ( [Junqueira 2021](#ref31_41), [2018a](#ref31_42)). Given the prominence of herbs in post-sixteenth-century Chinese medical traditions ( [Leung 2003](#ref31_45)), it is not surprising that talismans developed an intimacy with the herbal world. A mid-nineteenth-century talismanic manuscript preserved at Shanghai Library offers some of the most comprehensive accounts on the connection between talismans and herbs in Chinese medicine. Before creating a talisman, the healer should hold his brush or seal and, with a pure and sincere heart, invoke the Heavenly Physician (Tianyi ) through herbal incense. Breathing in pure qi, he then draws talismans on rice or bamboo paper while uttering secret spells. The talismans are then burned, and their ashes mixed with a decoction prepared with pure water and three qian of each herb stated in the recipe. [ 4 ](#fn31_4) Herbs, it concludes, are used to guide (yin ) the talismanic energy inside the patient's body, helping deliver its occult message to internal and external deities ( [Zhuyouke](#ref31_30) , 3). Prior to creating a talisman, the healer should identify if the disease belongs to yin or yang. When the patients have trouble in speaking and their feet and hands are cold, this is the sign of a yin-syndrome, and one should create the talisman mixing ginger juice with black ink. When the person's body itches and he or she feels alternations of pain, this is the sign of a yang-syndrome, and the ink must instead be mixed with rice vinegar. Should the person be afflicted by skin diseases, the healer could create the talisman directly onto the injured area, drawing a circle around it and then applying lard and herbs on its top. If after drinking the talismanic potion the person vomits, feels hot or acts as if possessed, these are all signs the treatment was successful (Zhuyouke, 3). The inclusion of herbal decoctions in talismanic treatments and the admonition to identify syndromes based on the principles of yin-yang might have been attempts by post-sixteenth-century healers to reintegrate talismans into orthodox medical traditions. The writing style of healing talismans can be divided into two main categories: secret characters are talismans often composed of the radicals shang (to be in charge of) or yu (thunder) at the top, and gui (ghost) or shi (to eat) at the bottom. Other characters can be added depending on the disease the talisman is expected to cure. For a difficult labour, a talisman composed of the radicals shang, ge (to change) and shi should be burned into ashes and taken by the woman together with a decoction of rice or motherwort (yimucao ) (Zhuyouke, 5). And for nocturnal emissions, a talisman formed of shang, yu (arrow), yuan (primordial) and a variant of the character gui could be employed; here, the talismanic ashes should be ingested with a decoction of soft rush (dengxinocao ), a herbaceous flowering plant traditionally used as a repellent for mosquitoes and flies or as wicks in household lamps (Zhuyouke, 27). Figure 31.1 Example of twelve 'secret characters' (on the left). Miben Shanghai: , 1.n.p). This method thus serves as a contrast to the use of artemisia against n\u00fce by the Daoist alchemist Ge Hong, whose cold-washing technique was an inspiration for the modern nobel prize-winner Tu Youyou ( [Chapter 51](/doi/10.4324/9780203740262-59) in this volume). Contrary to secret characters, elaborate talismans have no fixed pattern. They are usually created by the combination of stylish characters, ancient scripts and occult symbols, and then activated by mudras and verbal spells. Whereas the creation of elaborate talismans often requires lengthy rituals of purification, consecration and invocation, their application does not differ much from secret characters. A rare five-volume manuscript once kept in the Emperor Qianlong's (1711-1799) imperial library, and now held in the National Central Library, Taiwan, records hundreds of elaborate healing talismans. A ritual against plague begins with the purification of ritual implements - yellow paper, brush and cinnabar - followed by the invocation of the Heavenly Generals Ding Chengzong and Xu Shiheng using two talismans. The healer should then draw, consecutively, three other talismans: one to suppress, one to confine and one to slash plague demons. While the last two talismans must be pasted on the home's walls and main entrance, the former three had to be burned and swallowed with a decoction of Chinese dates or tea leaves (Zhuyouke mijue qishu, 1.94-5). The manuscript's third volume divides elaborate talismans into thirteen categories of illness - like children, adults, sense organs and so forth. [ 5 ](#fn31_5) Each category is ruled by a deity invoked through herbal incense, talismans and spells prior to the creation of each healing talisman. After the invocatory ritual, the pattern to draw talismans remains virtually unchanged: each talisman must be written in cinnabar on strips of yellow paper, activated by a spell, burned to ashes and mixed with herbs. A talisman for congested throat, for instance, should be taken with a decoction of mugwort (ai ), while for huoluan another talisman should be ingested with a decoction a condition in which the individual feels 'a frequent urge to urinate, with the urine dribbling and failing to completely leave the body' ( [Zhang](#ref31_58) and Unschuld 2015: 316), talismanic ingested with the juice of three-leaf clover flowers, whereas for mouth ulcers, it should be combined with a decoction of apricot kernel and used for rinsing (Zhuyouke mijue qishu, 3.64, 59). In the same way that herbal decoctions assisted the circulation of talismanic essence inside the body, talismans could also maximise the healing power of herbs. A ritual pervasive in talismanic manuscripts involves invoking the Heavenly Physician (Tianyi ) through the burning of incense and talismans; at midnight, the God, accompanied by his divine troops, would then descend on the altar dedicated to him and bless the herbs displayed thereon ( [Figure 31.3](#fig31_3)) (Zhuyouke: preface, n.p.). Another ritual comprises drawing, printing or carving talismans in clay bottles, peach wooden boxes or calabashes; the physician then fills the container with medicine, whose therapeutic potency is increased by the talismans' numinous power ( [Figure 31.4](#fig31_4)). Figure 31.3 Altar for the Heavenly Physician. The sixteenth-century statue at the centre is Shennong, the God of Medicine and Agriculture. He is surrounded by talismans, medicinal jars and ritual objects, with herbs displayed in front of him for blessing. Photo by author 14 November 2019, private altar, Shanghai Figure 31.4 Nineteenth-century medicinal jar inscribed with talismans. Such jars are filled with medicinal herbs and then placed in the altar for the Heavenly Physician to bestow upon them His blessings. This ritual, still pervasive among Chinese folk healers today, is believed to maximise the healing power of herbs. Photo by author 14 November 2019, private altar, Shanghai Herbs did not act simply as guides but also as a physical support for the creation of talismans. First, most of the talismans should be written on rice or bamboo paper. Second, as a divine writing, talismans had their origin ascribed to deities, who bestowed them upon humans by means of spirit-possession, dreams or revelations in the natural realm - which, in traditional China, was itself holy. Local gazetteers show that herbs have long served as a material support for the divine revelation of talismans. The seventeenth-century [Tanghu qiaoshu](#ref31_22) (Book of Tanghu), a collection of personal notes compiled by Lai Jizhi (1604-1682), describes how in Leshan , Sichuan province, there was once a tree whose leaves grew veins in the form of talismanic writing, while in a neighbouring area, Mount Rongzi , there was another sacred plant whose leaves resembled those from lychee trees yet their veins featured the pattern of the worm-seal, a script commonly used for talismans. Locals from Guangdong and Hubei provinces also discovered that the 'talismanic leaves' (yefu ) of bamboos, which had been found emerging from sacred altars, stones and caves could serve as weapons to suppress the evil, ward off snakes or heal disease (Tanghu qiaoshu, 12.29-33) Heals Disease'. This drawing depicts an ancient divine tree and its two girl-spirits (on the left) in Hanling village, Ningbo, in the late nineteenth century. When falling sick, villagers would pray and burn incense to the tree. Its wondrous healing powers led locals to erect a special temple for its worshipping. Dianshizhai huabao (Illustrated Lithographer), vol. 4 upper, (1884-1889): 1 The carving of talismans in peach wood long history ( [Lu 2012](#ref31_50); [Yan 2017](#ref31_57): 230-1). For centuries, the Chinese praised the peach tree as the primus inter pares among the 'five kinds of trees' - namely, the and willow ( [Taiping yulan](#ref31_21) , 967.2). While its wood was used to carve talismans, sacred statues and exorcistic weapons, its kernels were effective for a difficult labour - the Chuanya waibian, a late eighteenth- or early nineteenth-century recipe manuscript, describes how one simply had to split a peach pit into two, write the characters ke (can) on the one side and chu (out) on the other, and give it to the pregnant woman; the baby would then be delivered immediately (Chuanya waibian, 1.n.p.). Peach roots, leaves, resin and fruits all also possessed apotropaic qualities. Peach twigs were hung on walls or the tops of windows, doors and gates so as to chase away malevolent forces and, when boiled with water, could serve as a preventive bath against epidemics (Chuanya waibian, 1.n.p.). Peach trees stuck by lightning were cherished for their exceptional quality of warding off the evil; the talismans carved from their wood, known as 'peach talismans' (taofu ), embodied the numinous essence of the thunder gods. These talismans could then be worn as protective amulets, transformed into ritual seals or prepared as decoctions to treat heart and abdominal pain, spirit-possession and blood-related ailments (Suishi guangji, 21.21). In Chinese medicine, jinshu or jinfa (incantations) comprise a broad category of healing techniques underpinned by the view that there are occult powers in the world that people can harness and manipulate in a myriad of ways. Distinguishing from the same Chinese term jin which elsewhere in this volume specifically refers to, and we translate as, 'prohibitions' ( [Chapter 19](/doi/10.4324/9780203740262-23) in this volume), in this context jin refers to the category of 'incantations'. 'Incantations' include a wide range of written talismans, as well as verbal spells and household rituals in which herbs - in their various forms - often constitute the central component for healing. Stories about the manipulation of the occult power of herbs, for instance, pervade traditional medical histories. The eighteenth-century [Mingyi lei'an](#ref31_15) (Medical Cases from Famous Physicians) records the story of Gongsun Tai , a wealthy old man from 'ancient times' whose back suffered from yongju (abscess and ulceration), a skin condition that conventional drugs and acupuncture were unable to treat. Xue Bozong , who had mastered the esoteric arts of 'disease transfer' (yibing ), then used his own qi to close the wound and transferred it onto a willow tree nearby. The next day, the carbuncle began to vanish, while a tumour of the size of a fist appeared in the willow. A couple of weeks later, thick yellowish-red pus emerged from the tumour as if it were festering; the tree then withered and Gongsun was finally healed (Mingyi lei'an, 10.5). While Shennong , the God of Medicine and Agriculture, ingested a herb that made his belly transparent so as to observe the effect of other herbs on internal organs, the divine physician Bian Que received a secret recipe that allowed him to see through walls and the human body. Today, folk healers continue to celebrate Xue's art of 'disease transfer', as well as Shennong and Bian Que's 'see-through vision' with highest esteem and as examples of the antiquity, ubiquity and efficacy of incantations in behind incantations is not always clear, the constant criticism they received from scholar-physicians leads us to presume incantations did not comply with the orthodox interpretation of medical classics. Recent studies have demonstrated that the likelihood of finding incantations in folk medical manuscripts is far higher than in printed medical books ( [Chapter 18](/doi/10.4324/9780203740262-21) in this volume; [Unschuld](#ref31_55) and Zheng 2012: 154-75). This fact should not come as a surprise considering that printed books are the final product of careful compilation and editing efforts by Chinese intellectuals who often condemned, if not simply neglected, the existence of incantations ( [Junqueira 2018b](#ref31_43)). Manuscripts, therefore, offer the most fascinating records for the study of healing incantations. The Chuanya (Corrected Recipes of Itinerant Healers), a nineteenth-century recipe text, represents a scholarly attempt to incorporate certain folk incantations into orthodox medicine. A substantial portion of the Chuanya comprises recipes and techniques collected from folk healers (caoze yi ), literally 'physicians of grasses and swamps'. Divided into two parts, the second volume dedicates roughly one-third of its content to incantations, with drugs' (yaoxi ), comprises techniques itinerant healers employed to attract their clientele's attention, including potions to suppress appetite when undertaking hard work, wines to foresee the future and powders to create dreams. Whereas 'incantations with characters' resembles the talismans analysed in the previous section of this chapter, 'arts and incantations' includes verbal spells and simple household rituals against demons, beasts and insects. To prevent or heal tui , a disease that affects genital organs, hang a couple of eggplants on top of the main door and always glance at them when entering or leaving the house. And a recipe to chase away mosquitoes requires that in the midday of the Duanwu, one stares at the sun and, while holding a bunch of soft rush, recites 'in Heaven there is a golden chicken who eats the brain and marrow of mosquitoes'; after this, the person breathes in the qi from the sun, blows it on the soft rushes and lights them at night (Chuanya waibian, 1.n.p.). The section 'incantations with drugs' accounts for recipes wherein minerals, animals and herbs, ritually empowered, are the main components. To keep mosquitoes away from a new home, for instance, during the construction period one must bury a cattail leaf fan (pushan ) underneath the four main pillars that sustain the house, whereas to ward off evil spirits, stone tiles should be buried beneath the four corners of the house and then beaten on their top with seven peach pits (Chuanya waibian, 1.n.p.). Most of the recipes in this section are relatively easy to put into practice and only require everyday herbs. To make a child stop crying at night, a father should pick herbs located close to a well and hide them, without the mother knowing, under his child's mat; alternatively, the well's herbs could be replaced with twigs and leaves from a chicken coop or pigsty. And to heal a child's abdominal pain, the father must pick any herbs growing from a tree's hollow and stealthily place them on the roof of the house (Chuanya waibian, 1.n.p.). These last two recipes demonstrate that the exact kind of herb was not as important as the ritual manipulation of the same. The oral nature of folk healing knowledge makes it difficult to clarify the original rationale behind the ritual use of the herbs contained in the Chuanya. The reason is that, just as in medieval and early-modern Europe ( [Davies 2007](#ref31_36)), in traditional China the image of folk and itinerant healers remained rather controversial. Praised by some as living repositories of medical knowledge, others despised them as chief vectors of medical heterodoxy who only cared about how to make a profit out of the na\u00efve ( [Wang 2013](#ref31_56)). Traditional biographies depict the divine physician Bian Que, considered the father of Chinese medicine, and Zhang Congzheng (1156-1228), known as one of the greatest physicians of the Jin-Yuan period (1115-1368), as itinerant healers. Their stories raise questions about the social competition between learnt and itinerant physicians, and whether they were composed thus as rhetorical attempts to criticise the arrogance of scholar-physicians, rather than a celebration of folk healers. The controversial picture of folk healers is best manifested in the notes of the nineteenth-century physician Mao Duishan regarding the fish seller Li Bo . When Li was a child, a couple of tiny lumps appeared on the back of his feet but, since the pain was not severe, he simply ignored them. On a hot summer day, however, Li's feet began to turn so reddish and swollen that it caught the attention of an itinerant healer who was passing by. The healer then warned Li: This is not xuanjie -illness (a general term for parasitic skin rash). The poison has infected the yangming channels for very long. It is now time to treat it with external medicine, otherwise the disease will turn into intestine ulcers (changju ) and you will lose your feet. [Mao Duishan yihua](#ref31_14), n.p.) This is not xuanjie -illness (a general term for parasitic skin rash). The poison has infected the yangming channels for very long. It is now time to treat it with external medicine, otherwise the disease will turn into intestine ulcers (changju ) and you will lose your feet.( Tragically, Li Bo's father did not believe the itinerant healer. A few days passed, the disease broke out again and, because conventional drugs were unable to heal him, Li Bo lost his feet. Mao concluded this anecdote arguing that, although most itinerant healers were charlatans, their drug and talismanic knowledge was worth preserving due to its proven therapeutic effectiveness. The widespread condemnation of itinerant healers overshadowed their sporadic appraisal in printed medical literature ( [Junqueira 2018b](#ref31_43); [Unschuld](#ref31_55) and Zheng 2012: 73-106). Scholar-physicians criticised them for not understanding the true principles of medical classics - or even worse, for distorting their 'real meaning'- and for adopting all kinds of illicit means to make a profit: from producing and selling fake medicine to bragging about mysterious recipes that promised wondrous results. Indeed, the Chuanya records several of these recipes. To reduce thirst when walking long miles, one should grind sugar, bai fuling (white Poria cocos), mint (bohe ) and liquorice (gancao ) into powder, mix it with honey, and mould the mixture into pills to be taken once a day. Pills made of hemp seeds (damazi ), calamus and parturition blood, if taken every morning for a hundred days, allowed one to see ghosts. Rubbed on one's hands, a fragrant potion made of dried flowers and liquid honey was believed to attract a kaleidoscope of butterflies around the healer, a shimmering spectacle used to captivate potential customers by showing the healer's wondrous powers (Chuanya waibian, 1.n.p.). Yet, a few records also illustrate how itinerant healers employed poisonous herbs to induce disease in someone who was initially healthy: ashes of 'snake mushroom' (shexun ) (mantuojiu ) to induce insanity (liudian ), and in remedies supposed to improve the spleen, they instead added dew of pawpaw (mugualu ) to weaken the patient's body ( [Chuanya neibian](#ref31_7) , personal preface). Folk medical manuscripts record dozens of secret drug recipes itinerant healers used to cheat, attract or gain the trust of their clientele, behaviour scholar-physicians and its myriad of herbal treatments are central aspects of folk healing. But here, again, scholarly and folk healers did not agree on its pathological nature. The folk belief - which, we might assume, most of the Chinese embraced - associated possession with entering old, abandoned temples or being suddenly attacked by the evil while wandering around forests, mountains and valleys ( [Yixue zhengzhuan](#ref31_26) , 1.30). Scholar-physicians, on the other hand, explained the aetiology of spirit-possession from the perspective of the medical classics. The scholar-physician Xu Dachun (1693-1771), for example, did not reject the idea that ghosts and demons could harm humans but rather argued that only those with a weak essence, spirit and qi would be affected. Whereas talismans and spells could occasionally prove effective, physicians should rather employ drugs to heal the root cause of spirit-possession - which, he believed, resulted from an internal of the scholarly medical debates on spirit-possession between the sixteenth and twentieth centuries ( [Junqueira illustrates such debates. it dedicates an entire chapter to xiesui , a category of diseases attributed to demons and poisonous insects. After echoing Xu's words, the chapter lists over twenty recipes against xiesui, all of which are based on minerals, animals and especially herbs. Pills to treat illnesses caused by fox-spirits who dwell in valleys are made of a complex mixture of thirteen ingredients, nine of which are herbs, including ginseng, young peach fruits and burning bush (guijianyu ). After being wrapped in gold foil, the patient takes a few pills, together with a decoction of muxiang (Radix Aucklandiae), just before going to bed; but to chase away evil spirits, five or seven pills must be kept in a small crimson bag and hung on top of the bed. For madness caused by malicious ghosts or fox-spirits, a recipe combines principles of acupuncture and herbal medicine: the patient's hands must be tied up by the thumb, while dried mugwort is burned onto the area between the nails and cuticle up to seven times; this area, the text reminds us, is known as guikuxue , or 'the point where ghosts sob' (Yixue huihai, 34.38-48). During most of the twentieth century, attempts to modernise Chinese medicine have encouraged the marginalisation of most of the therapies and worldviews explored in this chapter. Astrology, talismans and incantations are now alien to most Chinese medical students. Old medical texts, selected for present-day publication, are carefully edited so as to eradicate their most obvious ritual aspects and shape Chinese medicine as a modern scientific discipline. The only edition of the Chuanya published with a commentary so far, for instance, warns readers that the original text 'contained content at odds with scientific values': as a result, from hundreds of incantations, the editors included only eighteen in their book, despising all rituals and astrological knowledge as 'primitive religious non-sense' [Fujiansheng 1977](#ref31_37): 1-4). Although the 'obsession with scientific accuracy' is a recent phenomenon in modern 2012](#ref31_46): 5; [Chapter 45](/doi/10.4324/9780203740262-53) and [Chapter 51](/doi/10.4324/9780203740262-59) in this volume), the tendency not to transmit certain kinds of knowledge through print is not entirely new in China. The occult use of herbs is more conspicuous in folk manuscripts than in orthodox medical books. Likewise, while deemed as an awkward subject in TCM, the ritual manipulation of herbs has remained essential in folk healing traditions today, with herbs celebrated as mediators between the human, natural and divine worlds. In the contemporary Chinese religious revival, such practices as hanging up mugwort twigs on the top of doors on the Duanwu or making exorcistic weapons out of peach wood are gradually being brought back to life. In late imperial times, herbal ritual knowledge constituted the core of Chinese life, and it is unlikely this will change in the near future.
