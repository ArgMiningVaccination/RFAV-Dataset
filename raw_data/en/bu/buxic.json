To measure whether or not body weight may be a concern for you, measuring your Body Mass Index can be a useful tool. Body mass index (BMI) compares your weight to your height; it is calculated as kilograms per meter squared (kg/m\u00b2). Most of the research we cite defines overweight as a BMI between 25 and 29.9, and obesity as a BMI of 30 or higher. Underweight is a BMI lower than 18.5. Like the researchers we cite, we realize that BMI is not a perfect measure of overweight or obesity, as it doesn't differentiate between lean body mass and excess body fat. But a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is a good indicator of healthy body weight for most people. What can contribute to gain or loss of body weight? Medical conditions Underlying medical conditions or imbalances may lead to an unhealthy body weight. Consider addressing these factors with a trained practitioner, such as an integrative or naturopathic physician.
