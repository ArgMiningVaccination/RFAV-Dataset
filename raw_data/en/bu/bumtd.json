Amidst infodemic of healthcare blogs and expert comments, it is difficult for a common person to decide the correct prevention protocol for COVID-19. COVID-19 poses a low threat at 'individual-level' and highrisk at 'population-level', due to low pathogenicity and high infectivity. Appropriate self-care for disease prevention at individual levels can stop the transmission of disease in the community. Scientific evidence gathered from Allopathy integrated with the age-old wisdom of Ayurveda is the best approach for protection against COVID-19. STRICTLY FOLLOW 'SOCIAL DISTANCING' AND ADOPT' NAMASTE': Social distancing measures need to be followed. As human is a social creature, they need not socially distance themselves from family and friends.'Physical distancing' of at least 6 feet and wearing face masks is mandatory to break the virus transmission chain. As the cycle of life brings new normals by virtue of change, the world needs to adapt to new norms to avoid infections, new ways of life and new forms of human interactions. Now is the time to adopt the 'Namaste' culture to minimize further spread of infections. PERSONAL HYGIENE AND CLEANLINESS MEASURES: As'Cleanliness is next to Godliness'; personal hygiene measures are important. Frequent handwashing is the best way for protection from infections. Appropriate use of soap and water or an alcohol-based (at least 60%) hand sanitizer with scrubbing for at least 20 seconds is mandatory. NON-SPECIFIC 'VIRUS-HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT' TO CREATE LOCAL BARRIER: The innermost lining of our airways (mucosa) has an intrinsic environment, which depends upon degree of acidity/alkalinity, temperature, humidity, and bacterial flora. These factors need to remain in balance to maintain the state of perfect mucosal health which can offer a strong local barrier to Corona-virus. The inciting factors, like excessive exposure to cold and moisture, may lead to their imbalance. The body's response to this imbalance causes inflammation - 'mucositis'. The mucosa becomes vulnerable to the attacks of respiratory pathogens and clinical disease may manifest. Ayurveda suggests several household remedies to maintain the balance of local mucosal factors and perfect mucosal health, which are cheap, easy to perform, and safe. These measures may provide protection against COVID-19. STRONG IMMUNE SYSTEM FOR STRONG SYSTEMIC DEFENSE: Adaptive immunity to Corona-virus is not expected in humans without the vaccines. Till then, prevention against COVID-19 essentially depends on our innate immunity - broad non-specific immune response against all pathogens. Innate immunity is the first line of defense against 2019-nCov. The strength of immunity depends upon genetic composition, nutrition, mental health, and environmental factors. Though we cannot alter the genetics and environmental factors, we can certainly control the nutritional status and mental health. Ayurveda emphasis on the healing powers of Mother Nature and advocates the use of several herbs which can enhance innate immunity. It is important to understand that moderation is the key for the consumption of Ayurvedic herbs. A balanced diet should include prescribed dosage of Vitamin C, Zinc, Vitamin E, Vitamin D, probiotics, proteins, and antioxidants which are known to boost respiratory immunity. The required dosage may also be achieved with use of dietary supplements, but natural sources are always better in terms of bioabsorption and bioavailability. Fresh fruits and vegetables are great sources of essential vitamins, minerals, fibers, and antioxidants. Nuts, seeds, and dry fruits are excellent substitutes for daily snacks and are true 'nature's fast food'. India is the land of spices with a wide variety of spices available in the Indian Kitchen. These aromatic spices are an integral part of conventional Indian cooking. Apart from providing great taste and color to the food, these spices offer enormous health benefits including the anti-microbial actions. With globalization, an increasing number of Indians have adopted western food trends and ignored the goodness of conventional Indian foods. COVID-19 crisis is the time to redefine our priorities and bring appropriate changes in the dietary and cooking habits for a healthy living. \"It is always better to eat food as medicine, than eating medicine as food\". LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS: Lessons from the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic makes it very clear that COVID-19 will remain a cause of concern for at least a year or so till the vaccine is available. Moreover, coronaviruses will still remain in nature with rich reservoirs in bats and rodents and will remain a threat for pandemics in the future. We need to understand the importance of lifestyle choices in determining our innate immunity. This is the time when society needs to act and every individual needs to incorporate a healthy lifestyle and bring lifestyle modifications. It is important to adapt to healthy practices to derive maximum benefits from the nutritious food in our diet. Cut the CRAP [CRAP is the acronym for the foods, which contain empty calories but also contain ingredients that deprive the body of essential nutrients] : AVOID CARBONATED DRINKS, REFINED SUGAR, ARTIFICIAL COLORS & FLAVORS, AND PROCESSED FOOD PRODUCTS. Ensuring optimal hydration is one of the most basic things you can do for your health. Regular exercise develops muscle strength and posture, reduces body fat, improves digestion and sleep, boosts the immune system and may slow the aging processes. Yoga should be performed daily with a combination of stretching exercises and coordinated breathing (Pranayam) along with the persistent practice of 'Mindful Meditation'. This will ensure good physical and mental health which is essential ingredients of strong immune functions. \"Food is the most abused anxiety drug and exercise is the most underutilized antidepressant\". Ayurveda-based prevention protocols cannot be ignored, for the paucity of scientific evidence, if they are backed with science and commonsense. Fresh Air and sunlight have helped humankind during the 1918 Spanish flu and are likely to play a preventive role in COVID-19 as well. Indian healthcare is in the best position to adopt and integrate the best medical practices from the treasure trove of Ayurveda and the clinical excellence of Allopathic Medicine. In fact, India should lead the global humanity in this war against the COVID-19 pandemic and the future pandemic threats with an 'INTEGRATED HEALTHCARE APPROACH'. HEALTHY INDIA will provide a strong foundation for Stronger India and Stronger World. Let's INTEGRATE the best of Allopathy & Ayurveda to fight COVID-19. "}
