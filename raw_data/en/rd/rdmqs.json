So, what exactly is homoeopathy? It is a branch of medicine which is based on The Law of Similars or on the concept of Like cures Like. It works by administering a very minute dose of active ingredient or disease-causing substance in the patient to cure the disease. In a way, it is an advanced form of vaccination. The important factor is that the dose administered is unbelievably minuscule, which renders it absolutely harmless yet very powerful. The idea behind this is that it stimulates the body's own healing mechanisms. Another fact about homoeopathy is that the treatment not only depends on the disease but also on the patient. Two people suffering from the same disease might get prescribed different courses of treatment depending on their unique situation and how their body would respond. Hair and skin are extremely important to most. Who doesn't want luscious locks of thick, black hair? And who would say no to a glowing skin? Reasons for hair problems such as dandruff and [hair loss](https://www.practo.com/healthfeed/is-it-really-dandruff-or-does-it-lead-to-hair-fall-25658/post) may be varied. Hair loss can be caused by stress, pregnancy, lack of protein, heredity, thyroid disorders, hormonal imbalances, and alopecia. [Alopecia Areata](https://www.practo.com/healthfeed/male-pattern-baldness-and-early-warning-signs-25424/post) is a disease which causes hair loss. This is the result of an extra zealous immune system, which mistakes the hair for a foreign object and starts attacking it. Dandruff can also be caused by stress or it may be a side effect of poor health, poor hygiene or excessive intake of sugar, fat, and starch. Dandruff can also, in turn, cause hair loss. Since the reasons can be of a wide range, there is a need to not just treat the single disease. The underlying reasons have to be evaluated. The benefits of the homoeopathic medicine are that homoeopathy treats the person as a whole.
