A person's attitudes, beliefs, and outlook can all affect physical health. And physical health also can impact mental and emotional well-being. By being aware of the connection and learning new ways to connect these areas, a person can learn to optimize their overall wellness and health. Uniting mind and body Mind-body therapy is a way to improve the link between mental and physical health. By doing so, you may find untapped resources within yourself that may enhance your general health and mental outlook. The power of suggestion is key to this type of therapy. A therapist may give suggestions that can help you better unite mind with body. Some therapists use a biofeedback machine that uses sensory feedback from the body allowing first hand observation of the effect that the mind has on the physical body. The way you receive the suggestion matters less than what it teaches you about how to relax. A relaxed mind and body are key to this therapy. In fact, enhanced relaxation is often a main goal of therapy.
