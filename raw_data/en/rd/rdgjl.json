Soon we will all be able to take a deep breath and begin to resume some activities that we have had to do without for more than a year. Our Licensing Specialists continue to do an incredible job of visiting children's centers and homes while employing safety precautions to keep you, your family child care home and themselves safe. They now have the new Standard Classifications that address all the new Regulations that went into effect in April 2020, in their tablets and laptops. These Standards were emailed to you and are available on our website, www.pclb.org . Please be sure to familiarize yourself with them - they are a list of everything that you can be cited for as a violation. If you are unfamiliar with what a requirement in a certain area is, I urge you to make sure that you are familiar with our Licensing Regulations Governing Pinellas County Family Child Care Homes and Large Family Child Care Homes. I advise reading one section at a time and tabbing areas that you may need to refer to often. You can also reach out to your Li- censing Specialist for clarification. One big change for Large Family Child Care Homes is that by 6/12/21 the employee must have current First Aid and CPR (pediatric). First Aid and CPR may be taken online, but CPR must have an \"in person\" assessment/skills test. This can be found on page 19 in the regulations. As progress is made, the CDC is modifying their guidelines often and State of Florida and Pinellas County officials have been re -examining emergency orders and mandates. We emailed you on May 5, 2021, to let you know that the Pinellas County mask mandate and state of emergency had ended. As a business entity, you may still require face coverings of staff or visitors. However, State of Emergency Li- censing Regulations have ended and you must follow Pinellas County Licensing requirements in all areas. We have weathered a storm that thankfully does not seem to come but once in a centu- ry. While many of us have suffered personal loss, been ill ourselves or been isolated from friends and family, it is my hope that we can begin to move forward. We need to understand that adults and children alike have had a life -altering year, and many have experienced a level of stress that they have never had before. Now more than ever, it is essential that we support one another, spread hope and positivity and continue the strong commitment to quality child care that has been evident in our child care community. We thank you for all that you do every single day, and encourage you to take a breath of fresh air and recharge. ornoff's Bulletin Board Faith Bornoff, M.Ed. Executive Director Lisa Zacharia A Breath of Fresh Air 1 Bornoff's Bulletin Board 1 News from Epidemiology 2 Product Recalls 3 Creative Corner 4 Staff Spotlight 5 S o the state of emergency is over, the mask ordinance is rescind- ed, and now what? Everything just goes back to \"normal\" over- night, right? Well, we all know it's never that easy! It seems there is always a shortage of something these days, and most recently that shortage in the Family Child Care Home industry has been children needing care. Some of this may be due to family re- sponsibilities such as an older sibling who is virtual learning at home or a parent who is caring for a vulnerable loved one and cannot not yet return to the work force. It is hard to say when the Family Home Child Care industry will see an uptick in enrollment but until then, don't forget about the families you have right now! Let's take every opportunity to thank them for their perseverance, hard work and dedication to their children during this unexpected pandemic experience. Here are three low -cost ideas to show families what they mean to you: Leave notes or cards in their child's diaper bag they can discover later telling them how terrific they are. Prepare a bulletin board in your home and post positive experiences and interactions between you and them praising parents and letting them know what a wonderful job they are doing. Email pictures of the children to the parents. They say, \"It takes a Village!\" Remind the parents of the children how essential they are to you, their children and to their family. Tell them they are doing a good job! On that note, it is my turn to tell you how amazing you are! Without you, the families in our community could not return to work and know that their child is well taken care of. Your hard work allows the community return to \"normal.\" Thank you for all that you do and have continued to do through- out the past year. We are on the upswing and look forward to returning to the pre -pandemic lifestyle we have all missed. 2 QUARTERLY NEWS! Child Care Licensing Program Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County QUARTERLY NEWS! Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County NEWS FROM EPIDEMIOLO GY This virus will find ways to survive and spread unless we can close off transmission pathways. Evidence is building that our current vaccines might block transmission of SARS -CoV -2, therefore vaccinating children could help us achieve herd immunity across all age groups. these children participating in the trials were given detailed information about the risks and benefits of these trials prior to giving their consent for their child to participate. Pfizer recently released preliminary data from their Phase 3 clinical trial of 2,260 participants aged 12 -15 years old. This data suggests 100% efficacy in a small sample size with a strong immune system response and tolera- ble safety profile compared to previous trial data in those 16 -25 years of age. Pfizer is also enrolling for a Phase 1/2/3 trial in children 6 -months to 11 years old. Following suit, Moderna has announced the beginning of their Phase 2/3 trial of 6,750 pediatric participants aged 6 -months to 12 years to assess the dosing, safety, and efficacy of their vaccine in children. An important difference between the clinical trials in adults versus children will be the number of participants available to calculate the effectiveness. Since infections and severe outcomes are rare in children, these studies will have only a few thousand participants when compared to the adult trials with tens of thousands. Given that the study size will be too small to outright calculate efficacy, researchers will be comparing immune system markers and antibody titers from blood samples to those from the adult trials to judge efficacy. This difference means that scientists will be primarily focus- ing on the safety of these vaccines in children. They want to ensure that these vaccines do not cause any significant adverse events or \"enhanced disease\" if they later became infected. The adult trials found no evidence for this, but researchers are looking closely at immune system markers to make sure these events do not occur. As data is released in the coming months, the scientific community has a duty to parents, families, and com- munities to demonstrate reputable scientific practice that holds safety and efficacy of these vaccines in children to the highest standards. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2034765 O ver the last year, rising case counts, hospitalizations, deaths, and socioeconomic upheaval shifted our hopes towards a vaccine being our way out of the pandemic. As vaccines rolled -out to our highest risk individuals, we began to look forward to returning to normal life. Cur- rently, the available vaccines are authorized for use in those 12 and older for the Pfizer vaccine. Johnson & Johnson and Moderna still do not have approval for anyone under the age of 18. Since nearly a quarter of the United States population is under 18 years old, these vaccine manufactur- ers have sought to provide rigorously tested, safe, and efficacious vaccines for children. The benefits of vaccinating children benefits are both direct, protection against severe disease and complications, and indirect, protect- ing others by reducing spread. These indirect benefits can also decrease stress put on families by the pandemic and encourage children to return to daily activities, such as school and sports, that allow them to socialize with people outside their homes. Not only do parents and caregivers require robust safety data, including pediatric -focused studies and post licensure monitoring for potential rare outcomes, they need societal decision making that prioritizes their chil- dren's safety. In the context of COVID -19, current data suggests that SARS -CoV-2 infections occur in children at a lower rate and typically without severe outcomes. Children, particularly younger kids, aren't necessarily super -spreaders of SARS -CoV-2, like they are for Influenza, but the emer- gence of faster -spreading variants, along with rising adult vaccination rates, means that children and adolescents might soon be contributing more to spread. This virus will find ways to survive and spread unless we can close off transmission pathways. Evidence is building that our current vaccines might block transmission of SARS -CoV-2, therefore vaccinating children could help us achieve herd immunity across all age groups. To address this issue - Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson have all began implementing COVID -19 vaccine clinical trials specifically to demon- strate proper dosing, safety, and efficacy in these pediatric populations. In these trials, it will be critical for these manufacturers to maintain transpar- ency and a thorough scientific vetting process. How will these trials work? In some ways, these trials will mimic the early trials we did in adults, where participants received a range of doses to find one that triggers a strong immune response without very many side effects. Once we figure out a \"sweet spot\" for a dose, then we will enroll more children to either receive the full dose regimen or a placebo, a harmless injection that we use as a control to compare its effects against the testing group. Researchers will follow this group for months or even years to study the safety and effective- ness of the vaccines.
