This year, send your child to school with a non-toxic lunch box. It's frustrating that a large portion of lunch gear sold in stores and online is loaded with harmful and toxic chemicals. These chemicals can leach into food, on food contact surfaces and onto the hands of your kids as they touch and handle the lunchbox. According to the EPA report on [America's Children and the Environment](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-06/documents/ace3_2013.pdf), certain environmental contaminants may affect children disproportionately since their bodies and organs are still growing and developing.

I've found a variety of safe lunchboxes, lunch bags and stainless steel bentos, that are free from harmful chemicals like PVC, lead, phthalates and BPA.

Lead residing in the outer material can be wiped off onto children's hands and food. The [Center For Environmental Health](https://www.ceh.org/)(CEH) tested more than 150 lunchboxes for the presence of lead. Of those tested, about 10 percent contained \"high levels\" of lead. The [CEH](http://pvcinformation.org/assets/pdf/PbCdChildrenProducts.pdf)now advises parents not to buy vinyl lunchboxes or to test lunchboxes that their kids already have. In another study, forty lunch boxes were tested with a rapid lead test solution and 14 (35%) were positive, confirming the frequent presence of lead. [The Consumer Product Safety Information Act](https://www.cpsc.gov/Business--Manufacturing/Business-Education/Lead/Total-Lead-Content-Business-Guidance-and-Small-Entity-Compliance-Guide)(CPSI) mandated that as of November 15, 2012, products designed or intended primarily for children aged 12 and younger cannot contain more than .009 ppm of lead. Although the amount of lead found in soft vinyl lunch boxes is not enough to cause acute lead poisoning, it may be enough to contribute to health problems, including learning and developmental problems, nausea, fatigue, headache, hyperactivity, and brain and nerve damage. - PVC- PVC (aka Polyvinyl Chloride or vinyl) is a flexible plastic used widely kids lunch gear. It can contain harmful chemicals like lead, phthalates and BPA/BPS/BPF. Aside from the human health impacts, PVC is an environmental pollutant. During various stages of [PVC production](http://pvcinformation.org/assets/pdf/PbCdChildrenProducts.pdf)and disposal, dioxins and mercury are released into our air, water and soil. [Dioxin](http://pvcinformation.org/assets/pdf/PbCdChildrenProducts.pdf)is a well-known carcinogen and can affect the reproductive, immune, endocrine and neurological systems. - Phthalates- Phthalates make PVC soft and pliable. A 2012 study by the [Center for Health, Environment and Justice](http://chej.org/2012/08/27/senator-chuck-schumer-get-toxic-phthalates-out-of-childrens-school-supplies/)detected phthalates in 80% of school supplies, including lunch boxes. 75% of the school supplies contained phthalate levels so high, they would not be legal to sell if they were toys. Phthalates can easily leach into food and drinks from containers due to the weak bonds they form with the plastic. [Phthalates](http://pvcinformation.org/assets/pdf/PbCdChildrenProducts.pdf)have been linked to a variety of [health concerns](http://pvcinformation.org/assets/pdf/PbCdChildrenProducts.pdf), including asthma, endocrine disruption, impacts to reproductive systems and some forms of cancer. A [study from the Center for Health, Environment & Justice](http://chej.org/2012/08/27/senator-chuck-schumer-get-toxic-phthalates-out-of-childrens-school-supplies/)found that all the children's lunch boxes tested contained up to 30 times the amount of toxic chemicals (chemicals known as phthalates) deemed safe by the federal government. - BPA, BPS and BPF- PVC may also contain traces of the endocrine-disrupting chemical Bisphenol-A (BPA). BPA is an endocrine disrupting chemical, which means it interacts with hormones in the body. A [2018 study](https://doi.org/10.1210/js.2018-00151)linked BPA with significant changes in insulin response levels, and a 2019 study found a positive association between BPA and coronary heart disease ( [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310111)). Plastic containers labeled \"BPA-free\" don't necessarily mean they're any safer. They may contain other [bisphenols](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31310111), such as BPS or BPF, which have the same harmful properties as BPA. A recent study linked [exposure to bisphenols](https://www.endocrine.org/news-and-advocacy/news-room/2019/exposure-to-common-chemicals-in-plastics-linked-to-childhood-obesity)in plastics to childhood obesity. Even bisphenol-free plastics may contain other [endocrine-disrupting chemicals](https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/84/2/249/1692264). - Microban- If your lunchbox contains Microban, it will clearly state this on the label. None of the lunchboxes listed below contain Microban. Microban is a proprietary mix of chemicals that may contain [Triclosan](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6126357/), an endocrine-disrupting chemical that can cause bacterial resistance. Microban is engineered to protect products from bacteria, mold and in some cases algae that can cause stains, odors and product deterioration. Microban protection is not designed to protect users from disease causing microorganisms. If you're concerned about viruses and bacteria on your child's lunchbox, please visit the lunchbox cleaning and disinfecting tips at the end of this post. How To Disinfect A Lunchbox High quality insulated and cloth lunchboxes should be able to tolerate the washing machine on the gentle cycle with cool water and a small amount of natural, fragrance-free detergent. Check the care instructions or revisit the website where you bought the lunchbox for more cleaning details. If you have a stainless steel bento, that can go right in the dishwasher. How To Hand Wash A Lunchbox: - Fill a sink with warm water and add a small amount of dish detergent. There's no need to use antimicrobial soap. Plain soap breaks down the fatty layer surrounding virus and bacteria particles, destabilizing them. Also, a vigorous scrubbing and rinsing with water will wash them away. - Submerge the lunchbox in the soapy water and agitate to mix. - Scrub the interior and exterior with a clean washcloth, sponge or toothbrush. - Rinse with running water and dry with a towel. - Allow the lunchbox to air dry completely before using again. To [Disinfect](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/disinfection/disinfection-methods/chemical.html) The Lunchbox Without Washing: - Spray the interior and exterior with [Force of Nature](https://www.forceofnatureclean.com/ref/umbel/)Spray and let sit for 10 minutes. - Mix equal parts vinegar and water in a spray bottle and spray the interior and exterior of the lunchbox. This will disinfect and deodorize (the vinegar smell disappears when it dries). - Pour 70% rubbing alcohol (ethanol or isopropyl) in spray bottle. Spray all over the lunchbox and let it sit for 30 seconds. - Pour 3% hydrogen peroxide in an opaque spray bottle, spray the lunchbox let sit for 5 minutes. [Force of Nature](https://www.forceofnatureclean.com/ref/umbel/) is a broad-spectrum disinfectant and sanitizer that's EPA registered for use in hospitals, ICUs, daycares, schools, veterinary clinics, gyms, restaurants & more. It kills 99.9% of germs: Staph, MRSA, Norovirus, Influenza A, Salmonella, and Listeria. How does it work? Salt, water and vinegar are converted to electrolyzed water when an electrical current changes the chemical composition of the solution into two new ingredients. The [Force of Nature](https://www.forceofnatureclean.com/ref/umbel/) Starter Kit contains: Electrolyzer with power cord (compatible with any household electrical outlet), Spray Bottle (12 oz), 5 Activator Capsules (each makes enough multi-purpose cleaner, disinfectant & deodorizer to last 2 weeks). Just add your own water right from the tap. I started using [Force of Nature](https://www.forceofnatureclean.com/ref/umbel/) recently and I love it! Tips For Non-Toxic Back To School Lunch Luckily there are a lot of safe food storage products on the market today. Here are some tips to help with back-to-school lunch packing and beyond: - Pack food in reusable lightweight stainless steel containers. I don't recommend glass because I've broken a glass baby bottle in a library bathroom in the past, and I can't imagine this scenario happening at school. - Pack a metal spoon and fork from home. - If you want to go the baggie route, use [If You Care](https://amzn.to/2D1BOu8)waxed baggies. sheet](https://www.ewg.org/research/ewgs-back-school-guide)has suggestions for where to start with toxin-free back-to-school products. - This [PVC-Free guide to school supplies from Greenschools](http://www.greenschools.net/downloads/PVCFree-CHEJ8:09.pdf)is a great reference.
