News You Need > vaccine-update By President A. Gabriel Esteban / July 26, 2021 / Posted in: HEY STUDENTS! NEWS YOU NEED / Twitter / Facebook In the spirit of Take Care, DePaul, the university will require all employees to be vaccinated for COVID-19 by Friday, Sept. 3 in preparation for the return to campus this fall. College of Law employees will be required to have at least one vaccine dose by Aug. 23, the first day of classes for the College of Law autumn term. DePaul's Faculty Council, Staff Council and Student Government Association endorsed this requirement for our entire community, including faculty and staff. You may remember that earlier this year, DePaul announced that students are required to be vaccinated for COVID-19 prior to the start of the 2021-2022 academic year. This includes undergraduate, graduate and professional students in all degree programs starting in the fall 2021 term. Students who submit their vaccine records through Campus Connect by 11:59 p.m. on Aug. 19 will be entered into the Blue Demon Vaccine Contest for a chance to win one of the following prizes:\u00b7 Apple AirPods Pro ($250)\u00b7 $500 gift card to Barnes & Noble Bookstore\u00b7 Wintrust Arena suite for the winner and up to five friends to attend a men's or women's basketball game ($1,000)\u00b7 $2,500 grant toward the cost of attendance If you already submitted your documentation, then you're already entered! For more information about the contest, visit Newsline. The health and safety of our community, and the communities in which our students, faculty and staff live, have driven DePaul's decision-making throughout the pandemic. We know that the COVID-19 vaccines have been proven effective at greatly reducing the spread of the virus, as well as preventing serious illness and death from COVID-19. When used in combination with other COVID-19 prevention measures, vaccines provide protection against the virus. Additional on-campus safety measures and remindersThose with approved medical or religious exemptions will be required to complete COVID-19 testing twice a week. To ensure they comply with this requirement, the university will ask for proof of test results on a random basis. Furthermore, as a reminder, in compliance with the city of Chicago's guidance, DePaul requires unvaccinated individuals to wear a mask over their nose and mouth at all times in DePaul buildings.
