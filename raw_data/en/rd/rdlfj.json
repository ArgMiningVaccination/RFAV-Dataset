Read on to discover all the interesting facts about the cacao ceremony and 7 incredible spiritual benefits of cacao. The History of Cacao Cacao takes root from South and Central America where the ancient Mayan civilization occupied the Western land of the Andes Mountains. The aroma and magical benefits of the cacao trees captured the attention of the Mayan tribe. The ancient Mayans of Belize treated cacao as the \"Food of the God\" under the name \"Theobroma cacao\". \"Theo\" stands for \"food\" and \"Broma\" stands for \"God\". Thanks to the wide availability and the brilliant benefits that cacao impacts on the human soul and body, the ancient native American dwellers started consuming its fresh fleshy fruits. They turned it into a drink in their spiritual and medicinal ceremonies to awaken one's inner self and creativity. The Spanish discovered the magical benefits and incredible taste of the native cacao crop during their colonials in this part of America. From then, they started innovating the use of cacao by adding sugar and spices to balance its genuine bitterness. And chocolate has been created ever since! Nowadays, the use of cacao is spread across the planet. It's available with plenty of chocolate-based delicacies such as milk, bars, chips and many more. Cacao vs. Cocoa: What's the Difference? When it comes to cacao ceremonies, cacao and cocoa are often mistaken. Both cacao and cocoa come from the same source: the cacao fruit that produces pods filled with beans. The differences between cacao and cocoa lie in the processing. Cacao beans are first collected and processed into powder or other forms such as nibs, chips and chocolate bars. Beans are roasted at different temperature levels. If the beans are processed and heated at a higher level, the powder made out of it will be called cocoa. Cocoa powder has less content of fiber and nutrients compared to cacao powder, which is processed under lower temperatures. Cacao is a pure form whose nutrients are still maintained during the processing procedure. That is the reason why cacao is chosen to be the ingredients for cacao drink in ceremonies. Despite the heating, cocoa is still a great choice with a good amount of antioxidants and healthy for your heart, skin and blood pressure.
