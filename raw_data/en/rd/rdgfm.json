The COVID-19 mainly causes respiratory disorders with high infection and severe morbidity and mortality. The symptoms of COVID-19 include sore throat, myalgia, fever, cough, anosmia, and diarrhea [ [1](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_001)]. The symptoms are incidence moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, and eventually death [ [2](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_002)]. There are numerous vaccine platforms (i.e., mRNA, DNA, nonreplicating viral vectors, etc.) for administrating this global pandemic disease around the world [ [3](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_003)]. The FDA approved two vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infection in December 2020. There are four major vaccine mechanisms for the COVID19 vaccines production, including proteinbased vaccines, mRNAbased vaccines, DNAbased vaccines, and inactivated virus that motivates the immune response [ [2](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_002)], [ [3](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_003)], [ [4](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_004)]. At first, two patients incidence transverse myelitis after Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccination. Therefore, concerns about neurological complications from COVID19 vaccines increased [ [5](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_005)]. One patient had preexisting multiple sclerosis; thus, it may not be related to the vaccination, whereas the other patient was determined to be probably associated with the vaccination [ [6](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_006)]. The Clinical trials from the mRNA vaccine demonstrated that seven cases (of 37,000 vaccine recipients) had Bell's palsy, and any case had not incident Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) [ [7](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_007)]. One patient had the GBS in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine trial [ [8](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_008)]. Likewise, no relationship between GBS and COVID19 infection has been found [ [9](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_009)]. The most prevalent neurological signs included headache, dizziness, pain, myalgia, muscle spasms, and paresthesia, which are anticipated to transpire as acute, transient special effects after vaccination. Infrequent cases of dysphonia, diplopia, tremor, seizures, tinnitus, and repetition of herpes zoster have been reported [ [10](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_010)]. However, some neurological patients also received the vaccination, thus neurological signs occur inside the postvaccination window accidentaly. To reports, there has not been an alert indicating more increased rates of neurological disorder related to the COVID19 vaccines. The patients who receive immunosuppressive drugs should have special attentions around COVID19 vaccines, despite there is no absolute neurological disorder about COVID19 vaccination [ [11](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_011)]. These patients potency be at developed risk for severe COVID19, doing vaccination principally vital. However, immunosuppressive drugs may decrease immune responses to vaccination [ [11](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_011)]. Consequently, timing of the vaccine performance plays an essential role in matching immune response [ [12](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_012), [13](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_013)]. Numerous neurological complications are associated with COVID-19 infection [ [2](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_002), [3](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_003)]. Neurologists have concerns about potential neurological side effects, profits, and timing of COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, this study aimed to review systematically research for the COVID-19 vaccine and neurological complications to achieve a comprehensive view and management of neurological diseases in COVID-19 periods. 2 Methods Online databases such as Scopus, ISI Web of Knowledge, Medline, PubMed, Wiley, Embase, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and Clinical Trials, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were searched. Keywords and terms were included Covid-19 vaccine, neuron, complication, neurological, side effect, virus, central neurological system, aches, paresthesia, erythema migrans lesion, fatigue, myalgia, pain, vector-based vaccines, urinary difficulty, ambulating, arm soreness, mild fatigue, chills, facial droop, headaches, epileptic seizure, hemianopia, aphasia, acute syndrome, and encephalitis. Exclusion criteria were included non-neurological disease, lack of the type of Covid-19 vaccine data, only brief studies, clinical studies without preliminary results. Two review authors individually searched and assessed the abstracts and titles of all articles; the third reviewer determined difference between them. Data were documented regarding study location, study design, type of complications, number of patients, various types of COVID-19 vaccine, and type of neurological complications ( [Figure 1](#j_znc-2022-0092_fig_001)). 3 Results Six studies in COVID-19 vaccine and neurological complications include two studies about neurological manifestations after the mRNA vaccines; four records about side effects of vector-based vaccine were included in the study. The main neurological complication associated mRNA vaccines were body aches, paresthesia, and difficulty walking, erythema migrans lesion, fatigue, myalgia, and pain in the left lateral deltoid region. The major neurological complication related to vector-based vaccines were urinary retention difficulty, feeding and ambulating, arm soreness, mild fatigue, chills, left-sided facial droop, headaches, a generalized epileptic seizure, hemianopia, and aphasia, acute somnolence and right-hand hemiparesis, acute transverse myelitis, deep vein thrombosis in her left leg, a vigilance disorder and a twitching, a severe immobilizing opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome, and encephalitis. Three RNA vaccines (Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca) have been proven since December 2020 [ [14](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_014)]. The Pfizer and BioNTech are mRNA vaccines, whereas the AstraZeneca vaccine is a non-replicating viral vector-based vaccine by a live adenovirus carrier. There are a few cases that showed neurological manifestations with COVID-19 vaccinations. The neurological manifestations including transverse myelitis and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis after the AstraZeneca vaccine [ [15](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_015)], seven cases of Bell's palsy, and a single Guillain-Barre syndrome case after mRNA vaccinations [ [16](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_016)]. Other complications include temporary and unspecific sign effects, headache, dizziness, muscle pain, and paresthesia [ [17](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_017)]. The complications include venous thrombosis and cerebral are reported after Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccination [ [18](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_018)]. Gustavo C. Rom\u00e1n et al. reported acute transverse myelitis (ATM) as a severe complication after a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222)) in the three cases [ [19](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_019)]. Zuhorn et al. demonstrated neurological side effects after the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccinate in the three cases report. They reported post-vaccine encephalitis with deep vein thrombosis in the left leg, a vigilance disorder and a twitching, and a severe immobilizing opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome after vaccination. Zuhorn et al. showed a temporal association between ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccination and the presentation of encephalitis [ [20](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_020)]. Waheed et al. reported an 82-year-old female with neurological side effects such as Guillain-Barre syndrome after Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She had body aches, paresthesia, and difficulty walking. The malaise and body aches revealed in the first week after vaccination. In the second week, she had worse side effects such as increased difficulty in walking. Also, the other complications have been seen such as weak pinprick in bilateral lower extremities up to the knees, and areflexia in both upper and lower extremities with the diagnosis of GBS [ [16](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_016)]. Wolf et al. evaluated neurological complications after AstraZeneca vaccines in three individuals. They reported the neurological complications such as thrombocytopenia and intracranial venous sinus thrombosis, headaches, generalized mild aphasia, acute somnolence, and right-hand hemiparesis. They reported elevated levels of D-dimers, platelet factor 4 antiplatelet antibodies, corona spike protein antibodies, combined with thrombocytopenia in the individuals [ [21](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_021)]. Prasad et al. reported a rare bifacial diplegia variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome case after Janssen COVID-19 Vaccination. Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is an immune-mediated demyelinating disturbance that attacks the peripheral nervous system. They reported a 41-year-old man with an acute start of urinary retention 12 days following his COVID-19 vaccination. The patient reported arm soreness, mild fatigue, and chills following three days. On the 15th day, the left-sided facial falls down was revealed, and Bell's palsy was diagnosed. On 21st day, he was involved with weakness, paresthesias in all extremities, difficulty feeding, ambulating because of his weakness, and a new start of right facial weakness [ [22](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_022)]. Sophie C, et al. (2022) introduced two cases with Parsonage-Turner syndrome after COVID-19 vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccines. Neurological side effects after Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were severe, electric, shooting pain in his left the erythema migrans lesion, fatigue, myalgias, sudden-start, intense, and cramping pain in the left lateral deltoid region were revealed after Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccine. After a 3-month follow-up, the patient presented no residual pain but increased weakness. The motion and strength were good but did not return to the first levels [ [24](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_024)] ( [Table 1](#j_znc-2022-0092_tab_001)). 4 Discussion The neurological manifestations after Covid-19 vaccines were systematically reviewed in the study. There is also no description of vaccine-related reactivation in different times and durations. In the study by Brosh-Nissimov et al. [ [23](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_023)], \"1 week\" was used to assess the vaccine-relevant virus reactivation or contained patients with skin reactions within 21 days after any dose of vaccine [ [23](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_023)]. In examinations for BNT162b2 and mRNA1273, Bell was palsy created in four and three vaccinated persons in compared with zero and one person, respectively, in the placebo groups [ [25](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_025), [26](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_026)]. A middle increase (29%) in peripheral neuropathies was also seen in the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine cohort evaluated with placebo. In all instances, the document was inadequate to link the vaccines to these incidences. Therefore, agencies in the United States and Europe have corrected the tags of Johnson & Johnson's Ad26. COV2.S and AstraZeneca's Vaxzevria vaccines, which are both viral-vectored vaccines, mirror a growth risk of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome after vaccination. Therefore, supervision is needed for scarce bad events that may have not been seen or observed only sparsely during clinical examinations [ [27](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_027)]. Generally, the neurological complications after COVID-19 vaccinations are moderate and temporary, such as fever/chills, headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, or skin manifestations such as swelling, redness, and pain. These moderate neurological signs are usual after all types of COVID-19 vaccines. Anguish-related incidences, such as impressions of syncope and/or dizziness, are typical. Other side effects included: vasculitis, anaphylaxis, seizures, [ [27](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_027), [28](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_028)]. Therefore, vaccinated patients with headaches should be doubtful of cerebral venous thrombosis. Cerebral venous thrombosis is one of the severe unfavorable COVID-19 vaccine-related neurological complications [ [29](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_030)- [36](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_029)] especially, after viral vector-based vaccines such as the Johnson and Johnson, and AstraZeneca vaccines [ [37](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_037)]. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a sharp inflammatory demyelinating disturbance of the central neurotic system. It extends in many cases after vaccination with magnetic resonance imaging creating multiple, separate T2/FLAIR hyperintense damages in the brain. Although, the ADEM revealed after infectious in most cases [ [37](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_037)]. Bell's palsy frequently occurred with mRNA vaccines [ [38](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_038)]. The acute transverse myelitis (ATM) is a local inflammatory neurotic spinal cord disturbance. The signs of ATM include rapid onset motor weakness, sensory alterations, and autonomic dysfunction. Etiology may be infectious, para-infectious, systemic autoimmune, or ischemic diseases. It can be caused by many diseases and factors such as infectious agents, systemic autoimmune, or ischemic [ [39](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_039), [40](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_040)]. ATM may be occurred following booster dose ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination and was determined as idiopathic, short segment, spinal cord demyelination may be due to vaccination or following first dose vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [ [6](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_006), [41](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_041)]. Recent research on the immune-pathogenesis of ATM has shown the effects of interleukins IL-6 and IL-17. The IL-6 is assessed in the CSF and forecast inability in the myelitis. Both IL-6 and IL- 17 are increased by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in ATM [ [42](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_042)]. IL-17 formulates cytokines generated by astrocytes. Adjuvants (as helping factors to the immune and inflammatory responses to vaccines) have also been mentioned as one of the agents due to neurological complications [ [43](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_043)]. ON the other hand, COVID-19 vaccines such as Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (AZD1222, ChAdOx1, and Vaxzevria) are viral carrier vaccines to prevent COVID-19) [ [44](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_044)]. Rom\u00e1n et al. confirmed the neurological manifestations after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination [ [19](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_019)]. Herpes Zoster (HZ) is a neurological manifestation following COVID 19 vaccines such as BNT162b2, mRNA-1273 (Pfizer BioNTech BNT162b and AZD1222 [ [45](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_045)]. The HZ can be one of the causes of facial nerve palsy following vaccination [ [46](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_046)]. The trigeminal ganglion is the location of VZV (varicella-zoster virus). In Ramsay-Hunt syndrome, facial nerve palsy is created by infection of the reactivated VZV of the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve [ [47](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_047)]. Any dermatome of cranial nerve V and spinal nerves can be affected by HZ following COVID-19 vaccination [ [48](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_048)]. Other nervous signs after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinations are three encephalitis. This encephalitis is associated with a memory disorder, disorder mental status, exclusion of alternative, and CSF pleocytosis (a case of seizures without prior epilepsy) [ [49](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_049)]. Usually, vaccinations can create a strong statement of inflammatory cytokines and a T-cell reaction. This issue was shown in the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine [ [50](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_050)]. After vaccination, antigens are detected as potential pathogens, like pattern-recognition receptors on local or peripheral circulating immune cells (monocytes and macrophages) and stromal cells [ [51](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_051)]. Mediators and products of inflammation in the circulation can affect other body organs and create systemic adverse, and create neurotic manifestation in some cases after microglia activation, depending on the immunogenic background and the innate immune memory [ [52](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_052), [53](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_053)]. These immune agents may conduct to the so-called \"cytokine storm\" syndrome that causes coagulopathy and thrombosis. Also, of critical value during COVID-19 are the before- and after-infectious inflammatory or immune-mediated neurological disturbances [ [54](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_054), [55](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_055)], also observed after vaccination, that affect both the CNS and the PNS causing GBS, ADEM, NMOSD, and ATM, among others [ [56](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_056), [57](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_057)]. In many genes occur induction and copy, causing in combination and scape of pyrogenic cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-], and prostaglandin-E2) into the circulation that mimics the response to natural infection. After stimulation of the immune system, a complex series of innate immune events occur including, phagocytosis, release of inflammatory mediators including chemokines and cytokines, activation of complement, and cellular recruitment. The vaccine's efficacy of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is about 66.1% against symptomatic moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and about 85.4% against hospitalization or death [ [58](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_058)]. Common complications after vaccination include injection site reactions, fever, chills, and malaise, but there are rare reports of venous thrombosis [ [59](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_059)]. GBS, Bell's palsy, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and stroke were reported after Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Side effects reactions can occur with the administration of any vaccine. Several neurological manifestations such as transverse myelitis after the COVID-19 vaccination have been reported [ [60](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_060)], [ [61](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_061)], [ [62](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_062)], [ [63](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_063)], [ [64](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_064)], [ [65](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_065)], [ [66](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_066)]. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, constructed as messenger RNA vaccines, may trigger an autoimmune response, leading to the construction of antibodies against the myelin sheath [ [16](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_016)]. Prasad et al. reported Guillain-Barre Syndrome after Janssen COVID-19 Vaccination and confirmed manifestation's neurological after Janssen COVID-19 Vaccination [ [22](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_022)]. |No||Authors||Title||Year||No. [24](#j_znc-2022-0092_ref_024)] 5 Conclusions After accepting COVID-19 vaccinates, a large spectrum of severe neurological unfavorable has been reported. One of the neurological complications is Bell's palsy which was reported after the mRNA vaccine. Additional severe unexpected complications include transverse myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. These complications could occur as a result of molecular stimulation and later neuronal damage. Neurologists should be aware of the complications of COVID-19 vaccines and keep in mind their effects on CNS diseases. This knowledge helps physicians and neurologists to better diagnose and identification of vaccine-related adverse events, thereby facilitating improved management and treatment of these complications. Generally, the advantages of COVID19 vaccination are dominant on the risks of a neurological complication at both individual and population levels. Future investigations will be required to find any relationship between neurological complications and COVID19 vaccines principally as new strains of the virus and new vaccines are technologically advanced against them. - Author contributions: All the authors have accepted responsibility for the entire content of this submitted manuscript and approved submission. - Research funding: None declared. - Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare no conflicts of interest regarding this article.
