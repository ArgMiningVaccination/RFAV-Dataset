The naturopathic philosophy is to stimulate the healing power of the body and treat the underlying cause of disease; it is the art and science of supporting the natural healing processes of the patient through the removal of any obstacles to health. It is the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of physical, mental and emotional conditions; and it is the promotion of well-being using therapeutics that support or enhance a patient's overall health. In BC, naturopathic physicians (NDs) are licensed to provide primary care. They are trained as general practitioners in complementary medicine, providing a full range of diagnostic tests and therapies.

Naturopathic medicine is for people of all ages and health histories who want to take their health into their own hands. NDs are primary health providers and are qualified to see and treat everyone, though some NDs focus in specific areas such as pediatrics, geriatrics, cancer care, sports medicine, digestive health, pain management, etc. What kind of training do NDs have? Naturopathic doctors (NDs) in BC receive a minimum of three years pre-medical training at university then complete four years post-graduate training at an accredited naturopathic medical school. NDs complete roughly 1500 hours of basic clinical sciences, 1900 hours of standard medical therapeutics (e.g., pharmacology, family medicine, internal medicine etc.) and extensive training in naturopathic treatments as described above. Doctors complete provincial board exams prior to receiving licensure. Dr. Rayburn completed Bachelor of Science degree from Thompson Rivers University, followed in 2011 by her Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine from the Canadian college of Naturopathic Medicine in Toronto. Dr. Rayburn has further certifications in prescribing authority as well as intravenous therapies. What will my treatments be like? NDs conduct a comprehensive intake focusing on a patient's health history as well as their current medical issues. This history may involve a physical exam and the use of standard diagnostic instruments and laboratory tests. Naturopathic protocols are developed using not only standard lab tests but also lifestyle evaluation including dietary habits, emotional stress, exercise and exposure to environmental hazards. Every patient receives an individualized treatment plan catered specifically to his or her needs. No two people are exactly alike, and so no two treatments are exactly the same. Your treatments will depend on your specific current health concerns, your general health history, as well as your health goals. Are naturopathic Doctors licensed as Doctors? Yes. Naturopathic physicians have been registered in BC under health legislation since 1923, becoming a self-regulating health profession in 1936. While interest in safe, effective, non-drug therapies waned with the postwar fascination of medical technology, there has been a shift back towards naturopathic care. In fact, in North America today, more patients visit non-MDs for healthcare than MDs. Naturopathic medicine is one of the fastest growing health disciplines in Canada. In BC, the number of licensed NDs doubled between 2000 and 2010. What are Infusion & IV Therapies? IV Therapy involves the injection of high dose nutrients into a vein. This ensures 100% absorption of nutrients into the body. IV Therapy is an excellent way to delivery nutrients to the body while bypassing the liver and digestive system. This high level of nutrients can aid in improving recovery rates and decreasing fatigue. There are many intravenous protocols used to target specific health concerns with each treatment being individualized for each patient and condition. Dr. Andrea Rayburn ND will happily customize formulations for your individual needs. All IV therapies require a naturopathic evaluation and safety screen. Is naturopathic medicine covered by insurance? Most extended health care plans cover naturopathic doctors, usually between $200-500 per year. Some plans also include lab or diagnostic testing coverage. You can clarify coverage with your benefits manager. For individuals with a Health Spending Account, visits to an ND are 100% covered. In respect to the provincial MSP plan, there is limited coverage for individuals on Premium Assistance or social assistance only. "}
