Compared to FLUAD, FLUAD QUADRIVALENT includes an additional B strain to help prevent disease caused by all 4 influenza strains represented in the vaccine.2 For the non-influenza comparator vaccine, the proportion of subjects with HI titers greater than or equal to 1:40 at Day 21 were 46.7% for the A/H1N1 strain, for B/Victoria. seroconversion the for randomized, observer-blind, non-influenza comparator-controlled, multicenter efficacy study. Adult subjects 65 years of age and older received 1 dose of either FLUAD QUADRIVALENT (N=3379) or a US-licensed non-influenza criterion: lower bound of the 95% CI for the % of subjects with HI titer 1:40 must be 60%bSeroconversion is defined as titer <1:10 and postvaccination HI titer 1:40 or at least 4-fold increase in HI from prevaccination HI titer 1:10. Success criterion: lower bound of the 95% CI for the seroconversion rate must be 30%.cNon-influenza comparator vaccine=combined tetanus toxoid, toxoid, and (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals) The FLUAD QUADRIVALENT was evaluated in 2 multicenter, randomized controlled trials in 4269 adults 65 years and older.1 In Study 1, most common (10%) local and systemic adverse reactions were observed within 7 days of vaccination with FLUAD QUADRIVALENT or a non-influenza comparator vaccine.1 N=number of subjects with solicited safety data aSolicited safety population: all subjects in the exposed population who received a study vaccine and provided postvaccination solicited safety data. bSevere reactions of each type were reported in 1.1% or fewer subjects receiving FLUAD QUADRIVALENT; severe reactions of each type were also reported in the comparator group at similar percentages. Severe definitions: erythema, induration, and ecchymosis=>100 mm headache, activity; loss of appetite=not eating at all; vomiting=6 or more times in 24 hours or requires intravenous hydration; diarrhea=6 or more loose stools in 24 hours or requires intravenous hydration; fever=102.2 \u00b0F (39 \u00b0C) In Study 2, FLUAD QUADRIVALENT demonstrated a similar safety profile to that of FLUAD.1 Solicited local and systemic adverse reactions reported were similar to those reported for Study 1. For intramuscular injection only.1 FLUAD QUADRIVALENT is supplied as syringes.1 Administer FLUAD QUADRIVALENT as a single 0.5-mL intramuscular injection in adults 65 years of age and older.1 Each 0.5-mL dose of FLUAD QUADRIVALENT does not contain a preservative. The syringe, plunger, and tip cap are not made with natural rubber latex.1 Store FLUAD QUADRIVALENT at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F). Protect from light. Do not freeze. Discard if the vaccine has been frozen. Do not use after expiration date.1 Choosing a vaccine based on clinical trial data alone may not give you a complete picture. Because influenza varies each year, look to both clinical trial and real-world evidence (RWE) data when choosing an influenza vaccine.20,21 RWE studies for FLUAD are relevant to FLUAD QUADRIVALENT because both products are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.1 The outcomes reported here contain information not included in the Prescribing Information. your eligible patients 65+ years2 [Order Now](/start-order) Access Featured Resources Influenza can have a devastating impact on adults 65 years and older1 [Learn more about the burden of influenza among this age group](/influenza-65plus) Explore Other Flu Vaccines in the CSL Seqirus Portfolio Please see Important Safety Information and full US Prescribing Information on each vaccine's respective product page. INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION CONTRAINDICATIONS Do not administer FLUAD QUADRIVALENT or AFLURIA QUADRIVALENT to anyone with a history of severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine, including egg protein, or to a previous influenza vaccine. Do not administer FLUCELVAX QUADRIVALENT to anyone with a history of severe allergic reactions (e.g. anaphylaxis) to any component of the vaccine. WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS If Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) has occurred within 6 weeks of receipt of prior influenza vaccine, the decision to give FLUAD QUADRIVALENT, FLUCELVAX QUADRIVALENT, or AFLURIA QUADRIVALENT should be based on careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision must be available to manage possible anaphylactic reactions following administration of the vaccine. Syncope (fainting) may occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines. Syncope can be accompanied by transient neurological signs such as visual disturbance, paresthesia, and tonic-clonic limb movements. Ensure procedures are in place to avoid falling injury and to restore cerebral perfusion following syncope by maintaining a supine or Trendelenburg position. QUADRIVALENT, AFLURIA QUADRIVALENT in immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy, may be lower than in immunocompetent individuals. Vaccination with FLUAD QUADRIVALENT, FLUCELVAX QUADRIVALENT, or AFLURIA QUADRIVALENT may not protect all vaccine recipients against influenza disease.
