The purpose of this project was to investigate the relevance of ATT after the introduction of GMP- and GLP-principles in the manufacturing of biological products.

The retrospective analysis of ATT results reveals reasons for the incompatibility of particular preparation groups, vaccine components or additives with the animal species used. There were highly significant differences between the manufacturers and the PEI regarding the frequency of deviating test results for identical test batches. Positive ATTs never resulted from the insufficient quality of a batch. On the other hand vaccines causing adverse reactions in the target species were not identified by the ATT.

Taking into account aspects of drug safety and animal welfare it is recommended to the DAB to omit the ATT.
