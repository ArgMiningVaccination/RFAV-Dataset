[HHS: 45 CFR 46.402(c)] Phase 1, 2, 3, 4 Drug Trials Different stages of testing drugs in humans, from first application in humans (Phase 1) through limited and broad clinical tests (Phase 3), to postmarketing studies (Phase 4). Phase 1 Drug Trial Phase 1 trials include the initial introduction of an investi gational new drug into humans. These studies are typically conducted with healthy volunteers; sometimes, where the drug is intended for use in patients with a particular disease, however, such patients may participate as research partic ipants . Phase 1 trials are designed to determine the metabolic and pharmacological actions of the drug in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses (to establish a safe dose range), and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness; they are typically closely monitored. The ultimate goal of Phase 1 trials is to obtain sufficient information about the drug' s pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects to permit the design of well - controlled, sufficiently valid Phase 2 studies. Other examples of Phase 1 studies include studies of drug metabolism, structure- activity relationships, and mechanisms of actions in humans, as well as studies in which investigational drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease processes. The total number of research partic ipants involved in Phase 1 investigations is generally in the range of 20- 80. Phase 2 Drug Trial Phase 2 trials include controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the drug 's effectiveness for a particular indication in patie nts with the disease or condition under study, and to determine the common short -term side effects and risks associated with the drug. These studies are typically well -controlled, closely monitored, and conducted with a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred research participants . Phase 3 Drug Trial Phase 3 trials involve the administration of a new drug to a larger number of patients in different clinical settings to determine its safety, efficacy, and appropriate dosage. They are performed after preliminary evidence of effectiveness has been obtained and are intended to gather necessary additional information about effectiveness and safety for evaluating the overall benefit -risk relationship of the drug, and to provide HRP -001 / Version 1.00 / Effective 03 -28-2023 / Page 25 of 34 an adequate basis for physician labeling. In Phase 3 studies, the drug is used the way it would be administered when marketed. When these studies are completed and the sponsor believes that the drug is safe and effective under specific conditions, the sponsor applies to the FDA for approval to market the drug. Phase 3 trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand patient -subjects. Phase 4 Drug Trial Concurrent with marketing approval; FDA may seek agreement from the sponsor to conduct c ertain post - marketing (Phase 4) studies to delineate additional information about the drug' s risks, benefits, and optimal use. These studies could include, but would not be limited to, studying different doses or schedules of administration than were used in Phase 2 studies, use of the drug in other patient populations or other stages of the disease, or use of the drug over a longer period of time.

An sIRB may also be known as the Lead IRB. Single IRB (sIRB) Study A study in which two or more institutions (participating sites, or pSites) coordinate to complete the research activities, but all institutions rely on a single institution's/organization's IRB for ethical review. The reviewing IRB may or may not be affiliated with any of the pSites. Special Population A category of subjects whose inclusion in research may present ethical problems or whose exclusion from research may pose questions of equitability . The term encompasses the pre-2018 requirements of the Common Rule \"vulnerable population\" and, separately under the 2018 r equirements of the Common Rule, pregnant women, who are not \"vulnerable\" but for whom safeguards must still be considered. Sponsor (of a d rug trial) A person or entity that initiates a clinical investigation of a drug \u2014 usually the drug manufacturer or research institution that developed the drug. The sponsor does not actually conduct the investigation, but rather distributes the new drug to investigators and physicians for clinical trials. The drug is administered to research participants under the immediate direction of an investigator who is not also a sponsor. A clinical investigator may, however, serve as a sponsor -investigator. The sponsor assumes responsibility for investigating the new drug, including responsibility for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The sponsor, for example, is responsible for obtaining FDA approval to conduct a trial and for reporting the results of the trial to the FDA. HRP -001 / Version 1.00 / Effective 03 -28-2023 / Page 31 of 34 Sponsor -Investigator An individual who both initiates and actually conducts, alone or with others, a clinical investigation, i.e., under whose immediate direction the test article is administered or dispensed to, or used involving, a subject . The term does not include any person other than an individual, e.g., corporation or agency. [FDA: 21 CFR 50.3(f)] Statistical Significance A determination of the probability of obtaining the particular distribution of the data on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. Or, more simply put, the probability of coming to a false positive conclusion. [See McLarty (1987), p. 2.] If the probability is less than or equal to a predetermined value (e.g., 0.05 or 0.01), then the null hypothesis is rejected at that significance level (0.05 or 0.01). Status Report An administrative check -in that occurs annually for studies that do not require Continuing Rev iew under the 2018 Requirements of the Common Rule. There are three requirements for utilizing the status report process: 1. The research is not FDA-regulated; and 2. The research study was initially approved by the IRB on or after January 21, 2019; and 3. The research is eligible for expedited review, either because it was determined to be no more than minimal risk by the IRB or because the research study status is currently \"closed to accrual, in long-term follow -up on ly\" or \"closed to accrual, in data analysis only.\" Subcommittee for IRB Activity Review A sub committee typically involves two or more IRB Members and includes the original primary reviewers of an activity. Subinvestigator Any individual member of the clinical trial team designated and supervised by the investigator at a trial site to perform critical trial -related procedures and/or to make important trial -related decisions (e.g., associates, residents, research fellows). [ICH E6 (R1)1.56] See also: Investigator . Suspected Adverse Reaction Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. The term \"reasonable possibility\" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. [FDA: 21 CFR 312.32(a) ] Suspension of IRB Approval An action of the IRB, IRB designee, Institutional Official/Organizational Official, or designee of the Institutional Official/Organizational Official to temporarily or permanently withdraw IRB approval of some or all research procedures short of a Termination of IRB Approval. Suspended studies remain open and are subject to continuing review. Systematic Having or involving a system, method, or plan. Systematic Investigation An activity that involves a prospective plan that incorporates data collection, either quantitative or qualitative, and data analysis to answer a question. HRP -001 / Version 1.00 / Effective 03 -28-2023 / Page 32 of 34 T Termination of IRB Approval An action of the IRB, IRB designee, Institutional Official/Organizational Official, or designee of the Institutional Official/Organizational Official to p ermanently withdraw IRB approval of all research procedures. Terminated studies are permanently closed and no longer require continuing review. Test Article Any drug for human use, biological product for human use, medical device for human use, human food additive, color additive, electronic product, or any other article subject to regulation under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act or under Sections 351 and 354- 360F of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262 and 263b - 263n). Third Party Safety Reports A report prepared by an external sponsor or coordinating center overseeing a multi -site study describing one or more adverse events or other unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others which have occurred at one or more of the participating sites involved in the study. Third Party Subjects An informal name for living individuals about whom researchers obtain individually identifiable private information from someone else but who themselves have no interaction with the researcher. Third- party subjects are generally considered to be human subjects. Translation Conversion of a written document from one language to another. U Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect Any serious adverse effect on health or safety, any life -threat ening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application ), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of research participants. [FDA: 21 CFR 812.3(s)] Unexpected A dverse Event Any adverse event occurring in one or more subjects in a research protocol, the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent with either: (1) the known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures involved in the research that are described in (a) the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed consent document, and (b) other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts; or (2) the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject(s) experiencing the adverse event and the subject's predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse event. [OHRP Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks & Adverse Events Guidance ( 2007)] Unexpected Adverse Event or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered \"unexpected\" if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or HRP -001 / Version 1.00 / Effective 03 -28-2023 / Page 33 of 34 elsewhere in the current application, as amended. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. \"Unexpected,\" as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. [FDA: 21 CFR 312.32(a)] Unanticipated Problems that Involve Risk to Research Participants or Others Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 1. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; 2. related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research); and 3. suggests that the research places research participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. [OHRP Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks & Adverse Events Guidance (2007)] Unexpected Suspected Adverse Event Any unexpected adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. Unrestricted -Access Data are accessible to anyone via public website (previously referred to as \"open access\"). See also: Controlled- Access . V Vaccine A biologic product generally made from an infectious agent or its components \u2014 a virus, bacterium, or other microorganism \u2014 that is killed (inactive) or live- attenuated (active, although weakened).
