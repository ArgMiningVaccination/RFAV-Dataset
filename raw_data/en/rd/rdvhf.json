Life stood still all over the world and the want to improve one's immunity became very important overnight. The virus has really shown us our vulnerability to unknown pathogens. The basic concept of Ayurveda is to prevent diseases that you acquire by increasing your immunity with proper lifestyle choices. Many people research how to strengthen your immunity with Ayurveda. Let us understand what Immunity is according to Ayurveda first. Let us consider our immune system and its reaction to being a fascinating skit that will continue to unfold for as long as we live. It should, without a doubt, contain certain important characters, without whom the drama would never be able to emerge. White blood cells (WBC), also known as leukocytes, are the major components or characteristics that help our bodies create and maintain a healthy immune system. They flow through the blood arteries and lymphatic vessels at all times, ensuring that our bodies are always ready to combat any alien body. The notion of hereditary reserve and acquired reserve underpins the Ayurvedic understanding of immunity. It is properly termed as 'Vyadhi-Kshmatva' or 'self-avoidance of sickness' in the Ayurvedic Classics. Vyadhi-Kshmatva made of words: 'to fight.' Ayurveda identifies three forms of immunity: Sleep deprivation You are more prone to contract viruses or germs if you do not get enough sleep. You may also take longer to improve. This is due to your body's inability to produce as many infection-fighting cells and proteins known as antibodies, which aid in disease defence. Only during sleep does your body produce cytokines, which are proteins that aid the immune system. Anxiety Stress and worry aren't particularly effective germ fighters. In as little as 30 minutes, having worrisome thoughts will decrease your immune response. Constant stress does more damage than we think and makes it strenuous to fight off diseases such as shingles, flu, herpes, and others. Consult your doctor if you can't get rid of your anxiety or if it's interfering with your daily life. Vitamin D deficiency You may be aware that you require it for strong bones and healthy blood cells. However, vitamin D also helps to strengthen your immune system. It can be found in eggs, fatty fish, and fortified foods such as milk and cereal. Another important source is sunlight. In the summer, 5-15 minutes of sun exposure on your hands, face, and arms 2-3 times a week is usually sufficient. During cold seasons, you may require a little extra than usual. Diet lacking fruits and vegetables These meals may help your body produce more white blood cells, which are required to fight infections. Fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as nuts and seeds, are high in zinc, beta-carotene, vitamins A, C, and E, and other minerals essential for good health. Plant-based diets are also high in fibre, which helps decrease your body fat percentage and boosts your immune system. The preventative actions indicated in Ayurveda against illnesses indirectly result in an increase in the individual's immunity. So, let us take a closer look at what Ayurveda says about increasing immunity to help prevent illnesses and remain healthy. A healthy immune system is a delicate but sophisticated balancing act. Maintaining dosha balance and increasing immunity with Ayurveda supports an adequately functioning immune system, which aids in illness prevention. Love your body in every manner imaginable and witness how it responds by preserving immunity.
