Regional incidence is decreasing *: Since week 14, Fraser Health incidence decrease d (218 to 30 per 100K) . Since week 13, Vancouver Coastal i ncidence decreased ( 192 to 17 per 100K). Since week 1 4, Interior Health in cidence decreased (86 to 25 per 100K ). Since week 1 3, Island Healt h incidence decreased ( 48 to 3 per 100K). Since week 1 3, Northern Health incidence decreased (119 to 14 per 100K). Age-specific incidences decre ased from weeks 13 -14 to week 22 for all age groups. Sharpest declines were seen in the 15 -19-year -olds, 20 -29-year -olds and 30 -39-year - olds. -dose vaccine coverage for 12+ year -olds exceeded 70% by week 22. Highest coverage was in 70+ year -olds at almost 90%, met by 34 cases in week 22 , comparable to case counts in Wave 1 for that age group. Testing of MSP -funded specimens decreased by 58 % from ~67,5 00 specimens in week 14 to ~28,000 in week 22 . Positivity of MSP -funded specimens decreased from 12. 1% in week 14 to 5.0% in week 22. The number of weekly hospital admissions peaked in week 15 and has declined since then, reaching 92 admissions in week 2 2. The number of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions also peaked in week 15 and has decreased since then, reaching 22 admissions i n week 22 . The number of deaths ha s been stable from weeks 7 to 22 , with 18 deaths in week 22 . By case of earliest onset date, there were no outbreaks repo rted in care settings in week 22 . BCCDC COVID -19 Situational Report Week 22 Page 2 of 10 BELOW ARE IMPORTANT NOTES relevant to the interpretation of data displayed in this bulletin: Episode date s are defined by dates of illness onset. When those dates are unavailable, earliest laboratory date is used (collection or result date); if also unavailable, then public health care report date is used . Analyses based on episode date (or illness onset date) may better represent the timing of epidemic evolution. Episode -based tallies for recent weeks are expected to increase as case data, in particular onset dates, are more complete . The weekly tally by surveillance date (result date, if unavailable the n report date) includes cases with illness onset date in preceding weeks. Episode dates for hospital admission, ICU, and death are defined by admission and death dates. When unavailable, surveillance date is used. As of June 15, 2021, p er capita rates/incidences for year 2020 are based on Population Estimates 2020 (n= 5,139,568 for BC overall) and for year 2021 are based on PEOPLE 2020 estimates (n= 5,197,224 for BC overall) . Laboratory data include Medical Service Plan (MSP) funded (e.g. clinical diagnostic tests) and non -MSP funded (e.g. screening tests) specimens. Data sources include: health authority case line list data, laboratory PLOVER data, PHSA Provincial Immunization Registry (PIR), and h ospital data (PHSA Provincial COVID19 Monitoring Solution (PCMS)) . Case data were extracted on June 14, 2021 , laboratory data on June 11, 2021 , PIR vaccine coverage date on June 11, 2021 , and PCM S hospitalization data on June 14 , 2021 . A. COVID -19 case counts and epidemic curve s Provincially, up to week 22 , 2021, there have been 145,768 cases, for a cumulative incidence of 2,801 per 100K ( Table 1 , Figure 1). As shown in Figure 1 , following the peak of Wave 3 in week 14 at 150 per 100K, incidence has decreased by 86% to reach 21 per 100K in week 22. The incidence in week 22 is comparable to early weeks of October 2020 during Phase 3b . Rates may increase as data by episode date becom e more complete. Due to an update to the provincial population estimates used to calculate rates, there is a slight change in rates from previous reports. As shown in Figure 2 , incidence decreased in all he alth authorities in the 8 -9 weeks prior to week 22 . Fraser Health (FH) maintains the highest incidence rate at 30 per 100K, followed by Interior Health (IH) at 25 per 100K; Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) at 17 per 100K; Northern Health (NH) at 14 per 100 K; and Island Healt h (VIHA) at 3 per 100K. Incidence has decreased in all health service delivery areas to week 19; however, East Kootenay and Kootenay Boundary in IHA have both increased slightly since week 20 and 21, respectively . Rates may increase as data become more complete. Table 1.

Test rates and percent positive As shown by the darker -colored bars in Figure 4 , testing of MSP -funded specimens decreased by 58 % from ~ 67,500 specimens in week 14 to ~28,000 in week 22 . Positivity of MSP -funded specimens has been decreasing rapidly since week 14 (12.1%) reaching 5.0% in week 22 . As shown in Panel A of Figure 5 , the per capita testing rates for MSP -only specimens has been declining in all HAs. Testing rates have decreased in VCH, IH, NH and VIHA since week 14 and in FH since week 15. As shown in Panel B , percent positivity for week 22 MSP -funded tests is highest in NH at 5.9% followed by FH at 5.6%, VCH at 5.2%, IH at 5.1 %, and lowest in VIHA at 0.4%. Percent positivity has decreased all HAs: VIHA and VCH since week 13, FH since week 14, NHA and IHA since week 20. Figure 4 .

Age profile - Testing and cases Testing rates and percent positivity by age group As shown in Figure 6 , testing rates in week 22 have decreased in all age groups since week 17. The highest testing rate in week 22 was in the 80 + year -olds at 833 per 100K and the 5 -9 year -olds at 752 per 100K. As shown in Figure 6 , the percent positivity has dec reased in all age groups since weeks 17-18. The percent positivity in the 60-79 and the 0 -4 year age group s ha ve experienced the sharpest decline since week 17. In week 22 , the highest percent positivity was in the 15-19 year -olds at 8.8% followed by the 20-39-year -olds at 6.2% and the 10 -14 and 40 -59-year -olds at 5.7%. The lowest percent positivity was in the 80+ year -olds at 1.5%. Case distribution and weekly incidence by age group As shown in Figure 7 , the percentage contribution of the 10-14 and 15-19 year -olds in creased by 2.0% and 1.3% since week 21, met mainly by a decrease of 1.3 %, 1.1% , and 0.9% among the 20 -29, 70-79, and -49 year -olds, respectively . The remaining age groups' contributions remai ned relatively stable. As shown in Figure 8, age specific incidences decreased from weeks 13 -14 to week 22 for all age groups. Sharpest declines were seen in the 15 -19-year -olds and 20 -29-year -olds from week 14 to week 2 2 (from 219 to 43 per 100k and 256 to 32 per 100k, respectively), and in the 30 -39-year -olds from week 13 to week 2 2 (from 197 to 27 per 100k). Week 2 2 age-specific incidences are likely to increase as data become more complete. Figure 6.

The vaccination of community - based older adults 70+ years of age started between weeks 10 and 14 . As shown in Figure 9 , by week 22, the single -dose vaccination coverage in this age group reached almost 90% and was met with only 34 cases with , comparable to case counts in Wave 1 for that age group. The vaccination of adults 40 to 69 years of age started in week s 15-19; by week 22, coverage exceeded 80%, 75%, and 70% reflecting case counts of 72, 117, and 142 for the 60 -69, 50 -59, and 40 -49 year -olds, respectively . The vaccination of adults 20 to 39 year of age started in weeks 19 -20; by week 22, coverage was less than 70% with ~200 cases for each of the 20 -29 and 30 -39 year -old groups. The lowest coverage was in c hildren 12 -19 years of age at <50% coverage in week 22 . Overall, single -dose coverage for all age groups 12+ exceeded 70% by week 22 . Figure 9.

Severe outcome counts and epi -curve The number of weekly hospital a dmissions peaked in week 15 (384 ) and has declined since then, reaching 92 admissions in week 22 . The number of intensive care unit (ICU) admiss ions also peaked in week 15 (109 ) and has d ecreased since then, reaching 22 admissions in week 22 . The number of deaths has been stable from weeks 7 to 22 with an average of 25 deaths (Table 3 , Figure 10). These numbers may increase in future reports as more data become available . Cumulatively, there have been 14 confirmed cases of Multi -system Inflammatory Syndrome in children and adolescents (M IS- C) in BC from January 1, 2020 to week 22 . The median age of these cases is 9 (range 1 -15) years. Table 3.
