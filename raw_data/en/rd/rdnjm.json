John Wilkes was born in 1930 in Tettenhall near Wolverhampton, three and a half years after his sister Gwyneth, and began his schooling at Tettenhall College, a small public boarding school. A dreamy child in his early years, the decision that he should repeat a year gave him a big shock, and became a decisive moment for his future. From then on he was top of his class and later became a prefect. His focus was in science, but a change came in 1946 when a new specialist art teacher arrived in the school and John became increasingly interested in the arts, with pottery his next passion. This change set him on the road to his eventual profession. The Schreinerei was the first purpose-built structure on the hill at Dornach, Switzerland, built as part of Rudolf Steiner's complex of buildings for the new headquarters of his Anthroposophy movement. The Schreinerei dates from 1913. It is an unprepossessing timber structure clad in weathered vertical boards. Inside, the novelty of the structure is immediately visible. The 'auditorium' of the Schreinerei offers a clear-span working-space (i.e. no internal supporting pillars) with massive timber arches spanning the space and bearing the roof with its skylights. The Schreinerei occupies a prime location in the Goetheanum precinct. Coming out from this shed and onto its forecourt, one sees the Goetheanum immediately ahead. Looking out to the left is Haus Duldeck and beyond that is the valley and the village of Dornach. Looking at the Schreinerei from the Goetheanum, to the right of the 'auditorium' is an accretion of unpretentious conjoined outbuildings including Steiner's studio. The final difficult six months of Steiner's life were spent confined to his studio in the Schreinerei complex. The Schreinerei is the most unpretentious of buildings in the Goetheanum precinct. Yet, it has stood the test of time. It has been a silent witness of the key events in the life of the hill of Dornach. It served Rudolf Steiner as a productive workspace for over a decade. And it has served the Anthroposophy movement for over a century, with versatility, in a multitude of roles, all in the best traditions of a shed. \"Rudolf Steiner, founder of the Anthroposophical Society, is renowned for his work in widely varied fields. However, his accomplishments as an architect are less well understood. His two greatest achievements in this field - two buildings known as 'Geotheanum I' and 'Goetheanum II' (built after the destruction of the 1st) - have been described as 'sculptural architecture', of a kind similar Expressionist form to Gaudi, Obrist, and Finsterlin. The focus of this chapter, Goetheanum II, is a giant sculptured form, four stories high, with sweeping lines that give the effect of a giant monolithic mass. It is home to the Anthroposophical movement, and holds a 1,000 seat performance hall in which spiritual performances take place. Contributors to an issue of the Swiss architectural magazine Werk, in 1960, on the building, agreed that the building's design must have required \"a uniform worldview and lifestyle.\" Indeed, to understand the Goetheanum requires an understanding of Anthroposophy and of Steiner himself. This chapter looks at the meaning in the aesthetic choices of Steiner in the design and construction of the Goetheanum II. Steiner's belief that the people of Western Europe needed to re-orientate their weltanschauung is understood as a spiritual need. Interestingly, it was a view shared by many Expressionist artists. Steiner could not have been unaware of a number of significant Expressionistic philosophies and forms present in Europe during his formative period. As a lecturer he travelled extensively, and came into contact with many artists and writers who shared similar ideas. His vision for the Goetheanum was grandiose, like those of many other Expressionists, though unlike many others he had the opportunity to build his vision himself. The Goetheanum has also been referred to as a gesamtkunstwerk, also a theme common in the German art scene at the time. Yet Steiner wanted something 'new' for his nascent spiritual group; \"Not to build in a style born out of our spiritual world view, would mean to deny Anthroposphy in her own house.\" As a result the Geotheanum expresses Anthroposophical ideals, a movement which itself professed to inhabit the entire cultural life of its adherents. For Steiner this was came in the form of spiritual realisation, which could best be achieved in the sculptural shapes and organic forms of the Goetheanum\" Journal of Organics Journal of Fine Arts A century has elapsed since the inauguration (on 26 September, 1920) of a remarkable piece of architecture, Rudolf Steiner's Goetheanum, headquarters of the Anthroposophy movement, on a verdant hilltop on the outskirts of the Swiss village of Dornach, near Basel. The Goetheanum was an all timber structure, sitting on concrete footings and roofed with Norwegian slate. The building was begun in 1913, and construction progressed through the First World War. Rudolf Steiner's intention was to take architecture in a new and organic direction. On New Year's Eve, 31 December 1922, the Goetheanum hosted a Eurythmy performance followed by a lecture by Rudolf Steiner for members of the Anthroposophy Society. In the hours that followed, despite the fire-fighting efforts of the Anthroposophists and the local fire brigades, the building burned to the ground. The popular narrative is that the fire was arson but that was never proved. A local watchmaker and anthroposophist, Jakob Ott, was the only person to perish in the fire. He was falsely accused (in death) as 'the arsonist' but the evidence is rather that he perished in his brave efforts at saving the Goetheanum. Rudolf Steiner saw the \"calamity\" as an opportunity \"to change the sorrowful event into a blessing\". He promptly embarked on plans for a new building, Goetheanum II. This time there was to be \"no wood\". The short-lived Goetheanum I had served as a placeholder for Goetheanum II. This new Goetheanum, Rudolf Steiner's finest work of organic architecture, is of steel reinforced concrete and today stands on the Dornach hill right on the site of the old Goetheanum.

Wood, \"On the Spirit and Letter of Rudolf Steiner's Philosophy - A Critical Reading of Hartmut Traub's 'Philosophie und Anthroposophie'\": Originally published in on Steiner Education 4 (2013): 181-201. https://www.rosejourn.com/index.php/rose/article/view/147/0 Journal of Fine Arts The lost and last portrait of Edith Maryon (1872-1924), presented in the present paper, was painted by the Italian/Australian artist Ernesto Genoni (1885-1975) at Dornach in 1924. Maryon was appointed by Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) at the Christmas Conference of the Anthroposophy Society, December 1923, as the leader of the Section for Sculptural Arts (akna Fine Art). She was an English sculptor who worked with Steiner to create the massive timber sculpture, 'The Representative of Humanity', now on display in the Goetheanum, the headquarters of the Anthroposophical Society, at Dornach, Switzerland. Ernesto Genoni trained at the renowned Brera Academy of Fine Art in Milan. He first met Maryon in 1920 on his first visit to Dornach. Genoni returned to Dornach at about the time of the Christmas Conference, December 1923, he successfully applied to Steiner to be in the inaugural First Class of the School of Spiritual Science. Genoni remained in Dornach for most of the year 1924. Edith Maryon died on 2 May 1924 reportedly of tuberculosis (TB). Genoni left Dornach only after Steiner withdrew from public life and retreated to his sick bed (on 28 September 1924). Genoni took the art that he had created at Dornach back to Milan, Italy, and some of it went on to Australia when he emigrated in 1926. Genoni's portrait of Maryon has remained in the Genoni family in Milan since that time but with the subject long forgotten (or perhaps never known to the family). Genoni painted portraits of significant women in his life, including his sister Rosa and his niece Fanny (in Milan, Italy), and his partner Ileen Macpherson and his niece Anne Fiedler (in Melbourne, Australia). The portrait of this paper, is now identified as of Edith Maryon, thereby reuniting the artwork with its subject, and dating it in the last four months of Maryon's life (January to April 1924). The course is designed to provide students with an opportunity to conduct an independent research and develop efficient knowledge of the dynamics of architectural evolution in global perspective. Students will conduct an individual reading-writing-based intellectual investigation that will become a part of the publication project Alternative Spaces. They will study trends in twentieth and twenty-first century architecture, alternative to main-stream modernism. This class will examine the origins of holistic learning, and debate ideas of organic architecture, through advocating environmental sustainable concepts, landscape and landmarks preservation, green design, and discover influences of the philosophical and spiritual concept of anthroposophy on architecture, art and humanity. By integrating writing into learning curriculum and with introduction of basic research writing standards, we develop an understanding of cultural contexts through the study of internal processes and metamorphoses of the built environment, within examined historical frameworks. Journal of Organics Edith Ileen Macpherson (1898-1984) was a co-founder of Australia's (c.1934-1954) along with her partner Ernesto Genoni (1885-1974). Ileen was a member of Rudolf Steiner's Experimental Circle of Anthroposophic Farmers and Gardeners (from 1936). Ernesto was the first Australian member (from 1928). At their Demeter Farm in Dandenong, Victoria, they practiced biodynamic agriculture on over 40 acres (16 ha) through the years of the Great Depression, through World War II, and for the first decade of the post-war years, producing milk, fruit, and vegetables. Ileen was an early Australian Anthroposophist and follower of Rudolf Steiner. It was a blow to their Demeter Farm enterprise when she fell ill. Eventually she was no longer able to manage physical work at all and this fell to Ernesto. Although she is remembered as 'the woman in the wheelchair' this paper reveals that she was previously an active, fit and keen sportswoman, participating in basketball, tennis, running, hockey, and dancing. At school she was known as 'Ikey', she was a prefect, she was a member of the school sports committee, and she won the prize for \"best all-round sport\". Ileen was confined to a wheelchair for the last four decades of her life. The cause has generally been misunderstood and misattributed, and is revealed here to be pernicious anaemia (lack of vitamin B12). This condition is now easily and successfully treatable, but it was then generally fatal. Ileen was a financial supporter of the Anthroposophical movement in Australia during her lifetime. Her benefaction has continued since her death via the Ileen Macpherson Trust which reports having dispensed over $600,000 for Anthroposophic causes in Australia. A portrait of Ileen by Italian/Australian artist Ernesto Genoni and photographs of Ileen are presented. Approaching Religion The aim of this article is to examine how Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophical ideas were reflected and put into practice in the lives of the Finnish couple Olly (Olga) Donner (1881-1956, ne\u00e9 encountered anthroposophy in 1913 and subsequently embraced it as the guiding principle of their lives. Through a close examination of these two people we aim to shed light on how a new worldview like anthroposophy, which was gaining followers in early twentieth-century Finland, was also a manifestation of wider changes in religious culture in Europe. Our perspective could be described as biographical in the sense that it has been characterised by Simone L\u00e4ssig (2008: 11) who writes that 'the reconstruction of individual life courses helps to discover more about the context - for example, about daily rituals, pious practices, or kinship relationship'. Thus, the biographical perspective serves as a tool for grasping how something as deeply personal as an anthroposophical worldview was understood and practiced, not only by Olly and Uno Donner, but also by a larger group of people who in the early twentieth century were looking for new ways to make sense of the surrounding world.
