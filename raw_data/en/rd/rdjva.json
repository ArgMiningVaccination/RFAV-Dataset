HISTORY OF THE COLLEGE The Early Years The roots of Carolinas College of Health Sciences date back to the early 1940s when Charlotte Memorial Hospital, now Atrium Health's Carolinas Medical Center, provided hospital-based nursing and allied health training. Anchoring the College's history was the Charlotte Memorial Hospital School of Nursing and the Charlotte Memorial Hospital School of Medical Technology, which has been in continuous existence since 1942. During these early years, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hospital Authority (CMHA) responded to the growing healthcare industry and the need for a highly skilled workforce by opening the School of Radiologic Technology in 1955 followed by the School of Surgical Technology. Responding to the emergence of community colleges and the increasing number of nursing programs, 8 2020-2021 CATALOG & STUDENT HANDBOOK \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSthe Charlotte Memorial Hospital School of Nursing closed in 1967. However, 20 years later, realizing the need for registered nurses would exceed the number being educated in the community, the Charlotte- Mecklenburg Hospital Authority (CMHA), now Atrium Health, re-established the School of Nursing in the late 1980s. The Foundation for a New College The application to establish a new nursing program was submitted to the North Carolina Board of Nursing in 1990. Initial approval status was granted in May of 1990 and the first students were admitted in the fall of the same year. The College was originally located on Morehead Street on the campus of Carolinas Medical Center. Full approval status was granted, and the first class graduated in 1992. In December of 1993, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hospital Authority (CMHA) Board of Commissioners passed a resolution to incorporate the CMHA School of Nursing and to appoint a separate board of directors. Degree-granting authority was provided by the Hospital Authority Act [NC General Statute 113E- 23 (a) (31)] and was delegated to the College by the CMHA Board of Commissioners. In May of 1994, the College moved into the newly renovated Rankin Education Center on Blythe Boulevard on the campus of Carolinas Medical Center. Seeking to become more than a school of nursing, the foundation for a new college was set when, in 1995, the CMHA School of Nursing received initial accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to offer associate degrees. This regional accreditation was reaffirmed in 2000 and 2010 and will be reviewed again in 2020. In 1995, there were 146 students enrolled at the CMHA School of Nursing. Expanding the College In July of 1996, the CMHA School of Nursing Board of Directors changed the name of the school to Carolinas College of Health Sciences and approved plans to incorporate other healthcare programs. The existing hospital-based programs in Radiologic Technology and Surgical Technology joined the College in August of 1996 and the Medical Technology program joined in January of 1997. In 1999, the College began offering Nurse Aide I and Phlebotomy training; Nurse Aide II was offered for the first time in 2006. These three programs formed the original core of the continuing education department, opened in 2007. In 2007, there were 511 students enrolled at Carolinas College. To increase access to nursing education, Carolinas College expanded the role of general education and created the General Studies Pre-Nursing program in 2002. Originally a certificate program designed to provide a pathway into nursing, in 2011, the College developed a degree program in General Studies with a pre-nursing track. A Pre-Radiologic Technology track was added in August of 2014. In a partnership with Carolinas Medical Center's Pre-Hospital Medicine department, the Emergency Medical Sciences Program was started in 2003 offering paramedic education. This program was discontinued in 2008. In that same year, the board of directors approved the expansion of radiologic sciences by creating a program in Radiation Therapy. The first radiation therapy students were admitted in August 2009. In 2011, the Medical Technology Program became the Medical Laboratory Science Program. Also, in 2011, the College added Anesthesia Technology and a degree program in Surgical Technology. In 2013, the first Histotechnology students were accepted and in 2014, the College received approval to offer fully online distance education programs. In 2011, there were 424 students enrolled at Carolinas College. In 2015, as space on the College campus became more challenging, the Histotechnology program moved into vacant space on the campus of Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy. Looking to place more emphasis on programs and services focused on the future workforce needs of Atrium Health and the greater healthcare community, the College closed the Surgical Technology Program and graduated the last class of surgical technologists in May of 2018. In 2018, the College also closed the continuing education department, including the Nurse Aide I and II Programs, and transitioned the Phlebotomy program to Clinical Laboratory Sciences. The remaining continuing education programs were transferred to the Charlotte Area Health Education Center (AHEC). In 2019, there were over 600 students enrolled at Carolinas College. CAROLINAS COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES 9 \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSA Look into the Future In 2017, Carolinas College received approval from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) to confer baccalaureate degrees. Approval was also received to offer the first baccalaureate degree program, the Bachelor of Science in Nursing program designed for licensed nurses (RN-BSN), which was the College's first fully online degree program. The program first enrolled students in August of 2018 and the first cohort of students graduated in May of 2020. Following the board of director's approval to expand into Neurodiagnostic Technology in 2018, the College received permission from SACSCOC to create this program. The first students enrolled in January of 2020. Enhancing the opportunity for continued growth, Carolinas College relocated to a new and larger facility in December 2019. Looking to the future, Carolinas College is poised to grow strategically with the needs of Atrium Health, particularly in the areas of clinical laboratory sciences, diagnostic and imaging sciences, health sciences and nursing.Accolades Carolinas College continues to prepare graduates to exceed state and national certification testing benchmarks and to excel at graduating students into healthcare roles.

Readmission Processes Readmission A student seeking to return to a program following a withdrawal or dismissal, except after an approved leave of absence, must apply to be readmitted. The student submits the progression/readmission application packet with a nonrefundable application fee to the dean of student affairs and enrollment management. It is recommended that students complete a program within 150% of normal completion time. A dismissed or withdrawn student is eligible for readmission to the same program only one time. If a student has been away from a program for 12 or more months, they must reapply through the regular admissions process. A student applying for readmission to the College must reenter no later than one year from the last successfully completed applied course. Applied courses (i.e., NUR, RAD, NDT, etc.) must be repeated if the length of time between successful completion of a course and readmission to a consecutive course exceeds one calendar year or if substantial curriculum changes have occurred. Students applying for readmission into the first course in a healthcare program must do so by the published deadlines for that start date, otherwise, the deadline for applying for readmission is generally three months prior to the anticipated start date. Applicants for readmission known to be in default on a student loan or owing money to the College will not be considered for readmission nor will those ineligible for clinical placement with Atrium Health. A student may be readmitted to a program only once. Readmitted students who are unsuccessful in any subsequent master curriculum course will be academically dismissed and ineligible for readmission into their current program. A student dismissed from a clinical program can opt to complete the General Studies associate degree program.22 2020-2021 CATALOG & STUDENT HANDBOOK \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSApplications for readmission are reviewed by the Academic, Progression and Graduation (APG) Committee, with decisions based on the following: Interview with the APG Committee (required for students who were dismissed; if requested by the APG committee for students who withdrew or on an APG approved leave of absence). Academic and administrative experience at the College. Exit information provided by the program chair, faculty, student success coordinator, and/or others, related to factors that may have led to the withdrawal/dismissal of the student (e.g., progression paperwork). Actions taken to remedy problems that interfered with prior success, if relevant. Anticipated probability of success upon reentry. Space availability. Additional aspects of progression and readmission are addressed in program-specific sections of this catalog. Transfer and Advanced Standing Credit The College recognizes knowledge and competence attained through formal, non-formal and non-traditional approaches to learning. The director of student records and information management will evaluate the transcripts of all applicants who accept their offer of admission for advanced standing credit. All advanced standing credit will be considered transfer credit, will not earn a grade and will not be used to compute the grade point average. Comparable courses with grades of \"C\" or better from institutions with US Department of Education or Council for Higher Education Accreditation approval, advanced placement examinations, SAT scores, CLEP scores and/or challenge examinations may be considered for credit. \"Comparable courses\" are those which are similar in breadth, depth and content to those at Carolinas College and are taught by faculty members with similar qualifications. To request consideration for additional transfer credit not awarded initially, students must submit the Transfer Credit Evaluation Request Form along with the course description and course syllabus for each course where credits were received from non-regionally accredited institutions or not initially believed to be equivalent to Carolinas College coursework. Challenge testing is approved and administered by the general studies program chair. Time limitations may apply for transfer credit. All transfer and advanced standing credit must be completed before entering the College, with the exception of those entering as non- degree seeking. Students may not be dually enrolled in another institution for the purpose of receiving transfer credit. Students must complete 25% of required program credits at Carolinas College. Students can receive a maximum of 75% of the total coursework required for graduation from any program through advanced standing or transfer credit. All requests for evaluation for advanced standing credit must be completed within a student's first term of enrollment.

Financial assistance can be in the form of federal loans and grants, state and other sources of loans and grants, and scholarships. For the most up-to-date financial aid information, please visit the college website, CarolinasCollege.edu. HOW TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL AID AT CAROLINAS COLLEGE All students who attend Carolinas College must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form whether they intend to use federal financial aid to pay their expenses or not. Data collected in the FAFSA form is used in the awarding process for loans, grants, and scholarships. In order to receive maximum consideration for all available financial aid programs, the FAFSA should be filed by April 15th prior to each academic year for which a student wishes to be considered for financial aid. The standard academic year is August - July each year. When submitting the FAFSA form, students must request that it be sent to: Carolinas College FAFSA school code: 031042. CAROLINAS COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES 27 \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSTYPES OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE The majority of financial aid that is awarded is in the form of federal loans and grants. Federal Pell Grants are awarded to eligible undergraduate students who have not earned a bachelor's or professional degree. Eligibility is based on the FAFSA results, need, and the number of credit hours in which the student is enrolled. The federal government limits the total terms a student can receive the Federal Pell Grant. The Federal Pell Grant does not have to be repaid. A Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) is for undergraduate students with exceptional financial need; that is, students with the lowest EFC with priority given to students who receive Federal Pell Grants. FSEOG is a need-based grant that does not have to be repaid. Federal Work Study provides part-time jobs for undergraduate, graduate and professional students with financial need allowing them to earn money to help pay education expenses. The program encourages community service work and work related to the student's program(s) of study. This program helps students to lower their potential loan debt. 28 2020-2021 CATALOG & STUDENT HANDBOOK \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSWilliam D. Ford Federal Direct Loans The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program provides low interest loans for students and parents to help pay post-secondary education expenses. The lender is the U.S. Department of Education rather than a bank or other financial institution. In 2013, Congress passed and the President signed the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act, which ties federal student loan interest rates to financial markets. Under this Act, interest rates will be determined each June for new loans being made for the upcoming award year, which runs from July 1 to the following June 30. Each loan will have a fixed interest rate for the life of the loan. There are three types of William D. Ford Federal Loans Direct Subsidized Loans are for students with demonstrated financial need, as determined by the FASFA. No interest is charged while a student is enrolled in school at least half-time. For first-time borrowers after July 1, 2013, there is a \"maximum eligibility period\" (measured in academic years) of 150% of the published length of the program(s) that can receive Direct Subsidized Loans. The time limit does not apply to Direct Unsubsidized Loans or Direct PLUS Loans. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are not based on financial need; interest is charged during all enrollment periods and are available to undergraduate and graduate students. Direct Plus Loans are low-interest loans for parents of dependent students and graduate students. Interest is charged during all enrollment periods, beginning on the date of the loan's first disbursement. Approval is subject to a credit check to determine credit worthiness. Parents may apply online at studentloans.gov and will also use their FSA ID number from the FASFA to electronically sign the application, and if approved, the Parent Loan Agreement (Master Promissory Note). Dependent student whose parents are ineligible for a Direct Plus Loan may be eligible to receive additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan funds. Fees and Rates Associated with Direct Loans Loan Origination Fees Most federal student loans have loan fees that are deducted proportionately from each loan disbursement that is received. This means the money received will be less than the amount that was borrowed. For information on current interest rates and origination fees associated with these federal loans please visit: studentloans.gov. Academic Year Loan Limits as determined by Federal guidelines Dependent Students (except students whose parents are unable to obtain PLUS Loans) First-Year Undergraduate Annual Loan Limit $5,500 - No more than $3,500 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. Second-Year Undergraduate Annual Loan Limit $6,500 - No more than $4,500 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. Third Year and Beyond Undergraduate Annual Loan Limit $7,500 - No more than $5,500 of this amount may be in subsidized loans. Subsidized and Unsubsidized Aggregate Loan Limit $31,000 - No more than $23,000 of this amount may be in subsidized loans.

Private loans are offered by private lenders and there are no federal forms to complete. When completing an application for a Private Education Loan, Carolinas College may be listed as Charlotte Mecklenburg Hospital Authority. Please note these loans usually have higher interest rates and repayment terms.

For more information please visit cfnc.org/FELS. North Carolinas Need-Based Scholarship Program Created by the 2011 North Carolina General Assembly, this is a need-based program for NC residents attending an institution of higher education located in North Carolina. For more information please visit cfnc.org/NBS. THE FINANCIAL AID AWARDING PROCESS Most financial aid is awarded based on need. The amount of an award varies depending upon the student's verified financial need. Financial aid will only be awarded to students who meet the federal and state eligibility requirements. Information provided on the FAFSA and the amount of funds available for distribution determine the award amount. Need is determined by subtracting the resources of the student and the Expected Family's Contribution (EFC) from the total cost of attendance based on the student's program(s) of study. The total financial aid awarded cannot exceed the published cost of attendance. The total cost of attendance is determined by the financial aid office and may include tuition, fees, room and board, books, transportation, and miscellaneous expenses. The award may include a combination of funds from loans, grants and scholarships. Financial aid awards from loans, grants and scholarships are applied to the cost of attending Carolinas College and are generally credited directly to the student's account. Federal financial aid cannot be used to pay for repeats of courses already successfully completed at Carolinas College or courses outside the student's program(s) of study. A student borrowing loans for the first time at Carolinas College must complete the Loan Agreement (Master Promissory Note) and Loan Entrance Counseling. Both documents can be found on online at studentloans. gov. Students must use their FSA ID number from the FASFA to electronically sign the Master Promissory Note. Students are encouraged to complete the Financial Awareness Counseling that can also be found online at studentloans.gov. For the school selection, Carolinas College is listed as Charlotte Mecklenburg Hospital Authority. Each year, students are notified of their financial aid award with a letter posted to their account in SONIS, Carolinas College's student information system. Students are required to accept, deny or modify (lower the amount) their award electronically. CAROLINAS COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES 33 \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSDISBURSEMENTS Each term, a student who is awarded financial aid from Carolinas College will have the award credited to their student account. A student not enrolled for the number of credit hours that were estimated at the time of financial aid packaging will have award eligibility recalculated. This may affect the student's eligibility for certain types of federal aid. If a credit balance is generated after the financial aid award is applied to a student's account, a refund check will be issued to the student. A student borrowing Federal Direct Loans for the first time at Carolinas College must have completed the Loan Entrance Counseling and the Loan Agreement (Master Promissory Note) prior to the release of funds and mailing of the refund check. Refund checks are mailed to the address on file in SONIS. It is the student's responsibility to keep that address updated. The College is not responsible for checks mailed to the wrong address because the student failed to keep it updated in SONIS. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS FOR FINANCIAL AID - MAINTAINING ELIGIBILITY FOR FEDERAL AID The federal Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) standard for financial aid is different than the institution's standard by the same name to establish a student's academic standing at Carolinas College. Students must meet the federal SAP standard to maintain eligibility for federal financial aid. Satisfactory academic progress is measured once at the end of each semester for all degree and diploma programs. Students who withdraw or take an approved leave of absence will have satisfactory academic progress measured upon their notification of intent to return and before re-enrolling. The Financial Aid Director will review students who receive financial aid to determine their eligibility to continue to receive financial aid based on both qualitative and quantitative criteria. Qualitative Criteria 1. Undergraduate students must maintain a 2.0 cumulative Grade Point Average. 2. Only the grade obtained for a repeated course will be used in determining Grade Point Average and is considered the final grade. Quantitative Criteria 1. Hours Attempted: 67% of the total credit hours attempted must be successfully completed. Hours attempted include transfer hours accepted, hours for courses that are repeated, hours from course withdrawal, hours for courses failed, and hours for courses successfully passed. 2. Maximum Time Frame: Federal regulations limit the maximum time frame to no more than 150% of the published length of the program as measured in credit hours. a. Example of the 150% rule is: Program requires 72 credit hours/students are eligible up to 108 attempted credit hours. 72 credits x 150% = 108 credit hours attempted. All enrollment periods, including those in which students did not receive financial aid, are evaluated to determine if the student meets the quantitative and qualitative standards. For students who change programs/ majors, only the credits attempted and accepted by the registrar toward the new major will be included in the calculation of Satisfactory Academic Progress. Students not meeting either the qualitative or quantitative criteria for Satisfactory Academic Progress will be notified and placed on financial aid probation for the next term. If the student has not re-gained eligibility after completion of the probationary term, they will not be eligible for financial aid until they are able to re-establish satisfactory academic progress.34 2020-2021 CATALOG & STUDENT HANDBOOK \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSFinancial Aid Eligibility Appeals If a student is determined to be ineligible for financial aid due to failure to meet the Satisfactory Academic Progress standard after the probationary term, the student can appeal the decision. Decisions regarding financial aid continued eligibility (except the 150% rule) may be appealed in writing to the dean of student affairs and enrollment management. The appeal must be in writing and must include: 1. Student's name 2. The last 4 digits of the social security number 3. Facts upon which the appeal is based 4. A statement of why the student failed to meet the SAP requirements and what has changed to allow the student to be successful Bases for an appeal can include, but are not limited to: 1. Extended illness or hospitalization of the student 2. An accident which incapacitates the student for an extended period of time 3. Death or extended illness of an immediate family member 4. Unusual financial/work related situations Students will be notified of the appeal decision within two weeks of receipt of the written appeal request. If the appeal is approved, the student will be considered on SAP probation and will receive available financial aid for one additional term only. If the appeal is denied, the student is ineligible to receive financial aid until they meet all of the SAP requirements. Satisfactory Academic Progress probation is only granted one time per student. RETURN OF TITLE IV FUNDS Title IV funds and State funds are awarded to a student under the assumption that the student will attend school for the entire period for which the assistance is awarded. When a student withdraws, the student may no longer be eligible for the full amount of Title IV and State funds that the student was originally scheduled to receive. If a recipient of a Title IV grant, loans funds, and/or state funds withdraws from the College before the 60% point of the term, a portion of the awarded funds must be returned to the federal aid program after calculation of the return to Title IV Funds. This may result in a balance on the student's account. Students should consult with financial aid in advance when considering withdrawal or a leave of absence from the College.

Intellectual Property Intellectual property is an important asset to the Carolinas College educational community and the College seeks to uphold the highest standards of clear institutional direction regarding ownership, compensation, copyrights and use of the revenue derived from such property. Additionally, the College wishes to ensure that best current practices are modeled in delineating the legal rights to products of the mind and the intended or unintended access to such property. For this reason, Carolinas College chooses to default to Atrium Health's equivalent policy: Ownership and Commercialization of Intellectual Property (ADM 240.07) and this policy will apply to all Carolinas College staff, faculty and students. It addresses all categories of intellectual property and related issues such as ownership, governance and dissemination of intellectual property. The policy is available to staff and faculty through the Atrium Health Policy Manual and is accessible to students through the student affairs office.42 2020-2021 CATALOG & STUDENT HANDBOOK \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTS College Standards & Expectations for Professional Behavior Carolinas College seeks to provide an environment in which learning, teaching and related activities are undertaken freely, safely, responsibly and without distraction. We exist in a diverse campus community, so our actions must be motivated not only by personal concerns but also by the concerns of our healthcare system partner, the community and the welfare of the College. The College has outlined the expectations for professional behavior through policies governing community standards, code of student conduct, academic integrity and standards of clinical practice. COMMUNITY STANDARDS The policies and procedures of the College establish standards of professional conduct such that each member of the College community has the freedom to pursue academic and curricular activities in an educational context of healthy, responsible, ethical and respectful behavior. Disruptive Behavior Disruptive behavior includes but is not limited to inappropriate behavior, sleeping in class or clinical, failure to turn off cell phones or other electronic devices or violating computer restrictions. Course faculty have the right to remove a student from the classroom or a clinical experience for disruptive behavior and/or to refer the matter to the dean of student affairs for investigation and potential disciplinary action. Tobacco Use Carolinas College and Atrium Health are committed to promoting clean and healthy environments. Carolinas College and all Atrium Health-owned or leased property (including vehicles), parking lots, decks, stairwells and outside areas next to building entrances and exits have been designated as tobacco-free areas. Carolinas College abides by Atrium Health's Tobacco-Free Workplace policy (HR-5.12) which defines tobacco products as any form of tobacco, including, but not limited to, cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, vapor sticks, cigars, pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco and snuff. Use of these products is prohibited while on the Carolinas College campus, in clinical training sites and all Atrium Health facilities as defined above. Violations of this policy will be adjudicated as stated in policy HR-5.12. For a student, any violation is considered academic misconduct. The student is subject to counseling up to, and including, removal from the program. CAROLINAS COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES 43 \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSDrug & Alcohol Use Carolinas College students and teammates are expected to comply with Atrium Health's Drug and Alcohol Use policy (HR-4.08). Carolinas College and Atrium Health want team members to be secure that their working environment is safe. To provide this safety and high team member performance, alcohol or illegal drugs cannot be in a student's body while training in the clinical setting or on the Carolinas College campus. Students taking prescription and non-prescription drugs that may affect their ability to perform assigned duties must report this to the faculty member. The use of illegal drugs or alcohol during scheduled school hours or the possession of illegal drugs or alcohol on campus at any time will result in disciplinary action including, but not limited to, counseling, EAP referral, or dismissal from the College. Following the initial baseline drug screen required of all new clinical or laboratory science students, additional drug and alcohol tests may be conducted randomly or for cause to ensure compliance. Failure to comply with a request for drug or alcohol testing is treated as a positive test. A positive test will result in suspension of clinical access, which may negatively affect progress in the program. If a positive test is within the first 90 days of enrollment, the student will be dismissed. Students enrolled more than 90 days with positive tests will be referred to Teammate Health and/or the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for case management to include assessment for treatment needs and any referrals. However, a student's continued enrollment is subject to the Clinical Access and Eligibility policy. Students may be allowed to return to class and clinical based on cooperation and treatment assessment after consultation between Teammate Health, EAP and the dean of student affairs. A student who is allowed to return to class or clinical will be dismissed for a subsequent positive drug or alcohol test. Students dismissed due to drug or alcohol violations may not be readmitted earlier than one year from the term in which dismissal occurred. Charges, Convictions or Sanctions Carolinas College students and teammates are expected to comply with Atrium Health's Charges, Convictions or Sanctions policy (HR-5.19). Carolinas College and Atrium Health want to provide the best educational and clinical training experiences and environments. An essential element of this is creating an environment where faculty, staff and students feel safe. If a student receives a criminal charge, conviction, or a sanction, this potentially creates a safety and security issue in the educational and clinical training environment. For that reason, students are to report, in writing, any criminal charge, conviction or sanction to the dean of student affairs by the next calendar day. If a copy of the charge, conviction or sanction is not available that day, the student is to provide it within five (5) calendar days to the dean of student affairs. Examples of offenses to be reported may include, but are not limited to: violence, injury to another person, communicating threats, damage to property, sexual offenses, drug offenses, driving while intoxicated (DWI) or driving under the influence (DUI), theft, fraud, including writing fraudulent checks. Sanctions can include temporary suspension from class, letter of warning, disciplinary counseling, action plan, loss of clinical access or dismissal. Sanctions up to and including development of an action plan may be imposed by the dean of student affairs or provost. Sanctions of restricted access or dismissal will be made only by APG committee action or when policy mandates (i.e., drug and alcohol violation, firearms violation). Psychological Impairment Students are expected and required to be in appropriate mental condition to perform assigned tasks or to participate in class, lab or clinical activities. College personnel rely upon the expertise of professionals with Teammate Health and the Employee Assistance Program regarding degree of impairment, treatment and an assessment of readiness to return to school. Intimidation and Harassment The College prohibits and will not tolerate acts of intimidation, sexual harassment or abuse. Such behaviors violate the privacy and dignity of individuals and are a violation of federal and state laws. Intimidation includes, but is not limited to, actions or speech that causes another person to believe his or her personal safety or personal property may be at risk or harm.44 2020-2021 CATALOG & STUDENT HANDBOOK \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSHarassment of any kind will not be tolerated. Harassment relating to race, sex, religion, ancestry, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status or any other protected status is inconsistent with the College's commitment to create and maintain an educational environment that is safe and responsible and that supports and rewards achievement on the basis of ability and performance. All students, faculty, and staff are required to complete Title IX training on an annual basis. Complaints of sexual harassment will be investigated by the College's Title IX coordinator, Ms. Sandra Harvey. Ms. Harvey can be reached at Sandra.Harvey@carolinascollege.edu or at (704) 468-2155. Other complaints of intimidation and harassment will be investigated by the dean of student affairs, Dr. Karen Lewis. To file a complaint, Dr. Lewis can be reached at Karen.Lewis@carolinascollege.edu or (704) 355-5585. Weapons Atrium Health, under North Carolina law (NCGS Section 14-415.23(a)), has adopted an ordinance prohibiting the possession of firearms or other weapons on campus. This prohibition is posted on all buildings including 2110 Water Ridge Parkway, which houses Carolinas College of Health Sciences. The possession of firearms and other weapons on campus will result in immediate administrative dismissal from the College. Dress Code Students are considered part of the patient care team so it is important to project a respectful, professional, competent image to Atrium Health teammates, patients and fellow students. To project a professional image, to standardize expectations and to be consistent with Atrium Health standards, students are expected to follow the specific standards of appearance outlined below. College-issued identification badges will be worn at all times at chest level or above with the student's picture clearly visible. On the college's campus, students are expected to dress modestly and in good taste, including but not limited to: No tank tops. No exposure of midriff. No low-cut shirts or blouses.

STANDARDS OF CLINICAL PRACTICE HIPAA Students who are enrolled in programs with a clinical component are required to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy regulations and related Atrium Health policies and procedures (collectively, the \"Privacy Standards\"). Failure to comply with the HIPAA privacy standards will result in disciplinary action. The disciplinary action is based on the severity and context of the violation and is outlined in the College's policy and procedure manual. Students enrolled in clinical programs receive HIPAA education upon admission, annually via continuing education modules (ACE Modules), in the classroom and through routine education provided in the monthly college newsletter. CAROLINAS COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES 53 \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSClinical Safety The faculty in clinical programs provide learning opportunities so that students can develop and demonstrate competence in the skills necessary to practice in their profession. The student is expected to contribute to the safety and well-being of the patient/client and practice in the clinical setting in a safe and responsible way towards him/herself, clinical professionals and the environment. Students may be disciplined and/or dismissed from a program of study for unsafe clinical practices. Unsafe clinical practice is defined as a failure to assess or act appropriately on information that a majority of students at the same level would recognize as important to client health and safety. In addition, unsafe clinical practice may be the result of poor judgement, inadequate preparation for client care and/or poor decision-making skills that can lead to life-threatening safety violations. Additional examples of unsafe practices may include, but are not limited to: Exhibiting behavioral problems that result in unsafe clinical practices. Requiring an inordinate amount of the instructor's time in the clinical setting, jeopardizing the adequacy of supervision of other students. Requiring a significantly longer time than other classmates to perform the same procedures or tasks. Possessing a disability for which reasonable accommodations will not prevent unsafe clinical practices. Losing access to clinical facility placement. Violating the HIPAA policy. Refusing to participate in a clinical facility investigation related to an alleged HIPAA violation or a patient safety matter. Refusing to participate in a simulated or virtual clinical experience or an alternative learning activity. When a safety infraction occurs: 1. The instructor will discuss the issue/event with the student and determine whether the student will remain in the clinical setting. 2. The instructor will notify the clinical coordinator and/or program chair of the incident. 3. For minor infractions, the instructor (and clinical coordinator or program chair, if necessary) will meet with the student to provide counseling and/or develop an action plan with the student. 4. More severe infractions may result in a recommendation for dismissal. Recommendations for dismissal are submitted to the provost and dean of student affairs and enrollment management and are referred to the APG committee for consideration following the Dismissal policy. ADMINISTRATIVE DISMISSAL Students are expected to behave in a manner consistent with the expectations required of practicing professionals. A student will be administratively dismissed from the College when it is determined that the student: Fails to adhere to the Community Standards. Violates the Code of Conduct.

Credit Hours The unit of credit measurement is the credit hour, calculated using 50 minutes of contact time. One credit hour is equivalent to one of the following online and face-to-face instructional experiences: 1) one hour of didactic instruction per week; 2) three hours of clinical or laboratory instruction per week; or 3) six hours of practicum instruction per week. Instruction may occur synchronously or asynchronously on campus or online in a virtual or simulated environment. All calculations are based on a standard 15-week term plus an examination period. Credit calculations for courses offered on a non-standard term format will include an equivalent total number of class, clinical, laboratory or practicum hours of instruction. Students enrolled in 12 or more credit hours are considered full-time. Non-credit courses are measured by contact hours.58 2020-2021 CATALOG & STUDENT HANDBOOK \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSInstitutional Student Learning Outcomes At Carolinas College, students complete instructional activities in various learning environments (e.g., classroom, online, laboratory, clinical) to develop skills to prepare them for entry into healthcare and other professions. The work students complete also helps develop important intellectual skills and essential personal and professional behaviors. These important areas of focus are referred to as Institutional Student Learning Outcomes. In addition to understanding and applying a core body of knowledge in their chosen field of study, a Carolinas College of Health Sciences graduate will be able to: Communicate: Use oral and written communication effectively. Consider: Integrate theory and evidence to make sound decisions, solve problems and evaluate results. Collaborate: Work as an effective team member to achieve objectives. Cultivate: Engage in professional behaviors to promote self-directed growth. Connect: Build and maintain relationships with others from various professions, perspectives and practices. Quality Enhancement Plan Carolinas College has developed a Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP) focused on enhancing collaboration and connection among students pursuing different professions, or interprofessional teamwork, to better prepare graduates for the evolving healthcare environment. Interprofessional education (IPE) has been shown to increase interprofessional collaboration and teamwork between healthcare groups with the result of improved safety and higher quality care for patients. Various IPE activities will be integrated throughout the curriculum of academic programs to ensure that graduates are able to: Identify the values and ethics of healthcare professionals and the impact of these on health outcomes. Recognize one's own role and responsibilities and those of other professions in providing effective healthcare. Communicate effectively with other health professionals in classroom and clinical settings. Collaborate in interprofessional healthcare teams in classroom and clinical settings. Types of Courses The college offers three types of courses: Applied Courses are offered in most programs, are specific to the discipline and are intended to prepare graduates to practice entry-level healthcare. General Studies Courses are a substantial component of each undergraduate degree program. Degree programs include at least one course from each of the following areas: humanities/fine arts, social/ behavioral sciences and natural sciences/mathematics. The general studies core ensures a breadth of knowledge to promote intellectual inquiry and includes courses that expose students to a broad understanding of society and self. That understanding prepares students to develop into responsible professionals in the health sciences. Special Studies Courses, which can include emerging issues or specialized content, provide a basic exposure to skills and concepts useful to the training of healthcare professionals. Special topics courses may be interdisciplinary in nature.CONNECTCULTIVATE COLLABORATE CO M M UNICATE CONSIDER CAROLINAS COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES 59 \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSCommunication COM 101 Communication 3 ENG 101 English Composition 3 ENG 240 Research and Evaluation 3 Humanities/Fine Arts ENG 231 Early American Literature 3 ENG 235 Film as Literature 3 PHI 201 Ethics 3 Social/Behavioral Sciences PSY 101 General Psychology 3 PSY 241 Human Growth and Development 3 SOC 101 Introduction to Sociology 3 SOC 210 Diversity & Inclusion 3 IDS 301 Biopsychosocial Aspects of Aging 3Natural Sciences/Mathematics BIO 168 Human Anatomy and Physiology I 4 BIO 169 Human Anatomy and Physiology II 4 BIO 130 Introduction to Neuroscience 3 BIO 200 Microbiology 4 MAT 101 College Math 3 MAT 201 Elementary Statistics 3 Electives HEA 109 Health and Wellness 3 Special Studies Courses HLC 102 Medical Terminology 2 HLC 200 Special Topics in Healthcare 1-4General Education and Special Studies Courses Distance Education Courses Carolinas College defines distance education as instructional activity that occurs with a separation by time or space between the student and the instructor. Distance education can include online instruction, simulated instruction, virtual clinical or laboratory instruction, or any other e-learning activities. Courses with distance education components provide the same high-quality instruction for students as traditional on-campus courses. The registration process, fees and academic credit are the same for distance education courses as for traditional on-campus classes. Students should be comfortable navigating the internet and be prepared to attend mandatory on-campus meetings and/or join live video conference sessions at set meeting times for course requirements as needed. Students complete coursework using technology such as email, multimedia, chat rooms and discussion forums, and can access course information (syllabi, handouts, grades) through the information portal.The following table identifies general studies courses. Not every course is offered every term, so students should refer to the current registration bulletin for course availability. General studies core courses are identified in italics.60 2020-2021 CATALOG & STUDENT HANDBOOK \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSDistance education courses fall into the following classifications and are identified as such in the registration bulletin: Type of CoursePercent of Content Delivered OnlineDescription of Course Activities Traditional 0% Course with no online technology used. Web-enhanced 1% - 25% A traditional course that meets in the classroom for most of the regularly scheduled class time but uses web-based technology for purposes of supplementing the course by publishing course materials, delivering lectures, facilitating discussions, extending office hours, posting course grades, etc. Hybrid 26% - 50% A course that blends instructional methodologies so that a portion of regularly scheduled class time is replaced with online activities. Online 51% - 100% A course in which most or all of the content is delivered online. May have only a few or no required face-to-face meetings. Course Scheduling The director of student records and information management generates the course schedule and registration materials approximately 90 days prior to the first day of classes each term. Section assignments are generally on a first-come, first-served basis with priority provided to students in a clinical program. Students requesting sections that are full should register for an open section and place their name on the wait list for a possible opening. Student schedules can be viewed online and printed. Students who want to drop a class that does not affect the master curriculum plan may do so online during the drop/add period. If the desired drop affects the master curriculum plan, requests must be approved by the student's advisor, the instructor and the program chair. Classes may be added after the drop/add period only with the approval of the instructor and the dean of student affairs. Students withdrawing from a class after the drop/add period will receive a grade as described below in the grading section. Students will be counseled by their advisor if the change affects progress toward completion of the students' master curriculum plan. Section changes are considered drop/add transactions and are handled as such. No section changes of healthcare classes will be made without the approval of the program chair. General studies course section changes will be made upon approval of the involved faculty members. After the drop/add period, section changes are made by the director of student records and information management. Transfer credit may be awarded for classes of equivalent depth, breadth and content if relevant to the program of enrollment. Advanced standing credit may be awarded through testing according to college policy which is available through faculty advisors and student affairs personnel. Registration The College will provide an orderly process for class selection and registration. The process will ensure the timely development of a schedule that meets student and program needs as well as a process that provides equity in course availability and guidance in course selection. Before the start of registration, all students are required CAROLINAS COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES 61 \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSto meet with their academic advisor. Upon meeting, the advisor will release the registration hold allowing the student to register. Students may change their schedule by dropping or adding courses through the first week of the term. If there is a registration hold on the student's account, he/she will be electronically blocked from registration for the next term until the hold is cleared. Registration holds may be applied for financial or academic reasons. Program and Course Syllabi A syllabus is a document that communicates information to students about the college, program or a specific course. The program syllabus provides an overview of expectations and policies relevant to a student's program as well as the college. The course syllabus is more narrow in focus and outlines the expectations and objectives that must be met in course work, lab, and/or clinical experiences in order to ensure successful completion of the course. Students should refer to both syllabi for guidelines on requirements and expectations. The college reserves the right to alter the course requirements, mode of delivery, schedule, and/or assignments based on new materials, class discussions, or other legitimate pedagogical objectives or emergency situations. Students will be given notice of relevant changes in class, via e-mail and/or the College learning management system. Syllabi are available on the information portal. Plagiarism Detection and Prevention Plagiarism prevention is facilitated through the use of a plagiarism detection tools. These tools helps users detect and prevent plagiarism from sites, full-text published Internet sources, peer works and prior self-works. Students are advised to use the available plagiarism detection tools to revise and update assignment content prior to final submission. Carolinas College faculty may either require students to submit written assignments electronically for review or the work may be submitted automatically as part of completing the assignment. Attendance Traditional classes offered by the College are designed for class attendance and it is assumed that students will be present. Attendance will be recorded at each class meeting and within each online, simulated or virtual course and attendance records are to be maintained so as to be accessible to support staff and administrative team members as needed. Students who miss class, regardless of reason, will be responsible for the work missed. Specific course attendance requirements are identified in each course syllabus. Students who are in violation of the specified course attendance policy will be contacted by the faculty member, referred to the student success coordinator for assistance, and/or provided with instructions for withdrawing from the course if necessary. A student may lose access to a course when the number of allowed absences (if stipulated) has been exceeded, or when, in the opinion of the faculty member, the student has missed so much work as to preclude the possibility of successful completion of the class. Unless otherwise specified in the course syllabus, students that lose course access due to attendance will be able to withdraw from the course up until the withdrawal deadline. In online and hybrid classes, attendance is defined as regular weekly completion of assignments. Students must confirm enrollment in online courses by logging in to the course during the first week of classes and completing the first assignment by the specified due date. Course syllabi provide specific expectations. Testing Guidelines All examinations and tests are property of Carolinas College of Health Sciences and are not to be distributed to individuals outside the program. Guidelines are established by each program in order to ensure academic integrity and enhance the testing environment. Students are expected to comply with faculty requests, established testing guidelines and technical requirements promptly. Students with documented special accommodations (i.e., additional testing time, small testing room, etc.) are responsible for making the lead instructor of each course aware of individual needs during the first week of each course. Additional specific requirements may be included in each program and course syllabus. 62 2020-2021 CATALOG & STUDENT HANDBOOK \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSClinical Rotations Completion of clinical rotations is a requirement for clinical programs. Access to clinical sites is governed, in part, by clinical contracts. Access to Atrium Health clinical facilities requires an acceptable criminal background check, negative drug and alcohol screen, and compliance with applicable clinical policies of Carolinas College and Atrium Health. To ensure students will be able to complete programmatic requirements, clinical site availability is evaluated to determine the capacity for program enrollment. In the event a lack of clinical site availability may impact students' ability to progress, students will be notified immediately. To guarantee clinical placement, the program chair and faculty can implement various changes, including but not limited to: Identifying alternate clinical sites Adjusting clinical schedules Adjusting course schedules Adjusting curriculum plans Providing online, virtual or simulated clinical experiences Grading The College uses a letter system of grading. Ranges for letter grades are determined by each program and are indicated on each course syllabus or in the program portion of this catalog/handbook. The lowest passing grade in any course in the curriculum is a letter grade of \"C.\" Cumulative scores will be rounded off to the nearest whole number with the raw score of 0.50 or higher being rounded up to the next whole number. \"S\" (Satisfactory) and \"U\" (Unsatisfactory) may be used as clinical/lab grades. An \"S\" in the clinical/lab component of the course results in the grade earned in theory for the course. A \"U\" results in a grade of \"F\" for the course. CAROLINAS COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES 63 \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSAn \"I\" (Incomplete) is a temporary grade and must be removed within the time period identified, not to exceed three months. Failure to do so results in a grade of \"F.\" Grades of \"I\" must be removed prior to enrollment in courses that identify the incomplete course as a prerequisite. A \"P\" (Pass) may be used in a non-graded, non-credit certificate program. A \"W\" (Withdrawal) indicates the student withdrew prior to completion of 75% of the course based on the last date of attendance. A \"WF\" (Withdrawal/Failing) indicates a failing grade in the didactic portion of the NUR 202 course. The student success coordinator will receive an alert from the director of student records and information management of at-risk (\"D\" or \"F\") students at midterm. Final course grades will be available online for all students at the end of each term. Grades will not be provided over the telephone. Only an error in grade calculation is justification for change of a recorded grade. Special make-up work or an examination to change a grade already recorded is not permitted. Approved changes are communicated by the program chair to the director of student records and information management. A student who believes there is a grade discrepancy should see the faculty member or program chair immediately. Grade point averages (GPA and CGPA) are calculated electronically by multiplying the credit hours per course by the quality points earned and dividing by the total credit hours attempted. Grade Definition Quality Points A Superior 4.0 B Commendable 3.0 C Satisfactory 2.0 D Deficient, Non-passing 1.0 F Fail, Non-passing 0.0 I P W WF AU R TIncomplete Pass Withdrawal Withdrawal/failing Audit Repeat Transfer/testing credit* * * * * * * *Not used in computation of grade point average For repeats, the last grade replaces the previous grade in computing the GPA; however, all entries remain a part of the student's permanent record. For students receiving conditional admission through the pre-nursing or pre- radiologic technology tracks, only the first attempt at each course will be used to calculate the required GPA. Auditing A student may request to audit a course, or an audit may be prescribed. Per the Audit policy, a student must petition to audit a course at the point of registration. Once the class starts, the course designation of 'for credit' or 'audit' cannot be changed. Audits are available only if space is available. Normal prerequisites apply. Tuition will be the same as those taking the course for credit and all pertinent fees and policies will apply. If auditing only a portion of a class, tuition is assessed based on a ratio determined by the dean of administrative and financial services. Auditing fees are not covered under the Atrium Health Educational Loan Forgiveness program or other financial aid programs.64 2020-2021 CATALOG & STUDENT HANDBOOK \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSExpectations of auditors are determined by the course faculty. Typically, the auditor is expected to attend class regularly and may or may not be expected to complete assignments. If the expectations are not achieved the course will not be considered audited. No credit is awarded for an audited class. Student Action Plans Student action plans are intended to increase the likelihood that students will succeed in meeting course and/ or program learning outcomes and comply with established academic and conduct standards by providing clear expectations, suggestions and the opportunity for improvement. A student action plan can be initiated for any of the following: Academic action plans: 1. The student is not progressing toward achievement of one or more learning objectives. 2. The student is likely to benefit from enhanced or remedial learning activities to meet one or more learning objectives. 3. The student has failed to meet one or more clinical learning objectives. Administrative action plans: The student demonstrates behaviors (or lack thereof) that violate the student code of conduct or honor code. Student action plans can be initiated by faculty or college administrators at any time during a student's enrollment. Action plans include a description of the area of deficiency and/or policy violation, specific goal(s) for improvement, a timetable for corrective action to take place and a discussion of potential consequences for failing to meet the criteria of the plan (e.g., failure of a course, academic probation, recommendation for dismissal from the program). Withdrawal A number of factors may lead to the decision to withdraw from a program or a course, including difficulty making satisfactory academic progress in the course and/or for excessive absenteeism. Students should consult with their advisor or program chair prior to withdrawing to ensure full awareness of the consequences. A refund calculation and a withdrawal form will be completed by or for all exiting students. Withdrawal from a course: Students may add and drop classes at their discretion during the first week of classes. After the first week of class, students must withdraw from a course. Students withdrawing from a course after the first week of class or those withdrawing from their last class must obtain their advisor's signature before submitting the form to the director of student records and information management. A grade of \"W\" (Withdrawal) is used when a student withdraws from a course when the last date of attendance occurs up to 75% of the course. The deadline for non-punitive withdrawals (75% of the term) will be published in the registration bulletin each term. Student absence from class does not constitute an official withdrawal, thus failure to withdraw by the established deadline will result in a final grade of \"F.\" When a student withdraws from a course, access to course materials will be terminated. Withdrawal from the Program/College: Failure to enroll in courses in alignment with the master curriculum without prior approval of the program chair will be considered an unsuccessful attempt in the master curriculum and will be considered withdrawn from the program and/or the College. Students withdrawing from the program/college must complete the withdrawal form and obtain the signature of the program chair before submitting the form to the director of student records and information management. Students withdrawing from a healthcare program are eligible to remain in any general studies courses in which they are enrolled. If the student does not choose to do so, the withdrawal will be considered a complete withdrawal from the College. Students who withdraw from the program/college become ineligible for student benefits as of the date of withdrawal and may have to surrender their student ID badge. CAROLINAS COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES 65 \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSLeave of Absence/Withdrawal: Students may apply for a leave of absence when critical factors beyond the student's control make successful course completion impossible or unlikely. Factors may include extended illness, jury duty, military activation, bereavement (spouse, parent, child) or other extenuating circumstances restricting student attendance and successful completion of courses. If the request is for less than one term and the student is not in academic difficulty (not in progression, on probation, or on an action plan) and there is no resulting grading consequence (i.e., an Incomplete grade), the dean of student affairs and enrollment management, in consultation with the program chair can approve or deny the leave request. If the request is for one semester or more, the student is in academic difficulty, or there is a potential grading consequence for the LOA, the Academic, Progression and Graduation (APG) committee will review the information/documentation provided in support of the request and approve or deny the leave request. Students may request a leave of absence/withdrawal at any point during their enrollment but may not exceed a total of 12 months per program enrollment. Leave of absence status ensures the student a place in the program if he/she meets all conditions set forth and returns at the agreed upon date. Changes that occur in the curriculum, college policies, or the Atrium Health Loan program will be binding upon the student returning from a LOA/W. Students returning to a clinically-based healthcare program must reenter no later than one year from the end of the last successfully completed applied course. If a student involved in an alleged academic integrity violation or facing other disciplinary issues withdraws from a course, program or the College prior to resolution, continuation of the disciplinary process is determined by the dean of student affairs and provost. If a hearing is not pursued upon the withdrawal of the student, the dean of student affairs and provost can reinitiate the disciplinary process prior to future readmission or progression. In either case, any disciplinary processes or actions will follow normal due process procedures for the offense. Satisfactory Academic Progress Satisfactory academic progress consists of two elements: qualitative, as demonstrated by course grades, and quantitative, as demonstrated by credit hours earned as a percentage of credit hours attempted. A cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of 2.0 (\"C\") is the minimal measure of academic satisfactory progress toward graduation. Grades earned in courses taken elsewhere are not calculated in the Carolinas College CGPA, even when advanced standing credit is granted. In addition, beginning at the end of a student's second term of enrollment and thereafter, students must successfully complete 50% of the cumulative hours attempted. A grade of A, B or C demonstrates successful completion of a course; a grade of I, W, WF, D or F is not considered successful completion. Transfer credit does count in the calculation of the quantitative measure of satisfactory academic progress. At the completion of a term, the director of student records and information management will assure that a new GPA and CGPA have been calculated and appear on the student transcript. A student whose CGPA is below 2.0 or who has not completed 50% of attempted credit hours (upon completion of the second term of enrollment and thereafter) will be placed on academic probation for the subsequent term attended. 1. The dean of student affairs and enrollment management will send a letter alerting the student to his/her probationary status, including sources of academic assistance and consequences of failure to improve. The program chair will also be notified. 2. The grade earned in a class that is retaken replaces the original grade in the calculation of the GPA and CGPA, but both grades are maintained on the transcript. Separate policies govern CGPA for guaranteed readmission purposes. At the conclusion of the probationary period, the new CGPA is expected to be at or above 2.0 and at least 50% of all attempted credit hours are to have been successfully earned (effective for credit hours attempted after the second term of enrollment and thereafter). If not, the student will generally be academically dismissed. However, if the CGPA is still below a 2.0 but the term GPA is 3.0 or higher, the student may be allowed one additional and final term to demonstrate ability to be successful. This \"second probation\" period must culminate in a CGPA of 2.0 or better, or the student will be academically dismissed. A student placed on second (or extended) probation will be notified in writing of his/her status. No student will be permitted to register for class if reaching a 2.0 CGPA within two terms of notification is not mathematically possible.66 2020-2021 CATALOG & STUDENT HANDBOOK \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSAcademic Progression and Dismissal For all programs, the lowest passing letter grade in any course is a \"C.\" Students in the general studies and RN-BSN programs will follow the Academic Satisfactory Progress policy and will not be subject to dismissal based on the grade in one course. Please refer to the Satisfactory Academic Progress section above. Students in the ADN nursing program will follow the Progression policy and are not subject to dismissal based on the grade in one course. If the course is a prerequisite, that course must be repeated before the student progresses. Repeating a course is based on space availability. For more details on the ADN progression process, please see the Progression policy and the section on progression in the ADN Nursing section of this catalog. Notification of academic dismissal by the provost will occur when: 1. General Studies and RN-BSN students fail to meet standards of academic satisfactory progress as outlined in the policy by the same name. 2. Students in the ADN program have a subsequent (second) failure fail to meet required co-requisites or pre-requisites. 3. Students in the Histotechnology, Medical Laboratory Science, Neurodiagnostic Technology, Radiation Therapy, and Radiologic Technology programs earn a grade lower than a \"C\" in a master curriculum course. A student who is dismissed from a clinical program can continue to take general studies courses and complete the associate degree in General Studies program. Readmission to Credit Programs A student who is academically dismissed from a program can petition for readmission with the exception of students in the ADN program who have completed the same course twice. A student applying for readmission must reenter no later than one year from the last successfully completed applied course. Applied courses (i.e., NUR, etc.) must be repeated if the length of time between successful completion of a course and readmission to a consecutive course exceeds one calendar year or if substantial curriculum changes have occurred. Petitions for readmission must be submitted to the dean of student affairs. All readmission petitions are deliberated by the APG Committee, including a hearing with the student. For more information, please see the Readmission to Credit Programs and Conducting APG Hearings policies. Student Academic Records The student file maintained by the director of student records and information management is considered the primary student academic record. In accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974, as amended, students may review their academic records and prevent disclosure of certain information. The record may be released to a third party only with the written consent of the student or parent of a dependent student, as defined by the Internal Revenue Service, or in certain situations allowed by federal law including public safety concerns, court subpoenas, regulatory, accreditation or federal agency requests, legitimate educational interests or other exceptions. For the purpose of student records, the term \"student\" includes all matriculating individuals 18 years of age or older. Any student 17 years of age or younger, or any dependent student whose parent requests access, will be notified of such a request in writing. All requests will be recorded in the student's file. The director of student records and information management will discuss with interested students the procedure for requesting a review of the academic file. Student files are kept in locked, fire-proof areas with limited access. Staff granted access are trained regarding the policies governing the handling and storage of student records. Directory information including name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, photograph, dates of attendance, degrees, honors and awards received, and participation in college activities may be disclosed without the consent of the student. Students may request nondisclosure of directory information by completing a form available from the director CAROLINAS COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES 67 \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSof student records and information management. Requests for nondisclosure are valid for one year. In response to an authenticated electronic or signed student request, an official transcript will be issued to the designated institution or person provided financial obligations to the College have been met. A fee will be charged for each official copy. Transcripts on file from other institutions are not released. To assure proper record keeping, students are required to update their address and contact information in the student information system. Name changes require legal documentation and must be submitted to the director of student records and information management. Alumni are encouraged to keep the College informed of their current name, contact information and professional status. Dean's List, President's List and Academic Awards Students in for-credit healthcare programs and those in the pre-nursing or pre-radiologic technology tracks or general studies courses (6 or more credit hours) receiving a grade point average of 3.50 - 3.99 for a term will be placed on the Dean's List. Certificate will be awarded. Students in for-credit healthcare programs and those in the pre-nursing or pre-radiologic technology tracks or general studies courses (6 or more credit hours) receiving a grade point average of 4.00 for a term will be placed on the President's List. Certificate will be awarded. Students achieving an overall GPA of 3.24 or higher will be recognized at the commencement exercise as graduating with Latin honors of: Cum scholastic, leadership and performance-based awards may be presented as determined by the faculty and/or the program chairs. Graduation Requirements Graduation ceremonies are listed on the academic calendar. All students receiving degrees, diplomas or certificates (excluding non-credit programs) are required to submit an application for graduation by the designated deadline and expected to attend the graduation exercises. Enrolled students who have maintained the highest scholastic averages are honored by being named graduation marshals. Programs that graduate students during off-cycle times may have a graduation recognition event in place of a ceremony. Upon request, these students may participate in the next scheduled ceremony. Satisfactory completion of all required and elective courses in the designated master curriculum is required for graduation and to earn a degree, diploma or certificate. The satisfactory completion of the requirements will be calculated by the director of student records and information management and reviewed by the APG committee. The student must have attained a grade of \"C\" or better in each of the curriculum requirements and have a 2.0 or higher cumulative grade point average (GPA); earned a minimum of 25 percent of the required credit hours at Carolinas College and satisfied all financial obligations to the College. Additional graduation requirements for specific programs can be found in the program-specific sections of the catalog.68 2020-2021 CATALOG & STUDENT HANDBOOK \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTS Clinical Laboratory Sciences: Histotechnology Program Mission and Overview In support of the mission of the College, the mission of the Histotechnology program is to transform lives by educating, engaging and empowering professionals enabling them to function as competent entry-level medical laboratory scientists and serve in leadership, educational and technical roles within the profession.

Typical hours of instruction are Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Clinical rotations vary and may include early morning and second shift hours. Attendance Promptness and attendance are expected. Punctuality is very important, and notification of absences or tardiness is mandatory. Students are required to be on time for class and attend lectures, student labs and clinical assignments. Students may jeopardize their ability to successfully pass a course if they are not present and on time for class and clinical rotations. Faculty members keep an official attendance record in each course. The following are additional guidelines with respect to time and attendance: Make-up work/time for assignments missed is the responsibility of the student and at the discretion of the education coordinator. Students must notify the course faculty member, and when applicable the clinical preceptor, at least one hour prior to the course or clinical start time for any absence or tardiness. If a student is absent without proper notification more than one time, the student may be recommended for dismissal from the program. Attendance and punctuality are documented and incorporated in the student's affective grade in each course and may be included on any future job references the education coordinator or program chair writes for the student. Students are responsible for communicating daily with the education coordinator to accurately record their time during clinical rotation. CAROLINAS COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES 71 \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSGrading Policy The histotechnology program uses the following numerical grade ranges for the final letter grade of each course: A: 94 - 100 B: 87 - 93 C: 80 - 86 D: 73 - 79 Deficient, non-passing F: below 73 Failing, non-passing Students must maintain a \"C\" average or above in each course. Any student who has an average below 80 at midpoint of the course will be required to develop an action plan in conjunction with the education coordinator and/or program chair. Academic support is available through the Student Success Center. Faculty members or the program chair can refer students experiencing difficulty to the Student Success Center for assistance. Failure to achieve a course average of 80 or above by the end of the course will result in course failure and academic dismissal from the program. Psychomotor and affective evaluations constitute a percentage of the student's cumulative grade in each course. Any student who has a consistent problem meeting the psychomotor or affective objectives will be placed on an action plan and if the unacceptable behavior or attitude persists, the student may be recommended for dismissal from the program. The College APG committee will consider any persistent academic performance issues referred by the faculty. Certification of Completion Graduates of the program receive a certificate in Histotechnology and are eligible to take the Histotechnology (HTL) American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) Board of Certification examination to become nationally certified.

Clinical/Lab Attendance Clinical/lab experiences are provided each term to allow students the opportunity to correlate theory with the actual performance of radiologic imaging procedures. Students are expected to attend all scheduled assignments and are required to attend a minimum number of hours of clinical and lab each term as specified in the syllabus. The clinical coordinator or course faculty may make exceptions in extreme circumstances.90 2020-2021 CATALOG & STUDENT HANDBOOK \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSNotification of clinical absences or tardiness is mandatory. The clinical area or instructor must be notified by phone at least one-half hour in advance of an absence. Leaving prior to the end of clinical schedule or missing labs counts as absent time. Clinical Assignments/Preparation The clinical schedule/rotation is posted for each course. Specific assignments to clinical areas/sites are made to provide the student with a variety of experiences in a variety of settings. Students receive a clinical notebook prior to each course with specific guidelines outlining the clinical requirements and objectives for the term. Students are expected to prepare for clinical assignments. Students are responsible for maintaining proficiency in all imaging procedures and clinical skills previously taught. Periodic evaluation by the clinical instructor will ensure the student is maintaining the necessary clinical skills. A student who does not maintain clinical competency may be removed from the clinical environment and receive an unsatisfactory clinical rating. Clinical/ didactic assignments may be scheduled Monday through Friday between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. Competency Evaluation/Skills For the student to be successful in the clinical setting, competency evaluation is required for specific imaging procedures and skills. There are core clinical competencies that all students must demonstrate to establish eligibility for graduation and ARRT certification. Competency/skills requirements are identified in the clinical notebook. Students must demonstrate competence in all 37 mandatory radiologic procedures and 15 of the 34 elective procedures. All procedures should be performed on patients, but up to 8 of the 37 mandatory procedures may be simulated if competency demonstration on patients is not feasible. Elective procedures should be performed on patients, but simulated demonstration is permissible if demonstration on a patient is not possible or feasible. Students must be CPR certified and demonstrate competency in general patient care activities. All competency demonstrations, patient care skills and clinical education will be performed under the direct supervision of a registered radiologic technologist. To ensure that each student is actively participating in radiographic examinations and obtaining educational experience beyond the core competencies, the student is required to obtain a minimum number of competencies each term to receive a satisfactory clinical score. The following student behaviors are necessary to be considered competent in an imaging procedure or skill: Clearly demonstrate an understanding of the principles and rationale for performing the radiologic imaging procedure or skill. Competently demonstrate how the radiologic imaging procedure or skill is performed within a specified time frame. While performing the radiologic imaging procedure or skill, identify patient care responsibilities such as communication, safety and legal and ethical issues. Clearly demonstrate radiation safety principles in all assigned tasks and rotations. Clinical Evaluation Clinical conferences are scheduled periodically throughout the term. The purpose of the conference is to assist the student in synthesizing information presented in lecture, lab and clinical. Self-evaluation by the student is required. A Clinical Rotation Summary form is a tool used by the faculty and student to appraise the student's performance. Each student will receive feedback, verbally and in writing throughout the term. The clinical conference serves as a means for documenting strengths, weaknesses and progress of the student in meeting the clinical requirements and objectives. If the student is having difficulty or is unsatisfactory at any time, the faculty member and the student will develop an action plan. The action plan constitutes a contract for improvement. By the end of the course, each student must achieve a satisfactory in the clinical component in order to progress. Satisfactory is defined as consistently demonstrating the identified behaviors in all components of the objectives. Following the evaluation conference, CAROLINAS COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES 91 \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSthe clinical summary form is signed by the student and faculty member. Signature of the student indicates that he/she has read the summary; it does not necessarily indicate agreement. The student has the option of writing additional comments. Supervision During Clinical Assignments All medical imaging procedures will be performed under the direct supervision of a qualified/registered radiographer until the student has achieved competency. Direct supervision means that a qualified/ registered radiographer: Reviews the procedure in relation to the student's achievement. Evaluates the condition of the patient in relation to the student's knowledge. Is present during the conduct of the procedure. Reviews and approves the procedure. Medical imaging procedures are performed under indirect supervision after a student has demonstrated competency. Indirect supervision means that supervision is provided by a qualified/registered radiographer immediately available to assist the student regardless of the level of student achievement. \"Immediately available\" is interpreted as the presence of a qualified/registered radiographer adjacent to the room or location where a radiologic procedure is being performed. This availability applies to all areas where ionizing radiation equipment is in use. The student-to-radiographer ratio must be 1:1. A staff radiographer may not supervise more than one student during any imaging procedure. It is acceptable for more than one student to be temporarily assigned to a registered staff radiographer during the performance of uncommon procedures such as (but not limited to) TMJ's, Mastoids, etc. Level I and Level II students will be directly supervised for all bedside radiography and all radiographic procedures performed in a surgical environment (OR) regardless of the skill/competency level of the student. Repeat Radiographs Students in the Radiologic Technology Program are required to abide by all radiation safety rules, regulations and precautions. It is imperative that all efforts should be made to avoid repeat radiographs. The goal of all radiography students under the supervision of registered radiographers is to obtain a high-quality diagnostic image with as low a radiation dose to the patient as possible. This is in keeping with the ALARA Principle of As Low As Reasonably Achievable. Unsatisfactory radiographs may only be repeated in the presence of a qualified/registered radiographer regardless of the level of the student's competency achievement. A student who repeats an unsatisfactory radiograph other than in the presence of a qualified/registered radiographer will be given a written reprimand and be required to meet with the school faculty to determine further action(s). The program faculty will provide quarterly dosimetry radiation badge reports to each student. Students are required to review the quarterly monitoring report and acknowledge receipt by signing the appropriate form. Radiation Safety Maximum radiation protection will be provided to each radiology student according to the clinical agency's radiation safety policies. This will include a radiation monitoring badge, class and lab education sessions, direct supervision in clinical rotations, clinical site orientations and additional measures stated in the radiation safety policies. All students are required to wear radiation monitors for clinical and laboratory assignments.92 2020-2021 CATALOG & STUDENT HANDBOOK \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSStudent Pregnancy Policy If a student becomes pregnant while enrolled in the program, they should note that declarations of pregnancy: Are voluntary and optional. Must be made in writing when disclosed. Will be kept in strict confidence. May be withdrawn in writing at any time without explanation. If notice of voluntary disclosure of a potential pregnancy is presented to the program, the program chair will immediately arrange a counseling session with the Atrium Health Radiation Safety Officer for: Discussion of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NCR's) regulations on radiation protection.

CAROLINAS COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES 101 \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTS Nursing: Associate Degree Program Mission and Overview In support of the College mission, the Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) program prepares graduates to practice at entry level according to the core components as outlined by the National League for Nursing, in a variety of healthcare settings. The core components and competencies include: human flourishing, nursing judgment, professional identity and the spirit of inquiry. Additionally, the ADN program adheres to the core values adopted by Atrium Health of caring, commitment, integrity and teamwork. Philosophy We, the faculty, believe that: Nursing is a caring profession that uses a holistic approach to promote optimal health for diverse individuals and their families and communities. A scientific process of assessment, planning, intervention and evaluation of outcomes is used to implement nursing care. Nursing is a scholarly profession with its own body of scientific knowledge supported and communicated through research and informatics. Nursing draws support from the liberal arts and life sciences to develop critical thinking and promote evidence-based practice. Nursing is an art as well as a science. It is an interactive, interpersonal process which finds expression through actions intended to promote human flourishing. Caring represents a gift of self, based on sound nursing judgment and intuitive awareness of the patient's needs. Nursing is founded on the belief that everyone deserves unconditional positive regard. Nursing practice occurs in a variety of settings and is a collaborative, interprofessional process. Nurses assume a professional identity and practice within a professional code of ethics and established standards of care. A solid foundation of knowledge, skills and attitudes supports the delivery of safe, effective care to culturally diverse patients, groups and families. Nurses advocate for patients and their support systems. Nurses are accountable to themselves, the patient, the community and society. Nursing education is a continuous lifelong process. We believe the learning process is facilitated when it progresses from simple to complex and concrete to abstract. Learning is goal-directed, building upon previous knowledge with concurrent application. Successful learners demonstrate a spirit of inquiry and challenge the status quo. Nursing education promotes information literacy, self-direction, problem-solving and accountability. Faculty and students are equal partners in the educational process based on trust, support, caring and respect. 102 2020-2021 CATALOG & STUDENT HANDBOOK \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSThe Carolinas College of Health Sciences associate degree program prepares individuals to contribute to society and the profession of nursing while encouraging matriculation into baccalaureate nursing programs. The faculty recognizes that each student learns differently and accepts the challenge of creating a learning environment conducive to those individual needs. The faculty serves as educators, facilitators, mentors, consultants, role models and colleagues to students as well as the community. Organizing Framework and Student Learning Outcomes The philosophy of the ADN program faculty shapes the curriculum. The core components and competencies identified by the National League for Nursing are major elements of the curriculum's organizing structure. The organizing framework contains the following core components and competencies: Human flourishing Nursing judgment Professional identity Spirit of inquiry The program student learning outcomes for the ADN program align with the established organizing framework for the curriculum. Upon completion of the ADN program, graduates will be able to: Advocate for patients and families in ways that promote their self-determination, integrity, and ongoing growth as human beings. Make judgments in practice, substantiated with evidence, that integrate nursing science in the provision of safe, quality care, and promote the health of patients within a family and community context. Implement one's role as a nurse in ways that reflect integrity, responsibility, ethical practices, and an evolving identity as a nurse committed to evidence-based practice, caring, advocacy, and safe, quality care for diverse patients within a family and community context. Examine the evidence that underlies clinical nursing practice to challenge the status quo, question underlying assumptions, and offer new insights to improve the quality of care for patients, families, and communities.

Clinical Assignments/Preparations The clinical schedule/rotation will be posted for each course. Specific assignments to groups are made to provide the student a variety of experiences in a variety of settings. Clinical assignments will be posted using only a patient's initials in order to ensure privacy. Students are expected to prepare for clinical assignments as instructed by faculty. Students who are not properly prepared will not be permitted to remain in the clinical area. During pre-conference, the student will be expected to verbally relate essential information about his/her assigned patient to the clinical group. Post-conference activities will be determined by group needs and conducted at the discretion of the clinical instructor. The purpose of the post-conference is to assist the student in synthesizing information presented in class, clinical and skills lab. Competency Guidelines In order for the student to be successful in performing skills in the clinical setting, demonstration of skills in the simulated nursing skills lab is required for specified skills. Each course identifies the specific skills in the syllabus. The following student behaviors are necessary for skill verification: Clearly demonstrate an understanding of the principles and rationale related to the skill; Demonstrate how the skill is performed within a specified time frame, and While performing the skill, identify nursing responsibilities for the patient. Any skill that has been previously validated may be reevaluated for students who are not attending class before the student can return to the clinical setting. Additional remediation may be required for some skills. Clinical Evaluation A clinical evaluation tool is designed for each course and is used by the faculty and student to appraise the student's performance. Each student will receive weekly feedback, verbally and/or in writing. Self-evaluation by students is required. The clinical evaluation tool serves as a means for documenting strengths, weaknesses and progress of the student in meeting the clinical student learning outcomes. If the student is having difficulty or is unsatisfactory at any time, the faculty member and the student may develop an action plan. The action plan constitutes a contract for improvement. By the end of the course, each student must achieve a satisfactory in the clinical component of the course to be successful and progress. Satisfactory is defined as the consistent demonstration of expected role competencies in each student learning outcome. Following the evaluation conference, the clinical evaluation tool is signed by the student and faculty member. Signature of the student indicates that he/she has read the tool; it does not necessarily indicate agreement. The student has the option of writing additional comments.

Total Testing The ADN program utilizes a total testing program to enhance the students' educational process. The testing program is used to: decrease attrition rates, encourage critical-thinking and use of nursing process, increase performance on the NCLEX-RN and validate the nursing curriculum against national norms. The testing program provides numerous practice tests for students to utilize as review and in preparing for these tests. Students are required to take a Comprehensive Assessment Profile (CAP) test at the end of most courses. To successfully complete the CAP test requirement of a course the student will have one opportunity to take CAP test(s) associated with the course in which they are enrolled. Proficiency in the content will be determined by levels described in the syllabus and will comprise 5% of the course grade. ADN Program Progression Students who are unsuccessful in a nursing master curriculum course can progress to the next course based on co-requisite requirements, space availability and faculty approval. Specific information for each level of nursing is indicated below: A student who is unsuccessful in NUR 110 or any required co-requisite course may not progress in the nursing curriculum until that course is successfully repeated, but may remain enrolled as a general studies student or may repeat the problematic class at the first available offering in which space is available. A student who is unsuccessful in an intermediate nursing course or a co-requisite class may automatically progress to the next course depending upon placement, space availability and course offerings. Students beginning the ADN program in spring 2020 will be required to successfully pass each nursing course in sequence prior to progressing. Nursing students who are unsuccessful in a general studies course may not progress if the course is a prerequisite for a course in the subsequent term. General studies courses are expected to be taken as prescribed in the nursing master curriculum plan. A student who transfers into the nursing program is ineligible for progression if they had been unsuccessful in a nursing course in their previous program. All students must attend a professional organization meeting in order to progress into NUR 202, effective through spring 2021 term. A student who is unsuccessful in NUR 202, and it is their first unsuccessful course attempt, may repeat the class at its next offering, provided space is available. In all instances above the program chair will contact the student to discuss the process for requesting progression. The program chair will notify the student of his/her eligibility to progress and request completion of the Petition for Progression - Student Form. Completion of the Petition for Progression will require a success plan for improvement. Students that fail to submit the Petition for Progression Form by the established deadline will be automatically deferred to the next term. Students who complete this form, and are offered a space in a course, may delay progression by no more than one nursing course. An additional voluntary waiver of progression results in program withdrawal. The nursing faculty and program chair will determine if the student is allowed to return to the next available class or if additional remedial time is needed prior to progressing. Students unsuccessful in two courses in the nursing master curriculum plan will be dismissed from the program with the option of applying for readmission. Two unsuccessful attempts of the same course will result in dismissal with no option to reapply. 106 2020-2021 CATALOG & STUDENT HANDBOOK \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTS Any subsequent unsuccessful attempts after readmission will result in immediate dismissal with no option to reapply. Any skill that has been previously validated may require reevaluation before the student can return to the clinical setting. Additional remediation may be required for some skills. Students who have an outstanding financial obligation to the College will not be allowed to progress. The Progression policy does not apply to students who have been administratively dismissed. Nurse Aide II Certification Students successfully completing NUR 110 and NUR 120 and demonstrating successful verification of the listed skills may be eligible to apply to the NC Board of Nursing for listing as a Nurse Aide II.

CAROLINAS COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES 107 \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTS Nursing: Bachelor of Science Program Mission and Overview The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (RN-BSN) program is designed for graduates from an accredited associate or diploma degree program who want to advance professionally by completing a BSN degree. In support of the College mission, the RN-BSN program adds to previous education and practice experiences and prepares graduates for professional nursing practice as a baccalaureate generalist according to the following essentials of education outlined by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing [AACN (2008)]: 1. Liberal education for baccalaureate generalist nursing practice. 2. Basic organizational and systems leadership for quality care and patient safety. 3. Scholarship for evidence-based practice. 4. Information management and application of patient care technology. 5. Health care policy, finance and regulatory environments. 6. Interprofessional communication and collaboration for improving patient health outcomes. 7. Clinical prevention and population health. 8. Professionalism and professional values. 9. Baccalaureate generalist nursing practice. Additionally, the RN-BSN program adheres to Atrium Health's core values of caring, commitment, integrity, and teamwork. Philosophy We, the faculty, believe BSN-prepared nurses deliver safe, evidence-based care within complex healthcare environments. As healthcare services and environments rapidly evolve, nurses are expected to assume a variety of roles, coordinate care, work in interprofessional teams and support the nursing profession. Caring encompasses the foundation of professional nursing and the systematic process utilized to devise the goals of nursing actions. Additionally, professional nursing practice extends across the lifespan of human beings to include individuals, families, aggregates, communities and populations. Humans are complex, open systems who are integral with their environments. The faculty believe that nursing is concerned with human interactions within their environments and its influence on health. Therefore, BSN nursing education at Carolinas College, with the support of Atrium Health, prepares learners for professional practice to serve the people of the greater Charlotte region and beyond.108 2020-2021 CATALOG & STUDENT HANDBOOK \u00abTABLE OF CONTENTSThe professional nurse is continuously applying clinical reasoning and critical-thinking competencies to practice. As nursing knowledge transforms into wisdom, the BSN nurse utilizes informatics, science, liberal arts and leadership to not only improve care outcomes but to promote wellness, prevention and rehabilitation. The baccalaureate generalist continuously evaluates his or her lifelong learning goals to seek opportunities for growth, currency and professional development. The faculty at Carolinas College guide, design and coordinate the BSN experience to successfully meet the needs of students by implementing integrative strategies for learning. Learners have a varied set of cognitive, psychological, social and cultural characteristics that require faculty to meet diverse learning needs and styles. Learning and education objectives are focused on the professional practice and roles of the baccalaureate generalist nurse.
