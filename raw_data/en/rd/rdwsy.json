Ayurvedic medicine encompasses the physical, psychological, and spiritual dimensions of life by taking into consideration of dynamic concepts of wellness, prevention, and management of diseases. This holistic approach to healing that evolved from these origins relies on natural remedies\u2014including medicinal plants and minerals, exercise/yoga, lifestyle modifications, diet modifications and bodywork and detoxification therapies\u2014to optimize health and manage the diseases. Ayurveda strongly advocates the pursuit of physical, mental and spiritual well-being through self-discipline and strict adherence to a code of good conduct and to proper diet, exercise, and daily living routines Ayurveda, as a system of health care and medicine, reflects time-tested knowledge of health and illness during a human life span for leading a healthy, happy, and peaceful life. It is still widely used in India as a system of primary health care and interest in it is growing globally. This traditional medical science explains the prevention and health promotion and treatment of diseases. Scientific studies on health promotive methods as well as disease management through Ayurveda have shown that Ayurvedic medicine is effective, and this may lead to wider use of Ayurvedic treatments in the future. Literature documentation shows that this science is practiced for 5,000 years indicating the effectiveness of this time-tested medicine for treating various disorders and bringing optimum health. Research is the prime need for the development of Ayurveda globally. Research in Ayurveda is slowly growing and the potential of Ayurvedic medicine needs to be explored further with modern scientific validation approaches to evaluate the effectiveness and efficacy of these interventions. Over the last few decades, there are many high qualities research studies conducted in Ayurveda giving promising results. Ayurveda is a traditional healthcare system of Indian medicine since ancient times. Ayurvedic medicine is considered integral to India's health system along with conventional health care. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, Ayurvedic medicine is considered as one of the world's oldest medical systems. The World Health Organization recognizes Ayurveda as one of the traditional health care systems and took the initiative in developing a benchmark for teaching Ayurvedic Medicine globally and formulating policies and regulations on these traditional health care practices for the promotion of Ayurveda. At present, there is a lack of scientific validation in various concepts explained in Ayurveda. Hence, evidence-based research is highly needed for global recognition and acceptance of Ayurveda, which needs further advancements in the research methodology in Ayurveda. At present, if you do a search for Ayurveda on [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), hundreds of clinical research studies in Ayurveda are accessible. PubMed is a service of the National Library of Medicine that contains publication information and brief summaries of articles from scientific and medical journals. It is a free resource supporting the search and retrieval of biomedical and life sciences literature with the aim of improving health-both globally and personally. For guidance on using PubMed, see [How To Find Information About Complementary Health Approaches on PubMed](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/how-to-find-information-about-complementary-health-approaches-on-pubmed), from the National Institutes of Health.
