Before the late 1980s and early 1990s, these children were diagnosed as retarded or having developmental delay, lead author William Barbaresi, a developmental paediatrician, told the BMJ . The prevalence of autism increased more than eightfold in the United States, from 5.5 (95% confidence interval 1.4 to 9.5) per 100 000 children in 1980-3 to 44.9 (32.9 to 56.9) per 100 000 in ...", "sitename": "The BMJ", "date": "2005-01-13", "cleaned_text": "Increase in autism due to change in definition, not MMR vaccineBMJ 2005; 330 doi: [https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.330.7483.112-d](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.330.7483.112-d)(Published 13 January 2005) Cite this as: BMJ 2005;330:112 All rapid responses Rapid responses are electronic comments to the editor.

That is possibly true but are you as a physician prepared to state catagorically that a childs immune system is fully mature at the age of the first dose of MMR and completely able to cope with an ingrediant such as Mercury which the MMR until recently included? I may have a simplistic approach to my responses here on the BMJ and that is maybe because I am a mother and not trained as a medical professional. It maybe that I use common sense to form my opinions something which I see totally evades the present government and the current health system. It may of course be the fact that I have had to deal with a child who not only has Asperger Sydrome but also has had to endure feeding tubes, night feeds and disturbed sleep due to leaks and kinks in the tube.A child who has been screaming in agony with stomach pains and diarrhoea. Possibly its remembering the hours I spent in the supermarket on a shop that should take twenty minutes due to comlicated special diets checking ingrediants. Then again maybe its just the pain of my sons frustration at not understanding why he does not fit and why others tease him.I think my views are not so much simplistic as they are realistic. As John P Heptonstall so aptly says :- 'All vaccinators are aware that vaccinations can cause serious injury, they do not necesarily know who will succumb when their 'gun'is fired into the crowd but are prepared to kill and maim members of that crowd.' Our children are are the members of that crowd, our children are the ones that gun maimed and killed.How many more children must suffer before the true damage of this combination vaccine is realised???? Competing interests: The mother of two Autistic children one MMR vaccine damaged Competing interests: No competing interests John Stone has called me to task on a number of points. There is no inconsistency in my position that autism might be precipitated by vaccination with MMR. Stone states: \"if you admit that it can happen then how do you come to pre-conceived view it only happens rarely? There is nothing inherently implausible about such events being common.\" The reason for my saying it is rare is because many large-scale epidemiological studies have failed to find any statistically significant link. Stone and others may take issue with the findings of these studies, and I am well aware of their criticisms. At the same time, however, I wonder if he is not letting his own preconceptions affect his judgement. \"Unscientific bias\" occurs when the same standards are not universally applied. Stone arrives at differing conclusions to myself concerning the results of some of these studies; it is clear that anything supportive to his view is uncritically acclaimed yet anything contrary is ignored or viewed with an extremely jaundiced eye. One only has to see his interpretation of the Smeeth article (1) which concluded \"Much of the increase [in autism and other PDDs] may be due to better ascertainment related to changes in diagnostic practice and improved recognition of the conditions.\", only for Stone to claim that this paper indicated the rise was due to MMR. We have already covered this ground (2). In his post of 4th February (\"The emperor has no clothes\") Stone uses the data from a Finnish study on autism incidence to imply that MMR is responsible for the rise in incidence of autism. This study by Kielinen (3) had nothing whatsoever to do with or say about the effect of MMR. The authors state: \"Recent research reports show that autistic spectrum disorders may actually be more common than previously believed. General awareness and clinical knowledge of these disorders have increased, and the criteria in the ICD-10 and the DSM-IV are also now more detailed. The diagnostic criteria and the methods of ascertainment influence the prevalence.\" I am not surprised Stone left this part of the study unquoted, since it indicates what the Smeeth study also did, namely that increased awareness and more specific and detailed diagnostic criteria are partly responsible for the rise in autism (1). To what extent we will probably never accurately know - it might be feasible to recode autism diagnoses using the old criteria to negate this source of error, but we cannot compensate for lower awareness and therefore recognition of autism in the past. Stone puts his own spin on the findings from these studies, yet accuses me of unscientific bias. Stone might wish to look at another Finnish autism study by Kielinen using the same catchment population (4). He looked in detail at all the recorded autism cases in under 16-year-olds. In 187 cases of autism among 15732 children, he found autism-related genetic disorders in 23 (12.3%) and other related medical conditions (such as hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy) in 56 (30%). It is clear that a significant minority of autism is due to an underlying medical or genetic problem, and therefore cannot possibly be due to MMR, other vaccines, thiomersal, maternal mercury amalgam fillings or whatever else is the current flavour of the month. Would John Stone like to indicate in his opinion how much ASD is due to MMR? Is it 50%, or 10%? How much is due to other vaccines? How much is due to naturally acquired infections? Neither he (nor anyone else I suspect) knows exactly, which is why we need more answers and more research. It is easy and tempting to finger MMR as the culprit, yet extensive epidemiological studies have addressed this issue and have not suggested any link. If MMR can cause problems, its effects are statistically inapparent and it is being swallowed up in the background noise. Even if for the sake of argument we assumed that MMR causes all cases of ASD (an unlikely scenario), simple arithmetic indicates that you are about twice as likely to die when you get measles than you are to get ASD from vaccination (reported measles deaths 20 per ten thousand cases vs ASD rate of 12 per 10 thousand), never mind the other complications that measles can cause. If Stone feels that autism post MMR is common, then he has to admit to the reality that death or disability following measles is even more common. The choice is often presented by the anti-vaccine lobby as: \"Which would you rather your child have, measles or autism?\". This is a deliberate misrepresentation of the choice, as would be the logical alternative: \"Which would you rather your child have, vaccination or death?\" Stone is correct about Hilary Butler's data/sources on nutrition - they are impressive. Not having access to the texts she quotes limits my appraisal of them somewhat. A major part of her argument is that nutritional status is crucial in one's susceptibility to and ability to cope with infections. I have never doubted this. In Africa (where I worked for several years doing medicine and paediatrics) measles case fatality approaches 25% (a ten thousand percent increase over mortality rates in the west). Vitamin A was routinely given to all our cases to avert xerophthalmia and blindness. However I am still unclear as to whether Butler feels children in the UK (or New Zealand for that matter) are nutritionally disadvantaged or not. Butler's truisms about infection and malnutrition do not influence the vaccination argument, and I believe she is sidetracked by it. It is incorrect to say it is pointless immunising someone who is undernourished simply because they may respond less well to the vaccine than a completely healthy person. These are the very people who need vaccination and protection the most, since if they do become infected they are more likely to develop complications. As a corollary, I care for immunosuppressed HIV patients. Despite the fact that they respond less well to vaccines, I ensure they are fully immunised against possible infections like hepatitis B. What we usually accept as target \"protective levels\" of HBs antibody are not always attained. Nevertheless, they are still protected, and studies have demonstrated this protective effect following exposure to Hepatitis B even in those with a suboptimal response to vaccine. (1) Smeeth L et al.

I suggest he re-reads my response (8th February). Heptonstall likens vaccination to shooting a gun into a crowd, and raises the issue of criminal responsibility for side effects. All medical interventions entail some form of risk and require informed consent (and I would be the first to agree that this is often poorly obtained). There is a duty to inform the patient about common side effects, and also rare side effects if they can be serious/fatal. Vaccines in general have minor side effects, and serious side effects are extremely rare. (Clearer scientific evidence needs to be available than there is at present concerning any incidence of autism post-vaccination - currently the official line is that there is no evidence for a link so there is no obligation to discuss the issue, but in practice it is likely to be raised). The proper action would be for some form of \"no-fault compensation\" mechanism for cases where vaccine damage is proven, rather than for criminal proceedings against doctors. However, we must also look at responsibilities from another angle. If, through my inaction (rather than my action) I negligently let a patient come to harm, I would be liable (and indeed this might result in a personal criminal injury or negligence claim). Failure to protect patients from serious preventable diseases comes into this category. So perhaps you may soon see some doctors who advise against immunisation brought to book when the children become ill. Perhaps we will see cases where children sue their parents for not allowing them immunisations. I am not aware of any cases, but there are well-documented cases of parents being sued for not doing all manner of things, such as failing to put a seat belt on their child. Also look at the issue from the point of the children for whom live vaccines are contraindicated (who are also the most susceptible to the effects of the disease). These children rely on herd immunity to keep the prevalence of infection down in the community. When people decide en masse to not vaccinate their children, and a measles epidemic occurs, many of these susceptible children will suffer. Whom will they sue - the parents of the child who gave them measles (who had decided it was a good idea everyone caught natural measles and had selfishly refused to vaccinate their own child)?. Competing interests: None declared Competing interests: No competing interests It was recently reported that the infant mortality rate (IMR) in the United States increased in 2001-2002. Commenting on that report (1), Nancy S. Green, Medical Director of the March of Dimes stated on January 24, 2005: \"The infant mortality rate is an extremely important figure, as it is one of the most accurate measures of the health of society. This was the first rise in the infant mortality rate since 1958, and it may be a harbinger of worsening health conditions for America's babies. The infant mortality rate in the United States is worse than that of most other affluent nations...\" We must all share Dr. Green's deep concern about the continued increase in the number of premature births in the United States and we certainly applaud her efforts in calling for a conference on this important issue. But the increase in IMR is not only due to the increase in the number of premature and low birth weight infants and we must find out what else is causing such increase in a country spending more on health care than any other. What is even more alarming and disturbing is the fact that even when the IMR in the United States was \"decreasing\" in the last four decades, the IMR in other countries was decreasing at A FASTER RATE. (2) In 1997, Gerard Anderson, PhD, Professor of Health Policy and Management at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health (2) reported that: 1. While the infant mortality rate in the U.S. declined to 8.0 per 1,000 live births between 1990 and 1995, the US ranked 23rd out of 29 industrialized countries because other countries had shown more rapid improvement in reducing infant mortality. 2. The U.S. spent 14.2 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on health care in 1996. Germany, the next closest country, spent 10.5 percent. 3. In the same year, the U.S. spent the most per capita on health care services ($3,708 US per person). Switzerland with $2,412 (US) per person was next. In 2000, the United States had the highest IMR - 6.9 per 1000 live births - among the G7 Nations. (3) Japan had the lowest at 3.2/1000 followed by Germany (4.4/1000), Italy (4.5/1000), France (4.6/1000), Canada (5.3/1000) and the United Kingdom (5.6/1000). A listing of the estimated 2004 worldwide Infant Mortality Rates (4) has just been updated and published (January 27, 2005). Nations were listed in order of decreasing IMR. Angola, listed first (#1), had an estimated rate of 192.50 per 1000. In Singapore, listed last (#226) the IMR was the lowest in the world, with 2.28 infant deaths per 1000 live births. The United States was listed as # 185 (6.63/1000). Among nations with lower IMR were Cuba (#187), Faroe Islands (#188), Isle of Man (#190), Aruba (# 191), and Gibraltar (#199). The United Kingdom was listed as # 200 with an IMR of 5.22/1000. Among nations with lower IMR rates were Liechtenstein (#206), Slovenia (#211), Czech Republic (#218), Macau (#214) and Malta (#219). It is important that I state that professionally, my primary concern is and has always been the health and welfare of infants and children. I have had extensive training in infectious diseases and have served as the Assistant Clinical Director of a leading (US) Infectious Diseases Hospital. I am pro-reasonable vaccination, a fact that appears to upset people on both sides of the vaccination debate. In 2005, more vaccines will be administered to infants under age 1 in the United States (5) than in any other country. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics and presumably the CDC, the recommended schedule calls for 3 doses of Hepatitis B vaccine, the first at \"Birth\", 3 doses of DTAP (nine antigens), 3 doses of HIB, 3 doses of IPV, 3 doses of Prevnar (our 7-valent pneumococcal vaccine) and one dose of Influenza vaccine. It is also safe to state that in the last four decades, no other country has consistently administered more vaccines to infants and children than the United States. I am not suggesting that infants in the United States are dying at a higher rate than those in Cuba and the Faroe Islands because we are vaccinating them so much more. I am only making the simple observation that although we are spending enormous funds on health care and we are administering all these vaccines, it certainly does NOT appear that we are increasing our infants' chances to reach their first birthday. Now this does disturb me immensely. I suspect that it must disturb others also. Perhaps Bill Gates should look at the above data on one of his many computers and consider donating some of his charitable dollars to investigate whether some vaccines can affect certain children negatively. For sure, the CDC, the DOH in the United Kingdom and the vaccine manufacturers are not about to do that any time soon. Lastly, while he is still in a generous mood, Mr. Gates should consider supporting research investigating the environmental causes of regressive autism, the ONLY REAL EPIDEMIC in the United States today. Charity does begin at home. References 1. [http://search.marchofdimes.com/cgi-](http://search.marchofdimes.com/cgi-) bin/MsmGo.exe? Competing interests: Grandfather od a child with regressive autism Competing interests: No competing interests Sir I certainly regard some of the opinions and reports from the 'antivaccination lobby' (as he refers to those who have decided that vaccinations are far less safe than Flegg, and the pro-vaccination lobby, would have the public believe) as highly credible scientific reflections. I was not referring to individual pieces of evidence but summaries presented after serious scientific reflection by such people. I temper my enthusiasm for those reflections with my own knowledge which, if he read my response on Vaccine Mythology as referenced he will know it is born of my own reflections through many hundreds of scientific papers obtained from Medlines PubMed website and others. Peter Flegg's comment was not unexpected; after sharing many responses with him I have come to expect a tirade of innuendo, presented in his didactic style, when he is faced with scientific reasoning he cannot rebut. Perhaps he would care to answer a few questions within his speciality in evidence-supported scientific style... I am aware that MMR causes death, fits and other severe reactions within minutes, hours and days but am also aware that many, if not most, cases of autism and other chronic debilitating disorders are not diagnosed until many months and years have passed after vaccination so are not recognised in 'short term' followup - the point I make. Would Flegg disagree? If Flegg does not disagree, can he explain how a study of \"over 1000 unvaccinated children and their twin siblings\" using \"short term follow- up\" can identify a relationship between the MMR vaccination and autism/other chronic debilitating disorders? Flegg's \"intrigue\" as to how someone determines regression into autism is caused by MMR is answered in many cases by the causal chain to autism that obviously extends from MMR vaccination through to end diagnosis - shown in the main through continuous parental observation, and if available supported by medical notes. The great problem for the sufferer, and safeguard for vaccinator, is that proof of cause is more difficult to establish through long-term effects - even with a causal chain - when medical science is the only mode through which evidence of cause is deduced and is why only a properly conducted criminal investigation in response to each and every allegation of MMR-induced damage with proper legal evidential procedures including collection, collation and deduction, should be performed so that every piece of material, direct, indirect and circumstantial (which are not medical scientific terms therefore are essential aspects for any full investigation of harm) evidence is made available to the adjudicators. One determines regression from MMR to autism through that mode, using every process, tool and procedure provided by UK, European and International law. Victim and witness evidence, especially parental where sufficiently close to the victim through the victim's regression, are essential. Where evidence of cause, through proper criminal investigation, is 'beyond reasonable doubt', despite the limitations of medical scientific evidence, MMR should be blamed. At the moment there does not appear to be a properly constituted body, prepared to instigate a proper criminal response to allegations by victim and carer/parent of vaccination damage, which considers properly all aspects of evidence to do justice to such cases; the recent refusal on what appears to have been 'medical scientific grounds' to provide legal aid in such cases proves this point. Every case should be placed before the police and criminal prosecution service. For example, whether there is sufficient medical scientific evidence for MMR to have induced inflammation in the brain of a particular individual who developed autism or not there is a great deal of circumstantial evidence sufficient, when combined with witness evidence of an unbroken causal chain in that individual, that ought to provide prima facie evidence for a case to proceed criminally. If one shoots a gun into a crowd it is criminally irresponsible - it is known that the shot can cause serious injury. All vaccinators are aware that vaccinations can cause serious injury, they do not necessarily know who will succumb when their 'gun is fired into the crowd' but are prepared to kill and maim members of the crowd so must be prepared for criminal process if one presents itself. John H. ps. I expect more innuendo in didactic style... Competing interests: None declared Competing interests: No competing interests Thank you for your reminder and no, I had not for a moment forgotten the matter you raise. I had hoped that my mention of \"unless their family situation requires it\", would have indicated that. Indeed, the main thrust of necessity of the rubella component is surely that it is administered with that outcome in mind. Competing interests: Father of vaccine/brain-damaged daughter who also has autistic syndrome Competing interests: No competing interests Dear Sir, In response to Peter Flegg >>>> If one takes the view that measles is so problematic in those with any degree of nutritional deficiency, it seems reasonable to include the simple, cheap and effective expedient of vaccination as part of one's strategy. In contrast, trying to raise the nutritional status of children in Possilpark, for example, provides a far harder challenge. >>>> Very true. Expedient, being the operative word, no? Expendient meaning \"advantageous\" or \"politic\" according to my dictionary. I like the use of the words \"in contrast\" for in reality, the \"in contrast\" part of the equation isn't \"part of\" the medical professions strategy. Which presumably is why the use of the words \"in contrast\". Obviously, the best solution is just to vaccinate. Which in reality, is what happens now. As implied, the harder challenge of raising the nutritional status of people means real work, communication with people (not at people), the sharing of real knowledge. Old fashioned \"shoe leather\" epidemiology. Caring about more than just injections for X diseases; caring for the larger long term picture of it all. If successful, this harder challenge ensures that doctors see far LESS of their patients in the future, because their health is so much better. This effort would mean, as Jamie Robertson points out, less money is needed for hospitals, for both treatment, and also, .... medical salaries. But maybe more jobs on the \"effort\" front, the real preventive front, where people are educated and given the confidence to take much more responsibility for their own health, instead of stepping up like an automaton for quick fixes, after the expending of millions in an advertising blitz. This effort might also result in fewer health problems for the pharmaceutical gravy train to fund, to find the right drug to solve X health problem. Trouble is, shareholders won't like that. Such an expedient cost/benefit equation certainly won't include seriously considering big monkey wrenches like whether these \"simple, cheap and expedient\" vaccines might possibly mess up the immune system of the nutritionally impaired children, or permanently damage children of some of the parents who post here. Except in the \"very rare\" occasion. What it really comes back to, is that all important cost/benefit analysis, which determines what is perceived as the best use for the dollar. Hilary Butler. Competing interests: Our children, because we are educated, have rarely seen the doctor for other than accidents, and never had antibiotics. Competing interests: No competing interests Bill Gates's gesture would obviously be more completely impressive if it were to become part of some wider serious and imaginative attempt to alleviate human misery. You cannot, of course, just inject people with good health - and what looks increasingly like a game of roulette in the developed world could be even more hazardous in an immune deficient population with poor nutrition and hygeine. Let us hope anyhow that in these promised Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation programmes the advice of Clemetson, Kalokerinos, Innis and Yazbak is properly heeded. Competing interests: Parent of an autistic child Competing interests: No competing interests Christina England states she is not anti-vaccine, a fact that I did appreciate and I respect her choices and legitimate concerns she has concerning vaccination. It is both understandable and tempting to view an infant's immune system as being immature, and therefore to try and resist \"overloading\" it at such a crucial age with multiple vaccines. However this is a simplistic and untrue reflection of the situation. Further information on this topic can be found in the Institute of Medicine's quite balanced review (1) and other papers (2). The Offit paper explains how there are currently fewer than 45 antigens administered within the current UK infant immunisation schedule, compared to over 3000 which were contained in the vaccines I was exposed to as a child some 40+ years ago. I believe that this is where the quotes about the infant being able to tolerate thousands of antigens in vaccines are derived (but certain people still persist in trying to confuse individual antigens with individual vaccine injections). England is incorrect in stating that the outbreak of mumps in 16-25 year olds is occuring in those who must have had MMR. Vaccination only began in 1988, therefore this age group represents a non-immune, unvaccinated population who are of an age when viruses such as mumps that are spread through \"kissing contact\" are at their peak. Mumps vaccine is very effective. References: (1) [http://books.nap.edu/books/0309083281/html/index.html](http://books.nap.edu/books/0309083281/html/index.html) (2) Offit PA, et al. 2002.
