Now, she makes Reiki \u2014 a therapy using a light touch or hands placed near a patient's body to assist the idea that energy as a universal life force can be channeled for healing \u2014 and a half-dozen other mind-body services available to patients as manager of SwedishAmerican Hospital's Holistic Health Services. Keith changed her mind about complementary therapies when she heard what patients said after they had received the treatments. \"I decided to be more open-minded about the possibilities,\" she said, \"and I set out to engage in more educational and experiential activities so I could make a decision for myself. I became less dogmatic about yes or no, or black or white. \"Suddenly, there was a lot more gray and I had to say maybe there's more to this than I understand.\" Reiki Energy International, a Rockford-area group of practitioners which recently attained federal tax-exempt status as a nonprofit charity, will offer anyone interested the chance to make up their own mind about Reiki at a 6 p.m. open house Thursday at Community of Christ Church, 6103 Forest Hills Road. \"There are lots of small groups of Reiki practitioners that gather once a month or every so often and work on each other or work on other people who come in,\" Reiki Energy International President Tom Blodgett said. \"We would like to form a network of all these groups so that people who are looking to join a group or looking to get a treatment can go online and find somebody in their area.\" Richard Gubbe, who has taught Reiki for 20 years including in programs at Rock Valley and Kishwaukee colleges, said the group's goals also include performing community service, research, certification of Reiki practitioners and serving as a social focus practitioners and people of like interests. In a Reiki treatment, the practitioner attempts to transmit positive energy to the patient and to affect the patient's energy in a beneficial way. There are 12 areas of the body \u2014 four each on the head, front of the torso and back \u2014 where a practitioner will work. Sandy Farnham, a practitioner who performs treatments in hospitals and hospice situations, said she can sometimes feel heat in an area and feel it dissipate as she works. \"I work at least 20 hours a week in hospitals,\" Farnham said. \"And when they are hooked up to the monitors, you can see the blood pressure go down, you can see the heart rate go down. You can see them relax.\" Keith was part of a team from SwedishAmerican that reported in early June at a national conference for complementary and integrative medicine about a study of Rockford's medical population, including the University of Illinois College of Medicine, seeking their impressions of holistic care, integrative medicine and the different modalities of complementary and alternative medicine and therapies. The study was done among focus groups of physicians, pharmacists, nurses, students of pharmacy, nursing and medicine as well as complementary and alternative-medicine providers and consumers. \"The impression by many folks, going in, was that doctors are not going to support this and they're going to think it's mumbo jumbo, but everybody else is going to think its marvelous,\" Keith said. She said the study found that doctors were aware the general population wants their opinion on alternative therapies and \"what the physicians said was we're not trained in that area and we may not personally believe in it but, if it does no harm and the patient believes or perceives that it is helping them cope with whatever their situation is, and we have a place to refer patients to be linked with appropriate practitioners, we're OK with that.\" Keith, who has received some Reiki training, said that for the practitioner, a treatment is somewhat of a spiritual experience. \"That's not saying it's religious,\" Keith said. \"It means that it's not physical. It may mean something to the practitioner and, hopefully, it means something to the person who is going to receive it. It's an activity where they're sending, for lack of a better term, some loving kindness energy to that pain spot.\" Gubbe said Reiki is not \"a belief system, although it helps if you believe in it, but the patient can even be in a coma. You're not making a conscious decision if you're in a coma. What it does is it makes you relax and when you relax, you heal.\" Gubbe said acceptance of complementary and alternative treatments by government and the medical community is constantly improving. \"In the old days, it wasn't very well received,\" he said. \"When I started teaching 20 years ago, you couldn't even advertise. It was very underground and now we have the opportunity to walk into a place that's a public health facility and do a treatment on somebody and it's considered good.\" Keith sees research into complementary and alternative therapies continuing \"because there's enough really good stuff that's beginning to develop that says 'hmm, maybe it's not woo-woo, foo-foo. Maybe there really is something to this and maybe we need to change our expectations about how this type of subject is researched and measured'.\" Mike DeDoncker can be reached "}
