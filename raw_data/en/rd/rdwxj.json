Indonesia has 30,000 plant species, of which about 9,600 species are known to have medicinal properties and only 200 species have been utilized as raw materials in traditional medicine industries. This biodiversity richness needs to be explored, developed and utilized for the improvement of health and economic goals while maintaining its sustainability. 1 Indonesia is not only rich in its biodiversity but it is also well known as a country with high diversity of ethnicities. Each ethnic group has extensive experienced in the utilization and conservation of biological and ecological diversity. This biocultural richness provided ethnobotanical researchers with endless r esearch opportunities.2 Kalimantan is the largest island in Indonesia that is famous for its biodiversity. Beside that, there are knowledge of traditional medicine using plants that are passed on orally from generation to generation on indigenous ethnic in Kalimantan. These biodiversity are scattered all over Kalimantan island, one of which is in Central Kalimantan Province. Central Kalimantan with an area of 15,380,410 hectares where about 70% is considered as forested area is the home of medicinal plant biodiversity.3,4 People in Anjir Pulang Pisau Village still use plants as a traditional medicine to cure diseases. Usefulness they know from t he narrative of the parents, exchange ideas with other members of the community and the results of his own exper ience. This knowledge is hereditary delivered orally and generally passed down to family members. The advancement of science and technology was not able to simply eliminate the meaning of traditional medicine. Treatment in traditional ways is increasingl y popular both domestically and abroad. The use of medicinal plants has traditionally been favored because it is believed to have no side effects as well as dangerous chemicals. The growing development of natural -made medicinal products by pharmaceutical c ompanies, causing research is being conducted in many countries with the aim of increasing the use of traditional medicine for the welfare of the human populations.5 There is no ethnomedicinal study in Anjir Pulang Pisau Village. Hence, the present study w as initiated to investigate the medicinal plants usage in Anjir Pulang Pisau Village, Central Kalimantan -Indonesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study area The study of an ethnomedicinal survey for medicinal plants was conducted in Anjir Pulang Pisau Village wh part of Central Kalimantan Province, ABSTRACT Background: The use of medicinal plants in Anjir Pulang Pisau Village has been car ried out for a long time through knowledge that is passed down through generations to family members. But there is no documentation of local knowledge about medicinal plants.

Selection of informant A total of 54 local peoples of different ages (18 -65 years) were selected, and interviewed as key informants. The selected local peoples used medicinal plants for traditional health care in their daily activities. Data collection Eth nomedicinal data was collected through individual interviews using semi \u2014structured interviews. Information regarding the plant's local name, medicinal uses, parts used, methods of preparation, and administration route were documented. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the collected ethnomedicinal data. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION During the field survey in the study area, informant reported ethnomedicinal data of 28 species of medicinal plants. The 19 medicinal plant species distributed across 17 families, while families of 9 medicinal plant species unidentified. A total of 28 medicinal plants were recorded as being used to treat 19 different types of diseases as shown in T able 1. The family Anacardiaceae, Poaceae, Lamicaeae and Myrtaceae had the highest proportion of medicinal plants used (7% each), followed by other families with only one plant species per family (4% each), and families of other unidentified plant species (21%) (Figure 2). Further research is needed to identify the families and species of unidentified medicinal plants. The most frequently utilized medicinal plant parts were roots (47%), followed by bark (19%), leaves and stem (9% each), flowers (6%), and Figure 1: Location of the study area. 1574 Family and Scientific name Local name Medicinal uses Parts used Methods of preparation Administration route Anacardiaceae Bouea macrophylla Annonaceae Annona muricata L.

Most of the plant species were used to treat one disease, while some were used to treat two or more diseases. The most frequent plant species used to cure disease was Curcuma zedoaria Hara were each reported to treat 11% of the diseases (Figure 4). In terms of frequency of medicinal plant uses, the highest percentag e of plant species (21%) was used to treat wound, followed by breast cancer, diabetes, and hypertension (11% each). Other diseases were treated with less than 10% of the medicinal plants recorded (Figure 5). According to the available literatures, some o f the reported medicinal plant species were found to have some phytochemical and biological activities. Bouea macrophylla Griff. can be used to treat vomit and diarrhea. This plant has numerous contents and one of them is flavonoid that function as antibac terial and antioxidant. Previous studies indicates that the total content of flavonoids in Bouea macrophylla Griff. leaf is higher than in Bouea macrophylla Griff. bark. Flavonoid are included in the largest group of phenol compounds that have very activ e properties to slow the growth of viruses, bacteria, and fungi. 6 The root part of Cordyline fruticosa (L.) A.Chev. used by local people for vaginal discharge treatment. The plant of the genus Cordyline are very well known as source of steroidal saponins and cholestane glycosides. 1576 Figure 3: Plant parts used for medicinal purposes. Figure 4: Medicinal plant species with highest percentage of total disease treated. Figure 5: Frequency of medicinal plants uses to cure disease. 1577 Steroidal saponins was known for their biological antimicrobial, antifungal, and in (L.) that ethanol extract of Ananas comosus (L.) Merr. leaves possess signific ant hypocholesterolemic activity. The acute toxicity also showed that the extract has a high safety profile as neither death nor symptomps associated with toxicity was observed at high dose level (5 gm/kg) in high cholesterol fed albino rats. 8 Extract ethanol of Orthosiphon aristatus (Blume.) Miq. leaf produced the strong antimicrobial effect, Candida Some of these microorganism are the cause of urinary tract infections.9 -10 The local people used Arcangelisia flava (L.) Merr. to cure liver. Higher dose of Arcangelisia flava (L.) Merr. extract shows hepatoprotective ac tivity by preventing the elevation of serum transaminases and transferase levels. Eventually, no damage in the acetaminophen - induced rat's liver was observed. This plant modulates the expression of caspase 3 protein in dose -dependent manner. 11 Ethobota nical studies have recorded the use of Psidium guajava L. via infusion and decoction of leaves, roots, and seeds to treat malaria. The pharmacological effect of this plant has investigated, both its in vitro and in vivo potential. 12 The aqueous extract of the leaves of Bambusa vulgaris Schrad. Demonstrated important antiplasmodial activity against the Plasmodium parasites wit the chloroquinesensitive 3D7 P. falciparum being more susceptible. However, the antiplasmodial activity of stem Rhodomyrtus been reported to contain various phytochemical compositions in many part of the plant, including steroids, flavonoids, and alkaloid compounds. Flavonoid and alkaloids are widely used in the form of the drug to treat diabetes, skin disorders and anti -inflammation. 14 Curcuma zedoaria (Christm.) Roscoe. have been shown to possess pharmacological properties like was known to contain a ntioxidant and antibacterial compounds, so it can be efficacious as an eye sore. 16 Annona muricata L. and Sandoricum koetjape (Burm.f.) Merr. were known to have antibacterial compound, 17,18 and both plant species were used to treat stomach ache by loca l people. Leaf part of Annona muricata L. also used by Ayta Communities in Dinalupihan, Bataan, for treat stomach ache. 19 Jatropha multifida L. and Stenochlaena palustris (Burm.f.) Bedd. were used by local people to cure wound. The antibacterial assay of Jatropa multifida L. showed an in vitro growth inhibition of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in dose -dependent manner. 20 Stenochlaena palustris (Burm.f.) Bedd. was known as antioxidant and antimicrobial, so it can be efficacious to cure wound.21 -22 Various st udies reported that lower blood sugar levels.23 -25 Majority of the plant remedies in this study were prepared by decoction (40%), then by crushed or pounded (31%), infu sion (20%), and concoction (9%) (Figure 6). Some herbal preparations were taken by mixing with lime paste. Most medicinal plant preparations were taken orally (75%), while 19% were used topically for disease such as wounds, breast cancers, and stomach ache (Figure 7). Various ethnomedicinal studies conducted elsewhere also reported that oral as the predominant route of administration. plants preparation method. Figure 7: Route of administration of medicinal plant. CONCLUSION With this ethnomedicinal study, 28 medicinal plants were determined to be used for different medicinal purposes by local people. This study is the first on determination of medicinal plants used in Anjir Pulang Pisau Village. So, it is very important to preserve traditional culture on traditional medicine and survive for future generations. Further resear ch is needed to identify unidentified family and plant species. Pharmacognostical and pharmacological studies are also needed for the identification of chemical compounds and proving the efficacy of medicinal plants used by local people.
