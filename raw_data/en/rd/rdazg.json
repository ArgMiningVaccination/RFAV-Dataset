IV Vitamin Therapy is an intravenous injection (intramuscular, subcutaneous) of vitamins, minerals, amino acids and homeopathic remedies that is a safe and effective way to deliver nutrients directly to the cells of the body. Substances given by this route are directly absorbed into the circulatory system, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract and liver, thereby increasing the absorptive capability of the individual. Vitamin drips are individually designed around the personal needs of each patient. IV therapy can contain a mixture of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other nutrients depending on test results and ongoing patient assessments. At Hawaii Natural Medicine we recognize that inflammation of and malabsorption by the digestive tract is almost always a major factor in chronic illness and an obstacle to health. There is no more efficient way to get the necessary vitamins, minerals, and nutrients into the body than through an IV Drip. Using IV therapy, we are able to bypass the digestive tract and deliver nutrients directly to the tissues, speeding up metabolic change. The addition of IV therapy to any other treatments greatly reduces the amount of treatment time needed to cure chronic illness. IV therapy is individualized according to the patient and the treatment goals. Various vitamins, minerals, electrolytes, botanicals, antioxidants and homeopathic may be safely administered to enhance the therapeutic response and it is often prescribed as part of a complete, holistic and individualized treatment plan. For those individuals who are generally healthy and interested in \"anti-aging\" or simply preventative medicine, IV Drips offer delivery of high concentrations of potent anti-oxidants to combat oxidative stress which is a marker of premature aging, degenerative diseases, and pre-cancerous states.
