To re-cap, many believe auras to be the energy field that surrounds our body. The science is slim, but there's plenty of evidence that points towards the important role that energy can play in our [emotional wellbeing](https://www.vogue.in/wellness/content/how-to-improve-emotional-resilience-and-mental-immunity). Our bodies are made of energy-producing particles that move constantly to create vibrations and rhythms. This is tangible in things like our heartbeat and breath rates, but they happen on a smaller scale in each of our cells - and researchers have even been able to measure this. Internal factors like stress, illness and outlook can affect our energy, as can external factors like the temperature, seasons and sounds and these inform our vibrations. Different colours vibrate at different levels, each has its own wavelength, which mean different things. Likewise we all have energies we emit and are drawn too. Auras help match you up with your colour based on your vibrations. And, of course, this can feed into our lifestyle and [beauty routines](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/how-to-edit-your-skincare-routine-simple-beauty-routine-for-beginners), too. I spoke to [hairstylist](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/8-bollywood-celebrity-hairstylists-to-follow-on-instagram-now), healer and clairvoyant, Allison McKinley at Salon My Place to explain more. \"Depending on what is going on with our chakras, our aura can change. I had one mentor describe it like layers of colour. When things are going well ( [sleeping well](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/how-to-sleep-better-the-4-best-strategies-according-to-the-experts), inner work, tuning into your heart) your aura can shine brighter. Just like in beauty, we look our best when we feel our best, our auras are the same,\" she explains. \"The more we take care of our inner world through [meditation](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/the-manifold-benefits-of-meditation-and-how-to-get-into-a-routine), proper sleep, eating well, following our hearts etc, our true aura will shine though. Maybe we can thank our auras for the 'glow' we sometimes have.\" We asked Allison to translate the best haircuts to match our auras. Unsure what yours is? See if you recognise yourself below.

Red Grounded, strong, passionate \"Red auras are for the grounded, business types who know how to lead,\" says Allison. \"So a structured, power [bob](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/the-no-cut-rolled-bob-is-your-hack-for-some-serious-volume) is definitely the perfect choice.\" This means blunt edges and sleek styling. Pink Gentle, emotional, thoughtful \"Pink auras live in their hearts,\" says Allison. \"Whether their hair's long or short, they love texture and [softness](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/shanaya-kapoor-kriti-sanon-more-celebrities-embracing-the-soft-waves-hair-trend),\" she adds, like natural waves, curls, coils and kinks. So, it's best to choose products that work perfectly at emphasising and celebrating your own texture. Orange Adventurous, thrill-seeking, confident \"Orange auras are adventurous, so they're hard to peg down with one colour or cut,\" says Allison. They're the types that would change their [colour](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/the-8-biggest-hair-colour-trends-making-a-splash-this-spring) regularly and they can pull off more rebellious cuts, \"I'm thinking a texturised bixie,\" says Allison, who reckons the bob-pixie hybrid would be work perfectly. Yellow Creative, friendly, relaxed \"Yellow auras are the types of folks that love having their hair cut, but wind up waiting to book because they're so relaxed,\" says Allison. She recommends \"textured layers,\" which still look great even as they grow out. Likewise a curtain fringe just gets better over time. \"I can also see some grown-out [balayage](https://www.vogue.in/story/how-to-make-the-most-out-of-your-french-balayage-makeover/) for these chill folks,\" says Allison. Green Compassionate, responsible, healing \"These folks are out there changing the world as activists and caretakers,\" says Allison. \"Hair is not on their radar so something practical is in order,\" she says, \"Like long with no layers,\" or very gentle layers. \"It must be left long enough for a top knot or [braids](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/from-deepika-padukone-to-kim-kardashian-here-are-our-favourite-braided-hairstyles),\" she says. Blue Tranquil, wise, intuitive Blue auras are known for their truth and honesty. They're calm, open, communicative and and are in touch with their spiritual side. \"They suit [long](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/long-hair-care-tips-hair-styling-best-products-for-breaking-hair), beautiful flowing hair,\" says Allison. \"Think Elsa Frozen, with a touch witchy crone vibes.\" Indigo Curious, spiritual, empathetic \"Indigo auras are so comfortable in their inner world. They are confident and their hair is an extension of this,\" says Allison. They're not afraid of choppy texture and more offbeat cuts, so [shag bangs](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/shag-bangs-are-the-cool-girl-haircut-trend-to-add-volume-and-texture) are a perfect choice, they blend the mussy texture of a shag into a fringe and can be worn with equally shaggy hair or long, flowing layers. They can be drawn to bolder colour choices, too, \"perhaps some bluish, indigo highlight in with their balayage,\" says Allison. Violet Far-sighted, perceptive, independent Violet auras seek enlightenment and can see the bigger picture. They're one of the most perceptive shades and their sensitive side means they love to guide others to their highest potential, too. \"I picture [glossy hair](https://www.vogue.in/beauty/content/diy-haircare-rituals-that-celebrities-rely-on-for-shiny-luscious-locks) that shines like their beautiful crowns,\" says Allison.
