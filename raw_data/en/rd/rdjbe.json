More and more people are finding an interest in earth's natural methods for healing the body. Herbal concoctions, medicinal plants, and other hippie-inspired measures are gaining ground. While some people swear by the effectiveness of such medicine, others are quite skeptical. So which is the truth? Do these methods work? Or is this market nothing more than incredibly fancy snake oil? What is a Natural Remedy? The definition of natural medicine is incredibly broad. To narrow it down, we're mostly talking about herbs, medicinal plants, oils, and an assortment of vitamins and minerals. These are the types of items that you would likely find in a health food store, or from the local gardener who creates different syrups, soups, and other remedies in their kitchen. They might be labeled natural, alternative, or environmental in description. Do They Work? The real answer is ... sometimes. It's hard to deny that some types of herbs and natural medicines work. In fact, even some traditional doctors will encourage you to take vitamins such as echinacea to boost the immune system, or to try elderberry throughout cold and flu season. Some of nature's solutions are quite effective at healing the body, but you have to know their purpose, and you must be selective in what you choose to use. How Do I Know the Difference? It can be frustrating to try to decipher what works from what is more of a placebo. Your best bet is to do your research. If you've used an item and it works for you, great! If you've never used an item and you have questions about it, look it up, ask professionals, and gain a little knowledge. Information is as simple as clicking a few buttons in this day and age, so finding what you need is simple. With that said, listening to your general practitioner is always a good idea. Even if you want to go the natural route most of the time, a doctor's advice most definitely has its place and should be heeded in many circumstances. Other Natural Remedies There are natural approaches to better health that really do work, and they don't interfere with advice from your regular doctor. If you want to go natural, try adding more water, exercising, getting chiropractic care, and adjusting your diet. All of these are natural and noninvasive ways to boost your health, and you don't have to do any guesswork about whether or not they'll be effective. They will, and you'll notice the benefits. It's OK to be interested in natural remedies for better health. In fact, many natural methods are highly effective. But it's definitely important to do your research and ask those who know more than you. Natural medicine is a lot more than snake oil ... but only when it's used the right way. Done properly, you can live a more natural life with benefits that make your health better than ever before. To learn more about your health and wellness, see [your local chiropractor at "}
