FAQ Iboga V. Ibogaine Iboga Detox is so effective as a tool because it blocks the physical withdrawals, while also helping the person to heal the wounds that led to their addictive behavior in the first place. With our Bwiti and science based program, the mental and spiritual healing guests receive is much greater than most sterilized Ibogaine Clinics can offer. Working with just Ibogaine is like using just one ingredient of a perfect dish. Ibogaine is just one of the active alkaloids found in Iboga. Iboga's alkaloids have been found to have individual benefits, but also work together synergistically for optimal healing. Why would you change what is already perfectly made by nature itself? Not to mention, Iboga is actually much safer than Ibogaine as it actually is more effective due to the synergistic/individual benefits of these alkaloids and doesn't require such high levels to be effective. Please read our article \" [Why Iboga is better than Ibogaine](https://roothealing.com/iboga/why-is-iboga-better-than-ibogaine/)\" to learn more. Scientific research reveals that the [ main active alkaloid - Ibogaine](https://roothealing.com/iboga/ibogaine-alkaloid-benefits/) has potent benefits for the brain which accounts for the efficacy of Iboga Detox. Studies have shown that those who receive an Iboga Detox treatment, can have a painless detox, free themselves from depression and have the ability to model a healthier life post-treatment. For example, several studies report that taking Ibogaine can dramatically decrease symptoms of drug addiction and withdrawal. In the largest one, the majority of which with at least 4 years of opioid abuse history (1), 80% experienced reduced withdrawal symptoms and half of the participants reported reduced craving for opioids. Ibogaine has also been shown to have long-term anti-addiction benefits post-treatment. This is likely due to its effects on [neuroplasticity](https://roothealing.com/iboga/iboga-ibogaine-neuroplasticity/) aka the brain's ability to adapt and form new connections. Laboratory experiments suggest that the alkaloid can activate several neurotrophic growth factors in the brain which play a key role in these processes (2). For example, low levels of Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are associated with long-term drug use effects and addiction (3). Triggering this factor may be one of the mechanisms via which Ibogaine rewires the brain and induces long-term abstinence. Another factor that's also activated by the alkaloid is Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). It plays a role in brain healing by stimulating brain cell survival and the formation of new connections (synapses) between them (4). Thanks to Ibogaine's effect on increasing dopamine and serotonin levels in the brain, the alkaloid exerts beneficial effects on mood and depression as well. Clinical trials report that symptoms of depression are significantly reduced, even 30 days after the therapy with the "}
