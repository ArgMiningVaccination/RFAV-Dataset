These practices may not form the standard medical care for diseases like cancer, but they play an integral role in promoting holistic wellness. According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), CAM enables people with cancer to manage side effects like nausea, pain, fatigue, and depression. This approach also gives patients the feeling that they are doing something to promote their own wellness. It is also an attempt to treat and even cure cancer for many who choose Complementary and Alternative Medicine. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one-third of all cancer deaths or causes are due to high body mass index, use of tobacco, excessive alcohol consumption, lack of physical activity and poor nutrition (low fruit and vegetable intake). It is also common knowledge that with early detection, many cancers can be cured. Considering this, how we live our lives and the choices we make for nutrition, mental health and overall lifestyle are at the core of concern. Whether you have cancer or not, this article is for you. The key message is that better choices for health and wellness will pay off, in terms of disease prevention or management. Organic Aromas had a Q & A session with our good friend Julien Griffault, a cancer survivor who has devoted his time and energy to sharing vital tips for health and wellness from his own journey. He shared his story and discussed how he has incorporated essential oils along the way. Q&A Interview with Julien Griffault Organic Aromas: Julien, it's a pleasure to talk to you. Your journey has inspired and encouraged many people from all walks of life. Briefly share your background with us; where were you born and where did you attend school? Julien: It is so nice to speak with you as well. My family traveled quite a bit while I was growing up. My parents are French, and I was born in New York. So far, I have been fortunate to live in the US, Italy, Holland, France and even spent a few years in Mauritius. I went to both high school and university in Paris, France. Awesome. When and how did you find out that you had cancer? I found out I had cancer in November of 2018. I had been experiencing some abdominal pain and swelling for quite some time and believed it to be an ulcer. I had been to several doctors, but no one really knew what to make of this swelling in my abdomen. Eventually a full scan was done along with a biopsy. Several weeks later the results came back, it was testicular cancer which had spread to my abdomen, liver, kidney, and neck. My wife and I were devastated. I was 42 years old. Why did you decide to make your journey with cancer public? I started a [small website as a form of personal therapy](http://my-cancer-journey.com). Writing can be very helpful especially when you are in a hospital bed for long periods of time. You see, up until that moment I had lived what most would consider to be a very healthy life. I ate an all-organic diet, took vitamins and minerals specific to my needs and even did regular detoxification procedures. What I was not tending to was my emotional and mental health. I was stressed, bitter, angry, and blaming everyone outside of myself for my unhappiness. Cancer came as a major wake up call to make a change. So, one part of the site is personal reflections on why I feel cancer came into my life, what I have learned so far. The other is more practical where I talk about many of the alternative therapies I followed in addition to intensive chemotherapy. Getting a cancer diagnosis is quite terrifying. I hope what I share can help someone else one day. In your online cancer resources, you share a lot of information about using essential oils when battling cancer. How has using these oils helped in your journey? Also, does essential oil quality and method of application matter? I have been using essential oils for well over 15 years now. I used to be a massage therapist and they were a big part of my sessions. Essential oils have supported me so much in my healing journey. I used them daily, especially when I was stuck in the hospital. I used essential oils for immunity support, for nausea relief and for emotional support among others. Somehow it felt comforting to inhale some of those precious oils, especially during the more difficult moments. Quality is crucial. If you are not able to use high quality, pure essential oils then might as well not use them at all. This applies to anyone but especially those with lowered immune systems. Once applied to the skin it takes less than 15 minutes for the oils to enter the bloodstream and for their frequency and properties to affect every cell in the body. You want clean oils without any additives, even if you only intend to use them in a diffuser. I like to apply oils to the bottom of my feet, my wrists, and the back of my neck. It is important to be aware of the 'heat' of each essential oil. Some oils like clove or cinnamon are very 'hot' and can burn. Oils need to be diluted properly. They are highly concentrated so less is more. My overall favorite thing to do is diffuse essential oils. Using a Nebulizing diffuser that uses only essential oils, no water, no heat, just pulsed air. This is key to enjoying all the benefits of your high-quality oils. In your experience, what are the 5 best essential oils for cancer patients and why? Great question. I can't speak for everyone but here are 5 best essential oils for cancer patients based on my experience. Cypress. This one may come as a surprise, but it was probably the most helpful. You see when I was undergoing Chemotherapy, I would experience sudden and abundant nosebleeds. Applying a few drops of Cypress to my wrists and the bridge of my nose helped stop the flow within a couple of minutes. I always had it with me. [Frankincense](https://organicaromas.com/products/benefits-and-uses-of-frankincense-essential-oil/). I applied this powerful essential oil undiluted to tumor areas and ears daily. I also took several drops under my tongue regularly. That is another reason to only buy the highest quality oils. When you are dealing with cancer you need to be quite aggressive and support the body on multiple levels. Several studies have shown frankincense to be effective against certain cancer cells. Frankincense is also anti-inflammatory (which is so important for cancer patients), supports circulation, promotes skin health, and even supports proper digestion. The ears have acupressure points that connect to every part of the body. Massaging them with an essential oil helps to support and stimulate internal organs. This has similar benefits to rubbing your feet with oils. Peppermint. It is no secret that chemotherapy patients experience horrible nausea. I had a very strong chemotherapy regimen, yet my nausea levels were mild. I attribute this to many of the alternative therapies I was following. However, when I did get nauseous, I would rub a couple of drops of peppermint on my abdomen and take a drop internally and the nausea would go away within seconds. I still use peppermint in that way if ever I experience discomfort after a meal. [Bergamot](https://organicaromas.com/products/benefits-and-uses-of-bergamot-organic-essential-oil/). I love bergamot essential oil. It is citrusy with floral undertones. I would put a couple of drops of this beautifully fragrant essential oil on a tissue and inhale whenever I felt anxious or stressed (which was quite often). It is both uplifting and relaxing and a great oil to use when you feel stressed. I would breathe it in at night when I had a hard time sleeping and needed some emotional support. I would recommend diffusing bergamot in your bedroom in the evening an hour or so before bedtime, so the fragrance is there, but it is not overpowering. Finally, I would recommend a protective blend that contains some of the most powerful antiviral and antibacterial essential oils. Different companies have different names for them, but they are all very similar. They often have names like Thieves, Bandits etc... inspired from a blend of herbs a group of thieves used to protect themselves when stealing from homes where people died from the plague. I used one of those blends daily. They are quite 'hot 'so diluting them 50/50 is recommended. I applied the diluted blend generously to my chest, neck and feet for protection and immune support. Cancer patients tend to have very low immunity so natural support and protection is key especially if one is going to a hospital or infusion center. I hope this helps! You speak of feeling overwhelming stress, anger, and anxiety prior to getting sick. In your experience, what are the 5 best essential oils for stress relief? What a great question! There are many uplifting essential oils out there, I'll try to narrow it down to my 5 favorites. Bergamot. I love Bergamot essential oil as stated earlier. It is citrusy with floral undertones. I put a couple of drops of this beautifully fragrant essential oil on a tissue and inhale whenever I feel anxious or stressed. It is both uplifting and relaxing. When I was at the hospital, I would breathe it in at night for a little emotional support. Frankincense. In addition to being good for cancer patients, this precious oil is a champion when it comes to helping me feel more energized and uplifted. Just breathing it in for a few moments helps me let go of stress and focus on the present moment. Highly recommended! [Lemon](https://organicaromas.com/products/benefits-and-uses-of-lemon-organic-essential-oil/) and/or Orange essential oil. Citrus oils just make me happy. I love diffusing them in the house, they seem to make any room feel cleaner, brighter, and happier. They are like rays of sunshine you can bring out anytime you are feeling a little low. [Ylang Ylang](https://organicaromas.com/products/ylang-ylang-essential-oil/). This one is very exotic and reminds me of a tropical vacation. I find this essential oil uplifting, relaxing and a great tool to dissolve stress anytime. I like to reach for ylang ylang anytime I feel trapped in a negative thought loop. Within minutes I drop the negativity and have a much easier time focusing on the positive. My final pick for most uplifting essential oil must be Sandalwood. This oil is one of my all-time favorites. It's warm and spicy aroma seems to naturally draw me into the present moment. I find it to be relaxing, balancing, uplifting, and grounding. I like to use sandalwood when I need a little help getting out of my head (fear, anxiety) and back into my body. I really enjoy diffusing it during meditation. There are many others such as Rose, Lemongrass and even Lavender. I find essential oils to be very helpful tools for emotional and mental wellbeing. I would suggest your readers experiment with different oils and see how they make them feel. Our connection to essential oils is deeply personal. Talk to people who have just gotten that cancer confirmation from their doctor. What is the most important thing/things that they should keep in mind? Wow, how much time do you have? That is a tough one. If I could speak to them directly, I would say: You are much stronger than you think. It is normal to be afraid but don't give up. Often, cancer is a message that something needs to change. From this moment onwards you can choose to make YOU important. You can decide that you matter, that your feelings matter, that your dreams matter, even if they are inconvenient to others. So, what does that look like? What would you like to do differently in your life? Starting today, decide to laugh more and spend time doing the things you love with the people you love. Laughter is powerful, being surrounded by people we love and who love us is healing. Another really important piece is to find someone to talk to. Most insurance covers mental health and finding someone you can be vulnerable and brutally honest with is so important. This is not always possible with family and friends as they are dealing with their own fears about the situation. There is a lot more, but I'll stop there. I understand that my perspective may not resonate with everyone and that is fine. I have seen many cancer patients and while they certainly could have led healthier lives, almost all of them felt a deep sense of sadness, or experienced prolonged high levels of stress. I was at death's door when I started treatment. Three years later, after receiving so many prayers from family and friends, endless energy healing from my amazing wife, following alternatives in addition to conventional treatments, I am still here, there is always hope. As you share your final thoughts, tell us how you are feeling now and where you are in the journey. I feel good. Physically I am not as strong or as resilient as I was before, but I can't complain, and I feel that I am getting stronger every day. This may seem strange to some but even though it was hard, I feel like this cancer was a blessing. I was living in my own bubble of negativity and stress. I was so unhappy, something had to give, and it did. Without this experience and forced break, I would probably still be in that bubble even more miserable than I was back then. Cancer forced me to stop and look at my life differently. I did several types of therapy focused on anxiety, PTSD and on dissolving past traumas. I still work on understanding the root of my anger and bitterness and especially becoming more in tune with my feelings giving them more importance. There is always more to uncover, life brings up new opportunities for growth all the time. I feel that I am slowly moving out of what I would call 'victim mode 'into a more empowered version of myself. I am starting fresh, looking to get back to work and hopefully support others on their healing journeys. I feel like I am embracing a new version of myself, and I am excited to see what is to come. This has been fun, thanks so much chatting with me today, I really enjoyed it.
