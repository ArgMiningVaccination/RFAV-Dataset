Write in to us at parenting.care@firstcry.com A newborn's skin is soft and delicate, and there's nothing like it but a baby's skin is prone to irritation and rashes. As a parent, you're likely to worry if you notice rashes on your baby's face. But there's nothing to worry about as most facial rashes on baby's skin are harmless and tend to clear up without the need for treatment. However, if these rashes don't clear up, you may want to try some treatment. Using chemical-based creams or lotions on your baby's face to address the rashes may not be the ideal solution, hence, you could try natural ingredients, which are effective and safe. How to Cure Rashes on Baby's Face at Home Here are some home remedies that you can try to take care of your baby's skin in a safe way: 1. Oatmeal Blend Oatmeal is known to help relieve the irritation that is caused by itching on the skin. The reason behind this is that oatmeal contains Avenanthramides which are anti-inflammatory. The way to go about it is to take about one bowl of organic oatmeal with some water. Add this to a blender and grind to make a smooth paste. Apply it on the skin and remove when it has dried. However, before applying it on your baby's face directly, apply a small patch on his arm to check for an allergy. If your baby isn't allergic to oats, you can use this for treating skin rashes on his face. 2. Chamomile Tea It contains antioxidants that help in disinfecting wounds and alleviating skin rashes. Depending on the size of the rash, you may need to use one or more tea bags. Place the bags in hot water and after boiling, allow it to cool. When the water is lukewarm, take the bags out of the water and place it on your baby's face. Ensure that the tea bags are not too hot. 3. Yoghurt Skin rashes like eczema occur due to malfunctioning on the immune system. The bacteria found in yoghurt can help boost the immune system and at the same time alleviate the rash symptoms like itching. 4. Banana Peels Banana peels might be used as comic relief in many cartoons, but these are also excellent skin rash treatment tools. First, refrigerate the banana peels for about an hour or so. Then, apply a small piece to the affected area and let it do its magic. This will not only help in cleansing of the skin and moisturise it properly but make your baby feel fresh and rejuvenated. 5. Neem Neem has been used for centuries in India for its amazing benefits for the skin. It has anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory properties that help treat and alleviate skin rashes. Eczema is one skin condition that can be successfully tackled with the help of neem. You can buy neem leaves and make a paste out of it by adding water and grinding it. Apply the paste on the affected area to provide relief to your baby. 6. Aloe Vera Aloe vera is the holy grail for skin treatment which is why many creams have this as vital ingredient in it. It contains antimicrobials, anti-inflammatory, and emollient properties. While creams are available, it may also contain additives and artificial compounds that may negatively impact your baby's sensitive skin. A better alternative would be to extract the aloe vera gel from the leaves directly. These leaves can be purchased from any leading supermarket. 7. Olive Oil Olive oil is looked upon by many as a quick fix solution and for a good reason. Olive oil is a natural cleanser and does an enormous task of removing unwanted toxins and allergens from the skin. It contains an ingredient called oleocanthal which helps bring relief to any inflammation of the skin. Besides, it also contains antioxidants and Vitamin E which support the process of skin renewal and healing. 8. Cucumber They include anti-inflammatory properties that help in reducing the skin rash on the face. Due to their gentle action on even the most sensitive skin, they are preferred by many parents. Cucumbers can be blended with oatmeal to form a thick paste, which can be applied to the affected area which helps alleviate the rash symptoms. Babies have sensitive skin so avoiding over-the-counter creams with unnecessary chemicals would be a wise move. However, these home remedies have the potential to cause irritation. So you should do a small patch test on your baby's arms before trying any home remedy on his face and only after consulting a dermatologist for proper "}
