It all begins in 2003 when Julie, having owned a marketing company for more than 20 years, became friends with a Native American medicine man who ignited her passion for natural healing and became her mentor. Her personal experience with Emu oil as a pain reliever for spinal arthritis inspired her to create remedies using wild and organic holistic herbs and flowers, which expanded into a second line of vegan-friendly products with Moringa oil. Alongside her husband, Bob, and son, Peter Guerrero, this family business has raised the spirit of Emulate Natural Care to a life of its own, expanding its offerings to more than 50 different products that enhance healing, offer pain relief and rejuvenate the skin. In 2013, Emulate Natural Care received its first of several State Trade and Export Promotion (STEP) grants. The grant was used to participate in Expo Spa, the largest spa trade show in Latin and South America. As a result, with the help of the Idaho Department of Commerce (IDOC) Idaho Mexico Trade Office, Julie and Peter incorporated Emulate Naturals S de RL de CV in Guadalajara, Mexico to grow and develop the brand, expanding the offerings to spas, resorts, golf courses, Mexico's first cruise ship line and retail shops. This provided an opportunity to service the award-winning wellness resort Vidanta. Emulate Naturals works with a network of distributors and sales teams to offer certified product training and demonstrations, and private label lines. In 2017, Emulate Naturals was honored by being appointed as the U.S. Delegate for the Latin American Spa Association. The STEP grant and support from IDOC and the SBA has been significant in their growth in Mexico. This support made it possible to participate in the Governor's Trade Mission to Mexico City where they met with buyers from several major companies, participated in trade shows and developed vertical penetration of the market, increasing productivity and sales growth. Emulate has grown from two to seven people, plus several part-time employees working in commission-based sales. Revenue increased 24% in the U.S. since 2013 and about 500% in the past three years in Mexico. The company continues to develop new clients from other countries as well. A step grant and support from the Idaho Department of Commerce have enabled Emulate Natural Care to participate in a trade mission to Mexico City, increase productivity and sales, and grow its staff to seven.
