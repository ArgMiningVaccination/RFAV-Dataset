The World Health Organization estimates that 80% of the population in developing countries uses these types of remedies. Even though herbal medicine products are usually perceived as low risk, their potential health risks should be carefully assessed. Several factors can cause the toxicity of herbal medicine products: plant components or metabolites with a toxic potential, adulteration, environmental pollutants (heavy metals, pesticides), or contamination of microorganisms (toxigenic fungi). Their correct evaluation is essential for the patient's safety. The toxicity assessment of herbal medicine combines in vitro and in vivo methods, but in the past decades, several new techniques emerged besides conventional methods. The use of omics has become a valuable research tool for prediction and toxicity evaluation, while DNA sequencing can be used successfully to detect contaminants and adulteration. The use of invertebrate models (Danio renio or Galleria mellonella) became popular due to the ethical issues associated with vertebrate models. The aim of the present article is to provide an overview of the current trends and methods used to investigate the toxic potential of herbal medicinal products and the challenges in this research field.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-12-28", "cleaned_text": "Current Trends in Toxicity Assessment of Herbal Medicines: A Narrative Review [https://doi.org/10.3390/pr11010083](https://doi.org/10.3390/pr11010083) [Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Development of industry of phyto-preparations experienced a high growth rate during the last decades, leading to a wide variety of products circulating in the market, used in both alternative and complementary medicine. In the context of a high demand from consumers, there is an increased pressure to assess the efficacy of the products also to ensure their safety. The burgeoning demand was also accompanied by the escalation of the rate of fraudulent practices (e.g., the substitution of herbal material and the addition of synthetic compounds) [ [1](#B1-processes-11-00083), [4](#B4-processes-11-00083)], so standardization and quality control processes are of most importance. However, in some cases, the possible negative effects are not only attributed to adulteration, contamination, or misidentification of plant species but are related to the inherent toxicity of the plants. To address this aspect, an attentive toxicological assessment is required to eliminate potential safety concerns. Last, but not least, the adverse effects can be caused by foreign contaminants\u2014chemicals (e.g., pesticide residues, heavy metals) or microbiological [ [5](#B5-processes-11-00083)]. This review focuses on presenting the current strategies and techniques used and recommended by regulatory authorities to investigate the authenticity and toxicity of medicinal herbal products. The data collection was performed using worldwide databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Science Direct. The analyzed literature sources included original articles, review articles, and books. 2. The Importance of Standardization for Safety and Toxicity Profiling of Herbal Medicine\u2014Assuring the Herbs' Authenticity [6](#B6-processes-11-00083)]. [6](#B6-processes-11-00083)]. Juglans products. Juglans nigra contains a toxic compound (juglone), and furthermore, the contamination can be very dangerous for persons with nut allergies [ [6](#B6-processes-11-00083), [7](#B7-processes-11-00083)]. The substitution fangchi (\"guang fang ji\") in traditional Chinese medicine products may lead to renal toxicity and cancer, due to the presence of aristolochic acid, a carcinogenic and nephrotoxic agent [ [8](#B8-processes-11-00083), [9](#B9-processes-11-00083)]. Datura stramonium is a plant species frequently used in Ayurvedic medicine. In case of adulteration with Brugmansia arborea, an anticholinergic toxidrome can appear, with potentially serious outcomes for the patients [ [10](#B10-processes-11-00083), [11](#B11-processes-11-00083)]. [12](#B12-processes-11-00083)]. 2.1. Morphological Identification [13](#B13-processes-11-00083)]. 2.2. The Metabolomics in Herbal Medicinal Products Identification and Standardization-Chemical Fingerprinting [14](#B14-processes-11-00083)]. Plants produce a wide variety of phytometabolites ( [Figure 1](#processes-11-00083-f001)). The secondary metabolites play different roles in the physiology of the plants (self-defense, environmental adaptation), but they also exhibit several pharmacological actions and are active compounds used in the treatment of human diseases. Secondary metabolites can be species-specific, and their investigation can be used in the identification and quality control of herbal medicinal products [ [14](#B14-processes-11-00083), [15](#B15-processes-11-00083), metabolomics (alone or jointly with other methods) to investigate the identity and authenticity of plant species in different herbal products [ [19](#B19-processes-11-00083), [20](#B20-processes-11-00083), [21](#B21-processes-11-00083), [22](#B22-processes-11-00083)]. For example, Fukuda et al. recommend licochalcone A as a candidate biomarker to distinguish between Glycyrrhiza species [ [22](#B22-processes-11-00083)]. [Table 1](#processes-11-00083-t001)). DNA-Based Techniques for Herbal Products Authentication [4](#B4-processes-11-00083), [61](#B61-processes-11-00083), [62](#B62-processes-11-00083)]. In the USA, in 2016, the New York State Office of the Attorney General came to an agreement with herbal supplement manufacturers regarding the use of DNA barcoding during quality control stages [ [63](#B63-processes-11-00083)]. [64](#B64-processes-11-00083)]. However, the greater levels of gene tree paraphyly in plants make the task of distinguishing between species more challenging in comparison to animals [ [65](#B65-processes-11-00083)]. [16](#B16-processes-11-00083), [66](#B66-processes-11-00083)]. The standardization of the method can be achieved by creating unified databases and identification platforms [ [13](#B13-processes-11-00083)]. [66](#B66-processes-11-00083)]. [67](#B67-processes-11-00083)], for plant barcoding, the chloroplast and nuclear genomes were found to be suitable for identification, due to higher nucleotide substitution rates. Hypothetically, matK (maturase K gene) is the closest plant analogue of COI due to its high rate of evolution, but despite some successful experiments [ [68](#B68-processes-11-00083)], no single locus can be used as a universal plant barcode. The choice of barcodes represents a challenge in the authentication process, and the evaluation of the efficiency of different candidate barcodes led to the conclusion that a combination of two or more loci is preferred to single-locus for plant barcoding. However, since the three (or more)-loci approach did not show significant improvement in the species discrimination process, to avoid additional expenses, the standard barcode for land plants is the two-loci barcode approach [ [65](#B65-processes-11-00083)]. [4](#B4-processes-11-00083)]. [66](#B66-processes-11-00083)]. The Consortium for the Barcode of Life adopted the combination of chloroplast regions rbcL (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase gene) and matK (maturase K gene) as DNA barcodes for plants, but several studies have also investigated over DNA barcodes. Tnah et al. used a two-tiered approach (rbcL and trnH-psbA\u2014chloroplast intergenic spacer) for the authentication of common herbal plants in the tropics, with good species resolution [ [4](#B4-processes-11-00083)]. [69](#B69-processes-11-00083)] investigated trnH-psbA, matK, rbcL, rpoC1, as the best candidate DNA barcodes suitable for medicinal plant identification. They established that the rate of successful identification at the species level (92.7%) using ITS2 was superior to that of rbcL and matK, therefore validating ITS2 as a standard DNA barcode for plant identification [ [69](#B69-processes-11-00083)]. Their findings were also supported by Miao et al., who identified ITS2 as a universal barcode that can be used for the identification of poisonous medicinal plants found in the Chinese Pharmacopeia, with a similar rate of correct identification (92.59%) [ [13](#B13-processes-11-00083)]. The findings of other studies also support the use of ITS2 as a barcode for the identification of medicinal plant species and confirm its effectiveness. ITS2 is a short sequence (200-230 bp on average) with rapid concerted evolution [ [70](#B70-processes-11-00083), [71](#B71-processes-11-00083), [72](#B72-processes-11-00083), [73](#B73-processes-11-00083)]. However, ITS2 cannot be used for the global identification of plants due to potential intragenomic variations of ITS copies within individuals, which can cause incorrect identification of species [ [70](#B70-processes-11-00083), [74](#B74-processes-11-00083)]. [75](#B75-processes-11-00083)]. [75](#B75-processes-11-00083), [76](#B76-processes-11-00083)]. [77](#B77-processes-11-00083)]. [70](#B70-processes-11-00083)]. The mini-barcodes have the advantage of being amplified more rapidly. Furthermore, they are more diversified and allow a more accurate identification. However, the method has some major limitations (e.g., it cannot be applied for the identification of unknown adulterants/ contaminants, and the reduced length of DNA fragments can cause the loss of relevant information) [ [76](#B76-processes-11-00083)]. Several studies successfully used DNA mini-barcode for the identification of plant species in health products [ [75](#B75-processes-11-00083), [78](#B78-processes-11-00083), [79](#B79-processes-11-00083), [80](#B80-processes-11-00083), [81](#B81-processes-11-00083)]. However, in the case of authentication of highly processed herbal products, the use of analytical techniques to identify key active compounds should come to complete the data collected from DNA barcoding [ [82](#B82-processes-11-00083)]. [8](#B8-processes-11-00083), [83](#B83-processes-11-00083)]. Furthermore, symbiotic, parasitic, and pathogenic plant-fungal interactions can also affect the DNA-based identification process. When the DNA template coming from the contaminant is preferentially amplified, false conclusions can be drawn because only the contaminant DNA is detected. These shortcomings were resolved by the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods. Ivanova et al. elaborated an NGS workflow that enabled the simultaneous detection of plant and fungal DNA and can be used for quality and fungal assessment [ [83](#B83-processes-11-00083)]. [62](#B62-processes-11-00083)]. [82](#B82-processes-11-00083), [84](#B84-processes-11-00083), [85](#B85-processes-11-00083), [86](#B86-processes-11-00083), [87](#B87-processes-11-00083)]. However, the discriminatory power and the success of the identification with DNA metabarcoding is still a challenge for highly processed herbal products because of the low quality of DNA samples. Metabarcoding of multiple mini-barcode loci can represent an option cases [ [62](#B62-processes-11-00083), [88](#B88-processes-11-00083)]. [8](#B8-processes-11-00083), [16](#B16-processes-11-00083), [83](#B83-processes-11-00083), [89](#B89-processes-11-00083)]. NGS was successfully used by Zhang et al. to unambiguously differentiate between Echinacea species [ [90](#B90-processes-11-00083)]. [91](#B91-processes-11-00083), Ounjai et al. used the hybrid Bar-HRM method to distinguish between species in the Zingiberaceae family [ [93](#B93-processes-11-00083)]. Zhao et al. successfully identified Ardisia gigantifolia and its adulterants (Rhododendron molle and Intrinsic Toxicity Evaluation [1](#B1-processes-11-00083)]. The issue is even more complicated when it comes to heterogenous, complex mixtures of herbs which can cause unpredictable effects [ [137](#B137-processes-11-00083)]. [138](#B138-processes-11-00083)]. In the case of phytometabolites with proven toxic potential (as the ones mentioned above), the regulatory authorities responsible for the quality and safety of herbal medicines have imposed concentration limits. In this context, efforts were made in the field of developing technologies to remove these compounds and efficient methods to detect and assess their concentration (for example, chromatographic methods and immunoassays using monoclonal antibodies) 3.1. Acute/Sub-Acute/Chronic Toxicity Evaluation [Figure 2](#processes-11-00083-f002)), animal models are usually used. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) elaborated guidelines for testing the toxicity of chemical compounds. [142](#B142-processes-11-00083)], 90 days\u2014OECD 408 [ [143](#B143-processes-11-00083)], 12 months\u2014OECD 452 [ [144](#B144-processes-11-00083)]). Toxicity parameters like NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level), NOEL (no observed effect level), LOAEL (lowest observed adverse effect level), and LOEL (lowest observed effect level) can be determined. In the case of medicinal plants and herbal medicine, the oral route of administration is used most frequently, but dermal, intraperitoneal, and inhalation are also available. Exposure via inhalation is usually applied to essential oils, while dermal toxicity is evaluated for herbal medicinal products used in the treatment of dermatological disorders [ [145](#B145-processes-11-00083), [146](#B146-processes-11-00083), [147](#B147-processes-11-00083)]. The preferred animal species are rodents (mice or rats), but for dermal exposure, rabbits can also be and 3D cell cultures to microfluidic devices and miniature artificial organs capable of imitating key elements of human physiology (organ-on-chip systems). By integrating and connecting more organ-on-chip devices, complex systems result in body-on-chip systems that can reproduce complex interactions that take place between different organs inside the organism [ [155](#B155-processes-11-00083), [156](#B156-processes-11-00083)]. [157](#B157-processes-11-00083)]. [158](#B158-processes-11-00083), [159](#B159-processes-11-00083)]. This 3-D tissue model was previously used in medicinal plant studies and can represent a reliable method to evaluate the effect of herbal products on the integrity of the tissues, cell viability, and preservation of cilia [ [160](#B160-processes-11-00083)]. [161](#B161-processes-11-00083)]. Ng'uni et al. used this method to evaluate the irritation potential of Galenia africana [ [151](#B151-processes-11-00083)]. [162](#B162-processes-11-00083)]. [163](#B163-processes-11-00083)], the switch from conventional toxicity assessment methods is currently in a transition phase, with some obstacles to overcome [ [157](#B157-processes-11-00083)]. [Figure 4](#processes-11-00083-f004)). One advantage is the transparency of the embryos, which facilitates toxicity examinations during different developmental stages (the visualization of organogenesis is possible using fluorescence and transgenic strains) [ review, Modarresi Chahardehi et al. make an up-to-date presentation of studies that used zebrafish for toxicity screening of medicinal plants [ [164](#B164-processes-11-00083)]. Falc\u00e3o et al. also reviewed this method as an alternative to the embryotoxicity assessment of plant products [ [172](#B172-processes-11-00083)]. [173](#B173-processes-11-00083)]. 3.2. Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity Evaluation [174](#B174-processes-11-00083)], and genotoxic can be carcinogens and/or mutagens for humans. Therefore, genotoxicity testing is very important for safety assessment. The International Conference on Harmonisation (Guidance on Genotoxicity Testing and Data Interpretation for Pharmaceuticals Intended for Human Use) recommends a battery of tests for genotoxicity testing ( [Figure 5](#processes-11-00083-f005)), emphasizing that a singular test is not conclusive. There are several indicators of genotoxicity that can be analyzed: mutagenic potential (the ability to induce gene mutations), primary DNA damage, and chromosomal damage (structural and numerical aberrations) [ [175](#B175-processes-11-00083)]. [176](#B176-processes-11-00083)]. Plants belonging to and Heliotropium biosynthesize pyrrolizidine alkaloids. The compounds that contain a double bond in the molecule (e.g., retronecine, heliotridine, otonecine) can form 6,7-dihydro-7-hydroxy-1-hydroxymethyl-5H-pyrrolizine-derived DNA adducts, responsible explaining tumor induction. Other categories of genotoxic phytometabolites are represented by the alkenyl-benzenes from agents are considered pro-carcinogenic substances; they interact with DNA bases, and if the affected cells do not undergo apoptosis and continue to proliferate, carcinogenesis is initiated [ [178](#B178-processes-11-00083)]. [176](#B176-processes-11-00083), [179](#B179-processes-11-00083)]. The EFSA Scientific Committee recommends for the initial screening step a combination of two in vitro tests: the bacterial reverse mutation assay, which covers gene mutations, and the in vitro micronucleus test, which covers chromosome aberrations. If in vitro testing identifies positive genotoxic endpoints, then further in vivo testing is required. The recommended in vivo tests by EFSA are the mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus test, transgenic rodent somatic and germ cell gene mutation assays, and an in vivo Comet assay [ [180](#B180-processes-11-00083)]. [Table 3](#processes-11-00083-t003)presents a selection of genotoxicity assessment studies performed on herbal medicinal products. [207](#B207-processes-11-00083)]. On the other hand, a significant percentage of non-carcinogenic compounds gave false positive results in in vitro chromosomal damage assays due to the low specificity of the methods [ [208](#B208-processes-11-00083), [209](#B209-processes-11-00083)]. Based on these considerations, Kirkland et al. divided the chemicals into three groups\u2014the first group (\"true positives\") includes the known mutagenic carcinogens that should give positive results in in vitro genotoxicity tests; the second group (\"true negatives\") contains non-DNA reactive compounds and should give negative results, while the substances in the third group (\"false positive\") give positive results in in vitro testing, but the in vivo genotoxicity results are negative. However, some of the compounds in groups two and three can pose risks for humans, being non-genotoxic carcinogens [ [210](#B210-processes-11-00083)]. [208](#B208-processes-11-00083), [209](#B209-processes-11-00083), [211](#B211-processes-11-00083)]. [212](#B212-processes-11-00083)], was used to investigate the mutagenic potential of extracts from different medicinal plants [ [213](#B213-processes-11-00083), [214](#B214-processes-11-00083), [215](#B215-processes-11-00083)]. The combination of CometChip\u00ae and the TGx-DDI biomarker assay was used to evaluate eugenol's ability to induce DNA damage and classified the compound as a DNA damage-inducing (DDI) agent at high concentrations [ [216](#B216-processes-11-00083)]. [177](#B177-processes-11-00083)]. Furthermore, the characteristics of plants can also have an important influence on the results. For example, the Bacterial Reverse Mutation Test (Ames assay) is one of the most popular genotoxicity studies used in herbal product research. The test uses histidine-deficient bacteria (Salmonella) strains which can be converted into histidine-independent strains by mutagen compounds. But sometimes, the accuracy of these tests is questioned. Verschaeve pointed out that the high histidine content of some plants can influence the outcome of the test, generating false-positive results (the growth of the bacterial colonies can be sustained by the higher concentration of histidine available in the medium and not by histidine reverse mutation). Furthermore, some plants have antibacterial properties, which can affect bacterial growth and influence the results of the Ames test [ [217](#B217-processes-11-00083)]. [177](#B177-processes-11-00083)]. There are some examples of older studies that used animal models to investigate the carcinogenicity potential of herbal medicinal products [ [218](#B218-processes-11-00083), [219](#B219-processes-11-00083)], but currently, long-term rodent carcinogenicity testing is not frequently used for herbal products [ [220](#B220-processes-11-00083)]. A more recent study is the 2-year bioassay performed by Hoenerhoff et al., where they evaluated the hepatocellular carcinogenicity risk in mice associated with long-term consumption of Ginkgo biloba leaf extract, and found considerable evidence connecting ginkgo extracts to oncogenic events [ [221](#B221-processes-11-00083)]. Their findings were further supported by other studies [ [222](#B222-processes-11-00083), [223](#B223-processes-11-00083)]. The National Toxicology Program within the US Department of Health and Human Services also conducted several in vivo carcinogenicity studies on animal models (rodents) for herbal medicines vera, Panax ginseng, Hydrastis canadensis, Piper methysticum, Silybum marianum), and components isolated essential oils (e.g., pulegone, -thujone) [ [224](#B224-processes-11-00083), [225](#B225-processes-11-00083), [226](#B226-processes-11-00083)]. The issue of herbal medicine with genotoxic and carcinogenic potential is also emphasized by International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Aloe vera, Volume 108 of IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans (that focuses on the carcinogenicity of herbal products). They have all been classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B) [ [227](#B227-processes-11-00083)]. 3.3. Omics-Based Toxicology [1](#B1-processes-11-00083)]. The \"Omics\" approach (from the Latin \"ome\"\u2014many, a totality) relies on comprehensive, integrated evaluations [ [228](#B228-processes-11-00083)]. [Figure 6](#processes-11-00083-f006)). These technologies evaluate the outcome of the interactions between xenobiotics and living cells at different levels. The final goal is to discover the mechanisms behind the effects of a compound [ [137](#B137-processes-11-00083)]. [138](#B138-processes-11-00083)]. 3.3.1. Toxico-Transcriptomics [1](#B1-processes-11-00083)]. [229](#B229-processes-11-00083)]. There are analysis of gene expression (SAGE), microarray technologies, and sequencing technologies [ [230](#B230-processes-11-00083)]. One of the most popular techniques used is DNA microarray because it allows the simultaneous monitoring of the expression of thousands of genes, and it is accurate, specific, sensitive, and reproducible. Transcriptomics (toxico-transcriptomics) has been successfully used to elucidate the toxicological effects and mechanisms of natural compounds [ [231](#B231-processes-11-00083)]. For example, the aristolochic acid from the Aristolochia species inhibits the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) signaling in kidney cells, explaining the nephrotoxicity [232](#B232-processes-11-00083)]. Emodin, a bioactive compound from Reum palmatum, alters the expression of genes involved in the apoptosis of cancer cells, exhibiting anti-cancer properties [ [233](#B233-processes-11-00083), [234](#B234-processes-11-00083)]. But, at the same time, with the help of transcriptomics, the testicular toxicity of the compound was explained via the IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) receptor signaling pathway [ [235](#B235-processes-11-00083)]. Another category of toxic phytometabolites is pyrrolizidine alkaloids, found in species belonging to Boraginaceae, Asteraceae, and Fabaceae families. They exhibit cytotoxic, genotoxic, and carcinogenic potential. Several research teams investigated the liver and lung toxicity of these alkaloids in rats, and transcriptomics analysis revealed altered expression patterns for genes involved in DNA damage response and cell-cycle medicinal plants [ [252](#B252-processes-11-00083)]. Gelsenicine is a neurotoxic alkaloid from Gelsemium elegans (Gelsemiaceae). Huang et al. used phosphoproteomics to assess the changes in brain protein phosphorylation. Different brain regions were investigated, but the protein phosphorylation was mainly affected in the Toxico-Metabonomics [254](#B254-processes-11-00083), [255](#B255-processes-11-00083), alterations in the homeostasis and metabolic control of the organism secondary to exposure to a toxic compound. The modifications in the pattern of endogenous metabolites can provide important insight into the targettissues and the mechanism of the toxic action [ [255](#B255-processes-11-00083)]. To sum up, toxico-metabonomics has several applications: to evaluate the levels of endogenous biochemicals potentially affected by the interaction with the toxic agent, to identify the metabolites of the toxic in order to reveal the molecular mechanisms of action and to identify novel biomarkers of toxicity. NMR and MS-coupled with chromatographic techniques [ [1](#B1-processes-11-00083), [137](#B137-processes-11-00083), [256](#B256-processes-11-00083)]. [Table 4](#processes-11-00083-t004)). Sources [Figure 7](#processes-11-00083-f007)). 4.1. Mycotoxins Control [275](#B275-processes-11-00083)]. To ensure the safety of consumers, regulations for mycotoxins in herbal medicinal products were established by international organizations and agencies (World Health Organization, European Food Standards Agency, European Medicine Agency, United States Food and Drug Administration). Many research groups investigated the contamination of medicinal herbal products with mycotoxins and revealed that this subject could represent a potentially serious issue of concern because several studies found significant levels of mycotoxins above the maximum admitted gas-chromatography because no complex derivatization procedure is required during the analysis, as most mycotoxins are nonvolatile. Chromatographic methods have high specificity and sensitivity and can be used for the simultaneous determination of multiple mycotoxins [ [280](#B280-processes-11-00083), [284](#B284-processes-11-00083), [285](#B285-processes-11-00083), [289](#B289-processes-11-00083)]. However, these methods are more laborious and require several sample preparation steps (extraction and clean-up), and rapid detection technologies were developed for simpler and more convenient monitoring of the mycotoxins' contamination [ [290](#B290-processes-11-00083)]. [280](#B280-processes-11-00083), [289](#B289-processes-11-00083)]. Shim et al. used ELISA and investigated the aflatoxins levels in 70 types of herbal medicine distributed in South Korea and confirmed the potential risk to consumers applied to the investigation of mycotoxins. Chang-Bin et al. were the first to use this technique for rapid mycotoxins analysis in the field of medicinal herbal products, investigating the Chinese herb 'Mai Ya' (barley sprout, Malt) [ [280](#B280-processes-11-00083), [297](#B297-processes-11-00083)]. 4.2. Pesticides and Fumigation Agent Residues Control [298](#B298-processes-11-00083)]. Several studies revealed the presence of these contaminants in herbal products. The most studied types of products are Asian herbal medicines. To ensure the safety of consumers, Maximum Residual Levels (MRLs) were established for pesticides [ [299](#B299-processes-11-00083)]. Wang et al. analyzed 1017 samples of 10 Chinese herbal medicines and determined 168 pesticides. Of the analyzed samples, 76.0% contained multiple residues, and only 10.8% were residue-free. However, they did not classify the potential health risk associated with the consumption of these products as high [ [300](#B300-processes-11-00083)]. [Table 5](#processes-11-00083-t005)[ [301](#B301-processes-11-00083), [323](#B323-processes-11-00083), [324](#B324-processes-11-00083)]. To expand the number of compounds analyzed simultaneously in a single step, pesticide biochips were also designed [ [325](#B325-processes-11-00083)]. These technologies are widely used in environmental analyses, but they can be successfully applied to medicinal plants or other herbal medicines. 4.3. Heavy Metals Control [326](#B326-processes-11-00083)]. [327](#B327-processes-11-00083), Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES), and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) are used for the quantification of heavy metal contamination [ [330](#B330-processes-11-00083), [331](#B331-processes-11-00083), [332](#B332-processes-11-00083), [333](#B333-processes-11-00083), [334](#B334-processes-11-00083), [335](#B335-processes-11-00083)]. Luo et al. used ICP-MS and determined cadmium, lead, arsenic, mercury, and copper in 1773 extract samples from 86 different kinds of herbal medicines. Most products were within acceptable risks, but there were samples where at least one heavy metal was detected to be over the maximum acceptable limit. The authors also pointed out the higher risks associated with As contamination and recommended improved monitoring activity [ [328](#B328-processes-11-00083)]. 5.
