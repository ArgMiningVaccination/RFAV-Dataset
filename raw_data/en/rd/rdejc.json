Springtime is here and the sun is finally out. All indications should be that it's time to get ahead and get outside, but that can be hard to do if you feel bloated, get overheated easily, have fatigue that is not relieved by sleep, or insomnia. These and other symptoms may all be signs that it's time to do a purification cleanse. In traditional Chinese Medicine, the best time to cleanse is during the spring. It's the season analogous to the Liver, which is \"the Emperor of Detoxification\" and is especially responsive to purging toxins during this time of year. The great thing about a purification cleanse is that you can start by doing it just once a year, so why not look into it now? We also don't believe in starving yourself to cleanse, rather change your food choices to help eliminate toxins we ingest every day without realizing. Seriously, you will notice a difference in mood, productivity, and weight in a few short weeks. Our Approach to A Purification Cleanse The word \"cleanse\" can have a daunting connotation, but we like to think of it as a \"time out\" for your body. A purification cleanse is a time where you can choose nutritious foods, create some real downtime at home, and get into a healthier routine with your chosen form of fitness. What you put into the cleanse; you will get an even better return when you complete it! Our purification cleanse program integrates the 21-Day Standard Process Purification Program. Which means no food deprivation! The program utilizes whole food supplements; whole, organic, and unprocessed food; and water to cleanse the body so that you can have more energy, maintain a healthy weight, and improve your digestion. In addition to the program, we recommend acupuncture to help detoxify the liver and other organs, massage to move the lymph and to assist the liver to remove toxins, as well as individualized herbal remedies that can assist with the effects of the purification. This is a time to focus on you so you can be the best version of yourself every day! The idea is to take one month to create new habits that stick for the rest of the year. It doesn't have to be a ton of habits, but one or two new healthy habits can change everything!
