Summary The Panel n otes at the o utset that this case appears to be unique, a nd its circum stances are unlikely ever to be repeated. It has proved partic ularly nettlesom e, involving as it does an earlier AAA Panel Decision, m ade in 2001 under a prior set of IAAF code provisi ons. That earlier 2001 AAA Panel rendered what appear s to be an interim , non-final decision pending disposition of a petition for reinstatem ent by the IAAF. W hen the IAAF reinstated Mr. Gatlin in 2002, the 2001 AAA Panel did not resum e its deliberations, nor render a final deci sion, nor in any way Page 1 of 53 modify its initial decision, fi nding a doping violation and im posing a 2 year suspension on Mr. Gatlin for what the Pan el found, and evidently th e IAAF found was a completely inad verten t, unintentional violation w hich woul d have been avoided through the sim ply step of seeking perm ission for the use of a therapeutic, prescription m edication1. Nevertheless, the 2001 AAA Panel found a doping vio lation, Mr. Gatlin, and all of his witnesses cons istently testif ied that they cons idered and und erstood that finding to co nstitu te a first doping v iolation. At no tim e did Mr. Gatlin claim it was not a violation, nor did he present any evidence th at it was not a finding of a first doping violation. Nevertheless, the Panel found itself constrai ned by its obligations to consider the implications on the present case, of the findings or lack of findings in that 2001 decision. Turning to the present case, the Panel finds that the evidence presented supports a finding that M r. Gatlin comm itted a doping v iolation in 2006, nam ely the use of exogenous testosterone, which was detected in his system on or about April 22, 2006. The Panel further finds that Mr. Gatlin f ailed to susta in his burden of proof to show how the Prohibited Su bstance ente red his body, in order to rely upon a claim of no fault, or no significant fault in connection with the 2006 doping violation. The doping violation wh ich was establishe d by the proofs herein, was M r. Gatlin 's second doping violation, the first having occurred in 2001 while Mr. Gatlin was a student at the University of Tennessee2. Since that finding m eant that the p resent m atter constitu tes a second 1 This Pan el notes that the 2001 AAA Panel expressly r etained jurisdiction over the first offense and did not subsequently relinquish that jurisdiction. 2 The Dissent hereing makes an impassi oned case that the facts and circumstances of that first offense, namely the advice o f the USATF an d USADA th at it was su fficien t for athletes sim ply to discontinue their non- competitio n use of m edicatio ns, and law, namely th e Am ericans with Disab ilities Act and Swiss Law, co mpel the conclusion that Mr. Gatlin essen tially h ad no fau lt at all in the first o ffense. The Dissen t does not explain, then, wh y that first panel found a doping violation . If the stand ard in 20 01 was simply negligence, an d Mr. Gatlin was not neglige nt beca use the actions and advice of the USATF and USADA had to be considered as part of the anti-doping Page 2 of 53 violation and additional potential penalties be considered, the Pane l considered arguments of Mr. Gatlin that the first v iolation should not be c ounted and USADA's to the contrary. Despite the argum ents of Mr. Gatlin, detailed m ore fully he reinbelow, the re is no evidence before the Panel which would sustai n the argum ent that th e first doping violation should not be considered and that the current doping violation was, therefore, effectively a first violation. Mr. Gatlin's period of in eligibility w ill be four (4 ) years from May 26, 2006 ( thirty (3 0) days following the date on which his urine sam ple was taken). He is disqualified from and forfeits any and all competi tive results, if any, received on or subsequent to April 22, 2006 through the end of his period of ineligibility. While the P anel has held that it has no basi s upon which to ignore the first finding of a doping violation, for the reasons discussed below , we adjure the Internat ional Am ateur Athletic Federation (\"IAAF\") to determ ine whether, in the exercise of its discretion, if its decision reins tating Mr. Gatlin in 2002 and elim inating a ny further ban from competition sh ould be held to have been based on or the equivalent of a finding that he had no contributing fault in connection with his firs t doping vi olation. Sim ilarly, M r. Gatlin m ay to present eviden ce that the anti-doping auth orities in 20 01 affir matively rep resented to M r. Gatlin that cessation of use thre e days prior to c ompetition would be suf ficient complianc e with the ru les, an d theref ore the first panel, which has never relinquished ju risdiction over that offense would have found \"no fault..\" If either be the case , then it ought not be counted for purposes of the present award, and the Panel will retain jurisdiction over the award se t out hereinbelow to adjust that award should a decision of the IAAF, or subsequently di scovered facts or events so warrant. rules or an interpretatio n of tho se rules, th en the approp riate conclusion would, it appears to the majority, have been a finding of no doping offense. However, that was not the case. Page 3 of 53 As will be more fully discussed below, the Panel notes that no AAA or CAS Panel has ruled that p roceedings b y Anti-Doping Organi zations are sub ject to the A mericans with Disabilities Act or com parable Swiss laws tha t prohibit d iscrimination against the disabled. Given the ab ject failure o f Mr. Gatlin to suppor t his mere generalized statem ent about those laws, this Panel likewise does not ha ve to rule on that issue as it wa s not properly presented to it. We do note that the task of this Panel is m ade more difficult by the com plexity caused by those statutes, which have not been expl ored in detail before this P anel. The D issent presents detailed argum ent and citation as to why thos e statu tes sho uld be cons idered and thereby either invalidate the 2001 AAA Panel decision, or prohibit its cons ideration. Had Mr. Gatlin presented such argum ents, or indeed virtually any argum ents, th ey would have been considered by the Panel but the Panel m akes no conclusions as to the outcom e had he done so. 2. Parties 2.1 Claim ant, USADA, is the independent anti-doping agency for Olym pic Sports in the United S tates and is responsible for conductin g drug tes ting and any ad judication of positiv e test resu lts pursuant to th e United Sta tes An ti-Doping Agency Protocol f or Olym pic Movem ent Testing, Effective as Revised August 13, 2004 (\"USADA Protocol\"). 2.2 The Respondent, Justin Gatlin, is a m ember of the USA Track & Field, Inc. (\"USATF\").3 He is the 2005 W orld and USA Out door 100m and 200m Olym relay silver m edalist. 3. Jurisdiction 3 USATF is th e Natio nal Governing Bod y (\"NGB\") for track and filed, long -distan ce running and race walk ing in the Un ited States. It is a m ember of th e International Amateur Athletic Federatio n (\"IAAF\"). Page 4 of 53 3.1 This Panel has jurisdiction over this doping dispute pursuant to the Ted S tevens Olym pic and Am ateur Sports Act (\"Act\") \u00a72205 21 because this is a controversy invo lving Respondent's opportunity to participate in na tional and internationa l competition for his NGB. The Act states: An amateur sports organi zation is eligib le to b e recogniz ed, or to continue to be recognized, as a national governing body only if it . . . a grees to sub mit to binding arbitration in any controversy involving . . . the opportunity of any amateur athlete . . . to participate in amateur athletic co mpetition, upon demand of . . . any aggrieved amateur athlete. . ., conducted in accordance with the Commer cial Rules of the Ameri can Arbitration Association, as modified and provided for in the corporation's constitution and bylaw s. . .

Page 5 of 53 provides tha t hearings re garding dop ing dis putes \"will take place in the United States before the A merican Arbitration Association (\"A AA\") using the supplementary Procedures.\"8 3.5 Mr. Gatlin entered into a voluntary agreem ent on July 25, 2006, not to compete pending further notice. 3.6 Thereafter, apparently following exte nded discussions between the parties, USADA filed the present acti on, seeking im position of sanc tions, on February 20, 2007. The parties selected the dates of July 30 through August 1, 2007 as hearing dates. T he hearing adjourned on August 1, 2007, but was not closed until rece ipt of the hearing transcript. The transcript was received on August 20, 2007 and the hearing closed. Thereafter, f ollowing consider ation of argum ents m ade dur ing the hearing, the Panel reopened the hearing in order to provide the pa rties with the opportunity to brief specific issues further and to provide additional eviden ce in support of their respective positions. The parties indicated that they could not act within the window of opportunity provided by the Panel, and sought additional tim e within which to do so. On August 13, 2007 through October 22, 2007, the Panel held discussi ons with the parties regarding the open issues and received the supplem ental briefs and supplem ental reply briefs of the parties. After consid ering wheth er the p arties had m et the Panel's re quest f or information to the extent they were able to do so9, the h earing was again clo sed on Decem ber 21, 2007. 4. FACT UAL BACKGROUND a. Present Case 8 The supplem entary procedures re fer to the American Ar bitration Association Supplementary Procedures for the Arbitration of Olympic Sport Doping Disputes, as a pproved by the USOC's Athletes' Advisory and NGB Councils. 9 While the Pa nel did not recei ve all the information it had hoped to receive , it appea rs that the parties provided that which they could , and therefore the Pa nel cl osed t he rec ord. Page 6 of 53 4.1 The parties s tipulated to a s ubstantial portion of the facts re levant to this dispute. The stipu lated facts that are adop ted by this Pa nel as its factual findings are as follows: (i) on April 22, 2006 at the Kansas Relays, Mr. Gatlin gave the urine sam ple designated by USADA a s USADA s pecim en number 4960404 (\"Sam mple colle ction and proc essing or USADA spe cimen num ber 496040 was c onducted appropriately and without error; (iii) the chain of custody for USADA specim en num ber 496040 from the tim e of collection and processing at the collection site to the re ceipt of the sam ple by the World Anti-Doping Agency accredited laborat ory at the University of California in Los Angeles (\"UCLA Laboratory\") wa s conducted appropriately and w ithout error; (iv) the UCLA Laboratory's chain of custody for USADA specim en number 496040 was conducted appropriate ly and without error; (v) the UC LA Laboratory, through accepted scientific p rocedures and without error, accu rately de termined by carb on isotope ratio an alysis the sam ple positiv e for the finding of the substance testosterone or its precursors, which are prohibited as an androgenic anabolic agent under th e applicable rules, in both the A and B bottles of USADA specim en number 496040 (\"Positiv e Test\"); and (vi) this Positive Test is a doping offe nse in violation of the WADA Code and IAAF Rules; 4.2 The parties further stipulated to eriod of a m aximum of eight (8) yea rs beginning o n August 15, 2006, with credit being given for th e tim e Mr. Gatlin has served a provisional suspension be ginning on July 25, 2006. Mr. Gatlin reserves the right to argu e for an earlier start date under WADA Code Article 10.8 because h is A sa mple was not repo rted to him until Jun e 15, 2006; (ii)That by accepting the test resu lts findi ng the p resence of \"testosterone or its precursors\" in both the A and B sa mple of USADA specim en number 496040, Mr. Gatlin is in no way adm itting th at the p resence of any such substanc e was the result of any knowing actions by M r. Gatlin to cause such sub stances to be present in his body. USADA expressly unde rstands and agrees that Mr. Gatlin expressly reserves his right to argue \"ex ceptional circum stances\" as defined under the applicable rules (Article 10.5.1 an d 10.5.2 of the W ADA Code), including being able to argue that Mr. Gatlin had \" no fault\" or that he had \"no significant fault; Page 7 of 53 (iii) Tha t Mr. Gatlin will be disqua lified from and f orfeits any and all competitive results, if any, received on or subsequent to April 22, 2006, the date that U SADA specim en number 496040 was collected through the end of this period of ineligibility. Mr. Gatlin reserv es his ri ght to argue a differe nt outcom e concerning the disqualif ication of his results und er WADA Code Article 10.7 based on his attem pt to argue \"exceptiona l circumstances\" as defi ned under the applicable rules (Article 10.5.1 and 10.5.2 of the W ADA Code), including his argum ents that Mr. Gatlin had \"no fault\" had \"no significant fault\" with respe ct to the Positive T est; (iv) Tha t Mr. Gatlin ha s and will con tinue to coo perate with and provide assis tance to USADA and express ly reserves his right to argue that he had provided \"substantial assistan ce\" as define d under the applicable ru les (Article 10.5.3 of the W ADA Code); (v) That the eight-year s anction agreed to by the parties is a m aximum penalty and that nothing herein shal l preclud e either USADA fr om recomm ending or Mr. Gatlin f rom seeking a les ser pena lty or no penalty. The parties agree that USADA is not obligated to seek lesse r sanction and that USADA m ay at all times, in all proceed ings, argue th at eight (8) years is the appropriate sanction. USADA expressly ackn owledges an d agrees that the m aximum penalty of eight years ag reed to by the part ies does take into account the facts and circum stances surrounding Mr. Gatlin's positiv e test as reflected in USADA v. Gatlin (AAA 30 190 00546 01), but does not take into account any assistance that Mr. Gatlin m ay provide to USADA, the IAAF, WADA or any other entity, including the United States governm ent, engaged in the investigation of an ti-doping rule violations by athletes, coaches, or others; (vi) Tha t Mr. Gatlin rese rves the ri ght to con test the eight-yea r sanction recomm ended by USADA and if he chooses to do so, will be required to subm it the m atter to arbitra tion no late r than six (6) m onths from the date of this stipulation, unless both partie s agree there is good cause to extend such deadline (this paragraph supersedes paragr aph 10 of the USADA Protocol); 4.3. The Panel conducted a hearing on Ju ly 30, 2007 through August 1, 2007. After receipt and review of the heari ng transcript along with the exhib its placed in evidence by the parties, th e Panel was n ot persuad ed by the evid ence and a rguments subm itted by Mr. Gatlin tha t he should be held to have had no fault, or no si gnificant fault, in conne ction with the present doping violation. Specifically, Mr. Gatlin p resents no evid ence from which the Pan el could determ ine the source of the exogenous test osterone which was found in his system . Page 8 of 53 4.4 However, the Panel further found that it was not satisfied with the evidence or argum ents presented by either pa rty regarding how the Panel s hould treat Mr. Gatlin's first doping violation, and sp ecifically the issue of Mr. Gatlin 's faul t or neg ligen ce in his firs t violation. On August 13, 2007, the Panel issued an order reopen ing the hearing and requesting further briefing on the issue of Mr. Gatlin's fault in the first violat ion. In part, the order stated the followin g: . . . . The May 1, 2002 decision in the first offence, did not m ake a determination of fault. In the Panel's view, a decision on the iss ue of fault in the f irst case is critica l to its delibe rative process. Th e Panel has no intention of retrying the first case. The P anel is m erely looking to fill in the blanks of the first case g iven its procedural history of not com ing to a fi nal decision on the issue of fault. (b) First doping violation - 2001 4.4 On June 16 and 17, 2001, Mr. Gatlin was drug tes ted by USADA at the USATF Junior National Cham pionships. As a result of this in-com petition drug test, Mr. Gatlin's urine samples were decla red positive for the stim ulant a mphetam ine.10 This cons tituted a pos itive test under the IAAF rules at that tim e. Pursuant to the Act, an AAA panel was designated to conduct a hear ing re garding this positiv e dru g test. 4.5 Mr. Gatlin and USADA entered in to a stipulation regarding a su bstantial po rtion of the facts surrounding the 2001 positive test. Th e stipulated facts were inserted into the decision and findings of the 2001 AAA Pane l which are summ arized below: (i) Mr. Gatlin was a 19 year-old college student who attended the University of Tennessee on a track scholarship. He was suffering from a medical condition known as attention deficit disorder (\"ADD\"). He was first diagnosed with this condition in 1991 when he was nine years old and he was taking this m edication up until the tim e of the hearing in 20 01.11 10 Gatlin v. USADA , AAA No. 30 santidoping.org/files/ activ e/arb itratio n_rulings/arbitration_ruling_5_14_2002_Gatlin .pdf 11 Gatlin, sup ra, at page 2. Page 9 of 53 (ii) He was diagnosed w ith ADD afte r a thorough m edical evaluation. His treating physician determ ined he would be nefit from prescription m edicine. He was regularly evaluated by his treating physician from 1991 to the date of the 2001 hearin g and his prescrip tions were ad justed as needed to treat h is condition in ligh t of side effects an d efficacy. For the five year period preced ing th e 2001 hearing, his treating physician s prescribed Adderall for hi s disability. Adderall contains the am pheta mine wh ich cau sed the pos itive te st. 12 An athlete can take amphetam ines outsid e of com petition . (iv) An international panel of m edical experts m utually selected by USADA and Mr. Gatlin r eviewed Mr. Gatlin 's medical f ile an d agreed with the diagno sis of his treating physician. The in ternational panel a lso agreed with the tre atment prescribed f or Mr. Gatlin. 13 (v) Mr. Gatlin stopped taking his m edicat ion several days before his first in- competition test. At the tim e he was enro lled in s ummer school. He was taking two summer school classes which he needed to su ccessfully com plete in o rder to satisfy requirem ents for his scholarship. He had m id-term exam s in these courses the week of June 11, 2001, the week prior to the com petition in which he tested positiv e.14 (vi) Mr. Gatlin took his pres cription m edicine to study for m id-term s. He did not want to have the m edication in his sy stem at the tim e of the com petition b ecause it made him feel \"sluggish\" and unable to run as w ell. He did not take his medication f or thre e day s prior to th e com petition . He did not f eel the ef fects of his m edicine and he believed that it had cleared his system . He was unaware that there was s till the possib ility that d etectable am ounts of the medicin e could exist in his urine.15 (vii) As it turned out, his m edicine had not com pletely clea red his system . Sm all amounts of am pheta mine, less than [20] nanogram s per m illiliter of urine was detected in the urine sample he prov ided on June 16, 2001. The sam ple he gave the next day on June 17, 2001 contained even smaller am ounts. These decreasing amounts we re found to be consistent w ith Mr. G atlin having stopped taking his medication on or about June 13, 2001, three da ys before he ran in the com petition in which he tested positive.16 (viii) The course of action followed by most athletes with ADD is sim ply to discontinue their m edication in advan ce of a competition. USADA advised athletes after consultation with thei r physicians to discontinue using the ADD medication prior to competition in order fo r the medication to clear their system . 12 Id. at page 2. 13 Id. at pages 2 and 3. 14 Id. at page 3, \u00b64. 15 Id. at page 3, \u00b65. 16 Id. at page 3, \u00b65. Page 10 of 53 (ix) Mr. Gatlin neither cheated nor inte nded to cheat. He did not intend to enhance his perform ance nor, given his medical condition, did his m edication in fact enhance his performance. 4.6 The IAAF Rule 60 (2)(a)(i) in effect at that tim e, required that the panel impose a sanction of two years on Mr. Ga tlin f or this f irst of fense regardless of any mitigating circumstances . That is, there was no provi sion at that tim e for a finding of \"no fault\" or of \"no significant fault.\" 4.7 The IAAF rules did provide, however, that in the case of \"exception al circum stances\" an athlete m ay apply to the IAAF Council for re-instatem ent be fore the two-year period of ineligibility expired.\"17 Under the IAAF rules in effect in 2001, only the IAAF Counc il could make finding of facts and a decision re garding \"exception al circum stances.\" 4.8 Regarding the provision that only the I AAF could m ake findings of facts and a decision on the issue of \"exceptional circ umstances,\" the 2001 AAA Panel found \"som e independent review of the IAAF Coun cil's decision m ust be available.\"18 For this reaso n the AAA Panel im posed a two-year period of ineligib ility based on Mr. Gatlin's first offense to allow Mr. G atlin to petition the IAAF Council fo r early reinstatem ent, which could not be done until the 2001 AAA Panel issued its ruli ng. That AAA Panel further held: This Panel h ereby r etains full jur isdiction ove r this case so th at it m ay reconsider the two-year suspension which it as impos ed by this order should the IAAF not take expeditious action in granting Mr. Gatlin e arly reinstatem ent to a term appropriate to his circumstances and satisfactory to Mr. Gatlin. 19 4.9 Thereaf ter, Mr. Gatlin p etitioned the IAAF Council for early reins tatem ent. The 17 IAAF Rule 60 (8 ) (2000). 18 Gatlin, supra, at page 9, \u00b66. 19 Gatlin, sup ra, at page 8, \u00b65. Page 11 of 53 IAAF found \"exceptional circum ted and imm ediately granted Mr. Gatlin reinstatem ent. There is no written decision from the I AAF Council m aking a finding on the issue of Mr. Gatlin 's fault or neg ligen ce. 4.10 Further, the AAA Panel expres sly did not m ake a finding on th e issue of Mr. Gatlin's fault or negligence20. The 2001 AAA Panel observed: While Mr. Gatlin m ay have violated the I AAF anti-doping rules in that he did not first seek an exem ption from the IAAF fo r his m edication before he com peted, he certainly is not a doper. This Panel w ould characterize M r. Gatlin 's inadverten t violation of the IAAF's rules based on uncontested facts as, at most, a \"technical\" or a \"paperwork\" violation. As such, the seriou sness of Mr. Gatlin 's co nduct and his personal culpability are open to dis pute and are certainly proportionately very much less than other athletes who would receive a two-year suspension under the same IAAF rules. Were this Pane l to address the issue of culp ability and sanctions in a f ull eviden tiary hear ing, this Panel clearly would not apply the full two-year suspension to Mr. Gatlin .21(emphasis added.) 5. RULES AP PLICABLE TO THE PRESENT DISPUTE As the parties have agreed that there is a present doping violation th e rules rela ted to th e outstanding issues in this case are under the m andatory provisions of the WADA Code22: 2.1 [Doping is]The presence of a Prohibite d Substance or it s Metabo lites or Markers in an Athlete's bodily Specim en. 2.1.1 It is each Athlete's personal duty to ensure that no Prohibited Substance enters his or her body. Athletes are res ponsible for any Prohibited Substance or its Metabolites or Marker s found to be present in their bodily Specim ens. Accordingly, it is not necessary that in tent, fault, negligence or knowing Use on 20 The Disse nt argue s that t he failure by the 2001 AAA Pa nel to make an affirmative find ing as to fault, compels th is Pan el to find \"no fault.\" The majority resp ectfully disagrees that the absence of a finding - which the Dissent agrees was not required in 2001 - is the legal equivalent of a finding of \"no fault\" under the 2006 standard. It is this gap, however, wh ich compelled the Pan el to examine that prior de cision over the strenuous obj ectio ns of USADA. 21 Gatlin, su pra, at pages 7-8, \u00b6\u00b62,3. 22 Mr. Gatlin has spent a great deal o f time and effort arg uing that un der the as yet no t adopted 2007 pro posed revisions to the WAD A Code, the decision of the Panel would be impacted and that the period of suspension would be differen t than under the curren t Code. (See, e.g , Gatlin Prehearing brief at 21 -22). Howev er, this Panel must apply the Cod e as it is presen tly in effect , not a Cod e which may o r may not be adopted at some time in the future, in the presen t form or in an as yet unknown form . Page 12 of 53 the Athlete's part be demons trated in order to establ ish an anti-doping violation under Article 2.1. 3.1 Burdens and Standards of Proof. The Anti-Doping Organization shall have the burden of establishing that an anti- doping rule violation has occurred. The st andard of proof s hall be whether the Anti-Doping Organization has established an anti-doping rule violation to the comfortable satisfaction of the hearing body bearing in mind the seriousness of the allegation which is m ade. This standard of proof in all cases is greater than a mere balance of probability but less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Where the Code places the burden of proof upon the Athlete or other Person alleg ed to ha ve comm itted an anti-do ping rule vio lation to a presum ption or estab lish sp ecified facts or circum stances , the standard of proof shall be by a balance of probability. 3.2 Methods of Establishing Facts and Presumptions. Facts related to anti-doping rule violati ons m ay be established by any reliable means, including adm issions. The following rules of proof shall be applicable in doping cases. . . . 10.2 Imposition of Ineligibility for Pr ohibited Substances and Prohibited Methods Except for the specified substances inde ntified in Article 10.3, the period of Ineligibility im posed for a violation of Articles 2. 1 (prese nce of Prohibited Substance or its Metabolites or Makers). . . First violation: Two (2 ine ligibility. Second violation : Lifetim e Ineligibility However, the Athlete or other Person sh all have the opportunity in each case, before a per iod of Ineligibility is im posed, to es tablish th e bas is for elim inating o r reducing this sanction as provided in Article 10.5. 10.5 Elimin ation or Reduction of Period of In eligibility B ased on Exceptional Circumstan ces. 10.5.1 No Fault or Negligence If the Athle te estab lishes in an individual case involving an anti-doping rule violation under Article 2.1 (Prese nce of Prohibited Substance or its Metabolites or Makers) or Use of a Pr ohibited S ubstance or Prohibited Method under Article 2.2 that he or she bears No Fault or Negligence fo r the violation, the otherwise ap plicab le period of Ineligibility sha ll be elim inated . When a Page 13 of 53 Prohibited S ubstance or its Markers or Me tabolites is detected in an Athle te's Specim en in violation of Article 2.1 (P resence of Prohibited S ubstance). T he Athlete m ust also estab lish how the Pr ohibited S ubstance entered his or her system in order to have the period of Inel igibility elim inated. In the ev ent this Artic le is ap plied and th e period of Ineligibility otherwise ap plicab le is eliminated, the anti-doping rule violation shall not be consider ed a violation for the Lim ited purpose of determ ining the period of Ineligibility f or multiple violations under Article 10.2, 10.3 and 10.6. 10.5.2 No Significant F ault or Negligence This Article 10.5.2 applies only to an ti-doping rule viol ations involving Article 2.1 (Presence of Prohibited S ubstan ce or its Metabolites or Markers), Use of Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method un der Article 2 .2, failing to subm it to Sam ple collection under Article 2 .3, or adm inistration of a Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method under Article 2.8. If an Athlete establishes in an individual case involving such violations that he or sh e bears No Significant Fault or Negligen ce, then the pe riod of Ineligibility m ay be reduced, but the reduced period of Ineligibility m ay not be less than one-half of the m inimum period of Ineligibility otherwise ap plicab le. If the otherwise applicable period of Ineligibility is a lifetim e, the reduced period under this section m ay be no less than 8 years. W hen a Prohibited Substa nce o r its Markers or Metabo lites is detected in an Athlete's Specim en in violation of Article 2.1 (Presence of Prohibited S ubstance), the Athlete must also establish how the Prohibited Substance entered his or her system in or der to have the period of Ineligibility reduced. 10.5.3 Athlete's Substantial Assistance in Discovering or Establishin g Anti- Doping Rul e Violations by Athl ete Support Personnel and Others. An Anti-Doping Organization m ay also reduc e the period of Ineligibility in an individual case where the Athlete has provided substant ial as sistan ce to the Anti- Doping Organization w hich results in th e Anti-Doping Organization discovering or establishing an anti-doping rule violation by another Person involving Possession under Article 2.6.2 (Possession by Athlete Support Personnel), Article 2.7 (Trafficking), or Article 2.8 (Adm inistr ation to an Athlete). The reduced period of Ineligibility m ay not, however, be less than one-half of the m inimum period of Ineligibility o therwise app licable . If the otherwise applicable period of Ineligibility is a lifetim e, the reduced period under this section m ay be no less than 8 years. 10.7 Disqualification of Results in Co mpetitions Subsequent to Samp le Collect ion. In addition to the autom atic Disqualif ication of the results in the Com petition which produced the positive Sam ple under Article 9 (Autom atic Disqualif ications Page 14 of 53 of Individual Results), all other com petitive results obtained from the date a positiv e Sample was collec ted (whe ther In-Competition or O ut-of-Com petition), or other doping violation occurred, th rough the commence ment of any Provisional Suspension or Ineligibility period, shall, unless fairness requires otherwise, be Disqualif ied with all of the resulting c onsequences including forfeiture of any medals, points and prizes. 10.8 Commencement of Ineligibility Period. The period o f Ineligib ility shall s tart on the date of the hearing decision providing for Inelig ibility or, if the hearing is waiv ed, on the date Ineligibility is ac cepted o r otherwise imposed. Any period of Provi sional Suspension (whether imposed or voluntarily accepted ) shall be credited agains t the total period of Ineligib ility to be served. W here required by fairness, such as delays in the hearing process or other aspects of Doping Control not attributable to the Athlete, the body im posing the sanction m ay start the period of Ineligibil ity at a n earlier d ate comm encing as early as the date of Sample collection. 6. Gatlin's Ar guments in the Present Case 6.1 Regarding his secon d violation, Mr. Gatlin alleges his po sitive test was the result of sabotage. H e speculated that his physical th erapist m ight have rubbed cream spiked with testosterone on his legs without his knowledge the night bef ore and the day of drug testing on April 22, 2006. He asserted that he exercised \"utm ost caution\" in attem pting to keep prohibited substances out of his system . Therefore, he argues that under 10.5.1, this Panel should find for Mr. Gatlin u nder the No Fault or Neg ligence stan dard of care. 6.2 Mr. Gatlin points out that he supporte d USADA's efforts and served as its anti- doping spokesperson in 200523, and that he has been tested 35 tim es, before and after the 2006 positiv e test at the Kans as relay s, and argues fr om that, that th e 2006 tes t was an aberration, demonstrating that the 2006 test must have been from sabotage. 23 The Pan el finds Mr. Gatlin 's serv ice commendable, bu t not prob ative of the presen t issu es, other than USADA app arently ag reed with the 2001 AAA Pan el decision that Mr. Gatlin was \"no t a doper\" and did not intend to cheat, an d had not cheated through use of the ADD m edicatio n for which he tested po sitive at th e time. Page 15 of 53 6.3 Mr. Gatlin reques ts that this Pan el disregard comments to 10.5.2 which preclude a Panel from finding \"No Fault or Negligence\" when an athlete is sabotaged by a coach, physical therapist, or spouse. 6.4. Mr. Gatlin argues that, by showing that he did not adm inister the testosterone to himself, he has satisfied the provision of the W ADA Code 10.5.1 which requires that the athlete show how the substance got into his system . He alleg es that while he has produced no direct evidence to show how the testoste rone got into his system , or even that the cream applied by his trainer was even spiked at all, he has elim inated all possible explanati ons for how the prohibited substance got into his system , except by sabotage. Thus, he argues, he has proved his case by elimination. 6.5 Mr. Gatlin also m akes a back up argum ent for why an eight (8) year or life-tim e ban under WADA Code10.2 is inappropr iate, in the event that the Panel finds he did not carry his burden of showing \"no fault\" in his 2006 dopi ng violation. Na mely, Mr. Gatlin argues that the eight (8) year sanction sought by USADA should be reduced be cause he has provided prom pt and extraord inary as sistance to th e United St ates Rev enue Service's crim inal investigation regarding dopi ng in sport. 6.6 USADA has argued in response that the WADA Code's Article 10.5 requires that the ath lete's assis tance m ust \"result in the An ti-Doping Organization disc overing or establishing an anti-doping rule violation by another Person. . .\", and that Mr. Gatl in's assistance, as extens ive as it m ay have been, failed to m eet that test. M r. Gatlin respond ed that such a limitation is dif ficult to impossible to meet and is particula rly prejud icial to innocent v ictims. The Panel finds m uch merit in Mr. Gatlin's posi tion and the facts of his cooperation, which were substantiated by the pertinent gove rnment witness, supports the extensive, voluntary and unique Page 16 of 53 nature of Mr. Gatlin 's assistan ce. Th e fact tha t the assis tance has not, to d ate, resulted in conviction of another is not the responsibil ity of Mr. Gatlin in this instance. 6.7 Mr. Gatlin also argues that in any case wh ere an athlete is faced with a life-tim e ban, the Panel should be extraordinaril y vigilant in reviewing the ci rcum stances of both violations, rather than m erely applying by rote, a first o ffense/second of fense calculation. The P anel is cognizan t of the severity of the ban faced by Mr. Gatlin, bu t it is the am biguity of the first doping violation holding and result which compelled th is Panel to co nsider the c ircum stances of the 2001 decision in this case, ra ther than m erely the severi ty of the potential award. 6.8 In attacking any reliance on his first viola tion as a basis for finding the present case to be a second violation, Mr. Gatlin fi rst argues it is too old and too in significant to count as a first offense. He argues that the WADA Code is somehow unfair in that it does not im pose a tim e limit on the inte rval be tween the f irst violation and the second viol ation, as m ay be the case in other legal settings. For exam ple, Mr. Ga tlin a sserts this Panel shou ld consider the requirem ents of the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines ( \"Guideline s\") Manual f or criminal cas es, to determ ine an appropriate sanction for Mr. Gatlin 's second violation. The Panel re jects this con tention.24 6.9 Mr. Gatlin further argued that the Guidelines lim it the duration of time an offense of a juvenile can be considered to five (5) years. He as serts tha t because th e first even t was in the 2001 U.S. Junior Nationals, an age restricted ev ent, Mr. Gatlin, though 19 at the tim e, should be considered a m inor for the purposes of the Pa nel's evaluation under the G uidelines. T his argum ent is sim ilarly rejected with the sam e cautionary note as with the prior argum ent. 24 The Pan el found this argu ment so who lly devoid of merit that it cou ld likely su bject Mr. Gatlin to san ctions if repeated at th e CAS lev el. Page 17 of 53 6.10 Returning to the ap propriate s tandards, Mr. Gatlin nex t argues th at the WADA Code does not provide any m echanism to take into consid eration the severity of a prior violation when determ ining the appropriate sanction for a subsequent violation. For this reason, he argues that the Panel should strike those por tions of the W ADA Code that vi olate public policy. The Panel does not consider it within its purview to stri ke the W ADA Code or any portion of the W ADA Code, but does consider it within its power to take into a ccou nt all re levant circum stances in determ ining application of that Code and the sanctions, if any, im posed thereunder. 6.11 He argues that given the 2001 AAA Panel's decision on the first violation, there can be no seriou s conten tion that M r. Gatlin shou ld be treated the same as a person who intended to cheat on bo th occasions25. To subject Mr. Gatlin to an ei ght (8) year or life-tim e ban would violate proportionality and funda mental fairness. The Panel notes that, w hile the IAAF Code would im pose a lifetim e ban on Mr. Gatlin, it appears that U SADA is cognizant of the circum stances of the first vi olation and has sought only a \"maxim um\" of eight (8) years suspension rather than a lifetim e ban. The Panel considers this recogniti on to be significant. 6.12 Because there was no provision for a fi nding of \"no fault\" in 2001, and hence the 2001 AAA Panel m ade no such finding, Mr. Gatlin argues that this Panel m ust now determ ine the appropriate category of fault for the f irst violation - ef fectively apply ing the current IAAF code re troac tively to th e facts of the f irst cas e. U SADA has vigorously opposed this request on the reasonable ground that prior decisions shoul d not be exam ined beyond their results, and certainly not be \"retried\" in essence. 6.13 This issue has given this Panel a great de al of pause, and lead to the reopening and supplem ental briefing in this case. The Pane l believes that, in dete rmining the appropriate 25 The Pan el does not disagree, bu t notes that the IAAF Ru les would requ ire a lifeim e ban for an athlete that was found to have \"i ntended\" to cheat on two occassi ons. Page 18 of 53 sanctions in this case, it should consider the fa cts and circum stances of the prior case and the underlying purposes for enhancing a punishm ent for a subsequent viol ation. It appears that the this necessity has been recognized by am endments to the WADA Code to now perm it findings of \"no fault\" or \"no significant fa ult\" and that such findings ar e important in considering the imposition of sanctions for subsequent violations of the IAAF Rules, Indeed, it appears that USADA agrees, in that it has onl y sought a reduced penalty in this case, based on \"the facts and circum stances surrounding Mr. Gatlin's positive test as reflected in USADA v. Gatlin (AAA 30 190 00546 01)...\" 6.14 Turnin g to 200 1 doping vio lation by Mr . Gatlin, there appears to be no question that he had a legal right to take the prescription m edication that caused his first violation, he was appropriately taking that prescrip tion m edicine to treat a prop erly diagnosed disability, and taking the medication outside of competition was not a violation of the IAAF Code in 2001, nor is it a violation now. 6.15 Based on the foregoing, Mr. Gatlin argued l oosely that it would be a violation of United Sta tes law, specif ically the A mericans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act (\"ADA\"), to base any enhancem ent of Mr. Gatlin's period of ineligibility on the use of such medication. He argues that USADA and the IAAF are required to m ake a \"reasonable accomm odation\" for Mr. Gatlin. In th is case, h e argues, a re asonable ac commodation would be to lim it the effective tim e and scope of the firs t violation in consider ing the second violation.26 The Panel first notes that Mr. Ga tlin did not present reasoned ar guments with respe ct to this claim , nor explicate the law as it m ight apply, nor apply the present facts to that law. Mr. Gatlin, 26 The Panel s uggests that t he langua ge requiring a \"reas onable accom odati on\" refers to the eve nt in question. In this case, the 20 01 prescri ption medication for a diagnosed condition. Had Mr. Gatlin raised it in that matter, an d USADA argu ed that it would take the failure to provide for a \"reas onable a ccom odation\" in 2001, i n the event t hat Mr. Gatlin was in volved a seco nd time in a do ping case, Mr. Gatlin would understand ably and reason ably objected. There is no claim in this matter that the use of exogenous testosterone was under physician's care or was required by any chron ic con dition of Mr. Ga tlin. Page 19 of 53 through his atto rney, Jo hn P. Collin s, in his M emorandum Regarding the Issue of \"Fault\" in the 2001 Arbitration, did present an argu ment relating to the applicability of the ADA t o the first case, which noted that th e \"reasonable accomm odati on,\" in th e first case should have been that \"USADA provide\" Mr. Gatlin \" individualized n otice on ho w far in advance of a co mpetition h e should stop taking his prescription m edicine.\" T he Panel agrees that the issue of a reasonable accomm odation to perm it the taking of a prescrip tion drug sh ould apply to the ins tance for which it is involved, nam ely here the 2001 violation. Apparently it was not argued then. In any event, the Panel finds neither that que stion, nor the question whether US ADA should take on the duties of a personal physician and advisor is before it in this case. As king this Panel to go back and consider tha t issue f or the first case, tr uly would b e a \"retrial\" of that case. 6.16 Mr. Gatlin then goes to the h eart of his argument. He argues his firs t violation w as vacated by the IAAF. Therefore, as a resu lt of that action b y the IAAF, there can be no first violation upon which to enhance th e penalty in this case. E ither the decision of a first doping violation was vacated an d hence of no eff ect, or the IAAF, in finding \"exceptional circum stances,\" im plicitly m ade a fi nding of no fau lt or negligence for the first violation. It is this issue w hich has occupied this P anel and lead to the reopening of th e record and supplem ental briefing herein. 6.17 First, the Panel m ust note that the 2001 AAA Pa nel's decision was not overturned or vacated by the IAAF. That is not within th e purview of the IAAF, but within th at of the Court of Arbitration for Sport (\"CAS\"). Rather, the IA AF was able to act und er its cod e to reinstate an athlete despite a finding of a doping violation, and that appears to be what was done in 2002. Second, the Panel m ust note that no appeal to CAS was taken from the 2001 first finding of a doping violation. Finally, the Pa nel notes that the 2001 AAA Pane l decision, while \"retain[ing] Page 20 of 53 full jurisdiction . . . so that it m ay reconsider the two-year suspension\" which was im posed by that Panel, the 2001 AAA Panel did find a dopi ng violation and did im pose a period of ineligibility. Circum stances intervened so that, although retaining \"full jurisdiction,\" the 2001 AAA Panel was never called upon by Mr. Gatlin to reconsider the case, nor did it take it upon itself to reconsider or otherwise finali ze its decision and awar d once the IAAF found \"exceptional circum stances\" and reinstated Mr. Gatlin. That AAA never surrendered jurid iction e ither. 6.18 Mr. Gatlin argues that ble principles shou ld estop US ADA fro m relying on his first violation, since, as was found in the 2001 decision, USADA was at the tim e advising athletes generally sim ply to stop taking any problem atic m edications and that would be sufficient. There is no argum ent made tha t Mr. Gatlin was s pecifically advised on th is point b y USADA in 2001, nor that USADA a dvised athletes not to seek to docum ent his therapeutic use and seek a T herapeu tic Use Exem ption (a \"TUE \"). Nevertheless, Mr. Gatlin argues, he followed this general advice and his cl early inadvertent and unknowing vi olation in 2001 should not be counted by USADA. The Panel fin ds som e merit to this po sition and will discus s it further, below. 6.19 Mr. Gatlin further argued that only 2% of the world was testing junior athletes at their events in 2001 and, therefore, f or the sa ke of har monization, the Panel should lim it the applic ability of the f irst test. The Panel finds no m erit to this argum ent, as there is no question that testing was being conducted, that it was properly conducted and accurate results were obtained in 2001. Seeking shelter be hind an argum ent that others were not tested, so \"why m e,\" is so m eritless as to be f rivolous. Page 21 of 53 6.20 He argues that the WADA Code is a contra ct of adhesion. Therefore, any am biguity in the Code must be interpre ted in favor of Mr. Gatlin. 6.22 He argues the date of the commencem ent of the sanction im posed by this Panel should start from April 22, 2006, the date the sample was tested. 7. USADA's Arguments 7.1 USADA argues that, for Mr. Ga tlin to obtain relief in th e form of a reduction in the period of his suspension for his s econd violation, he m ust rebut th e incontrovertible proof of the existence of a synthe tic testosterone in his system with \"stron g and com pelling \" evide nce tha t he was not at fault. USADA argues in order to meet this standard, Respondent m ust prove: (i) How the synthetic testos terone entered his system ; (ii)That he was not at fault for entry of synthetic testoste rone into his system ; and (iii)That his negligence did not contribute to the entry of synthetic testosterone into his system . 7.2 USADA argues that Mr. Gatlin has not proved how the synth etic tes tosterone entered his system therefore he cann ot exclud e the possibility of intentional use. 7.3 USADA argues that Mr. Gatlin did not pr esent sufficient eviden ce to prove that his physical therapist, or anyone else, sabotaged him . 7.4 USADA argues it gave Mr. Gatlin the benefit of the unfortunate circum stances of his first doping violation in 2001, by self-im posing a reduction from a life- time ban to eight (8) years because of the nature of his first v iolation. If the Panel furth er redu ced h is period of ineligibility, USADA argues, it wou ld be the eq of obtain ing a d ouble recog nition of the circum stances of the first violation. Page 22 of 53 7.5 The WADA Code principle that an athlete is responsible for conduct of his entourage in providing h im prohibited substances is essen tial, USADA argues, because otherwise a huge loophole will exist for athletes to seek to avoi d penalties for drug use sim ply by having their coach, trainer or other su pport person nel tak e resp onsibility fo r causing the positiv e test. 7.6 USADA argues that Mr. Gatlin has not prov ided sufficiently substantial assistance to USADA to justify a reduction of any sancti on. Specifically, USADA argues that while Mr. Gatlin m ay have provid ed substan tial ass istance to the U.S. Governm ent, his ass istance has not lead to the discovering or establis hing of a listed anti-doping rule violation. This is required in order for this Panel to consider whethe r a reduction is appropriate under 10.5.3. 7.7 USADA argues that Mr. Gatlin 's first violation should, if anything, be considered to involve a fin ding of \"no significan t fault o r negligence\" and as such his p eriod of ineligibility should be reduced to eight (8) years under th e IAAF Code, and for that reason, USADA has sought only eight (8) years. W hile USADA argues that Mr. Gatlin shou ld be preclud ed from seeking a lower sanction based on this fact in light of USAD A's unilateral reduction evidenced by the stipulation, that very stipul ation explicitly states that \"Mr. Gatlin reserves the right to contest the eight-year sanction recommended by USADA,\" (parag from recommending or Mr. Gatlin fro m seeking a lesser penalty or no penalty...\" (paragraph v). (E mphasis added). While USADA has not recomm ended a less er penalty at th is point, it clearly left open the potential. 7.8 USADA argues that this Panel has no author ity to exercise any di scretion to vary the penalties found in the C ode where no \"lacuna\" in the provisions of the WADA Code is found. Mr. Gatlin's violations were for two serious dop ing offenses that did not involve \"specified substances,\" such as in the first offense in the Puerta case, and \"no significa nt fault\" in both the Page 23 of 53 first and the second offens e. USADA argues that Puerta found a lacuna and that the Puerta Panel decision was proper becau se 10.5.2 provid es for a redu ction when \" one\"of the offenses (emphasis in original) involved no significant fault or neg ligence, and that 10.5.2 did not cover the situation where \" both\" (emphasis original) involved \"no significant fau lt\" on the part of the athlete. Ind eed, rather than bei ng based essentially on the nature of the f irst offenes, the essentia l thrust of the Puerta case is found pa ragraph 11.7.22, where the panel concluded: [T]he fact is that the second offence doe s not, in the Panel's view, require the imposition of a sanction that would have the effect of bringing Mr. Puerta's career to an end. That is no t an issue in th e presen t case where ther e is neither a finding of nosignificant fault, nor a technical or m inor violati on of the WADA Code. However, since the Panel finds its delibe ration s to be f ocused sole ly on the f irst offense, this is not relevant. What the Panel here finds relevant is the holding in Puerta that it does not have \"general discretion\" to impose such an award as the m embers might deem appropriate in the abs ence of clear gui delines, or if called on to act as a body reviewing a petition to determine if there are such \"exceptional circum stances\" as to justify a reduction in the period of suspension, notwithstanding the existence of a violation and the appropri ate award under the rule s (paragraph 11.7.25) and cautioning subsequent panels against being \"tempt ed to find a gap or lacuna in the WADC. (at 11.7.27). 7.9 USADA argues Mr. Gatlin fails to prove that the W ADA Code repres ents a con tract of adhesion. 7.10 USADA argues the fact that Mr. Gatlin 's first offense took place in a \"junio r\" competition is also com pletely irre levant. Furth er as Mr. Gatlin was 19 at the tim e, he was not a Page 24 of 53 minor. Attributing special stat us to a junior offense would unde rmine the consistent application of the rules as other athletes ha ve had juvenile offenses consid ered prior offenses without any mitigation in penalty. 7.11 USADA argues if this Panel were to de termine that \"excepti onal circum stances\" m ay exist in relation to the first o ffense then it is this Panel's du ty pursuant to IAAF ADR 38.16 to refer the m atter to the IAAF Doping Review Board for consideration of th e circum stances of the first offense, as was done in the case of the 2001 doping violation. Under no circum stances, USADA insists, is it app ropria te under the applicable IAAF Anti- Doping Rules f or this Panel to evaluate the fault level of the first violation. 7.12 USADA argues that any effort by this Pa nel to explain, supplem ent or go behind the written decision of the 2001 AAA Panel would c onstitute an im proper co llateral attack on the determ ination of the first panel. This is im proper, USADA argues, because the introduction of new evidence to supplement a prior arbitration deci sion or to retry an issu es that was, or could have been, d ecided in a p rior arbitration pr oceed ing will unnecessarily complicate an d multiply proceed ings. Attem pting to supplem ent the record of a prior proceeding o r to \"investig ate\" th e basis for a p rior proceed ing is inh erently unrelia ble as m emories fade, docum ents are lost, liv e witness testimony that was not transcribed cannot be reliably reproduced and the circum stances of the first case can never be precisely recreated. The parties to the p rior decisions have a right to expect that the prior decision is final and should not have to be concerne d that it is s ubject to change or retrying in a second pr oceeding. The prospect of going outside the written decision of the firs t pan el pres ents the additional com plication that a m ember of this Panel hearing the second arbitration, was also a m ember of the 2001 AAA Panel. Consequently, the danger exists Page 25 of 53 that a single arbitrator's view of the decision of the first panel could be given undue weight because he was a witnes s to the p rior proceed ings. 7.13 USADA argues that in 2001 the sanction for the use of an am pheta mine in competition was a \"m inimum \" two year pe riod of ineligibility . This was clearly a ser ious offense. Thus som e degree of fault must be assigned becaus e Mr. Gatlin failed to ab ide by the IAAF rules in place in 2 001 regard ing medical ex emptions. 7.14 USADA argues it is apparent that Mr. Ga tlin was at least negligent and perhaps even significantly negligent for failing to follo w the 2001 defined m edical exem ption process. 8. Legal Analysis and Decision (a) Gatlin failed to sustain his burden of proof regarding the second offense. 8.1 Mr. Gatlin accep ts his positive test on April 2 2, 2006 as a second vio lation. However, he petitions this Panel to reduce th e two-year sanction specified by the WADA Code to one of the following: (1) no sanction under 10. 5.1 because he bears No Fault or Neg ligence for this positive test; (2) a reduced sanction (one year) und er 10.5.2 becau se he bears No Significant Fault or Negligence for this positiv e test; and/or (2) a re duced sanction under 10.5.3 because he h as provided Substantial Assistance in Discovering or estab lishing an Anti-Doping Rule Violation by Athlete S upport Personnel and Others. 8.2 Mr. Gatlin m ust prove the following to obtain relief under 10.5.1 or 10.5.2: (1) under 10.5.1 that he bears No Fault or Negligen ce or under 10.5.2 that he bears No Significant Fault or Negligence for the violation and (2) how the Prohibited Substance entered his body. The definition of No Fault or Negligence estab lishe s the standa rd of care Mr. Gatlin m ust meet to satisfy the first part of this two-part test under 10.5.1. It states the following: Page 26 of 53 The Athlete's establishing that he or she did not know or suspect, and could not reasonably have known or suspected even with the exercise of utmost caution, that he or she had Used or been adm inistered the Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method.27 8.3 The definition of No Significant Fault or Neg ligence under 10.5.2 is as follows: The Athlete's estab lishing that h is or her fault o r negligen ce, when viewed in the totality of the circumstances and taking into ac count the c riteria for No Fault or Negligence, was not sign ificant in re lationship to the anti-doping rule violation.28 8.5 Mr. Gatlin testified that he believes hi s physical therapist sabotaged him by rubbing cream on his legs that contained testosterone29. He stated this happe ned the night before his April 22, 2006 doping control test at the Kansas Relays and the day of his test, right before he provided a urine sam ple to drug control.30 He testified that havi ng the physical therapist rub cream on his legs right before drug control was a change in protocol.31 He testif ied tha t the cream the physical therapist rubbed on him felt di fferent than at other tim es. It had a tingly feeling.32 However, Mr. Gatlin adm itted that he never ask ed why the cream used in 2006 felt different, which alone m ight be sufficient to de monstrate th at he did not exercise \"utmost caution \",33 and the testim ony of the trainer Mr. Whetst ine was that the product cam e in a lipid (or oily) base as well as a lighter based used prev iously, and that was the difference. He denied that the product was otherwise diffe rent from that previously used or that he otherwise switched products on Mr. Gatlin. While the P anel m ight not expect Mr. W hetstine to adm it to such 27 WAD A Code, Appendix 1, page 76. 28 Id. 29 The Panel has considered this arg ument and the evidence presented in supp ort, even thoug h it m ay be an open issue as t o whether Mr. Whetstin e was a member of Mr. Gatlin 's \"en tourage.\" Th e evidence ind icated that, while Mr. Wh etstin e worked with other athletes as well, he regularly attend ed to Mr. Gatlin and had virtually unrestricted ac cess to him. 30 Transcript of Proceedi ngs, USADA v. Ju stin Gatlin, AAA No. 30 190 00170 07, Atlanta, Georgia (\"Transcr ipt\") (July 30 - Augu st 1, 2007) pp.89 :3-91:5;93:18-21. 31 Id. at 99:16-100:13. 32 Id. at p. 93:18-21. 33 In add ition, it ap pears that Vo lteran cream is a pr escription item, and Mr. Gatlin had no prescrip tion, the product being obtained by the trainer in Europe or elsewhere. Page 27 of 53 underhanded activ ity (if it occu rred), the fact is that there is no substantiation of Mr. Gatlin 's naked claim . 8.6 He submitted evidence that the physical therapist had a motive for sabotaging him . The physical therapis t had reques ted a $5,000 bonus from Mr. Gatlin, which his agen t, Renaldo Nehe miah had rejected. Evidence w as introduced to show that the physical therapist m ay have had an unrealistic view of his significance to Mr. Gatlin. In noting Mr. G atlin's accom plishm ents, the physical therapist used the te rm \"we,\" includ ing him self as an individual who won the world championships. The physical therapist testified as follows: Yes. W hen we were in Yokoha ma in 2006, I had a professional m eeting with Renaldo wherein I discussed the possibility of a consideration - I offered up for consideration the idea of having his client consider bonusing m e. I m ean, we had experienced a great deal of success, as well published in the papers and seen on television, and, you know, we had the wo rld - I m ean, we were, the world cham pionships, gold m edals in the O lympics. I m ean, I just offered up the idea. I put it in his hands. 34 8.7 The physical therapist also knew that af ter his bonus request, Mr. Gatlin's group w as trying to te rminate him .35 This was th e exten t of Mr. Gatlin's circum stantial ev idence of sabotage. T here was no evidence that any of the cream s used by the phys ical therapist actually tested positive. 8.8 There was som e hearsay testim ony regardin g the physical therapist using a different tube of cream from his pocket with Mr. Gatlin th an with oth er athletes at the Kansas event. However, Mr. Gatlin did not observe this di rectly and did not present the witnesses w ho allegedly observed this conduct. There was so me testim ony regarding a tube of cream in the physical therapist's hotel room that showed the sym bol of a pr oduct that m ight have contained testos terone. Again, Mr. Gatlin d id not observe this dir ectly and the witn esses who allegedly 34 Id. at 572:13-25. 35 Id. at p. 532:13-535:8. Page 28 of 53 observed this did not testify. The testim ony in this regard was not credible, was not substantiated, and what efforts were m ade to subs tantiate the claim were not originally presented by Mr. Gatlin, and when requested to do so, actuall y refuted any claim of a tainted ointm ent or cream . 8.9 More importantly, the evid ence subm itted by Mr. Gatlin did not eliminate the possibility of intentional use or the possibili ty that he was th e unwitt ing victim of doping by members of his coach ing staff. Mr. Gatlin testif ied that h e had been given an inje ction , supposedly of vitam in B12, by his assistant coach, Randall E vans, be fore the Kansas Relays at which he tes tified pos itive. Mr. Gatlin testifie d that this was v ery unusual to be given an injection by the coaching staff, but believed that it was approved by his doctor, Dr. Martini. Yet, he did not produce either Randall Evans or Dr. Mart ini as a witness to ve rify this inf ormation.36 Mr. Gatlin testif ied that in April, p rior to th e Kansas Relays, his ham string was not fully healed and that was the reason for the sho t.37 However, if that injec tion actually contained testosterone, that could have caused the positive test. Also, Mr . Gatlin testif ied to b eing given a Voltaren pill (anti-inflam matory) by coach Evans. That pill could have like wise contained testosterone. In either cas e, as it was ad ministered b y his coach, it would not qualify as an instance of \"no fault\" or \"no significant fault.\" During his testim ony concerning the alleged B- 12 shot, and on cross exam ination, Mr. Gatlin exhibited som e uncertain ty as to dates and sequences, and subsequent docum entation supported a conclusion that m ore than just the one shot w as adm inistered to Mr. 36 Id. at 223:2-234:15. 37 Mr. Gatlin 's leg problems in March to April of 2006 were corrobo rated by his massage therapist, Ms. Blanke nship. Page 29 of 53 Gatlin du ring the of 2006.38. Sim ictory testim ony a bout the nature and co lor of the supp osed Volteran pill. 8.10 Sim ply stated, this Panel does not know with any degree of confidence how the testos terone enter ed Mr. Gatlin 's system ; transder mally or by pill o r injection.39 Mr. G atlin's expert, Dr. Black, testified that certain food supplem ents given to him for analysis did not contain any prohibited s ubstances. B ased on th is absence of evidence, M r. Gatlin a rgued that h e eliminated anything that he self-a dministered which could have resulted in the positive test. The Panel finds this kind of argum entation for an inference from the absence of evidence not probative of anything and singularly unhelpful. That would not es tablish that Dr. Black had the right supp lements to test in the first p lace, no r that the testo sterone was not adm inistered by shot, pill o r othe rwise. Dr. Black adm itted that he could not say how the tes tosterone entered Mr. Gatlin 's system . Most signif icantly, Mr. Gatlin te stified that Dr Black did not tes t any cream s, including Volteran cream, whether obtained from Mr. Gatlin's trainer or otherwise. Since Mr. Gatlin 's theory of sabotage relie d upon application of a topical cream , that m ight have proved more helpf ul. In this regard, USADA m akes a strong argum ent. If Mr. Gatlin cannot prove how the testosterone entered his system , and he did not, he cannot prove two significant facts. F irst, that it was the physical therap ist that placed the testosterone in his system transderm ally; and second, that he d id not intention ally take te stosterone. Fu rtherm ore, d espite the initia l representations that cream s were not tested by Dr. Black, that tu rned out not to be the case. Dr. Black was provided with a num ber of cream or ointm ent products obtained fr om Mr. Gatlin 's trainer, who 38 Ms. Blank enship also testified th at, while sh e did not see any in jection sites wh ile wo rking on Mr. Gatlin , the evi dence s howed that he could have had as m any as 3 shots in the Spring of 2006, and she did not see th ose either. Hence, the Pan el finds Ms. Blank enships' testim ony to be not probative and unhelp ful. 39 Id. at p.749:21-750:3. Page 30 of 53 had allegedly applied the suspected cream upon which the sabotage theory is based. Mr.W hetstin e testified th at he prov ided Mr. Gatlin's inves tigators with sa mples of these therapeutic cream s in 2006 upon request. 8.11 Finally , while Mr. Gatlin s eems like a co mplete g entlem en, and was genuinely and deeply upset during his testim ony, the Panel can not elim inate the possib ility that Mr. Gatlin intentionally took testosterone, or accepted it from a coach, ev en though he testified to the contrary. T hus, by failing to prove how the te stosterone entered his system , as required by 10.5.1 and 105.2, Mr. Gatlin has failed to sustain his burden of proof to show that he had either No Fault or Negligence or No Significant Faul t or Negligence, and the P anel so finds. (b) The WADA Code is Law ful and Enforceable 8.12 Mr. Gatlin argues that the W ADA Code is a contract that is in violation of U.S. and Swiss law and public policy Consequently, Mr . Gatlin states \"... the proper rem edy here is for this Hear ing Panel to strik e those portions of the contract th at are illeg al and vio late public policy; namely, to strike the enhance penalty for a second violation. (Gatli n Prehearing Brief at 12). The Panel finds the argum ent unpersuasive and unsupported. (i) Even if a Contract of Adhesion, the WADA Code Applies 8.13 Mr. Gatlin argues that the WADA Code constitutes a \"contract of adhesion\" and quotes from Black's Law Dictionary for a defini tion. His solitary argum ent, however, is that any ambiguity should, t herefore, be construed against WADA and i n favor of t he indivi dual. Mr. Gatlin's j udicious limitation on his attack based on this t heory is well cons idered. Even if a contract of adhesion, that does not m ake the arbitration agreement bindi ng Mr. Gatlin to perform ance under the WADA Code unenforceable. Page 31 of 53 8.14 U.S law strongly favors the arbitratio n of disputes and the enf orcem ent of agreem ents to arbitrate. First Options of Chicago, Inc, v. Kaplan , 514 U.S. 938, 945 (1995); Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp. , 460 U.S. 1, 24-5 (1983); In re Prudential Ins. Co. of America Sal es Practice Litig.

Congress specifically enacted the Federal Arb itration Act ( \"FAA\") to \"revers[e] centuries of by \"plac[ing] arbitra tion agreem ents upon the sam e footing as other contracts.\" Pritzker v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, F enner & Smith, Inc ., 7 F.3d 1110, 1113 (3d Cir. 1993) ( quoting Shearson/American E Inc. v. McMahon , 482 U.S. 220, 225-26 (1987)); Harris v. Gr een Tree Fin ancial Corp. , 183 F.3d 173, 178 (3d Cir. 1999) (citing Shearson/A merican Express and Pritzker ).

Page 32 of 53 The m ere fact that there is a lack of equivalen ce between the perform ances of the parties does not even get close to the establishm ent of unconscionabilit y. A harsh result alone is an insufficient ground for a finding of unconscionability. Superior bargaining power is not in its elf a ground for striking down a resultant contract as unconscionable. 7-29 C ORB IN ON CONTRACTS \u00a7 29.4. 8.16 Moreover, a finding of unconscionability requ ires a two-f old and present. Harris , 183 F.3d at 181; Bullic k v. 2004 Dist. LEXIS 21128, *20-21 (E.D. Pa. 2004). Procedural unconscionability pertains to the p rocess by wh ich an agreem ent is reach ed and substantive unconscionability refers to the contents of the ag reem ent. Harris , 183 F.3d at 182. At m ost, Mr. Gatlin has challenged the procedural aspects of the contract by which he is bound to the WADA Code. 8.17 There are clearly legitim ate sports \"realities\" that have lead to the adoption of a comprehensive anti-doping code, and those realities include the fact that adherence cannot be voluntary, nor different from athlete to athlete. 8.18 However, Mr. Gatlin's p osition that th e contract was not neg otiated by him, and therefore any term s, if ambiguous, ought to be construed in a light most favorable to him , is a long established m axim of contract interpretation. (ii) Neither U.S. nor Sw iss law invalidates the WA DA Code 8.19 Even accepting Mr. Gatlin's argum ents that Swiss law would, under som e circum stances, invalidate the pr ovisions of the WADA Code that relate to second offenses, namely the failu re to hav e a \"sunset\" provision that would eventual ly negate a prior offense as a relevant consideration, and even accepting his argum ents that WADA has recognized this and proposed ch anges to avo id that issu e, at m ost Mr . Gatlin has established th at a tim e limit of less Page 33 of 53 than eight (8) years would be presumptively reas onable. In light of the fact that the 2001 positiv e test was only 5 years prio r to the 2006 pos itive test (and the award only 4 years prior to the 2006 event), the Panel concludes it need not cons ider this argum ent furthe r. The references by Mr. Gatlin to the United States Sentencing Guid elines for crim inal offenses is sing ularly irrelevant and would, in any event, m erely es tablish that even for incarceration, a sentence imposed as long ago as 10 or 15 years woul d be pertinent for determ ining recidivism . (iii) Mr. Gatlin has not presented ev idence that the W ADA Code violates public polic y 8..20 Mr. Gatlin's argum ent appears in a single paragraph and m akes no attem pt to explain how the Am ericans with Disabilities Act or the Rehabilitation Act would apply, or how the facts of this case should be viewed in light of those statutes. The argu ment is esse ntially th at USADA m ust make a \"reasonable accommodation\" fo r individuals with di sabilities, a nd then goes on to suggest that the appr opriate \"accommodation\" is that the enhancem ent provisions of the WADA Code for a second violation not be a pplied to Mr. Gatlin - ag ain by reason of the limitation in time of the applic ability of the f irst offense. W hile the Pan el finds tha t the issu es have not been presented adequately to preserve any claim by Mr. Gatlin on this subject, we observe th at what constitutes a reaso nable accommodation would likely vary cas e by case, and since the claim is m ade only as to the first offense and not the second, the tim e to have done so was in 2001. (c) Consideration of a reduction under 10.5.3 8.21 This Panel next considers whether to reduce Mr. Gatlin's period of ineligibility under WADA Code 10.5.3. The language under 10.5.3 is perm issive. It states in part, the Anti- Doping Organization \"m ay also reduce the period of Ineligibility in an individua l case where th e Page 34 of 53 Athlete has provided substantial assistance to th e Anti-Doping Orga nization which r esults in th discoveri ng or establishing an anti- doping rule violation by another Person . . .\" 8.22 The term \" may\" provides this P anel with the discretion whethe r to reduce the period of ineligibility if the athlete sa tisfies the requirem ents of 10.5.3. The Panel finds that Mr. Gatlin has provided substantial assistance to the United States Governm ent in investigating doping in sport. He immediately cooperated with the IR S without hesitation. He m ade undercover calls.40 He wore a wire, putting him self at risk. W hile USADA contended that Mr. Gatlin did not \"cooperate\" with it in any inve stigations and ought not be gi ven credit under 10.5.1, USADA did concede (See, USADA Prehearing Brie f, at 14) that that it reserved judgm ent as to whether the assistance to the U.S. governm ent would be su fficient to justify a reduction. Moreover, the record reflects that USADA never sought to avail its elf of Mr. Gatlin's assist ance, and that is not within Mr. Gatlin's control. USADA did enjoy the fruits of the investig ation and assisted the IRS with advice. The record reflects extende d assistan ce to the Unite d States Governm ent, which goes far beyond the contem plated assistan ce to anti-doping sports authorities. 8.23 In considering, however, whether such cooperation was suffi cient under the WADA Code to justify a reduction, the Panel m ust first analyze the la nguage of Section 10.5.3, indicating that discretion should be based on the cooperation resul ting in \". . . the Anti-Doping rule viol ation by another Person....\" At this stage of the proceedings, th ere is no evidence that it has b een established that any other person or organization definitely has been discov ered involved in doping vi olations. However, the Panel is faced with the fact that the U. S. governm ent agency involved was willin g only to give lim ited inform ation of a conclusory nature rath er than spe cifics, and that the inves tigation is 40 Id. at 162:23-164:25. Page 35 of 53 apparently still on going. Hence, there m ay or may not be inf ormation which has is the \"discovery\" of the identify of pe rsons involved in doping in sport, and the investigation, in which Mr. Gatlin clearly assisted, m ay yet result in su ch a \"discovery.\" Hence, the Panel finds that under the particular circum stances of this case, and the general princi ples of equity, it retains the discretion to consider a reduction in the award in this m atter. 8.24 The Panel m ust consider, howev er, th at Mr. Gatlin has tested positiv e for testosterone, a very serious viol ation and weigh that against the assistance given the anti-doping authorities. (d) No Reduction under 10.8 8.25. Mr. Gatlin also requests that we start his sanction from th e date of the positive test on April 22, 20 06 because he was not told about h is April 22, 2 006 test un til June 15, 20 06. The parties have subm itted no evidence that would allo w this Pan el to con clude that the d elay was intentional or negligent on the part of USA DA, but there was an unus ually long period of tim e between test and notification. As th is was Mr. Gatlin 's burd en to prove, he has failed to sustain his burden of proof and the Panel declines to st art his sanc tion from the date the u rine specim en was collected. However, the Panel declines to adopt the start date proposed by USADA of August 15, 2006. DECISION AWARD Page 36 of 53 Mr. Gat lin's liability fo r the doping violat ion. 9.1 Since there is no question that ther e has been a 2006 doping violation, the m ajor issue before the Panel is whether the ei ght (8) year suspension sought by USADA41 because of Mr. Gatlin's first violation in 2001. The W ADA Code provides that w ith respect to a doping violation, the Athlete shall have the opportunity to establish the ba sis for elim inating or reducing the sanction as provi ded in Article 10.5.1.42 In pertinent part, it states: If the Athle te estab lishes in an ind case involving an anti-doping rule violation . . . that he or she bears No Fault or Negligence for the violation, the otherwise applicable pe riod of Ineligibility sha ll be eliminated. . . . . The athlete must also establish how the Prohibited S ubstance entered his or her system in order to h ave the pe riod of Ineligib ility elim inated. In the ev ent th is Article is applied and the period of Ineligibility othe rwise a pplicab le is elim inated, the anti- doping rule violation shall no t be considered a violati on for the lim ited purpose of determ ining the period of Ineligility f or multiple violations u nder Article 10.2, 10.3 and 10.6. 9.2 The Panel finds that this provision m eans what it says. If an athl ete is has \"no fault\" for a violation, then that particular violation \"shall not be considered a viol ation\" for purposes of enhancing a penalty for a subseque nt violation. T his concept co mports with the principle of funda mental fairness. 9.3 The real dilemm a for this Panel in evalua ting Mr. Gatlin's first violation is that given the procedural history of the case, the 2001 AAA Panel did not m ake a fin ding of whether Mr. Gatlin was at fault for his first violation. At the tim e of the 2001 AAA Panel decision, the WADA Code had not been adopted and there was no such provision for a \"no fault\" reduction - and hence no reason for the 2001 AAA Panel to have done so. W ere that 2001 case heard today, under CAS legal precedent and the WADA Code, it is clear that any Pan el hearing th at case would have to consider the nature of the fau lt involved if presented by a respondent. That, 41 In lig ht of the stip ulation of USADA, a lifeti me ban for a second offense is not at issue . 42 WADA Code Article 10.3. Page 37 of 53 however, is not the s et of circum stances facing th e Panel. This Panel, as detailed above, has been asked to consider w hether a \"no fault\" findi ng would have or should have been m ade in the 2001 AAA Panel decision, and whether this Panel m ay do so now. 9.4 In Puerta v. International Tennis Federation CAS 2006/ A/1025, the CAS panel found that the underlying Internat ional Tennis Federation (\"IT F\") panel failed to take into consideratio n the circumstances of th e first o ffense in im posing an eight year sanction on the Athlete for his second doping offense. 43 The CAS panel in Puerta found that the im position of an eight-year period of in eligibility would ef fectively pu t an e nd to the A thlete's career. Given this drastic sanction, the CAS panel consid ered the circum stances of the first case.44 Given its review of the first violation, the CAS panel gave Mr. Puerta a two (2) year sanction rather than the eight (8) year sanction im posed by the ITF. We concur with the Puerta reasoning and gave consideration to the circum stances of the first violation, which in cludes evaluating Mr. Gatlin's level of fault. 9.5 USADA has argued that the Puerta panel action was proper under the circum stances becaus e there was a g ap or lacuna in the W ADA Code and that the facts before it involved a \"unique factual circum stance that 'm ay never arise again' ... that was not covered by the express language of the Code.\" (USADA Pr ehearing brief at 16). The Panel respectfully observes that the likelihood of an athlete having two offense, both of which involve a f inding of \"no significant fault,\" is far highe r than the case presently before this Pan el, where th e athlete in question has received the assistance and coope ration of an anti-dopi ng agency (USADA) in securing an immediate reinstatem ent fro m the governing body (IAAF), because the AAA Panel found that th e athlete d id not cheat, d id not in tend to cheat and had observed standard, accepted 43 Puert a, supra, at \u00b61 1..7.22.; \u00b611.7.14. Page 38 of 53 and recommend procedures to m anage prescribed, therap eutic m edications. While in th e presen t case the respondent did not carry his burden of showing no significant fault in the second violation, w e find that is not the question that face s the Panel. In Puerta , there was in the first inst ance, a self-m edication befo re an event, without an historical diagnosis or prescribed m edication fo r a chronic problem . Als o, in Puerta, while the suspension was reduced by the Pane l in th e first of fense f or no signif icant fault, it was still a finding of a first offense with the im position of a penalty and, therefore, it should have been considered as a first offense .. This P anel also disagrees with USADA's distinction of the Puerta lacuna from the facts of this case. 10.5.2, which governed the Puerta case, provides: This Article 10.5.2 applies only to anti-dop ing rule violations involving A rticle 2.1 (Presence of Prohibited Substance or its Metabolites or Markers), Use of Prohibited S ubstance o r Prohibited Method under Article 2. 2, failing to subm it to Sample collection under Article 2.3, or ad ministration of a Prohibited Substance or Prohibited Method under Arti cle 2.8. If an Athlete es tablishes in an individual case involving such violations that he or she bears No Significant Fault or Negligence, then the p eriod of Ineligib ility m ay be reduced, but the reduced period of Ineligibility m ay not be less than one-half of the m inimum period of Ineligibility otherwise ap plicab le. If the otherwise applicable period of Ineligibility is a lifetim e, the reduced period under this section m ay be no less than 8 years. W hen a Prohibited Substa nce o r its Markers or Metabo lites is detected in an Athlete's Specim en in violation of Article 2.1 (Presence of Prohibited S ubstance), the Athlete must also establish how the Prohibited Substance entered his or her system in or der to h ave the pe riod of Ineligib ility reduced. Code provision 10.5.2 does not provide, as US ADA argues, that the section applies only to one ra ther than two in stances of a finding of \"no significant fa ult.\" It applies in any given specific \"... individual case...,\" a nd that in the case of a second offense, it ought not be reduced to less than 8 years. Th at sec tion m akes no m ention of the first offense, which m ay be the lacuna mentioned by the Puerta Panel. In contrast, 10.5.1, which is the basis of the argum ents presented by Mr. Gatlin that the first offense ought be cons idered a \"no f ault\" event, specifica lly Page 39 of 53 contem plates analysis of the first offense in de termining the penalty for the second offense, and provides: If the Athle te estab lishes in an ind ividual case involving an anti-doping rule violation under Article 2.1 (P resence of Prohibited Substa nce or its Metabolites or Makers) or Use of a Prohibited Substan ce or Prohibited Method under Article 2.2 that he or she bears No F ault or Ne gligence for the violation, the otherwise applicable period of Ineligibility shal l be elim inated. W hen a Prohibited Substance o r its Marke rs or Metabo lites is d etected in an Athlete's Spe cimen in violation of Article 2.1 (Presence of Prohi bited S ubstance). T he Athlete must also estab lish ho w the Prohib ited S ubstance entered his or her system in order to have the period of Ineligibility elim inated. In the even t this Article is applied a nd the period of I neligib ility otherwise a pplic able is eliminated, the anti-doping rule viola tion sh all not be co nsidered a violation for the Limited purpose of deter mining the period of Inelig ibility for multiple vio lations under Article 10.2, 10.3 and 10.6. (em phasis added). In the instant case, while the language of 10.5.1 specifically requires consideration of the circum stances of the first offense, no provision is made for a case in whic h the first o ffense predates the WADA Code and for which no findi ng of fault is required or even expected . This Panel is f aced with a req uirement to consider th e fault leve l of the f irst offense, withou t the benefit of any holding on that que stion due to the age of that case - but for which the P anel found no cheating or intent to cheat, and for whic h the IAAF \"elim inated\" the rem \"period of ineligibility o therwise app licable,\" w ith the active assistance of USADA. The IAAF did not elim inate the penalty. If ever there were a lacuna in the rules, and a unique set of facts, this case should qualify. Since it is 10.5.1. which m ust be addressed, the level of fault in the second offense is not relevant to the determ ination whether the first offense ought be treated as one. 8.21 USADA's argum ent that the P anel should not look beyond the face of the decision by the 2001 AAA Panel, is in conflict with its ow n position in this case. USADA has stipulated that it has co nsidered the fact a nd circum stances o f the first case, and argued in its brief and at Page 40 of 53 oral argum ents that Mr. Gatlin 's con duct in h is first vio lation com es unde r the standard of \"No tifying a reduction from a lifetime to an eight (8) year ban.45 However, the 2001 AAA Panel m ade no such finding (nor a finding of \"no fault\"). If the nature of the decision is to be analy zed and the result charac terized under the m odern rubric of the Code as it exists today, which is apparently what USADA itself has done, it should be the task of this Panel. 9.6 The Panel is sym pathetic to and credits USADA's argum ent that the 2001 case ought not be retried. The Panel has not done so and has in previous com munications with the parties, exp licitly se t out that it is not inte rested in doing so. Nor is this Panel co llaterally attacking the 2001 AAA Panel's inte rim decision. The Panel sees no reason to do so, even were it within the Panel's pow er, which it is not. Rather, the Panel has been asked to determine whether, f rom the langu age of the d ecision belo w, in light o f the tota lity of circum stances in the 2001 case, the 2001 AAA Panel can be considered essentially to have m ade a finding of \"no fault\" on the part of Mr. Gatlin (since USADA appears to co ncede that th e 2001 Panel should be held to have found at leas t \"no significant fault.\") 9.7 While the P anel credits USADA's ar guments concerning the problem s with unnecessarily com plicating or m ultiplying pro ceedings, m emory fading, the availability of evidence, th e righ t to ex pect a final decis ion and the like, the Panel is not retrying that case. Rather, the Panel has been asked to determ ine th e meaning of the reported decision, a process to which Mr. Gatlin is entitled given the s econd offense nature of the curren t matter46. To do otherwise w ould not be in accord with either the language or the inten t of the Code. 45 Transcript, supra, at pp. 42:6-46:5. See also, USADA Prehearing Brief a t 15. (\"... where one of the offenses involves 'n o significan t fault or negligence' ... th en the perio d of ineligibility is 8 years.\" 46 The Panel does not consi der the fact that Mr. Gatlin faces an 8 year ba n as oppose d to a lifetime ban, as alterin g its obligations in th is case. Page 41 of 53 9.8 While it has previously been quoted herein, the im portance of WADA Code provision 10.5.1 warrants its repetition: If the Athle te estab lishes in an ind ividual case involving an anti-doping rule violation under Article 2.1 (P resence of Prohibited Substa nce or its Metabolites or Makers) or Use of a Prohibited Substan ce or Prohibited Method under Article 2.2 that he or she bears No Fault or Negligence for the violation, the otherwise applicable period of Ineligibility shal l be elim inated. W hen a Prohibited Substance o r its Marke rs or Metabo lites is d etected in an Athlete's Spe cimen in violation of Article 2.1 (Presence of Prohi bited S ubstance). T he Athlete must also estab lish ho w the Prohib ited S ubstance entered his or her system in order to have the period of Ineligibility elim inated. In the ev ent this Artic le is applied an d the period of Ineligibility ot herwise applicable is elim inated, the anti-doping rule violation shall not be co nsidered a violation for the Lim ited purpose of determ ining the period of Ineligibility for m ultiple violations u nder Article 10.2, 10.3 and 10.6. 10.5.1 does not purport to exclude the ability of an athlete to establish no fault for a doping offe nse under an anti-doping regim e which predated its enactm ent, and the Panel finds that it would be inappropriate to construe such a lim itation into the plain language of the Code. In such a case, as with the case befo re this Pane l, it would be unfair and inequitable to hold that an athlete could not enjoy the privilege of 10.5.1, m erely because at the tim e of the first doping violation, there was no reason to m ake such a find ing as it was not cont emplated by the Code. That would create two classes of athletes, with tw o different sets of rights, based solely on an acciden t of tim ing. W hile this Pan el has not cred ited Mr. Gatlin's argum ents that that the first doping violation ought n ot be counted sim ply becau se it is too old, the Pan el conversely holds that it canno t ignore the exception of 10.5.1, simply because the first offense decision was too old. 9.9 USADA, despite its own position that M r. Gatlin has b een treated in this case as though there had been a finding of \"no significant fa ult,\" nevertheless argues that only the IAAF, pursuant to IAAF ADR 38.16, has the ability to de termine how that first violation should be Page 42 of 53 viewed. USADA argues that, should this Pa nel believe that the 2001 AAA Panel decision should be construed as having found \"no fault,\" it m ust then refer this m atter to the IAAF for a determ ination as to reinstatem ent for \"exceptional circum stances,\" m uch as was done in the first case. W hile Mr. Gatlin is free to do so, the Pane l respec tfully disagre es with the con clusion tha t this option divests the Panel of jurisdiction over the question. This Panel must m ake a determ inatio n in the first instan ce if it can do s o, and should n ot abdicate its respon sibility s imply because the issue m ay also be addressed by anoth er body or b ecause it is difficult. It is p recisely because of this obligation that the P anel found it self faced with the necessity of providing the parties with an opportunity to supplem ent the record to give the Panel the inform ation necess ary to accom plish th is analysis. W hile the record w as reopen ed, unfortunately neither party, and in particular Mr . Gatlin, was able to p rovide all the inf ormation sought by the Panel and what information was pr ovided, took longer than expected. T he Panel had expecte d that the re quest f or addition al information and argum ent would shed light on the nature of the finding in respect to the first offens e, but that expectation was dashed and the Panel cannot engage in speculation. 9.10 In addition, in the 2001 case, Mr. Ga tlin sp ecifically reques ted, and USADA agreed, to re fer the m atter to th e IAAF. Neither Mr. Gatlin nor USADA ha s made such a request in this case. The Panel cannot and will no t refe r the m atter to the IAAF without th e consent of the par ties. 47 9.11 Finally, USADA's argum ent that the Panel has been or could be influenced by one of its Panel m embers in construing that 2001 AAA Panel decision, is not well founded.

They are not witnesses, and in any event the Panel has not gone beyond the language of the 2001 AAA Panel decision and the r ecord events surrounding that decision. The Panel has not tried to go behind the facts of that decision. 9.12 Mr. Gatlin's first offense occurred in his first IAAF event in June of 2001. The WADA Code was not enacted 2001. There was no \"utm ost caution\" standard of care for a finding of no fault as presently exists under WADA Code 10.5.1. The standard of care was general negligence.48 As such, in evaluating his first offe nse, Mr. Gatlin had a substantive right to have the first violation evaluated under gene ral negligence, and the Panel sees no reason to conclude that was not done. 49 However, the Panel m ust be vig ilant not to confuse the issues. Hence, it cannot m erely rely on the observati ons of the 2001 AAA Panel as to the generally unintentional nature of the 2001 offe nse, to find that there was \"no fault\" under the \"utm ost caution\" standard. The exception to the im position of an enhanced penalty when the first offense was found to be a \"no fault\" offense, is base d on the current WADA Code, which requires that the \"no fault\" finding be under the prevailing \"u tmost caution\" standar d, not the old, sim ple negligence standard. 9.13 The negligence standard m ay be expressed as follows: \"the failure to do something which a reasonably careful person w ould do, or the doing of som ething which a reasonably careful person would not do. Ford Motor Co. v. Burdeshaw (1995) 661 So. 2d 236, 238. 48 This was an ad mission of USAD A in a tribu nal proceeding. USADA in Neben v.

Page 44 of 53 9.14 Mr. Gatlin has argued that the USATF Manual in effect in 2001 included references for the use of athletes suffering fro m ADD, but th at the specific reference did not state that an athlete suffering from ADD should seek a TUE exem ption. He does not address the question whether the Manual otherwise desc ribes the process and direct at hletes g enerally to s eek a therapeutic use exem ption if th ey are taking any product which m ight result in a finding of a doping violation. Nor does Mr. Gatlin argue that the USATF Manual advises athletes that they need not seek a physician's guidance or that any specific period of di scontinuance would be sufficient that a doping violation wi ll not be found. This is one of the docum ents specifically requested by the Panel so that it cou ld be reviewed in ligh t of the argum ents being raised. It was not produced despite the granting of am ple opportunity to so produce. 9.15 Mr. Gatlin has also argued that the alleged advice by USAT F to discontinue any problem atic m edication prior to competition wa s echoed by USADA. Mr. Gatlin a rgues tha t USADA ad vised on its website that an athlete suffering fro m ADD shoul d discontinue use of his or her m edication prior to an event. Once ag ain, however, Mr. Gatlin does not allege that USADA m ade any representations that m ere cessation would be su fficient to avoid a finding of a doping violation, or that it would re sult in a negative urine test, or that any particular period of cessation pr ior to com petition would be conside red sufficient. Once again , this is a pie ce of evidence f or which the P anel exp ressly reopen ed the re cord in this c ase, but to no ava il as it was not produced. 9.16 While the P anel does not have either th e USATF or the USADA m aterials in the record, it is undisputed that Mr. Gatlin did not seek from IAAF a therapeutic use exem ption for his m edication50, and his position can be described as a lack of knowledge that he needed one, and that he followed practices of other athletes or coaches. It is also apparently undisputed, and 50 See also, the 2001 Panel decision at pa ragra ph 8. Page 45 of 53 was found by the 2001 Panel, that Mr. Gatlin had di sclosed his m edications to representatives fo the Univers ity of Tennessee, where h e was enrolle d and behalf of which he com peted at the tim e of his positive test in 20 01. (2001 Decision at \u00b68.) 9.17 Nevertheless, Mr. Gatlin stated in his 2002 petition for reinstatem ent that he had received a \"... notice co ncerning the potential us e of prohibited substances. This notice, which he filled ou t and turned in approxim ately three m onths bef ore the even t, merely state d that an individual taking prescription m edicine should contact USADA.\" (at 4) 2There is nothing in the record before this Panel which would indiate that Mr. Gatlin com plied with the adv ice and \"contac t[ed] USADA,\" nor tha t the notice \"whic h he filled o ut and tu rned in\" dis closed use of the prohibited am pheta mine. 9.18 The parties did produce the IAAF Proce dural Guidelines for Doping Control, 2000 Editio n, which contained bo th an anti-doping provision (Rule 55): 55.2 The offence of doping takes place when . . .: (i) a prohibited substance is found to be present within an athlete's body ... fluids; 55.5 An athlete m ay Comm ission to grant prior exem ption allowing him to take a substance norm ally prohibited under IAAF Rules. Such an exem ption will only b e granted in c ases of clear and com pelling c linical need. Details of the procedure for such an application are to be found in the \"Procedural Guidelines for Doping Control\". and the \"Procedural Guidelines for Dopi ng Control\" contains a specific TUE provision, which reads as f ollows: 5.1 IAAF Rules 55.5 was introduced in orde r to m ake it possible for an athlete to participate in sport who, for a lim ited or prolonged period of tim e, needs a prohibited substance for m edical reasons . 5.2 Exem ption will no t, therefore, no rmally be granted in cas es of acute d isease and never when sporting activity m ay be h azardous to the ath lete. Exem ptions, consequently, will be g ranted only r arely and in very spec ial cases. Page 46 of 53 5.3 Out-Of-Com petitio n doping co ntrol is used as a deterrent for the us e of anabolic agents and certain listed horm ones, including the substances under prohibited techniques. A pplication for exception of drug use during training is, therefore, n eeded only for these substances. 9.19 In 2001, Mr. Gatlin was suffering from a legitim ate disability and51 he was properly taking his m edication under a doctor's p rescription that an internationa l panel of experts determ ined was appropriate. He stopped taking hi s medication three (3) days before the even t as established by the experts. 9.20 It does not appear beyond doubt that Mr . Gatlin would have been found by the Panel to be at least contributorily negligent to som e extent for hi s first offense in 2001. There is no evidence that the three (3) days w as the period of tim e recommended by his physician52. Although it was recommended that he stop taking the substance prior to com peting, the record is blank with respect to whether it was solely up to the athlete to determ ine the am ount of tim e necessary for the subs tance to clear h is system , or if an anti-doping agency advised him of such a time period. Mr. Gatlin has failed to provide any evidence as to why he chose three (3) days, or even that he consulted a phys ician regarding that choice53. It proved to be an insufficient period of tim e. 51 Bing ham v. Orego n School Activities Asso ciation (1998) 24 F. Supp. 2d 1110,1116 (recognized ADD as a disability u nder federal law). 52 To the contrary, in his petition to th e IAAF for reinstatem ent for the 2001 offen se, Mr. Gatlin states th at his physician \"h as been un able to determine the proper am ount of time....\" (at 3) Moreo ver, Mr. Gatlin further admitted in that petition, that he understoo d that literatu re at th e tim e cited as a \"ru le of thu mb,\" a p eriod of \"2 -4 days...,\" th at the period will vary depending a range of factors, and that even th e \"2-4 \" day period could refer to reducution of amphetimin e detectio n down to a lev el still m uch higher than that permitted under IAAF Ru les. (Id.) 53 While Mr. Gatlin 's physician apparently was cited in his IAAF petition in 2002, there is no indicatio n that those question s were ev en asked at th e tim e of the first doping offense. M oreover, the 2001 Pan el Decisio n points out that \"Mr. Gatlin 's do ctor did not know h ow far in advan ce of competing mr. Gatlin should stop takin g his medication.) (2001 Deci sion at \u00b69). Page 47 of 53 9.21 Under these facts, the 2001 Panel's fi nding of a doping violation and a tentative award of a two (2) year ban could54 suggest th at the 2001 AAA Panel found that M r. Gatlin bo re some responsibility for governing his own ac tions. Had the 2001 Panel found that the USATF and/or USADA had affirm atively m isled Mr. Gat lin into a well founded belief that a three day cessation was sufficient under the R ules then in force, it m ight have found that there was no violation as Mr. Gatlin would have been in full com pliance with the Rules55. The Panel did not do so, nor did it find that Mr. Gatlin had \"no ne gligence\" (the standard at the tim e), nor that either sports organization had m ade repres entations that a th ree day period was suffi cient. This does not m ean, of course, that thes e facts did not occur, just that there is no evidence of them in the re cords a vailab le to this Panel. By the sam e token, the P anel notes that it is undisputed that the 2001 AAA Panel made no finding that Mr. Gatlin had any fault, either. Rather, that 2001 panel applied IAAF Rul es56: 55.2 ...doping takes place when ...(i) a prohibi ted substance is found to be present within an athlete's body tissue or fluids.... 60.2: If an athlete comm its a doping offence, he will b e ineligible for the following periods: (a) for an offence ... involving the substan ces lis ted in Part I of Schedule 1 of the Procedural Guidelines for Doping Control\".... (i) first offence - for a m inimum of two years .... 60.8 In exception circum stances, an athlete m ay apply to the Council for re-instatem ent before the IAAF's period of ineligibility has expired ... it is em phasized that only tru ly exception al circumstances will jus tify any reduction. 54 The Panel uses this cautionary language in that, on its face, th e 2001 AAA Pan el decision indicates t hat the totality o f its pro ceedings was \"[a] one hour telephonic hearing....\" 55 Again, in his 2002 petition to the IAAF, Mr. Gatlin states that n either the USOC nor USADA had provided any s pecific inform ation on the am ount of time prior to c ompetition that Mr. Gatlin would have to cea se us of his medicatio n in order not to test p ositive. (at 3) 56 2001 Decision at \u00b67 Page 48 of 53 9.22 Indeed, the record indicates that USADA c oopera ted with Mr. Gatlin's reins tatem ent, becaus e it felt he had \"no significa nt fault,\" no t because it felt he h ad \"no fault.\"57 However, neither the tentative holding of the 2001 Panel nor th e cooperation of USADA changes the nature of the standard under which that case was decided. 9.23 The questio n for this Panel is wheth er, in light o f the totality of circum stances and the findings of the 2001 AAA Panel's decision, that decision can be construed as being the equivalent of a \"no fault\" finding under the \"utm ost caution\" standard, rather then m erely the \"neglig ence\" standard. The Pane l concludes tha t while the c ircumstances and facts as they existed in 2001 m ight (or m ight not) have resu lted in a \"no fault\" conclusion by the 2001 AAA Panel, that P anel was not called upon and did not m ake such a finding. 9.24 However, the 2001 Panel did m ake th e following holdings and observations: \"[Mr. Gatlin ] did ... disc lose his p rescription m edicine to his doctor a t the University o f Tennessee. \" (at \u00b68) \"Based on the m edical experts' opinion in th is case, it is not u nreasonab le for this Panel to assum e that, if requested, the exem ption likely would have been granted.\" (at \u00b69) \"This l would chara cterize M r. Gatlin 's inadverten t violation of the IAAF's rules ... as, at m ost, a \"technical\" rsonal culp (Id). Mr. Gatlin's \"culpab ility\" is \"propo rtionate ly very m uch less than other athletes who would receive a two year suspen sion under the sam e IAAF rules.\" (Id). \"Were this P anel to addr ess the issue of culpability and sanctions in a full evidentiary hearing, this panel clearly would not apply the full two-year suspension to Mr. Gatlin.\" (at II.3). 57 The Panel notes th at the Pan el in Puerta, after extolling the \"extraordina ry manner\"i n which an accidental contamination occu rred, to water which Mr. Puerta carried with him to avoid contamination, nevertheless found that \"Mr. Pu erta fai led to exercise the \"utmost cau tion\" at th is critical ti me. In th is instance, th e first offense by Mr. Gatlin was fail ure to follow proper pro cedu res to record and seek exemption for a known am phetamine product. While Mr. Gatlin argu es that the specific drug was not listed by name in the IAAF R ules, th ere is no dispute that amphetamines are listed as a categ ory and that Mr. Gatlin knew enou gh to register h is medicatio n with his University. Page 49 of 53 \"Anti-dop ing rules a re like other spo rting rule s in that som etimes there ar e adverse con sequences even when an athlete is not at fault.\" (at II.9). While the foregoing observations and holdings clearly evidence that the 2001 Panel was not in accord with a two year suspension, they do not arise to the level of a finding of \"no fault.\" The Panel merely s tated that it \"assu that Mr. Gatlin cou ld have received a TUE; that h is violation, w hile technical, was neve rtheless a violation; that his cu lpability could be disputed, not that he had none; that his culpab ility was \"very much less than\" ot her athletes, not that there was \"no\" culpab ility; and th at the Panel w ould pr efer to apply le ss than \"th e full two-yea r suspension,\" not that it w ould im pose no suspension. 9.25 By the sam e token, it does not appear that the 2001 AAA Pa nel ever m ade a final decision in that case, deferring to the IAAF for a decision. The IAAF m ade no decision at all as to fault, but did imm ediately reinstate Mr . Gatlin without any additional period of disqualification, other than that already served. To do so, it a ppears that the IAAF had to find that \"exceptional circumstances \" justified the rein statem ent of Mr. Gatlin and the avo idance of the tentative holding of a two (2) year suspension by the 2001 Panel.58 9.26 The Panel, though having held that there is no evidence at present in the record to justify a finding of \"no fault\" under the \"utm ost caution\" standard, strongly urges the parties, and adjures USADA to coo perate as it did in the past, to rectify this gap in the record. The Panel holds that the burden to show \"no fault\" in the fi rst offense is Mr. Gatlin's and it sim ply has not been m et. The Panel does not m ake any finding th at \"fault\" was or shoul d be found in the first offense. In doing so, Mr. Gatlin m ay seek to pr esent th e requ isite evid ence before an appeal 58 USADA has haracterize d this reinstatem ent as a \"re duction\" in the ban from two years t o one, rather than a vacat ing of the finding of a first offense . Page 50 of 53 panel, or m ay seek to clarify the actions of the IAAF in deciding his reinstatem ent. 59 If the IAAF \"elim inated\" any period of ineligibility beca use it believed that, under the circum stances either there should have been no finding of a doping violation or because Mr. Gatlin h ad \"no fault\" in that violation, then th e first offense should not be consid ered to be a prior offense for purposes of the award for a second violation. This Panel is unable, on the record before it, to ignore the first doping violation, but shall retain jurisdiction to am end this award in the event that Mr. Gatlin receives from IAAF or otherwise, a ruling which might alter the view of the first offense in 2001. 10. Decision and Award On the basis of the foregoing facts and le gal aspe cts, th is Pan el rend ers th e following decision: 10.1 Respondent has comm itted a doping vi olation un der the W ADA Code, Article 10.2, by reason of the use of exoge nous testosterone in 2006. 10.2 The 2006 doping violation was Respondent's second doping offense. 10.3 There was no finding of the nature, leve l or existence of \"fau lt\" as to the first doping violation, either by the 2001 AAA Panel in 2001, which referred the m atter for a final determ ination to the IAAF, nor by IAAF in 2002 when it decided th at such \"excep tional circum stanc es\" the imm ediate rein statement of Mr. Gatlin. 10.4 It therefore f alls to this Panel to construe the language of and the record in that prior doping offense decision, to determ ine if it qualifies as the equivalent of a \"no fault\" 59 While th is Panel makes no holding as to the fact th at the first p anel in 2001 retain ed jurisd iction over that doping offen se, it no tes th at fact an d the fact that the Panel neve r issued a \"final\" decision nor ot herwise repudiated its jurisdiction . Page 51 of 53 determ inatio n such as to justif y not counting it as a first offense, solely for purposes of the award for a second offense. 10.5 The lack of requested evidence, finding by the 2001 AAA Pa nel of a doping violation, the nature of the sta ndard applied in 2001, and the actio ns of the IAAF clearly suggest at a m inimum, a finding of \"no significant fault\" in 2001. However, there is no evidence from which this Panel m ay determ ine that a finding of \"no fault\" under the current WADA standard was m ade or could be inf erred. 10.6 Therefore, the totality of circum stance s causes the Panel to conclude that the 2001 decision of the AAA Pan el and the 2002 decision of the IAAF cannot be construed, on the record before this P anel, as cons tituting a \"n o fault\" le vel of responsibility on the part of the R espondent under Code section 10.5.1. 10.7 The following sanctions shall be im posed on Respondent: A four-year period of in eligibility commencing on May 25, 2006 through May 24, 2010, including his ineligibility from partic ipating in U.S. Olym pics Gam es, tria ls or qua lifying events, being a m ember of any U.S. Olym pic, Pan Am erica o r Paralym pics Gam es team and having access to the training f acilities of the United Sta tes Olym pic Comm ittee Training Centers or other program s and activiti es of the USOC including, but not lim ited to, grants, awards, or employm ent pursuant to the USOC Anti-Doping Policies. 10.8 The retroactive cancellation of all com petitions results and aw ards occurring after April 22, 2006 through the date of this Award. 10.9 The adm inistrative fees and expenses of the Am erican Arbi tration Association $750.00 and the com pensation and expenses of the arbitrators shall be borne by the C laimant. 10.10 This Award is in full reso lution of all claim s subm itted in or which could have been subm itted in this A rbitration. All claim s not expres sly granted h ere are herby d enied.
