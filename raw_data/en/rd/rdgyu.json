The work presented here represents a small step towards better understanding of why some children remain unvaccinated, and why some vaccines fail to produce immunity. The approach, from the onset, was intended to be more integrated than conventional research.

Qualitative research methods were employed to synthesize that systematic review into a testable hypothesis. Using innovative survey data, that hypothesis is immediately put to use to measure key determinants quantitatively in Uganda and Zambia. To bolster the results, a novel data processing method was developed that enhances the accuracy and utility of serological data. Finally, this study presents the results of a Bayesian structural equation model that represents determinants of vaccine coverage, and explores the implications of the ndings. The key ndings give a rigorous, quantitative account that determinants of effective coverage are different depending on context. In Uganda and Zambia, the results show that there is a set of barriers to whether or not a child receives their initial dose of a vaccine, and those are largely different than the barriers to completion of the full dosage schedule. Further still, the challenges associated with newly-introduced vaccines such as pneumococcal conjugate vaccine are different than either initiation or drop-out. More specically, this analysis nds that access- related barriers are key to vaccine initiation, demand-related determinants are key to drop-out, and supply-side constraints are key to new vaccines. There are two important implications of these results. First, programs that seek the intervene on a particular barrier, such as demand generation activities or health system strengthening, can use this study to identify the most appropriate outcome to measure their performance. More importantly, vaccination programs in Uganda and Zambia can use these ndings to better target new interventions, and continue progress against vaccine preventable diseases. 11 C H A P T E R 1 D E T E R M I N A N T S O F E F F E C T I V E VA C C I N E C O V E R A G E I N L O W A N D M I D D L E - I N C O M E C O U N T R I E S : A S Y S T E M AT I C R E V I E W A N D I N T E R P R E T I V E S Y N T H E S I S 1.1 introduction Childhood vaccinations are among the most effective and cost effective public health inter- ventions available.1,2Yet, vaccine-preventable diseases caused approximately 14% of disability- adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2015 globally, and 15% of DALYs in Sub-Saharan Africa.3 Many children remain unimmunized. Global coverage of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccination ranges from 74% in Africa to 96% in Europe.4Despite progress, socio-economic in- equalities persist as well.5Furthermore, vaccines do not always produce immunity. For example, vaccination against measles has been estimated to be 85% effective in the United States and 66% effective in Mozambique.6,7 Extensive research effort has been devoted to understanding why vaccine coverage remains low, and why vaccines sometimes fail to produce immunity. Quantitative studies have sought to measure determinants using survey and other data. Systematic reviews have been published on both vaccination and immunization in order to gather studies together.8-14Some have taken ad- ditional steps to develop a conceptual framework, i.e. general model for thinking about how de- terminants t together.8,11Others assess health systems, describing bottlenecks and constraints to successful vaccine delivery from the supply-side, for example the World Health Organiza- tion's Health Systems Building Blocks framework.15 Most studies and systematic reviews have been limited in breadth and depth however. Stud- ies seeking to directly measure determinants are rarely based on a grounded theoretical model such as a conceptual framework from systematic review. Systematic reviews focusing on vaccine coverage have only covered a subset of the published research. Reviews on vaccine effectiveness haven't offered a complete account of potential determinants; they instead focus on a few im- portant factors. Conceptual frameworks are mostly untestable in a quantitative sense, and are therefore unusable to independent researchers with new data to analyze. Most conceptual frame- works rely on narrative description of determinants more than explicit depiction the pathways and interactions through which they are thought to influence immunization. Public health practitioners and vaccine researchers would benet from a systematic review and synthesis of determinants research. A complete listing of previous studies would be valu- able as a standalone resource. One of the most challenging aspects of developing an evidence- based conceptual framework is simply amassing information to synthesize. Efforts to make sense of the literature could yield useful hypotheses, even competing hypotheses, about how determinants lead to immunization. Future studies could collect data to measure the hypothe- sized constructs, and model them to quantify the relative impact of different determinants in a more grounded way. Interventions could leverage such information to target determinants of greater need and evaluate programs with outcomes that are t for purpose to enhance their efforts to improve immunization around the world. 2The objectives of this study are twofold. First, we aim to document the existing evidence on determinants of childhood vaccination and determinants of immunization. Second, we aim to generate a conceptual framework. This will summarize, as succinctly as possible, determinants of effective vaccine coverage and relationships between them, and represent it in the form of a testable hypothesis. We accomplish the rst goal by conducting a novel systematic review of reasons for non-vaccination and reasons for vaccine failure. For the second goal, we perform three qualitative analyses on the information in the review, using critical interpretive synthesis dened in Dixon-Woods et al. 2006 .16 1.2 methods The systematic review and synthesis involved ve separate, interrelated steps. Each step is described in detail in the subsequent sections. Briefly, these are 1) literature search, 2) data extraction, 3) content analysis, 4) thematic analysis and 5) interpretive synthesis. The approach to each stage was planned in advance, including a clear objective and specically-dened criteria in an effort to ensure rigor and reproducibility. 1.2.1Literature Search and Data Extraction The literature search procedure is described in detail in Appendix A (Chapter 4). A preliminary review was used to develop a set of search terms and otherwise inform the more structured liter- ature search. All potential search terms (used or not) are listed in Appendix 2. Eligibility criteria were dened in advance (Appendix A (Chapter 4)). Google Scholar searches were performed sequentially and the rst 500results from each term were screened for inclusion. Additionally, two PubMed searches with multiple MeSH terms (see Appendix 2), nine special databases17-21 (e.g. Cochrane Library, EPPI Centre) and citations from nine other systematic reviews9,10,13,22-27 were screened in their entirety. All articles were catalogued in a citation database and evaluated for relevance, using pre- determined relevance criteria (Appendix A (Chapter 4)). Data were extracted from articles in descending order of relevance. The goal of this stage was to itemize the content of the most relevant articles, including ve variables related to study characteristics and nine variables re- lated to study content. A digital color-coding system was used to ensure transparency and reproducibility. Data were transcribed into a spreadsheet for analysis. 1.2.2Content Analysis Content analysis was performed to make sense of the itemized determinants from data extraction.28,29 The objective of this stage was to document and organize the data, specically focusing on the determinants and pathways identied in the literature. All discrete determinants mentioned in the extracted data were listed and systematically ex- amined. This was done by maintaining a running list of determinants, meaning content analysis and data extraction were concurrent with each other, rather than sequential. The list of determi- nants, as well as the text from which they were extracted, was repeatedly revisited to understand the context in which those determinants were described. Synonymous determinants and deter- minants with negligible conceptual differences were condensed into a common set of terms. 3Finally, a frequency table of determinants was created, and related pathways were explored, starting with the most frequently-cited determinants. The output from this stage was represented in a path diagram intended to represent the universe of determinants, according to the literature. 1.2.3Thematic Analysis Thematic analysis was carried out to document the broader qualitative groups (i.e. themes) within which determinants are hypothesized to reside.28,30The objectives of this stage were to describe the ways in which authors most commonly categorize determinants, and to bring together similar categorizations into three to ve broad frameworks. Thematic analysis was accomplished by relying on the authors' descriptions. The categories they used to group together determinants were listed along with excerpts of text in which they were described. Like content analysis, this was done in an iterative fashion, seeking patterns between studies. It was anticipated that some studies would cite a more generalized sociological or health system theory as the source for their themes. In the event that multiple studies cited the same generalized theory those citations were also examined and included in the thematic analysis. 1.2.4Interpretive Synthesis The third analysis was interpretive synthesis of the literature, following guidelines from Dixon- Woods et al 2006 .16This stage entailed critical analysis of the determinants identied through content analysis and categorizations identied through thematic analysis. The objective of this phase was to formulate a conceptual framework that draws from other researchers' frameworks, and represent it in the form of a testable hypothesis. Key methods in interpretive synthesis are known as reciprocal translational analysis (RTA), refutational synthesis and lines-of-argument synthesis (LOA), and are adapted from meta- ethno- graphical research.16,31,32RTA expands on the processes already described in the previous two sections (Thematic Analysis and Content Analysis). In short, RTA involves identifying broad concepts (themes) reported in each study, and identifying similarities between them. Refu- tational synthesis involves the opposite process; contradictions between studies (in terms of themes or descriptions of themes) are explored. This process lends insight to a conceptual frame- work by elucidating the gaps and discrepancies between studies in such a way that produces novel perspectives on common concepts. The nal method (LOA) involves the most interpretive input on the part of the researcher. LOA entails integrating strongly-supported factors across studies and attempting to form a synthesizing argument, or a description of how they t to- gether, that is both succinct and understandable to commonplace audiences. The synthesizing argument often includes the generation of synthetic constructs, sometimes referred to as latent variables. Information for interpretive synthesis came from multiple sources. Other studies which of- fered their own conceptual framework were used, as well as lessons from Thematic Analysis described above. In addition, broader theories which have been applied to describe health ser- vice utilization and health system strength were used. The ultimate testable hypothesis developed in this stage was also formulated through an iter- ative process, repeatedly revisiting previously-documented themes as new studies were exam- 4ined for further comparisons and contrasts. This stage also relied heavily on broader sociological and health systems theories to offer formalized and grounded structure. 1.3 results 1.3.1Literature Search A total of 35web-searches were performed, including Google Scholar ( 14searches), PubMed ( 2 searches) special databases backward citations ( 10articles). In total, 9,041titles were examined for inclusion. Of those, 1,621 eligible articles were identied, 12studies were re-publications of another article (with a different name or publisher) and were excluded. All1,609included articles were assessed for relevance based on title and abstract, resulting in 105highly relevant articles (relevance score >0.9),362moderately relevant articles (relevance score>0.8and<0.9) and 1,142less-relevant articles (relevance score <0.8). The complete list of1,609citations can be found in Appendix A (Chapter 4), organized by relevance. 1.3.2Content Analysis Content was extracted from 78articles, the characteristics of which are detailed in Appendix A (Chapter 4). A wide array of determinants were documented among the extracted articles, totaling 638uniquely-worded factors. By iteratively revisiting the list of determinants and ex- amining the context in which they were described, a condensed framework of 69coverage determinants and 20effectiveness determinants was developed. By examining the described pathways between determinants, 115pathways of influence were identied, forming a compre- hensive network of vaccine coverage. An additional 22pathways of influence were identied for vaccine effectiveness. The complete network of effective coverage determinants are listed in Tables 1and2, and displayed visually in Figure 1. 5Table 1: List of determinants to vaccine coverage Determinant Description

The ways in which authors grouped together determinants were documented, and excerpts related to those themes were examined. This especially focused on the denition and justication of each theme according to the author. Authors' descriptions regarding interactions between themes were also exam- ined. Often, conceptualizations of thematic groups were not precisely justied. Instead, authors tended to use thematic groups as a convenient way to summarize their approach, reflecting their preconceptions about a theory of determinants. Of the 78extracted articles, 41relied on thematic groups. Three major themes emerged from this analysis. One common thematic framework can be de- scribed as proximity. Authors who relied on proximity tended to group together determinants in terms of whether they were thought to directly impact vaccine coverage, or whether they were thought to impact vaccine coverage through a mediating factor. For example, Gauri and Kalenghian ( 2002 ) describe very high-level political, economic and social determinants in con- trast to individual-level demand and acceptance, with accompanying description of the mech- anisms of mediation.33A common variant of this theme was \"environment\" or whether deter- minants occurred at the point of care, in the household or in the community (or elsewhere). Another common theme can be described as patient-centric. Numerous studies went into thor- ough detail conceptualizing the differences between determinants on the \"demand side\", and tended to group all other determinants as \"health system factors\". Chen ( 1986 ) for example pro- vides a useful example of patient-centric themes, in which a richness of information is provided about \"biosocial\" and \"demand/utilization\" factors, but health system factors are described with greater ambiguity, focusing on the high-level structure of the health system without any further detail.34In contrast, other themes can be described as health system-centric, wherein more at- tention is given to themes on the \"supply side\", and most other determinants are classied as \"demand factors\". One example is Naimoli et al 2008 , who report four themes and 18determi- nants relating to the health system, but only one theme with very little detail to describe all of demand.35 Some areas of overlap emerged between themes. Interestingly, it was noted that the \"health system factors\" from demand-centric themes, and the \"demand factors\" from health system- centric themes often referred to the same thing: a more intermediate class of determinants that could be described as access or ability (both physical access and resource capacity). For example, Agot 2014 duly emphasizes the health system, but describes health system factors as distance and cost incurred to the patient. While these can be considered characteristics of the health system, they may usefully described as barriers to interaction between the child's caretaker and the health workers. Figure 2displays the proximity theme mapped to the content analysis. Appendix 2displays the patient-centric and health system-centric themes, demonstrating the ways in which each theme is more comprehensive in certain areas than others. 12Figure 2: Network of determinants to vaccine effective coverage 131.3.4Interpretive Synthesis The third analysis conducted using the information from systematic review was interpretive syn- thesis. Interpretive synthesis followed the approach outlined by Dixon-Woods et al. 200616, with the goal of generating a succinct and testable depiction of factors leading to vaccination. This entailed further comparison of themes, as well as integration of existing conceptual frameworks. This approach was used because it details suitable a process for accomplishing the primary goal, beyond that of other approaches examined.16 Three other conceptual frameworks were explored in depth. The earliest framework found in the literature was described by Rudner-Lugo 1993 .8This model largely builds on the Health Be- lief Model36, and describes perceived cost versus benet of vaccination as the deciding determi- nant of vaccine utilization. The author depicts four demand-side factors and three supply-side factors contributing to that cost-benet assessment. This author suggests numerous measurable indicators that can be used to measure each factor, and even carries out a regression analysis based on the framework. The second conceptual framework was put forward by Katz et al. 2010 .37These authors used systematic review and previous health behavior theories to generate what they title the Vaccine Perceptions, Accountability and Adherence Model. This model places additional emphasis on \"cultural and economic forces\", while also recognizing the importance of barriers and \"structural factors\". The authors propose numerous contributing factors for each of the major elements in the model, but do not go so far as to suggest specic indicators that might represent them. The third framework was proposed by LaFond et al 2014 .11These authors offer a drastically different framework, focusing heavily on community engagement, awareness and commitment from high-level institutions such as government and development partners. Based on a series of case studies, LaFond et al provide rich discussion on the pathways through which key drivers operate, but lack description of contributing factors, interdependencies and specic indicators. The conceptual framework we present draws lessons, similarities and differences from each of the above frameworks. The Rudner-Lugo framework lays out a useful structure of demand and supply-side factors coming together to lead to utilization, each with distinct contributing factors. The Katz et al. framework adds extended background to demand-side factors, especially with emphasis on perception-related decision making rather than strictly economic choices. Further still, the LaFond model brings an emphasis on community-level factors which was captured by neither of the other two. Finally, our own thematic analysis (as discussed above) identied an important third construct between supply and demand: one relating to access and barriers to access. Taken together, we depict a framework based around three synthetic constructs: 1) health facility readiness to administer vaccines, 2) community-level access and 3) intention (on the part of the mother or caretaker) to vaccinate the child. General theories of health service utilization were used to describe contributors to the three primary constructs. Contributing factors for Health Facility Readiness were identied using the World Health Organization's Health System Building Blocks Framework.15This framework de- scribes supply of essential medicines and health workforce as the most proximal components of a successful health system.15Contributing factors to Intent to Vaccinate were identied based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, a highly-cited behavior change model for health service utilization.38According to this theory, the three contributing factors to intent are attitudes, per- ceived norms, and perceived control, which is sometimes described as perceived self-efcacy. The resulting framework is depicted in Figure 3. The framework hypothesizes three principal determinants of vaccine utilization: 14Figure 3: Conceptual framework for vaccine coverage \u000fIntent to Vaccinate - Demand for vaccines on the part of the mother that would result in vaccination in the absence of other barriers. \u000fFacility Readiness - Supply (by the health system) of vaccine services to adequately meet demand. Incorporates supplies (vials, syringes etc.), human resources and the consistency of their availability. \u000fCommunity Access - The ability (or inability) to successfully carry out the transaction of vaccine utilization, i.e. barriers and facilitators between Intent and Readiness. This framework represents the three principal determinants in their most simplied form; as separate and distinct from one another. This was done in order to accomplish the main objective of producing a testable hypothesis, but does not preclude analysis of these constructs with correlation. 1.4 discussion This study presents the most comprehensive systematic review of vaccine determinants to date. We performed three qualitative analyses and synthesized the information we gathered into an evidence-based conceptual framework. The key advantages of the conceptual framework are that it is designed to be exhaustive, succinct and testable. This study has limitations however. Although the network of determinants (Figure 1) is in- tended to be comprehensive, one limitation of this study is completeness. There are four reasons why this study may not be considered complete. First, it is only complete within the context of the scientic literature. Any determinants that have been systematically overlooked by other researchers will not be present here. Second, the systematic review did not include studies of specic interventions to improve vaccine coverage, just research on determinants. Because of 15this, there is potential for our analyses to exclude potentially influential information. Third, it is only complete within a certain degree of proximity to utilization. One could continue to ar- gue that each determinant has its own preceding determinants ad innitum . While this may be true, it is clearly not the goal of this research to describe the entire spectrum of socioeconomic forces, thus only reasonably proximal determinants were described. Last, despite going to great lengths to uncover as many relevant articles as possible, it may be that some research studies were simply missed. With a citation list of 1,621 articles however, we are condent that such studies are few. Two other potential limitations stem from the implementation of the review and synthesis. First, the entire study (web searches, review, analysis and synthesis) was conducted by a single researcher. While it would have been ideal to rely on multiple reviewers and assessment of inter-rater reliability, that was not feasible for this study. Second, this review did not include a formal statistical meta-analysis. The exclusion of meta-analysis was intentional for two reasons. First it was anticipated that the studies included in the review would be heterogeneous and observational. Omitted variable bias and observer-expectancy effects in such a diverse base of studies make meta-analysis intractable. Second, a primary objective of this study was to synthesize the literature into a testable hypothesis. Some of the most informative studies for that goal were qualitative and were not t for meta-analysis. Limitations notwithstanding, this systematic review has a key advantages over previous re- views. First, no previous systematic review has been exhaustive. For reviews to examine factors associated with vaccine coverage, but none of the reviews captured any of the others. Second, none of these studies examine the factors which impact the effectiveness of vaccines. On the contrary, Patriarca 199112, Akande 200713and Cherry 201214explore reasons behind the effectiveness of vaccines but not utilization, and only focus on a subset of deter- minants. Beyond these, there are hundreds of studies which consider factors relating to either utilization or effectiveness but are not exhaustive in terms of the reasons they explore. The conceptual framework presented here has advantages over previous frameworks as well. First, it represents a synthesis of multiple existing frameworks. Our analysis draws the most use- ful characteristics from each of them to avoid gaps that disadvantage other frameworks. Second, it was designed to be applicable in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Among the two previous systematic reviews which offer a framework8,11, only one of them focuses on LMICs, and that framework focuses on only a select few determinants.11Third, the conceptual frame- work presented here integrates the Theory of Planned Behavior and the WHO Building Blocks models. Both are vetted, tested models, the former of which has quantitatively outperformed other theories in direct comparisons.39Finally, this framework was designed to be quantitatively testable, an absent characteristic in at least some other frameworks. With appropriate data, the constructs in this framework could be directly represented using latent variable analysis. Future data collection and analysis plans could take advantage of a pre-existing conceptual framework to be more grounded in existing research. This study offers important contributions to the understanding of routine childhood vaccina- tion in low and middle income countries. One is simply the list of studies it identied (Appendix 3). We consider this to be a useful public resource in its own right. Now that a near-complete list of studies exists, future researchers can perform their own qualitative analysis and develop competing conceptual frameworks with greater ease. Another contribution is the conceptual framework. Future quantitative researchers can use this study to identify appropriate indicators to analyze and to dene their theoretical model. By bringing together the collective evidence on 16the drivers of immunization, this review lends itself to better research in the future, further un- derstanding of determinants, and greater progress against vaccine preventable diseases around the world. 171.5 references 1.

A popular sample collection technique is dried blood spot (DBS) samples, i.e. drops of capillary blood from a nger-stick blotted onto lter paper and dried.3-5DBS studies are increasingly common in resource-limited settings because they are often less expensive and logistically challenging than studies involving liquid blood.6-8DBS studies are limited in their comparability however, owing to a lack of standardized protocols and a range of challenges in sample collection and assaying.9-11 Measurement error in DBS data, i.e. largely uncontrollable differences between samples that contribute to stochastic variation, may come from a variety of sources. Importantly, some sources of measurement error impact individual samples, while others affect groups of samples or entire studies. For example, sample-specic measurement error may affect individual measurements through variability in the sample collection on a sample-by-sample basis. However, many parts of the assay protocol refer to whole assay plates, such as incubation time and mixing of fluids among others. These plate-level factors mean groups of samples could have stochastically higher or lower values. At the highest level, differences in data collection, assay protocols, laboratory facilities and data analysis may hinder comparisons between studies. Many of these challenges are compounded by the technical and logistical difculties of multi-national studies in resource- limited settings.12 An important analytical step after DBS data collection is conversion from direct measurements to actual concentration of antibodies in the blood, plasma or serum of the study participant. For example, analyses conducted using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) estimate optical density (OD) of color change which must be translated into a biologically-relevant metric such as plasma concentration. The common approach to conversion is to generate a \"standard curve\", or best-t line between OD and plasma concentration using DBS samples for which the actual plasma concentration is reliably known.13The standard curve is used across all samples to nd the equivalent plasma concentration for every OD value. Figure 4demonstrates the typical use of a standard curve. A concern in DBS studies is uncertainty in the standard curve itself though. In our study for example, the slope of one standard curve had a condence interval of +/- 11%. Yet in a system- atic review of DBS literature, we found zero studies that reported condence intervals around estimates from a standard curve (for details on the systematic review, see Appendix 5). Neglect- ing uncertainty could give the false impression that the plasma-equivalent concentrations in are precisely known, and may increase Type 1and Type 2error in subsequent analyses. The use of a study-wide standard curve is also problematic in light of the measurement error described above. If a single conversion equation is used across all samples, the implicit assump- 27Figure 4: A typical standard curve and its application The standard curve relates optical density values (observed measures) to plasma equivalent values (biologically- relevant measures) using samples for which both are known. An example of a sample with optical density of 1.25is shown. tion is that all measurement error occurs at the individual sample level. In other words, the traditional standard curve ignores plate-level and study-level measurement error. This assump- tion can lead to erroneous results and conclusions when measuring antibody concentrations, determining serostatus of individuals, or estimating seroprevalence in a population. Very few serological studies and, to our knowledge, no DBS studies acknowledge uncertainty in the standard curve (Appendix 5). Fewer still take note of multi-level measurement error.11In this study, we argue that all DBS studies should at least report plasma-equivalent estimates with uncertainty intervals. We go on to present an algorithm to convert from OD measurements to plasma-equivalent concentrations while simultaneously standardizing measurement error at the assay plate level. We demonstrate the algorithm using immunization data from a multi-country serological study in Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia. 2.2 methods 2.2.1Data DBS data were collected as part of a prospective, multi-country evaluation of immunization activities called the Gavi Full Country Evaluations study. During a nationally representative household survey, children under age ve were randomly selected to participate in the DBS study. 2,117DBS samples were collected in Mozambique, 1,138DBS samples were collected in Uganda and 990 samples were collected in Zambia. Study enumerators were equipped with portable lancet devices, and absorbed ve droplets of blood from consenting participants onto Whatman 903lter paper cards. Filter paper cards were dried in open air, photographed and stored in sealed containers before being shipped to the processing laboratory (separate labora- tories for each country). 28A standard protocol was used to analyze concentrations of four analytes: hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and tetanus Immunoglobin G (tetanus IgG). Six 3.2mm discs were punched from each DBS card into 96-well microtiter plates and assays were performed using Diasorin ELISA kits in accordance with manufacturer instructions. The entire assay protocol included 19steps over two days and is detailed elsewhere.14 A number of validation and quality control samples were used as well. Each assay plate included negative and positive controls, blank controls and assay calibrator samples provided by the ELISA manufacturer. In addition, DBS controls were created in the laboratory using whole blood with high, low, and zero antibody concentration. Identical replicates of these DBS controls were used on every assay plate. On assay plates separate from the eld sample assays, a population of validation samples was analyzed which entailed serial dilution of plasma with known antibody concentrations. 2.2.2Traditional Standard Curve Formulation To demonstrate typical results and uncertainty intervals in OD-to-plasma conversion, we formu- lated a \"traditional\" standard curve (ignoring multi-level measurement error for the moment). OD was measured for DBS control samples with previously-determined plasma concentrations (samples i in the validation set v). Ordinary linear regression was then used to t a standard curve using the known plasma concentration as the dependent variable and log-OD as the independent variable, according to the following formula: plasmai2v= 0+ 1log(OD)i2v (1) The standard curve was used to determine the equivalent plasma concentration for each eld sample by evaluating equation 1with OD values from the eld samples. Uncertainty around the estimated plasma-equivalent concentrations was determined using the standard 95% condence interval from ordinary least squares. 2.2.3Standardization Algorithm To estimate a standard curve with added variation for each assay plate, we used random effects. Using DBS controls and the validation population (the two standards for which plasma concen- tration and OD are both known), the model was t with plasma concentration dependent on OD value, with plate-level slope and intercept follows: plasmai2vp= 0+ 1log(OD)i2vp+\u00150p+\u00151pODi2vp plasma concentrations and observed OD val- ues for individual sample i, measured on plate p(in the validation set v). The random intercepts (\u00150p) measure the vertical offset of each plate visible in Figure 1, and the random slopes ( \u00151p) 29measure how spread out or condensed each plate's controls are. In short, equation 2can be interpreted as a way to tting separate standard curves for each plate while making use of all of the data. Using the coefcients from equation 2, we estimated plasma-equivalent values for eld sam- ples (j), correcting for plate-level measurement error. This was accomplished by estimating the tted values from equation 2(dplasmajp), and then dividing and subtracting off the difference between each plate's random effects and the random effects of the represent estimated plasma-equivalent values whose location ( \u00150p) and scale (\u00151p) match that of the validation population, thereby removing plate-level differences. Uncertainty in the corrected plasma-equivalent estimates ( dplasmajp0) was captured through Monte Carlo simulation and cross validation. 1,000 random variants of dplasmajp0were esti- mated by drawing 1,000variants of each model coefcient from a multivariate normal distribu- tion. In order to incorporate data uncertainty in addition to model uncertainty, the model was evaluated out-of-sample using 100 randomly-sampled 2/3's training datasets. The root mean squared error of the predictions among the test datasets was used to add random error to the 1,000 variants of tted values prior to plate-level standardization. The upper and lower 2.5th percentiles of 1,000variants were used as its 95% uncertainty interval. The model formulation in equation 2was tested against alternative models such as log-linear and intercept-only models. Cross validation was used to assess the predictive validity of can- didate models for each analyte (HBsAb, HBcAb, and in some cases, log-transformed OD and intercept-only models were used instead. All analyses were performed using R version 3.1.2. The code that performs the conversion and standardization has been made publicly available at the following URL: https://github.com/ihmeuw/dbs 2.2.4Seroprevalence Each estimate of plasma-equivalent concentration (from both the \"traditional\" approach and standardization algorithm) was dichotomized according to a set threshold, above which sam- ples were deemed positive. The threshold for each analyte was determined either according to clinically-relevant limits or the ELISA manufacturer's instructions. We used a threshold of 5 mIU/ml to determine HBsAb serostatus, the calibration liquid included in the ELISA kit for HB- cAb, 1mIU/ml for HBsAg and 0.25mIU/ml for tetanus IgG.15-17Seroprevalence was dened as the proportion of samples which were positive. Sensitivity and specicity were estimated by comparing the known status of the control sam- ples to the predicted status based on the two conversion techniques. 302.3 results 2.3.1Plasma-Equivalent Estimates using \"Traditional\" Standard Curve Optical density values, equivalent plasma concentration estimates and uncertainty intervals are shown in Table 3by country and analyte. Taking HBsAb for example, the mean plasma- equivalent concentration was 10.2mIU/ml for Uganda and 13.7mIU/ml for Zambia (HB ana- lytes from Mozambique were not available). Plasma-equivalent estimates varied from sample to sample, with a standard deviation of 8.27mIU/ml for Uganda and 16.71mIU/ml for Zambia. Table 3also demonstrates the reporting of uncertainty. Each sample's plasma concentration was estimated with its own uncertainty interval (standard error), the mean of which is shown in column 5. Table 3: Descriptive statistics of optical density, unstandardized and standardized plasma-equivalent val- ues across all analytes/countries Country Analyte Optical Density Mean (SD)Unstandardized Plasma Concentration Mean (SD)Mean Standard ErrorStandardized Plasma Concentration Mean Standard 2 .31(5.16) 0.36 Regardless of whether the standardization algorithm is used, each plasma-equivalent value can be estimated with uncertainty. The Mean Standard Error columns in this table display the average width of that uncertainty interval across all samples. Seroprevalence estimates are displayed in Table 4. Dichotomizing the unstandardized plasma- equivalent values leads to HBsAb estimates of 69.7% in Uganda and 55.2% in Zambia. Osten- sibly, this would seem to indicate that Uganda has higher immunity. When considering uncer- tainty however, a more complete picture becomes apparent, as seroprevalence could be as low as53.0% or as high as 86.8% in Uganda and ranged from 45.9% to 65.6% in Zambia. Between-plate variance was found to vary by study location. Figure 5displays plasma-equivalent concentrations (estimated using the \"traditional\" standard curve) for HBsAb from the Zambia study, including eld samples and control samples. When displayed in this way, a moderate amount of between-plate variation can be noted. Figure 6shows plasma-equivalent concentra- tions for HBsAb from the Uganda study, demonstrating the relatively inordinate amount of plate-level and individual-level variability that was observed in that analyte and study. Using the mean absolute z-score across plates as a measure of between-plate variability, this was 0.30 31Table 4: Estimates of seroprevalence using \"traditional\" standard for HBsAb in Uganda, meaning that the typical plate was nearly one-third of a standard deviation higher or lower than the average. HBsAb samples from Zamia were found to have lower, but still notable, variation between plates, where the mean absolute z-score across plates was 0.17(minimum: 0.06, maximum: 0.49) respectively. using Standardization Algorithm The proposed algorithm reduces between-plate variation, as shown in Figure 7. The mean ab- solute z-score across plates was lower for all country-analytes, indicating smaller plate-level deviations from the average plate. These were 0.13(minimum: maximum: samples. Standardized plasma-equivalent concentrations and seroprevalence estimates were sometimes substantially different than unstandardized estimates (as Table 3and Table 4show), demonstrat- ing the effect that plate-level measurement error can have on results. Seroprevalence of HBsAb in Uganda was overestimated compared to standardized estimates, reducing from 69.7(95% uncertainty interval: 53.0-86.8) to49.0(95% uncertainty interval: 38.7-59.8) after standardization. Seroprevalence of certain other analytes was virtually unchanged by standardization however, such as HBsAb in Zambia, indicating low plate-level measurement error in that case. Sensitivity and specicity improved or remained the same across all analytes (Table 5). In some instances such as specicity of HBsAb and HBsAg, the improvement was dramatic, uncertainty 0.45-1.00) respectively. An important additional application for this algorithm is demonstrated in Figures 8and 9, that is the enhanced comparability between separate studies. In Figure 8, the HBsAb DBS samples from both Uganda and Zambia have been plotted side-by-side, making apparent the differences not only between plates in each study site, but between whole studies. Using the same validation population for both sites, the exact same algorithm is able standardize the two 32Figure 5: Plasma-equivalent concentrations for Zambia HBsAb using the \"traditional\" standard curve (without standardization) In the above gure, each column of points represents a separate ELISA plate.

Uncertainty measured in the conversion and standardization process is displayed in Figure 10. For each sample's OD, the corresponding plasma concentration could fall within a range of values, averaging +/- 8.66% mIU/ml for HBsAb in Zambia. capture the plate-level and individual-level variability, exhibiting much wider intervals for HBsAb in Uganda, where both sources of variance were noticeably higher. 2.4 discussion The approach described above converts OD values to their equivalent plasma concentrations and simultaneously standardizes plate-level and study-level measurement error with uncertainty. The algorithm improved sensitivity and specicity in all studies and analytes. Compared with traditional approaches that estimate plasma-equivalent values without stan- dardization, our algorithm has a distinct advantages. First, plasma concentrations are often dichotomized with a simple threshold, above which study participants are considered to be positive (i.e. carriers of sufcient antibodies for immunity). If the same threshold is applied across all plates, plate-level measurement error will result in many false positives and false neg- atives, as shown in Table 5. Secondly, the enhanced comparability between studies (Figures 8 and9) is very benecial to for Uganda HBsAb using the \"traditional\" standard curve (without standardization) In the above gure, each column of points represents a separate ELISA plate. Points represent plasma concentration values for individuals. Blue circles identify eld samples, triangles identify the \"validation\" samples (i.e. assays using plasma with known antibody concentration), and the red, orange and green circles represent \"DBS control\" samples (i.e. DBS using whole blood with known antibody concentration). ization, biases inherent to the differences between studies could render cross-study comparisons altogether unreliable. This approach is based on a few key assumptions. A fundamental principle is that the vali- dation plate can be held as the gold standard to which the eld samples should be corrected. Biased validation samples will naturally induce mirrored bias in the standardized eld samples. A second key principle is that the sources of plate-level measurement error, whatever they may be, apply to the DBS controls and eld samples similarly. In this study, we found that the DBS controls were higher on plates with generally higher eld samples and vice versa, indicating that they did experience similar plate-level measurement error to the eld samples. The DBS control samples correlated strongly with the eld samples on the same plate, for example the low positive control for HBsAb in Uganda had a correlation coefcient of 0.74with the mean eld samples on the sample plate. Finally, the model is based on the assumption that plate-level measurement error is stochastic in nature and normally distributed. From an alternative perspective, it may seem unnecessary to standardize measurement error at all; one could argue that more tightly-controlled DBS studies would prevent measurement error in the rst place. Our philosophy is that every serological study, no matter how carefully conducted, is subject to some degree of measurement error that is outside the control of those involved. This is especially true in resource-limited settings (such as this study), where physical and logistical constraints are often irrepressible. While it is of course worthwhile to minimize measurement error, we believe that application of this technique can enhance the utility and accuracy of even the most carefully-controlled studies. 34Figure 7: Plasma-equivalent concentrations for Uganda HBsAb using the standardization algorithm The standardization algorithm uses DBS controls to adjust the level and spread of the eld samples to match the validation samples. Two common practices can be seen as alternative approaches to addressing uncertainty and measurement error. First, the reporting of an \"equivocal\" serostatus category, representing sam- ples that fall very near the threshold, is nearly universal. This is a useful practice in the sense that it mitigates false positives and negatives by essentially considering borderline cases as \"nei- ther\". We suggest however that an uncertainty interval around the categorization of serostatus accomplishes the same effect, but is more precise since it allows (with proper interpretation) the analyst to report the probability that a particular sample is positive or negative, rather than just reporting one of three discrete categories. The second common practice in addressing mea- surement error is to simply discard errant samples or plates. This approach can certainly be sensible, as some assays may be too egregious to be useful, or uncorrectable based on their validation samples. One example is assay plates 1and2from Zambia HBsAb (Figures 8and9). Because essentially no correlation was found between the control samples and the eld samples, the algorithm failed to standardize the plasma-equivalent estimates. We believe our proposed algorithm offers a defensible approach to even the most extreme cases however, because they will simply be reflected in a wider uncertainty interval. The lack of reporting on uncertainty, plate-level or any higher-level measurement error in other serological studies is alarming. Given the potential for biased results, we emphasize the importance of examining, reporting and correcting measurement error. For comparisons be- tween studies or between laboratories of the same study (as was the case in here), reliance on a common validation population is critical to ensure the same standardization for all sites. To utilize this approach, it is necessary that assays include control samples that are comparable to the eld samples on every plate. One lesson learned from this study is that control samples should be assayed in triplicate or more to ensure that the random effects coefcients are robust to sample-level error. Without proper controls at all however, standardization of measurement 35Table 5: Sensitivity and specicity among control samples Optical density values for Uganda and Zambia together using the \"traditional\" standard curve (HBsAb) error is impossible. At the very least, plasma estimates should always be produced and reported with uncertainty intervals. This study presents a simple, publicly-available algorithm that corrects for important sources of measurement error while simultaneously estimating plasma antibody concentrations from DBS data. The technique could easily be expanded to other serological studies beyond vaccine effectiveness evaluation with DBS, and even applied to correct for other sources of measurement error, such as enumerator biases or other laboratory biases. The application of this technique could enhance the accuracy and utility of future studies, and enable more precise, reliable estimates of health outcomes such as disease prevalence, vaccine effectiveness and health impact. 36Figure 9: Plasma-equivalent concentrations for Uganda and Zambia together using the standardization algorithm (HBsAb) Figure 10: Plasma-equivalent concentrations for Zambia HBsAb, including uncertainty intervals ( 20% sample of all data) 372.5 references 1.

Barriers to effective coverage are complex and difcult to measure though. A recent system- atic review (Chapter 1) shows the large number of determinants and complex structure relating them.11Many determinants are associated with effective coverage, but their effects are medi- ated and confounded by others. Determinants also vary between different outcomes.7-9The set of barriers to initial engagement with the health system may be different than barriers to com- pleting the dosage schedule, and new vaccines present further challenges.13Determinants of immunity (conditional on vaccination) are different altogether.14Direct measurement of immu- nity is difcult too. It requires serological data4which has been shown (Chapter 2) to include its own uncertainty.12 Hundreds of research studies have sought to measure determinants and barriers in LMICs.11,15-18 Most studies face key limitations however. First, the theoretical model for analysis is often infor- mally dened. Issues such as the universe of determinants and the structure to their relationship are rarely explicitly stated. Second, studies typically use only household survey data. These data suitably reflect maternal perceptions, and characteristics, but not community and health system factors. Third, most studies use generalized linear models to estimate odds ratios. These models have limited ability to realistically depict an underpinning theoretical model, including medi- ation and indirectly measurable latent constructs.19These limitations can be summarized as theory, confounding, directionality and construct validity. The objective of this study is to measure determinants using a more integrated approach. This includes a clearly-dened hypothetical model. It also includes multi-faceted data and a model- ing strategy that both realistically represents the hypothetical model and makes full use of the data. We use a conceptual framework from a recent systematic review and qualitative analysis (Chapter 1) to dene the hypothetical model.11The data are four linked surveys from a prospec- tive evaluation in Uganda and Zambia.20These measure child immunization using serologically- measured immunity and link child-level information to health facility information.12We employ Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling (BSEM) with latent variables to represent the hypothet- ical model using the data.19,21Special emphasis is placed on displaying the results in a manner which is useful to policy-makers, so that the original challenge of identifying key barriers to effective coverage can be met. 403.2 methods The original framework of effective coverage denes it as the combination of utilization and effectiveness.2We carried out separate analyses for vaccine utilization (coverage) and immuniza- tion (effective coverage). The coverage analysis used BSEM, and the effective coverage analysis used logistic regression. Four outcomes were analyzed, chosen to reflect differences between new and routine vaccines, initiation and drop-out, and vaccines for which antibody-measured immunity was assessed (hepatitis B and tetanus). We demonstrate the results by examining regression coefcients, comparing explained variance, and using counterfactual analysis. 3.2.1Data The data come from four linked surveys conducted as part of the Gavi Full-Country Evaluation study20in Uganda and Zambia: 1. Household survey (HHS) 2. Health facility survey (HFS) 3. District health ofce (DHO) survey 4. Patient exit survey (PES) Sampling design was a stratied, two-stage, clustered random sample described in detail elsewhere.20Data collection concluded with a sample size of 4,256 households, 177 facilities and2,202patient interviews in 19districts in Uganda, and 1,070households, 171facilities and 3,319patient interviews in 21districts in Zambia. Further details can be found in Appendix 6.2. Household survey instruments included maternal, child and household characteristics, vacci- nation and pregnancy history, knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of vaccines and local vac- cine services and others. Health facility and DHO instruments included facility characteristics, resources, supply chain records and others. Patient variables included maternal characteristics, services received, costs and others. A careful data processing procedure was followed, described in Appendix 6.2. A number of outcome variables were examined. In the coverage analysis, receipt of at least 1 dose of the pentavalent vaccine (Pentavalent- 1),3doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 3) were analyzed separately for both countries. Coverage was determined based on the child's vaccine card whenever available, and maternal recall if necessary. For determinants of effective coverage, immune status for hepatitis B and tetanus were analyzed among vaccinated children. Immune status was determined based on plasma antibody concentrations above a clinically-relevance threshold, measured by a serological data collection technique known as dried blood spots (DBS).12 Eligible children for the analyses were any child older than 3months, excluding children who were older than 18months and born before introduction of PCV (for PCV analyses only), and excluding children whose caretaker was not their biological mother. 413.2.2Coverage Analysis For vaccine coverage, we used Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling (BSEM) with latent variables19,21-23to represent a hypothesized model11using the survey data. Details on the model- ing approach are in Appendix 6.3. Briefly, SEM is a method for estimating simultaneous regres- sion equations, relying on a \"structural model\" (theory) and measurement models (data).19,23La- tent variable analysis uses systems of equations to represent variables that can only be indirectly measured.19,23Bayesian approaches to SEM have more recently been developed to incorporate prior information about parameters and estimate posterior distributions.21 3.2.2.1Structural Model The structural model in the coverage analysis is depicted in Figure 1. This model ties together constructs from existing theories24,25and was developed using systematic review and qualitative methods (Chapter 1).11The framework hypothesizes three principal determinants of vaccine utilization: \u000fIntent to Vaccinate - Demand for vaccines on the part of the mother that would result in vaccination in the absence of other barriers. \u000fFacility Readiness - Supply (by the health system) of vaccine services to adequately meet demand. Incorporates supplies (vials, syringes etc.), human resources and the consistency of their availability. \u000fCommunity Access - The ability (or inability) to successfully carry out the transaction of vaccine utilization, i.e. barriers and facilitators between Intent and Readiness. The rationale, evidence base and methodology behind this hypothesized model are described in detail elsewhere (Chapter 1).11These three determinants are represented in the BSEM as latent variables, or constructs which are indirectly measured with the data. As shown in Figure 1, Intent to Vaccinate and Facility Readiness are themselves informed by other latent variables. 3.2.2.2Measurement Model The measurement model, i.e. specication of data to dene latent variables, was also based on systematic review.11Survey instruments were screened for variables which matched or approxi- mated indicators from systematic review. Candidate variables were visualized a priori to ensure adequate variance in responses and to avoid issues with complete separation. Final variable selection was as inclusive as possible. All viable data which, according to existing evidence, represented at least one latent variable were included. For more detail on the variables included in the model, see Appendix 6.3.3. Table 6describes the data used in the coverage analysis. Appendix Figure 17displays his- tograms observed variables as well as the odds ratio associating each variable with Pentavalent- 1 coverage. In all, 36observed variables were used to represent the 8latent variables. A combi- nation of formative, reflective and composite latent variables were used as well as covariance terms for correlated errors.19,23For more detail on latent variables, see Appendix 6.3.1. 42Figure 11: Structural model of latent variables 43Table 6: Model variables and descriptions Variable Description Unit of Analysis Child Age Child's age Child Pentavalent- 3Coverage Either card or recall - Pentavalent 3received Child Vehicles Total 3or4wheel vehicles Facility Distance Distance from household to facility (mean) Household Outreach Frequency (Com.)

(16) 3.2.2.3Prior Distributions Prior distributions were selected for all coefcients, intercepts and variance terms. To allow the data to influence posterior distributions, diffuse priors were used for all parameters. For the same reason, all priors in the same family and expected direction were set equal (i.e. prior dis- tributions did not influence the relative magnitude of comparable coefcients). For coefcients relating data to latent variables (formulae 6-8and11-16), normal prior distributions with low precision ( =0.01) were used. Each coefcient was given a prior mean of - 1,0or1, depending on the expected direction of that coefcient in the literature. Pathways in the structural model (Figure 1and formulae 5,9and10) were hypothesized to be strictly positive. That being the case, identical gamma priors were used with a shape and scale parameters equal to 1. Residual variances and covariances were modeled with gamma( 1,0.5) priors. A sensitivity analysis with different priors is shown in Appendix 6.4. Evaluative techniques included goodness of t statistics and predictive validity. Posterior probabilities of vaccination were computed from the model, and sensitivity, specicity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and concordance were evaluated at different thresholds to assess how well the model classied children's vaccine statuses. Further detail on performance metrics is described in Appendix 6.4.2 Effective Coverage Analysis Drivers of effective coverage, i.e. immunization, were assessed using a more straightforward modeling approach. Because determinants of immunity alone are 46considerably more direct than determinants of coverage, we used logistic regression to measure coefcients. The outcome variable for this analysis was immunity conditional on vaccination. Immunity was measured by DBS, and both hepatitis B and tetanus immunization were examined. Ten explanatory variables were used in this analysis, and were selected based on systematic review of the causes of vaccine failure.11These included the child's age at rst dose, inter- val between rst and second dose, interval between second and third dose, storage temperature measured at the health facility, storage temperature measured at the district health ofce (DHO), distance from DHO to health facility, whether the child was vaccinated during outreach, dura- tion of breastfeeding and controls for year and season. Immune status is subject to uncertainty as well, since it is derived from imperfectly-measured antibody concentrations.12Uncertainty of immune status was propagated into this model using Monte Carlo simulation.

For example, the number of vehicles owned by a facility (shown in the upper-right of Figure 2) has a modest correlation with the Supply construct (mid- 48Figure 12: Full model of vaccine constraints and determinants (Pentavalent- 3, Uganda) point estimate: 0.06, highest posterior density interval (HPD): 0.03-0.09). This was found to be a weaker correlation than \"Push Delivery\" (a binary indicator of whether vaccine supplies are sent to the facility or retrieved by a facility staff member); the estimated coefcient of that variable was0.26(HPD: 0.20-0.32). As another example, stated perceptions, such as perceived symptoms prevented by vaccines, were more strongly reflective of positive Attitudes toward vaccines than behaviors such as reliance on a traditional birth attendant (TBA). The estimated coefcient of the former variable was 1.47(HPD: 1.21-1.72), while the latter was - 0.01(HPD: - 0.02-0.01). Regarding uncertainty, some coefcients such as the coefcient connecting DHO distance and Supply had a relatively narrow credible interval (mid-point: - 0.05, HPD: - 0.03-0.06). Others, such as the coefcient connecting outreach frequency and Perceived Norms are very uncertain (mid- point: 0.77, HPD: - 18.8-20.4). Comparing the full model from Uganda to Zambia (Appendix Figure 19and Appendix Table 9), credible intervals in the Zambian estimates were on average 3.5times wider (standard deviation 5.4), due to smaller sample size. Other important model parameters such as error terms and covariances are displayed in Appendix Tables 10(Uganda) and10(Zambia). Figure 3displays a summary of all eight models, highlighting basic determinants of vaccine coverage according to the models and data. In these pie charts, the size of each slice represents the proportion of vaccine coverage which is explained by each of the most proximal variables. Slices are also broken down into their contributing factors. Taking Pentavalent- 3in Uganda (the second pie chart) as an example, the largest proportion of variance ( 36.3%) in vaccine coverage can be explained by the mother's Intent to Vaccinate (Attitudes and Perceptions). The next largest explanatory factor is Health Facility Readiness which explains 24.6% of vaccine 49coverage. Community Access to vaccine services explains a further 20.9% of vaccine coverage, and a remaining 18.2% is left unexplained by the model and data. Figure 13: Primary and secondary determinants of vaccine coverage Comparing Pentavalent- 1to Pentavalent- 3, Intent to Vaccinate explains of that difference indicates that Intent is a key driver of completion of the dosage schedule, but less so for initiation. Access on the other hand represents a larger proportion of the explain- able variance in Pentavalent- 1. Among the three primary determinants (Access, Readiness and Intent), Access represents about one third of the explained variance ( 33.8%, 3.2%-78.2%) for Pentavalent- 3. These results are less conclusive however, since an even larger proportion of variance in Pentavalent- 1is unexplained by the model. Comparing pentavalent to PCV 1, Facility Readiness explains a larger indicates that Facility Readiness is a key barrier to new vaccines, more so than routine vaccines. The differences between PCV 1and PCV 3also highlight the impor- tance of of drop-out; Intent and Zambian datasets, many similarities and some differences can be noted. For Pentavalent- 1, the proportions are similar, though Facility Readiness explains more variance in Zambia 3, the reverse is true; the proportions are again similar, but Facility Readiness ex- plains less variance in Pentavalent- 3coverage opposite of the patterns seen in the Ugandan data. Both are larger than the estimates from pentavalent however, again indicating that Facility Readiness represents a key barrier to new vaccines. Similar to Uganda, Intent to Vaccinate explains more 1(25.0%, the role of Intent in drop-out. Exploring the results deeper, Figure 13also shows that some upstream factors explain more variance than others. Facility Readiness, for example, is often more influenced by Workforce (staff, efciency etc.) in the Ugandan data, and vaccine Supply (stockouts, deliveries etc.) in the Zambian data. Perceived Norms about vaccinations explain a greater proportion of Intent to Vaccinate than either Attitudes toward vaccinations or Perceived Control (self-efcacy) in most models. Community Access was more evenly split among its contributing factors, with cost, distance to facility, household wealth and parity all explaining substantial portions of Community Access in most models. Figure 14illustrates the results using counterfactual analysis. In this gure, the expected level of vaccine coverage is estimated under the counterfactual scenario that a particular constraint has been fully removed. In other words, the bars in Figure 14indicate what vaccine coverage would be (predicted by the model) if the corresponding variable was held uniformly at its max- imum or minimum level. For instance, cost was found to be the largest constraint. If every child in the analysis had a total vaccination cost equivalent to the lowest observed cost, predicted vac- cine coverage would be an estimated 81.5% (95% prediction interval 59.5% -94.6%). This can be compared to the \"benchmark coverage\", i.e. the actual vaccine coverage predicted by the model, which was 48.6%. Some large constraints, such as having a previous failed attempt at vaccina- tion, were found to be associated with high counterfactual coverage but are qualitatively less interesting because they aren't readily modiable. Other constraints, such as the total catchment population ( 77.6% simulated coverage, 95% prediction interval 57.6% -95.1%), staff (65.2% simulated coverage, prediction interval: 40.1%-88.1% ) and frequency of ordering sup- plies, measured as the median days between orders, ( 62.0% simulated coverage, 95% prediction interval 39.2% -85.5%) were also found to be large constraints to vaccination in the data. These counterfactual results provide a commonsense interpretation of the coefcients in their totality (including mediation), but are not intended to imply causality (see discussion). Model performance, assessed by numerous separate approaches, was adequate. For Pentavalent- 3in Uganda, model coefcients were aligned with expectations based on the literature in 46out of56coefcients (among coefcients with an expected direction). For example, parity, distance and cost, constraints which one would expect to be barriers to Access, all had negative coef- cients while wealth had a positive coefcient. Some, such as travel time and previous difculty were opposite of expectations; these were be expected to be barriers to Perceived Control, but had positive coefcients. See Appendix 6.4for details. Goodness-of-t statistics also show fa- vorable model performance. R2, the proportion of variance in vaccine status explained by the model, ranged from 87.8% for PCV 3in Zambia, to 45.0% for Pentavalent- 1in Uganda. In-sample predictive validity, shown in Figure 16, was high. Using the predicted probability of vaccination, performance metrics were computed at various thresholds to assess how well the model clas- sied children's vaccine statuses. Predicted vaccine status agreed with observed vaccine status for90% of cases, with sensitivity of 0.88, specicity of 0.93, of 0.97and NPV best threshold. 3.3.2Effective Coverage Analysis Figure 16shows the results of the effective coverage analysis, displaying odds of immunity to hepatitis B in Uganda. Considerable uncertainty was found with regard to determinants of ef- 51Figure 14: Counterfactual analysis: simulated coverage with selected constraints removed (PCV 3) fective coverage. Year of vaccination was positively correlated immunity (odds ratio: 1.14, 95% condence interval: 1.00-1.31, p-value: 0.05), indicating effective coverage has increased over time, adjusting for confounding. Children vaccinated during outreach activities had very low odds of gaining immunity (odds ratio 0.42,95% condence interval 0.15-1.02, p-value: 0.06), which indicates that children vaccinated through routine vaccine services were more likely to be effectively immunized than those vaccinated during community outreach. All other determi- nants were weakly correlated with immunity. For example, children vaccinated at the appropri- ate age had higher odds of immunity (odds ratio: 1.44), but this correlation was uncertain ( 95% condence interval: 0.87-2.41, p-value: 0.15). Some determinants had correlation with immunity that was opposite than expected. For example children who were vaccinated with an appropri- ate interval between the rst and second dose ( 28days) had lower odds of immunity (odds ratio: 0.84), though the correlation was again uncertain ( 95% condence interval: 0.44-1.60, p-value: 0.59). Similarly uncertain results were found in the Zambian data. Year of vaccination was again positively correlated with immunity, with an odds ratio of 1.47(95% condence interval: 0.99- 2.20, p-value: 0.06). Outreach with immunity as well (odds ratio: 0.81), but the was less certain ( 95% condence interval: 0.40-1.69, p-value: 0.56) than in Uganda. Similar results were also found for immunity to tetanus instead of hepatitis B. 52Figure 15: Coverage analysis model performance (Pentavalent- 3, Uganda) 3.4 discussion This analysis highlights the importance of considering determinants in the context of a particu- lar outcome. In other words, there is a set of constraints to the rst dose of a vaccine, a largely different set of constraints to completing the full regimen, and still others for new vaccines. To summarize the ndings coarsely, access-related barriers contribute most strongly to initiation, demand-related determinants contribute most strongly to completion, and supply-side determi- nants contribute most strongly to new vaccines. The implication is that public health programs in Uganda and Zambia can be more targeted in their efforts, depending on the outcome they are trying to achieve. For example, the results show that the largest proportion of PCV 1and PCV 3 coverage can be explained by Facility Readiness. New vaccine introduction programs should focus more heavily (though not entirely) on contributors to Readiness, like Supply and Work- force. Another implication is that programs focusing on reducing barriers can identify a metric of success that is most suitable for their target constraint. For example, the results show that a larger proportion of the third dose of each vaccine was explained by demand (Intent). Demand generation activities should use changes in drop-out as their metric of success. Specic variables stand out as stronger correlates than others, shown in the counterfactual analysis and effective coverage analysis. Because of the complex mediation in the coverage model, the strength of the relationship between any particular variable and vaccine coverage can be obscured. The counterfactual analysis shows that, incorporating all mediating effects, certain variables like cost and health facility staff would be expected to have a large impact on vaccine coverage if improved. This has implications for policy-makers looking for effective ways to improve vaccine coverage in these countries; they should focus reducing total cost and supporting facility staff more than the other indicators in Figure 14. Other counterfactual results offer further insights. For example, facilities served by a \"push delivery\" system have a strong positive correlation with Supply (mentioned in the Results section). Despite this, the model predicts only a modest improvement in vaccine coverage if all facilities switched to a \"push\" system. This has two implications: 1) that the effects of mediation are important to consider for all vaccine determinants, and 2) other aspects of the health systems in Uganda and Zambia may be more effective targets for intervention by policy-makers. A separate observation is the relatively high unexplained variance in Pentavalent- 1for both countries. This most likely indicates that some important determinants and barriers have been neglected. One challenge in identifying the source is that this unexplained variance is not ap- 53Figure 16: Determinants of effective coverage: immunity to hepatitis B among vaccinated children in Uganda parent in Pentavalent- 3or PCV . Some speculation on the neglected determinants may be useful, but if oversights in the model were clearly apparent, they would have been included in the rst place. Perhaps the strongest argument is that Access has not been measured completely enough in this model. The results show that Access is a stronger determinant of initiation than other outcomes, but this model only measures it with the four most empirically-supported variables. Other inputs to Access, such as occupation and marital status may add further explanatory power, but were not included in the data. In the case of the effective coverage analysis, most of the variation in immunity was not captured by the variables used here. Among the substantive ndings, immunity appears to be increasing with time, and lower odds of immunity are associated with outreach vaccination. This may indicate that practices common in community outreach put vaccines at risk of failure. We recommend a focused study on outreach activities. Other variables, such as vaccine storage temperatures and the interval between doses were surprisingly uncorrelated with immunity. This may indicate that these determinants are weak drivers of vaccine effectiveness, or that they were sufciently well-managed in these settings to register no correlation. Alternatively, uncontrolled confounding or systematic measurement error may have led to the null results. However, the set of determinants was informed by a large systematic review (Chapter 1)11, and novel techniques were used to correct biases in the DBS data (Chapter 2)12. More research appears to be necessary to learn the full range of effectiveness determinants. In comparison with previous research, this study represents a number of important advances. By using data from both the supply-side and demand-side, this analysis controls for confound- ing to an extent that few previous studies have.4,11Our methodological approach is an improve- ment on traditional approaches. By relying on systems of equations, this analysis is explicit about directionality. By integrating latent variables, this analysis improves construct validity and represents the hypothesized model more closely. Perhaps most importantly, the model in this analysis is based on a rigorous, evidence-based conceptual framework. 54Some of these advantages can be demonstrated by reproducing other studies. We identi- ed one study, Bbaale 2013 , which quantitatively analyzed determinants of routine childhood vaccination coverage in Uganda.26This study used multivariate probit regression with nine ex- planatory variables and complete dosage of BCG, DPT, polio and measles vaccines as separate outcomes. Using Gavi FCE data, we replicated this analysis. Although both models describe the data fairly well, our model outperformed Bbaale 2013 , correctly classifying the vaccine status of 90% of children as compared with 68%. We identied one study that used SEM to directly com- pare behavior change theories for HPV vaccination in the United States.27The leading model in that study (also based on the Theory of Planned Behavior) was only able to explain 39% of variance in vaccine coverage, as compared to our models which ranged from 45.0% to 87.8%. Despite certain methodological advantages, these analyses have limitations. One key limita- tion of the coverage analysis is model selection.28The structural and measurement models we have chosen may not be the most accurate reflection of reality. We have carried out some sen- sitivity analyses test robustness to alternative measurement models (see Appendix 6.4). These generally conclude that the variables selected for inclusion enhance the model's explanatory ability without exerting outsized influence on the substance of the results. Sensitivity analy- sis of this kind is less feasible for testing the structural model, given its qualitative formulation. However, is grounded in a larger body of existing evidence than any comparable analysis to our knowledge.11We encourage future studies to develop alternative hypothetical models using the same systematic review, and to test the model presented here using new data. Further limitations may be related to the data used for the analysis. First, the cross-sectional nature of these data limits our ability to assess dynamic temporal effects. This is simply a limi- tation that could not be address in our analysis. Second, some parts of the coverage analysis are based on data that were not collected specically for that purpose. In some cases, the closest ap- proximation to the ideal data was used in the absence of anything else. An example of this is the Perceived Norms construct. This construct (like others from the Theory of Planed Behavior) is typically measured by designing a survey instrument specically to ask about norms.29Because our household survey was designed for a multitude of other purposes, such questions were not included. In their absence, it was necessary to identify new variables that are hypothesized to influence Perceived Norms. These included social networks, outreach frequency and commu- nity coverage (see Table 6and Appendix 6.3.3). A third data limitation is linkage of households to facilities. Households were sampled by design to be in the catchment areas of health facil- ities, but mothers may choose to vaccinate their children elsewhere. This may bias the results because mothers who choose alternative facilities may have certain characteristics in common. Attempts were made to identify the actual facility of vaccination, but proved to be intractably difcult due to unstandardized, often informal, health facility names in these countries. Instead, we consider this analysis akin to intent to treat analysis. Respondents were \"assigned\" to their nearest facility, but the reasons for non-compliance with that assignment were beyond our abil- ity to control. Fourth, vaccine status was based on the child's vaccine card where possible, but maternal recall when necessary. Recall was ultimately used in 37% of cases for pentavalent, and 21% for PCV . Further analysis on recall bias (see Appendix Figure 20) shows that recall is nega- tively correlated with dose number (i.e. mothers tended to underestimate the number of doses received when a vaccine card was also available). Further analysis has shown that ownership of a vaccine card is correlated with some explanatory variables. This is expected to bias estimates away from zero in cases where estimates and the correlation with card ownership are in the same direction. Finally, the sample size in the Zambian data is approximately a third of that in the Ugandan data, a fact which contributes to uncertainty. 55We caution against making inferences beyond what is reasonable given the model and data. Low values of a model coefcient may simply be an indication that the associated indicator has low variance in our sample (and low covariance with vaccine coverage). For example, we found that supply-side constraints are critical for new vaccines. This nding could imply one of two things: 1) that demand-side determinants are not major drivers of new vaccine coverage, or 2) that these two countries are already adequately addressing them. As such, these results are most useful in context of Uganda and Zambia rather than generalizing beyond. Also, our reliance on counterfactual analysis is for intuitive explanation of the results and not an attempt to interpret them causally. Although many criteria for causality are established in this analysis, temporality (noted above) is not. While we went to great lengths to ensure the most robust analysis possible, the model results should be interpreted as cross-sectional patterns within our data, and not as causal results. These patterns should be regarded as reliably-measured however, and future researchers should use them when planning studies that are specically designed to establish causality. This analysis represents a number of important accomplishments. First, it presents an inte- grated approach for measuring determinants of effective vaccine coverage that more realisti- cally represents real-world complexities than previous research. Second, it provides evidence that public health practitioners should approach determinants in the context of their most rel- evant outcomes. Third, it provides evidence (albeit cross-sectional) of the specic determinants that could have the greatest impact on vaccine coverage in these two populations, if targeted. Future studies should seek to improve upon the analytic framework we present here, to apply it in different settings, and to utilize stronger study designs. As vaccine programs around continue progress toward effective coverage, better measure- ment of determinants and barriers will be imperative to close remaining gaps and inequities. Programs like Gavi HSS support that focus on a particular determinant should use these results to select an outcome that is appropriate to measure their effectiveness. Most importantly, vacci- nation campaigns in these two countries should use our ndings to better target interventions and continue progress against vaccine preventable diseases. 563.5 references 1.

First, the members of my dissertation committee, Dr. Jessica Shearer, Dr. Cristian Baeza, Dr. Joseph Dieleman, Dr. Jon Wakeeld and especially Dr. Stephen Lim were instrumental to the project. Without the guidance, mentorship and friendship of this incredible group of researchers, this study would not be what it is. The community at the University of Washington's Department Global Health, and the Insti- tute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is truly unique. These supporting and innova- tive research communities have been formative to my education and ability as a global health researcher. I would especially like to thank the PhD program leadership, Drs. Emmanuela Gaki- dou and Kenneth Sherr for their support in the program. I also thank my early research men- tors at IHME, Drs. Christopher Murray, Rafael Lozano and Mohsen Naghavi for teaching me so much of what I know today. This research was part of a larger, multi-country evaluation at IHME, and I thank all those involved in its success. Finally, thanks to my wife, Dana, whose support and companionship I value the most. 614 A P P E N D I X A 4.1 literature search and data extraction [Referred to in section 1.2.1] This section provides additional detail about literature search and data extraction procedures as part of the systematic review. Included herein are details about preliminary review, structured literature search, article review and data extraction. This section also describes additional details of the content analysis: tabulation of extracted data. 4.1.1Literature Search 4.1.1.1Preliminary Review A preliminary review was rst conducted to inform future searches and analyses. This was carried out in an unstructured manner, iteratively relying on Google Scholar search results, backward/forward citation searches, examination of highly-cited articles and expert input. Ci- tation network diagrams were generated as an aid to locate works that web searches did not immediately uncover, but which other researchers often reference. The objectives of the preliminary review were: 1) to identify the central and seminal works in vaccine determinants, health service utilization and effective coverage research, 2) to document the language and terminology most commonly used in these areas in order to inform a more structured review, 3) to identify key relevant databases of literature, and 4) to dene a loose framework of themes as a starting point for analysis. 4.1.1.2Structured Literature Search A structured search of literature was subsequently conducted. The search strategy and proce- dure for identifying articles followed PRISMA guidelines.( 1) The objective of the search was to uncover all electronically-available documents regarding research on determinants of vaccine coverage or effectiveness. Eligibility criteria were established in advance, using information from the preliminary review as a guide. Table 8lists all criteria. Any English-language article that supplied evidence for at least one determinant of vaccine coverage or effectiveness was eligible for inclusion. Articles were excluded if they specically pertained to any of the following topics without meeting the inclusion criterion: adult vaccines besides HPV , animal vaccines, levels and trends of coverage, consequences of utilization, health impact, highly-specic subpopulations (e.g. travelers, HIV- positive populations), vaccine effectiveness/efcacy/safety, disease treatment, pathobiology, fu- ture vaccines, cost effectiveness, general health care utilization, impact of a single intervention, vaccine manufacturing, promotion of a particular vaccine technology. A set of 112potential search terms (mostly various synonyms) was developed based on the preliminary review, these terms are listed in Appendix 2. The search strategy was as follows: 621. Organize the potential searches according to their expected propensity to return unique and relevant results (conditional on previous searches) 2. Review the rst 500Google Scholar titles for each search term and add eligible citations to a database 3. Count the proportion of new and duplicate articles identied by the present search 4. Stop when the duplication percentage exceeds 33% for three consecutive searches 5. Conduct two PubMed searches with multiple MeSH terms and screen results in their entirety. By this procedure, fourteen Google Scholar and 2PubMed searches were conducted. In addition, nine special databases such as Cochrane Library, EPPI Centre and HealthSystemsEvidence.org were screened in their entirety with the keywords \"Vaccine\" and \"Immunization\".( 2-6) Nine existing systematic reviews were discovered through this process, and their compete citation lists were also screened.( 7-15) 4.1.2Data Extraction 4.1.2.1Article Review All discovered articles and documents were catalogued in a citation database and systematically evaluated for relevance to the present study's objectives. The objective of this stage was to organize the search results so that they could be analyzed in descending order of relevance. Articles and documents were assigned a subjective relevance score ( 0- irrelevant to the present study, 1- exactly on-topic) based on a set of ve criteria: 1) comprehensiveness of determinants covered, 2) emphasis (whether determinants were the main focus or only part of it),3) geography, 4) outcomes (e.g. vaccine coverage vs attitudes towards vaccination), 5) novelty (i.e. uniqueness among the rest of the body of literature). Relevance was determined using the title and abstract. 4.1.2.2Data Extraction Starting with the most relevant articles, the information therein was systematically extracted and stored in a database. The objectives of this stage were to nd a subset of articles large enough to perform content analysis, thematic analysis and interpretive synthesis (see subsequent sections), and to itemize and understand the content of that subset of articles. Fourteen variables were extracted from each study in the subset. Variables included study characteristics and content of study results. The study characteristics extracted were: 1) coun- try/region, 2) whether the study was a review, 3) study design, 4) study population and 5) related studies (i.e. other articles published using the same data). Content extracted was: 1) antigen(s), 2) outcome(s), 3) determinant(s), 4) whether the list of determinants was exhaustive (according to the authors), 5) proximity of each determinant to the outcome (as assessed by the authors), 6) pathways connecting each determinant to the outcome (as assessed by the authors), 7) effect size(s), 8) theme(s), and 9) thematic excerpts. A color-coding system was used, and all coded documents were stored digitally to ensure transparency and consistency between extrac- tions. Data were extracted from articles in descending order of relevance until a subjective level of saturation was reached, i.e. data from new articles ceased to contribute new information. 634.1.3Study Characteristics Content was extracted from 78articles. Among these, 51were from lower and middle-income countries, 10were from high-income countries, and 17were not specic to a geographic re- gion. Many studies could be classied as more than one study design. 21studies included systematic reviews, 2were randomized control trials, 36included observational quantitative data, 5included qualitative observational methods, 10included qualitative interviews, 10were discussion/commentaries and 3were none of the above. Studies often described determinants of vaccination for more than one vaccine antigen as well. In total, 15vaccine antigens (including \"fully vaccinated\") were analyzed among the 78studies, which on DTP and 6which included PCV .

The search was performed in 5major databases of peer-reviewed articles (For example, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and PubMed). In each database, two search strategies were performed. The rst search strategy used in each of the databases was to employ a structured keyword bank in order to focus the search. The second strategy in each database use text words (in the title and in the abstract) in order to capture articles not yet included in the sample. We focused on two major keywords: Dried Blood Spot and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay(ELISA). Additionally, we Surface Antigen(HBsAg), and Optical Density. We reviewed titles, abstracts, and full-length articles to identify potentially relevant articles. Only studies published in peer-reviewed literature which outlined methods of Dried Blood Spot analysis were included in the review. We reviewed 824,302citations of peer-reviewed articles, of which 65articles of the 824,302articles were eligible for full review upon analyzing the title and abstract. Of the eligible articles(n= 65), they covered the time period from 1981 -2016 . Collected variables included ISO codes, antigen analyzed, and tested regions.

For a complete description, see the 2016 Annual Dissemination Report of the Gavi Full Country Evaluation: GAVI Full-Country Evaluation Team. GAVI Full Report. Seattle, WA: IHME; 2017 . 6.2.1Sample The sampling design was a stratied, two-stage, clustered random sample. Health facilities were randomly selected, stratied by district in Uganda and Province. Households were randomly selected within catchment areas of health facilities included in the study. Patients were selected as a convenience sample upon exiting facilities on the date of data collection of the HFS. The sampling frame used ofcial facility lists from the Bureau of Statistics of Uganda and Zambia, and a community census of households. Resulting design effects were incorporated into all analyses. Figure 21displays a diagram of the sampling strategy, and Figure 25displays maps of the sampled districts. Figure 21: Study design The effect of study design was considered. Because households were not a simple random sample, the appropriate measures would include adjustment for design effects. We were unable to do so during this analysis. Although techniques for estimating design-adjusted coefcients and standard errors are well established in frequentist approaches to structural equation mod- eling, they are not in the Bayesian context. For details on the frequentist approach, see: Muthen, Bengt O., and Albert Satorra. \"Complex data structural equation modeling.\" Sociologi- cal methodology ( 1995 ):267-316. Leading researchers in Bayesian statistics (Gelman, Andrew, et al. Bayesian data analysis. Vol. 2. Boca Raton, FL, USA: Chapman Hall/CRC, 2014 .) suggest the use of multi-level random effects for design effects in Bayesian models. Such alterations to our 150model were computationally infeasible. Instead, we carried out a sensitivity analysis to explore the impact that this omission may have had on the estimates. We t the model represented in 12 using maximum likelihood estimation (ML) instead Bayesian methods. This enabled us to em- ploy te methods cited above to adjust for study design. Comparing the unadjusted ML estimates to the adjusted ML estimates gives some sense about biases that may be present in the BSEM model. Figure 23shows how the model parameters and standard errors change as a result of design-adjustment. The mid-points were found to change very little, though the standard errors generally increased by a factor of 1.5to2. This would be expected, as design-adjustment often effects uncertainty more than point estimates. Figure 24shows how the rank order of model parameters and standard errors changes as a result of design-adjustment. This gure indicates that while some change occurs, interpretations of model coefcients that make comparisons of their relative magnitude will generally be unaffected by design-adjustment. 6.2.2Data Processing Data processing included a series of steps. Continuous variables were systematically screened for obvious outliers. Missing data were handled in one of two ways: 1) if a value was missing but the correct value was implied by another variable, it was deterministically imputed with that value (e.g. if a child was not vaccinated, the number of doses was set to zero) 2) multiple imputation otherwise. A total of 57child-level variables and 43household-level variables were imputed. Imputation was found to rarely be necessary, because an average of 1.4% (SD: 1.6%) of observations per variable were missing in the child-level variables, and 2.3% (SD: 7.1%) of observations per variable were missing in the household-level variables. Uncertainty from mul- tiple imputation was propagated into all subsequent analysis. Continuous and count variables were log-transformed, and proportions were logit-transformed, when necessary for univariate normality. An offset equal to the minimum non-zero value was added to avoid log of zero. The choice of the minimum was compared to an alternative offset of the 5th percentile. In nearly every case, the model coefcients were negligibly different. It was noted that the coefcient related to Workforce was substantially less negative under the alternative offset. While notable, this did not seem to have a substantive effect on the variance explained by Facility Readiness. Figure 3displays this sensitivity analysis. In certain circumstances, similar binary variables were combined into count variables, representing the number of positive responses among the set of binary variables. See Appendix 2for more details. DBS data were corrected for bias using a novel data correction algorithm, described in Chapter 2. 6.3 bayesian structural equation modeling :further details 6.3.1Latent Variable Analysis Section 3.2.2.2displays the formulae for the complete BSEM of vaccine determinants. This model includes both observed variables and \"latent\" variables. Latent variables are described (among other places) in Kenneth Bollen's seminal 1989 text Structural Equations with Latent Variables (page 11). A latent variable is an unobserved or unmeasurable construct in a model that is hy- pothesized to be the actual explanatory factor for another variable. Bollen describes a latent variable as a \"pure concept\" (page 11), that can only be indirectly measured with data. Exam- ples range from intelligence (which can be indirectly measured with various tests, but never direct known) to the strength of a country's political democracy (which can be indirectly mea- 151sured with characteristics of a political system, but is quite abstract on its own). In this context, structural equations are a tool for measuring an underlying latent variable with error . This is comparatively preferable to ordinary least squares (OLS) for example, in which the researcher must explain why a variable is an appropriate representation of the true latent construct of in- terest through narrative description. In fact, all OLS models implicitly assume that the variables in the model are a perfect representation of their corresponding construct, a fact which is surely untrue for more complex or abstract constructs. The model presented in this study incorporates three different ways of measuring latent vari- ables with structural equations. We borrow language used by prominent authors such as Rex Kline to describe these as \"reflective\", \"formative\" and \"composite\" latent variables. A reflective latent variable is one which is hypothesized to be the cause of variance in its corresponding observed variables. In a typical path diagram, this is represented as arrows from the latent vari- able to the observed variables. Each reflective variable's coefcient is estimated with a different error term. An important assumption is that the covariance between the observed variables is because they all represent the same underlying construct. In other words, it is assumed that reflective variables are independent of each other, conditional on their common latent variable. Other latent variables are the result of their corresponding observed variables however. These are termed formative latent variables, and are represented in a path diagram with an arrow from the observed variables to the latent variable. Under this formulation, no assumptions are made about correlation between formative variables, and only one error term is estimated in the equation; one relating to the latent variable instead of the observed variables. Often, formative and reflective equations are used in combination to measure a single latent variable. Doing so is usually advantageous because it allows more data to be incorporated into a single latent con- struct. Such formulations were termed \"MIMIC\" models by Bollen 1989 , referring to multiple indicators and multiple causes for a latent variable. The model used in this study can be called a MIMIC model as well, since many of the latent variables have formative and reflective equa- tions. The nal approach to dening a latent variable is known as a composite. This approach is well known to statisticians outside of the SEM world as principal components analysis. A composite latent variable is estimated by nding the orthogonal vector to a hyperplane dened by multiple observed variables. Some of the latent variables in this study were measured as composites as well. The decision to represent latent variables as reflective, formative or composite variables was strictly driven by theory. If the hypothesized relationship was reflective, then the latent variable was modeled as such (and vice versa) with no exceptions. 6.3.2Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling The core methodology for the coverage analysis was Bayesian Structural Equation Modeling (BSEM). BSEM is a relatively new approach to traditional SEM, having been rst introduced by Bengt Muth\u00e9n and Tihomir Asparouhov in 2011 'sBayesian SEM: A more flexible representation of substantive theory (Psychological Methods). Supercially, there are two main differences between BSEM and SEM. One is that prior distri- butions are used for all parameter estimates, and the other is that Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (rather than linear or non-linear optimization) is used to nd parameter estimates. These two differences have very meaningful consequences however. Most importantly, the application of priors changes the interpretation of the estimates from frequentist probabilities (relating to hy- pothetical alternate realizations of the data) to Bayesian posteriors which relate more directly to 152the probability of interest (in this case, probability of vaccination). The other consequence is that entire posterior distributions of model parameters are numerically estimated, rather than just midpoints and standard errors. This is useful for continued analysis of model results well after basic observations have been made about the posterior modes. Briefly, Bayesian data analysis likelihood function, estimated from the data and model, P(data )is the prior distribution, specied by the researcher, and P(data )is a normalizing con- stant that can be discarded (resulting in proportionality of the posterior and likelihood/priors, not equality). Muthen and Asparouhov describe four advantages of BSEM of SEM: 1. More can be learned about parameter estimates and model t 2. Better small-sample performance can be obtained and large-sample theory is not needed 3. Analysis can be made less computationally demanding 4. New types of models can be analyzed One important point is number 2, better small-sample performance. This, the authors argue, means that the model is less prone to \"Heywood cases\", or nuisance model convergence is- sues common in complex frequentist SEMs. Indeed, during this analysis, we noted occasional Heywood cases (also termed improper solutions) such as slightly-negative variance terms and non-invertible covariance matrices which render computation of standard errors impossible. Such improper solutions were never found in BSEM models. Observation number 4was also seen to be a benet in this analysis. Because prior distributions could come from any family, we could more closely approximate our hypothetical model by specifying that certain model coefcients were gamma-distributed and no normally-distributed, meaning they were strictly positive. Although frequentist SEM allows equality constraints, pre-specifying the distribution of a parameter was found to be much more robust. The model was t using the blavaan software package for R (https://cran.r-project.org/web/ packages/blavaan/index.html), which relies on JAGS for MCMC. All models were t with three MCMC chains and assessed for convergence. All models converged with an MCMC adaptation phase of 1,000steps, burn-in of 14,000steps, sample of 6,000steps and thinning interval of 3. 6.3.2.1Estimation of Explained Variance Section 3.3.1displays and discusses explained variance statistics for the primary endogenous variable in each model, vaccine coverage. As a commonsense denition, explained variance is the proportion of the overall variation in one variable that is accounted for by one of its explanatory variables. To abuse causal terminology for a moment, explained variance indicates how much of the variability in vaccine coverage is the result of a particular determinant. Being at the heart of the research question, this is often a useful statistic to estimate. Explained variance is inherently estimated in every structural equation model. This is because SEMs estimate coefcients using the variance-covariance structure of the variables, not the mean 153structure like generalized linear models. Explained variance in a SEM is related to what are known as standardized coefcients, or coefcients relating a standard deviation change in one variable to a standard deviation change in another. In Structural Equations with Latent Variables , Kenneth Bollen shows (on page 349) that standardized coefcients can be obtained directly from typical SEM model output. Bollen represents (on page 319) a general SEM with a latent model (termed \"structural model\" this work): \u0011= \u0011+\u0000\u0018+\u0010 y=\u0003y\u0011+\u000f x =\u0003x\u0018+\u000e (19) Bollen 1989 goes (page 349) on to show that to standardize any of the \u0003, , or\u0000coefcients, a simple formula can model-predicted Bollen puts it: \"the standardized coefcient is the expected shift in standard deviation units of the dependent variable that is due to a one standard deviation shift in the independent variable when the other variables are held constant.\" The important implication of this is most succinctly described in Rex Kline's 2012 text Princi- ples and Practices of Structural Equation Modeling (page 160). Kline makes two observations about explained variance. First, because coefcients are estimated based on variance structure, the un- standardized error (disturbance) term on a particular endogenous variable directly represents the unexplained variance of the variable. The ratio of the error term's variance to the variable's observed variance is thus the proportion of variance left unexplained by the model. Kline also points out that the standardized coefcients sum to 1minus the unexplained variance by de- nition . Therefore, understanding the proportion of variance in an outcome that is explained by each predictor variable is simply a matter of standardization. Computing uncertainty intervals for explained variance requires slightly more effort. Stan- dard errors of standardized coefcients can readily be obtained from model variances as well, as Bollen shows on page 350. Because the explained variance statistics are constrained to the [0,1] interval however, these standard errors cannot be directly used to compute 95% upper and lower uncertainty intervals. As with any typical analysis of coefcients on the [ 0,1] interval (typ- ically probabilities), uncertainty intervals were computed in logit-space, then back-transformed to \"natural\" space afterward 6.3.3Variables Used in Model In section 3.2.2.2, a number of observed variables are introduced, and 12equations are pre- sented to relate them together. Here, we offer description of the formulation and rational for each observed variable. Variables are discussed in the order they appear in table 6. The precise evidence based for each of these variables (among others) is presented in 1. 154Child Age Child age was included in this model primarily as a control for time. Numerous studies have shown that vaccine coverage tends to increase over time, and this was found to be true in Uganda and Zambia. In order to avoid confounding, we computed child age in years based on the date of survey and date of birth. Vehicles The number of vehicles owned by a health facility was hypothesized to be a key driver of Supply. In many circumstances, it was found that facility staff were responsible for retrieving vaccine supplies from their corresponding district health ofce. This was represented as a count variable in the model. Distance Distance from a child's household to their nearest health facility was hypothesized to be a key barrier to Access and Perceived control. This variable was measured as straight-line distance using GPS coordinates collected at both facility and household. Outreach Frequency (Com.) The frequency of outreach activities was hypothesized to in- fluence Perceived Norms, because heightened health system presence may impact perceptions about the number of other children in the community who are being vaccinated. This indicator was measured at the community-level by asking mothers how often they see outreaches in their area. This variable was represented as a categorical variable (dummy variables) in the model. Perceived Preventable Vaccine This variable represents whether or not the mother perceives that pneumonia is preventable by PCV . This was hypothesized to be reflective of attitudes about vaccines, since is inherently reflects beliefs about PCV . This was represented as a binary variable. Static Frequency (Fac.) The frequency of static vaccine services was hypothesized to be reflective of the facility Workforce, since a larger workforce will be able to offer more services. This variable was represented as a categorical variable (dummy variables) in the model. Immunization Staff The number of immunization staff was hypothesized to be formative of Workforce, since more staff should (all else equal) be able to vaccinate more children. This was represented as a count variable in the model. Perceived Purpose This variable represents a composite of a \"select all that apply\" type question from the household survey. Mothers were asked what they believe is the purpose of vaccination, and all responses (true or not) were tallied. This variable is hypothesized to be reflective of Attitudes because a mother who believes that vaccines hold many purposes is likely to have a more positive attitude about vaccines. This was represented as a count variable in the model. Perceived Preventative This variable also represents a composite of a \"select all that apply\" type question from the household survey. Mothers were asked which disease symptoms could be prevented by vaccines, and all responses (true or not) were tallied. This variable is hypoth- esized to be reflective of Attitudes because a mother who believes that vaccines prevent many diseases is likely to have a more positive attitude about vaccines. This was represented as a count variable in the model. Difculty This variable also represents a composite of a \"select all that apply\" type question from the household survey. Mothers were asked what difculties they faced while vaccinating their most recent child, and all Access-related difculties were tallied. This variable is hypoth- esized to be reflective of Perceived Control because if a mother recalls more difculties, she is more likely to perceive that she has little control over successfully vaccinating her child. This was represented as a count variable in the model. Wealth Household wealth was hypothesized to be a component of Access, since household with more means are more likely to be able to overcome certain barriers. This variable was 155measured as a composite of 27wealth-related variables such as asset ownership, home size and education. This variable was represented as a continuous variable in the model. Parity The number of children a mother has in the household was hypothesized to be a com- ponent of Access, since the ability to spare time from child care may be a barrier to vaccination. This was represented as a count variable in the model. Cost The total cost of vaccination (including transportation) was hypothesized to be a compo- nent of Access, since cost is often a key barrier to health service utilization. Cost was measured as a community-wide average to avoid endogeneity with vaccine status (i.e. unvaccinated chil- dren incurred no cost, but that doesn't imply that there is a strong positive correlation between cost and vaccination). This variable was measured by self-report by respondents, and was rep- resented as a continuous variable in the model. Avoidance This variable also represents a composite of a \"select all that apply\" type ques- tion from the household survey. Mothers were asked multiple questions about why they did not vaccinate, why they might not vaccinate, or why they experienced difculty vaccinating their child. All responses related to fears and concerns about vaccines themselves were tallied. This variable was hypothesized to be reflective of Attitudes because mother who report more avoidance-related beliefs are less likely to have a positive attitude towards vaccines. This was represented as a count variable in the model. Social Network This variable also represents a composite of a \"select all that apply\" type question from the household survey. Mothers were asked multiple questions about their sources of information about PCV and other vaccines, and the number of responses related to friends and family members were tallied. This variable was hypothesized to be formative of Perceived Norms, because respondents who hear about vaccines through their social networks are more likely to perceive that their peers are vaccinating their children. This was represented as a count variable in the model. Outreach Frequency (Fac.) The frequency of outreach vaccine services (reported by the fa- cility) was hypothesized to be reflective of the facility Workforce, since a larger workforce will be able to offer more services. This variable was represented as a categorical variable (dummy variables) in the model. Previous Failed Attempt This variable also represents a composite of a \"select all that ap- ply\" type question from the household survey. Mothers were asked multiple questions about why they did not vaccinate, why they might not vaccinate, or why they experienced difculty vaccinating their child. All responses related to aspects beyond their control (stock-outs, facility closures etc.) were tallied. This variable was hypothesized to be formative of Perceived Control because mothers who experience such circumstances in a previous failed attempt at vaccination are less likely to perceive that they have self-efcacy. This was represented as a count variable in the model. TBA Reliance This variable represents a composite of multiple health services utilization questions such as antenatal care and birth attendance. The number of health services that were performed by a traditional birth attendant or traditional health care provider (e.g. traditional healers) were tallied. This was hypothesized to be reflective of Attitudes since mothers who rely on traditional birth attendants are less likely to hold positive attitudes towards established health systems. This was represented as a count variable in the model. Vaccine Stockouts This variable represents a composite of multiple stock-out related ques- tions asked at health facilities. Respondents were asked about which supplies were stocked out for varying lengths of time in the previous three months, and the number of positive responses 156was tallied. This is hypothesized to be reflective of Supply, since a consistent and high-quality supply chain will have fewer stockouts. This was represented as a count variable in the model. Push Delivery This variable represents whether vaccines supplies are delivered to a health facility or retrieved by facility health workers. This was hypothesized to be formative of Sup- ply since delivery logistics may impact supply chain quality. This was represented as a binary variable in the model. Community Coverage This variable represents the proportion of children vaccinated in a child's community, besides the child him/herself. This variable was hypothesized to be forma- tive of Perceived Norms because if more children in a community are vaccinated, a mother may perceive that it is normal to do so. It was also hypothesized to by formative of Workforce, be- cause the effects of staff and catchment population (other Workforce indicators) are confounded by patient volume. This variable was represented as a logit-transformed fraction in the model. Transport Cost This variable was hypothesized to be reflective of Perceived Control because it is a self-report of how expensive transportation would be. Mothers who believe (correctly or not) that transportation to the health facility would be expensive are less likely to believe they have control over vaccination of their child. This was represented as a continuous variable in the model. Perceived Availability This variable was hypothesized to be reflective of Perceived Control because mothers who believe that vaccine services are more-frequently offered at their health facility are more likely to believe that they have control of vaccination of their child. This variable was represented as a categorical variable (dummy variables) in the model. Static Frequency (Com.) This variable was hypothesized to be Outreach Convenient The frequency of static vaccine services was hypothesized to influ- ence Perceived Control, because heightened health system presence may impact perceptions about accessibility of health services. This indicator was measured at the community-level by asking mothers how often they see outreaches in their area. This variable was represented as a categorical variable (dummy variables) in the model. Travel Time This variable was hypothesized to be reflective of Perceived Control because it is a self-report of how time-consuming transportation would be. Mothers who believe (correctly or not) that transportation to the health facility would be time-consuming are less likely to believe they have control over vaccination of their child. This was represented as a continuous variable in the model. Total Staff The total number of staff in a facility was hypothesized to be formative of Work- force, since more staff should (all else equal) be able to vaccinate more children. This was represented as a count variable in the model. DHO Distance Distance from the DHO to the facility was hypothesized to be formative of Supply, since facilities that are farther away from their corresponding DHO may face more logistical challenges in obtaining vaccine supplies. This was measured as straight-line distance using GPS coordinates collected at both facility and DHO. Penta Delivery Prop. The proportion of vaccine supply requests (from facility to DHO) that were ultimately fullled (by the DHO) was hypothesized to be reflective of Supply, since a con- sistent and high-quality supply chain will have higher order fulllment. This was represented as a logit-transformed fraction in the model. Median Order Size The median size of vaccine supply requests (from facility to DHO) was hypothesized to be formative of Supply, because it was noted that some facilities place large, 157infrequent order while others place small, frequent orders, and patterns of ordering have been shown to be drivers of supply chain quality. This was represented as a continuous variable in the model. Days Between Orders The frequency of vaccine supply requests (from facility to DHO) was hypothesized to be formative of Supply, because it was noted that some facilities place large, infrequent order while others place small, frequent orders, and patterns of ordering have been shown to be drivers of supply chain quality. This was represented as a continuous variable in the model. Deviation from Med. Order The maximum deviation from the median vaccine supply re- quest (from facility to DHO) was hypothesized to be reflective of Supply, because it was noted that some facilities respond to an unexpected stock out by placing a single, large compensating order. Facilities which had a large maximum deviation were therefore hypothesized to have had stock outs in recent times. This was represented as a continuous variable in the model. Between Order Variance The variability from one vaccine supply request (from facility to DHO) to the next was hypothesized to be reflective of Supply, because it may either indicate a certain level of disorganization in the facility, or that a facility is more responsive to recent consumption of supplies. This was represented as a continuous variable in the model. Catchment Population The size of the community served by a health facility was hypoth- esized to be formative of Workforce, because the effects of staff (another Workforce) is con- founded by patient volume. This was represented as a count variable in the model. Wait Time (PES) Average patient wait time at a health facility was hypothesized to be re- flective of Workforce, because a facility with sufcient staff to meet patient volume is expected to have lower average wait times. This variable was measured through patient self-report upon exiting health facilities. Patients reported experienced wait times, and reported wait times were averaged across health facilities. This was represented as a continuous variable in the model. 6.4 robustness checks 6.4.1Sensitivity to Prior Specication One potential area of concern in any Bayesian model is the influence of the priors distribu- tions over the posterior distributions. As described in section 3.2.2.3, priors were in the gamma distribution for all parameters which were constrained to be positive, and normal distribution otherwise. If a normally-distributed parameter was expected to be positive, its mean was set to 1, if a normally-distributed parameter was expected to be negative, its mean was set to - 1, and 0otherwise. Both normal and gamma priors were set with wide (diffuse) dispersion in order to allow the data to drive the ultimate parameter estimates. In order to test robustness to specication of priors, ve alternative priors were tested: \u000fMore Narrow A model with the same gamma distributions, same normal means, but more narrow normal dispersion. The precision parameter of 0.01was changed to 0.5to form reasonably-narrow prior distribution. \u000fMore Positive A model with the same normal distributions, but gamma distributions of gamma( 2,1) instead of gamma( 1,1). This forms a distribution with a high density interval that is more positive than gamma( 1,1). 158\u000fMore Narrow and Positive A combination of the previous two models. Gamma distribu- tions set to gamma( 2,1) and normal distribution precision set to 0.5. \u000fMore Informative A model with even more narrow and positive distributions than the previous model. Gamma distributions set to gamma( 2,4), and normal distribution preci- sion set to 2. \u000fDifferent Distribution A model which used an alternative positive-bound distribution to the gamma distributions. Log-normal priors with mean of 0and precision of 1were used. This prior was chosen to resemble the gamma( 1,1) prior in shape, but reflect an alternative assumption about the family of the distribution. Figure 26displays the results from this sensitivity analysis for PCV 1in Uganda. These gures show the comparison between the \"accepted model\" (the model from which results are displayed in the main text) each alternative specication. Points in these graphs represent individual pa- rameter estimates, and are colored by whether they are coefcients, intercepts, variances or covariances. Points that fall along the diagonal line indicate that this model parameter changed very little when different priors were used. The graphs show that the majority of parameter estimates were unaffected by prior specication; they remained the same under all ve models. The interpretation of this sensitivity analysis is that the model results are truly a reflection of patterns in the data, and not the result of unjustiably-influential prior distributions. Identical tests were conducted for all other outcomes and showed similar results. 6.4.2Sensitivity to Model Specication Another robustness check relates to model specication. With as many as 36observed variables in the model, a concern may be \"high-leverage variables\", akin to high-leverage data points. Such variables, if they exist, might shed doubt on the robustness of the model since they would explain much of the ndings. We tested for sensitivity to variable inclusion using leave-one-out analysis. Separate models were run, each model excluding a different variable. The results were collated and compared using the six performance metrics (mentioned in section 3.2.2.3). All performance metrics compare the predicted vaccine status of each child to their actual status. These performance metrics were: \u000fSensitivity The proportion of vaccinated children who were correctly classied. \u000fSpecicity The proportion of unvaccinated children who were correctly classied. \u000fPositive Predictive Value (PPV) The proportion of predicted-to-be-vaccinated children who actually were vaccinated. \u000fNegative Predictive Value (NPV) The proportion of predicted-to-be-unvaccinated chil- dren who actually were unvaccinated. \u000fConcordance The proportion of all children who were correctly classied. \u000fDistance The geometric distance (square root of the sum of squared differences) between perfect sensitivity and specicity and observed sensitivity and specicity. 159Using these metrics, all leave-one-out model variants were evaluated in addition to the ac- cepted model. The bars in gure 27show model performance, sorted in descending order for Pentavalent- 3in Uganda. The green bars highlight where the accepted model falls among all variants. Models further to the left (except in the distance plot) indicate better model perfor- mance. In general, the accepted model was found to be average among all model variants. The accepted model fell in the middle of the distribution for sensitivity and NPV , and towards the upper end of the distribution for specicity and PPV . Concordance was moderate relative to other models, and distance was low. The graphs show that the accepted model was not excep- tional among alternative models, and that no clear high-leverage variables exist. The interpretation of this sensitivity analysis is that the exact conguration of observed vari- ables in the model did not have undue influence over the results. There is no single variable that, if excluded, would lead to drastically different performance. The accepted model was chosen on the basis of theory, so is preferred. 160Figure 22: Districts sampled 161Figure 23: Sensitivity to study design: Comparison of model parameters before and after adjustment Figure 24: Sensitivity to study design: Comparison of rank order of model parameters before and after adjustment 162Figure 25: Sensitivity to data processing: different offset for log transformation Figure 26: Sensitivity to prior specication 163Figure 27: Sensitivity to model specication The BSEM was re-run 36, times, leaving one variable out at a time.
