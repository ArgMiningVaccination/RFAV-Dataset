To improve good governance, transparency, fairness, competition, and value for money in public procurement, the Government of India has taken a number of significant policy initiatives in public procurement in the recent past. The General Financial Rules were revised comprehensively in March 2017, covering inter-alia this set of new initiatives. Consequently, the Manual for Procurement of Goods, 2017; Manual for Procurement of Consultancy and Other Services, 2017 and Manual for Procurement of Works, 2019 were also developed. 2. Tender documents are the ultimate vehicle for implementing such policy initiatives on the ground. If all procurements use a uniform set of tender documents, the impact of policy initiatives' gets amplified, bringing economies of scale and increased competition. Bidders also get broader market access for their products. 3. Therefore, this Model Tender Document (MTD) has been developed for the procurement of Goods.This MTD rationalises and simplifies the usual structure of tender documents. Besides aligning its provisions with various procurement policies, it incorporates national and international best practices and breaks some new grounds. In two stages, extensive consultations were done with Ministries/ Departments/ Central Public Sector Undertakings (CPSUs), other organisations and individuals to develop this document. A unique feature of this MTD is its availability as a software template which can be customised with the names and requirements of user organisations. 4. Detailed guidance is provided at appropriate places in the MTD, and a separate detailed Guidance Note is also attached to help the procuring officials. 5. MTDs issued by this Department are to be taken as guiding templates. Ministries/ Departments are advised to suitably customise this document to suit their local/ specialised needs. Government e-Marketplace (GeM), Central Public Procurement Portal (CPPP) and other e-procurement portals should host this MTD on their portals so as to help procuring entities to customise and make use of the MTD. This is first edition of the MTD and this Department welcomes any suggestion or comment on this document for further improvement. 6. I would like to acknowledge the lead taken by Shri Sanjay Aggarwal, Advisor (PPD), Shri Kanwalpreet, Director (PPD) and the role of Shri Girish Bhatnagar, Consultant (Public Procurement) in the development of this Model Tender Document. I would also like to thank Ministries, Departments, other organisations, and individuals who reviewed the drafts of the Model Tender Document and provided their valuable inputs. 7. I hope that this Model Tender Document would help procuring officials working in various Ministries/ Departments and Public Enterprises as a guiding template, deepen the impact of policy initiatives mentioned above and improve the ease of doing business with the Government.

The landed price would not be the same for two bidders , even if any bidder makes such an attempt. While evaluating the bids, the exchange rate captured by the e -procurement system shall be considered for converting foreign currency into Indian Rupees. On the auction's closing time expiry , the bid history showing all the last valid bids offered along with the name of the bidders shall be published . All bid ders shall have the facility to see and get a print of the same for their record. All electronic bids submitted during the reverse auction process shall be legally binding on the bidder. Only the chronologically last bid submitted by Bidder until the end of the auction shall be considered the valid financial bid of Bidder, and Procurement of GOODS Section II: Instructions To Bidders (ITB) [41] consideration of the same for entering into a contract by the Procuring Entity shall bind on the bidder. If a bidder does not submit his bid in the Reverse Auction, the price quoted in the financial bid shall be considered the valid price of that bidder. The status of Bidder (L-1, L-2 etc.) shall be evaluated considering either the bid price submitted in Reverse auction or the Price quoted in the financial bid, whichever is lower. The successful L-1 bidder , after the reverse auction , has to upload within a stipulated period (within 2 working days, if not specified) the breakup of Landed Prices in the shortfall documents, at which the contract shall be awarded. While giving the break up, the Bidder shall include the same taxes and duties as quoted while submitting the financial bid.

Tender Document - Tend No./ xxxx [42] Procuring Organisation 12.4.6 Consideration of Abnormally Low Bids An Abnormally Low bid is one in which the bid price, in combination with other elements of the bid, appears so low that it raises substantive concerns as to the Bidder's capability to perform the contract at the offered price. Procuring Entity shall in such cases seek written clarifications from the Bidder, including detailed price analyses of its bid price concerning scope, schedule, allocation of risks and responsibilities, and any othe r requirements of the Tender Document . If, after evaluating the price analyses, procuring entity determines that Bidder has substantively failed to demonstrate its capability to deliver the contract at the offered price, the Procuring Entity shall reject the bid/ proposal , and evaluation shall proceed with the next ranked bidder. 12.4.7 Price Negotiation Usually, there shall be no price negotiations. However, the Procuring Entity reserves its right to negotiate with the lowest acceptable bidder (L -1), who is techno -commercially suitable for supplying bulk quantity and on whom the contract would have been placed but for the decision to negotiate . This right shall also apply to post eReverse Auction process. 13. Award of Contract 13.1 The Procuring Entity 's Right s 13.1.1 Right to Vary Quantities at the Time of Award At the time of contract award, the Procuring Entity reserves the right to increase or decrease , without any change in the unit prices or other terms and conditions of the bid and the Tender Document , the quanti ty of Goods originally stipulated in Section VI: Schedule of Requirements, provided this increase/ decrease does not exceed 25 (twenty -five) percent of tendered quantity (or any other percentage indicated in the Tender Document). 13.1.2 Parallel Contracts or Spli tting of Award The Procuring Entity reserves its right to split the quantities and conclude Parallel contracts with more than one bidder (for the same tender) in the following circumstances: Unless otherwise stipulated in TIS/ AITB, there shall be no paral lel orders or splitting quantities among more than one Bidders. After due processing, if it is discovered that the quantity to be ordered is far more than what L -1 alone is capable of supplying and there was no prior stipulation in the Tender Document for parallel contracts , then it reserves its rights to distribute the quantity being finally ordered, among the other bidders by counter offering the L -1 rate to willing L-2 or higher bidders , in a transparent manner to avail full assessed capacities of lower -priced bidders first, before inviting higher -priced bidders . The decision of Procuring Entity shall be final. However, if the Tender Document stipulates such parallel contracts due to the critical / strategic / specific nature of the supplies / Goods , the manner of deciding relative share of the lowest bidder (L -1) and the rest shall be clearly defined, along with the minimum number of Bidders sought (subject to availability of suitable bids meeting the requirements) for the contract. In such cases , the bidders should not quote for less than 25% of the tendered quantity; otherwise, their offer shall be rejected as nonresponsive . Unless otherwise stipulated in the AITB , in case of splitting in two and three, the ratio of 70:30; 50:30:20, respectively shall be used. These ratios are approximate, and the Procuring Entity reserves its right to marginally vary quantities to suit capacity / past performance of the bidder / unit loads Procurement of GOODS Section II: Instructions To Bidders (ITB) [43] of packing or transportation / relative ranking of the bids/ delivery period offered/ existing load o f Bidder and other similar factors affecting smooth supplies as per requirements . 13.1.3 Additional Conditions for Rate Contracts If stipulated expressly in the TIS/ AITB that this is a Tender Process to enter into \"Rate Contract(s)\" for the supply of Goods, then the following additional conditions shall be applicable: The conditions governing the resultant Rate Contract would be as per G.C.C -clause 6.8.

Parallel Rate Contracts: Procuring Entity reserves the right to conclude more than one rate contract for the same Schedule / Goods . The procedure for negotiation and counter -offering for concluding parallel rate contracts would be as f ollows. Initially, the rate contract would be awarded to the L -1 Bidder . Then the price of L -1 shall be counter -offered to the higher quoting responsive Bidder s (under intimation to L-1), asking them to send their revised Bids online on the e -procurement portal to be opened at a specified place, date, and time (as per the standard procedure). L-1 Bidder would be specifically informed that it may, if it so desires, reduce its price and send its revised Bid accordingly. The Bidder s, who accept the counter - offered rate or rate lower than that, would be awarded parallel rate contracts. If L -1 Bidder lowers its rate in its revised offer, the same would also be accepted with effect from that date, and its rate contract amended accordingly. In the case where parallel rate contracts are necessary, but even the lowest responsive Bidder (L-1) price is not reasonable. In that case, price negotiation may be conducted with L -1 Bidder in the first instance. If the L1 Bidder agrees to bring down the price to the desired level, a rate contract would be concluded with it, and parallel rate contracts would be concluded as per the sub-clause above . If, however, L1 Bidder does not agree to reduce its price in the first instance itself, then the price, which has been d ecided as reasonable, would be counter -offered to all the higher quoting responsive Bidder s (including L -1) for further action on the above lines. All such parallel rate contracts would be released transparently and simultaneously. The quantities mentione d in the tender in Section - I (N.I.T.) and Section -VI (Schedule of Requirements) are indicative without any commitment on a rate -contract basis, as detailed in G.C.C -clause 6.8 . 13.2 Letter of Award ( Acceptance - LoA) and Signing of Contract 13.2.1 Selection of Succes sful Bidder(s) The Procuring Entity shall award the contract to the Bidder(s) whose bid(s) is Techno - commercially suitable and bid price(s) is lowest and reasonable , as per evaluation criteria detailed in the Tender Document. 13.2.2 Verification of Original Docum ents Before issuing a Letter of Award (LoA) to the successful Bidder(s), the Procuring Entity may, at its discretion , ask Bidder to submit online for verification the originals of all such Tender Document - Tend No./ xxxx [44] Procuring Organisation documents whose scanned copies were submitted online along with the Technical bid. If so decided, t he photocopies of such self -certified documents shall be verified and signed by the competent officer and kept in the records as part of the contract agreeme nt. If the Bidder fails to provide such originals or in case of substantive discrepancies in such documents, it shall be construed as a violation of the Code of Integrity . Such bid shall be liable to be rejected as nonresponsive in addition to other puniti ve actions in the Tender Document . The evaluation of Bids shall proceed with the subsequent ranked offers. 13.2.3 Letter of Award (LoA) The Bidder, whose bid has been accepted and documents verified (at the discretion of Procuring Entity) , shall be notified of the award by the Procuring Entity before the expiration of the Bid-Validity period by written or electronic means .

Applicability 1.1 This document is advisory and aims to facilitate Procuring Entities in prepar ing Tender Document for Procurement of Goods . The document is based on General Financial Rules 2017, Manual for Procurement of Goods 2017 as amended until publishing. This document does not intend to replace alternative Tender Document as agreed (if any) with the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), i.e. The World Bank, Asian Development Bank etc., for procurements financed by loans/ grants extended by such MDBs. 1.2 This Document is for use by Central Government Ministries/ Departments and their attached and subordinate offices, Central Public Sector Entities, Autonomous Bodies and Statutory Bodies. There is no restriction on its adoption by State Governments or other agencies 1.3 Major Goods procuring Ministries/ Departments inter -alia Ministry of Defence; Ministry of Railways and certain large CPSEs, who have well -established Tender Documents for their unique individual requirement may continue to use such documents. They may, however, use this document for guidance to revise their documents. 1.4 The Model T ender Document is generic for open tenders through the GePNIC portal . It is not suitable for procurement below the threshold for Open Tender (Rs 25 Lakh, or any other amount in your Schedule of Powers), which require only a short Tender Document. 2. Nomenclat ure Conundrum There is no standardised nomenclature in Public Procurement in India, and a mix of American, European, and British/ Indian nomenclature has become common. 'Tender' is taken to mean (i) 'Tender Document' or 'Tender Process' as well as (ii) the 'Bid' submitted by the bidders. The Tender Document floated by Procuring Entity is also called a Bid Document. Similarly, participants in a Tender are alternatively called tenderers and bidders. This duality is reflected in \"Notice Inviting Tenders' and ' Instructions to Bidders' etc. Although this is not an appropriate forum to discuss this topic in detail that it deserves, an attempt is made to standardise for this document 'Tender' for the (i) above and Bid for (ii) and hence Bidder is used instead of T enderer, and the document is being called 'Tender Document' instead of 'Bid Document'. Similar attempts are made to standardise other nomenclature in this document without disturbing the nomenclature embedded in the CPPP portal. 3. The process to modify Custo m fields in the generic Model Tender Document to suit your Organisation and a specific procurement 3.1 Certain generic variables used throughout the document are embedded as the Custom fields in the word file. These fields (refer para 4 and 6 below) can be changed in one go throughout the document (including headers and footers) to suit your Organisation. The process to change these fields in the Model Tender Document file is as follows: a) Click 'File' (top left) menu, and in the \"File' menu, select 'Info' (4 th from top) on the left side panel Guidance Note for the Goods - Model Tender Document [ii] b) On the right -side panel of Info is 'Properties' and dropdown to click 'Advance Properties' c) Select the 'Custom' tab in 'Advanced Properties'. d) Select the specific property in the custom tab and 'Modify' in the 'value' box and click 'OK' to save. e) Make such changes to all the fields to be changed. f) To populate these changed fields throughout the document (including headers or footers): from the editing menu, 'select all' (or Ctrl+A to select all text) to select t he whole document. g) Press F9 to update all fields (some computers need Fn+F9). Verify if changes have occurred in the document. h) Save the Model Tender Document file under a new name. Procurement of GOODS Guidance Note for the Goods - Model Tender Document [iii] 4. Customise Model Tender Document to serve as a Model Tender Document for your Organisation. Firstly, customise the Model Tender Document to reflect the custom fields that would apply to all future procurements so that the document becomes a Model Tender Document for your Organisation. These are: a) Name of Custom Field and existin g value: 'On behalf of' and 'President of India' ('the' article is in the text). In the Central Government entities, tenders are invited on behalf of the 'President of India'. No change is required for such entities. In the case of CPSE or States, this may be suitably changed to the 'Chairman and Managing Director (CMD)' or the 'Governor of -------- '. b) Name of Custom Field and existing value: 'Procuring Organisation' and 'Procuring Organisation'. The actual name of the Organisation can be substituted here (e .g., Department of Expenditure). c) Name of Custom Field and existing value: 'The Legal Head' and 'Head of the Procuring Organisation'. The Head of the Organisation usually is the authority that appoints Arbitrators and Conciliators. The authority's actual de signation (for such appointments) can be substituted here (e.g., Jt Secretary). d) Name of Custom Field and existing value: 'Procuring Entity' and 'Procuring Entity'. This entity floats the Tender. The actual name of such entity can be substituted here (e.g., Procurement Policy Division). e) Name of Custom Field and existing value: 'Head of Procurement' and 'Head of Procurement'. The Head of the Procuring Entity is usually the competent financial authority for procurement matters. The authority's actual designati on (for such procurement powers) can be substituted here (e.g., General Manager Procurement). f) Name of Custom Field and existing value: 'eProcurement URL' and 'https://eprocure.gov.in/eprocure/app '. This f ield is the URL address of the e - Procurement portal used by the Organisation. If different than this, the actual URL used by the Organisation can be substituted here. g) Name of Custom Field and existing value: 'Tender Inviting Authority' and 'Tender Inviting Authority'. This officer (named TIA in the portal) uploads the Tender Document and is the nodal officer interacting with the e -Procurement portal. If more than one TIAs are there, then do this modification for each specific procurement document and not in the Organisation's Model Tender Document. Otherwise, actual designation (for such function) can be substituted here (e.g., Dy. Manager). h) Since such changes are not likely to page pagination, there is no need to update the Table of Content. i) After making th ese modifications save the file under a suitable name as the Model Tender Document for your Organisation. This Model RfP can be used in all future procurements of Goods in the Organisation. 5. Customise Model Tender Document for a specific Type of Tender Proc ess 5.1 The Model Tender Document, and as it stands, is customised for Single Stage, Two Covers, Domestic Open Tenders through GePNIC eProcurement of general Goods. With suitable customisation, it can be used for Capital Goods, Rate -Contract, Tender -cum- Auction; Single Cover, or the second stage of two -stage/ Pre -Qualification Bidding (PQB) after shortlisting of qualified bidders in the EoI/ PQB stage. 5.2 As a convention, in the Model Tender Document, all grey text in italics within curly brackets {as at the beginning of TIS} must be deleted before publishing. All grey text in italics Guidance Note for the Goods - Model Tender Document [iv] within square/ box brackets [as in the tabular entries in TIS] must be replaced by appropriate information . 5.3 Instead of two Covers system of tendering , a Single Cover syste m Make changes in the following sections of the Model Tender Document : a) Appendix to NIT (TIS) - in 1.0 Basic Details - No. of Covers b) Section III: AITB - in ITB 12.2.2 5.3 Instead of a Single -Stage Bidding system, the s econd stage of two -stage/ Pre- Qualification Bidding (PQB) after shortlisting of qualified bidders in the EoI/ PQB stage Make changes in the following sections of the Model Tender Document : a) Appendix to NIT (TIS) - in 1.0 Basic Details - Bidding System b) Section III: AITB - in ITB 12.2 .2 5.4 instead of Open Tender - Domestic a Global Tender Enquiry Make changes in the following sections of the Model Tender Document : a) Appendix to NIT (TIS) - in 1.0 Basic Details - Tender Type b) Section III: AITB - in ITB 6.1.6 and 12.4.2. Here any other detail like currencies allowed to be quoted etc., may be added. 5.5 If an e -Reverse auction is to follow the usual Financial Bid opening in Tender - cum-Auction System Make changes in the following sections of the Model Tender Document : a) Appendix to NIT (TIS) - in 1.0 Basic Details - e-Reverse Auction b) Section III: AITB - in ITB 12.4.3. Here any other relevant details may be added. 5.6 Procurement of Capital Goods/ Machinery and Plant Special provisions are needed in case of such procurements. Make change s in the following sections of the Model Tender Document : a) Appendix to NIT (TIS) - in 1.0 Basic Details - Tender Category b) Section III: AITB - in ITB 6.1.3. Here any other relevant details may be added. c) Section V: SCC - in GCC 6.1, 6.6, 6.7. Also, mention an y incidental works/ services required, e.g., installation, commissioning, operator's training, AMC etc. 5.7 For entering into Rate Contracts Special provisions are needed in case of such procurements. Make changes in the following sections of the Model Ten der Document : a) Appendix to NIT (TIS) - in 1.0 Basic Details - Tender Type b) Section III: AITB - in ITB 13.1.3. Here any other relevant details may be added. c) Section V: SCC - GCC 10.1.6 - invoke applicability of fall clause. 6. Modify Custom Fields in Model Tende r Document for a specific procurement a) Name of Custom Field and existing value: 'Tender Inviting Authority' and 'Tender Inviting Authority'. If your Organi sation has different TIAs for different tenders, then the actual designation of the TIA should be modi fied for each specific procurement , as per para 4 g) above . Otherwise, don't change this field. b) Name of Custom Field and existing value: 'Subject Matter of Procurement' and 'GOODS'. A short description of the Goods being procured is mentioned in the headers and at other places in the Tender Document. Substitute here the short description of Goods bei ng procured (e.g., Printer Paper A4, white, 75 gsm). The Procurement of GOODS Guidance Note for the Goods - Model Tender Document [v] Rate Contract tender process should mention 'To enter into Rate Contracts for the supply of (name of the Goods)'. c) Name of Custom Field and existing value: 'Document Number' and ' Tend No./ xxxx '. Tender (Reference) Number is mentioned in the headers and at other places in the Tender Document. Substitute the actual Tender Number here. You would not have to type this information repeatedly. 7. Filling data for a specific procurement 7.1 Portions that need not be modified for a specific procurement: A significant portion (75%) of the Model Tender Document need not be modified for a specific procurement. These portions are: a) Section I: Notice Inviting Tender ( NIT):. The NIT provides sufficient information to Bidders to help in decid ing on participation . It gets customised through the custom fields as in para 4 and 6 above. It is designed to separate variable information in its appendix - Tender Information Summary (TIS). TIS also serves as a central repository of Tender parameters along with AITB (Appendix to ITB). Therefore, the NIT does not require modification for a specific procurement. b) Section II: Instructions to Bidders ( ITB) - It provides instructions and information to Bidders regarding the Tender Proces s upto Letter of Award (LoA). ITB need not be changed since any changes required are to be entered in Section III: Appendix to ITB (AITB ). of Contract ( GCC ). It contains standard conditions of the contract. It is designed to be self-contained without reference to other sections, except SCC . GCC need not be changed since any changes required are to be entered in Section V: Special Conditions of Contract (SCC). d) All Bidding Forms are to be filled by the Bidders and hence should b e left unchanged. e) All Formats also are to be left unchanged 7.2 Portions to be filled in for a specific procurement: A small portion (approx. 10%) of the Model Tender Document need to be modified for a specific procurement. These are: f) Tender Information Su mmary (TIS, appendix to NIT) contains variable information of the NIT. It supplements AITB in providing salient parameters of Tender in tabular form, which used to be earlier interspersed all over the older Tender Documents. Sufficient guidance is written in the TIS to guide you in filling it. Also, see para 5 above. g) Section III: AITB modifies the standard provisions of ITB. Sufficient guidance is written in the AITB to guide you in filling it. Also, see para 5 above. h) Section V: SCC modifies the standard p rovisions of GCC . Sufficient guidance is written in the SCC to guide you in filling it. Also, see para 5 above. i) There are specific clauses that act like double -edged swords and are appropriate only for restricted procurement situations. Their use in regula r procurement may enhance risk perception (and quoted prices) by the Bidder without any commensurate benefit to the Procuring Entity. These clauses are enabled as dormant and shall not apply unless expressly invoked in the SCC. So , if warranted, explicitly enable these , e.g. in the case of Rate Contract (para 5.7 above), Fall Clause should be expressly invoked. GCC -clause 5.10 (Book Examination clause) : This is too onerous for the Bidder and is rarely used and may be relevant only for an exceptionally high - Guidance Note for the Goods - Model Tender Document [vi] value procurement where undue profiteering is an assessed risk. The Bidder would hedge his prices for the perceived costs and disruptions. GCC -clause 5.12 (Labour Codes and Related Obligations): This usually is not relevant in the procur ement of Goods, except rarely in large Capital Goods procurements, involving a significant presence of contractor's personnel during installation and testing. GCC -clause 6.5 (Quantity Option clause) : This may be useful for repetitive annual/ long -term proc urements, where quantity forecast has large variability. In inappropriate situations, the Bidder may hedge his prices for the uncertainty in quantity. GCC -clause 10.1.6 (Fall clause) : This may be useful in long -term procurements (e.g. Rate -contracts) for g oods procured by many agencies or where prices typically decrease due to technological trends. In inappropriate situations, it may prevent the bidders from passing the benefits of a downward trend of prices in subsequent procurements. j) Section VI: Schedules of Requirements specifies Scope of supplies, Delivery Terms, Delivery Schedule, Logistics requirements. Section VI may be filled to reflect the complete scope of the requirement. The requirements may consist of more than one schedule . Each schedule may co ntain more than one Goods . Description of Goods here should be detailed enough but should leave technical aspects to Section VII: Technical Specifications and Quality Assurance. Pay special attention if incidental works/ services are included, especially i n Capital Goods, Machinery & Plant (Para 5.6 above) . k) Section VII: Technical Specifications & Quality Assurance mentions the technical specifications and quality assurance requirements. Mention here Warranty obligations, Environmental compliance, Energy -saving requirements, e.g., BEE star classification etc., if not covered elsewhere in Tender Documents . Mention type of Inspection, Inspection agency, Tests required etc., if not covered in Technical Specification. l) Section VIII: Qualification Criteria details the qualification criteria distinguished from the eligibility criteria mentioned in NIT -clause 3. Qualification Criteria should be commensurate with t he expertise required to supply Goods to required standards and quality since unduly onerous qualificatio n criteria would restrict competition and lead to higher prices . If the procurement is minor or routine, qualification criteria may be simplified . Guidance is provided in filling this schedule in the Model RfP. Please refer to Annexure 9 (as amended to dat e) of the Manual for Procurement of Goods, 2017, for further guidance. Also mention, I f any , and to what extent dispensation from Qualification Criteria shall be permissible for Start -ups under ITB 4.3.2 -2) and to MII - JVs under ITB 4.1.8 -2. Pay special att ention in the case of Capital Goods, Machinery & Plant and Rate Contracts, where detailed qualification criteria would be required. m) After this, the customisation of the Tender Document is complete.
