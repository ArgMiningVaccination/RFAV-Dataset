The four million objects it holds include costumes, furniture, books,watercolours, metalwork, sculptures and ceramics. They also include thecollections of the National Art Library and the three branch museums that, inaddition to the South Kensington Museum, the V&A administers - the TheatreMuseum, the National Museum of Childhood and the Wellington Museum. In1999-2000, the V&A received grant-in-aid from the Department for Culture,Media and Sport (the Department) amounting to \u00a330 million. /G147The promotion of access for the many, not just for the few /G148 Source: The Government's Comprehensive Spending Review 1998 2 This report looks at the V&A's work to meet its aims of increasing access to, and understanding of, the collections; developing and extending knowledge of thecollections; and sharing its expertise. These aims contribute to theGovernment's aim of extending access in the Culture, Media and Sport sector. 3 Specifically, we examined the V&A's achievements against its targets for broadening access, and how the Museum is responding to the challenge ofbroadening access. The V&A recognises that a key challenge is to improve itsimage: /G147The V&A was perceived as a dusty and old fashioned place, ...... many people had no idea of what it exhibited /G148 Source: a quote from the Chairman of the V&A Trustees as reported in a national newspaper 2execuitve summaryACCESS TO THE VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM The V&A's achievements against its targets for broadening access 4 We looked at how successful the V&A has been in achieving key access-related performance targets set out in its 1997-98, 1998-99 the collections accessible; /G110/G32/G32visitors in educational groups. In examining the V&A's achievements we looked at changes to performance measurement being considered following a sector-wide Efficiency Reviewcommissioned by the Department. Visitors to V&A sites 5 Our analysis of V&A visitor numbers since 1992-93 shows that while numbers increased in the early part of the period, since 1994-95 there has been adownward trend. The V&A's target, over the three years up to and including2001-02, was to achieve a 16 per cent increase in visitors. There were1.27 million visitors to the V&A in 1999-2000 - the first of the three years - butthis was some 320,000 lower than the target and 200,000 (13 per cent) fewerthan in the previous year. The V&A and the Department have agreed to revisethe target which means the V&A is no longer required to achieve an increasein visitor numbers over the period 1999-2002. There are financial implications.Fewer visitors means less visitor income, and less money for new acquisitions(paragraphs 2.2, 2.4 to 2.5 and 2.8 to 2.9). 6 The V&A has not undertaken any detailed work to identify the reasons for the drop in visitor numbers. We found that year on year percentage changes invisitor numbers to the V&A and to a basket of six other national museums andgalleries in London had fluctuated in the period 1993-94 to 1999-2000.However, the percentage reduction experienced by the V&A in 1999-2000 wasparticularly marked. In the first six months of 1999-2000 visitor numbers fell at20 out of 37 leading visitor attractions, both publicly and privately funded, forwhich we obtained data (paragraphs 2.11 to 2.12). Visitor satisfaction levels 7 Over the last three years the South Kensington Museum has achieved visitor satisfaction rates of 96 per cent or higher, but in 1997-98 and 1998-99 fell shortof its 99 per cent target. The lower target of 97 per cent was exceeded in 1999-2000. The Department is currently considering with the V&A and the othernational museums and galleries how measurement of visitor satisfaction can bestrengthened, for example to cover satisfaction with the level of service and toinclude in-depth peer evaluation. We identified some possible technicalenhancements to the measurement of visitor satisfaction that the Departmentcould use in developing guidance for the museums and galleries, for example,making a quantitative assessment of satisfaction by asking visitors to awardpoints out of ten (paragraphs 2.13 to 2.16). 3executive summaryACCESS TO THE VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM Proportion of collections accessible 8 As the V&A defines as accessible any object that is on display or can be viewed by appointment, it regards virtually all of its collections as accessible. However,the Museum does not publicise the nature and availability of those items heldin its reference collections or in store - for the South Kensington Museum, thisrepresents about two thirds of its main collections. Following the EfficiencyReview the Department is considering a new performance measure to providea more meaningful assessment of accessibility - 'the percentage of the V&A'scollections that are on display and accessible to all without having to makespecial appointments' (paragraphs 2.17 to 2.18). Visitors in educational groups 9 As one of the V&A's objectives is to promote lifelong learning, its key access- related performance targets include the number of visitors in bookededucational groups at the South Kensington Museum. Over the last three yearsthe V&A's target has varied between 80,000 and 100,000 visitors in suchgroups. The V&A fell short of the target in 1997-98 but exceeded it in 1998-99and 1999-2000 - the 111,000 visitors in booked education groups last yearrepresented almost 9 per cent of all visitors to the Museum. However, in 1999-2000 the V&A had, following guidance issued by the Department inFebruary 2000, included in its definition for the first time, all visitors ineducational groups not just those in formal education. The target for 1999-2000was not adjusted to reflect this expanded definition of educational visitors(paragraph 2.19). The V&A's performance measurement arrangements 10 A key aim of the sector-wide Efficiency Review (paragraph 4) was to meet the Department's requirements for an agreed basis against which the performanceof government sponsored museums and galleries could be measured. Theresults of the review were published in September 1999 and 22 coreperformance indicators were identified. In February 2000 the Departmentcirculated definitions and guidance for all 22 performance indicators to thenational museums and galleries. The Department now considers that not all22 performance indicators will be appropriate to each of the museums andgalleries, and it has developed a smaller set of core performance indicators andassociated targets for incorporation into the Funding Agreements of individualmuseums and galleries. A selection of indicators and sub-indicators wereincorporated into the Funding Agreement with the V&A from 2000-01. 11 Our examination of the V&A's access-related performance measures - three of which are being retained under the new arrangements - identified someconcerns about scope, definition, measurement and reporting (paragraphs 2.21to 2.28). These include: /G110some measures cover only the South Kensington Museum, not the otherthree V&A sites. The cost of measurement is a factor; /G110although the Committee of Public Accounts has stated that independentvalidation is essential to the credibility of performance reporting, the V&A'sperformance, which is reported to Parliament, is not independentlyvalidated. To obtain assurance for itself, the V&A has asked its internalauditors to validate its performance data; /G110there were inconsistencies in the way targets were set and performancemeasured. For example, in 1998-99 a one-off change in how visitornumbers were calculated meant that the target was achieved whenotherwise it would have been missed.4execuitve summaryACCESS TO THE VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM How the V&A is responding to the challenge of broadening access 12 In promoting access and attracting new visitors, the V&A has to try to meet the sometimes conflicting needs and tastes of its existing and potential visitors.While the V&A has a good understanding of the types of people who currentlyvisit the Museum, and their likes and dislikes, it has yet to undertake anyspecific research amongst non-visitors to find out why they do not visit,although it plans to do so (paragraph 3.4). Projecting the right image 13 The V&A recognises that it has an image problem, and that potential visitors might be put off by its highbrow reputation. However, some visitors,particularly enthusiasts of art and design, see the V&A as a 'highly prestigious'institution. One difficulty is that the V&A's name does not indicate the natureof its collections. The Museum is working with consultants to examine theoptions for increasing 'brand awareness'; is implementing a new marketingplan; and has put in place a programme to encourage younger visitors, attractfirst time visitors and present its collections in new ways (paragraphs 3.6 to 3.8). 14 One way that the V&A plans to strengthen its image is through improvements to the fabric of the South Kensington Museum. The Museum has embarked ona major project, costing \u00a331 million, to redevelop the British Galleries. Theproject, which covers some ten per cent of the gallery space at the SouthKensington Museum, is due to be completed in late 2001 and is seen as the firstmajor step to revitalise the Museum. In the longer term, another project - theSpiral (see photograph opposite) - is designed to give the outward appearanceof the Museum a more contemporary look. As well as providing acontemporary exterior, the Spiral will give the Museum a new entrance and willbe the centre for contemporary art and culture. This project is scheduled to becompleted by 2005, at the earliest, at an estimated cost of \u00a380 million(paragraph 3.12). Making objects accessible 15 To make its collections accessible in the most literal sense, the V&A has been experimenting with longer opening hours. But one of the challenges the V&Afaces is presenting its collections in ways which are appropriate, whileappealing to a broad range of visitors with different tastes and requirements,and within financial constraints. Some visitors like what they see as an 'oldschool' and 'purist' approach. Others find the displays tired and old fashioned,and would like greater use of interactive technology, though in a subtle way.The V&A has set up a 'test bed' for the new display and presentation techniquesit proposes to adopt in the new British Galleries, and visitor reaction has beenpositive (paragraphs 3.14 to 3.15 and 3.18 to 3.22). 5executive summaryACCESS TO THE VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM Targeting different types of visitors 16 The V&A runs specific activities which are designed to increase the number and range of visitors as well as meeting the needs of its existing audience. Anexample is the Shamiana project, the aim of which was to encourage womenand children of South Asian origin in Britain to explore their cultural heritagethrough the V&A's Indian collection. The project was identified as an exampleof good practice in the Department's Efficiency Review. More generally, theV&A was identified as following good practice in introducing new approachesto learning (paragraphs 3.30 to 3.31 and 3.39 to 3.40). 17 In a typical year, the V&A stages two or three major exhibitions, and visitor numbers tend to increase by more than 20 per cent during these periods. Butthe exhibitions are not just about attracting large numbers of visitors. The V&Aaims to provide a mixed diet aimed at different audiences. Some are designedto have mass appeal and others to be of more specialist interest. The Museumalso targets exhibitions on particular communities, for example 'The Arts of theSikh Kingdoms'. The V&A recognised that while this exhibition might not havea mass appeal, it was contributing to the aim of broadening the range of visitors(paragraphs 3.32 to 3.34). 18 The V&A has difficulty attracting children and families - in 1999 just 14 per cent of visitors were under the age of 18. The Museum has developed a FamilyProgramme to encourage children and families to visit, but while the activitiesare popular awareness of the Programme is low (paragraphs 3.35 to 3.38). Embracing the electronic age 19 The Internet provides a powerful opportunity for museums and galleries to increase public access through remote connections to their collections andexpertise. The V&A website (http://www.vam.ac.uk) was first launched in 1995and was updated in 1999. The current website has received a number ofawards, but the V&A recognises the need for continuing development. Ourreview pointed to scope to improve the links to other websites, and there aregaps in the information provided - for example there is no information on theV&A's programme of courses. One aim of the website is to encourage users tovisit the Museum, but a survey of visitors in December 1999 showed that onlytwo per cent had been influenced by the website (paragraphs 3.41 to 3.44).6execuitve summaryACCESS TO THE VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM 20 The V&A is doing much to broaden access to its collections. It is working to create a more positive and clearer image, and uses its special exhibitions and visitorprogrammes to achieve wider appeal and provide quality learning opportunities.It is also taking action to make the Museum a more visitor-friendly place. But thereis still much to do to improve public understanding of the nature of the V&A'scollections, and improve the way they are presented. While work is in hand to dothis, the V&A has to grapple with the diverse and sometimes conflicting needs andtastes of the visitors it is seeking to attract. The need to do so is clear. While theV&A's aim was to achieve a 16 per cent increase in visitor numbers over the threeyears up to and including 2001-02, the reality is that its numbers have been on thedecline since the early 1990s and took a sharp fall in 1999-2000. The V&A andthe Department have agreed to revise the visitor numbers targets for 2000-01 and 2000-02 to the level achieved (1.5 million) in 1998-99. 21 In the light of our examination our main recommendations are: The V&A should : i undertake a thorough analysis of the reasons for the continuing reduction in its visitor numbers and, in particular, the sharp fall in 1999-2000; iipress ahead with plans to carry out research among non-visitors to find out why they do not visit. The V&A's plans for increasing 'brand awareness' andtackling its image problem are important in this regard; iiigive particular attention to stimulating public awareness of its two major projects - the British Galleries and the Spiral. The Museum is setting great storeby these projects and effective marketing will be crucial if they are to have thedesired effect in raising the Museum's profile and drawing in new visitors; ivbe alert to the possibility that other parts of the Museum could suffer from the contrast with the modernised British Galleries. The Museum will need aclear plan for dealing with this, and for applying (within resourceconstraints) to its other galleries the lessons from its research into the BritishGalleries, for example on new display techniques; vimprove communication about the activities it offers. Implementing the ten- point marketing plan should help, and there may be scope to make moreuse of its website to encourage visits. There are good things going on at theV&A that not enough people know about.Conclusions and recommendations7executive summaryACCESS TO THE VICTORIA AND ALBERT MUSEUM The Department should : vipush forward with the further work it recognises needs to be undertaken on some of the 22 core performance indicators produced by the EfficiencyReview and, where appropriate, incorporate these into the FundingAgreements of the individual national museums and galleries; viiwork with the individual national museums and galleries to ensure that the new performance indicators are underpinned by good quality performancedata and accurate, reliable and informative performance reporting.
