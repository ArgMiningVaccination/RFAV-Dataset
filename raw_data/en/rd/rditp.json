Latessa, University of Cincinnati Francis T. Cullen, University of Cincinnati Paul Gendreau, University of New Brunswick at Saint John LONG-TIME VIEWERS of Saturday Night Live will vividly recall Steve Martin's hilarious portrayal of a medieval medical practitioner\u2014the English barber, Theodoricof York. When ill patients are brought be- fore him, he prescribes ludicrous \"cures,\" such as repeated bloodletting, the applica-tion of leeches and boar's vomit, gory am- putations, and burying people up to their necks in a marsh. At a point in the skit whena patient dies and Theodoric is accused of \"not knowing what he is doing,\" Martin stops, apparently struck by the transform-ing insight that medicine might abandon harmful interventions rooted in ignorant customs and follow a more enlightened path.\"Perhaps,\" he says, \"I've been wrong to blindly follow the medical traditions and superstitions of past centuries.\" He then pro-ceeds to wonder whether he should \"test these assumptions analytically through ex- perimentation and the scientific method.\"And perhaps, he says, the scientific method might be applied to other fields of learning. He might even be able to \"lead the way to anew age\u2014an age of rebirth, a renaissance.\" He then pauses and gives the much-awaited and amusing punchline, \"Nawwwwwww!\" The humor, of course, lies in the juxtapo- sition and final embrace of blatant quackery with the possibility and rejection of a moremodern, scientific, and ultimately effective approach to medicine. For those of us who make a living commenting on or doing cor-rections, however, we must consider whether, in a sense, the joke is on us. We can readily see the humor in Steve Martin's skit and won-der how those in medieval societies \"could have been so stupid.\" But even a cursory sur-vey of current correctional practices yields the disquieting conclusion that we are a field in which quackery is tolerated, if not implicitly celebrated. It is not clear whether most of ushave ever had that reflective moment in which we question whether, \"just maybe,\" there might be a more enlightened path to pursue.If we have paused to envision a different way of doing things, it is apparent that our reac- tion, after a moment's contemplation, toooften has been, \"Nawwwwwwww!\" This appraisal might seem overly harsh, but we are persuaded that it is truthful.When intervening in the lives of offenders\u2014 that is, intervening with the expressed inten- tion of reducing recidivism\u2014corrections hasresisted becoming a true \"profession.\" Too often, being a \"professional\" has been de- based to mean dressing in a presentable way,having experience in the field, and showing up every day for work. But a profession is defined not by its surface appearance but byits intellectual core. An occupation may lay claim to being a \"profession\" only to the extent that its practices are based on researchknowledge, training, and expertise\u2014a tri- umvirate that promotes the possibility that what it does can be effective (Cullen, 1978;Starr, 1982). Thus, medicine's professionalization cannot be separated from its embrace of scientific knowledge asthe ideal arbiter of how patients should be treated (Starr, 1982). The very concept of \"malpractice\" connotes that standards ofservice delivery have been established, are universally transmitted, and are capable of distinguishing acceptable from unacceptableinterventions. The concept of liability for \"correctional malpractice\" would bringsnickers from the crowd\u2014a case where hu- mor unintentionally offers a damning indict- ment of the field's standards of care. In contrast to professionalism, quackery is dismissive of scientific knowledge, training, and expertise. Its posture is strikingly over- confident, if not arrogant. It embraces thenotion that interventions are best rooted in \"common sense,\" in personal experiences (or clinical knowledge), in tradition, and in su-perstition (Gendreau, Goggin, Cullen, and Paparozzi, forthcoming). \"What to be \"obvious,\" derived only fromyears of an individual's experience, and legiti- mized by an appeal to custom (\"the way we have always done things around here hasworked just fine\"). It celebrates being anti- intellectual. There is never a need to visit a library or consult a study. Correctional quackery , therefore, is the use of treatment interventions that are based on neither 1) existing knowledge of the causesof crime nor 2) existing knowledge of what programs have been shown to change of- fender behavior (Cullen and Gendreau, 2000;Gendreau, 2000). The hallmark of correc- tional quackery is thus ignorance. Such igno- rance about crime and its cures at times is\"understandable\"\u2014that is, linked not to the willful rejection of research but to being in a field in which professionalism is not expectedor supported. At other times, however, quack- ery is proudly displayed, as its advocates boldly proclaim that they have nothing tolearn from research conducted by academics \"who have never worked with a criminal\" (a claim that is partially true but ultimatelybeside the point and a rationalization for continued ignorance).44 FEDERAL PROBATION Volume 66 Number 2 Need we now point out the numerous pro- grams that have been implemented with much fanfare and with amazing promises of success, only later to turn out to have \"noeffect\" on reoffending? \"Boot camps,\" of course, are just one recent and salient example. Based on a vague, if not unstated,theory of crime and an absurd theory of be- havioral change (\"offenders need to be bro- ken down\"\u2014through a good deal ofhumiliation and threats\u2014and then \"built back up\"), boot camps could not possibly have \"worked.\" In fact, we know of no majorpsychological theory that would logically sug- gest that such humiliation or threats are com- ponents of effective therapeutic interventions(Gendreau et al., forthcoming). Even so, boot camps were put into place across the nation without a sh red of empirical evidence as to their effectiveness, and only now has their ap- peal been tarnished after years of negative evaluation studies (Cullen, Pratt, MacKenzie, Wilson, Kider, 2001).How many millions of dollars have been squandered? How many opportunities to re- habilitate offenders have been forfeited? Howmany citizens have been needlessly victimized by boot camp graduates? What has been the cost to society of this quackery? We are not alone in suggesting that ad- vances in our field will be contingent on the conscious rejection of quackery in favor of anevidence-based corrections (Cullen and Gendreau, 2000; MacKenzie, 2000; Welsh and 2001). Moving beyond correc-tional quackery when intervening with offend- ers, however, will be a daunting challenge. It will involve overcoming four central failuresnow commonplace in correctional treatment. We review these four sources of correctional quackery not simply to show what is lackingin the field but also in hopes of illuminating what a truly professional approach to correc- tions must strive to entail. Four Sources of Correctional Quackery Failure to Use Research in Designing Programs Every correctional agency must decide \"what to do\" with the offenders under its supervi-sion, including selecting which \"programs\" or \"interventions\" their charges will be sub- jected to. But how is this choice made (achoice that is consequential to the offender,the agency, and the community)? Often, no real choice is made, because agencies simply continue with the practices that have been inherited from previous administrations.Other times, programs are added incremen- tally, such as when concern rises about drug use or drunk driving. And still other times\u2014such as when punishment-oriented interme- diate sanctions were the fad from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s\u2014jurisdictionscopy the much-publicized interventions be- ing implemented elsewhere in the state and in the nation.Notice, however, what is missing in this account: The failure to consider the existing research on program effectiveness. The risk of quackery rises to the level of virtual cer-tainty when nobody in the agency asks, \"Is there any evidence supporting what we are intending to do?\" The irrationality of not con-sulting the existing research is seen when we consider again, medicine. Imagine if local physicians and hospitals made no effort toconsult \"what works\" and simply prescribed pharmaceuticals and conducted surgeries based on custom or the latest fad. Such mal-practice would be greeted with public con- demnation, lawsuits, and a loss of legitimacy by the field of medicine. It is fair to ask whether research can, in fact, direct us to more effective correctional inter- ventions. Two decades ago, our knowledge wasmuch less developed. But the science of crime and treatment has made important strides in the intervening years. In particular, researchhas illuminated three bodies of knowledge that are integral to designing effective interventions. First, we have made increasing strides in determining the empirically established or known predictors of offender include, most importantly: 1) antiso-cial values, 2) antisocial peers, 3) poor self- control, self-management, and prosocial problem-solving skills, 4) family dysfunction,and 5) past criminality. This information is critical, because interventions that ignore these factors are doomed to fail. Phrased alterna-tively, successful programs start by recogniz- ing what causes crime and then specifically design the intervention to target these factors forchange (Alexander, Pugh, and Parsons, and Gendreau, 2000; Henggeler et al., 1998). Consider, however, the kinds of \"theories\" about the causes of crime that underlie many correctional interventions. In many cases,simple ignorance prevails; those working in correctional agencies cannot explain what crime-producing factors the program is alleg-edly targeting for change. Still worse, many programs have literally invented seemingly ludicrous theories of crime that are put for-ward with a straight face. From our collective experiences, we have listed in Table 1 crime theories that either 1) were implicit in pro-grams we observed or 2) were voiced by agency personnel when asked what crime- causing factors their programs were target-TABLE 1 Questionable Theories of Crime We Have Encountered in Agency Programs /H12012\"Been there, done that\" theory. /H12012\"Offenders lack creativity\" theory. /H12012\"Offenders need to get back to nature\" theory. /H12012\"It worked for me\" theory. /H12012\"Offenders lack discipline\" /H12012\"Offenders organizational skills\" theory. /H12012\"Offenders have low self-esteem\" theory. /H12012\"We just want them to be happy\" theory. /H12012The \"treat offenders as babies and dress them in diapers\" theory. /H12012\"Offenders need to have a pet in prison\" theory. /H12012\"Offenders need acupuncture\" theory. /H12012\"Offenders need to have healing lodges\" theory. /H12012\"Offenders need drama therapy\" theory. /H12012\"Offenders need a better diet and haircut\" theory. /H12012\"Offenders (females) need to learn how to put on makeup and dress better\" theory. /H12012\"Offenders (males) need to get in touch with their feminine side\" theory.September 2002 BEYOND CORRECTIONAL QUACKERY 45 ing. These \"theories\" would be amusing ex- cept that they are commonplace and, again, potentially lead to correctional quackery. For example, the theory of \"offenders (males)need to get in touch with their feminine side\" prompted one agency to have offenders dress in female clothes. We cannot resist the temp-tation to note that you will now know whom to blame if you are mugged by a cross-dresser! But, in the end, this is no laughing matter.This intervention has no chance to be effec- tive, and thus an important chance was for- feited to improve offenders' lives and toprotect public safety. Second, there is now a growing literature that outlines what does not work in offender treatment (see, e.g., Cullen, 2002; Cullen and These include boot camps, punish- ment-oriented programs (e.g., \"scaredstraight\" programs), control-oriented pro- grams (e.g., intensive supervision programs), wilderness programs, psychological interven-tions that are non-directive or insight-oriented (e.g., psychoanalytic), and non-intervention (as suggested by labeling theory). Ineffectiveprograms also target for treatment low-risk offenders and target for change weak predic- tors of criminal behavior (e.g., self-esteem).Given this knowledge, it would be a form of quackery to continue to use or to freshly imple- ment these types of interventions. Third, conversely, there is now a growing literature that outlines what does work in of- fender treatment (Cullen, 2002; Cullen andGendreau, 2000). Most importantly, efforts are being made to develop principles of ef- fective intervention (Andrews, 1995; Andrewsand Bonta, 1998; Gendreau, 1996). These principles are listed in Table 2. Programs that adhere to these principles have been foundto achieve meaningful reductions in recidi- vism (Andrews, Cullen, 2002). However, programs that are designed with- out consulting these principles are almost cer-tain to have little or no impact on offender recidivism and may even risk increasing re- offending. That is, if these principles are ig-nored, quackery is likely to result. We will return to this issue below.TABLE 2 Eight Principles of Effective Correctional Intervention 1. Organizational Culture Effective organizations have well-defined goals, ethical principles, and a history of efficiently responding to issues that have an impact on the treatment facilities. Staff cohesion, support for service training, self-evaluation, and use of outside resources also characterize the organization. 2. Program Implementation/MaintenancePrograms are based on empirically-defined needs and are consistent with the organization's values. The program is fiscally responsible and congruent with stakeholders' values. Effective programs also are based on thorough reviews of the literature (i.e., meta-analyses), undergo pilot trials, and maintain the staff's professional credentials. 3. Management/Staff CharacteristicsThe program director and treatment staff are professionally trained and have previous experience working in offender treatment programs. Staff selection is based on their holding beliefs supportive of rehabilitation and relationship styles and therapeutic skill factors typical of effective therapies. 4. Client Risk/Need Practices Offender risk is assessed by psychometric instruments of proven predictivevalidity. The risk instrument consists of a wide range of dynamic risk factors or criminogenic needs (e.g., anti-social attitudes and values). The assessment also takes into account the responsivity of offenders to different styles and modes of service. Changes in risk level over time (e.g., 3 to 6 months) are routinely as- sessed in order to measure intermediate changes in risk/need levels that mayoccur as a result of planned interventions. 5. Program Characteristics The program targets for change a wide variety of criminogenic needs (factors that predict recidivism), using empirically valid behavioral/social learning/ cognitive behavioral therapies that are directed to higher-risk offenders. The ratio of rewards to punishers is at least 4:1. Relapse prevention strategies are availableonce offenders complete the formal treatment phase. 6. Core Correctional Practice Program therapists engage in the following therapeutic practices: anti-criminal modeling, effective reinforcement and disapproval, problem-solving techniques, structured learning procedures for skill-building, effective use of authority, cognitive self-change, relationship practices, and motivational interviewing. 7. Inter-Agency CommunicationThe agency aggressively makes referrals and advocates for its offenders in order that they receive high quality services in the community. 8. Evaluation The agency routinely conducts program audits, consumer satisfaction surveys, process evaluations of changes in criminogenic need, and follow-ups of recidi- vism rates. The effectiveness of the program is evaluated by comparing therespective recidivism rates of risk-control comparison groups of other treatments or those of a minimal treatment group. Note: Items adapted from the Correctional Program Assessment Inventory\u20142000 , a 131-item Questionnaire that is widely used in assessing the quality of correctional treatment programs (Gendreau and Andrews, 2001).46 FEDERAL PROBATION Volume 66 Number 2 Failure to Follow Appropriate Assess- ment and Classification Practices The steady flow of offenders into correctional agencies not only strains resources but also creates a continuing need to allocate treat-ment resources efficaciously. This problem is not dissimilar to a hospital that must process a steady flow of patients. In a hospital (ordoctor's office), however, it is immediately recognized that the crucial first step to deliv- ering effective treatment is diagnosing or as- sessing the patient's condition and its severity. In the absence of such a diagnosis\u2014which might involve the careful study of symptomsor a battery of tests\u2014the treatment pre- scribed would have no clear foundation. Medicine would be a lottery in which the illwould hope the doctor assigned the right treatment. In a similar way, effective treat- ment intervention requires the appropriateassessment of both the risks posed by, and the needs underlying the criminality of, offend- ers. When such diagnosis is absent and noclassification of offenders is possible, offend- ers in effect enter a treatment lottery in which their access to effective intervention is achancy proposition. Strides have been made to develop more effective classification instruments\u2014such asthe Level of Supervision Inventory (LSI) (Bonta, 1996), which, among its competitors, has achieved the highest predictive validitywith recidivism (Gendreau et al., 1996). The LSI and similar instruments classify offend- ers by using a combination of \"static\" factors(such as criminal history) and \"dynamic fac- tors\" (such as antisocial values, peer associa- tions) shown by previous research to predictrecidivism. In this way, it is possible to clas- sify offenders by their level of risk and to dis- cern the types and amount of \"criminogenicneeds\" they possess that should be targetedfor change in their correctional treatment. At present, however, there are three prob- lems with offender assessment and classifica-tion by correctional agencies (Gendreau and Goggin, 1997). First, many agencies simply do not assess offenders, with many claimingthey do not have the time. Second, when agencies do assess, they assess poorly. Thus, they often use outdated, poorly designed, and/or empirically unvalidated classification in- struments. In particular, they tend to rely on instruments that measure exclusively staticpredictors of recidivism (which cannot, by definition, be changed) and that provide no information on the criminogenic needs thatoffenders have. If these \"needs\" are not iden-tified and addressed\u2014such as possessing an- tisocial values\u2014the prospects for recidivism will be high. For example, a study of 240 (161 adult and 79 juvenile) programs assessedacross 30 states found that 64 percent of the programs did not utilize a standardized and objective assessment tool that could distin-guish risk/needs levels for offenders (Matthews, Hubbard, and Latessa, 2001; Latessa, 2002). Third, even when offenders are assessed using appropriate classification instruments, agencies frequently ignore the information.It is not uncommon, for example, for offend- ers to be assessed and then for everyone to be given the same treatment. In this instance,assessment becomes an organizational rou- tine in which paperwork is compiled but the information is ignored. Again, these practices increase the likeli- hood that offenders will experience correc- tional quackery. In a way, treatment isdelivered blindly, with agency personnel equipped with little knowledge about the risks and needs of the offenders under their super-vision. In these circumstances, it is impossible to know which offenders should receive which interventions. Any hopes of individualizinginterventions effectively also are forfeited, be- cause the appropriate diagnosis either is un- available or hidden in the agency's unused files. Failure to Use Effective Treatment Models Once offenders are assessed, the next step is to select an appropriate treatment model. Aswe have suggested, the challenge is to consult the empirical literature on \"what works,\" and to do so with an eye toward programs thatconform to the principles of effective inter- vention. At this stage, it is inexcusable either to ignore this research or to implement pro-grams that have been shown to be ineffective. Yet, as we have argued, the neglect of the ex- isting research on effective treatment modelsis widespread. In the study of 240 programs noted above, it was reported that two-thirds of adult programs and over half of juvenileprograms did not use a treatment model that research had shown to be effective (Matthews et al., 2001; Latessa, 2002). Another study\u2014ameta-analysis of 230 program evaluations (which yielded 374 tests or effect sizes)\u2014cat- egorized the extent to which interventionsconformed to the principles of effective in- tervention. In only 13 percent of the tests were the interventions judged to fall into the \"mostappropriate\" category (Andrews et al., 1999). But this failure to employ an appropriate treat- ment approach does not have to be the case. Why would an agency\u2014in this informationage\u2014risk quackery when the possibility of us- ing an evidence-based program exists? Why not select effective treatment models? Moving in this direction is perhaps mostly a matter of a change of consciousness\u2014that is, an awareness by agency personnel thatquackery must be rejected and programs with a track record of demonstrated success em- braced. Fortunately, depending on the of-fender population, there is a growing number of treatment models that might be learned and implemented (Cullen and Applegate,1997). Some of the more prominent models in this regard are the \"Functional Family Therapy\" model that promotes family cohe-sion and affection (Alexander et al., 1998; Gordon, Graves, and Arbuthnot, 1995), the teaching youths to think and react responsi-bly peer-helping (\"Equip\") program (Gibbs, Potter, and Curriculum\" program (Goldstein, 1999),\"Multisystemic Therapy\" grated Service Delivery Model\" that targetscriminal thinking, anger, and substance abuse (see Gendreau, Smith, and Goggin, 2001). Failure to Evaluate What We Do Quackery has long prevailed in corrections because agencies have traditionally required nosystematic evaluation of the effectiveness of their programs (Gendreau, Goggin, and Smith, 2001). Let us admit that many agencies maynot have the human or financial capital to con- duct ongoing evaluations. Nonetheless, it is not clear that the failure to evaluate has been dueto a lack of capacity as much as to a lack of desire. The risk inherent in evaluation, of course, is that practices that are now unques-tioned and convenient may be revealed as in- effective. Evaluation, that is, creates accountability and the commitment threat ofhaving to change what is now being done. The cost of change is not to be discounted, but so too is the \"high cost of ignoring success\" (VanVoorhis, 1987). In the end, a professional must be committed to doing not simply what is in one's self-interest but what is ethical and ef-fective. To scuttle attempts at program evalu- ation and to persist in using failed interventions is wrong and a key ingredient to continuedcorrectional quackery (more broadly, see Van Voorhis, Cullen, and Applegate, 1995).September 2002 BEYOND CORRECTIONAL QUACKERY 47 Evaluation, moreover, is not an all-or- nothing procedure. Ideally, agencies would conduct experimental studies in which of- fenders were randomly assigned to a treat-ment or control group and outcomes, such as recidivism, were measured over a lengthy period of time. But let us assume that, in manysettings, conducting this kind of sophisticated evaluation is not feasible. It is possible, how- ever, for virtually all agencies to monitor, toa greater or lesser extent, the quality of the programs that they or outside vendors are supplying. Such evaluative monitoring wouldinvolve, for example, assessing whether treat- ment services are being delivered as designed, supervising and giving constructive feedbackto treatment staff, and studying whether of- fenders in the program are making progress on targeted criminogenic factors (e.g., chang-ing antisocial attitudes, manifesting more prosocial behavior). In too many cases, of- fenders are \"dropped off\" in intervention pro-grams and then, eight or twelve weeks later, are deemed\u2014without any basis for this con- clusion\u2014to have \"received treatment.\" Imag-ine if medical patients entered and exited hospitals with no one monitoring their treat- ment or physical recovery. Again, we knowwhat we could call such practices. Conclusion\u2014Becoming an Evidence-Based Profession In assigning the label \"quackery\" to much of what is now being done in corrections, we run the risk of seeming, if not being, preachy and pretentious. This is not our intent. If anything,we mean to be provocative\u2014not for the sake of causing a stir, but for the purpose of prompt- ing correctional leaders and professionals tostop using treatments that cannot possibly be effective. If we make readers think seriously about how to avoid selecting, designing, andusing failed correctional interventions, our ef- forts will have been worthwhile. We would be remiss, however, if we did not confess that academic criminologists share the blame for the continued use of in- effective programs. For much of the pastquarter century, most academic criminolo- gists have abandoned correctional practitio- ners. Although some notable exceptions exist,we have spent much of our time claiming that \"nothing works\" in offender rehabilitation and have not created partnerships with thosein corrections so as to build knowledge on \"what works\" to change offenders (Cullen and Gendreau, 2001). Frequently, what guidance criminologists have offered correctional agen-cies has constituted bad advice\u2014ideologically inspired, not rooted in the research, and likely to foster quackery. Fortunately, there is agrowing movement among criminologists to do our part both in discerning the principles of effective intervention and in decipheringwhat interventions have empirical support (Cullen and Gendreau, 2001; MacKenzie, 2000; Welsh and Farrington, the field of corrections has more infor- mation available to find out what our \"best bets\" are when intervening with offenders(Rhine, 1998). We must also admit that our use of medi- cine as a comparison to corrections has beenoverly simplistic. We stand firmly behind the central message conveyed\u2014that what is done in corrections would be grounds for malprac-tice in medicine\u2014but we have glossed over the challenges that the field of medicine faces in its attempt to provide scientifically-basedinterventions. First, scientific knowledge is not static but evolving. Medical treatments that appear to work now may, after years ofstudy, prove ineffective or less effective than alternative interventions. Second, even when information is available, it is not clear that itis effectively transmitted or that doctors, who may believe in their personal \"clinical expe- rience,\" will be open to revising their treat-ment strategies (Hunt, 1997). \"The gap between research and knowledge,\" notes Millenson (1997, p. 4), \"has real conse-quences....when family practitioners in Washington State were queried about treat- ing a simple urinary tract infection in women,eighty-two physicians came up with an ex- traordinary 137 different strategies.\" In re- sponse to situations like these, there is arenewed evidence-based movement in medi- cine to treat- ments (Millenson, 1997; Timmermans andAngell, 2001). Were corrections to reject quackery in fa- vor of an evidence-based approach, it is likelythat agencies would face the same difficulties that medicine encounters in trying base treat- ments on the best scientific knowledge avail-able. Designing and implementing an effective program is more complicated, we re-alize, than simply visiting a library in search of research on program effectiveness (al- though this is often an important first step). Information must be available in a form thatcan be used by agencies. As in medicine, there must be opportunities for training and the provision of manuals that can be consultedin how specifically to carry out an interven- tion. Much attention has to be paid to imple- menting programs as they are designed. And,in the long run, an effort must be made to support widespread program evaluation and to use the resulting data both to improve in-dividual programs and to expand our knowl- edge base on effective programs generally. To move beyond quackery and accomplish these goals, the field of corrections will have to take seriously what it means to be a profes- sion. In this context, individual agencies and individuals within agencies would do well to strive to achieve what Gendreau et al. (forth- coming) refer to as the \"3 C's\" of effectivecorrectional policies: First, employ creden- tialed people ; second, ensure that the agency is credentialed in that it is founded on the prin- ciples of fairness and the improvement of lives through ethically defensive means; and third, base treatment decisions on credentialed knowledge (e.g., research from meta-analyses). By themselves, however, given individu- als and agencies can do only so much toimplement effective interventions\u2014although each small step away from quackery and to- ward an evidence-based practice potentiallymakes a meaningful difference. The broader issue is whether the field of corrections will embrace the principles that all interventionsshould be based on the best research evidence, that all practitioners must be sufficiently trained so as to develop expertise in how toachieve offender change, and that an ethical corrections cannot tolerate treatments known to be foolish, if not harmful. In the end, cor-rectional quackery is not an inevitable state of affairs\u2014something we are saddled with for the foreseeable future. Rather, although a for-midable foe, it is ultimately rooted in our col- lective decision to tolerate ignorance and failure. Choosing a different future for cor-rections\u2014making the field a true profes- sion\u2014will be a daunting challenge, but it is a future that lies within our power to achieve.48 FEDERAL PROBATION Volume 66 Number 2 References Alexander, James, Christie Pugh, and Bruce Par- sons.1998.
