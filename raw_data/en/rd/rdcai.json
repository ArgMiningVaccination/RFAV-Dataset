Consequently, many patients express skepticism and mistrust of vaccines. It is important that future clinicians are well equipped to understand vaccine-related literature to prepare them for difficult conversations with patients. This module incorporated various active learning approaches to evaluate vaccine-related literature, discuss true contraindications for vaccination, and aid students in approaching patient-clinician conversations about vaccines. Data gained from delivery of this module suggests that students benefit from gaining knowledge and cultivating communication skills about vaccines early in health professions education.
