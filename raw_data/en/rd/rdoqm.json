Today, I did just that. My day of birth was Friday, 6/18. I've been noticing the numbers \"618\" several times a day for the past few months, starting at the mental health facility. A few days before I began my 33rd lap around the sun, I checked the weather forecast and journaled these words. \"I can't wait for the rain to come...so I can let my tears fall. Though my heart may race and I might want to run, I need to breathe out what no longer serves me, wash it away\u2014all that I've gathered and held onto. I need to release the hold of welled-up clouds with my Mama, nature...to cleanse my energy. Even if I last only a moment, I feel called to reconnect. Bring on the rain.\" A week later, I sat on my couch in tears. This was not the first time I had cried, today. It's been an emotional week. Hell, it's been an [emotional life](https://www.elephantjournal.com/2021/04/7-ways-to-stop-our-fear-of-abandonment-from-turning-us-into-emotional-vampires-giselle-naidu/). But during this moment, I had just been on the receiving end of my teenage daughter's pent-up pain, which always cuts me deeply. She had just stormed out of the house. I saw that it was sprinkling and I thought, \"Let her go. She needs it, to let the rain wash her pain away.\" I sat here breathing through my feelings, wiping down my remotes with antibacterial wipes, cleaning off the coffee table, feeling, and processing. I noticed the rain started coming down a little bit harder. When I looked through my window, it was as if I had heard mother nature whisper, \"I'm crying, too. Come cry with me.\" Normally, I carry my purse with me everywhere I go. It has everything I need to calm myself in it. I'm a neurotic [agoraphobic](https://www.elephantjournal.com/2020/07/living-in-a-covid-world-as-an-agoraphobic-with-cptsd/) so what happened next was huge for me. I went outside and I walked further than the doorway, without the sensation of chains attached to my ankles. Without the racing heart, dizziness, or blurred vision. I felt the warm wet cement on my feet. I stared at my tree and watched the rain fall between us. I closed my eyes, put my arms in the air, took a deep breath in, and let another tear out. Mother nature and I felt as one. I walked back inside and smiled to myself as I resumed my usual seat on the couch. A few moments later, the sun peeked out, and my daughter joined me. It wasn't a long enough rain to wash it all away, but it was enough to remind me that this is all natural. ~ "}
