While certain pharmacologic strategies can temper theadverse effects of irradiation, stem cell therapies provide unique opportunities for restoring functionality to theirradiated tissue bed. Recent Advances: Preclinical studies presented in this review provide encouraging proof of concept regarding the therapeutic potential of stem cells for treating the adverse side effects associated with radiotherapy in different organs. Early-stage clinical data for radiation-induced lung, bone, and skin compli-cations are promising and highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate stem cell type to stimulate tissueregeneration. Critical Issues: While therapeutic efcacy has been demonstrated in a variety of animal models and human trials, a range of additional concerns regarding stem cell transplantation for ameliorating radiation-induced normal tissue sequelae remain. Safety issues regarding teratoma formation, disease progression, andgenomic stability along with technical issues impacting disease targeting, immunorejection, and clinical scale-upare factors bearing on the eventual translation of stem cell therapies into routine clinical practice. Future Directions: Follow-up studies will need to identify the best possible stem cell types for the treatment of early and late radiation-induced normal tissue injury. Additional work should seek to optimize cellular dosing regimes,identify the best routes of administration, elucidate optimal transplantation windows for introducing cells intomore receptive host tissues, and improve immune tolerance for longer-term engrafted cell survival into theirradiated microenvironment.

Introduction Targeted radiotherapy is an effective treatment for cancer, but the amount of curative radiation that can be delivered to the tumor is limited by the sensitivity of normaltissues surrounding the lesion. While cancer therapies in-creasingly achieve cure and extend survival, they often result in chronic side effects in patients (29, 99, 142, 148, 149). Paradoxically, modern therapies threaten to increase theburden of chronic toxicity, not reduce it (6). Acute reactions impacting normal tissue injury early after treatment are re-lated to oxidative stress and inflammation that alter the mi- croenvironment which includes sensitive stem cell niches (78). These changes prime the irradiated tissue bed for a wide-range of multifaceted late effects. Recent research has identied a wealth of pharmacologic strategies to temper the adverse effects of radiation exposure (23, 163). Although pharmacologic interventions have only 1Laboratory of Radiopathology and 3Departments of Radiation Oncology and Cell Biology, University Medical Center of Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands. 4Monteore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York. 5Inserm U 791, Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Centre for Osteoarticular and Dental Tissue Engineering (LIOAD), Nantes University Hospital, Nantes, France. 6Division of Biological Stress Response, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 7Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California.ANTIOXIDANTS & REDOX SIGNALING Volume 21, Number 2, 2014 \u00aaMary Ann Liebert, Inc. DOI: 10.1089/ars.2013.5652 338 limited ability to mitigate severe side effects of radiotherapy, some studies have shown the potential of these treatments to inhibit the onset of tissue damage (163). While certain phar- macologic approaches are benecial, none offer the potentialof stem cell-based strategies, which afford the opportunity to functionally replace cells lost or damaged during irradiation. The use of stem cell therapy to promote recovery of normaltissues exposed to ionizing radiation aims at ameliorating the unintended side effects due to normal tissue damage. With the exception of bone marrow transplants, used for manyyears to reconstitute the hematopoietic compartment afterablative irradiation (83), the application of stem cell therapies for reducing other normal tissue sequelae remains a new but burgeoning area of research. The potential benets of stem cell therapy are certainly not limited to cell replacement, as signicant evidence exists, showing that engrafted cells provide trophic support to thesurrounding host tissue (123, 172, 196, 198). Regardless of the mechanism, protecting and/or restoring endogenous cell function will reduce normal tissue injury and hasten therecovery of patients who are subjected to irradiation.Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were originally proposed for therapeutic purposes in regenerative medicine, based on their multipotent, proliferative, and anti-inflammatory properties.However, in recent years, therapeutic strategies are now evolving in which other stem/progenitor cell types are used alone or in co-transplantation with endothelial or epithelialprogenitors to hasten the recovery and reconstitution of nor- mal tissue. The identication of stem cell populations and the capa- bility to isolate and expand them for therapeutic uses has stimulated a wealth of research into regenerating injured tis- sue. Despite this promise, the past decade has also shown thattranslating the potential of stem cell therapy into actualpractice is not easy, and many barriers, including im- munorejection (22, 129), teratogenesis (106), regulatory (107) and ethical issues (46), still need to be overcome before suchstrategies become commonplace in the clinic. Thus, discus- sions of therapeutic efcacy to restore functionality to irradi- ated tissues are provided along with the caveats associatedwith such treatments. The present review will highlight recent advances in the application of various stem cell-based strat- egies to ameliorate radiation-induced normal tissue damageoccurring within selected target organ sites. Stem Cell Therapy to Ameliorate Radiation-Induced Cognitive Impairment Worldwide, *240,000 patients are diagnosed with brain tumors per year. Delayed adverse cognitive effects can occurin approximately 50% of irradiated patients, depending on radiation dose, fractionation schedule, irradiated volume, and location (29, 59, 82). Brain necrosis developing >6 months after radiotherapy is uncommon when total doses of 50 Gray (Gy) are delivered in fractions of 2 Gy or less; a tolerance dose of 57 Gy has been suggested. However, children who receive30-35 Gy of whole brain irradiation frequently develop in-tellectual deciencies over the next few years (84, 156, 180, 189). Acute and early delayed effects are associated with short- term memory loss, fatigue, and somnolence (197). Acute re- sponses involving oxidative stress and inflammation can elicitapoptosis and signaling changes that contribute to disruption of the blood-brain barrier, hypoxia, transient demyelination, and more persistent injury (208). Late effects typied by de- myelination, vascular breakdown leading to edema, andradionecrosis of the white matter are progressive and gener- ally irreversible (181-183, 201). Current concepts of radiation injury now recognize that alterations to the microenviron-ment involving oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular dys- function, and impaired neurogenesis contribute to central nervous system (CNS) pathology and disrupted cognitiveprocessing (68, 69, 197, 208). Some of the more promising interventions for ameliorating radiation-induced neurocognitive sequelae are agents that inhibit inflammatory processes (169, 170, 217). Agonists tar-geting the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor family can attenuate neuroinflammation, in preserved hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive ability after irradi-ation (169, 170, 216). Inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system also has shown promise at ameliorating late effects in the CNS after irradiation (41, 176). One well-dened effect of cranial irradiation is its adverse effect on endogenous neurogenesis. Generation of CNS pro- genitor cells subventricular (SVZ) and dentate subgranular zones (SGZ) (74, 202). Each of these processescontributes new glia and neurons to the brain. SVZ-derived neuroblasts migrate along the rostral migratory bulb, while repopulate the granule layer of the hippo- campus (74). Irradiation depletes radiosensitive populations of multipotent precursors in the hippocampus, leading to aninhibition of neurogenesis and cognitive impairment (144, 167, 177). The growing evidence linking neural stem and precursor cell depletion to neurocognitive sequelae hasstimulated efforts that are aimed at cell replacement strategiesin the CNS. Regenerative medicine targeted to the CNS took shape soon after the rst isolation of neural stem cells from the ro-dent brain (173, 190). Application of stem cell therapies to ameliorate radiation-induced normal tissue injury soon fol- lowed, as neural stem cell transplants to the spinal cord werefound to ameliorate radiation-induced myelopathy (174). While radionecrosis remains a complicating factor for spinal cord treatments (34), neurologic dysfunction is now consid-ered the major dose-limiting factor for radiotherapy of thebrain (56). The sensitivity of adult neurogenesis to irradiation has stimulated efforts to explore the use of stem cell trans- plantation for reversing cognitive dysfunction after cranialradiotherapy. Recent work has demonstrated the benets of intrahippocampal transplantation of either human embryonic or human neural stem cells (hNSCs) to ameliorate radiation-induced impairment of cognition (1-3). In these studies, rats were cranially irradiated 2 days before bilateral in- trahippocampal transplantation of human stem cells. At 1 and4 months after irradiation and transplantation, signicant survival of the transplanted cells was demonstrated. Engrafted cells migrated extensively throughout the septo-temporal axisof the hippocampus and differentiated along neuronal andastroglial lineages. Importantly, rats receiving stem cell transplants showed improved cognitive performance com- pared with irradiated rats receiving sham surgery (1-3). Keyfeatures of the foregoing experimental approach are depicted in Figure 1.STEM CELL THERAPY FOR RADIATION DAMAGE TO NORMAL TISSUES 339 The mechanisms of stem cell-based cognitive rescue after irradiation are denitely compl ex. The benecial effects are likely to involve both the replacement of lost or damaged cells and increased trophic support to the brain by trans- planted cells or endogenous stem cells homing to the site ofradiation injury. Research by the group of Limoli has shown that transplanted cells express activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein, suggesting their capabil-ity to functionally integrate into the hippocampus (2).Moreover, trophic factors such as glial cell line-derived neurotrophic basic broblast growth factor (FGF) released from engrafted astro-glial cells may supportthe functions of mature host neurons or foster neurogenesis and the maturing neuroblasts (35, 80, 101, 192). The release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor from transplantedhNSCs has been shown to provide some cognitive benets in a mouse model of Alzheimer Disease (18). Moreover, bone marrow-derived stem cells may provide vascularsupport and help maintain the specialized vascular nichefor stem cell maintenance (54, 91, 150, 195, 220). They can be recruited directly to the site of radiation injury in the brain, where they appear to provide support to the microvascu- lature (28). While regenerative medicine holds considerable promise, inherent limitations to the repair of neural tissue present practical limitations. The migration of engrafted cells toward damaged tissue is a critical step in stem cell therapy, andfurther work is required to elucidate the chemokine signalingnetworks that regulate this process (16, 31, 95). The risk of immunorejection also weighs heavily on any transplantation study (9). These issues impact the assessment of stem cellsafety and efcacy in efforts to translate animal studies to the clinic (9). Clearly, there is much to learn, but despite these inherent shortcomings, the treatment of neurocognitivesequelae through stem cell therapy is a worthy pursuit, es- pecially in the absence of any satisfactory, long-term interventions for this serious complication of cranial radio-therapy. FIG. 1. Stem cell transplantation for ameliorating radiation-induced itive dysfunction. Immunocompromised athymic rats are subjected to cranial irradiation, while human stem cells ar e grown in parallel. At specied times (2 days, 2 or 4 weeks) after irradiation, animals are subjected to hippo campal transplantation with xed numbers of human stem cells. At specic times (1 or 4 months) after irradiation, animals are then evaluated for cogniti ve performance using NPR and FC tasks. Irradiated animals trans- planted with stem cells (IRR +hNSC) exhibit higher exploration ratios in NPR and i ncreased time spent freezing in the context phase of FC, demonstrating improved hippocampal-dependent performance . After completion of cognitive testing, the brains of animals are analyzed for engrafted cell survival, migration, differentiated fate ( NeuN-neuronal fate, GFAP-astrogl ial fate), and functional inte- gration by the expression of the Arc. A sterisks represent signicance ( p<0.05) compared to ear NPR, novel place recognition.340 ET AL. Stem Cell Therapy to Ameliorate Radiation-Induced Xerostomia Worldwide, about 500,000 patients are diagnosed with head and neck cancer (HNC) per year. Of these, 70% are treated with radiotherapy alone or in combination with sur- gery and/or chemotherapy (94). Radiotherapy of HNC ofteninvolves co-irradiation of the salivary glands that may induce hyposalivation, an important factor in the development of xerostomia (58, 204). To avoid a long-term loss of salivaryfunction, at least one parotid gland should be spared to amean dose of less than 20 Gy to preserve function if the other is targeted with a higher dose. Alternatively, when both glands are irradiated, total doses need to be less than 25 Gy,whereas the submandibular gland needs to be spared to doses less than 35 Gy (25, 50, 116). Current strategies that prevent radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction include the use of protective medication, such as amifostine or pilocarpine (24, 27, 120), surgical relo- cation of the submandibular gland (215), and minimization ofthe radiation dose administered to the major salivary glands(43, 62, 153, 203, 206). Although intensity-modulated radio- therapy has provided a signicant reduction of xerostomia, 40% of patients still develop life-long complaints (62).Radiation-induced damage to salivary glands mainly results from the inability of stem cells to produce a sufcient number of mature functional cells (110). Increasing the regenerativepotential of salivary glands by stem cell therapy should help restore tissue homeostasis, and adult tissue stem cells have shown great clinical potential (43, 44, 55). Interestingly, the non-functioning ducts mostly remain intact after irradiation (43), offering the opportunity for transplantedstem cells to engraft to a proper niche and to regenerate the salivary gland. Indeed, the protective effect of prophylactic pilocarpine (26) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) (126) seems to be due to stimulated proliferation of ductal stem/progenitor cells. Ductal stem/progenitor cells can also be stimulated by factors which are secreted by bone marrow- derived cells (BMDCs) that home to damaged salivary glandsafter mobilization (125). Some studies controversially claim that salivary glands which are damaged by irradiation can be res- cued by bone marrow stem cells that transdifferentiate or haveadopted an acinar-like phenotype (121, 199). Similar observa-tions have been made for MSCs (137). However, characteriza- tion of the most potent salivary gland stem cell is still ongoing. Current research is largely focused on the characterization, isolation, and transplantation of tissue-derived stem cells. Both mouse (164) and human (67) salivary gland stem cells can be isolated from cultured salispheres. While identication of thebonade salivary stem cell remains elusive, c-Kit +cells ex- hibited a remarkable capability to ameliorate radiation dam- age, as shown in Figure 2 (124). Furthermore, CD24/CD29,CD49f, and CD133 expressing cells were able to differentiateinto all salivary gland lineages (67, 124, 151, 164) and were able to regenerate the irradiated salivary gland (124, 151). Despite these advances, several issues need to be addressed before these laboratory-based ndings can be translated to the clinic (165). Evidence substantiating that functional recovery can be achieved through the preferential administration oftransplanted cells via retrograde ductal injection needs to be obtained. Moreover, while several candidate salivary gland stem/progenitor cells have been suggested for human use (13,42, 108, 127, 136, 157), safety issues need to be addressed experimentally before their clinical application (79). FIG. 2. Transplantation of salivary gland stem cells rescues mice from radiation- induced hyposalivation. Salivary gland tissue is dispersed to a cell solution and al-lowed to form salispheres in culture. Fromthese salispheres, c-Kit expressing stem cells are selected and injected into locally irradi- ated glands to improve saliva secretion[adapted from Gao et al. (75)]. n.d., not determined.STEM CELL THERAPY FOR RADIATION DAMAGE TO NORMAL TISSUES 341 Stem Cell Therapy to Ameliorate Osteoradionecrosis Irradiation of bone may result in four major complications: osteoradionecrosis (ORN) (139), insufciency fractures (40), severe alterations of bone growth, and radiation-induced neoplasms. Septic ORN typically occurs in HNC patients,combining radionecrotic ulceration and deep exposed mandible, whereas aseptic ORN may affect the hip in pelvic cancer or the ribs in breast cancer. The estimatedtolerance doses for mandibular bone are 60 and 72 Gy for 5%and 50% incidences of necrosis (63, 93). ORN is a non-healing wound resulting from hypoxia, hypovascularization, and tissue hypocellularity followed bytissue breakdown (139). Early stages of bone atrophy are linked to the imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption (103). Irradiation leads to the inhibition of MSCsand osteogenic cell proliferation (179) and may promote the terminal differentiation of osteoblasts (48). During progres- sion of the lesion, irradiated bone shows signs of osteopo-rosis characterized by atrophy and a disorganized trabecular structure, resulting from an imbalance in osteogenesis/ osteolysis, defects in neovascularization, and brosis. Afterirradiation, the myobroblasts appear at the initial inflam-matory phase and persist during the constitutive brotic phase (14). Transforming growth factor- b1( T G F - b1) is con- sidered the main cytokine involved in this process, resultingin increased extracellular matrix secretion and decreased metalloproteinase excretion (51). TGF- b1 plays an important role in establishing and maintaining vessel integrity byameliorating damage to the arteries and veins surrounding the bone after irradiation (161). Vascular damage and is- chemia appear before osteoblast alteration (60, 152). Treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aero- digestive tract often requires large surgical bone removal and reconstruction with anastomosed free flaps (90). Irradiation reduces healing capacities and is associated with a higher riskof vascularized flap failure. The use of calcium phosphate biomaterials has been considered an alternative to autoge- nous bone grafts. However, calcium phosphate alone is notsufcient for bone substitution in irradiated areas (119), and it needs to be used in conjunction with total bone marrow (TBM) for more optimal stimulation of bone healing (Fig. 3).Biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) associated with TBM provides better bone reconstruction after radiotherapy (131), whereas association of MSCs with calcium phosphate leads tobetter bone reconstruction in non-irradiated areas (12, 134,211, 221). Studies in an irradiated mouse model also showed that TBM was superior to MSC for association with BCP for bone reconstruction in irradiated areas (64). These resultshighlight the potential benets of stem cells used in conjunc- tion with biomaterials for combined regenerative strategies proposed in clinical applications (64). A current phase I clin-ical trial for mandible ORN treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov, identier: NCT01147315) will provide some of the rst results in humans. Stem Cell Therapy to Ameliorate Radiation-Induced Skin Fibro-Necrosis Acute skin reactions that range from a mild rash to severe ulceration are one of the most common side effects of externalradiotherapy. This pathological condition leads to pain, de- lays in treatment, and an overall decrease in quality of life(130, 141). Radiation dermatitis may occur after a total dose of 55 Gy and usually manifests within 1-4 weeks. At later times, subcutaneous brosis and occasionally radionecrosis maydevelop (20). Acute reactions result from the loss of rapidly proliferating cells, combined with vascular and inflammatory responses. Late radiation effects manifest in the slowly pro-liferating cell populations, resulting in progressive TGF- b1- mediated brosis and tissue hypoxia. Radiation-induced brosis and necrosis are usually considered intractable,manifesting as impaired healing and prone to recurrence evenafter minor trauma. A current management strategy for skin brosis includes anti-inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids or inter-feron gamma, with antioxidant (52). Under radiolesion becomes refractory to treatment, leaving sur- gery as a nal option, with increased risk of disability and morbidity. Such complications suggest the need to developnew therapeutic approaches using adult stem cells for therepair of radiation-induced tissue injury. Preclinical studies have identied MSCs as promising cell-based agents for the treatment of tissue necrosis. For clinical applications, MSCscan be expanded to mass culture, and they can be cryopre- served without loss of viability or stem cell potency (5, 118). Recent work has successfully demonstrated the preclinicalbenet of systemic MSC injections for ulcerated skin and muscle restoration after high-dose irradiation (17). The ben- ecial effects rely on paracrine mechanisms, by which cyto-kines and growth factors that are released from engrafted cells favorably influence wound healing (73). Recent studies have demonstrated a marked plasticity of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC), mainly comprising mes-enchymal cells. The harvest of adipose tissue is easy, generally involving minimally invasive lipoaspiration procedures. To- pical administration of ADSC into full-thickness woundsnormalizes defective wound healing in irradiated mice (61). FIG. 3. Bone marrow grafts treated with BCP.

ADSC have also been shown to incorporate into vessels and differentiate into en-dothelial cells, leading to improved perfusion and vessel density (61). A schematic demonstrating the plasticity and capability of ADSC to facilitate wound healing is shown inFigure 4. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) similarly incor- porated into differentiated into CD31-expressing en- dothelial cells, and increased perfusion and vessel density(102). re- quired for their proangiogenic effects (210, 212). The group of Rigotti (175) demonstrated that lipoaspirate transplantation was clinically effective in the treatment of the side effects of skin radiation. Autologous fat grafts showed ageneralized improvement of clinical symptoms in all 20 treated patients (104). Clinically puried autologous lipoas- pirates were also proposed by the group of Akita (7) for thetreatment of radiation-induced late skin complications. ADSCshowed the capability to promote the growth of a microvas- cular bed that facilitated the subsequent correction of chronic ischemic damage. The group of Klinger also recently dem-onstrated (32) the efcacy of autologous fat grafts in the post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS). The cohort was composed of 113 patients who were affected by PMPS andwho underwent mastectomy with axillary dissection and ra- diotherapy. The reported pain control with a mean follow up of 13 months could be linked to inflammation reduction alongwith an improvement in tissue quality and scar softness with benecial effects on nerve entrapment (115). Finally, adequate debridement combined with skin autograft and an injection ofMSC showed signicant therapeutic benet for approxima-tely 7 years in the medical management of severe skin and underlying muscle necrosis in eight patients (17). The foregoing pre-clinical and clinical studies have now demonstrated proof of concept for the use of stem cells in the therapeutic management of radiation-induced skin damage. Further innovations are now required to efciently translatethese ndings into clinical protocols for minimizing the side effects associated with radiotherapy.Stem Cell Therapy to Ameliorate Radiation-Induced Liver Disease Whole liver cannot tolerate more than 35 Gy of radiation therapy (RT) in standard fractionation because of the induc- tion of potentially lethal radiation-induced liver disease (RILD). RILD was recently analyzed in the Quantitative As-sessment of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic project (63, 96, 158). Patients with classic RILD present with symptoms of fatigue, rapid weight gain, enlarged liver, ascites, and anisolated elevation in alkaline phosphatase, *2 weeks to 4 months after liver RT (117). All other liver functions, including serum bilirubin and ammonia levels, are usually normal, unless the patients have radiation-induced reactivation ofhepatitis B virus replication. Histopathologically, RILD is characterized as a hepatic central veno-occlusive disease with occlusion of the central vein lumina and hepatic sinusoids byreticulin and collagen congestion and atrophy of centrilobular hepatocytes (66, 154, 171). Since radiation induces apoptosis of the liver sinusoidal endothelialcells (LSECs) in a dose-dependent manner, the clinical syn-drome has also been named sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (53). Besides endothelial injury, regenerating hepatocytes are sensitive to radiation-induced mitotic catastrophe, as noted inpatients with cirrhotic livers, who elevated serum transaminases and ascites, indicating radiation-induced he- patocellular death (36). Currently, there is no effective treatment for RILD (85). Since irradiation inhibits hepatocellular regeneration, it was hypothesized that intra-portal or intra-splenic would enable ef- engraft in irradiated liver lobes, and selectively pro- liferate in response to mitogenic growth factors as theirradiated host hepatocytes undergo cell cycle arrest and/ormitotic death. A model of RILD was developed in F344 rats after treatment with partial hepatectomy and hepatic irradi- ation (HIR) (88). Within 6 weeks HIR, acute effects in-cluded perivenous steatosis and hepatocellular atrophy, while late severe bile duct proliferation and periportal brosis by 12 weeks. of 5 \u00b710 6congenic he- patocytes ameliorated the acute and late effects of RILD and FIG. 4. ADSC for the resolution of skin injury. ADSC exhibit marked plasticity to- ward keratinocyte and endothelial cells. Stem cells of the adipose lineage have the ability to differentiate into epithelial cells,acquire a functional keratinocyte phenotype, and differentiate into vascular cells. These cells can be used to facilitate the repair ofradiation-induced skin injury as well as otherpathological conditions of the skin. ADSC, adipose-derived stem cells.STEM CELL THERAPY FOR RADIATION DAMAGE TO NORMAL TISSUES 343 signicantly improved survival (88) with normal liver func- tion. Immunohistochemical staining for donor hepatocytes revealed progressive proliferation with near-total replace- ment of the irradiated host hepatocytes by donor cells over 3months. Such results are shown in Figure 5, where donor- derived repopulation of a liver lobe subjected to partial irra- diation was demonstrated after hepatocyte transplantation(HT). Strikingly, proliferation of the donor hepatocytes oc- curred primarily in the irradiated liver lobes, evident in the lower power histomicrographs that highlight the efciency ofthe preparative regime for replacing hepatocytes depletedduring irradiation (Fig. 5). Since classic RILD manifests as sinusoidal obstructive syndrome, it was reasoned that acute loss of LSEC in irradi-ated livers would require rapid restoration of the sinusoidal endothelium. Therefore, LSECs were transplanted via an intra-portal or intra-splenic injection after HIR and a recom-binant adenovirus-expressing hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was administered to provide signals for donor cells. LSEC transplantation ameliorated radiation-induced sinusoidal obstructive syndrome irradiated hepatic sinusoidal endothelium by 8 weeks (100). Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the only curative therapy for many patients with terminal liver diseases. However, due to shortage of donor livers, there is a long waiting list for OLT. HT is being explored as a therapeuticalternative. However, HT is limited because the number of cells that can be safely transplanted into the liver is inadequate to compensate for liver function. Encouraged by the massiverepopulation of donor hepatocytes after HT for ameliorating RILD in rodents, focal liver irradiation was examined as a preparative regimen for HT in the treatment of metabolic liverdiseases (85-87). Several investigators have demonstratedthat preparative HIR in with hepatic mitogenic signals can selective engraftment (209) and prolifera- tion of donor hepatocytes in irradiated host livers (37, 111,132). Thus, preparative HIR has been used to correct liver function in murine and rodent models of inherited metabolicdiseases, such as primary hyperoxaluria (89, 97), Wilson's disease (133), and hypercholesterolemia (218). A phase I clinical trial (NCT01345578) of preparative HIR to facilitate HT has been initiated in patients with metabolic liverdiseases (70). Partial liver irradiation could be safely admin- istered using stereotactic body RT via three dimensional conformal or intensity modulated radiotherapy followed byHT for the treatment of inherited liver diseases, liver failure, hepatic gene therapy, RILD, and for generating human- mouse liver chimera animal models. Cardiac Damage and Stem Cell Replacement Thoracic irradiation signican tly increases the risk of cardio- vascular disease in cancer survivors. Long-term survivors of Hodgkin's lymphoma and childhood cancers have 2 to >7-fold increased risks of cardiac death for total doses of 30-40 Gy (200).Increased cardiac morbidity and mortality also occur after irra- diation for breast cancer, despite having a relatively small part of the heart included in the irradiation eld. The Early Breast CancerTrialists' Collaborative Group evaluated data from >30,000 women in randomized trials of r adiotherapy versus no radio- therapy and showed a 27% excess of heart disease in the irradi- ated group (38, 140). The risk of cardiac death was related to theestimated mean cardiac dose, increasing by 3% per Gy (140). Animal studies show that radiation-induced damage to the myocardium is primarily caused by damage to the micro-vasculature, leading to inflammatory and thrombotic changes and vascular leakage (184, 185). Progressive reduction in the number of capillaries led to reduced perfusion of the cardiacmuscle, ischemia, myocardial cell death, and brosis (65, 138). Animal data are supported by clinical studies that demon- strate regional perfusion defects in non-symptomatic breastcancer patients at 6 months to 5 years after radiotherapy (4,47). Radiation also predisposes to the formation of inflam- matory, unstable atherosclerotic lesions, which are prone to rupture and may cause a fatal heart attack (155, 191). There is currently no specic pharmacological treatment for cancer therapy-related cardiom yopathy, although symptomatic FIG. 5. Preparative liver irradiation for hepatocyte transplantation.

Animal studies have demonstrated some benet from the radioprotector amifostine when administered before cardiac ir-radiation (112), or pentoxifylline , in combination with the anti- oxidant vitamin E (19, 122). Recent studies have identied stem and progenitor cells that can generate myocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells and participate in regeneration of the adult heart (11, 15, 30). Circulating BMDCs also migrate to sites of ischemic damage inthe heart and can contribute to new vessel formation by fusionwith resident cardiac cells and by secretion of pro-angiogenic and survival factors. Preclinical studies show that both mobilization and transplantation of BMDC improve the microvascularity andcardiac function after acute myoc ardial ischemia and in models of chronic cardiac brosis (39, 45, 49, 147). Since radiation is known to cause progressive microvascular damage and capillaryloss (65, 138, 184, 185), this technology may also have potential for treating radiation-induced cardi ac injury (Fig. 6), although this has not yet been tested. Meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials demonstrate small, but signicant, improvements in short-term cardiac function after BMDC therapy, with reduced benet at later times (207, 214, 219). There was a positive correlation betweenthe number of cells injected and an improvement in cardiac function, but there were no signicant improvements in long- term survival (207). Preclinical studies indicate that only 1-3%of injected BMDC are found at infarcted areas of the heart, although ex-vivo enrichment of specic cell populations, for example, CD34 +cells, can considerably increase this en- graftment. Cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (CPC) and em- bryonic stem cells (ESC) have greater capacity for stable engraftment and proliferation, and they can differentiate intocardiomyocytes. There are several ongoing phase 1 trials us-ing CPC isolated from a biopsy of the patient's own heart and expanded ex-vivo (92, 166). Preliminary results seem promis- ing, but the numbers of patients included are very small (21).Challenges for the future in applying stem cell therapy for radiation injury to the heart include the identication andexpansion of optimal cell types, the number of cells, the route of administration, and the timing of therapy. Stem Cell Therapy to Ameliorate Radiation-Induced Proctitis Approximately 500,000 patients per year undergo abdom- inal or pelvic radiotherapy worldwide. Of these, 5-10% will develop pelvic radiation disease (PRD) within 10 years (10). Acute radiation responses, including abdominal pain,diarrhea/constipation, and malabsorption, may interrupt ordelay the radiotherapy protocol. Late radiation responses, including bro-necrosis, stulae, hemorrhage, and occlusion, can result in signicant morbidity mortality. Acute epithelial ulceration, mucosal and submucosal in- flammation, and chronic radiation charac- terized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition, vascularsclerosis, and muscular dystrophy. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of PRD include oxidative stress, stem cell death with compromised epithelial renewal (162), microvasculardamage with endothelial cell death, and pro-inflammatoryand pro-thrombotic changes (77, 143, 159). A current man- agement strategy for PRD includes anti-inflammatory treat- ment with sulfasalazine, vascular therapy with plasma coagulation, and pharmacological modulation of brosis. The management of severe radio- necrosis requires surgical intervention. Stem cell therapy may offer a novel strategy to treat PRD. In abdominally irradiated mice, MSCs injected via the tail vein engraft to the enteric mucosa (213), enhance structural re-covery, and delay death (186). The implantation of MSCs into the wall of the irradiated intestine facilitates repair of radiation-induced damage by inhibiting ulceration (113).Lorenzi et al. (128) reported that MSCs improved muscle re- generation and increased contractile function of anal sphinc- ters after injury. Engrafted MSCs might regulate epithelial stem cells niches that provide and maintain an optimal mi-croenvironment for stem cell function by releasing cytokines and growth factors such as interleukin-11, HGF, FGF-2, and FIG. 6. Radiation-induced myocardial damage and stem cell treatments. Irradiation causes microvascular damage and capillary loss, which leads to inadequate perfusion of the tissue and may result in myocardial in-farct. Bone marrow progenitor cells can eitherbe mobilized to the blood using growth fac- tors, or extracted and cultured in vitro to en- rich populations of endothelial progenitorcells. Mobilized or injected progenitor cells home to the infarct area and stimulate sur- viving cells to proliferate and regeneratedamaged tissue.STEM CELL THERAPY FOR RADIATION DAMAGE TO NORMAL TISSUES 345 insulin growth factor-I (187). Interestingly, repeated infusion of MSC-derived bioactive components after abdominal irra- diation increased survival, decreased diarrhea, and improved the small intestinal structural integrity of irradiated mice (75).Mitigation of lethal radiation-induced intestinal injury can also be achieved by the transplantation of bone marrow-de- rived adipose stromal cells (BMASCs). Transplantation ofBMASC increased blood levels of intestinal growth factors and induced the regeneration of intestinal villi, thereby ac- celerating functional recovery of the intestine (178). A sum-mary of pre-clinical data regarding the treatment of radiationpelvic disease with MSCs is provided in Table 1. In 2006, the radiation oncology accident at the public hos- pital in E \u00b4pinal-France affected 425 patients who were under treatment for prostate cancer. Patients were overdosed by approximately 10-20%. Clinical consequences were severe, and sequelae classied from grade 2 to 5 on the commonterminology criteria for adverse events 3.0 scale were noted (135, 160). Three patients received intravenous infusions of MSCs (5 \u00b710 6/kg) from allogeneic bone marrow derived from family donors for the treatment of hemorrhagic refractoryradiation-induced stulizing colitis. Clinical parameters, in- cluding pain, hemorrhage, and stulization, were evaluated (magnetic resonance imaging, colonoscopy) before and after(1 and 6 months) MSC therapy. Two patients showed a sub- stantial clinical response for pain and hemorrhage after MSCtherapy with no adverse events. One patient experienced a relapse in pain after 6 months and was responsive to a second infusion of MSCs. In another patient, early stulization was stopped by MSC treatment, with stable remission since thenobserved over a 3-year follow up. These positive clinical re- sponses suggest that MSC therapy may represent a safe and effective intervention for patients developing rectitis and/orcystitis of varying severity (205). Conclusions Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been successfully used over the past 4 decades for patients with hematologic diseases (81). Conventional myeloablativetransplantation includes conditioning with high-dose radio- therapy and chemotherapy to eradicate residual disease and recipient (host) immunity in preparation for healthy donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells (graft). This has been the rst and most robust demonstration of the efcacy of stem cell therapies to completely reconstitute a sterilized tissueafter high-dose radiotherapy, thereby opening new avenuesfor the treatment of other radiation-induced normal tissue sequelae. After more than a decade of intense activity, the science of stem cells seems to be catching up with its promise. Clinical trials have established techniques for cell delivery and Table 1.Pre-Clinical Model of Mesenchymal Stem Cell to Treat Pelvic Radiation Disease Main results Conguration Non human primate References Total body irradiation Engraft in gut 72 Mice Abdominal MSC when infused to mice that received either extended or localized irradiation, migrate to almost all tissues (including gut) where they engraft transientlyusually at very low levels of detection72, 145 Engraft into enteric mucosa 113 Repair radiation-induced intestinal damage by inhibiting ulceration 186 Favor reestablishment of cellular homeostasis by both increasing endogenous proliferation processes and inhibiting apoptosis of radiation induced of smallepithelial stem cells187 MSC release cytokine and growth factors such as IL-11, hepatocyte growth factor, broblast growth factor-2, and insulin growth factor-1 that prevent intestinalradiation injury.

The rst clinical trials for pathologies, including diabetes (98), cardiac infarct (57), Crohn's disease (76), or Graft versus Host disease (118), have demonstratedsafety with trends of efcacy. Preclinical studies presented in this review provide en- couraging proof of concept regarding the therapeutic poten-tial of stem cells for treating the side effects associated with radiotherapy at different organ sites, including brain, salivary glands, bone, skin, heart, liver, and gut. Initial clinical data forradiation-induced lung (114), bone (ClinicalTrials.gov, iden-tier: NCT01147315), and skin (17, 32) injury indicate that certain complications may be amenable to stem cell-based approaches. However, successful translation to the clinic stillfaces many hurdles. Subsequent work will be critical in de- termining if/how and when to incorporate stem cell interventions into clinical trials. By gaining a further under-standing of the molecular interactions between donor stem cells and host tissue, and how such interactions are modu- lated by host immunity (109), we could discover ways to ex-pedite the use of stem cells in the clinic. While datademonstrating the efcacy of stem cells in the clinic remain sparse, additional evidence demonstrating long-term safety is also needed; transplanted stem cells should not form terato-mas or undergo transformation and they should not promote tumor recurrence, even after complete tumor sterilization. Many of these issues are likely to be resolved by the appro-priate selection of stem cell types for transplantation, but re- quires further preclinical testing. Lessons from clinical trials should also be taken into ac- count; since the rst reported trial in 1995, cultured MSCs have been used in 125 registered clinical trials (registered at http:/ /clinicaltrial.gov/) without any reported confoundingside effects related to the cell therapy. The resistance totransformation of MSCs produced in four clinical-grade cell therapy facilities was investigated, and data demonstrated that MSCs with or without chromosomal alterations showedprogressive growth arrest and entered senescence without evidence of transformation either in vitro orin vivo (194). The long-term genomic stability of cultured adult stem cellsmay minimize certain concerns regarding their oncogenic potential (188). While current clinical data support the long-term safety of MSCs, concerns do persist, and some are related to the po-tential of transplanted MSCs to adversely impact tumor growth and metastasis after radiotherapy. A variety of ex- perimental tumor models involving the exogenous additionof MSCs have led to conflicting ndings regarding their ca- pability to promote or suppress tumor growth (105). De- pending on the model, mechanisms put forth have includedthe inhibition or promotion of apoptosis, angiogenesis, or immunity and related interactions within the tumor micro- environment. Understanding the mechanisms in which adultsomatic stem cells modulate tumor growth will be essential for the safe and efcient advancement of stem cell therapies that counteract radiation injury. A summary of data regardingstem cell therapies that are specic to the organ site fromselected clinical trials and pre-clinical studies are provided in Table 2. Pluripotent stem cells represent attractive sources of start- ing material for cell-based therapies, largely due to their self- renewing properties and their capability to differentiate intotissue from all three germ layers (8). The use of pluripotent ESC is still fraught with ethical controversy and concerns of genetic instability and immune tolerance (46, 106, 129). The group of Yamanaka (193) has recently developed a techniqueforin-vitro reprogramming of terminally differentiated cells, such as skin broblast, into pluripotent cells that closely re- semble ESC. These induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) couldbe used for transplantation, with theoretical reductions in the risk of immune rejection. Such a technology also provides the capability to generate cell banks for future uses. Despite thesepotential benets, several issues with iPS technology still needto be resolved before clinical use is possible. Viral integration strategies used for cellular reprogramming add an element of oncogenic risk, and reprogrammed somatic cells may harborunderlying mutations of unknown consequence (168). Regenerative therapy for radiation injury is at an important juncture. Breaking down traditional barriers between spe-cialized elds will be challenging, but necessary, if we are to move stem cell biology beyond basic science and toward the development of truly benecial regenerative therapies. Tofoster this sort of multidisciplinary collaboration, a paralleleffort needs to bring academic science in closer contact with clinicians. The fate of future stem cell physician-scientists and patients suffering from the adverse side effects of radiother-apy will certainly depend on the outcome.
