AGENCY INFORMATION The Department of Child Services was established in January 2005 by an executive order of Governor Mitch Daniels. DCS protects children who are victims of abuse or neglect and strengthens families through services that focus on family support a nd preservation. The Department also administers child support, child protection, adoption, and foster care throughout the state of Indiana. Terry J. Stigdon was appointed by Governor Eric J. Holcomb to lead the Department in January of 2018 . Director Terry Stigdon has dedicated her career to saving and improving the lives of Indiana's children. Prior to joining DCS, Director Stigdon spent almost 20 years at Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health, where she began as a pediatric intensive care staff nurse. Most recently, she served as clinical director of operations, where she oversaw strategy, finance, personnel, research and programs for several hospital divisions, including emergency, trauma and nursing. Director Stigd on's extensive pediatric experienc e has given her a first -hand view of the issues faced by children and families. She has a proven track record of building strong teams that result in positive outcomes for vulnerable children. She holds associate and bachelor's degrees in nursing and a mas ter's in nursing leadership and management. She serves on the boards of Indiana Emergency Medical Services for Children and Legacy House, which advocates for victims of violence and provides free trauma counseling. DCS' infrastructure includes local offic es in all ninety two (92) Indiana counties, organized into eighteen (18) geog raphical regions. In 2018, DCS created an additional region, managed under the same central leadership to encompass central office Family Case Managers (FCMs) from the Collaborative Care Unit and Foster Care Licensing Unit , for a total of 19 regions. In November of 2018, DCS decided to do some county/regional realignment to create a more equitable workload amongst the regions. DCS moved the centralized Institutional Unit to report directly to field leadership in Marion County. DCS realigned Benton County from DCS Region 5 to Region 2. DCS also re -aligned three counties from Region 4, which historically was one of the largest geographical regions in the state. As such, Huntington Cou nty is now a part of Region 6. Wells and Adams County are part of Region 7. DCS has a centralized hotline, in Indianapolis, with satellite locations in four other regions: Blackford, Lawrence , Vanderburgh and St. Joseph counties. DCS made the decision to d ivide its Marion County local office - DCS' largest office in the state's most populous city, Indianapolis - into four smaller local offices : Marion East, Marion West, Marion North and Marion South (the latter two will remain co -located in the current loca tion). This localization plan was initiated to create a more community focused structure that will improve access and quality of interactions with families by fostering a community approach to child welfare as well as improve employee retention. The compr ehensive organizational chart for the agency is Attachment A. 7 Prior to 2005, child welfare services were provided by the Division of Family and Children (DFC), a division within an umbrella agency, the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA). As a new cabinet -level Department, DCS was charged with providing more direct attention and oversight of two critical areas: protection of children and child support enforcement. The former mission statement, \"helping families help themselves,\" was changed whe n the new agency was created to \"The Indiana Department of Child Services (DCS) protects children from abuse and neglect. DCS does this by partnering with families and communities to provide safe, nurturing, and stable homes.\" In December 2005, DCS initiat ed a major shift in how Indiana provided services to children and families called the \"New Practice Model.\" The DCS Practice Mo del was founded on five core competency areas: Teaming, Engaging, Assessing, Planning and Intervening (TEAPI). The practice model incorporates an approach which includes engaging families, teaming and planning with families, and supporting families when possible, while still holding parents accountable for their children. This model operates through Child and Family Team Meetings, in which a DCS Family Case Manager facilitates an individualized team including the family members, informal supports, and relevant service providers that reviews strengths, risks , and needs, and develops and monitors the implementation of a collaborative service plan. In early 2018, Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb hired the Child Welfare Policy and Prac tice Group (CWG) to complete a comprehensive assessment of the Indiana Department of the Child Services. The purpose of this assessment was to examine the cu rrent performance of the child welfare functions of the agency and compare it to generally accepted national practice standards and outcome measures, identify prominent strengths and challenges, and produce recommendations for changes in any areas needing improvement. Upon completion of the assessment, CWG made twenty recommendations to the Department. The full report can be found here: https://www.in.gov/dcs/files/IndianaEvaluationReportCWGFinal.pdf . B. MISSION, VISION AND VALUES STATEMENT S 1. Mission The Indiana Department of Child Services engages with families and collaborates with state, local and community partners to protect children from abuse and neglect and to provide child support services. 2. Vision Indiana children will live in safe, healthy and supportive families and communities. 8 3. Values RESPECT - Every person has value, worth and dignity PREVENTION - Families should have acces s to the resources and knowledge to prevent their children from experiencing abuse and neglect SAFETY - Every child has the right to be free from abuse and neglect STABILITY - The best place for children to grow up is with their own families PERMANENCY - Children and older youth have the right to permanency RESPONSIBILITY - Parents have the primary responsibility for the care and safety of their children ACCOUNTABILITY - Each person is accountable for outcomes and one's own growth and development CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT - The agency will engage in continuous improvement efforts to improve outcomes for children and families C. COLLABORATION Collaboration and communication with stakeholders is vital to obtaining improved outcomes for children and families in Indiana. Feedback was used to identify system strengths and challenges when setting goals and objectives for the 2020 Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP). Over the next five years, the Department will continue to work closely with its various stakeholders ( providers, court/judicial employees, probation, foster/adoptive parents, older youth, etc.) to track progress towards the goals set forth in the CFSP and ensure better outcomes for children and families. DCS continues to leverage the Round 3 Child and Fami ly Services Review (CFSR ) to renew and enhance its efforts for meaningful collaboration with the state's child welfare stakeholders to make improvements to Indiana's child welfare system. As part of the program improvement plan development process, stakeholders were included on t eams focused on either safety, permanency, well -being, or probation initiatives. These teams were tasked with reviewing the CFSR findings and brainstorming ideas for inclusion in the program improvement plan. These teams met weekly for over a month and were made up of DCS staff, probation officers, judicial/court employees (judges, administrators, and staff), foster and adoptive parents, and service providers. Furthermore, CFSR findings are being used to inform changes and improvements during ongoing co mmunications with state child welfare stakeholders. DCS also continued the practice of exchanging and discussing the Annual Progress Services Report ( APSR ) with the Pokagon tribe during semi -annual collaboration meetings, as described in more detail in Se ction VI I of this document. DCS worked diligently with personnel from the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) on developing Indiana's Program Improvement Plan (PIP), which is embedded within the CFSP, as a result of the findings of the CFSR that was completed in June of 2016. DCS received approval for Indiana's proposed PIP on February 14, 9 2019. Indiana completed the baseline CFSR review of 65 cases between March and May 2018. The first Quarter of PIP implementation began on January 1, 2019. 1. Regional Service Councils & Biennial Regional Services Strategic Plan DCS collaborates with community stakeholders involved in child welfare through multi- disciplinary teams in each of DCS' 18 regions, known as Regional Service Councils (RSC). The RSCs com plete biennial plans, which include service arrays for the regions. All 18 RSCs participate in the Biennial Regional Strategic Services Plan (BRSSP) process. The Regional Management Team and Regional Service Council, in conjunction with regional service co ordinators and continuous quality improvement team staff, developed the BRSSP for July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2020. Completed plans were submitted to Central Office for review and signature by Director Stigdon. As in past years, the plans were developed usin g a collaborative approach, which included representation of stakeholders from the provider community, foster parents, youth, clients, probation, courts, CASA/GAL and prosecutors. Providers from the community were invited to participate in focus groups w hich concentrated on four (4) areas of the BRSSP: Prevention Services Improving Access to and/or Retention in Substance Use Disorder Treatment Services Preventing Maltreatment After Involvement Obtaining Permanency for Children in Care 24+ months The fo cus groups were asked to identify gaps in services and strategies to improve the quality of services and availability of service array in a region. The biennial plans identified gaps in services and strategies to improve the quality of services and available service array in a region. State -wide quantitative and qualitative data, ad hoc reviews, and improvement planning outcomes were used to assess regional progress on their plans. Prevention data was also part of the data used to develop the BRSSP, as well as regional reports on contracted community -based services by county and their utilization in SFY 2017. This data was used by the regions to develop both service strengths and gaps that could be addressed by DCS and the local communities. The Regional tea ms continue to utilize their plans to develop services within their regions and address service gaps that exist. In July 2018, the regions will begin the implementation plans for State Fiscal Year 2019 -2020. Available data and the BRSSP plans can be found by DCS region at the following site: https://www.in.gov/dcs/3927.htm . 2. Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC) 10 Meetings with the CMHC Workgroup occur bi -monthly to discuss initiatives and current challenges. The CMHC workgroup continues to work on fostering collaborations between the agency and the Community Mental Health Centers. DCS also continues its work with the Indiana Council of Community Mental Health Centers, and DCS attends meetings at the council bi -monthly . DCS and the CMHC Workgroup continue to focus on the initiatives developed in the priorities document which included the following: Expand membership Utilizing Medicaid Rehabilitation Option (MRO) Substance Use Disorder Treatment Ser vices Creative approaches to services Workforce shortages Timeliness of access to services Engagement & Retention of Clients Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) Education Children's Mental Health Initiative/Children's Mental Health Wraparound Infant and e arly childhood mental health Older foster and recently emancipated foster youth access to mental health services 3. Service Specific Workgroups DCS facilitates ongoing collaborative meetings to improve the implementation of specific services such as: Family -Centered Treatment o A Regional Service Coordinator facilitates an individual meeting with FCT providers on a monthly basis to review performance data, share successes, and discuss challenges or barriers in cases or other service delivery issue. Com munity Partners for Child Safety o The DCS Prevention Team facilitates a monthly meeting to review current practice in the field, discuss programmatic issues, and troubleshoot any challenges/barriers to services and currently exploring curriculum to better m eet programmatic needs. The group continuously discusses how to continue to meet the needs in the different regions. 11 Healthy Families o Healthy Families Indiana has several committees that meet on a regular basis and focus on different areas of the program t o ensure best practice and fidelity to the model. The committees provide feedback to the DCS Prevention Team on program improvement. Family Preservation Service o In an effort to keep families in -tact and offer holistic supportive services with one provide r the Department will be developing and offering a new service standard. The Family Preservation Service standard is a new standard for delivering family preservation services in the S tate of Indiana. Secondary to the Families First Prevention Service s Act (FFPSA) that was signed into federal law in February of 2018, this standard is being developed to address the need to give families and children available services in their homes to prevent the need for placement in foster care. The service provides a per diem to the referred agency to provide \"any and all\" needed services to the family to allow the children to remain safely in the family home. The minimum requirements are that the provider agency meet with the focus child(ren) within the family's home at least on a weekly basis. The provider agency must utilize Evidence Based Practices (EBPs) classified, at minimum, as a promising practice of ACF's Clearinghouse of approved EBPs. Provider agencies must align frequency, needs, and supervision to the EBPs that are utilized. Concrete needs must be addressed through service delivery if failing to do so would result in the child having to be removed from the home . Father Engagement o A Regional Service Coordinator facilitates quarterly meetings with Fath er Engagement providers to discuss what is going well with the program, review survey results, discuss any issues around fulfilling service components and how to resolve them and then provide time to have an open forum for the providers to network and get their questions answered. The Regional Service Coordinator provides continuous quality improvement (CQI) support to the Father Engagement providers to improve outcomes measures. Home Based Coalition Workgroup o This group is the sub -group of the larger Indi ana Coalition of Home Based Service Providers. The sub-group works on issues, assigned by the larger coalition group, that affect home based providers. The sub -group then makes recommendations to DCS to resolve the presenting issue and/or expand services for children in need. 12 Homebuilders o Monthly meetings are held with the providers to review referral information, capacity, discuss opportunities for training development and address any recommendations around programmatic needs. Consultants from the Institute for Family Development review CQI activities with participants. Sobriety Treatment And Recovery Teams (START) o Direct Line (comprised of field staff) and Steering Committee (comprised of management staff) meet on a monthly basis. Direct Line provides field staff the ability to discuss case issues and gain feedback on best practice. The Steering Committee drives f ield practice and ensures fidelity to the model. Programmatic changes/issues are addressed during this meeting. Quarterly calls are also held with substance use addiction providers. o Ongoing work is focused on program monitoring and the spreading of sca lable START principles across the state. Children's Mental Health Initiative Conference Calls o Quarterly meetings are arranged to discuss state -wide access sites, the Children's Mental Health Initiative (CMHI) , and the Children's Mental Health Wraparound Services. The conference call provides updates on youth in Wraparound, the opportunity for access sites and key contacts to communicate, troubleshoot, and discuss the positive outcomes, and provide DCS with feedback. Collaboration with the Indiana Division of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHA) occurs as they assist to facilitate the meeting. Any changes or updates to both programs are also addressed at this meeting. Multi -Disciplinary Team (MDT) (DCS, Division of Mental Health and Addictions, Bureau of Developmental Disabilities Services (BDDS) , Division of Aging) o The MDT consists of a team of individuals from a variety of systems who meet bi -weekly to discuss high needs youth and how to navigate the service delivery systems to meet their indiv idualized needs. This team joins forces to review specific cases that need guidance and manoeuvring through the system array, to ensure families are being served within the most appropriate service delivery system, to provide assistance to the local communities so families do not get bounced from one agency to another, to enhance supportive services within local communities, to assist local and community members find the appropriate services for families and children that prove best outcomes, and review any gaps in services throughout the state that arise through a multiagency approach. 13 State Interagency Collaboration o The State Interagency Collaboration meets monthly and is designed to prevent service duplication and share data between state agencies including, but not limited to: DCS, DMHA, BDDS, DWD, Task Forc e o The Children's Justice Act (CJA) Task Force meets eight (8) to ten (10) times a year to review policies on the handling of cases, training of provider staff and the community, and discuss trends in child abuse and neglect in Indiana . The CJA Task Fo rce has historically hosted an annual conference for multidisciplinary team members across the state , however the CJA Task Force is considering different ways of providing information and training opportunities in 2019 - 2020. o The CJA Task Force received informat ion about the goals and strategies of the Program Improvement Plan (PIP) in 2019. In anticipation of the three year assessment for CJA, the Task Force provided a survey to stakeholders to work towards identifying systemic problems in the State's response t o maltreated children, in hopes of improving front -end work related to victims of child abuse and neglect. DCS will continue to work collaboratively with the CJA Task Force and share updates to the PIP and CFSP/ APSR. Regional Provider Meetings o These meetings occur monthly or quarterly depending on the region. The meetings are provider driven and focus around topic areas that are pertinent to the providers at that time. Discussions may focus around referral or service issues, retention of staff/clients or review changes in service standards. The meetings also allow providers in the region to meet one another and network. DCS will continue collaborating with existing statewide associations such as Indiana Council of Community Mental Health Cen ters - Child and Adolescent Committee, Coalition of Family -Based Services, and the Indiana Chapter of National Children's Alliance. This facilitation includes monthly calls, yearly conferences, and break - out workgroups. 4. Commission on Improving the Status of Children in Indiana DCS continues to collaborate with the Commission on Improving the Status of Children in Indiana (Commission). The law that established the Commission defines a \"vulnerable youth\" as a child involved with the Department of Child Services, Family and Social Services Agency (FSSA), Department of Correction (DOC) or Juvenile Probation. The Commission Executive Director is Julie Whitman, who is administratively housed in the Indiana Supreme Court. The Commission is comprised of 18 members from the executive, judicial, and legislative 14 branches, and local government officials. Members of the Executive Committee include Mr. John Hammond from th e Office of the Governor , Loretta Rush, Chief Justice of Indiana, Terry J. Stigdon, Director of the Indiana DCS, Representative David Frizzel, and Senator Erin Houchin . A list of all Commission members can be found at www.in.gov/ children . The Commission was created to bring together all governmental agencies that work with vulnerable youth to address: Access, availability, duplication, funding and barriers to services. Communication and cooperation by agencies. Implementation of p rograms or laws concerning vulnerable youth. The consolidation of existing entities concerning vulnerable youth. Data from state agencies relevant to evaluating progress, targeting efforts and demonstrating outcomes. The goal of the Commission is to promote information -sharing, best practices, policies, and programs concerning vulnerable youth. In addition , the Commission cooperates with other child focused commissions, the executive branch, the judicial branch, stakeholders and members of the communi ty. DCS deputies serve on various task forces and sub -committees and present information to the Commission when requested. Terry Stigdon, Director of the Indiana DCS, also serves on the Child Services Oversight Committee . The other members of the Committee include Representative Wendy McNamara (Chair), Senator Frank Mrvan , Hon. Dana Kenworthy , Representative Melani e Wright, Senator Mark Messmer, Michael Moore ( the Indiana Public Defender Council ), Jim Oliver ( the Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Coun cil), Jolene Bracale ( the Indiana Department of Education), Sean McCrindle (Bashor Children's Home), and Leslie Dunn (the Indiana CASA/GAL program ). The top priority for the Child Services Oversight Committee is \"to support the well- being of Hoosier child ren by strengthening the Indiana Department of Child Services (DCS).\" The committee has focused on an increase in transparency of the agency and supporting Hoosier children all across the state (2016 -2017 Annual Report of the Child Services Oversight Commi ttee). Don Travis, the DCS Deputy Director of Juvenile Justice Initiatives and Support, serves as co -chair of the Juvenile Justice and Cross -System Youth Task Force with Judge Charles Pratt. The Task Force focuses on the promotion of interagency communication and coll aboration to improve prevention and outcomes and to address the unique and complex needs of Juvenile Justice and/or cross -system involved youth. Cross -system collaboration continues to occur and involves court , probation, and child welfare personnel throughout the state to provide education on Indiana's Dual Status youth. The Commission on Improving the Status of Children in Indiana (CISC) established a Commercially Sexually Exploited Children (\"CSEC\") Task Force in early 2016 in order to explore a statewide uniform assessment tool and process for identifying and working with youth who are victims of human trafficking. The CSEC Task Force (comprised of representatives from the judiciary, probation and correction officers, law enforcement, 15 prosecutors and public defenders, and other public stakeholders) created several user- specific screening guides to assist probation officers, DCS employees, law enforcement, educators and medical practitioners in identifying possible victims of human trafficking. DCS has implemented the use of the Human Trafficking Screening Tool and a corresponding Human Trafficking Assessment Tool. After the initial work was completed by the CSEC Task Force, the CISC reorganized the CSEC Task Force. T he CSEC Task Force was placed under the Juvenile Justice & Cross -System Youth Task Force as a subcommittee. The CSEC subcommittee continues to meet on a quarterly basis to review issues and trends regarding the commercial sexual exploitation of children. The CSEC subcommittee has been working on screening tools and has partnered with specific probation departments across the state on pilot projects to implement the use of the CSEC Screening Tool with juvenile -justice involved youth who have been detained. The pilot will expand the use of the tool in additional jurisdicti ons throughout 2019. The CSEC subc ommittee was also recently asked by the Indiana General Assembly (through the Children's Commission) to provide input on two issues by the end of 2019. First, the CSEC subc omm ittee has been asked to provide input on whether to support changing the requirement for children to be asked to admit or deny the allegations in the petition alleging that the child is a victim of human trafficking. Second, the CSEC subc ommittee has been asked to study the employment of a Human Trafficking Coordinator with DCS and to discuss and provid e feedback on potential responsibilities, including how the DCS Human Trafficking Coordinator could best coordinate with the efforts of authorities and entities in Indiana. Nikki Ford , Data Director at DCS , serves on the Data Sharing and Mapping C ommittee which focuses on sharing of data between agencies and mapping services needed to implement the objectives of the Commission's strategic plan . David Reed , DCS Deputy Director for Child Welfare Services , is a member of the Mental Health and Substance Abuse Task Force, which focuses on identifying and supporting creative and effective methods of improving assessment, access to treatment, and wraparound resou rces for vulnerable youth and households in need of mental health and substance abuse services.

As mentioned above, annual reports, member lists, meeting agendas, minutes, PowerPoint presentations, handouts, and other resources can be found on the website for the Commission on Improving the Status of Children, http://www.in.gov/children . 5. Older Youth Services Collaboration In an effort to continue to evolve and improve upon older youth services programming, DCS meets with key internal and extern al stakeholders routinely (bi-monthly) to seek feedback on older youth service s delivery, best practice to make program adjustments and program improvements. Workgroups have also been formed to review components of the service standards and make recommendation enchantments. The Older Youth Services (OYS) Community is made up of youth accessing services, those who recently aged out of services, the DCS Older Youth Initiatives (OYI) team (program staff), the DCS Collaborative Care Case Management Team (3CM st aff), older youth service providers, and other key stakeholders. In addition, 3CMs and OYS provider direct staff meet routinely (bi- monthly in some areas, more often in other areas) to discuss individual cases, resources at the local level and shared goals . The Indiana Youth Advisory Board (YAB) meets with quarterl y with the DCS executive team. YAB members provide DCS with an update on their current projects including recommendations on program s, and local and state child welfare improvements. YAB members participated on the Foster Parent Bill of Rights committee and also participate in foster parent recruitment events to bring awareness to the needs of foster homes. YAB members also advocate on the state and national level to improve child welfare policy. Indiana DCS is a part of the planning committee for the National State/Tribal Chafee and ETV Coordinators Meeting held on August 22nd - August 23rd 2019. The OYI team collaborated with Indiana Foster Success (CB25) to address the lack of college degree an d certificate persistence and attainment for youth who are receiving funding through the Education and Training Voucher (ETV) program. As a participant in the Jim Casey Youth Opportunity Initiative Results Based Accountability (RBA) Program , the Indiana State team lead focus groups with ETV funded participants and facilitated workshops with Indiana post -secondary student advocates to address the needs of improving post - secondary outcomes for foster youth with a focus on race equity and inclusion . The Indian a State team continues to meet monthly to address Indiana foster youth post -secondary needs. The state team consist of DCS OYI team, CB25 ETV program staff, an Indiana Youth Advisory Board member, and Indiana Commission of Higher Education. 17 The Older Yout h Initiatives team is collaborating with an internal DCS stakeholder, the DCS Permanency Practice and Support Division to implement Permanency Roundtable Plus (PRT Plus). A Permanency Roundtable is a team of DCS experts that come together in a very structu red setting to review permanency options for a child with uncertain permanency. The intervention is designed to facilitate the permanency planning process for these youth placed in out -of-home care by identifying solutions for obstacles to permanency. The PRT plus will add youth voice through participation in their own case permanency roundtable. The OYI team will provide expertise in authentic youth engagement strategies and support the youth through the roundtable process . 6. Youth Advisory Board The Indian a Youth Advisory Board consists of youth that are currently or have been a part of the Indiana foster care system. The YAB is comprised of current and former foster youth from the 18 regions within the State of Indiana. The YAB meets at least four times pe r year to develop and implement their mission to positively impact the foster care system in Indiana. In efforts to increase YAB participation and meet the needs of youth, YAB meetings are held in different locations across the State. During the current state fiscal year there were (15) regional meetings held across the state and 23 community engagement activities. YAB events consisted of providing training to a mentoring agency on how to engage youth and young adults in foster care, sponsoring a holiday c elebration for a group home, facilitating training for DCS staff, participating in a meeting with the Indiana DCS executive team, and joining the national youth board known as Foster Youth in Action. The vendor is required to hire an adult facilitator to facilitate meetings which includes planning, preparation for meetings, recruitment activities, arranging transportation for youth, and other activities related to facilitating YAB meetings. The vendor manages five regional boards and one state board. The YAB is designed to give youth ages 14 to 2 3, the opportunity to practice leadership skills and learn to be advocates for themselves and others. The goals of YAB are to provide an avenue whereby youth in care can inform DCS staff, placement facilities, foster parents, policy makers, and the public on the issues that impact teens and young adults in the foster care system. Fostering YAB development and youth participation will also further enhance collaboration, cultural competence and permanent connections with other youth and adults as they engage in the YAB process. This program will also assist with preparing youth as they transition from adolescence to a dulthood by recognizing and accepting personal responsibility, increasing well -being, and developing leadership skills. Each Regional Youth Advisory Board will meet at least 3 to 4 times annually. Meetings will include the following: (1) an orientation meeting and training for new members and as a refresher of the goals of the YAB as provided by DCS, the contractor selected to facilitate the YAB, and/or national consultants; (2) a discussion of ideas related to services provided to foster youth and develop recommendations to the State Older Youth Initiatives 18 Manager or designee; and (3) a discussion about the YAB annual work plan and ways to implement this plan. Additional meetings can be held to address upcoming projects to meet the needs and goals of each regional board. Youth will be encouraged by DCS and supported to participate in other conferences or DCS events occurring throughout the year and their involvement may exceed prescribed annual meetings. However, the YAB shall not exceed over 21 meetings an nually, this includes the yearly conference. At least one youth from each Regional Board will be selected to participate in one conference per year as a State- wide Youth Advisory Board member. The conference will be of the Board's choosing. The statewide YAB youth will participate in a preconference meeting with an overnight stay to finalize plans for participation in the conference. Statewide board members will be supported by DCS to ensure the youth's full participation. A childcare allowance of $25 per meeting will be available for any participating YAB member that requires child care assistance for their children. For those with multiple children, additional amounts may be approved by DCS. Financial stipends of $30 will be provided to each YAB member participating in meetings as well as hotel expenses and meals for overnight stays. The State mileage rate will be made available for transporting the youth to the meetings. A stipend of $25 and hotel expenses will be provided for the youth's caregiver/transporter for overnight stays with the youth also. Sign -in sheets will be maintained for each meeting. They will be completed by the youth participants and include each participant's name, contact phone number, and address. DCS will support conference calling capability, on occasion, to enable the YAB to continue to move their Work Plan forward, to meaningfully engage YAB members in planning activities and to further connections and relationship building among members and staff. 7. Additional Collaborations In addition to the work occurring with the RSCs, DCS holds regular meetings with provider workgroups to monitor data, assess areas for improvement, and implement strategies to improve outcomes for families and children. The current areas of focus for curr ent provider workgroups include: Community Mental Health Centers Improve access to mental health services for children outside the child welfare system through the Children's Mental Health Initiative. DCS has implemented access sites in all 92 counties with the opportunity to assist with wraparound services through the CMHC's and other Wraparound certified agencies throughout the State through the Children's Mental Health Initiative. Improve access and effectiveness of substance abuse treatment services, i ncluding MAT. Improve the utilization of Medicaid Rehabilitation Option (MRO) funded services . 19 Psychotropic Medication Advisory Committee The Indiana Psychotropic Medication Advisory Committee (PMAC) was launched in January, 2013. The PMAC is an oversig ht committee that meets quarterly to review the psychiatric treatment of DCS -involved youth, with a specific focus on psychotropic medication utilization patterns. This committee includes representatives from IUSM Department of Psychiatry, DCS, Office of M edicaid Policy and Planning ( OMPP ), FSSA, Health and Addiction ( DMHA ), pediatricians, social workers, psychologists, pharmacists, child advocates and other identified stakeholders. The PMAC monitors Federal legislation, reviews best -practice guidelines for psychotropic medication use, monitors Indiana prescription patterns, reviews formularies and makes policy recommendations to DCS and OMPP.

DCS is in the process of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Department of Corrections to continue contact between the inc arcerated parent(s) and their children. Monthly meetings are held with providers to continue developing the program and review data from the CFSR to identify opportunities for improvement. Home -based Providers In 2017, DCS implemented standardized train ing in collaboration with the home -based coalition subcommittee, CMHCs, and IARCA for all DCS contracted providers' staff. DCS continues to work towards improving communication and information sharing between providers and DCS. DCS is working on revisions to service standards, including revisions to staff qualifications, to ensure quality services are delivered. Indiana Association of Resources and Child Advocacy (IARCA) In 2018- 2019, DCS and IARCA met at least quarterly, sometimes more often, with speci fic focus on addressing capacity building, workforce challenges, and preparation for implementation of the Family First Prevention Services Act (FFPSA). Address barriers to child care for foster parents Address limits on home -based therapist caseloads, which is currently 12 Discuss contract compliance issues Discuss status of the Indiana Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) report During 2018, the quarterly IARCA meetings evolved into monthly FFPSA workgroup meetings, which focused on topics such as Qualified Residential Treatment Program ( QRTP ) requirements, options for aftercare, accreditation, availability of prevention services, and reimbursement for FFPSA services. Moving forward, meetings will focus on enhancing and streamlining our agency audit processes and providing additional support to agencies as appropriate. In 2019, DCS's Staff Development team will work collaboratively to develop cross -training opportunities for IARCA members and DCS staff. 21 Licensed Child Placing Agencies DCS continued monthly telephone calls with Licensed Child Placing Agencies (LCPAs) in 2018 -2019, discussing a variety of topics including recruitment, bed holds, obtaining placement documentation, contracts, rate information, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ES SA), and have included additional topics at the request of providers' in an effort to answer questions . These meetings will continue in the future and be re -assessed to determine future use and needs in support of a continuous quality improvement framework . Improve quality of services provided to children placed in licensed foster home settings. Improve relationship and communication between DCS and LCPAs. Monthly phone calls are designed to improve communication and answer any questions the provider comm unity has to quickly and effectively address issues as they arise. In 2019, DCS will begin hosting workgroups with IARCA and non -IARCA LCPAs in order to discuss foster parent licensing and home study requirements, as well as barriers. When appropriate, DCS will also include a representative from the Consortium for Children, which is the Structured Analysis Family Evaluation (SAFE) model owner. Residential Providers DCS continued monthly telephone calls with residential providers in 2018 -2019, discussing a v ariety of topics, including bed holds, obtaining placement documentation, contracts, rate information, Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), Medicaid prior authorization and billing requirements, and additional topics to assist with providers' questions. In a ddition, DCS created workgroups by inviting providers with subject matter expertise to focus on updating various service standards, such as the human trafficking and substance abuse service standards. These workgroups will continue as the residential licensing team works to update all current and active service standards. Improve access to high quality residential services, as well as, improve the relationship and communication between DCS and residential providers. DCS has continued its workgroup of providers who are currently serving youth who are victims of human trafficking, specifically sex trafficking. The group will focus on 1) developing best practices and service standard guidelines for consideration by DCS as they share treatmen t successes and setbacks, and 2) identifying gaps in the continuum of care for this population so that DCS can adequately address the gaps . The service standards have been completed . CANS Steering Committee (DCS and Dr. Betty Walton, Division of Mental Health and Addictions) Delivery of CANS Education and Support to all Field Staff Development of CANS Super User Training for DCS Supervisors Development of reports for evaluation and tracking 22 Continuous review of CANS projects such as the Breakthrough Series Participants on the Steering C ommittee include: the DCS D eputy of Field Operations , Manager of Data Management, Clinical Manager, Field Regional Managers , Deputy Director of Permanency and Practice Support ; CANS Advisory: the DCS CANS Program Manager, D CS CANS Consultants - and the outside partner is Dr. Betty Walton from DMHA Continued Collaboration with the Center for Child Trauma Assessment and Service Planning (CCTASP) and Family Informed Trauma Treatment Center (FITT) with partners from the Breakthr ough Series Collaborative (BSC) specialty at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in their efforts to promote trauma- focused, family informed comprehensive assessment and applications in practice through the use of the CANS State Interagency Collaboration The State Interagency Collaboration meets monthly and is designed to prevent service duplication and share data between state agencies. Collaborative Communication Committee (CCC) For the past five (5) years, DCS has collaborated with the 91 probation departments across Indiana on the implementation of Federal and state statutes, regulations and guidance. Each Chief Probation Officer is invited to participate in the CCC meeting, which occurs every other month each year. The CCC is utilized as an implementation committee, offering guidance and collaboration to DCS on the issues that affect the juvenile justice population that is served by and through DCS. This forum has been used on the implementation of Federal Law pertaining to victims of h uman trafficking, visitation of youth in foster care, and implementation of the Program Improvement Plan. This committee serves as the conduit for introducing family -centered services to the field of probation and receives regular feedback regarding the review of cases for the measurement plan relating to the PIP and CFSR. Consulates from Other Nations DCS has been increasingly serving children from immigrant families, in which at least one parent or child are foreign born. In order to improve effective child welfare practices when working with these challenging cases, DCS established the International and Cultural Affairs program that is responsible for supporting DCS staff and collaborating with various foreign C onsulates and Embassies. Systematization of procedures for collaboration has mainly been with Mexico as most of the foreign born children in DCS custody and the majority of the parents involved with DCS are Mexican nationals. DCS also collaborates with other consulates on a case by case basis. 23 The International and Cultural Affairs Liaison holds meetings on a monthly basis with the Consulate of Mexico in Indianapolis. These meetings are held with an assigned Consular agent of the Protection Department . DCS has established a positive working relationship with the Mexican Consulate in Indianapolis and communication is frequent. These meetings focus on the review of relevant cases , including reunification efforts, parental engagement, assessing the services that are either being provided or coul d be provided in Mexico, relative placement and preservation of family connections, as well as, developing protocols to regularize our procedures. The Mexican Consulate provides various types of assistance including the following, which are the most frequ ently used by Indiana DCS and part of our monthly meeting reviews : obtaining a home study for a parent/relative in Mexico who is being considered for placement; repatriation procedures; contacting and verifying location of a parent in Mexico; referring to services in Mexico; contacting and verifying the location of a parent residing in Mexico; referring to services in Mexico; communication with incarcerated parents under Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody and the verification and issuance of vital records for Mexican Nationals. The International and Cultural Affairs Liaison will have quarterly meetings with the General Consulate of Mexico in Chicago. The objective of these meetings is also the review of cases and the development of protocol f or our current processes. The General Consulate of Mexico in Chicago has jurisdiction over the counties of Adams, Allen, Benton, Cass, Dekalb, Elkhart, Fulton, Huntington, Jasper, Kosciusko, Laporte, Lagrange, Lake, Marshall, Miami, Newton, Noble, Porter, Pulaski, St. Joseph, Starke, Steuben, Wabash, Wells, White, and Whitley. The remaining Indiana counties are under the jurisdiction of the Consulate of Mexico in Indianapolis. To promote effective collaboration in cases involving Mexican nationals, DCS and Mexico developed and signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 2011. Per this MOU the parties agree \"...to join efforts to treat, with special care, the high number of Children in Need of Services (herein after \"CHINS\") cases involving Mexican minors located in U.S. territory, through the development of a bilateral mechanism that allows for the early identification of said minors and facilitates the exercise of the consular function referred to in the Vienna Convention and the Bilateral Convention.\" We have be en working the review of the MOU in order to enter into an updated agreement and to sign with our current DCS director and the current General Consul in Chicago, as well as, the current Consul in the Indianapolis Consulate Office. Meetings held periodically with the Mexican Consulate offices are used to consult on specific cases and develop protocols that are culturally competent and ultimately improve collaboration. DCS has been challenged by the increased influx of unaccompanied minors, primarily from Central America. The International and Cultural Affairs Liaison has been in closer communication with the Consulate of Guatemala and Honduras due to this migration phenomenon improving our collaboration efforts with these general Consulates in Chicago. Indiana Office of Court Services (IOCS)/Court Improvement Program 24 Juvenile Detention Alternatives Initiative (JDAI) - DCS collaborates with the IO CS (along with other state agencies) in the implementation and rollout of JDAI statewide. During the Round 3 CFSR, Angela Reid -Brown, Court Improvement Program Manager, participated as a reviewer and program improvement plan stakeholder. Dual System Youth (DSY) - As a certain percentage of youth are identified in both the juvenile delinquency a nd CHINS systems, DCS has collaborated with IOCS on the implementation of pilot sites to develop policies, procedures, and best practices for dua l status youth. On July, 1, 2015 , a new statute went into effect in Indiana to specifically focus on dual statu s youth. DCS and IOCS collaborated on the implementation of the statu te. Both agencies continue to work together to further put into practice Indiana Code IC -31-41 (Dual Status Youth ), which includes identifying dually identified, dually involved and duall y adjudicated youth. Furthermore, with the new statute, DCS continues to work with local juvenile justice partners in identifying service gaps for dual status youth and ways in which to serve this population. Court Improvement Program Child Welfare Improvement Committee -The following DCS representatives are members of this multidisciplinary committee: Heather Kestian, Deputy Director for Strategic Solutions and Agency Transformation , George Dremonas, General Counsel, and LaTrece Thompson, Deputy Dir ector of Staff Development. These DCS members are able to provide information to the committee around DCS initiatives and relevant updates. Court Improvement Program Collaborative Conference : Above & Beyond Helping Youth Achieve Permanency - On May 25, 2017, stakeholders from across the state, including many from the judiciary and DCS, participated in and/or attended this important event to meet and discuss the role everyone plays in helping Indiana youth achieve permanency. The Indiana Commission to Combat Drug Abuse The Indiana Commission to Combat Drug Abuse meets quarterly throughout the year to collaborate and discuss actions and ideas to defeat the drug epidemic. The Commission consists of important stakeholders from all sides: prevention, treatmen t and enforcement. The commission made up of mainly department heads is focused on directing policy and working with the legislature. DCS Director Terry Stigdon is a member of this important Commission. Indiana Protection for Abused and Trafficked Humans (IPATH) DCS is partnering with other Indiana agencies as a part of Indiana Protection for Abused and Trafficked Humans (IPATH) Task Force. DCS continues to work with IPATH on human t rafficking awareness efforts throughout the state of Indiana. DCS also works with members of IPATH on individual cases to ensure collaboration regarding interviews and services for victims and to assist in investigations and prosecution. Members of IPATH include various law enforcement agencies, federal agencies, external stakeholders and service providers. IPATH members have been asked to join the committee that fits their professional role. Indiana DCS is part of the 25 Youth Victim Services Committee (Y- VSC) , the Youth Working Group of the Community Awareness, Prevention and Education (CAPE) Committee, and has someone who serves on a regional human trafficking (HT) coalition. The person who is the Southern Indiana HT coalition task force liaison member also serves on the IPATH Core Group (Yvonne Moore). The IPATH Taskforce underwent a restructuring in December 2017. A part of that process was changing how the Core meetings are handled. The IPATH Core meetings are no longer open to all IPATH members; rather, they are attended by leadership from each committee and regional HT coalitions involved in IPATH. In March 2019, a representative from DCS began attending the quarterly IPATH Core Meetings in an effort to share and gather information regarding Human Trafficking . Indiana Adoption Program Council ( DCS, SAFY, Children's Bureau, Villages, and Wendy's Wonderful Kids recruiters) Presentation of prospective adoptive families for recommendation for Indiana Adoption Program and review o f children eligible for adoption is ongoing. CCWIS Transition Information CCWIS planning activities have already started for DCS. On March 8, 2018 , DCS submitted a CCWIS Planning Advance Planning Document (PAPD) to request CCWIS planning funding. An approval response was received from Administration for Children and Families (ACF) on March 9, 2018. On July 27, 2018, The Indiana Department of Child S ervices (DCS) declared a New Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System (CCWIS), and declared a Transitional CCWIS for the KidTraks components of the existing Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System (SACWIS) Management Gateway for Indiana' s Kids (MaGIK) child welfare information system. On July 30, 2018 DCS submitted an As Needed APD (ANAPD) to declare a New CCWIS system and a Transitional CCWIS system for KidTraks, as DCS is planning to replace the entire MaGIK system. DCS received a condi tional CCWIS approval from ACF on September 25, 2018. DCS is planning to replace the MaGIK system over the next three years in a two -phased approach. The first phase is planned to replace case management functionality with a CCWIS system. At the end of P hase I, Casebook (CB) will be retired. Once case management functionality is operational, the remaining KidTraks (KT) functionality will be replaced and added to the New CCWIS system as part of the Phase II development effort. The Phase I design, developme nt, and implementation (DDI) effort will include the creation of an application programming interface (API) layer to facilitate the efficient exchange of information between the new system functions and those of the Transitional CCWIS system (KidTraks), as well as a single standard data exchange with all CWCAs and external systems, as defined by 1355.52 (e) and 1355.54. At the end of Phase II, all MaGIK -related functionality will reside in the New CCWIS system and KidTraks will be retired. 26 Indiana Family a nd Social Services Administration Collaboration Children and families that come into contact may be in need of many things, including medical care. DCS regularly collaborates with relevant agencies within FSSA to ensure that children and families are receiving the necessary services. These could inclu de services offered within the Medicaid Managed Care atmosphere, such as Hoosier Healthwise or Hoosier Care Connect. Other potential services that are available are Medicaid waiver services, transportation, Medicaid Rehab Option and Psychiatric Residential Treatment. DCS will continue to develop a strong relationship with our partners in FSSA as they create new programs and improve existing ones. II. ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT PERFORMANCE IN IMPROVING OUTCOME S In the summer of 2016, the State of Indiana's Department of Child Services (DCS) participated in a traditional Child and Family Services Review (CFSR), a federal review of 65 randomly selected cases throughout the state to identify strengths and areas needing improvement in child welfare practice. 1 The Onsite Review Instrument (OSRI) used during the CFSR consists of 18 items corresponding to seven outcomes related to specific components related to child welfare practice. During the CFSR, all items were individually rated and then combined to determine p erformance levels in seven outcomes. Indiana began implementing PIP reviews in 2018 which began being completed biannually with 65 randomly selected cases statewide and maintain a 15% pull of Marion County cases per review period through 2020 or until achi evement of federal improvement goals on all identified items. Improvement goals are based on PIP baseline scores and determined by the federal Measurement Assessment Sampling Committee following the completion and finalization of the PIP baseline case rev iew. 1 The information in this Child and Family Services Plan is system -wide and general. It was not created to impact, and should not be extrapolated to impact, the merits of any individual case or employee action in pending or future lit igation. Each case or action should be reviewed and analyzed on its own specific merits, including peripheral and contextual factors, and independently from this Plan's information, which is system -wide and general. The Plan's information is not to be construed or interpreted as an admission to any liability, legal issue, waiver of any defense, or question in pending or future litigation. The Plan's information does not rely upon or otherwise reflect legal standards used in litigation that are defined in applicable Federal and State case law, common law, and Federal and Indiana Code. The standards that DCS uses in the creation or compilation of the Plan's information are not intended to and shall not replace any legal standards applicable in pending or futur e litigation. 27 Indiana finalized its PIP measurement plan in collaboration with the Children's Bureau Measurement and Sampling Committee (MASC) on February 1, 2018. To measure PIP compliance, Indiana's PIP measurement plan will incorporate the CFSR Onsite Review Instrument (OSRI). The Department is in the process of developing a Practice Model Review (PMR), to replace the previous quality service review, to ensure continued measurement of the key outcomes related to federal measures. The Department is currently d eveloping the instrument and the tool that will be utilized, modeled closely after the OSRI to ensure alignment of strengths and needs to federal outcomes. More information about the PMR is located in the Systemic Factors section. Indiana remains on an AFCARS Improvement Plan (AIP), which serves as a way to continually identify areas for the state to improve AFCARS submission data . The AIP lists findings, tasks, and notes for each element that is in need of discussion. Errors can be found due to codes, extractions, data dictionaries, information systems, policy, procedure, and/or cross -validation checks. The AIP brings these issues to light in order to discuss clarifications or changes to the data being pulled. DCS goals, objectives, and interventions are discussed in the Plan for Enacting the state's vision section, which contains a detailed outline of the approved Program Improve ment Plan. Tools used to determine DCS' current performance throughout the Assessment of Performance section include DCS' performance on the following: Round 3 results from the Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) ; Data from DCS' child welfare informat ion system, MaGIK ; and Indiana's ongoing PIP measurement plan which incorporates the CFSR Onsite Review Instrument (OSRI ) A. CHILD AND FAMILY OUT COMES: SAFETY In 2016, during the Child and Family Services Review Indiana achieved nationwide average performance levels required by federal guidelines in Item 2 of Safety Outcome 2 regarding services to the family to protect child(ren) in the home and prevent removal or re -entry into foster care. Indiana however did not achieve substantial compliance in the other two items located in Safety Outcomes 1 and 2. 1. Children are first and foremost, protected from abuse and neglect; and 2. Children are safely maintained in their own homes whenever possible and appropriate. The results from the CFSR round 3 review: Data Eleme nt Overall Determination State Performance Safety Outcome 1 Not in Substantial Conformity 31% Substantially Achieved 28 Following the round 3 review Indiana completed internal assessments related to Safety Outcome 1. This assessment involved compiling internal data from the DCS MaGIK System and doing internal file reviews to ascertain the reason for DCS' low Safety Outcome 1 results. DCS determined there were several underlying causes resulting in the low percentage related to timely initiation. The first identified issue was with the Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline (\"Hotline\") reports. First, there were time discrepancies for reports that required a one -hour response time. The Hotline was not providing the \"time\" of the Hotline report, specifically for one hour assessments, to DCS front line staff; therefore, staff was responding according to the time DCS field staff receiv ed the report and information from the Hotline. The results for many one -hour assessments were not being met, due to the discrepancy of time. DCS has worked with the Hotline and this issue has been corrected. The time frame to begin counting to determine w hether the report is initiated timely begins when the local office receives the report of child abuse and neglect from the Hotline. Second, the Hotline identifies reports of child abuse or neglect with victims as identified by report sources and will not include children who may have been connected to the household during an earlier involvement as a current victim of child abuse or neglect (children in the household will continue to be included in the report, but not listed as a victim of child abuse or neglect unless the report source identifies them as victims of child abuse or neglect). During the DCS data analysis, it was noted that some children listed on the report no longer lived in the home or in Indiana. In order to meet timely initiation, DCS mus t see all child victims listed on the report. Third, DCS has provided greater clarity in policy about when to appropriately link an existing or prior assessment to a new assessment. DCS believes that a better set of criteria for linking assessments will help alleviate issues surrounding the timeliness of initiation. This policy revision was effective on July 1, 2018. DCS will continue to track the reasons for approval of linking of assessments and the number of denials for linking of assessments. As part of ongoing CQI efforts, DCS will review the approvals and denials to determine whether policy or practice will need further revision. DCS continues to ensure the Item 1: Timeliness of Investigation Area Needing Improvement 31% Strength Safety Outcome 2 Not in Substantial Conformity 71% Substantially Achieved Item 2: Services to protect child(ren) in home and prevent removal or re -entry into foster care Strength 90% Strength Item 3: Risk and safe ty assessment and management Area Needing Improvement 71% Strength 29 safety of all children in households, as part of a holistic approach to assessing families and children. The second identified issue involved the assessment process and practice. The assessment of the compiled data further identified challenges related to the safety staffing process and issues with twenty -four hour and five -day assessments that l acked timely tracking by the family case manager (\"FCM\") and FCMS Supervisor. Through further review of caseload data, obtained from the various systems within DCS, and workforce turnover, from Human Resources, DCS was then able to identify that the reason s were due to significant increases in caseloads and instability in the workforce. It is important to note that while there was an increase in caseloads, DCS is not currently able to consistently split out the number of assessment caseloads from permanency caseloads in a large portion of the state. There are FCMs who manage assessments and permanency casework depending on the workload of the county. DCS continues to work with caseload data to determine whether it is possible to assign workload metrics to th ose workers who carry both assessment and permanency caseloads. As a part of recent legislation, the state continues to address ensuring caseloads are balanced using metrics for in -home cases, out of home cases, and assessments. DCS determined the policy relating to timely initiations was not clear and did not support good practice. In particular, the use of phone contact in lieu of timely face -to-face contact with the reported victim was unclear and oftentimes misapplied across the State. DCS is addressing this by clarifying policy around the application of any exceptions to the face -to-face contact requirement for the victim. Specifically, DCS revised current policy around face -to-face contact versus phone contact, to exclude phone contact as meeting th e timely initiation requirement. This policy revision was effective on July 1, 2018. DCS has provided additional information to staff through the clinical supervision framework on the updated policy and practice expectations. DCS will continue to utilize CQI processes in order to track the reasons why assessments are not initiated timely within our data system in order to make adjustments as needed in the future. In addition, current data from the Office of Data Management (\"ODM\") shows that as of April 20 19, timely initiation for FCMs with a face -to-face with the child victim is at 67% as compared to the CFSR results of 31%. On July 1, 2016, Indiana instituted a new practice of screening in all reports for children under three years of age in an effort to enhance safety of children who are among the most vulnerable in our population. After reviewing data points, DCS determined that this practice change was not improving safety of children under three years of age. As such, in early 2018, DCS ended the prac tice of screening in assessments based solely on the fact that a child named in the assessment was under three years of age. DCS expects this change to reduce the number of assessments. The Department is also in the process of assessing its screening thres hold by doing an analysis to ensure that we are screening the phone call appropriately. 30 Despite the increase of report, the Hotline's responsiveness has improved significantly. For example, in Calendar Year 2013 (CY13) the average speed of answer for non -LEA calls was 01:19, but in CY 2018 it was 00:15. The abandon rate has dropped from 9% to 2% with a majority of those calls that do abandon, doing so in under 30 seconds. The Hotline quality assurance process builds on the Department's Continuous Quali ty Improvement (CQI) process. Components of the Hotline quality assurance process include quarterly reviews including review of both written reports and call recordings to evaluate worker documentation and customer service and a yearly Hotline Survey, wher e callers to the Hotline are surveyed on their experience. Survey results from CY 2018 include that 98% of respondents rated their reporting experience as positive (2% neutral, 0% negative). Improvements in safety have been prioritized and are already being implemented. Indiana will institutionalize a standardized safety staffing process and complementary tracking mechanism in order to better triage uninitiated assessments. This will assist Indiana by focusing on timeliness of initiation of assessments be cause supervisors will track initiations that are not completed on a daily basis through a standardized safety staffing process. In an effort to support CQI efforts on this indicator, DCS Executive Management meets regularly to discuss the data to determi ne whether the changes that are made in practice and policy are addressing the issues around timely initiation . The manne r in which DCS was completing, formal and informal, safety and risk assessments presented some challenges . DCS reviewed data from the M aGIK system to determine the reason for the results. As noted above, caseload size and staff turnover were contributing factors. There were cases where the formal safety and risk assessment tools had not been completed, safety and risk assessments had be en completed but were not documented, or safety and risk assessments were not appropriately completed. DCS will utilize clinical supervision and ensure there are specific agenda items regarding the proper use of safety and risk assessments included at all levels, including the unit, Local Office Director, and Regional Manager levels to more effectively identify strengths and challenges in assessing safety and risk. Indiana has taken the initiative to allow FCMs to enter safety and risk re -assessments at de fined intervals throughout the case. The improved tools are available for use in the case management system for in -home cases and will be available for all cases in the future. This was completed in an effort to make enhancements to the safety tools to imp rove usability for FCMs. DCS will continue to monitor safety and risk re -assessment tools in order to make any needed changes. Through further review of the data, DCS found that on some occasions safety plans were either not created or communicated with fa milies; or that safety plans could be improved . During a review of the reasons why safety plans were not working as intended, DCS discovered that FCMs were not creating safety plans that were specific to the needs of the family or within the abilities of the family to complete. There was a lack of a c omprehensive understanding of how to draft an appropriate safety plan tailored to the family's strengths and needs. Lastly, there was a lack of an understanding of how to apply the basic principles of safety planning in order to support families and keep children safe. Staff must understand the basic principles of safety planning in an effort to 31 educate families about safety, which will keep children safer in their home of origin when possible. Staff have received guidance so that they are aware that safety plans must be documented in MaGIK. FCM Supervisors are responsible for continually discussing safety plans during clinical supervision with FCMs. DCS has provided a specialized Safety Planning training to field staff throughout the State. Based on surveys that were completed by staff after the Safety Planning training, field staff reported that the Safety Planning curriculum was beneficial and increased their knowledge of how to develop an appropriate safety plan with families. Staff development reviewed t he surveys and will continue to make changes to the curriculum as needed. DCS determined that there is a need to improve the rate of supervisor review and approval of appropriate safety plans. DCS will include the safety plan in the case plan and require supervisor review, at defined intervals, per policy requirements. DCS will also involve the courts in safety training opportunities and will include safety plans and case plans as part of court filings. To determine the effectiveness, or ineffectiveness, of safety plans DCS will employ clinical supervision and the Reflective Practice Survey (\"RPS\"). The CFSR data will be monitored to determine whether safety plans are appropriately addressing safety concerns and meeting the needs of families and children. DCS has started training all local office directors on the effective use of the RPS as a means to monitor direct practice with families and children. DCS will continue to monitor completion rates of the RPS along with any data gathered from RPS visits in order to make any needed changes to safety plans and safety and risk assessments. Over the next year the Department is looking at learning more regarding other options for safety and risk assessment tools, as well as, revamping the RPS to ensure that it is providing field leadership with the information necessary to better develop the skills and practices of front line employees. Indicators at a Glance % of Cases Scoring Strength Item # and Explanation CFSR 2016 Baseline 2018 Fall 2018 Spring 2019 Target % Safety Outcome 1: Children are first and foremost, protected from abuse and neglect Item 1 Timely Initiation 31.4% 40.5% 51.2% 70.3% 50.9% Safety Outcome 2: Children are safely maintained in their own homes whenever possible and appropriate Item 3 Safety Assessment 70.8% 60.0% 61.8% 63.6% 67.8% Following the round 3 CFSR results the Department implemented Program Improvement Plan (PIP) reviews to assess how the state continued to progress in areas where DCS was unable to reach substantial conformity. The above graph outlines the progress the stat e has made since it established its baseline and has since completed two of its bi-annual reviews. DCS has reached and continues to rise in substantial conformity in regards to timely initiation, Safety Outcome 1 and continues to make upward progress in achieving Safety Outcome 2. 32 B. CHILD AND FAMILY OUT COMES: P ERMANENCY In 2016, during the Child and Family Services Review Indiana achieved nationwide average performance levels required by federal guidelines in Items 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 for Permanency Outcome 2. Indiana however did not achieve substantial compliance in the any of the 3 items tied to Permanency Outcome 1. 1. Children have permanency and stability in their living situations; and 2. The continuity of family relationships is preserved for children. The results from the CFSR round 3 review: DCS is examining the factors for permanency not being achieved in a timely manner. In reviewing the CFSR, information from reports from MaGIK, the CWG report, and stakeholder interviews, DCS believes that some factors include courts who are unwilling to create legal orphans, courts not in agreement with a change in permanency plan, TPR not being filed timely, or a lack of a diligent search for an uninvolved parent. Between September 2005 and September 2017, an additional 9,627 children were in out -of-home care, bringing the total population of children in out -of-home care to 20,394. This represents an 89.4% increase.

As such, c ritical initiatives have already begun in an effort to reduce the time to permanency. DCS is also focusing on the importance of concurrent planning, to expedite goal changes that can lead to improved permanency rates. Another PIP strategy is to highlight the effort underway by the Indiana Child Welfare Improvement Committee (\"CWIC\") to discuss legal orphans. This is a multidisciplinary committee convened by the Court Improvement Program (\"CIP\") to make a statewide impact on child welfare matters. Indiana's CIP is contained within the Indiana Office of Court Services. DCS participated in the initial decision to begin a project on legal orphans, and has likewise been involved in each step of the project's progress to date. DCS provided Data from CIP Timelines s Measures indicates that children who leave care having achieved a permanency plan of adoption had a median time to permanency of 987 days in FFY 2016. (FFY 2017 data indicates this number has stayed relatively stable at 985 days.) The Legal Orphans project originated with CWIC. DCS, through its representation on the CWIC, has participated in developing this program and its recommendations. Both DCS and Indiana's CIP have been involved since inception through their CWIC participation. Although the CWIC did not discuss this when it decided to focus on legal orphans 14 and older, that age is consistent with the provisions of the Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act, which requires case plans and transition plans to be developed in consul tation with youth 14 and older. Starting at 12 months, Termination of Parental Rights (\"TPR\") is considered and decisions are being made about the child's appropriate permanency plan. The Legal Orphan Pr oject's Permanency Round Table Plus (\"PRT+\") concept is intended to augment DCS' Permanency Round Tables (\"PRT\") by providing expertise from other sectors in the child welfare system that know the child or are well acquainted with permanency options. Targeting youth in the system between 12 and 23 months in care makes sense for the PRT+ initiative and is in keeping with the stated goal of affecting the state's time to permanency for adoption cases. By targeting 14 -17 year old youth who have been in care for 12 -23 months, CWIC intends the Legal Orphan Pr oject (including its PRT+ initiative) to identify permanency options sooner for difficult -to-place children in stuck cases. CWIC believes that doing so will have a long -term impact on time to permanency in adoption cases. This is a critical piece to the PRT pro cess within the department, where concurrent planning is a focus. DCS has created a Length of Involvement dashboard that highlights cases that are more than 20% above the statewide average or median. This allows both field staff and local office attorneys to review the list, in real time, in an effort to understand the cases that are struggling to reach permanency. DCS is analyzing the data from cases in ten counties to determine the top reasons why cases are str uggling to reach permanency. DCS continues work with the IOCS to sh are outcomes from this project and work on solutions to correct any issues if the barriers to permanency are related to the court system. DCS has continued to use data gathered from this project to determine the root causes of barriers to permanency within the child welfare system and develop goals to improve timeliness to permanency. The Department has recently implemented a project on timely filing of TPR's with the courts involvement. The Department currently has efforts underway t o address the adoption 34 central eligibility process, as we ll as, functionalization of Adoption Specialists to achieve a more timely permanency. DCS will involve the courts in permanency training opportunities so that the courts and judicial officers are familiar with and hear the same message that FCMs receive, in an effort to have the entire child welfare system focused on timeliness to permanency. DCS held its first trial advocacy training in one of its medium size counties. This training was attended by local office staff (both attorney's and field staff), public defenders, CASA/GAL, and court staff. This training was a success and the state continues to partner with IOCS to roll out to other areas of the state. DCS continues to critically assess and take steps to resolve factors that contribute to attorney turnover and lack of expertise in planning and participating in evidentiary hearings. Indiana recognizes that improvements in engagement with children, parents/caretakers, and foster parents can address a number of CFSR Items and result in improved outcomes for children and families. Indiana will look at a number of ways to better engage families including a renewed focus on the DCS Practice Model. Even when parents report not being able to visit with their children, DCS will draw upon their enhanced engagement skills to continually reach out to parents in order to understand the barriers to visitation and to assist in alleviating those barriers. In looking at information surrounding visitation with children and parents and sibling visitations, Indiana has identified that the frequency and quality of visits needs to be improved in order to support continued relationships between siblings, children, and their parents and caregivers. Indiana needs to furth er evaluate the reasons behind the lack of quality visits and will seek better understanding as to what the barriers behind the lack of quality and sufficient visits. DCS believes this is crucial in achieving timely permanency for children and families.

DCS has not reached substantial conformity in any of the Permanency Outcome 1 categories, however continues to make upward progress to reach the necessary levels to reach substantial conformity. C. CHILD AND FAMILY OUT COMES: WELL -BEING In 2016, during the Child and Family Services Review Indiana achieved nationwide average performance levels required by federal guidelines in Items 16, 17, 18 for Wellbeing Outcomes 2 and 3. Indiana however did not achieve substantial compliance in the any of the 4 items tied to Wellbeing Outcome 1. 1. Families have enhanced capacity to provide for their children's needs; 2. Children receive appropriate services to meet their educational needs; and 3. Children receive adequate services to meet their physical and mental health needs.

When parents (or caregivers) do not engage with DCS, DCS should do a better job of c ontinually reaching out to parents to engage them in services and visits. One of the ways DCS can ensure communication with parents is to make sure DCS is visiting with the mother and father at regular intervals. The reasons for DCS not having a sufficient number of quality visits with parents or caregivers is unclear. In reviewing contacts between the FCM and children on their caseload, DCS has found a high rate of completed visits with children (please see section regarding Monthly Caseworker Visits for c hart). DCS does not see a corresponding link to visits occurring between children, their parents, and their siblings. DCS needs to better understand the root cause of the lack of visitation between children, parents/caregivers, and siblings. In order to do so, DCS will measure contacts, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to determine what could support the improvement of documentation of visitation as well as increasing the quality and quantity of visits among family members. Indiana has committed to a renewed focus on the DCS Practice model, in an effort to ensure wellbeing remains a key focus, which would improve key areas such as quality visits, formal and informal assessments, and case planning. T he Child Welfare Policy and Practice Group (\"CWG \") noted: \"DCS should reclaim the family -centered practice model that it adopted shortly after its formation. This will require: (1) a return to valuing and consistently soliciting and using the input of families and their support systems both in ongoing casework and in regular child and family team meetings; (2) learning to recognize and mobilize family protective factors that can help promote child safety even when some safety threats exits; (3) achieving an understanding of the harmful effects of child remov al and disrupted attachment for children as a counterbalance in considering whether removal is the safest course of action to address safety threats; and (4) increasing both the number and skill level of peer practice coaches available to staff.\" There wer e many factors that explain why the Practice Model was not at the forefront of DCS practice. Among those factors are an increased FCM workload, increased and significant turnover at varying levels of the child welfare agency, and an institutional lack of f ocus on the foundation and basics of excellent social work practice. Indiana DCS has a number of areas that hold regular and effective Child and Family Team Meetings (\"CFTM\"), which is a cornerstone of the DCS Practice Model, in order to increase family engagement in their cases. In areas that are doing well in regards to effective teaming, Indiana DCS will determine the factors that lead to success through the CFTM process and replicate those factors in other areas.

Indiana believes that to fully refocus on the Practice Model, and implement a cu lture of change, the renewed focus must begin from the top down. Practice Model training with Field management began on December 5, 2017 (after the on -site CFSR) when DCS Supervisors participated in a \u00bd entitled \"Leading Practice\", a re-intro duction to Indiana's Practice Model. DCS executive staff participated in a training in the latter part of 2018 to ensure a top down approach of understanding regarding the practice model at all levels within the agency. Additional training for Family Case Managers will be conducted and completed throughout 2019. Having fidelity to the Practice Model will assist children, families, and youth to have better outcomes after their involvement in the child welfare system.

III. SYSTEMIC FACTORS A. INFORMATION S YSTEM DCS launched a child welfare information system, the Management Gateway for Indiana's Kids (MaGIK) in December 2010. Originally, MaGIK was primarily the umbrella in which the intake module for child abuse and neglect reports was retained. Indiana transitioned from the previous SACWIS system to Casebook, a Commercial- Off-the-Shelf (COTS) solution developed by Casebook PBC, a private organization originally launched by the Annie E. Casey Foundation. Casebook became the system of record for child welfare dat a and was also housed under the MaGIK umbrella alongside KidTraks, the DCS financial system for service and residential providers. MaGIK has also umbrellas modules of DCS management reports, the CPI/CPS Portal for background checks, an index for DCS Forms , modules for Quality Service Review tools and tools for Reflective Practice Survey. Within Casebook, a child's legal status is easily seen from their case home page. This page will display the child's status, or if the case is still pending in court and is simply awaiting approval. Basic child demographics for name, date of birth, and photo are also displayed on this page, with more detailed demographic data captured on their individual person page. Any person page in Casebook allows for images to be uploaded, verification source s for DOB, phone number, e -mail, SSN, citizenship status and verification, race, Hispanic origin, any tribal affiliation alongside a membership verification, religion, languages, etc. Placements and location for the child can also be easily seen from the jump menu of the case page, alongside any removal information as applicable. Goals for every child can be described in their unique case plan, with permanency goals of reunification, adoption, and legal guardianship, emancip ation as a result of a planned, permanent living arrangement or placement with a fit and willing relative with concurrent permanency goals listed of the same. Since the time of the Casebook launch, DCS has moved in a direction of looking toward a highly configurable and multi -integrated platform to better serve the needs of users. To that end, in July 2018, Indiana declared its intent to pursue guidelines set forth from the Administration of Children & Families regarding the Comprehensive Child Welfare Information System (CCWIS), and to implement a CCWIS solution for field staff statewide. During the time frame of the most recent CFSP period, software development within Casebook has gradually been scaled back, with the most recent deploy of new functionality originating in an enhancement request occurring in December 2018 related to a policy change impacting CPS assessments. KidTraks is intended to serve as the transition system during the pursuit of CCWIS status, so regular and ongoing development will 39 continue as needed per business needs and requests alongside the DCS Forms application. DCS has also recently released modules in a Salesforce platform related to Human Resource surveys when an employee separates employment from DCS, an external facing Fos ter Parent Portal, and an Assessment Initiation module to integrate with a Casebook database to track and document the timely initiation of assessments. The Request For Proposal (RFP) focusing on organizational design for the CCWIS platform closed mid -July 2019, at which time the agency began scoring proposal to select a vendor. It is anticipated the RFP for the Design, Development and Implementation (DDI) vendor will be released before the close of calendar year 2019 . B. CASE REVIEW SYSTEM 1. Written Case Plan DCS policy and the Case Plan itself include all required provisions. Incorporated in Indiana's last Child and Family Service plan was a strong focus on teaching staff how to work with a family in developing a case plan. Policy 5.8, Developing a Case Plan communicates the importance of utilizing the Child and Family Team Meeting (CFTM) process to create plans for assessment, safety, service delivery, and permanency. A CFTM fulfills the requirement to hold a Case Plan Conference, if all required parties are present. If a family chooses not to participate in the CFTM process, a Case Plan Conference is held to develop the Case Plan. The Case Plan policy states: DCS will work with the parent, guardian, or custodian, extended family, child (if age and developmentally appropriate), and the CFT M, if applicable, in developing the Case Plan. Policy goes on to states that when developing a Case Plan, the Family Case Manager (FCM) will \"Determine the Permanency and Concurrent Plans that are in the best interest of the child and ensure that the goals, objectives, and activities outlined in the Case Plan support the Permanency Plan.\" DCS policy requires that case plans be completed within 45 days of initiation of the case. To allow supervisors to monitor whether case plans are being completed timely, the Child Data Summary Report includes both the involvement date and the case plan start date. The CHINS C ase Plan Overdue or Coming Due report allows for staff to track those case plans which have not been completed and those plans that are coming due in the next 30 days. While case plans are used consistently and updated for the court at periodic reviews, D CS continues to work towards improvement in this area. In the Program Improvement Plan, Safety Section 3 (d & e), which focus on ensuring that the safety plan is included within the case plan and utilized as a tool for discussion during clinical supervisio n between the FCM and Supervisor. Engagement Section 4 (a (i & ii)) focuses on enhancing case planning through the life of the case by engaging the family and children in the case planning through the Child and Family Team Meetings or case conferences, as appropriate. 40 2. Periodic Reviews DCS tracks Periodic Reviews through court orders and events captured within MaGIK . The Child Data Summary report includes a field for date of the last review, along with a field for the next scheduled periodic review. The Child Event Log report also allows for the option to sort by court hearing events for ease of access in tracking this information. 3. Permanency Hearings The Department tracks Periodic Reviews through court orders and events captured within MaGIK. The Child Data Summary report includes a field for date of the last review, along with a field for the next scheduled periodic review. The Child Event Log report also allows for the option to sort by court hearing events for ease of access in tracking this information. Indiana's PIP addresses working strategically with our court partners to ensure we are appropriately mee ting permanency time frames for children and families. 4. Termination of Parental Rights (TPR) Termination of Parental Rights proceeding are captured in c ourt orders and the MaGIK system. The 15 out of 22 month s with no TPR hearing report and the 15 out of 22 with a hearing but no TPR are both reports that are accessible by field staff. The Department is working through its PIP, Permanency Section 2 (c, d, and e) to address timely filing of TPR to ensure permanency in a timely manner for Indiana's children. In February of 2019, the DCS conducted a three -day intensive improvement project, called a Rapid Improvement Event (RIE), to do a root cause analysis on the timely filing of TPR and developed a solution to effectuate positive change. The RIE team consisted of DCS legal, field leadership, a representative from the Office of Court Services, and a CASA/GAL member. The team reviewed data, did a root cause ana lysis regarding the issues in timely filing of TPRs, created solutions, and developed an implem entation plan to be piloted in four different counties at the end of the event.

Notice of Hearings and Reviews to Caregivers DCS policy includes information regarding requirements for caregivers to receive notice of hearings and periodic reviews. DCS has recognized an opportunity to ensure we are meeting this goal and has included a related goal in Permanency Section 2 (a) of the Program Improvement Plan, which focuses on working with the Indiana Office of Court Services to increase foster/resource parent's opportunity for participation at court hearings.

The entire Bill of Rights can be viewed here: https://www.in.gov/dcs/files/Foster_Parent_Bill_of_Rights.pdf . C. CONTINUOUS QUALITY I MPROVEMENT (CQI) AND QUALITY ASSURANCE SYSTEM 1. CQI Structure DCS has routinely monitored the effectiveness of the Practice Model in order to establish the goals an d direction of the agency, Waiver spending, training, and service delivery. DCS has implemented a Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) process that will serve as the foundation for setting agency priorities, structure for internal and external collaboratio ns, and interventions as well as the continuum of service provision. To better support this work, DCS created the Division for Strategic Solutions and Agency Transformation (SSAT), which employs CQI and service review staff as well as the Office of Data Re porting and Research. CQI staff receive training on the Six Sigma Green Belt Certification program through Purdue University. CQI then engaged with various divisions to pursue initiatives which seek to create positive and lasting change to outcomes for children and families. These initiatives use a data- centered approach to identify areas for improvement at the outset and again utilize data to show meaningful change in whatever p rocess change was sought. The project teams are cross -functional consisting of varying levels of responsibility i.e. FCM, Supervisor, Division Manager, Local Office Director, etc. Additionally, the Strategic Solutions Steering Committee shall set broader direction for innovation for the agency and evaluate the initiatives on a regular basis in order to determine if there is local learning and programs that can be used across the state for agency -wide improvement. The Strategic Solutions Com mittee wi ll continue to m onitor and shape the CQI efforts driving servic e del ivery. I n add ition to the Strategic Solutions C omm ittee, there are several work gr oups that help supp ort continuous improvement efforts . The structure of CQI is such that it lends itself to potential initiatives, measuring current and projected performance, and evaluating impact and outcomes. As the Continuous Quality Improvement Team has grown additional staff members were trained in Six Sigma for Green Belt Certification. Along with the CQI team, staff from several other divisions were included for Green Belt Certification, and throughout 2019, 24 more staff members will attend Six Sigma Training. Moving forward, DCS intends to use Lean Principles in tandem with Six Sigma to further support transformation of the agency . The agency is actively engaged in developing and coaching agency employees in Lean Principles, CQI methodologies and project management best practices that are aligned with our DCS Practice Model. 43 The agency is currently exploring working with Simpler Consulting, a firm that partners with clients to drive meaningful transformations across all aspects of their business by aligning strategies, optimizin g resources, and streamlining operations, and instill a culture of continuous improvement. Simpler will provide the following types of services to assist with the Indiana Department of Child Services transformation: Leadership Engage and Coaching Value S tream Improvement/Rhythmic Support Program Management The Assistant Deputy Director of Strategic Data Driven Solutions has responsibilities focused on data management and analysis within all DCS applications, research into effectiveness of programs and ser vices, and an overall data strategy for the agency. DCS remains focused on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of child welfare services through expanded eligibility and a broader service array. In March of 2018, an additional Assistant Deputy Director position was added to the SSAT Division in order to coordinate, on an agency -wide level, CQI efforts, federal compliance needs, and to assist in improving the agency. The addition of CQI staff will allow DCS to further align the work the agency does wi th a continual feedback process and ensure support of data -informed decisions. 2. CQI Steering Comm ittee: Strategic Comm ittee (named the \"Strategic Solutions Committee\"), chaired by the Deputy Director of Strategic Solutions and Agency Transformation, to discuss and review agency priorities and oversee implem entation and on goin g activities regardi ng DCS initiatives. T he Strategic Solutions Comm ittee is comprised of the executive staff from al l DCS div isions, de monstrating the a gency's effectiv e childre n and fam ilies. T he Strategic Solutions Committee been involv ed in establishi ng interv entions and servic es deliver ed. The Strategic Solutions Committee will continue to m onitor and shape the CQI effort s driving interv entions and servic e delivery. The Strategic Solutions Committee was the primary oversight body for the Child and Family Services Review and the development of the larger Program Improvement Plan and Child and Family Services Plan . The Strategic Solutions Committee acts as the primary coordinating body for improvement initiatives whether they be broader, agency related, or more intricate improvements within specific divisions. The Committee recently began incorporating Value Stream Steering Team's divisionally in order to support the work and drive the change necessary within each agency division. 44 3. Technical Assistance with Data and Evaluation (45 CFR 1357.15(t)) DCS has hired two Assistant Deputy Director s with the Strategic Solutions and Agency Transformation Divis ion. These positions will be integral to measurements of performance through development of reports and data and to improve our continuous quality improvement focuses and will assist in meeting agency goals and objectives. Additionally, these two positions will play a central role in evaluating and measuring the PIP and will continue to work closely with the Children's Bureau Measuring and Sampling Committee and the Capacity Building Center for States. These positions will also help close the feedback loop and inform quality improvement efforts . DCS collaborates with Indiana University for evaluation of programs and training, including the evaluation of Indiana's IV -E Waiver program. DCS has a research and evaluation division to assist with any research needed to assist with goals and objectives. The DCS Quality Assurance procedures are currently being updated to add additional indicators to assess the quality and accuracy of data. As DCS implements its Program Improvement Plan, additional reports and data will be developed. 4. Improving the Quality Assurance System by Developing the Practice Model Review (PMR) System The Quality Service and Assurance (QSA) team consists of ten team members: two managers and eight team members. The current focus of this group is on completing the Program Improvement Plan (PIP) Reviews focused around our practice improvement plan and revamping the quality service tools used to measure practice across the state. To complete the PIP reviews this team prepares cases in addition to leading the review. We review 65 cases during two quarter of the review utilizing teams of two reviewers. The review teams talk with case participants in order to determine compliance with the federal tool. The QSA team pairs with a field partner to complete quality assurance (QA) on the cases to ensure adherence to the federal tool and that proper justification is provided to support ratings. Once the case review is compete, the QSA team discusses the strengths and opportunities of the case with the family case manager and management staff. Overall numbers are also sent to executive management teams to provide updates after every review within the quarter. This information has been utilized to steer continuous quality improvement projects throughout the agency including those related to permanency and legal proceedings. In order to develop and maintain Indiana's own review process, the QSA team is also working to revamp the quality service tools throughout the agency. This inclu des a revamp of the Quality Service Review (QSR), Reflective Practice Survey (RPS), Hotline survey, institutional review, and the creation of a tool to measure the effectiveness of the rapid safety feedback team. The QSR and RPS have been utilized by the state for many years , however the agency is redeveloping these in order to better focus on those areas that can measure our adherence to federal standards , by including measures currently captured in the OSRI, in addition to Indiana's practice model. In addition, it will measure the effectiveness of the overall child welfare system as it will add measurements of the legal system and quality of provided services. Indiana will utilize this tool to help identify 45 why things are or are not occurring in our system rather than focusing on whether it occurred or not as it has in the past. This new review process will be called the Practice Model Review (PMR) in order to keep the emphasis on our Practice Model and how it can be used to achieve positive outcomes for children and families. With the information, gathered from the PMR, RPS, and other quality tools, all divisions of the agency will be better prepared to focus their quality improvement efforts allowing for a continuous quality improvement culture of meas urement, identification of areas needing improvement, and improvement projects . D. STAFF TRAINING Introduction to Staff Training All training is coordinated through the Deputy Director of Staff Development and is incorporated in the DCS Training Plan. Staff Development works to develop and deliver high quality, relevant training content which offers ongoing experienced worker classroom trainings, computer- assisted trainings, 12 week new worker training, and leadership training amongst all levels of lead ership with in the Department. Post -training surveys continue to assist in measuring the effectiveness of training programs. All training and technical assistance provided to the field is located in the DCS Training Plan. In order to support training for hundreds of new employees each year, DCS maintains a Staff Development Department with 101 employees. The Staff Development Department works in conjunction with Indiana University (IU) to develop and deliver high quality, relevant training content. Current ly, the Department offers classroom and computer -assisted trainings, in addition to the twelve (12) week new worker training. The Child Welfare Education and Training Partnership (CWETP), a partnership between DCS and Indiana University, utilizes a formal training evaluation. DCS staff complete evaluations of training, which are then compiled and analyzed by IU. IU provides quarterly and annual reports to the Department. Pre and post testing of new workers is also included in the CWETP. All Providers comple te evaluations of trainings offered by DCS; however, we are working on incorporating an evaluation process for providers as well. DCS incorporated this formal evaluation for our Foster and Adoptive Parent Training effective June 1, 2014. The Individual Training Needs Assessment (ITNA) report identifies training needs as reported by Family Case Managers , Family Case Manager Supervisors, Local Office Directors and Regional Managers . Staff Development is looking to develop an ITNA for Central Office employees including management. Outcomes from these evaluations are included in the sections below. Important highlighted training activities are highlighted in the section below, however a comprehensive list and description of all training is located in the attach ed Comprehensive Training Plan. 46 Partnership with the Indiana University (IU) School of Social Work The Indiana University School of Social Work works in collaboration with DCS to better protect children at risk of abuse and neglect. A key to this collaboration is the creation of the Child Welfare Education and Training Partnership (Partnership) . The Partners hip is designed to provide high -quality social work education and state wide training for public child welfare employees. It provides bachelor- level social work students with preparation for employment as an FCM ; it allows DCS employees to enroll in the School's part -time Master of Social Work (MSW) Program; and it provides st ate-of-the-art training to current DCS employees. This P artnership is recognized nationally for its success and for its joint collaborative operation. Due to these efforts, Indiana is now seen as a model for the provision of public services that support children and families. More information on the partnership with IU and our training Department is located in the attached Training Plan. Initial Staff Training All new Family Case Manager's complete twelve (12) weeks of training comprised of 26 classroom days, 28 Computer Assisted Trainings (CATs) and 32 transfer of learning days in the field. Over time, DCS' FCM new worker training has been updated to reflect feedback of graduates and practice improvements. The Training Yearend Report of 2018 indicated th at 28 cohorts of pre -test and post -test were collected. Participants improved 11.4% on average from pre -test to post- test. About 65% improved by 10 or more questions. A little over 33% improved by ten questions or fewer. Trainees improved by at least 20% on the Getting to Know DCS and Case Planning and Intervening. They improved at least 15% Legal Overview and Assessing Child Maltreatment on curriculums. They improved less than 10% on Culture and Diversity, Permanency, Legal Roles, Teaming, Engagement, and Time Management. To better support staff transitioning into the challenging work of case management, a Field Mentor Program was implemented in 2007. This program matches a trainee with an experienced, trained, Family Case Manager in the local office to provide one -on-one support. When challenges are noted, training can be adjusted to better facilitate the transfer of learning from classroom to the actual practice of child welfare. The Field Mentor also completes skill assessment scales at the time of gradu ation. These are behaviorally anchored scales designed to assess the strength of the trainees' skills in each of 57 areas. Supervisors receive a copy of this assessment and can use as a basis to strengthen their newly hired staff's skills. Three months aft er graduation, the new employee's supervisor also completes Skill Assessment Scales to assist Staff Development with analyzing any additional training needs during the pre -service period. This feedback process provides the necessary link between classroom training and transfer of learning to job performance and provides specific knowledge about the strengths and challenges of training provided. When challenges are noted, training can be adjusted to better facilitate the transfer of learning from classroom to the actual practice of public child welfare . Feedback from this process is also used to provide necessary modifications to new worker curriculum. 47 Experienced Worker Training DCS continues to focus on experienced worker trainings, across all divisions, including leadership training opportunities as well. Supervisor Core curricula continues to be enhanced and the focus will be on service array and interventions through the lens of supervision, as well as best practices and clinical supervision topics. DCS will be developing a training with the focus on engaging resource parents. This will be for experienced workers and will discuss practices in engaging resource parents. In addition, we will be developing computer assisted trainings (CATs) that include visitation planning, safety planning, and engaging in the DCS Practice Model for staff. For visitation planning, we will incorporate how to develop visitations plans with the child and family utilizing a family -focused lens. This CAT will also include best practices in visitation planning. In regard to the Practice Model CAT, this will include information about how we carry out our vision, mission, and values utilizing practice principles and skills as well as building trust based relationships. It will st ress the importance of each of our roles within the Practice Model. We will continue offering supervisor and Local Office Director Quarterly Workshops for next year. This includes Practice Model and Leadership trainings, as well as best practices and clinical supervision topics. For the Practice Model training, a focus will be on the role of the supervisor in ensuring fidelity to the Practice Model. In regard to the Leadership training, a focus will be on how to carry out leadership techniques and utiliz e leadership skills in clinical supervision. Also , for next year, Staff Development will turn its attention to new local office director training curriculum. This will include a leadership focus, provide tips in enhancing leadership skills, and demonstrate how to incorporate leadership into clinical supervision. Foster and Adoptive Parent Training DCS remains responsible for foster parent training for DCS managed homes. By directly providing foster parent training, DCS has been able to expand the number and types of course offerings, and ensure improved consistency in the course curriculum / content. Prospective foster parents can take classes at night or on the weekends when the training fits into their schedules, while obtaining the skills and knowledge they need to provide quality care for DCS wards. The Department continues to enhance and develop training for foster and adoptive parents to ensure adherence to the practice model and policy changes. Information regarding the resource and adoptive parent t raining can be located in the DCS Training Plan. DCS continues to collaborate with Licensed Child Placement Agency (LCPA) Providers to develop trainings for their foster parents. LCPA's develop their own trainings, which is then vetted by the Department of Child Services to ensure it meets requirements. The DCS Resource and Adoptive Parent Training ( RAPT ) team works with LCPA's via a train the trainer model, some of those trainings include: all initial RAPT training, Trauma Informed Care, Cultural and Diversity. 48 Placement Disruption was piloted with foster and adoptive parents in the first quarter of 2018. This training focuses on learning about child placements, what causes placement disruption, how disruption can impact a child's safety, stability, permane ncy and well -being and what services and resources are available while working with DCS and the child's team to avoid disruption of the child's placement. DCS will continue offering this training to foster and adoptive parents. DCS will be developing a training on building resilience in children for foster and adoptive parents. A Six Sigma project on engaging foster parent curriculum for FCMs will be pilote d in 2019. E. SERVICE ARRAY There are three core objectives for services paid for through DCS. A. To ensure a safe home environment, B. To create permanency for children and youth, and C. To maintain/develop a strong level of well- being for children and youth. The DCS service array supports a safe home environment by providing the following services throughout the state. Home- based services including case management and therapy; Homebuilders; mental health services in collaboration with the Community Mental Heal th Centers including Medicaid Assessment to connect to the state- wide program to prevent residential placement for mental health needs, Medicaid Rehabilitation Option (MRO) services, Children's Mental Health Initiative (CMHI); substance abuse assessment an d treatment including the Sobriety Treatment and Recovery Team (START) model and principles; Family Preservation Service Standard; prevention services and programs including but not limited to: Healthy Families Indiana, Community Partners for Child Safety, and collaboration with Prevent Child Abuse Indiana across the state. The Department will continue to address gaps in its service array and work with its stakeholders and provider partners as it prepares to provide services to families and children under further secondary prevention options as a result of FFPSA. The Department will use opportunities within its approved Program Improvement Plan to enhance fatherhood engagement efforts and continued efforts around ensuring quality of supervised visitation with an eye towards safety by ensuring the appropriate service s are in place, as well as, expanding Indiana's substance abuse services and access. In addition to the above listed services, DCS also provides comprehensive homebased services that include many evidence -based practices such as Family Centered Treatment, Trauma -Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Motivational Interviewing, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Alternatives for Family Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Child Parent Psychotherapy, and Interce pt through Youth Villages. These evidence -based programs are designed to not only address the home environment, but also to address child well -being. 49 The breadth of evidence- based, trauma- informed services available to help children and families is a syste m strength. The Department has worked to create service mapping to help address the complexity of the service array that exists and directs case managers to the appropriate services utilizing the Risk and CANS assessment tools. The service array for achiev ing permanency for foster and adoptive children include the above mentioned service array (when appropriate) in addition to: Older Youth Services including Collaborative Care, Youth Connections, Foster Success utilizing Education and Training Vouchers (ETV) funds, Permanency Roundtables, Adoption Specialists, Regional Foster Care Specialists, and Relative Specialists. Having all of these comprehensive services across the state is also a strength of the DCS service array. An additional strength is that becau se many of the services are home -based making client transportation and access to services less of an issue. DCS is currently exploring the introduction of Rapid Permanency Review which is further outlined in the Permanency Measures section of the Program Improvement Plan. Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) Assessment DCS utilizes the Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths assessment tool to aide family case managers in identifying the individualized strengths and needs of a child and his/her family. Each month, the MaGIK system provides reports for field staff to review the Child and Adole scent Needs and Strengths tools completed the prior month for that region. Within the region's report, viewers of the report can drill down to county and ca se level information. This detailed report provides information to the regional managers and local office directors on those cases that could be referred for Medicaid services (if the child's behavioral health CANS recommendation is 3 or higher) as well as other diagnostic and evaluation services. A score of 3 or higher on the CANS behavioral health recommendation indicates supportive community -based services, intensive community home -based services, or high intensity services are needed to address concerns around mental health issues in the child/youth. It is also important to connect the child and family to the local community health center to ensure continuity of care after DCS involvement ends. The CANS report also indicates the placement CANS recommenda tions that are used to identify the level of care as well as services, and funding for contracted placements/foster care if the child requires placement outside of the home. These CANS reports can also be used during case supervision with the case managers to ensure the child and family are being connected to appropriate services. Family Preservation Service In an effort to keep families intact and offer holistic supportive services with one provider, the Department has developed a new service standard . The Family Preservation Service standard is a new standard an d delivery of services for the S tate of Indiana. This standard has been developed to address the need to give families and children available services in their homes to prevent the need of placemen t in foster care. The service provides a per diem to the referred agency to provide \"any and all\" needed services to the family to allow the children to 50 remain safely in the family home. The minimum requirements are that the provider agency meet with the focus child(ren), in the family's home at least on a weekly basis. The provider agency will need to utilize Evidence Based Practices (EBPs) and follow the models that they use for frequency, needs, and supervision. The Family Preservation Service is expected to be implemented in 2020. Service Mapping DCS initiated Service Mapping which utilizes the Risk Assessment and CANS to identify those families who are at high risk of repeat maltreatment. Using a developed algorithm, Service Mapping will create serv ice recommendations for evidenced -based models most appropriate for the child and family based on their unique needs. F. AGENCY RESPONSIVENESS TO THE C OMMUNITY The Collaboration section under Collaboration and Vision includes a complete description of the methods by which DCS is responsive to the community. DCS continues to look for opportunities to work with stakeholders to review and provide feedback on the goals and objectives outlined in the CFSP . To date, the agency has reviewed the goals and objectives outlined in the CFSP with several stakeholder groups. DCS intends to utilize the CFSP on a quarterly basis when working with its stakeholders, including but not limited to: providers, older youth, the courts, prob ation, and foster/adoptive parents. The Department is going to begin tracking progress made towards goals, in conjunction with its PIP, within the Child and Family Services Plan and discuss progress and goal adjustment/changes on a quarterly basis at its S trategic Solutions Committee meetings. G. FOSTER AND ADOPTIVE PARENT LICENSING, RECRUITMENT, AND RETENTION DCS is placing more and more children with relatives when an out of home placement is required, relying less on foster homes and residential facilities than five years ago. While DCS expects this trend to continue, licensing of foster homes and residential facilities remains vitally important. First, DCS strives to license relatives to provide needed financial support to the relative and children. Second, DCS will always need quality, unrelated foster homes when a relative cannot be located to care for a child. Third, residential treatment will be needed at times for those children with serious behavioral health needs in order to stabilize and return them to the community. Thus, DCS must continue to work to ensure that quality foster care and residential programs are available to children and families in Indiana. With regard to foster family homes, DCS licenses these homes through DCS local offices and thro ugh licensed child placing agencies (LCPAs). LCPAs are private agencies that are licensed by DCS and in turn license foster 51 homes on behalf of DCS. For foster homes licensed through DCS local offices , DCS has 122 Regional Foster Care Specialists (RFCS), who are dedicated to recruiting, licensing and supporting/retaining foster homes. As of May, 2019, DCS has 3,645 foster homes licensed through a DCS local office (out of the total 6,182 licensed foster homes in Indiana). DCS also has 3 9 Relative Support Spec ialists (RSS), who provide critical support to a relative in the first 30 days of placement. This includes explaining all of the financial options available to the relative, including licensure. As of April of 2019, DCS had 6,663 children placed with a rel ative (which is 46.2% of the children in out of home care). As a comparison, there were 6,746 children in non -relative foster care (or 46.7%). DCS has 2 4 Supervisors who manage the RFCS and RSS staff. The Department has recently centralized foster care lea dership to ensure continuity of services and best practices by ensuring that the foster care field division is housed under one Assistant Deputy Director. There are currently 4 Division Managers who manage both the foster care and relative care supervisors across the state. The Department has added a Foster Care Communication and Support Liaison, as well as a Kinship Navigator program manager to continue developing better programs and supports in working with our relative/kinship placements. DCS Licensed Fo ster Homes In order to ensure that state standards are applied to foster family homes licensed by DCS local offices, the DCS Central Office Foster Care Unit (FCU) is currently developing numerous worker performance and program metrics, as well as annual review procedures and tools. A weakness of our system is that we have not measured this program in the past. We have spent the last several years creating specialized foster care licensing workers within DCS, with a focus mainly on licensing and support. DCS is now beginning to focus on targeted recruitment and on measuring the program. To further improve in this area, DCS included Objective 2.2 and associated interventions within the permanency goals section of the CFSP. Additional details included in the worker and program performance plans are included below. Worker Performance Metrics The DCS FCU is working with the DCS Office of Data Management to design reports to assist field management in supervising Regional Foster Care Specialists (RFCS) and Relative Care Specialists (RCS) staff for their respective region(s). These reports will help in the quantitative measurement of staff performance. In addition, the following report metrics will also be analyzed in order to relate their impact on the qualitative outcomes measured during each region's yearly review which is outlined below. The reports that are currently in development will include the following data related to worker performance: Timeliness of licensing- The median and average time, by worker, to c omplete licensing. Report will pull all active homes as of the last day of the month. 52 Percentage of families who inquire that become licensed foster parents (Foster/Relative only separated). Homes with no placements in the last year, broken down by worker. This will not include families identified in MaGIK as relative or adopt only. Overdue Contacts Contacts not made or entered into MaGIK following placement and after placement leaves resource home. Caseload summaries for each worker broken down into the fo llowing categories: o Total licensed homes o How many currently have placements o Broken up into foster, relative, adopt only o Total applications pending o Annual Reviews/Re -licensures completed in the last month o Homes licensed in the last month o Number of placement s located in the last month o Foster family average of days from licensure to withdrawal o Corrective action plans due o Foster family home over capacity o Foster family home availability o Trend of licensed foster homes by agency o Waivers and exceptions for active f oster homes Program Metrics The DCS FCU will utilize the above and additional reports once they have been finalized for an annual review of each Region's foster care program. The yearly review will conclude with a discussion with the Assistant Deputy Direc tor of Foster Care and the Foster Care Division Managers on the findings and recommendations for program enhancement over the next year. NOTE: percentages will be determined once reports are generated and baseline numbers can be obtained. The following ar e the anticipated measures that will be monitored along with the above worker performance data. Goal #1 -Resource Families receive continued support and guidance. __% of families will have a minimum 3 documented contacts with their Foster Care Specialist during the licensing process. __% of families will complete the training portion of licensing within 30 days from RAPT 1 to completion of RAPT 3. 53 __% of families will receive contact (face to face or telephone) from the Foster Care Specialist within 5 business days of initial inquiry. __% of families will be licensed within 4 months (measured from inquiry to licensure). __% of families will report that they feel included as members of the team. __% of families will identify their foster care specialist as a member of their support team. Goal #2 -Children identified for foster home will be matched to t he most appropriate foster home available. __% of children in non -relative foster care will be placed locally. __% of current foster homes had a placement in the last year, excluding relative only and adopt only homes. __% of DCS/LCPA placements, excluding relative placements, will be made proportionate to CANS recommendations. Goal #3 -Minimize the number of disrupted placements. __% of foster homes with a new placement will have an assessment of the placement completed by the Foster Care Specialist within 7 business days. __% of Foster families will be contacted by a Foster Care Specialist within ten 10 days of a placement leaving the foster home. __% of Family Case Managers with a new foster home placement will be contacted by the Foster Care Specialist within 10 business days of placement. Goal #4 - Maximize the retention of foster families. __% of families that voluntarily withdraw or have licensed revoked within 18 months of initial licensure. __% of foster homes who have been licensed for at least one year have had a placement (excluding relative only and adopt only homes). __% of families who withdraw will not identify the following as reasons for their withdraw: o Lack of services/support for the foster child and/or foster family, o Communication issues with, o DCS local office, o Licensing worker, and o Service providers. 54 Licensing and Practice Review DCS FCU completes a licensing review and continues to explore efforts in conducting a quali tative practice review as well. The FCU, in conjunction with the Supervisors, will seek to perform a regional licensing audit from a stratified sample of resource homes. The assigned Foster Care Consultant will review the licensing file and MaGIK to measure the rate at which licensing requirements are being met. The following documentation will be reviewed for compliance: Initial Documentation: o Initial Inquiry o Application o Evidence of completion of pre -service training o Completed background checks (including waivers if required) o 4 references o Documentation to show financial stability o Child Care plan o Physical Environment Checklist o Resource Parent Role Acknowledgement o Home Study Annual Review Documentation: o Annual Home Study Update o Completed background checks o Licensing staff inquiry The following contacts will be reviewed in MaGIK: o Foster families will be contacted by a Foster Care Specialist within ten (10) days of a placement leaving the foster home. o Family Case Managers with a new foster home placement will be contacted by the Foster Care Specialist within ten (10) business days of placement. o Families will have a minimum of 3 documented contacts with their Foster Care Specialist during the licensing process o Families receive contact (face to face or telephone) from the Foster Care Specialist within 5 business days of initial inquiry. Licensed Child Placing Agencies For foster homes licensed through LCPAs, DCS has 30 contracted LCPAs that provide foster care services. The DCS Residential Licensing Unit (RLU) licenses LCPAs, and then the agency could choose to pursue a contract with DCS to provide foster care services, including recruitment, licensing and support/retention. As of May 2019, DCS has 2,538 foster homes licensed through an LCPA (out of the total 6,184 licensed foster home in Indiana). When 55 DCS RLU licenses an LCPA, DCS ensures that the LCPA and the foster homes licensed by the LCPA meet Indiana statute and rules. While an LCPA and a foster home license is valid for 4 years, D CS RLU conducts annual licensing reviews to ensure that Indiana statut e and rules continue to be met. The DCS RLU also conducts annual contract audits to ensure the LCPA is adhering to contractual requirements of the LCPA. The LCPA contract contains many q uality measures that are not in the licensing rules. In 2014, DCS RLU began audits of those contracts to ensure that quality services are being provided above and beyond the licensure standards. In 2017, the LCPA contract was revised to ensure continuous q uality improvement and adherence to best practices in the field. This contract was extended through 2019 and will be revised prior to January 1, 2020. Any updates to the contract will be shared with providers for input. Through recent discussions with pro viders, DCS RLU is exploring the idea of combining the licensing review and contract audit to reduce duplicity and improve efficiency. The DCS RLU is currently seeking input and feedback from providers in relation to the com bining of audits . When an LCPA is not meeting licensing and/or contract standards, DCS RLU utilizes a Plan of Correction. Depending on the nature of the non -compliances, DCS RLU may also institute a placement hold and/or a probationary status on the license. Additionally, if an individual foster home is not meeting standards, the same actions can be taken. Additionally, the DCS FCU has recently assigned a consultant to begin working with LCPAs on more targeted issues. DCS has learned that LCPAs have a lot of basic questions particularly with regard to licensing as staff turnover. The role of this DCS staff will be to provide training and assistance to LCPAs as issues are identified. DCS FCU also is developing a process to ensure that LCPAs follow up on all licensing complaints and CPS assessments with an appropriate action plan. In addition, the DCS FCU and DCS RLU work closely together to address underlying issues within a n LCPA as it relates to licensure of foster homes. Residential Treatment Facilities DCS RLU also licenses residential facilities. This includes private secure facilities, child caring institutions and group homes (collectively referred to as \"residential facilities\"). DCS has 68 licensed residential facilities, for a collective total of 134 residential licenses. Of the 6 8 residential providers, 64 have chosen to contract with the State, which allows them to serve DCS placed youth and adjudicated youth placed by county probation departments. The licensing and contracting process for residential facilities is identical to t he LCPA process. The DCS RLU issues 4 year licenses and conducts annual licensing and contract audits. DCS can take action against a license for noncompliance, including plans of correction, placement holds and probationary status. With regard to the resid ential contract audits, these began for residential facilities in 2013. The contract audits are completed by both the residential licensing specialist and residential clinical liaison. As with the LCPA contract, the residential contract was updated in 2017 and extended through the end of 2019. A new contract will be 56 implemented as of January 1, 2020. DCS continues to assess and monitor extensive programmatic and clinical standards. Examples include: All programs must utilize trauma focused CBT as a base com petency; Other evidence- based practices should be utilized that are specific to the population being served; Quality of treatment plans, monthly progress reports, and clinical documentation Independent living skills must be provided to all children 16 year s and older for a minimum of 3 hours per week; and Specialized service standards have been developed for the following programs: developmental and/or intellectual disabilities, youth with sexually harmful behaviors, short term diagnostic and evaluation, stabilization and diagnostic services, teen mom and baby programs, human trafficking, and substance abuse treatment. o DCS is currently working to revise these standards to adhere with ever growing best practices in the field. The Human Trafficking Standard w as developed and released in 2018 and the Youth with Sexually Harmful Behaviors was updated in 2019. DCS is beginning to revise the substance abuse treatment standard. Workgroups were developed to bring providers, experts in the field, and DCS together t o ensure collaboration in development of these standards. DCS is also speaking to various providers in relation to the development of a high acuity service standard to specifically address the provision of services for those youth that are difficult to place in Indiana. With the recent pass of the Family First Prevention Services Act (FFPSA), DCS is also working to incorporate the requirements of this Act into the residential contract. DCS is looking to also hold workgroups in relation to the implementati on of some of the FFPSA requirements such as after care services being prov ided by residential facilities. While facilities are in differing stages in regards to their treatment programs, DCS will continue to monitor the facilities closely to ensure those with strong evidence -based programs stay strong and to ensure that those that need to make improvements do in fact make the necessary changes . As with the LCPA s, DCS intends to look at the possibility of combining the licensing review and contract audit to streamline the review process. DCS is currently working with providers and soliciting feedback in relation to this possibility. Combin ing the residential licensing review and contract audit poses more challenges for residential licenses than LCPA licens es. The reason for this is one provider may have several different licenses which expire at different times. As there are statutes regarding background checks and timeliness of completion, this will have to be carefully thought through to ensure complian ce with Indiana Code. DCS is committed to continue to review practices in relation to both the LCPA and Residential audits to ensure the best possible services are provided to youth in care. One way of doing this is that the DCS RLU is currently 57 working w ith the DCS Strategic Solutions and Agency Transformation division to develop ways to collect usable data and assess trends from the audit tools. Stakeholder Feedback The Deputy Director of Placement Support and Compliance hosts a monthly conference call with the LCPAs and a separate one with Residential Providers to discuss hot topics, trends, policy, needed areas of training, and other relevant issues. Representatives from fiscal, training and other areas of DCS regularly attend the calls to answer questi ons. The onsite licensing and contract visits as well as these calls are major sources of information gathering for DCS to ensure that we obtain input from stakeholders. Additionally, DCS is currently working closely with LCPA and Residential providers to solicit feedback in relation to not only the audit processes but to also gather information and ideas in relation to the implementation of FFPSA. The Deputy Director and Assistant Deputy Director of Placement Support and Compliance have been visiting all licensed and contracted residential facilities and LCPAs to learn about their programs and gather individual feedback in a collaborative, one on one setting. These meeting will continue until all interested providers have been visited at their facilities. DCS has developed three Provider Relations Advocate positions which also provide an avenue for stakeholders to share thoughts, concerns, and overall feedback as it pertains to DCS. Background Checks and Case Planning DCS has statutory requirements for background checks for foster and adoptive families that exceed the federal standards. See IC 31 -19-9 and 31 -27-4. DCS also has extensive policy explaining the requirements for background checks as well as the procedures to be followed. See DCS Policy Chapt er 13. DCS also amended some of these requirements by way of Administrative Letter issue d, July 1, 2017. DCS RLU audits for compliance with background check statutes for all LCPAs and residential facilities as Indiana also statutorily requires background c hecks of employees and volunteers of LCPAs and residential facilities. See IC 31 -27-3, 5 and 6. Additionally, a foster family home cannot be licensed in the child welfare case management system unless background check information is added to the licensing checklist. As to a case planning process that includes provisions for addressing safety of foster care and adoptive placements for children, DCS currently uses child and family team (CFT) meetings for case planning. During the CFT meeting, a Safety Plan is created/updated, which includes the child's current level of safety in plac ement, visitation, school, etc. Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children DCS participates in the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC). The DCS ICPC unit produces a monthly 60 days overdue report to ensure Indiana is doing everything that it can to move ICPC cases quickly through the process. Home studies for ICPC requests for placement are required to be completed within 60 days. The 60 day overdue report shows how many are beyond the 60 days. The ICPC unit is revamping the 58 process and training by which they work with Field management to utilize these reports to manage timeliness of response. There is also a report that lists Indiana children placed out of state. Field management utilizes this report to monitor these placements as they work toward permanency for these children. Indiana continues to be open to border agreements with its neighboring states. These agreement s will establish a process to access t he safety and suitability of caregivers who have an existing relationship with a child, but live across the state border. A more comprehensive evaluation of the caregivers and their home would follow the initial, expedited assessment. DCS is a member of Re gional Judicial Opio id Initiative (RJOI) which is a multi- state collaboration that works together to confront the opioid driven epidemic to save lives and families by closing the gaps and removing the barriers involving information, enforcement, services and treatment. DCS utilizes the National Electronic Interstate Contract Enterprise (NEICE) system, which is an electronic web- based system designed to shorten the processing time of ICPC cases. In addition, the system should significantly reduce administrat ive costs. Indiana is working towards interfacing of our own case processing system with the NEICE system, with an eye towards more efficient monitoring and future processing of cases. IV. PLAN FOR ENACTING THE STATE'S VISION A. AGENCY GOALS The Indiana De partment of Child Services has worked as an agency to set forth annual and long- term goals. The Department employed the use of X -Matrices with attached action plans to visualize and track goal progress. These goals have been shared amongst all levels of le adership in the agency and Director Stigdon presented the annual goals at a Town Hall meeting held for all DCS staff statewide, those who were unable to attend in person were able to access the meeting via a live video stream.

PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT PLAN The Indiana Department of Child Services (\"DCS\" or \"Indiana\") began formal Program Improvement Plan (\"PIP\") development after receiving the Child and Family Service Review (\"CFSR\") Final Report and accompanying onsite presentation from the Children's Bureau in January 2017. The CFSR is a review of the entire child welfare system, not merely a review of the child welfare agency. The CFSR allowed Indiana to look at many different areas of child welfare to determine how the system was functioning. As a result of receiving tremendous participation from a number of child welfare stakeholders in Indiana, DCS was able to form four multi- disciplinary work/focus groups compris ed of DCS employees, juvenile court judges, attorneys, service providers, Court Improvement Program staff, and probation officers (as well as a variety of other stakeholders), that were tasked with meeting weekly to review the CFSR Final Report, CFSR stakeholder interview summary and other relevant qualitative and quantitative information to identify underlying factors that had the greatest impact on poorer performance areas within the child welfare system. These work/focus groups focused on developing solutions around specific CFSR items on safety, permanency, well -being, continuous quality improvement 68 (\"CQI\"), and juvenile probation. The work/focus groups developed solutions that served as the foundation for the PIP. Furthermore, throughout the PIP development process, DCS worked closely with representatives from the Children's Bureau and the Capacity Building Center for States . Indiana's PIP focuses on leveraging existing agency strengths to implement interventions that will have a sustainable impact on practice moving forward. Indiana has access to quantitative and qualitative data available from a variety of sources including, but not limited to, a statewide case management system, finance and referral system, Quality Service Review data (\" QSR\"), Reflec tive Practice Survey data (\"RPS\"), and Key Practice Indicator reports (\"KPI\"). While Indiana has had access to a myriad of data sources, the use of data to drive decision making has been inconsistent and unevenly approached. Indiana is moving towards a dat a-driven approach that will be used on a consistent basis to inform practice and to determine what is needed in order to effectuate change on both local and system levels. To demonstrate this commitment to data- driven decision making, Indiana has created a new division within the department: the Division for Strategic Solutions and Agency Transformation (\"SSAT\"). This new division includes the data team (including data analytics and management as well as research and evaluation) , quality assurance team and the c ontinuous quality improvement (\"CQI\") team. The CQI team focuses on CQI efforts throughout the state and the quality assurance team is responsible for service reviews and quality assurance efforts. 1. Goal, Strategies, and Objectives Related to Child Safety GOAL 1: ENSURE THE S AFETY OF CHILDREN TH ROUGH TIMELY INFORMED DECISION -MAKING BEGINNING AT INITIAL ASSESSMENT AND CONTINUING THROU GHOUT THE LIFE OF TH E CASE AND THROUGH THE PROVISIO N OF APPROPRIATE SER VICES. DCS' Core M ission is to protect children fr om abuse and neglect. In order to ensure the Department is successful in fulfilling that mission, DCS used information from a variety of resources to evaluate its strengths and opportunities for improvement in the policies, processes, training, services an d other resources the agency uses to ensure child safety. As a result of receiving tremendous participation from a number of child welfare stakeholders in Indiana, DCS was able to form four multi -disciplinary work/focus groups comprised of DCS employees, juvenile court judges, attorneys, service providers, Court Improvement Program staff, and probation officers (as well as a variety of other stakeholders), that were tasked with meeting weekly to review the CFSR Final Report, CFSR stakeholder interview summary and other relevant qualitative and quantitative information to identify underlying factors that had the greatest impact on poorer performance areas within the child welfare system. A few examples of data and information used to develop the objectives outlined in this section include: 69 Assessment and Hotline data, identified time discrepancies for reports that required a one hour response time and listed child victims that were not currently being identified by a report source but had been connected to the household during an earlier involvement. Review of Assessment and Caseload data identified challenges related to the safety staffing process and the lack of timely tracking of the assessment by the family case manager. Through further review of caseload data, obtained from the various systems within DCS, and workforce turnover, from Human Resources, DCS was then able to identify that the reasons were due to significant increases in caseloads and instability in the workforce. Information from the Individ ual Training Needs Assessment (ITNA) Survey, as well as the FCM Field Mentors and FCM Supervisor Training Skills Assessment Scales on the effectiveness of new FCM training and ongoing training needs for experienced staff . The CFSR identified issues in both the timeliness of initial investigations and ongoing safety monitoring and evaluation. To reflect these issues, the goal has been updated with language to focus on both the timeliness of initial investigations and ongoing monitoring. Activities in the approved PIP plan will also reflect a commitment to improving in these areas. OBJECTIVE 1.1 ENSURE TIMELINESS OF FACE TO FACE CONTACT BY FORMALIZING AND INSTITUTIONALIZING A SAFETY STAFFING PROCESS AND ESTABLISHING A MONI TORING MECHANISM FOR TRACKING TIMELINESS OF FACE -TO-FACE CONTACT. a) Ensure timely initiation of assessments by changing practice or policy, as needed. (i) Hotline staff will notify field staff of the time of the report of abuse or neglect according to policy so that field staff can ensure timely initiation. (ii) Hotline staff will correctly identify victims of abuse or neglect based on the actual report of child abuse or neglect that is received so that only alleged victims are required to be initiated timely.

Q1 (iii)Ongoing Implementation Supervisors will review safety plans and service referrals to ensure the needs match provided services through clinical staffings with FCMs OBJECTIVE 1.5 THE INDIANA OFFICE O F COURT SERVICES (IOCS) AND DCS WILL PAR TNER TO STRENGTHEN PROBATION PRACTICES FOR ASSESSING THE RISK, SAFETY, AND NEEDS OF SIBLINGS/OTHER CH ILDREN IN THE HOME. a) The Probation Preliminary Inquiry (PI), Predispositional Report (PDR), and Modification Report forms provides a standardized format for collecting and reporting information regarding a juvenile offender. The primary use of the PI is to provide the court with basic information regarding the offender. Based on this information, an appropriate decision may be made regarding probable cause and detention/release options. The primary use of the PDR is to provide information to the Court whi ch is essential to the judge in making an appropriate disposition. Complete and accurate information about all aspects of the case, with a recommendation when appropriate, enhances the Court's ability to order a disposition which represents the best interest of the juvenile, the family and the community. Both the PI and PDR contain elements that require a probation officer to assess the functioning of the family. The PI, PDR and Modification report instruction manual will be updated to provide explanatio ns for performing child welfare related risk, safety, and needs assessments of siblings/other children and parents in the home; and instructions will be provided on how to document the assessment findings in the PI, PDR and Modification reports. For the m anual to be updated , the following steps will need to occur: (i) Meet with the Collaborative Communication Committee to propose draft language for the manual update. (ii) Present the proposed draft language for the manual update to the Probation Officer Advisory Committee. (iii) Present draft language for the manual update to the Juvenile Justice Improvement Committee for possible endorsement. (iv) Present endorsement of the manual language to the Probation Committee.

This training may be provided live or via CAT. Target Completion Date Current Status Progress to Date CB Comments Q2 (i) Q2 (ii) Q3 (iii) Q3 (iv) Q3 (v) Q4 (vi) Q4 (vii) SAFETY MEASURES OF P ROGRESS Through i mplementation of the Goals, Objectives and Interventions outlined in this section of the CFSP, DCS will monitor, and anticipates improved outcomes related to the current and/or revised federal CFSR safety outcomes: Absence of Recurrence of Maltreatment. Maltreatment in Foster Care. DCS will also m onitor and anticipates improved outcomes related to key performance and practice indicator reports generated from MaGIK . Absence of Maltreatment after Involvement. Family Case Manager Visits. CHINS Placement. Safely Home, Families First. 77 Re-Report of Maltreatment. DCS also intends to develop additional reports and identify ways that technology can further support improved outcomes for children and families. As an example, in mid -April of 2019 DCS rolled out an Assessment Initiation tracking tool in an effort to more accurately track timeliness, extenuating circumstances, and any linked report method of initiation for all assessments. DCS also plans to identify strategies to better capture child visits completed by service providers. In addition, DCS pla ns to identify ways to measure utilization and effectiveness of proven, home -based services. DCS partnered with Casey Family Programs in the implementation of the Eckerd Rapid Safety Feedback\u00ae model. This program went live on January 1, 2018. Rapid Safe ty Feedback is a coaching/mentoring model that uses predictive analytics to assist in prioritizing which assessments get assigned for review. The problem statement that \"drives\" the predictive analytics is: mitigate repeat maltreatment whereas repeat maltreatment is defined as a substantiated allegation within one year of a prior substantiated allegation. DCS will continue to utilize this team to support our frontline staff by complimenting the work done in the field using evidence based practices to impro ve outcomes for our families and children. In 2018, DCS changed an initiative that previously prohibited screen outs of reports received for children under three (3) years old. The practice of automatically recommending an assessment based solely on the age of the child being under the age of three years old ended . Effective January 1 st, 2018, the Hotline implemented a new practice change in which the Structured Decision Making (SDM) Tool is utilized when making recommendations involving children under 3 years of age. If a report on a child under 3 does not meet SDM criteria, it should be recommended for screen out. Discretionary overrides may still be used. Currently, there are two supervisor reviews done on all screen outs involving a victim under the ag e of 3 years old. 2. Goal, Strategies, and Objectives Related to Permanency GOAL 2: ENSURE EACH CHILD AC HIEVES SAFE, TIMELY AND STABLE PERMANENCY OPTIONS DCS believes that every child has a right to appropriate care, a permanent home and lifelong connections. The objectives outlined below include a number of strategies to strengthen the types of placement and permanency options available for children requiring out of home care, and putting systems and monitoring mechanisms in place to improve permanency outcomes and time to permanency measures. DCS decided to focus on these objectives following an analysis of CFSR permanency relat ed outcomes , QSR permanency data, information from reports from MaGIK, the CWG report and stakeholder interviews. DCS believes that some factors include courts who are unwilling to create legal orphans, courts not in agreement with a change in permanency plan, TPR not being filed ti mely, or a lack of a diligent search for an uninvolved parent. Between September 2005 and September 2017, an additional 9,627 children were in out -of-home care, bringing the total population of children in out -of-home care to 20,394. This represents an 89. 4% increase. 78 Additionally, as of 2017, Indiana's rate of children in out -of-home care was approximately 13 children for every 1,000, which is more than twice the national average. DCS acknowledges that more work may need to be done to better understand th e root causes for the poor performance in the permanency indicators. Indiana recognizes that improvements in engagement with children, parents/caretakers, and foster parents can address a number of CFSR Items and result in improved outcomes for children and families. Indiana will look at a number of ways to better engage families including a renewed focus on the DCS Practice Model. To allow for improved monitoring and analysis in this area going forward, many of these objectives include interventions relat ed to data tracking or analysis and will be included in CQI efforts moving forward. OBJECTIVE 2.1 ENHANCE VISITATION SERVICE STANDARDS AND ATTENTION TO VISITATION PLANS TO IMPROVE QUALITY O F VISITS. a) In an effort to improve and capture the quantity and quality of visitation, roll out an updated Visitation Facilitation Service Standard to require service providers that provide visitation to document the quality of face -to-face visits. Ratings will be completed by providers in the Individual Visitation Re port to determine how the parent(s)/caregiver(s) did in each of the following areas: Demonstrated parental role; Demonstrated knowledge of child's development; Responded appropriately to child's verbal/nonverbal signals; Put child's needs ahead of his/her own; Showed empathy towards child; and Focused on the child when preparing for visits and during interactions (i) If the quantity and quality of visits does not improve, CQI staff will work to identify root causes of lack of improvement in visits.

This project aims to increase the amount and speed at which legal orphans, defined here as children aged 14 -18 whose parents' rights have been terminated reach permanency. The entities are collaborating to identify specific solutions that will increase the number of older youth that reach permanency and t he rate at which they do so. Data from the CIP Timeliness measures and data from DCS identified this as a need. Data from the CIP timelines measures indicated children whose permanency plan is adoption reached permanency in 987 days. Data from DCS in e arly 2016 indicated that children 1 4-18 were the most difficult age group to successfully achieve adoption . (i) The project will develop a theory of change and decide on interventions that will fulfill the theory of change. A draft theory of change was developed on March 3, 2017. The theory of change was further refined at the CIP annual meeting on April 10-11, 2017. The revised theory of change and proposed intervention was presented to the Child Welfare Improvement Committee on July 14, 2017. The Theory of Change was finalized on April 13, 2018. The theory of change is \"A Permanency Roundtable Plus model will be piloted in one DCS region to enhance engagement of legal orphans in developing youth -driven goals.\" The requirements for the PRT Plus will be completed and a DCS region will be identified for implementation.

DURING THE STATE'S CFSR, PERMANENCY WAS IDENT IFIED AS A STRENGTH IN ONLY 52.5% OF THE CASES. TO REDUCE TIME TO PERMA NENCY DCS WILL IMPLE MENT THE OUTLIER PERMANENCY APPLICATION AND REGIONAL PERMANE NCY TEAM PROCESSES ST ATEWIDE. a) Test and evaluate the effectiveness of the permanency application in innovation zones. The permanency application identifies outlier involvements and provides a workflow to prioritize cases for supplemental review in either monthly Regional Permanency Team meetings or quarterly Permanency Round Tables (PRTs). Outlier cases are identified based on current case duration and a set of key characteristics that have been predictive of time to permanency (e.g., placement, age, drug involvement , etc. ). Since implementation of the permanency application in innovation zone regions 3, 5 and 9 ; 2,059 involvements have been processed as outliers (time period of implementation is February 20 17 to July 31, 2018). As of July 31, 2018, 60.91% of those involvements have closed in regions 3, 5 and 9. (i) Complete an analysis of the permanency outlier application to review for effectiveness in identifying cases and moving cases to case closure. (ii) If the permanency outlier application is deemed to be effective, DCS will roll -out permanency application process in three phases statewide. (iii) DCS will analyze the permanency outlier application to determine whether there are commonalities that exist in outlier cases with an eye to determine how to prevent children from reaching outlier status.

The Assistant Deputy of Agency Transformation of Lean Principles and Advanced Lean Practitioners conduct regular check -ins with regional managers to assess any existing and ongoing regional or county base d issues. PERMANENCY MEASURES OF PROGRESS Through i mplementation of the Goal , Strategies, and Objectives outlined in this section of the CFSP, DCS will monitor, and anticipates improved outcomes related to the current and/or revised federal CFSR permanen cy outcomes: Improved Placement Stability and/or Reduction in the number of placement and adoption disruptions. Decrease in the length of time to permanency for all permanency options. 91 Permanency in 12 months for children entering foster care Permanency in 12 months for children in foster care for 2 years or more Re-Entry into Foster Care DCS continues to utilize PRT's to support permanency planning for youth in care. DCS is currently piloting PRT+, the Legal Orphan project, intended to augment DCS' current Permanency Round Table by providing expertise from other sectors in the child welfare system that know the child or are well acquainted with permanency options. Targeting youth in the system between 12 and 23 months in care makes sense for the PRT+ initiative and is in keeping with the stated goal of affecting the state's time to permanency for adoption cases. By targeting 14 -17 year old youth who have been in care for 12 -23 months, Indiana Child Welfare Improvement Committee ( CWIC ) intends the Legal Orphan project (including its PRT+ initiative) to identify permanency options sooner for difficult -to-place children in stuck cases. CWIC believes that doing so will have a long -term impact on time to permanency in adoption cases. This is a critical piece to the PRT process within the department, where concurrent planning is a focus. This is a project that DCS is workin g on through the Court Improveme nt Project (CIP). DCS also intends to monitor the utilizati on of kinship placement options as it launches the Kinship Navigator Program, as well as post adoption services and consistent with its goals related to continuous quality improvement, will identify and implement strategies to further improve outcomes based on data trends. In 2017, DCS engaged consultants from Katz Sapper and Miller (KSM) to build a permanency model that identifies cases that are close to permanency or should have already achieved permanency to see what characteristics the cases have in common. After identifying commonalities, DCS will wo rk to develop strategies to minimize the number of cases not achieving permanency timely, specifically as it applies to the Permanency in 12 months (12 -23 months & 24+ months). The Permanency Outlier tool is currently being utilized in r egions 3, 4, 5, 9, and 14 . 3. Goal, Strategies and Objectives Related to Well -Being GOAL 3: ENGAGEMENT \u2014STRENGTHEN ENGAGEMENT WITH PARENTS, CHILDREN, YOUTH AND RESOURCE FAMILIES (F OSTER/RELATIVE/KINSH IP/ADOPTIVE). Indiana Child Welfare System results on this indicator were at 38% at the time of the CFSR in summer of 2016. Quality engagement with families and a lack of access to services has been a concern to having well- being outcomes be within substantial compliance limits. When parents (or caregivers) do not engage with DCS , DCS should do a better job of continually reaching out to parents to engage them in services and visits. One of the ways DCS can ensure communication with parents is to make sure DCS is visiting with the mother and father at regular intervals. The reasons for DCS not having a sufficient number of quality visits with parents or caregivers 92 is unclear. In reviewing contacts between the FCM and children on their caseload, DCS has found a high rate of completed visits with children. DCS does not see a correspo nding link to visits occurring between children, their parents, and their siblings. DCS needs to better understand the root cause of the lack of visitation between children, pa rents/caregivers, and siblings. In order to do so, DCS will measure contacts, bo th qualitatively and quantitatively, to determine what could support the improvement of documentation of visitation as well as increasing the quality and quantity of visits among family members. In regards to the DCS Practice Model, the Child Welfare Policy and Practice Group (\"CWG \") noted: \"DCS should reclaim the family -centered practice model that it adopted shortly after its formation. This will require: (1) a return to valuing and consistently soliciting and using the input of families and their suppo rt systems both in ongoing casework and in regular child and family team meetings; (2) learning to recognize and mobilize family protective factors that can help promote child safety even when some safety threats exits; (3) achieving an understanding of th e harmful effects of child removal and disrupted attachment for children as a counterbalance in considering whether removal is the safest course of action to address safety threats; and (4) increasing both the number and skill level of peer practice coaches available to staff.\" Indiana has committed to a renewed focus of the DCS Practice Model that would improve key areas such as quality visits, formal and informal assessments, and case planning. There were many factors that explain why the Practice Model was not at the forefront of DCS practice. Among those factors are an increased FCM workload, increased and significant turnover at varying levels of the child welfare agency, and an institutional lack of focus on the foundation and basics of excellent social work practice. Indiana DCS has a number of areas that hold regular and effective Child and Family Team Meetings (\"CFTM\") , which is a cornerstone of the DCS Practice Model, in order to increase family engagement in their cases. In areas that are doing well in regards to effective teaming, Indiana DCS will determine the factors that lead to success through the CFTM process and replicate those factors in other areas. With a re -dedication to the Practice Model, Indiana looks to improve the culture of the ag ency by focusing on the four (4) core values found in the Practice Model : genuineness, empathy , respect and professionalism. Indiana believes that to fully refocus on the Practice Model, and implement a culture of change, the renewed focus must begin from the top down. Practice Model training with Field management began on December 5, 2017 (after the on -site CFSR) when DCS Supervisors participated in a \u00bd day training entitled \"Leading Practice\", a re-introduction to Indiana's Practice Model. In addition, D CS executive staff participated in a similar training in the latter part of 2018. Additional training for Family Case Managers will be conducted and completed by July 1, 2019. Having fidelity to the Practice Model will assist children, families, and youth to have better outcomes after their involvement in the child welfare system. Additionally, substance use is having a major impact on families. The timeline to reunification is complicated and delayed by the relapse and recovery cycles of substance users. In 2017, a significant number of removals were related to parental substance abuse. Indiana has instituted a workgroup to address Plans of Safe Care for infants and caregivers affected by substance use. Indiana worked on the expansion of scalable START principles 93 statewide wi th Casey Family Programs throughout 2018. The START principles include, but are not limited to, quick access to substance abuse assessment and initiation of treatment as well as a peer recovery model. OBJECTIVE 3.1 REDEDICATE ALL L EVELS OF THE AGENCY TO THE USE OF THE DCS PRACTICE MODEL AND USE OF ITS FIVE (5) CORE SKILLS, TEA MING, ENGAGING, ASSE SSING, PLANNING, AND INTERV ENING (\"TEAPI\"). THESE ALSO SET THE TONE FOR SUCCESSFUL ENGAGEMEN T BY DCS IN DEVELOPI NG TRUST -BASED RELATIONSHIP S WITH CHILDREN, FAMIL IES, AND STAKEHOLDERS. SIMILARLY, DCS FOCUSES ON THESE STANDARDS WHEN ENGAGED WITH CO- WORKERS AS A SIGN OF MUTUAL RESPECT, TRUST AND SUPPORT FOR FELLOW TE AM MEMBERS. a) Implement a strategic rollout that clearly defines how each position in the organization plays a vital role in the implementation of the DCS Practice Model. (i) With there being DCS leaders new to the agency, many executives may not be as familiar with the DCS Practice Model. To establish buy -in at the executive level, DC S will initially dedicate an Executive Staff Meeting solely to the practice model. Thereafter, DCS will schedule a retreat/seminar for Executive Staff and Regional Managers. (ii) LODs and Local Office Attorneys (LOAs) will be trained on the importance and consistent use of the DCS Practice Model. (iii) Central Office staff will be trained on the importance and consistent use of the DCS Practice Model. Central office staff must understand the role they play in supporting the agency and enhancing the work of the FCM. (iv) Supervisors will be trained via a Quarterly Supervisor Workshop. (v) Family Case Managers will receive additional support about the importance and use of the Practice Model. LODs and FCM Supervisors will provide such guidance to FCMs on a continual basis. (vi) For employees who are un able to attend the initial face to face trainings, annual trainings will be available, as needed, for employees to attend to receive this important information in person.

The Permanency and Practice Support division employees clinical services specialists, investigators and education liaisons. In an effort to better support parents who have substance use as a factor in involvement in the child welfare system, DCS will partner with the IOCS to determine whether the expansion of Family Recovery Courts will assist in improving engagement for families. Family Recovery Courts (\"FRC\") apply a non -adversarial, collaborative approach and utilize a multidisciplinary team including a judge, DCS attorney, defense attorneys, case- managers, CASA/GALs and treatment providers. FRCs specifically target cases of child abuse or neglect wherein the parent or primary caregiver suffers from a substance use disorder and/or co -occurring disorders. On August 1, 2018 the IOCS and DCS, in partnership with the Center for Children and Family Futures and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, sponsored a Family Recovery Court Best Practices Training. Fifteen counties were represented by teams comprised of judges, magistrates, referees, DCS Attorneys, defense counsel representatives, DCS local office directo rs, treatment providers, probation officers and DCS family case managers. 4. Goal, Strategies, and Objectives Related to Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) GOAL 4: ENSURE SA FETY, PERMANENCY & W ELL-BEING FOR INDIANA'S FAMILIES B Y STRENGTHENING CONTIN UOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (C QI) EFFORTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. Continuous Quality Improvement (\"CQI\"), along with Indiana's modified Onsite Review Instrument (\"OSRI\") activities will continue to be strengthened in an effort to not only improve outcomes, but also im prove the culture and climate of the agency. Indiana will use information gathered through the CQI process and OSRI to work with staff, both executive and field, to note strengths and challenges, thus bringing the information full circle. Indiana recognizes that staff at all levels need to be engaged in CQI efforts on a regular and ongoing basis. DCS will support CQI by educating staff on CQI principles and ensuring their participation and input in CQI 105 projects is supported by all levels of the agency. DCS will work with Probation to enhance and support CQI practice for juvenile justice involved youth as well. CQI will continue to be strengthened through meaningfully created CQI projects developed at both divisional and the regional level using both quantitative and qual itative processes involving front line staff at the core of decision -making. CQI projects will be tracked through the Division of Strategic Solutions and Agency Transformation and the Strategic Solutions Coordinating Committee team within Indiana DCS and the outcomes from the projects will be reviewed on a regular basis with regional management as well as executive management. By engaging in thoughtful and consistent evaluation and discussion of CQI projects, DCS will assist children and families by determining whether they experienced better outcomes as a result of their involvement with child welfare. In places where the Practice Model is thriving, Indiana intends to review the systemic factors improving performance in those areas in an att empt to replicate those trends in other areas of the State needing improvement. Indiana will empower its workforce to communicate when a policy or practice is not working as intended so a CQI project can be created to identify, evaluate, and address underlying needs.

DCS has s uccessfully m ade steps implem enting CQI into its org anizational structure and the agencies 110 commitment to continuous quality improvement is highlighted as it exists as one of the pillars presented by the Director. DCS hopes to continue integra tion of CQI by capturing additional dat a, streamlining reports, implem enting data modelling, and oards to facilitat e more real- time dec ision- making and further analysis of progress on all of the CFSP goals and o bjectives. DCS remai n s and effici welfar e servic es through expanded eligibil ity and a broader serv ice array. DCS has r outinel y monitored the effec tiveness of th e Practice Model in order to estab lish the goals and d irecti on of the agency, Title IV-E Waiver spen ding, training , and servi ce de livery . To further sup port these efforts, DCS has implemented a Continuous Qual ity Improvem ent (CQI) process that will serv e as th e foundation for setti ng ag ency priorities, s tructure f or nd e xterna l collaborations, and interv DCS ng a sustainable CQI approach that will serv e as the ba sis for evaluating and improvi ng child welfare practi ce and using data analytics to inform targeted and timely interventions for children and families to improve safety, permanency and well- being outcomes. By engaging in thoughtful and consistent evaluation and discussion of CQI projects, DCS will assist children and f amilies by determining whether they experienced better outcomes as a result of their involvement with child welfare. In places where the Practice Model is thriving, Indiana intends to review the systemic factors improving performance in those are as in an attempt to replicate those trends in other areas of the State needing improvement. Indiana will empower its workforce to communicate when a policy or practice is not working as intended so a CQI project can be created to identify, evaluate, and address underlying needs. 5. Goal, Strategies, and Objectives related to Workforce C onsiderations GOAL 5: WORKFORCE \u2014IMPLEMENT INITIATIVE S THAT FOCUS ON IMPR OVING CLIMATE AND CULTURE AT ALL LEVEL S OF THE AGENCY THAT LEAD TO BETTER OUTCO MES FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES AND IMPROVED WORKER RECRUITMENT A ND RETENTION. Indiana understands meaningful improvement is most likely to be successful with a strong and stable workforce. DCS will leverage the PIP to implement strategies based off of data DCS has already accumu lated and to put in place activities to improve worker recruitment and retention. The below table represents the retention and stability of the workforce at the following job classifications: family case manager (\"FCM\"), family case manager supervisor, division manager, and FCM trainee. This data illustrates that FCM Supervisors are relatively stable with an average of 6.68 years as a supervisor and a median of 4 years. 111 In the summer of 2017, DCS committed to enhancing our clinical supervision framework with our field staff. Regional managers, local office directors, and family case manager supervisors received training on better ways to support practice with clinical supervision on a consistent basis. As the quality of clinical supervision increases, DCS believes that practice will improve because we will have better outcome measures related to face -to-face visits, completion of safety and risk assessments, and the timely completion of case plans. With the increase in quality clinical supervision, DCS thinks this will better support our workforce and increase retention. Since the implementation and training of the clinical supervision framework to staff, DCS has found that negative turnover has decr eased from 15.8% in July 2017 to 14.6% in July 2018. 2 Please note, this table does not account for the amount of time an employee has been at DCS. This data reflects only the amount of time an individual has been in their current classification. For example, Suzy was a FCM Supervisor for thr ee years and then became a Division Manager a year ago. Only Suzy's time in her current classification is reflected in the table. Her time as a FCM Supervisor is not accounted for in the FCM Supervisor data nor is the combined time of 3 years plus 1 year reflected in her current classification of Division Manager. Suzy only gets credit for 1 year as a Division Manager. Data is reflected of employees on May 4, 2018. Position2 Average of Months Average of Years Median of Years Family Case Manager 37.47 3.13 1.89 FCM Trainee 0.14 0.15 112 supervision standard is one supervisor to seven FCMs compared to the national standard of one supervisor to five FCMs. Therefore, DCS has made a concerted effort to hire more FCM Supervisors in the past year. DCS recognizes that having a manageable number of staff to supervise will improve the ability of supervisors to provide quality clinical supervision. As of April 18, 2017, DCS employed a total of 345 supervisors. As of August 23 , 2018, DCS employed 364 supervisors3 within its workforce and the Supervisor -to-FCM ratio was 6.02. Indiana recognizes FC Ms are able to provide better case management to children and families when they have manageable caseloads and clinical supervision. DCS has significant internal data on workforce, but also has access to exit interviews from the Human Resources Department within the State Personnel Department, along with data from surveys conducted by Indiana University (\"IU\"). The information from these data points will aid in the improvement and retention of DCS's workforce. DCS is committed to reviewing the available so urces of data to continuously inform and focus workforce retention efforts. Indiana reviewed data from Employee Exit Surveys that were completed from 2012 to 2018. DCS received 1,663 responses to the survey. Upon leaving employment, employees were asked f or the top three reasons for leaving DCS (employees were required to choose three reasons). The options that are given include: work climate, lack of appreciation/recognition, secured a different job, working conditions, type of work, supervision, return t o school, retirement, illness or physical condition, family circumstances, job pressure/work -related stress, promotional opportunities, inadequate training, salary/benefits, and other. The top reasons for leaving DCS employment Reason Number of Respo nses (n=1,663) Job pressure/Work -related stress 793 3 A supervisor in this context is one that supervises FCMs that carry an active caseload. 113 Working Conditions (workload, schedule, etc.) 728 Secured a Different Job4 598 Salary/Benefits (health, dental, and vision) 434 Indiana recognizes child welfare is challenging and difficult work that can lead to high stress and challenges in balancing work and life. Indiana offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) that can help employees in a number of areas (both professionally and personally), including but not limited to, finding child care or e lder care resources, legal aid, and counseling services. Indiana also has a Critical Incident Response Team (\"CIRT\") that is available when there are critical incidents that staff are involved in at a local office level. For example, a CIRT Team can be requested when there are any of the following: death of a child, near -fatality of a child, threat of harm, death of a parent on the caseload, death of a co -workers, or cumulative stress (multiple incidents in several weeks). Indiana will re -visit employee res ources with staff to ensure they are encouraged to use these resources and are addressing work -life balance needs. In reviewing the current Employee Exit Survey, Indiana noted a number of opportunities for improvement to the survey in order to determine, with a degree of confidence, the underlying reasons that employees are exiting from DCS. As part of the PIP, Indiana will improve the current Employee Exit Survey. Indiana recognizes the need for better data in order to understand the underlying cause that is driving employees to leave the agency. Only when DCS understands the underlying issue, will Indiana be able to prevent employee exits. DCS recognizes the limitations of the current Employee Exit survey, which looks at why people are leaving the agency. This inquiry occurs after the decision to leave has already been made. Therefore, Indiana will develop a New Employee Survey (for employees who have been with the agency less than one year) and an Experienced Employee Survey (for employees who have been wi th the agency for at least one year). Indiana will administer the New Employee Survey at defined intervals during the first year of employment with DCS in an effort to understand why employees are leaving during their first year of employment. Indiana believes that the New Employee Survey will help identify issues with new employees and allow us to adapt to needs or improve processes before an employee decides to leave. The New Employee Survey will allow Indiana to focus on preventing the employee from leav ing the agency. The Experienced Employee Survey will be completed at least once per year and will help DCS understand the reasons why an employee choses to stay with the agency and 4 DCS notes that the response \"Secured a Different Job\" will likely be captured differently in the future. DCS would like to understand why employees are looking for other employment. 114 assist in understanding what improvements could be made at the agency to f urther promote employee retention efforts. OBJECTIVE 5 .1 DCS HAS DEDICATED RE SOURCES \u2014BOTH INTERNAL AND EX TERNAL \u2014TO COLLECTING DATA AND PERFORMING ANALYSIS ON STAFF RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. DCS WILL USE THOSE FINDINGS T O EXECUTE STRATEGIES THAT RESULTS IN IMPROVED RECRUITME NT AND RETENTION. a) Recruitment and retention needs vary widely around the state and as such, each DCS region will develop its own workforce recruitment and retention plans. (i) DCS will create and compile the regional recruitment and retention plans developed by regional field staff (supported by data and information from the regional and local level) to identify where trends or commonalities can be addressed. (ii) Once the regional recruitment and retention plans are compiled, DCS HR will review and develop a statewide plan in order to target workforce needs in order to inform a broader statewide targeted recruitment and retention strategy. Target Completion Date Current Status Progress to Date CB Comments Q2 (i) Q3 (ii) b) DCS HR and the Office of Information Technology will conduct and monitor new FCM cohort surveys to measure engagement of new employees during the employee's first year in a local office. Sample questions include how many times they have met with their sup ervisor, relationship with their mentor, have they had the ability to shadow, and their confidence in their decision to become a family case manager. (i) A new FCM cohort employee survey will be developed for employees who are in their first year of employment . (ii) Survey responses for the New FCM Employee Survey will be captured at defined intervals. An analysis will be provided to executive level staff once per quarter and executive level staff will review and address trends as needed.

Q1 (iii)Ongoing Implementation Executive staff have established practice model expectations with each of their divisions. Continuous use of the parallel process will continue. Q1 (iv)Completed This was delivered during a supervisor quarterly workshop and completed in De cember of 2017. 6. PIP Implementation Plan and Supports DCS has planned, and is prepared, to rollout trainings and informational sessions throughout the state in order to communicate the PIP to child welfare stakeholders. DCS will utilize regional trainings, which will result in DCS management (local office directors, supervisors, etc.) receiving information on how the PIP will be implemented. Furthermore, field management will receive instruction on how to message and implement the PIP to FCMs. Ultima tely, training will be delivered to all levels and divisions of the agency statewide. In regards to the rollout of information for juvenile justice, DCS will work in partnership with the Indiana Office of Court Services. The Indiana Office of Court Services will be offering a variety of trainings for both new and experienced probation officers on PIP implementation and strategies to improve juvenile justice practice. Indiana worked closely with the Children Bureau's Measurement and Sampling Committee to develop a measurement plan that utilizes a thorough case review method and practice appraisal process that uses the 118 OSRI. The practice appraisal process uses a modified version of the OSRI tool to measure practice during the current review year. Indiana will allocate the resources necessary to execute a statewide case review that will result in a baseline and semi- annual PIP measurement during years 1 and 2, consisting of a random selection of 65 cases during each semi -annual review period. Lastly, the Eckerd feedback model identifies cases for review by identifying common risk factors seen in highest risk situations. Eckerd has developed a \"dashboard\" for a review team in Indiana to use predictive analytics that identifies children who have certain case characteristics which demonstrate a high probability of repeat maltreatment. The review team ensures there is targeted case follow- up and monitoring. DCS believes this program will assist in determining whether a case is a high risk for safety issues and, by extension, repeat maltreatment. V. SERVICE S A. CHILD AND FAMILY SER VICES CONTINUUM (45 CFR 1357.15(N)) DCS provides a full continuum of services state -wide. Those services can be categorized in the following manner: 119 1. Prevention Services Kids First Trust Fund A member of the National Alliance of Children's Trusts, Indiana raises funds through license plate sales, filing fee surcharges, and contributions. This fund was created by Indiana statute and is overseen by a Board of Directors appointed by the State Senate, State House of Representatives and Indiana Governor. DCS and the Indiana Department of Health also have representatives on the Board. The Board is required to meet at least quarterly. The purpose of the trust fund includes the p revention of child abuse and neglect as well as reducing infant mortality. The Board is supportive of DCS efforts to develop a strategic framework and toolkit on the prevention of child abuse and neglect. The goal for this project is for the toolkit on pre vention to be completed and available by early 2021. PreventionHealthy Families Indiana Community Partners for Child Safety Youth Service Bureaus Project Safe Place Children's Mental Health Initiative Kids First Trust Fund Preservation and Reunification ServicesHome Based Services Counseling, Psychological and Psychiatric Services Treatment for Substance Use Disorders Domestic Violence Services Services for Children Services for Parents Global Services PEDS program Placement ServicesKinship Care Foster Care Group Homes Residential Care Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities State Operated Facilities Aftercare ServicesPost Adoption Services Voluntary Older Youth Services 120 Youth Service Bureau Youth Service Bureaus were created by Indiana statute for the purpose of funding delinquency prevention programs through a state -wide network. This fund supports 24 Youth Service Bureaus to provide a range of programs including: Teen Court, Mentoring, Recreation Activities, Skills Training, Counseling, Shelter, School Intervention, and Parent Education. Project Safe Place This fund, created by Indiana statute, provi des a state- wide network of safe places for children to report abuse, neglect, and runaway status. These safe places are public places like convenience stores, police departments, fire departments and other places where children gather. Some emergency shelter is also funded through licensed emergency shelter agencies. Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) Federal funds available through the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) via Community Based Child Abuse Prevention (CBCAP) funding support building a community -based child abuse prevention network through which prevention services can be delivered. Healthy Families Indiana (HFI) A combination of federal, state, and local fund ing provides prevention home visiting services through contract s with the 32 local HFI providers to parents of children zero to three years old. The purpose is to promote healthy families and healthy children through a variety of services including child d evelopment, access to health care, and parent education. The program also advocates for positive, nurturing, non -violent discipline of children. See the Healthy Families Indiana web page, https://www.in.gov/d cs/2459.htm . Community Partners for Child Safety (CPCS) The purpose of this service is to develop a child abuse prevention service array that can be delivered in every region of the state. This service builds community resources that promote support to fa milies identified through self- referral or other community agency referral to a service that will connect families to the resources needed to strengthen the family and prevent child abuse and neglect. It is intended, through the delivery of these preventio n services, that the need for referral to Child Protective Services will not be necessary. Community resources include, but are not limited to: schools, social services agencies, local DCS offices, Healthy Families Indiana, Prevent Child Abuse Indiana Cha pters, Youth Services Bureaus, Child Advocacy Centers, the faith -based community, local school systems and Twelve Step Programs. See the Community Partners for Child Safety web page, https://www.in.gov/dcs/2 455.htm . 121 Maternal Infant Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Maternal Infant Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) funds are designed to: (1) strengthen and improve the programs and activities carried out under Title V of the Social Security Act; (2) improve coordination of services for at -risk communities; and (3) identify and provide comprehensive services to improve outcomes for families who reside in at -risk communities. The Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) and the Department of Child Services (DCS) are co -leads of this federal grant, collaborate with Public Consulting Group, Goodwill Industries of Central Indiana, Riley Child Development Center, Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and the Early Learning Advisory Council (ELAC) Initiative at the state agency level to achieve MIECHV goals. The Indiana MIECHV funding supports direct client service through the expan sion of two evidenced -based home visiting programs, Healthy Families Indiana (HFI) and Nurse Family Partnerships (NFP), to pair families \u2014 particularly low -income, single -parent families \u2014with trained professionals who can provide parenting information, reso urces and support during a woman's pregnancy and throughout a child's first few years of life. These models have been shown to make a real difference in a child's health, development, and ability to learn and include supports such as health care, screenings for developmental concerns , early education, parenting skills, child abuse prevention, and nutrition education or assistance. For more information about MIECHV Indiana visit: https://www.in.gov/isdh/25565 .htm . Children's Mental Health Initiative The Children's Mental Health Initiative (CMHI) provides service access for children with significant mental and behavioural health issues who have historically been unable to access high level services. The Children's Mental Health Initiative specifically focuses on those children and youth who do not qualify for Medicaid services and whose families are struggling to access services due to their inability to pay for the services or find gaps in the service array. T he CMHI helps to ensure that children are served in the most appropriate service delivery system and that they do not enter the child welfare system or probation system for the sole purpose of accessing mental and/or behavio ral health services. The Children's Mental Health Initiative is a collaboration between DCS and the local Access Sites, Community Mental Health Center 's and the Division of Mental Health and Addiction. Available services include: Rehabilitation Option Services, Clinic Based T herapeutic and Diagnostic Services, Children's Mental Health Wraparound Services, Wraparound Facilitation, Habilitation, Family Support and Training, Respite (overnight respite must be provided by a DCS licensed provider), and Placement Services. 122 Eligibility for the CMHI can be more flexible than that of Medicaid paid services under the Children's Mental Health Wraparound and includes: DSM -IV-TR Diagnosis - Youth meets criteria for two (2) or more diagnoses. CANS 4, 5, or 6 and DMHA/DCS Project Algo rithm must be a 1 Child or adolescent age 6 through the age of 17 Youth who are experiencing significant emotional and/or functional impairments that impact their level of functioning at home or in the community (e.g., Seriously Emotionally Disturbed classification) Not Medicaid Eligible/Lack funding for service array Other children who have been approved by DCS to receive services under the Children's Mental Health Initiative because they are a danger to themselves or others Note: The Children's Mental Health Initiative is a voluntary service. The caregiver must be engaged in order to access services. The CMHI started as a pilot project in 2012 and has spread throughout Indiana in 2013 and early 2014. The program has shown success and is still running in collaboration with DMHA. The CMHI and the Family Evaluation process were implemented jointly to improve service access to families without requiring entry into the probation system or the child welfare system in order to access services. 2. Preservation and Reunification Services DCS will continue to provide a full service array throughout the state. Services provided to families will include a variety of services outlined below. 123 124 These services are provided according to service standards foun d at: http://www.in.gov/dcs/3159.htm Future service enhancements include continued expansion of the home -based service array. Services currently available under the array include: 125 Family Preservation Service The Family Preservation Service standard is a new standard and delivery of services for the state of Indiana. Secondary to the Families First Prevention Service Act that was signed into Federal Law in February of 2018, this standard was being developed to address the need to give families and children available services in their homes to prevent the need of placement in foster care. The service provides a per diem to the referred agency to provide \"any and all\" needed services to the family to allow the children to remain safely in the family home. The minimum requirements are that the provider agency meet with the focus child(ren), in the child(ren) home at least on a weekly basis. The provider agency will need to utilize Evidence Based Practices and follow the models that they use for frequency, needs, and supervision. The per diem also includes concrete funds to assist the family.

Some evidence based models require a therapist to provide home based clinical services and treatment. These services are provided by one agency. This is referable through service mapping or the Regional Services Coordinator Maximum case load of 5 -8. Comprehensive Home- Based Services Comprehensive Home -Based Services include an array of home based services provided by a single provider agency. All providers offering services through this standard are required to utilize an Evidence Based Practice (EBP) model in service implementation, which include but is not limited to, Motivational interviewing, Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Child Parent Psychotherapy. In addition, Family Centered Treatment is being supported by DCS as a model of Comprehensive Home -Based Services. This service provides i ntensive therapeutic services to families with children at risk of placement or to support the family in transitioning the child from residential placement back to the family. This model also is 127 effective in working with families who have very complex need s. The service works to implement sustainable value change that will improve life functioning and prevent future system involvement. Services Available Through Comprehensive Home Based Services Service Standard Target Population Service Summary FCT - Family Centered Therapy Families that are resistant to services Families that have had multiple, unsuccessful attempts at home based services Traditional services that are unable to successfully meet the underlying need Families that have experienced family violence Families that have previous DCS involvement High risk juveniles who are not responding to typical community based services Juveniles who have been found to need residential placement or are returning from incarceratio n or residential placement This program offers an average of 6 months of evidenced based practice that quickly engages the entire family (family as defined by the family members) through a four phase process. The therapist works intensively with the family to help them understand what their values are and helps motivate them to a sustainable value change that will improve the lives of the whole family. MI - Motivational Interviewing effective in facilitating many types of behavior change addictions non -compliance and running away of teens discipline practices of parents. This program offers direct, client -centered counseling approaches for therapists to help clients/families clarify and resolve their ambivalence about change. Motivational Interviewing identifies strategies for practitioners including related tasks for the clients within each stage of change to minimize and overcome resistance. This model has been shown to be effective in facilitating many types of behavior change including addi ctions, non -compliance, running away behaviors in teens, and inappropriate discipline practices of parents. 128 TFCBT - Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Trauma Assessments Children ages 3 -18 who have experienced trauma Children who may be experiencing significant emotional problems Children with PTSD This program offers treatment of youth ages 3 -18 who have experienced trauma. The treatment includes child -parent sessions, uses psycho education, parenting skills, stress management, cognitive coping, etc. to enhance future safety. Treatment assists the family in working through trauma in order to prevent future behaviors related to trauma, and a non -offending adult caregiver must be available to participate in services. AFCBT - Alternative Family Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Children diagnosed with behavior problems Children with Conduct Disorder Children with Oppositional Defiant Disorder Families with a history of physical force and conflict This program offers treatment t o improve relationships between children and parents/caregivers by strengthening healthy parenting practices. In addition, services enhance child coping and social skills, maintains family safety, reduces coercive practices by caregivers and other family m embers, reduces the use of physical force by caregivers and the child and/ or improves child safety/welfare and family functioning. ABA - Applied Behavioral Analysis Children with a diagnosis on the Autism Spectrum This program offers treatment for youth with autism diagnosis to improve functional capacity in speech and language, activities of daily living, repetitive behaviors and intensive intervention for development of social and academic skills. CPP - Child Parent Psychotherapy Children ages 0-5 who have experienced trauma Children who have been victims of maltreatment Children who have witnessed DV Children with attachment disorders Toddlers of depressed mothers This program offers techniques to support and strengthen the caregiver a nd child relationship as an avenue for restoring and protecting the child's mental health, improve child and parent domains, and increase the caregiver's ability to interact in positive ways with the child(ren). This model is based on attachment theory but integrates other behavioral therapies. IN-AJSOP Children with sexually maladaptive behaviors and their families This program offers treatment to youth who have exhibited inappropriate sexually aggressive behavior. The youth may be reintegrating into the community following out -of-home placement for treatment of sexually maladaptive behaviors. Youth may have sexually maladaptive behaviors and co - occurring mental health, intellectual disabilities or autism spectrum diagnoses. CBT -IN-AJSOP focuses on skill development for youth, family members and members of the community to manage and reduce risk. Youth and families learn specific skills including the identification of 129 distorted thinking, the modification of beliefs, the practice of pro social skills, and the changing of specific behaviors Intercept Children of any age with serious emotional and behavioral problems Treatment is family -centered and includes strength -based interventions, including family therapy using multiple evidence based models (EBM), mental health treatment for caregivers, parenting skills education, educational interventions, and development of positive peer groups. CBT- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Children and adults Depression Anxiety Cognitive distortions Unlearn negative emotional and behavioral reactions This program offers approaches to assist clients in facilitating many types of behavior change including cognitive distortions which tend to reinforce feelings of anger and self-defeat. CBT is based on the premise that negative emotional and behavioral reactions are learned, and the goal of therapy sessions are to help unlearn these unwanted reactions and learn new ways of reacting. This model has been proven effective with youth and adults who have significant depression or anxiety, those who lack motivation, and those who need mental health treatment to safely change behavior. It can assist parents who appear to be unmotivated in taking initiative on behalf of their children, largely due to history and pattern of being a victim of childhood neglect/abuse, dysfunctional family patterns, domestic violence, or sexual assault. In addition, it can also be effective in addressing inappropriate discipline, and assisting with children who are noncompliant, have learning disabilities, social anxiety or bullying behaviors Sobriety Treatment and Recovery Teams DCS utilizes principles from a promising practice program that has shown very positive outcomes with families in Kentucky. The program combines a specially trained Family Case Manager, Family Mentor, and Treatment Coordinator to serve families where there are children under the age of 5 and the parent struggles with a substance use disorder. The Family Mentor is someone who has had history with the child welfare system and is currently in recovery. The program continues to be implemented in Monroe County. Currently there are two activ e Family Case Managers, two Family Mentor and one Treatment Coordinator in Monroe County. A decision was made to not expand to other sites but to use resources to expand START principles statewide. In late 2018 the Department began START Principles trainings, two trainings were offered in different areas of the state in 2018, since then two additional trainings have been offered in 2019, with plans for two more at the end of the calendar year. The trainings are intentionally structured to bring both child welfare staff and treatment staff together, as the START model prioritizes cross- system collaboration. These trainings also focus on current 130 research -based best practices (Medication -Assisted Treatment, quick access to treatment, intensive services with r elapse planning that doesn't involve automatic removal from treatment or automatic removals of children, usage of peer supports, etc.). Trauma Assessments, TF -CBT DCS recently expanded the service array to include Trauma Assessments and Bonding and Attach ment Assessments. Trauma Assessments will be provided to appropriate children, using at least one standardized clinical measure to identify types and severity of trauma symptoms. Bonding and Attachment Assessments will use the Boris direct observation protocol. These new assessments will provide recommendations for appropriate treatment. Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF -CBT) is a model that is utilized by providers. DCS has trained approximately 500 clinicians throughout the state to provide TF-CBT. These clinicians are employed by Community Mental Health Centers, residential treatment providers (for youth), and community -based providers. This large number of clinicians trained by DCS will expand the availability of TF -CBT and will ensure that TF -CBT is available for children and families in need. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender or Questioning (LGBTQ) Services Community Based/Prevention providers have clauses in their contract with DCS which contain assurances that include the following mandate: \"In order to improve outcomes for LGBTQ youth, service providers will provide a culturally competent, safe, and supportive environment for all youth regardless of sexual orientation. All staff must be sensitive to the sexual and/or gender orien tation of the family members, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or questioning (LGBTQ) children/youth. Services to youth who identify as LGBTQ must also be provided in accordance with the principles in the Indiana LGBTQ Practice Guidebook. Staff will use neutral language, facilitate a trust based environment for disclosure, and will maintain appropriate confidentiality for LGBTQ youth. a. The LGBTQ Practice Guidebook http://www.in.gov/dcs/files/GuidebookforBestPracticeswithLGBTQYouth.pdf and LGBTQ Computer Assisted Training (CAT) are both available online. b. All DCS child welfare service agencies are required to have all of their new staff understand the information in the LGBTQ Practice Guidebook within 30 days of start date. The Guidebook is located at: http://www.in.gov/dcs/files/LGBTQPracticeGuidebookFinalforOnlineViewing.pdf c. All DCS child welfare service agencies are required to have all of their new staff complete the LGBTQ Computer Assisted Training (CAT) within 30 days of start date. The training is located at: 131 http://childwelfare.iu.edu/cat/DCS09030/ . The providers are requir ed to track completion of the training requirement on an on -going basis and completion is verified during a DCS contract audit. Providers required to comply with the above are: Cross -Systems (CSCC) Community Partners (CP) Home -Based Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC's) Older Youth Services (OYS) Healthy Families Indiana (HFI) Specific Services/Programming: Home -Based Services Extra Special Parents (Regions 7, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18): Groups and home -based casework for LGBTQ Youth Older Youth Services: Indiana Youth Group (Regions 9, 10, 11, 12, 14). Broker services via community based program for youth who have self- identified LGBTQ and who are in need of additional supports. Program provides support, drop -in center programming and other re ferrals for youth enrolled. Foster Care DCS will continue to provide access to foster homes throughout the state. Foster homes are licensed through DCS and through licensed child placing agencies. More detailed information can be found in the Foster and Adoptive Parent Licensing, Recruitment, and Retention section. Kinship Care DCS remains committed to securing the most family -like setting for a child when removal from the home occurs. DCS will first consider placing a child with an appropriate noncustodial parent. If placement with a noncustodial parent is not possible, DCS will look to relatives. DCS changed statute effective July 2014, to include in the definition of \"relative,\" \"any other individual with whom a child has an established and significant relationship.\" DCS currently has designated Relative Support Specialists that are charged with supporting crisis need of kinship, stabilizing family systems when the addition of a child is accepted and identifying concrete supports and community networks kin need to improve the conditions of children in their care. 132 Indiana DCS appl ied for and received the Kinship Navigator Grant in 2018. As DCS utilizes the Kinship Navigator Grant dollars, a more uniform assessment will be adopted to ensure that kinship planning can be measured in improvement for safety, stability, well- being and permanency of youth in that setting. Among those efforts is that the Indiana Department of Child Services is establishing a centralized method for working with and offering services to relative and kinship placements. Indiana has identified that an evaluati on of the centralized method will help support continuous quality improvement frameworks and build an evidence base for the continued use of this framework. Funds from the Kinship Navigator Grant will be used to establish a centralized infrastructure, set of policies, and standardized practice and procedures when delivering support to kinship and relative placements. Additionally, DCS will support training of staff on a family assessment tool, motivational interviewing techniques, as well as an evaluation o f the program. The Indiana DCS will continue to develop a website containing community resources for kinship families. This website will include information on state and federal benefits available to kinship families as well as community service providers that families may determine to be useful. This page will be included on a site that provides information for licensed foster parents, so kinship caregivers are aware of possible additional resources, should they choose to become licensed. The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (\"FSSA\") develops, finances, and administers programs to provide healthcare and social services to individuals in Indiana. DCS is partnering with FSSA in order to establish a referral system for relative and kinship families. The goal of this referral program will be to establish quick and consistent access to government aid for relative and kinship families to utilize. These services include financial, medical, and child care services that families may be eligible for due to placement of a child in kinship care. Adoption Services See Services Description, Adoption Promotion and Support Services below for additional information on the types of Adoption Services provided. Independent Living: Older Youth Services The service array for Independent Living is described in detail in Section XII , the Chafee Program. B. SERVICE DESCRIPTION (45 CFR 1 357.15(O )) DCS has built an extensive network of Federal, State, local and private partnerships and collaborations to support child maltreatment and prevention programs and activities. The DCS Prevention Team and the Community Partners for Child Safety contracted providers build on these efforts to promote and support families by connecting families with a continuum of services and resources needed to strengthen the family and prevent child abuse and neglect. 133 More specifically, federal funds awarded to Indiana and the extensive collaboration and coordination between State agencies, both directly and in -directly, result in the following partnerships, ultimately supporting communities and families at the local level. 1. Indiana State Department of Health The Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) houses a number of divisions that receive federal funding to administer several programs that are vital to families and children in Indiana. At the state level, a number of partnerships have been formed between DCS and ISDH in an effort to better coordinate federal and state resources. State wide Safe Sleep Program There is continued forward movement on the coordination of safe sleep education and outreach efforts as well as the formal Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) through which the providers become crib distribution sites for the Safe Sleep program in their local communities. The Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) has several partnerships with community organizations and have increased th e distribution sites that cover the entire state. DCS has purchased Infant Survival Kits for families with an infant at risk for SIDS or sleep -related death. The kits, which include one infant portable crib aka Pack N' Play (PNP), a fitted sheet with safe sleep message printed on it, a wearable blanket, a pacifier and printed safe sleep recommendations) are provided to families in need, upon request. In partnership with ISDH and internal and external stakeholders, this program has been implemented across t he state of Indiana. As a result of this collaboration, additional cribs have been distributed to parents since the First Candle National Crib Campaign began in 2008. As the program advanced, it became apparent that the crib distribution and delivery of the safe sleep education needed to be monitored and recorded to measure outcomes. Demographic information is collected on the recipients of the kits, as well as noting what staff person completed the safe sleep education. Prior to the onset of this collab oration, there were 100+ distribution sites across the State. With a network this large, it was difficult to obtain accurate demographic information. This led to the revamping of the program through a series of phases. The number of distribution sites was decreased to 23 regional locations during the initial phase. This helped provide a more manageable network through which we could ensure accurate tracking of kit distribution and compliance with the submission of demographic information. Determination o f distribution site location was assisted by the geographic boundaries set for the 18 DCS regions. Consistent tracking systems were developed and implemented and the distribution sites are adjusting to reporting timely outcomes. On May 18, 2015, oversigh t for the Safe Sleep Collaborative at ISDH moved from the Maternal and Child Health Division to the Indiana State Child Fatality Review Program. This change in oversight was made because infant safe sleep environment is so closely tied to child fatality re view, and will provide consistent and ongoing support for the ISDH Safe Sleep Coordinator. 134 The second phase of this collaboration was to work closely with the distribution sites to develop organization and oversight. The Safe Sleep Coordinator accomplished this task by providing consistent and uniform guidance on best practices for distribution, education and the collection of reportable information. This level of management improved accountability for both the distribution sites and the program coordin ators. It helped track to whom the kits were being disbursed and whether or not they were also receiving appropriate education. This systemic improvement helps us gather evidence -based data to determine the greatest areas of need. The third phase address ed the inconsistent education that caregivers were receiving with their kits. In an effort to standardize the messaging, the Safe Sleep Coordinator, in conjunction with the Indiana State Child Fatality Review Program, developed a webinar to \"Train the Trainer\" and instruct the distribution sites on what education components they should be offering to each kit recipient. These components include teaching the caregivers safe sleep practices for their infants, the importance of early and adequate prenatal care and avoiding tobacco and drug use while pregnant and/or caring for an infant. To date, over 530 Safe Sleep Educators have taken part in the training and received certificates of completion. Program Plans: The total number of Safe Sleep distribution sites has reached 141 and all 18 DCS regions are represented. The Child Fatality Review team will continue working with the Maternal & Child Health epidemiology team to address racial and economic disparity in sleep related deaths, actively seeking agencies in regions with high SUID (Sudden Unexplained Infant Death) rates to join the program, increase the quality of data collection in order to link the safe sleep data with the birth and death records, as well as the ongoing evaluation of the Safe Sleep Progra m. Moving forward, the continuation of this program will be handled solely by ISDH. OB Navigator Project As a key component of the overall strategy to reduce infant mortality, the cross -agency (ISDH, FSSA, and DCS) OB Navigator project is to plan, design, build, and implement a process/system that will enable early identification of pregnant women on Medicaid and referral into home visiting/navigator services, as well as with developing a Community Health Worker (CHW) model that will allow CHWs to be one of the home visiting/navigator options. An additional component of the project will be work to promote a cu lture that accepts and even expects home visiting/navigator services for all pregnant women. The project will include tracking of both process and outcome measures. To ensure the best possible outcomes, during the course of the project the team will identi fy and sponsor quality improvement projects. Key partners will include those organizations that currently provide home visiting or similar services, and to which we might hope to refer women: Nurse Family Partnership 135 Healthy Families Indiana Organizations with OB CHW programs Managed Care Entities The primary focus of 2020 will be initial build and implementation, with the primary focus in 2021 building and implementing enhancements. Maternal and Child Health (MCH): At the state level, MCH is funded in l arge part by the federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) Title V Block Grants. MCH also houses a number of projects, programs and services that are vital to the families and children served as DCS Prevention clients and/or those at risk for involv ement in DCS intervention services, as outlined in more detail below. Early Childhood Comprehensive System (ECCS) The purpose of the ECCS Impact program, which began in August 2016, is to enhance early childhood systems building and demonstrate improved outcomes in population -based children's developmental health and family well- being indicators using a Collaborative Innovation and Improvement Network (CoIIN) approach. An additional goal of the ECCS Impact grant is the development of collective impact expertise, implementation and sustainability of efforts at the state, county and community levels. The overall aim of this project is that within 60 months, the identified community will show a 25% increase from baseline in age appropriate developmental skills among their community's 3 year old children. Secondary aims include: Strengthen leadership and expertise in continuous quality improvement (CQI) and support innovation among state and community early childhood systems Achieve greater collective impact in early childhood systems at the state, county and community levels, with common aims, shared metrics and measurement systems, coordinated strategies, continuous communication, and a backbone organization at the state, county and community levels Develop primarily two -generation approaches to drive integration of early childhood services within and across sectors Develop and adopt a core set of indicators to measure Early Childhood system processes and outcome indicators that measure population impact around children's developmental health and family well- being Test innovative Early Childhood system change ideas, develop spread strategies and adopt new policies for sustaining the systems developed during this project that improve children's healthy development and family well- being 136 The stated goals will be achieved through the following activities: 1. Existing partnerships and collaborations 2. Integrating Help Me Grow into ISDH's MOMs H elpline 3. Sharing CoIIN activities and results 4. Facilitating Collective Impact at the state, county and community levels 5. Sustainability ISDH MCH is partnering with the Indianapolis Near Eastside and IndyEast Promise Zone, which is also a community receiving M aternal, Infant and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV), to participate in the ECCS CoIIN. Through this partnership, Indiana's ECCS Impact team and local community will receive intensive, targeted technical assistance from the National ECCS CoIIN Technical Assistance Center in order to develop collective impact expertise. In addition, ISDH/MCH proposes to contract with Help Me Grow National Center to receive technical support to expand and integrate the evidence -based model within the existing MCH MOMs Helpline. This integration will provide a centralized telephone access point for connecting children ages 0 -8 and their families to services and care coordination, child health care provider and community outreach to support early detection and intervention and data collection system. Help Me Grow Indiana The Indiana State Department of Health, in collaboration with the Indiana Department of Child Services, brought the Help Me Grow (HMG) model to Indiana. This model is a system approach to designing a comprehensive, integrated process for ensuring developmental promotion, early identification, referral, and linkage to early childhood resources and services. It reflects a set of best practices for designing and implementing a system that can optimally meet the needs of young children and families. It is specifically designed to help states organize and leverage existing resources in order to best serve families with children at -risk for developmental dela y. The model does not change or reinvent these programs and services, rather, it ensures collaboration among multiple systems to ensure access to services and seamless transitions for families. The Early Learning Advisory Committee, Child Development Well Being workgroup are key partners in the implementation piece of HMG. The Help Me Grow National Forum will be hosted in Indianapolis in May 2020. Early Learning Advisory Committee Established by the Indiana General Assembly i n 2013, the Early Learning Advisory Committee (ELAC) has membership that is appointed by the governor. The ELAC's responsibilities include: 1. Conducting periodic statewide needs assessments concerning quality and availability of early education programs for children from birth to the age of school entry, including the availability of high quality prekindergarten education for low income children in Indiana. 2. Identifying opportunities for and barriers to collaboration and coordination among federally and state 137 funded child development, child care, and early childhood education programs and services, including governmental agencies that administer programs and services. 3. Assessing capacity and effectiveness of two and four year public and private higher education institutions in Indiana for support and development of early educators including professional development and career advancement plans and practice or internships with pre-kindergarten programs. 4. Recommending to the Division procedures, policies, and eligibility criteria for the Early Education Matching Grant program. Maternal Infant Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) As stat ed previously, Maternal Infant Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) funds are designed to: (1) strengthen and improve the programs and activities carried out under Title V of the Social Security Act; (2) improve coordination of services for at -risk communities; and (3) identify and provide comprehensive services to improve outc omes for families who reside in at -risk communities. Indiana's Maternal Infant Early Childhood Home Visit ing (MIECHV) Innovation grant was to strengthen and improve the delivery of MIECHV funded home visiting programs through the coordination of communit y resources and early childhood systems such as child health, behavioral health and human services. Through this award, ISDH/MCH and Department of Child Services (DCS) expanded the services provided by the existing MCH MOMs Helpline and implement the evide nce-based approach of Help Me Grow (HMG), for the purpose of maximizing the continuum of services for women of child -bearing age through families with children. This will provide a centralized telephone access point for connecting families to services and care coordination; child health care providers and community outreach services to support early detection and intervention of developmental concerns ; and a data collection system that will inform gaps and barriers within these services. Indiana Home Visiti ng Advisory Board (INHVAB) In 2018 and 2019 the INHVAB and ECCS boards continued to meet together and have added the Help Me Grow Indiana pilot project to the scope of the board meetings. In May 2019 the INHVAB and ECCS board meeting included the Federal Project Officers for both MIECHV and ECCS as part of the Federal site visit to highlight the collaboration and cooperation between state and local partners. From the MIECHV site visit report: The INHVAB routinely explores opportunities for systems stren gthening. For example, the INHVAB is currently exploring the consequences of social determinants (including poverty) on child and adolescent health and well -being. Members will explore the role each member organization plays to address social determinants and then look for systems improvement opportunities. The board not only provides considerable strength to IN home visiting, but it also strengthens other early childhood organizations and the state system overall. The September 2019 meeting will have presentations on the OB Navigation project and social determinants of 138 health to discuss newly developed pilot projects in Indiana around home visiting and families' access to resources. From the MIECHV site visit report: The INHVAB routinely explores opportu nities for systems strengthening. For example, the INHVAB is currently exploring the consequences of social determinants (including poverty) on child and adolescent health and well -being. Members will explore the role each member organization plays to addr ess social determinants and then look for systems improvement opportunities. Late in 2019 the INHVAB and ECCS meeting will coordinate with Help Me Grow National to prepare for the May 2020 Help Me Grow Forum as Indiana will host the forum in downtown Ind ianapolis. Local Safe Sleep At the local level, the Safe Sleep Program Staff will continue to look for opportunities to establish a footprint in communities disproportionally affected by high SUID rates. The DOSETM (Direct On -Scene Education - an innov ative program to help eliminate sleep related infant death due to suffocation, strangulation or positional asphyxia by using First Responders to identify and remove hazards while delivering education on -scene during emergency and non -emergency runs) training sessions brought in new community partners committed to tackling the high SUID rates in their counties. ISDH will continue to provide strong foundation, consistent safe sleep messages, technical assistance and resources to those counties. 2. Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) FSSA houses a number of divisions that receive federal funding to administer several programs that are vital to families and children in Indiana. At the state level, a number of partnerships have been formed between DCS and FSSA in an effort to better coordinate federal and state resources. Department of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHA) As stated previously, the Children's Mental Health Initiative (CMHI) is a collaboration between DCS and DMHA and local Community Mental Health Centers who serve as access sites to ensure children are served in the most appropriate system to meet their need s. CMHI became available Statewide in March 2014. The purpose of the CMHI is to build a continuum of care for children with complex mental or behavioral health needs who are at risk for entering the child welfare or juvenile delinquency system. DCS, in c ollaboration with the Division of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHA), will serve children and the families through a practice model of high intensity wraparound to keep children in their own homes and communities. The wraparound model has proven results in the State of Indiana through the Community Alternative for Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities (CA-PRFT) Waiver, and is now offered to children and families regardless of financial ability or insu rance. Wrap around Facilitators are assigned to each family from local Community Mental Health Centers. Their role is to facilitate access to both community based and residential services, therefore eliminating the need to enter the child welfare or juvenile delinquency system for the sole purpose of acces sing services. The CMHI creates a process that is easy to access, multiagency, and strength -based. This is a major change in Indiana, as historically 139 these families were unable to access services without an open child welfare or probation case and court involvement. Department of Family Resources (DFR) FSSA's DFR houses a number of programs and services which are valuable resources for families and children. Therefore it is vital for DCS, the Prevention Team and local Community Partners for Child Safety ( CPCS ) providers to develop and maintain strong partnerships as outlined below. Housed in DFR, the Indiana Bureau of Child Care is funded by the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) and Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) to provide a number of services to low income families. Indiana Code (IC) 12 -17.2 establishes the aut hority for DFR to regulate child care in the State. It also authorizes the division to adopt rules to implement the federal CCDF voucher program. Access to affordable, quality childcare is often a need for many families receiving CPCS services therefore i t is vital at the local level for CPCS providers to have well established referral and outreach relationships with their local CCDF providers. Indiana Head Start Also housed in DFR, the Indiana Head Start Collaboration Office (IHSCO) and the Prevention M anager (CBCAP Lead) have a long time partnership which includes annual financial support from the IHSCO for the Institute for Strengthening Families conferences which allows for significant attendance from Head Start and Early Head Start Program staff. The Collaboration Office completed a statewide needs assessment in 2018, which is located at https://www.in.gov/fssa/files/FINAL_2018_Needs_Assessment.pdf . The needs assessment reported data in the following areas: early childhood education and transition, professional development, child care, services to children with disabilities, services to children experiencing hopelessness, and community based services DCS is an active partner with the Head Start Collaboration Office and works to develop intermediate and advanced training seminars at the Institute for Strengthening Families scheduled in the spring and fall of each year. At the local level, Federal grants are provided directly to local public and private non -profit and for- profit agencies to provide Head Start and Early Head Start programs which are comprehensive child development services to economically disadvantaged children and families, with a special focus on helping pres choolers develop the early reading and math skills they need to be successful in school. In FY 1995, the Early Head Start program was established to serve children from birth to three years of age in recognition of the mounting evidence that the earliest years matter a great deal to children's growth and development. Head Start programs promote school readiness by enhancing the social and cognitive development of children through the provision of educational, health, nutritional, social and other services to enrolled children and families. They engage parents in their children's learning and help them in making progress toward their 140 educational, literacy and employment goals. Significant emphasis is placed on the involvement of parents in the administration of local Head Start programs. Many of the CPCS providers in th e state are active members of their local Head Start and Early Head Start Advisory Boards and use the Head Start model of engaging parents in leadership activities as models for their own current and future plans for such within CPCS programs. Such sharin g of effective practices further demonstrates the strength and extensive nature of such relationships. Bureau of Child Developmental Services At the state level, FSSA's Bureau of Child Developmental Services administers the First Steps System which is Indiana's Early Intervention Program, Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). First Steps is a family -centered, locally -based, coordinated system that provides early intervention services to infants and young children with disabil ities or who are developmentally vulnerable. First Steps brings together families and professionals from education, health and social service agencies. By coordinating locally available services, First Steps is working to give Indiana's children and their families the widest possible array of early intervention resources. Families who are eligible to participate in Indiana's First Steps System include children ages birth to three years, who are experiencing developmental delays and/or have a diagnosed con dition that has a high probability of resulting in developmental delay. First Steps At the state level, First Steps is advised by the Interagency Coordinating Council (ICC). The ICC is a federally mandated group that assists and advises the state's progr am of early intervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families. It is a Governor- appointed council that includes membership of state agencies/departments, service providers, and family consumers. In addition, many First Ste ps providers regularly participate in the training opportunities available through the Institute for Strengthening Families. At the local level, many of the CPCS and HFI providers have developed reciprocal referral relationships with their local First Steps offices as part of the outreach efforts to support families of children with disabilities. 3. Additional Collaborations Furthering Service Coordination Governor's Domestic Violence Prevention and Treatment The Governor's Domestic Violence Prevention and Treatment Council is administered by the Indiana Criminal Justice Institute (ICJI) under I.C. 5 -2-6.6. The Governor's Domestic Violence Prevention and Treatment Council (DVPT) is responsible for developing a state wide domestic violence and sexual assault strategic plan that includes analysis of: existing programs and services, gaps in services, funding, staffing and other resource needs and gaps and emerging issues and challenges for the delivery of services. 141 Indiana Coalition Against Do mestic Violence (ICADV): The Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence is a state -wide alliance of domestic violence programs, support agencies and concerned individuals. ICADV provides technical assistance, resources, information and training to those who serve victims of domestic violence; and promote social and systems change through public policy, public awareness and education. ICADV also developed Indiana's Batterers' Intervention Program (BIP) Standards and certification process to ensure overall quality and consistency for service providers who work with batterers . An ICADV certified BIP is a community program that makes victim safety its first priority, establishes accountability for batterers and promotes a coordinated community response. These standards were developed by a committee of the Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence and were first adopted in November 2001 and is currently in the process of reviewing and updating the standards. Many of the BIP standards are based on the Duluth M odel of power and control. ICADV recommend s getting perpetrators into a BIP prior to the physical violence \u2014when power and control issues are identified. The ICADV BIP Standards are the result of extensive work among members of this committee and a review o f the standards in other states. Many individuals from all areas of the state of Indiana participated in the process of developing these standards including judges, defense attorneys, prosecutors, law enforcement, probation officers, substance abuse couns elors, mental health counselors, marriage and family therapists, social workers, clergy, academics, community activists, politicians, victim advocates, BIP providers, survivors, and many other concerned citizens. DCS Child Welfare Services has developed a relationship with ICADV to review service standards to ensure effective services. Preschool Development Grant (PDG 0 -5) Using funding from the Federal Administration for Children and Families, the Office of Early Childhood and Out of School Learning has started , and will conclude by December 2019 , a needs assessment, strategic plan including maximizing parental choice and knowledge around early childhood care and education, and implementation of best practices toolkit in early childhood care and education . The Department of Child Services is a member of the Advisory Council with many of our prevention services included in the collaborating partners in the strategic planning as well as providing data for the needs assessment. By December 2019 the goal is to develop one strategic plan that addresses the birth to 5 service array in regards to access and quality, creates a collaborative roadmap where current strategic plans in other areas of early childhood diverge or do not address topics, and includes measu rable outcomes and plan for monitoring. The birth to 5 target populations are infants, toddlers, preschoolers, and pre -kindergartners, with an additional focus on children who are in vulnerable circumstances and/or low -income homes. 142 Riley Child Development Center (RCDC) RCDC is housed in Riley Hospital for Children and their mission is to provide leadership education excellence in neurodevelopment and related disabilities to professionals who are preparing for careers in health care and other fie lds which enhance the quality of life for children with developmental disabilities and their families. The mission is achieved primarily through interdisciplinary training of long term trainees at the graduate and postgraduate levels who develop the clini cal expertise, competence and leadership attributes that extend basic knowledge and acumen which prepares graduate trainees for leadership roles within local, regional, state and national communities. Activities of the RCDC reflect a commitment to person s with disabilities and their families through the pursuit of new knowledge by way of critical inquiry and research, the provision of professional consultation and technical assistance to state and local health authorities and the provision of continuing education activities for all issues that involve children and families at the local, state, regional and national levels. In addition, the RCDC promotes the inclusion of content regarding children, families and neurodevelopmental disabilities in all curricula within Indiana University. RCDC activities are culturally sensitive and demonstrate respect for individual differences in behaviours , attitudes, beliefs, interpersonal styles and socioeconomic status. Members of the RCDC work closely with DCS and the Prevention team as part of the planning committee for the Institute for Strengthening Families which helps to ensure there are always affordable training opportunities for individuals seeking to achieve and maintain the IAITM H\u00ae Endorsement described above. The strong relationship between the DCS Prevention Team and RCDC has been critical in establishing future plans for support of DCS Field Staff and ensuring workers are able to receive and maintain the IAITMH Endorsement. Systems of Care Systems of Care meet within local communities and are composed of community agencies, schools, law enforcement, prosecutors, families, and others who focus on ensuring that services are available in the community to meet the needs of famil ies. Systems of Care play a critical role in implementation of high fidelity wraparound that is funded through Medicaid or the Children's Mental Health Initiative. High fidelity wraparound is aimed at preventing youth with high mental and behavioural health needs that may otherwise be placed in residential placement an alternative by providing targeted individual services and family support services. Other services include residential as well as state operated facilities for those children who cannot be safely served in the community. Regional Service Councils The Regional Service Councils and Regional Service Coordinators both work to enhance the coordination of services. The original purpose of the Regional Services Council was to: evaluate and address regional service 143 needs; manage regional expenditures; and to serve as a liaison to the community leaders, providers and residents of the Region (See Collaboration section for a complete description). The Regional Service Coordinators and Probation Consult ants then work with local agencies through the contracting process to help fill regional service gaps. Additionally, Indiana continues to work with its partner agencies to evaluate progress and identify areas for continued improvement. 4. Provider Workgr oups DCS has worked to engage service provider partners through continued meetings and workgroups. For example, DCS will continue its Yearly CMHC/DCS Collaboration Conference, ongoing meetings with the Community Mental Health Centers, and Regional Collabo ration Meetings between local DCS offices and the CMHC's. Regional Service Coordinators will continue facilitating the ongoing support groups for specific services such as Family Centered Treatment, Father Engagement, Homebuilders, and START. This facili tation includes monthly calls, yearly conferences, and break out workgroups. Support Groups DCS will continue collaborating with existing statewide associations, such as Statewide Interagency Collaboration, Indiana Council Community Mental Health Centers Child and Adolescent Committee, Coalition of Family Based Services, and the Indiana Chapter of National Children's Alliance (Child Advocacy Centers) . Community -Based Providers and Indiana Association of Resources and Child Advocacy (IARCA) DCS w ill continue to elicit feedback from a Community Based Provider workgroup regarding referrals, billing, and service standard updates. DCS Executive Management will also continue regular meetings with IARCA leadership to work on systemic provider issues. Previously, DCS worked with providers on recruitment, bed holds, obtaining placement documentation, contract requirements, ESSA, and a variety of other issues. DCS Placement Support and Compliance will continue monthly conference calls with residential prov iders and monthly calls with LCPAs to collaborate on residential and foster care issues. DCS continues to work with IARCA on building a collaborative public -private partnership that can address the needs of the children in our care , such as ensuring service providers are able to play a central role in PIP implementation . For a complete description of collaborative efforts, please review the Collaboration section under General Information above. Many of these efforts are described in more detail in p revious sections. C. SERVICE DESCRIPTION (45 CFR 1357.15(O)) Each region identifies the services needed for their families, and then DCS contracts with agencies through a fair bid process. As part of this identification of services, the regions utilize service data including contracted agencies, service utilization, and service outcome reports to determine which service gaps need to be 144 addressed. These DCS contracts include the specific services and the counties where they will be provided. The service standard defines the family population as a family involved in the Child Welfare or Juvenile Delinquency systems. Additionally, the DCS services standards have been amended to include language ensuring that Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender and Questioning yout h will have services provided in a culturally sensitive manner. Information is provided in Service Array Section regarding strengths and gaps in service. DCS has chosen to spend 20% in each of the Title IV -B subpart 2 service categories. DCS continues to a llot 10% in planning and 10% in administration. If these funds are not utilized in these areas, the excess will be put back into services. The visual below depicts this breakdown in service categories. 145 1. Family Preservation (20%) This category is designed to provide services for children and families to help families (including pre -adoptive and extended families) at risk or in crisis, including services to assist families in preventing disruption and the unnecessary removal of children from their homes (as appropriate). They help to maintain the safety of children 146 in their own homes, support families preparing to reunify or adopt, and assist families in obtaining other services to meet multiple needs. Reunification services are also included in this category which could assist children in returning to their families or placement in adoption or legal guardianship with relatives. These services may include follow -up care to families to whom the child has been returned after placement and other reunification services. Services may include but are not limited to: Home Based Services Substance Use Disorder Treatment Domestic Violence Services Psychological and Psychiatric Services Global Services Specialized Services for Children and Youth The Service section includes a description of available services. Services are restricted to the following eligibility categories: 1) Children and families who have substantiated cases of abuse and/or neglect and will likely develop into an open case with IA or CHINS status. 2) Children and their families which have an Informal Adjustment (IA) or the children have the status of CHINS or JD/JS. 3) Children with the status of CHINS or JD/JS and their Foster/Kinship families with whom they are placed. 2. Family Support (20%) This category is designed to cover payment for community -based services which promote the well -being of children and families and are designed to strengthen and stabilize families (including adoptive, foster, and extended families). They are preventive services designed to alleviate stress and help parents care for their children's well- being before a crisis occurs. Services may include, but are not limited to: Community Partners for Child Safety. The Service section includes a description of these services. 3. Time Limited Family Reunification (20%) This category covers services and activities that are provided to a child placed in a foster family home or other out-of-home placement and the child's p arents or primary caregiver in order to facilitate reunification of the 147 child safely and appropriately within a timely fashion. These services can only be provided during the 15 -month period that begins on the date the child is considered to have entered o ut-of-home care. Services may include but are not limited to: Home Based Services, Substance Use Disorder Treatment, Domestic Violence Services, Psychological and Psychiatric Services , Global Services, Specialized Services for Children and Youth. The Service section includes a description of available services. Services are restricted to those children who meet the eligibility for this category and meet the following criteria: 1) Children and families who have substantiated cases of abuse and/or neglect and will likely develop into an open case with IA or CHINS status. 2) Children and their families which have an Informal Adjustment (IA) or the children have the status of CHINS or JD/JS. 3) Children with the status of CHINS or JD/JS and their Foste r/Kinship families with whom they are placed. 4. Adoption Promotion and Support Services (20%) Services and activities available encourage more adoptions out of the foster care system, when adoptions promote the best interests of children. Services and activities are designed to expedite the adoption process and support adoptive families. Adoption services include preparing the child for adoption, preparing prospective families for adoption, and supporting families post adoption through community based services and supports. Child preparation services work to help the child work through loyalty, grief, and loss issues related to their birth family, and family preparation services prepare the prospective adoptive family and make a recommendation regarding appropriateness of the family to adopt special needs children. Target Population 1) Foster parents and the foster/relative children in their care that have expressed an interest in adoption. 2) Pre-adoptive parents and adoptive parents with recently ado pted children. 3) Long term adoptive parents experiencing challenges with their adopted children. 148 4) Families who have successfully completed the Resource and Adoptive Parent Training (RAPT) and are interested in adopting. 5) Families who are interested in parenting children who have suffered abuse or neglect. 6) Families who are interested in adopting children with serious medical and/or developmental challenges, older children, and sibling groups who are in the custody of the State of Indiana. Desired Outcomes 1) Minimize the number of disrupted pre -adoptive and adoptive placements. 2) Ensure that prospective adoptive families and children free for adoption are adequately prepared for adoption. 3) Ensure that each prospective adoptive family is informed of issues related to children with special needs and that informed choices are made when matching children free for adoption and adoptive families. 4) Increase the number of adoptive parents available for special needs children. 5) Decrease the n umber of children waiting for adoptive parents. 6) Decrease the number of disrupted adoptions. Based on the benefits of the Child and Family Team Model and the CANS assessment, the post- adoption service standards have been developed with the g oal of creating cross -system coordination and adoptive family - centered care service delivery. Services provided to families include a comprehensive strength -based assessment and upon completion, the provider will work with the family to develop a plan to support the n eeds of the family. This service is based on the belief that children and their families are remarkably resilient and capable of positive development when provided with community -centered support . It is meant to provide a comprehensive system of care that allows families to find support after adoption. To put these beliefs into practice, DCS has developed a delivery system for post -adoption services that involves three regionally based contractors. Contractors SAFY, Children's Bureau, and The Villages co ntinue to provide post -adoption services to families in the State of Indiana. These three agencies provide Care Coordinators located in various regions within the state to oversee intake referrals and provide support to families. The services provided to the client may include, but are not limited to the following: behavioral health care services, respite, parent/child support groups, trauma training, and other services and/or necessary items approved by DCS. Children's Bureau has an expanded contract to provide adoption recruitment throughout the State. Both DCS adoption liaisons and Children's Bureau Adoption Champions support field staff by performing the following services: Clarify DCS policy regarding adoption Assist in interviewing families for wait ing children. 149 Network and dialogue with various agencies, professionals and other states to help recruit families waiting for children Feature children at adoption fairs and public events to increase the pool of approved families and aid recruitment Conduc t child and family recruitment events designed to allow children and families to meet and interact in a not -threatening manner Help identify adoption resources available for children and families Provide support to waiting families Act as a liaison between families and the children's case managers Provide training, when needed, and support staff in their adoption work Participate in various educational settings, such as conferences and parent trainings, to promote current adoption practices and thinking Meet and photograph children needing recruitment Participate in Child and Family Team meetings and case conferences relating to permanency when needed D. SERVICES FOR CHILDREN ADOPTED FROM OTHER COUNTRIES (SECTION 4 22(B)(11) OF THE ACT) Post adoption services provided for children adopted from other countries is the same as services provided to children adopted in the United States. If a child, previously adopted in a foreign country, seeks post adoption services, their eligibility for service s would be the same as any other child who comes into the care of DCS. This is not true as it relates to adoption subsidies as most children adopted from foreign countries are not usually in the care of the Indiana Department of Child Services prior to th e adoption, and therefore do not meet eligibility requirements . E. SERVICES FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF F IVE (SECTION 422(B)(18) OF THE ACT) The Fatherhood Initiative has focused on engaging Fathers in the case plan and increasing their parenting capacity. The START program focuses on keeping the child in the home while increasing the accessibility and support for substance using parents. START principles will expand throughout the state. DCS has trained a cohort of 28 therapists to provide Child Parent Psychotherapy. DCS Comprehensive Service supporting the usage of evidenced based models. DCS has enhanced the Diagnostic and Evaluation Service Standard to include an Attachment and Bonding Assessment. 150 DCS has been consulting with a psychologist with Ri ley Hospital for Children about services to address Infant Mental Health. There is an \"endorsement\" that providers can pursue to better address very young children (called \"Infant Mental Health Endorsement\", information can be found at -for-infant - atoddler -mental -health ). The psychologist will be coming to a monthly Community Mental Health Cen ter (CMHC) meeting to talk with providers about this credential. In addition, a number of CMHCs already have training in Parent -Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), which is also a model to help with bonding and attachment for very young children. DCS is providing more education to explain who has completed this training, which children and families should be referred for it, and how referrals should work for PCIT. 1. Fatherhood Initiative The Fatherhood Initiative has focused on engaging Fathers in the case plan and increasing their parenting capacity. This effort potentially allows the father or paternal family to be a possible permanency option for the child. One future enhancement could be focusing on co -parenting facilitation for non- traditional familie s in an effort to increase cooperation and communication between the parents. 2. Substance Abuse Treatment and the START Program START specifically works to increase permanency for children birth - 5 while improving access and availability to substance use se rvices for the caregiver. This is a multi -team approach, including a close collaboration between DCS and the Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC). The CMHC employs a Treatment Coordinator who provides immediate substance use assessments, provides oversi ght of client treatment plan, and ensures communication with DCS and the mentor about client progress. Another component, the START Mentor, can support the substance using parent through the recovery process. 3. Service Mapping For those families involved in the child welfare system, DCS initiated Service Mapping (described in detail in previous sections). Service Mapping utilizes the Risk Assessment and CANS to identify those families who are at high risk of repeat maltreatment. Using a developed algorithm, Service Mapping will create service recommendations for evidenced -based models most appropriate for the child and family based on their unique needs. Service Mapping will continue to be evaluated and enhanced through collecting and analyzing service reco mmendations. The recommendation data along with service referral trends, will provide insight into service gaps within the state, and allow for opportunities to assist in targeted service development. 151 F. EFFORTS TO TRACK AND PREVENT CHILD MALTREATMENT D EATH S DCS assesses all deaths of children under the age of 18 that are reported as suspicious for abuse or neglect, and are perpetrated by a parent, guardian or custodian. Indiana state law has two main provisions that help to ensure all child fatalities are reported to DCS. The first is IC 36 -2-14-6.3, which requires the county coroner to file an immediate report with DCS on all suspicious, unexpected, or unexplained child deaths. State law also considers all Indiana citizens \"mandatory reporters,\" by requirin g any citizen who suspects child abuse or neglect to make a report to DCS. When DCS completes a child fatality assessment, the Family Case Manager (FCM) gathers relevant data from a variety of sources, including, but not limited to: DCS uses the following information in child maltreatment deaths as applicable on a case by case basis: Information gathered by filling out the Sudden Unexpected Infant Death Investigation forms (only applicable in certain types of deaths) Prior DCS history Autopsy Report (final report) Death Certificate (state issued) Law Enforcement Agency records Emergency Medical Service records Medical records Mental Health records for child and/or caregiver (if applicable) Drug screens Pictures Interviews with all appropriate parties (as we do for any assessment, caregivers, witnesses, other children, professionals, etc.) Scene investigation Scene reenactment Any information gained from professional consult (i.e. Pediatric Evaluation and Diagnosis (PEDS) referral) Indiana state law (IC 36 -2-14- 18) requires the county coroner to provide child death autopsy reports to DCS to help determine if the child died as a result of abuse or neglect. All data gathered by the Family Case Manger during the child fatality assessment is entered into MaGIK, the State's child welfare information system. In order for DCS to substantiate allegations of abuse or neglect for any child death, the alleged perpetrator must meet the statutory definition of parent, guardian, or custodian. DCS pulls data from MaGIK on all substantiated child fatalities to submit for the NCANDS child maltreatment fatality measure. 152 Indiana also has statutory requirements related to creation of Local Child Fatality Review Teams, whose role is to help provide an additional lens to evaluate child fatality trends and help inform future prevention efforts. The law requires that the local Prosecutor establish a Local Child Fatality Review Committee (Committee) in coordination with representatives from the coroner, health department, DCS and law enf orcement. The Committee is responsible for determining whether to create a County Fatality Review Team or a Regional Fatality Review Team and to appoint the team members. In order to support the transition of the child fatality review teams from DCS to the local level the Indiana legislature created a \"Statewide Child Fatality Review Coordinator\" position under the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH). The position also supports the State Child Fatality Review Team. While the responsibility for establishing the teams was amended, the team members and the team responsibilities remain the same. The teams are required to review all child deaths that are sudden, unexpected, unexplained, have been assessed by DCS for alleged abuse or neglect, or if the coroner has ruled the cause of death to be undetermined, or the result of homicide, suicide or accident. The goal of the new structure is to create a statewide child fatality review system, where local experts use their knowledge of the area to report information to the State Fatality Review Team, who will then be able to provide more holistic review of trends in child fatalities. The goal of the teams is to help inform future prevention efforts across the State. In an effort to better understand the driving fac tors of child maltreatment fatalities, Indiana is reviewing options presented by The Children's Safety Network (CSN) in conjunction with the Indiana State Department of Health. The Children's Safety Network is launching the first cohort of a new Child Safety Learning Collaborative to reduce fatal and serious injuries among infants, children, and adolescents through the implementation and spread of evidence -based strategies. DCS continues to work closely with ISDH via data sharing to achieve a broader system understanding surrounding this issue. DCS is also looking at employing a Child Fatality System Analyst who would be able to look at specific cases and systemic issues. The role of this individual would be to provide systemic or focused trends and enact n ecessary system changes. The most recent report of annual Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities can be found here: https://www.in.gov/dcs/files/2016_Fatality_Report.pdf . G. SERVICE DECISION -MAKING PROCESS SERVIC ES (45 CFR 1357.15(R )) DCS selects agencies and organizations to provide services through a Request for Proposal (RFP) process. RFPs are issued broadly for services every 2 years, but can be extended for 2 additional years. DCS released a Request for Proposals for most Prevention and Community Based services on December 3, 2018 and closed on January 11, 2019 for contracts beginning on July 1, 2019. The winning bidders for service procurement entered into contract on July 1, 2019 and the contracts will expire on June 30, 2021. 153 H. POPULATIONS AT GREATEST RISK OF MALTREAT MENT (SECTION 432(A)(10) OF THE ACT) Those children at high risk for maltreatment who do not have involvement with the Department of Child Servic es are served through prevention services including Healthy Families Indiana and Community Partners for Child Safety. These programs are described in the Service section above. The Healthy Families Indiana process of identifying high risk families is desc ribed below. HEALTHY FAMILIES IND IANA (HFI) HFI is credentialed by Healthy Families America as a multi- site statewide program. HFI is an evidence -based, voluntary home visitation program designed to promote healthy families and healthy children through a variety of services, including child development, access to health care and parent education. Best practice shows that providing education and support services to parents around the time of birth and continuing afterwards significantly reduces the risk of child maltreatment. To be eligible for HFI, families must be referred either prenatally or shortly after birth of the target child and fall below 250% of the federal poverty level. Additionally, families must be identified at increased risk for child maltreatment as d etermined by the Parent Survey p rocess. Referred families are initially screened by HFI assessment staff . If a family screens positive, the Parent Survey includes an in -depth conversational interview by HFI assessment staff with expectant or new parents to learn about their individual experiences, competencies and strengths. HFI staff are trained to engage the family conversationally, weaving in ten areas of focus (parent's childhood experience, lifestyle behaviours and mental health, parenting experience, coping skills and support system, current stresses, anger management skills, expectations of infant's development, plans for discipline, perception of new infant, and bonding and attachment). After the assessment interview is complete, the HFI assessment staff and supervisor review the results. Potential HFI clients must score 40 and above to be eligible for H FI services. If families score 25 to 40 and have any of the risk factors outlined below, they may also be offered services. Safety concerns expressed by hospital staff, Mother or father low functioning, Teen parent with no support system, Active untrea ted mental illness, Active alcohol/drug abuse, Active interpersonal violence reported, Cumulative score of 13 or above or 3 on question #10 (suicidal) on the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale, 154 Target child born at 36 weeks gestation or less, Targe t child diagnosed with significant developmental delays at birth, or Family assessment worker witnesses physical punishment of the child at visit. VI. MONTHLY CASEWORKER V ISIT FORMULA GRANTS AND STANDARDS FOR CA SEWORKER VISITS DCS requires that family ca se managers have monthly face -to-face contact with all children under DCS care and supervision and those who are at imminent risk of placement. This includes children and their families participating in an Informal Adjustment (IA). These contacts/visitatio n may alternate monthly between the home and other locations. The FCM must document the visit and any new information gained (e.g., health, educational services) in MaGIK within three (3) business day following each visit with the child, and parent, guardian, or custodian. During case junctures involving the child and/or family (e.g., Trial Home Visits, potential placement disruptions , new child abuse and/or neglect (CA/N) allegations, pot ential runaway situations, pregnancy of the child, lack of parental contact, etc.), face -to-face contact with the child; parent, guardian, or custodian; and resource parent must be made weekly . The Family Case Manager (FCM) will monitor and evaluate the situation, as well as convene the Child and Family Team (CFT), to assess whether the situation warrants continued weekly face- to- face contacts, additional services or supports to the family. While monthly visits conform to DCS policies, best practice indica tes a need to see the child on a more frequent basis early on to ensure monitoring and adherence to Visiting and Monitoring of Plans, Family Support/Community Services/Safety Plan (SF 53243), for example, as determined by the Child and Family Team Meeting process. DCS utilizes the Monthly Caseworker Visit Formula grants in the support of caseworker salaries, training and development of supportive case management practices and outcomes. A. FEDERAL MONTHLY CASEMANAGER CONTACTS PRO GRESS REPORT A chart of Month ly Family Case Manager Visits is listed in the report below which is designed to show a running total of Federal standards for FCM contacts for the year- to-date months within the current federal fiscal year. This report is used to determine the progress o f FCM contacts throughout the year. It provides a monthly breakdown of FCM children with whom FCM's have visited and with whom FCM's have visited in the child's home setting. As evidenced in the chart below, Indiana has met the federal requirement for co ntacts since FY 2018. 155 Monthly Family Case Manager Visits Children with Contacts Children with Contacts in Home Setting Month Contacted Children Total Children Percentage Contacted Children Total Children Percentage October 2018 15441 156 VII. CHILD WELFARE WAIVER DEMONSTRATION ACTIVITIES (APPLICABLE STATES ONLY) A. CHILD WELFARE WAIVER DEMONSTRATION ACTIVITIES As provided in the Final Indiana IV -E Waiver Report, the Evaluation Partner (Indiana University) reported: \"In the first year of the evaluation, DCS consistently used the phrase, \"simply a funding mechanism\" to refer to the Waiver and focused solely on making service enhancements. This philosophy changed starting in late 2013 with Casey Family Progra ms helping to direct better alignment of the Waiver with other established DCS goals. Through this mid -course correction of the process, DCS invested heavily in a Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) strategy throughout the agency. DCS invested in evidence -based programs, including Family Centered Treatment (FCT), which is the topic of the sub-study. The overall array of services available was expanded to include more programs and practices that have effectiveness data for children and youth in child welfare settings...The payments for concrete services in the year leading up to the expanded Waiver (SFY 2012 -2013) totaled $2,287,118. In SFY 2017, payments for concrete services increased to $16,939,397 - an increase of more than $14 million. One noted decrease in concrete service spending was in medications and medical expenses. Overall, the State has reduced Waiver utilization in 2017 and 2018 so that our spending remains cost neutral. Waiver funding allowed DCS to provide more services earlier for fam ilies entering the system so that higher cost services (e.g., residential) were avoided...Waiver funds were able to support families as early interventions.\" In learning that the use of concrete services improved the ability for families to stay together, DCS is creating a new service standard --family preservation --that will endeavour to keep families together through the use of intentional supports and services, including the provision of concrete services to support a family in their home of origin and reduce the need for removals. When utilizing concrete services, DCS will work with providers to pay for the needs of a family and determine the root cause for the family's inability to meet family needs and then address the underlying needs while maintaining the family unit whenever it is safe to do so. DCS anticipates this service standard will be a vailable in 2020. B. COORDINATION WITH TI TLE IV- B & OBJECTIVES DCS coordinates the use of IV -B funds with IV -E waiver dollars through use of a matrix that details how each program or service is funded. Examples of services funded by IV -B, but not by the waiver, include post -adoption services, child/parent support services, community partner services, and fatherhood engagement services. DCS continually reviews the matrix to ensure that resources are maximized to best serve children and families. The Waiver Steering Committee ensures that waiver activities align with the DCS' strategic plans and CFSP goals. 157 VIII. ADOPTION AND LEGAL GUARDIANSHIP INCENTIV E PAYMENTS (SE CTION 473A OF THE ACT) Adoption incentive payments continue to be used to provide a wide spectrum of services and supports to adoptive families and children. A majority of payments are used to pay for adoption and recruitment programs including adoption education events, adoption program development, media events, and projects to inform the public of children waiting to be adopted. DCS continues to train and educate community partners and mental health providers on the effects of trauma and how it impacts the healthy attachment of children to their families. DCS's contractual relationship with the Children's Bureau (CB), to train and educate community partners and mental health providers on the effects of trauma and its impact on healthy attachment for children and their families, began in 2009. The evidence -based curriculum focuses on a trauma -informed method of addressing attachment issues in children and the training provides information on the biological effects of trauma on the brain, therapeutic inte rventions that can be effective, and a suggested curriculum that can be implemented for support groups. Adoption incentive payments are also used to showcase s remarkable professional portraits of and stories about foster children in Indiana at the Indiana Children's Museum through the Power of Children Exhibit. All of the foster children featured long for loving and safe homes. The dramatic photos put a face on a sometimes invisible need and remind families that adoption can change lives. DCS continues to use adoption incentive payments to contract with AdoptUSKids for online recruiting and national exposure associated with the Indiana Adoption Program . IX. ADOPTION SAVINGS (473(A)(8)) DCS is currently in the process of developing a program improvement plan in regards to adoption savings calculation and reporting. This PIP and plan is due to ACF prior to October 21, 2019. X. CONSULTATION AND COO RDINATION BETWEEN STATES AND TRIBES A. INTRODUCTORY INFORMA TION The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians (hereinafter Pokagon Band) maintains their headquarters in Dowagiac, Michigan, however members of this Pokagon Band have lived in the lower Great Lakes area for hundreds of years and the Pokagon Band's homeland covers six northern Indiana counties including LaPorte, St. Joseph, Elkhart, Starke, Marshall, and Kosciusko. The Pokagon Band also maintains sovereign (self- governing) land within St. Joseph County, South Bend, Indiana. DCS recognizes the Pokagon Band as their fe derally recognized tribe. Pokagon Band has jurisdiction for any incident which occurs on their sovereign land within St. Joseph Co. in Indiana. 158 DCS has also worked with other tribes as Native American children have come into the DCS system to ensure that the heritage of children with tribal connections is maintained. DCS remains committed to continually working to expand the knowledge of staff regarding native culture and ensuring collaboration and coordination with tribes, their tribal courts, and families of children with tribal connections . B. POKAGON BAND DCS has established partnership/collaboration semi- annual meetings with representatives from the Pokagon Band. In 2017, DCS staff attended the semi -annual meeting to add their expertise, as well as learn and brainstorm with Pokagon staff, about the development of necessary protocols detailing the disposition of reports of child abuse/neglect that occur within Pokagon Band's jurisdiction in St. Joseph county. Once again at a meeting on October 26, 2018, DCS experts along with the Pokagon Band experts, gathered to develop specific protocols addressing the disposition of child abuse/neglects reports, and advise on the language to include in a DCS Tool to be utilized by child welfare field staff. Additionally, a discussion was held regarding getting Pokagon Band's child welfare staff the opportunity to receive DCS trainings. It was also determined that some specific questions to be included in the DCS Hotline staff's protocol would be developed. DCS has cont inued to provide education to its staff for improved identification of ICWA eligible children/cases which will result in more accurate and consistent feedback for data/statistics . 1. Ongoing Coordination and Collaboration with Tribes The state currently meets with the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi semi -annually to collaborate, share ideas, provide feedback and address any concerns regarding ICWA cases involving their members, as well as other ICWA and tribal related information. Both Social Services Director M ark Pompey and Presenting Officer Annette Nickel have utilized the DCS ICWA Coordinator as their point person to contact at any other time throughout the year to discuss any challenges or needs regarding specific cases. DCS staff and Pokagon Band staff met on May 6, 2019 and August 16, 2019 at which time they discussed continued collaboration with DCS and general operations regarding foster care . The Department will continue to ensure meetings with the tribe twice a year and/or as needed. DCS will be inclu ding their Foster Care Recruiting and Training experts in this meeting to discuss possibilities of future joint foster care recruitment and training with Pokagon Band staff 2. Child Welfare Services and Protections for Tribal Children 159 The state's Internationa l and Cultural Affairs (ICA) page on the DCS Internet site is available to the public. Updates and resource information are posted for public use. Contact information is posted on the site for questions and requests regarding entering into IV -E agreements . An IV-E agreement template is also available for use. To date, no requests have been received by the state. DCS policy (2.12) outlines this information and is also available to the public through our public website. DCS Staff Attorneys continue to be responsible for providing proper and timely notifications to the tribe(s) about DCS involvement, per DCS policy 2.12. Accompanying the new policy were updates in MaGIK in early 2017 that included new fields and validations that r equire users to answer a question whether the victim is a member of a Native American tribe (including those on the federally recognized list and those that are not). Moreover, when a selection is made, the user will be prompted to verify the person's Native American membership, including whether a letter was received from the tribe, an ID card was presented, etc. The latest (Dec 2016) ICWA policy revision (DCS Child Welfare Policy 2.12) provides clarification for the FCM's responsibility. In policy ther e is a form ' Indian Status Identification' that the FCM completes with the family when determining potential IC WA eligibility. The local staff attorney utilizes this information to complete proper notification. DCS Policy was updated effective 12/01/2016 to be in alignment with the new ICWA regulations. Policy 2.12 is also currently under revision and will include the 'protocol' tool for the disposition of CA/CN reports involving an Indian child with a projected effective date of December 1, 2019 . The FCM completes a Permanency and Practice Support (PPS) referral in KidTraks under International and Cultural Affairs (ICA) for each potential or identified ICWA child for tracking purposes, per Policy 2.12 3. Assessment of Ongoing Compliance with ICWA DCS continue s to make every effort to remain compliant with all ICWA requirements in 25 USC 1900 et seq., 25 et seq, and 45 CFR 1355- 1357. DCS continues to notify Indian parents, tribes, and Indian custodians of state proceedings and their right to intervene. The notification responsibilit y remains with each local staff attorney for a more timely notification process and the above mentioned enhancements to MaGIK are aimed at improving ICWA identification by FCMs and producing data that can better track complianc e. DCS staff attorneys and family case managers have worked with various tribes throughout the United States. When a child of tribal heritage becomes involved with the Indiana child welfare system, DCS notifies the tribe per ICWA requirements. The attorne y and family case manager collaborate with tribal representatives to determine how to proceed, to include them in all aspects of the case, and to transfer jurisdiction to the tribe or place the child with tribal members, if requested. 160 The DCS' referral sy stem for the Permanency and Practice Support (PPS) Division is utilized as one method for ICWA tracking within Indiana. During this past year (April 15, 2018 to April 15, 2019 ), 37 referrals have been received for potential or confirmed ICWA eligible child ren. Although not yet a reliable number, it has given some measurable data to continue to improve upon. DCS continues to utilize AFCARS comparisons, QUEST reports, and Permanency Roundtables (PRTs) for identifying and reviewing ICWA cases and as a means o f checks and balances for identification and services. DCS continues to strive and create new ways of tracking ICWA cases to improve the accuracy of our data. 4. Notification of State Proceedings The state continues to notify Indian parents, tribes, and Indi an custodians of state proceedings and their right to intervene. This responsibility was given to each local staff attorney in order to expedite and provide a more timely notification process. 5. Tribal Right to Intervene The Pokagon Band and their attorney , judges and social services personnel are aware of the their right to intervene in Indiana juvenile court proceedings involving children in their tribe and of their ability to request a transfer of proceedings to their tribal court. Indiana juvenile cour t judges are also aware of these rights. Indiana's ICWA Notification Form is served on tribes by the DCS local staff attorneys and includes language informing the tribe of their right to intervene, and/or have the proceedings transferred to the Tribal Court. The ICWA Tribal Transfer of Jurisdiction Tool is included in the DCS Child Welfare Policy Manual, Chapter 2.12, for DCS staff's guidance. 6. Continued ICWA Compliance DCS will make every effort to remain compliant with all ICWA requirements in 25 USC 1900 et seq., 25 CFR 23 et seq, and 45 CFR 1355 - 1357. As stated above, DCS will continue to work with all tribes and specifically with the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians. DCS will continue to maintain ongoing communication and meetings with tribal offi cers and members. DCS will also continue to coordinate information regarding services and other information that may be of assistance to a tribe. DCS will continue its integration of meaningful supports for improved identification of ICWA eligible children , and will continue to refine and improve interactions with American Native tribes in order to ensure that tribal heritage is maintained. 161 DCS is utilizing already existing Permanency Roundtables (PRTs) for identifying and reviewing ICWA cases and as a means of checks and balances for identification, compliance and services. Ongoing presentations, training and education will continue to occur for DCS staff, which includes, verbal, written, computer assisted, and face -to- face delivery. 7. Discussions regardin g Chafee Program The Pokagon Band cares for their youth and they are not interested in the Chafee Program. DCS will continue to discuss the Chafee Program with the Pokagon Band as collaborative meetings take place throughout the year. 8. Exchange of CFSP and APSR Approved copies of the CFSP and subsequent APSRs will be made available to officials of the Pokagon Band. Social Services Director Mark Pompey has reviewed these previously and has provided helpful feedback to which DCS makes the necessary changes accordingly. 9. Title IV -E Funding for Foster Care, Adoption Assistance and Guardianship Assistance Programs DCS will follow established procedures for the transfer of responsibility for placement and care of a child to a Tribal Title IV -E agency or Indian Tribe with a Title IV -E agreement. DCS provides additional instruction for DCS staff to follow in the event that the Tribe wishes to enter into an agreement. Policies explaining this procedure can be found in DCS Child Welfare Policy Manual, Chapter 2.12 and the ICWA Tribal Transfer of Jurisdiction Tool, which is currently under revision, can be found within that same policy. DCS is prepared to enter into negotiations with any federally recognized tribe to share IV -E benefits. XI. JOHN H. CHAFEE FOSTER CARE PROGRAM FOR SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD (THE CHAFEE PROGRAM) A. AGENCY ADMINISTERING THE CHAFEE PROGRAM (SECTION 477(B)(2) O F THE ACT) DCS administers and supervises contracted providers who deliver the Chafee program , including the Federa l Education and Training Voucher program, directly to eligible youth. Services are available in all 92 counties across the state. DCS utilized a fair bid Request for Proposal (RFP) process to award contracts for the Chafee program services. The DCS Older Youth Initiatives (OYI) Team provides direct oversight of program, service array and service provision of contracted providers or Older Youth Services (OYS) providers. The DCS OYI Team is made up of key personnel from the Child Welfare Services Division and works cross divisionally with the Collaborative Care Program Management team which is made up of key personnel from Field Operations. 162 DCS provides program oversight to six (6) Older Youth Services (OYS) Providers that provide the Chafee program servic es through multiple methods with a focus on experiential learning. Each OYS provider is strategically located throughout the State to ensure as defied in the chart below, to ensure all youth are being provided services where they are placed. Indiana DCS - Older Youth Services Providers Service Area Region Agency 1 1 & 2 SAFY 2 3 & 4 The Villages 3 5 & 6 Damar 4 8 & 9 The Villages 5 10 & 11 Children's Bureau 6 7 & 12 Children's Bureau 7 13 & 14 George Junior Republic 8 16 & 17 Lifeline 9 15 & 18 George Junior Republic The DCS OYI team host b i-monthly meetings with the OYS Providers and Collaborative Care (CC) management staff. Program success, challenges, potential improvements and best practices are discussed during the meetings . DCS Collaborative Care Case Managers (3CM), Collaborative Care Supervisors, Independent Living Specialist, OYS provider direct staff and Supervisors come together at the DCS local /regional level (per Service Area, which is comprised of two DCS Regions) to discuss individual cases, local resources and CC practices. DCS Independent Living Specialists are in consistent communication with the OYS Providers and DCS local office staff to provide technical assistance for program and contract questions. DCS also gathers feedback on service delivery, gaps and quality from youth participating in services provided under the OYS service array. This practice will continue as the program plans and adjust s over the next five years. Indiana's extended foster care program, Collaborative Care consist of CC Case Managers located throughout the state. The CC management team has been restructured to included one (1) Deputy Director and 2 (two) Division Managers to improve efficiency and supports to the Collaborative Care team. DCS Older Youth Initiatives requires all OYS providers to submit an annual report documenting their service delivery. The older youth services review is a comprehensive description of how each OYS provider provides service delivery in the area of education, employment, financial & asset management, physical & mental health, housing, activities of daily living, and youth engagement. Contract compliance is monitored by the DCS Fiscal Audit Group. However, in 2016 the DCS Older Youth Initiatives team began conducting OYS site visits to review adherence to Indiana's OYS service standards and protocol. The OYS site visits is an assessment of how each OYS provider assist and service youth in their transition to self- sufficiency and determine what is needed to 163 improve the overall service delivery in each service area. The OYI team reviews the service delivery, service logs outcomes data, case file documentation and continuous quality improvem ent. During the site visit the OYI team completes and agency review, systems review; which also includes employee interview, and CQI process. After the site visits each provider receives a review summary of the visit and their service log data. OYS provider are to use the information and recommendations to identify service delivery gaps and areas of improvement to enhance and increase service delivery and outcomes for youth. DCS continues to evaluate the older youth services outcome measures, service st andards, and policies to ensure Indiana continues to meet federal compliance and is improving outcomes for foster youth transitioning into adulthood. The DCS OYS providers have completed phase two (2) of implementing continuous quality improvement (CQI) and is in the process of completing phase 3 . In phase 2 of implementing CQI , each provider implement ed CQI project within their agency. The OYS providers formed CQI teams that consist of community stakeholders, DCS staff, and youth. Each CQI team has de veloped a team charter, identified an aim statement and began the PDSA cycle. In phase 2, OYS providers continually track and monitor the activities of their CQI projects. The OYS providers reviewed their plans and collect data. The CQI teams continually reviewed the successes and challenges of their project. The OYS initial CQI project titles are as follows: Improving Housing Stability, Improving service delivery, College Readiness, Improving Financial Capabilities. Developing IL Skills Training. In phas e 3 of the CQI cycle, the OYS providers develop a story board of their CQI project and present during a provider meeting. As part of the presentation the providers give a detailed account of their project and their outcomes. During the provider meeting eac h OYS provider discussed lessons learned and how they will move forward with their next project. Each OYS provider has started and / or completed at least one cycle of a CQI process. The DCS OYI team will continue to monitor the CQI process by reviewing ea ch providers CQI projects during site visits and having the providers report out on their projects during bi -monthly provider meetings. The OYI team will assess the capacity of each provider's ability to conduct CQI projects through ensuring providers adhe re to the fidelity of the Plan -Do-Study -Act (PDSA) model and train provider staff when needed. B. DESCRIPTION OF PROGR AM DESIGN AND DELIVE RY 1. Current Practice DCS' has enhanced the design and delivery of Indiana's Older Youth Services. Indiana's OYS has pro gressed into a youth focused service delivery system. A youth focused system is designed to emphasis youth engagement and youth services. 1. Youth Engagement: Youth involved in program development and service delivery Youth led program development Youth pro gram / service evaluation and feedback 2. Youth Serving: 164 Program targets youth as consumers of services and activities by engaging youth in their case planning, transition planning and making decisions for themselves The DCS Indiana Youth Advisory Board ( YAB) meets with the DCS executive team to make rec ommendation on system changes. YAB has participated in the efforts or Indiana extending the Chafee program services to age 23 and is often called upon as the youth expert during program changes including bein g a team member of each OYS providers CQI process. Each OYS provider also has a youth leadership board that is involved in enhancements in program and service delivery. The Department continues to explore committees and opportunities to ensure that youth voice is involved in system changes and decision making. OYS service delivery method continues to utilize the broker of resources model, which is designed to: 1) ensure youth have or establish ongoing connections with caring adults; and 2) promote youth to develop as productive individuals within their community, by the acquisition and maintenance of gainful employment, the achievement of educational/vocational goals, and the receipt of financial skills training. This model shall also aid in future program development and design for other resources to facilitate the successful transition to adulthood for foster youth. This model places the provider in the role of connecting youth with services provided in the youth's community or through a natural, unpaid connection to the youth rather than by the contracted provider. Over time, the youth should be able to depend on their social network and individual knowledge in order to accomplish tasks related to living independently. The Indiana Older Youth Services practice model encompasses the department's practice model of principals and essential skills to effectively implement the mission, vision, and values of the agency. These skills are grounded in genuineness, empathy, respect and professionalism which help develop trust based relationships with children, families and stakeholders. In addition, the practice skills of teaming, engaging, assessing, planning, and intervening help to ensure positive outcomes through the teaming process. Older Youth Initiatives has added another layer to the departments guiding principal; positive youth development to improve services and wellbeing for older youth in care. 165 DCS/OYI Practice Model 2. Service Delivery Indiana Department of Child Services / Older Youth Initiatives provides services through the John H. Chafee Foster Care Program for Successful Transition to Adulthood (The Chafee Program). O lder youth services consist of a series of developmental activities that provide opportunities for young people to gain the skil ls required to live healthy, productive and responsible lives as self- sufficient adults. Older Youth Services, are s ervice s to youth that will help them successfully transition to adulthood, regardless of whether they end up aging out of the foster care system, are adopted, enter a guardianship, or are reunified. Youth's OYS needs are based on the Casey Life Skills Assessment (CLSA) following the youth's referral for services. Youth receiving older youth services must participate directly in designing their program activities, accept personal responsibility for achieving interdependence, and have opportunities to learn from both positive and negative experiences. Services are provided according to the developmental needs and strengths of each youth. Youth are engaged in activities that are designed to support the youth in attaining a level of self- sufficiency that allows for a product ive adult life. Services address all of the preparatory requirements for transition into adulthood and recognize the evolving and changing developmental needs of the youth . Older Youth Programs are designed to assist youth by advocating, teaching, training, demonstrating, monitoring and/or role modeling new, appropriate skills in order to enhance self- sufficiency. Services must allow the youth to develop skills based on DCS Practice Model Teaming Engaging Assessing Planning & Intervening Youth Voice Adolescent Brain Development Relational Permanency Authentic Youth Engagement 166 experiential learning and may include the below outcomes based on the youth's needs as identified through the Independent Living assessment. Figure 2 Indiana's Chafee Older Yout h Service Outcome Areas Under the Chafee program, Indiana's OYS program is comprised of Independent Living Services, Extended Foster Care Program - Collaborative Care and Chafee Voluntary Independent Living Services. The focal points of OYS are to incre ase youth voice, offer the opportunity to practice interdependence as well as gaining the skills to build the youth's own social capitol. OYS is designed as a continuum of care beginning at age 16 with extension of foster care until the youth turns 2 1 year s of age and voluntary services a safety net for older youth 2 1- 23. However, as a youth focus system, youth shall plan their own pathway to successful adulthood. Figure 3 Older Youth Services Continuum of Care Indiana DCS opted to extend IV -E foster care to provide youth the option of voluntarily remain in foster care up to their 21 st birthday . Indiana's extended foster care program is known as Collaborative Care (CC) the state moved to a Broker of Resources model prior to implementation of extended foster care / Collaborative Care Youth Engagment Education Employment Financial & Asset Managment Physical & Mental Health Housing Activities of Dailiy Living Chafee Older Youth Services Collaborative Care Chafee Voluntary Services 167 (CC). CC program and practice model for case managing older youth in foster care was built upon five foundational pillars: Youth Voice; Social Capitol; Relational Permanency; Authentic Youth -Adult Partnerships; Teachable Mo ments and Adolescent Brain Research. Youth transition to a 3CM at age 17 \u00bd (for all youth who will not achieve permanency within 3 -6 months after obtaining age 17 \u00bd). The goal of the extended foster care / CC program is to help youth practice living interdependently to gain the skills and knowledge to transition successfully into adulthood, as youth age out of the foster care system. Identified youth move into independent living settings (that are developmentally appropriate) that the youth can continue to live in once DCS closes the case . The extended foster care / CC program also allows youth to voluntarily return to foster care on or after the age of 18. In efforts to increase service delivery, youth who have a case plan of Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA) at age 16 may transition to the CC team to initiate services. Cases are staffed at the local office level to determine if all efforts have been met to ensure permanency prior to a youth case plan changing to APPLA. DCS begins successful adulthood case planning and transition planning for youth at age 14 and youth have the opportunity to select two (2) child representatives, one acting as the youth advisor or advocate as a part of their team. Youth are empowered and have a strong voic e in choosing who is a part of their team including the selection of two (2) child representatives. Th e youth's team meet s every 6 months or more often if a critical case juncture occurs. There are outlined topics to discuss at each meeting, such as youth's housing, employment and educational goals. Steps to reach each goal are identified as well as which member of the youth's team is responsible for assisting th e youth in achieving the goal. In order to support positive youth development during adolescence, services are adjusted to account for the unique needs of youth who are aging out of foster care. Services are designed in such a way to: 1) provide support; and, 2) foster interdependence (different from independence by the inclusion of/emphasis on social capital) to each youth. This is accomplished by designing services that allow for youth to learn from experiences and mistakes. These experiences and mistakes promote positive brain development at a time when adolescents' brains are in a state of plasticity, allowing youth to gain self- confidence, coping skills, and self- regulation and resiliency skills. Indiana's \"broker of services\" model for The Chafee Program support older youth in this manner by being structured to allow for youth -adult partnerships in the planning process. Additionally, the OYS service standards are structured in a way that allow for a myriad of individuals to role -model, teach, train, monitor, etc. particular successfu l adulthood skills. Youth have the opportunity to experience situations that build social relationships and networks . The contracted OYS provider is not solely responsible for the growth and development of the youth participating in services. All youth sho uld be supported by a team of people including formal and informal connections. Finally, DCS' OYS service standards are designed to give differing levels of support to the youth depending on the youth's skill developmental and comfort level. Youth with less experience may require more guidance and face 168 to face instruction time, while other youth may only need assistance occasionally with less guidance. The DCS OYS protocol is designed to provide the OYS providers with information, guidance and process of Indiana's OYS service delivery. The expectation of OYS providers is to serve in the role of community resource broker for youth receiving OYS services ( the Chafee program ). This role focuses on increasing the youth's skills in accessing services within the ir community and building support networks that will exist after DCS services end. OYS providers first seek community resource providers to provide the direct services associated with the outcome areas outlined within the OYS Service Standards and OYS Prot ocol . OYS p roviders provides instruction, experiential learning or monitor that the youth receives services that include, but are not limited to the following : Education, Employment, Financial and Asset Management, Physical and Mental Health, Housing, Activities of Daily Living and youth engagement. Services are delivered through community resource , or direct service by the OYS provider . 3. Specific Accomplishments DCS has extended the Chafee program services up to age 23 through the provisions of the Family F irst Prevention Services Act of 2018. DCS hosted focus groups with the OYS providers, youth and key internal stakeholder to assess the need of extending services and DCS capacity to extend services. Governor Holcomb approved DCS recommendations and signe d the Chafee certification. In December 2018, DCS received approval of the Chafee certification to extend services for youth to age 23. The OYI team has updated the OYS service standards, OYS protocol, and OYS policies. As of February 1 st 2019, Indiana began extending services to age 23 and grandfather ed youth into Voluntary Services who turned 18 on or after February 8, 2018. Also in accordance with the Family First Prevention Services Act, DCS developed a Foster Youth Verification Letter to en sure all current and former foster youth have written official documentation of their time spent in foster care for the purpose of establishing eligibility and access to programs and services. On March 25, 2019, Indiana General Assembly passed House Bill (HB) 1006 which provides that an older youth who received foster care is eligible to receive extended foster care - collaborative care services until the individual becomes 21 years of age. The age increase for extended foste r care became effective July 1 , 2019. Increasing the age requirement in Indiana's extended foster care program (Collaborative C are) streamlines the older youth services process , which allows youth in foster care additional time to address their independent living needs prior to aging out of foster care and will have a safety net of continued services to age 23. Help youth transition to self -sufficiency DCS helps youth transition to se lf-sufficiency by initiating a Transition Plan for Successful A dulthood (TPSA) for all youth in out -of-home care beginning at age 14. The TPSA is developed with the youth and identifies the youth 169 individual goals, task, and supports as the youth transition into adulthood. The TPSA can be completed in conjunction with the case plan and is updated every 6 mon ths with the assistance of the Family Case Manager or Collaborative Care Case Manager and member of the youth 's CFTM until case closure. With continued utilization of the teaming approach, youth may s elect two (2) persons of their choosing with approval of DCS to assist in the development of the youth 's plan. A Transitional Service Plan is completed 90 days before the youths 18 th birthday. DCS has also incorporated the term successful adulthood to mean services for youth unde r the age of eighteen (18). DCS' extended foster care program , Collaborative Care (CC) , provides the opportunity for youth to voluntarily agree to remain in foster care with services. Collaborative Care also allows former foster youth and probation youth the opportunity to voluntarily re-enter into foster care with services. Youth who have a case plan of Another Planned Permanent Living Arrangement (APPLA) at age 16, are transitioned to the Collaborative Care team to continue services and began planning for adulthood. The CC program h as specialized case managers call, Collaborative Care Case Managers (3CM s). 3CM s are specifically trained in older youth services and youth engagement concerning older youth aging out of foster care. There is specialized ongoing training for 3CM's that target best practice, and research targeting older youth in and transitioning out of foster care. 3CM training focuses on positive youth engagement which is a foundational pillar in working with older youth and in ensuring appropriate service delivery . 3CM's manage youth at age 16 who have a case plan of APPLA . In addition, the process of transitioning youth to a Collaborative Care Case Manager (3CM) at age 16 was developed to provide authentic youth engagement for th ose youth who have a case plan goal of APP LA. To ensure o lder youth in an out of home placement have an opportunity for permanency through reunification or with a forever family as a result of adoption or guardianship, DCS continues to pursue these case plan goal options for youth age 16 and older through child and family teaming, regional permanency teams and permanency round tables prior to changing a youths plan to APPLA . These efforts are put in place to ensure case plans are being developed appropriately . To support the well -being of youth, in accordance with H.R. 4980, DCS has the \"Indiana Youth Bill of Rights.\" This is a document that describes the rights of a child with respect to education, health, visitation, court participation, the right to be provided various documents specified in the law, and the right to stay safe and avoid exploitation. DCS Family Case Managers (FCM) engage youth of their rights at the age of 14 when they enter into care. Youth have the rights to submit a Youth Court Report prior to their court hearing to inform t he courts of their progress towards self- sufficiency. DCS ensure s youth age ing out of care, are provided a copy of their vital records , which includes a birth certificate, state identification card , medical records , etc. The OYS providers assist youth with the development of a Successful Adulthood Learning Plan (SALP). The SALP is based off of the results of the CLSA, driven by the youths input and updated every 6 months. The SALP includes information on specific steps that will be tak en to ensure that the youth's successful adulthood needs are met, including: Identifying the youth's need/goal, what activities will be done to help complete that goal, 170 who is responsible for completing specific activities and expected dates of completion for each activity an d goal. The SALP is used as a tool to help teach older youth the planning and goal making process as well as a tool to document casework completed for the youth's individual cas e record. In the Older Youth Services Protocol, Indiana specifically address LGBTQ under cultural and religious competence with a link to the Indiana Guidebook for Best Practices with LGBTQ Youth. The guidebook provides information of knowledge and appropriate skill sets of social services needed to effective ly meet the needs of LGBTQ youth and their families. It is Indiana's practice to work one on one with youth as they explore their sexual orientation and gender identities by utilizing positive youth engagement. By listening to the youth voice, individuals working directly with y outh are able to determine the needs of the youth and assist the youth with appropriate placements, resources, and building their social capital. The OYS Protocol also address service delivery for pregnant and parenting youth and youth with developmental d isabilities. DCS extended foster care program collaborates with internal and external stakeholders to sponsor a pregnant and parenting conference annually. In an effort to reach more youth, the OYS and CC team, in conjunction with their provider partners, worked together to host regionally based events for parenting and pregnant youth. DCS has extended OYS to youth and young adults up to age 23. Extending services provides youth with a continuation of direct case management and support in housing, employment, education, and OYI other outcome areas. Extending services increases the likelihood of youth obtaining self -sufficiency and stability. In addition, through state legislation the age eligibility requirement for Indiana extended foster care prog ram, collaborative care has been approved to increase to age 21 with an effective date of July 1, 2019. Help Youth Receive the Education, Training, and Services Necessary to Obtain Employment DCS focused on education and employment preparation for older youth in foster care. Through transition and case planning academic youth develop a plan for education and employment. OYS providers and case managers assist youth in achieving their educational and employment goals through supportive services and training s uch as: tutoring, career & academic exploration, employment search and employment skills training. Service providers and case managers ensure that youth are referred to WorkOne, through the Indiana Department of Workforce Development (DWD) for employment related services, TASC classes, and testing. DCS co-hosted with DWD a strategic planning meeting to increase youth participation in each service area. DCS contract with a provider whom provides specialized youth career training program (YCT). This program is designed to assist youth with hands -on experiential learning and community resources. YCT provides tools and opportunity to use learn skills in the area of culinary arts, Serve Safe certification, building trades, car maintenance, and life skills. YC T promotes learning and peek career interest in youth. 171 Older youth who are receiving older youth services and have an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) continue to be referred to Vocational Rehabilitation when appropriate and to DCS Educational Liaisons, if additional education support and advocacy is needed. The partnership between DCS and DWD will continue. In addition, The Older Youth Initiatives team has cross trained with the DCS Educational Liaison to ensure current information on services is being received according to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). The Independent Living Specialist has also trained case managers and OYS providers on various educational and vocational programs. DCS refers youth to Indiana's Governor Holcomb's Next Level J obs program. Next Level Jobs is a workforce ready program to provide free training for working- age Hoosiers in the state's highest demand jobs. To improve post -secondary outcomes for youth and young adults DCS is participat ing in a CQI - Result Based Accountability (RBA) project with Indiana Foster Success. In the fall of 2017, Indiana Foster Success , a Jim Casey Youth Opportunity Initiative (JCYOI) site was selected to participate in the initiative's 13 -month Results Based Acco untability (RBA) Program. RBA is a disciplined way of thinking and taking action that can be used to improve the performance of programs. The project aims to improve results for youth who participate in the ETV program by enhancing to increase persistence and degree / certificate attainment among Indiana's foster youth. Through RBA, DCS has enhanced its' partnership with the Indiana Commission of Higher Education (CHE). Due to the partnership, DCS has presented in the state -wide student advocates conference on the unique needs of foster youth in post -secondary institutions. The conference serves as an opportunity for Indiana college advisors, mentors, student leaders and other advocates to discover innovative practices, share success stories, and learn about the state policies and initiatives impacting college completion and student success. DCS and Foster Success have also formed a focus group which will continue to strategically plan how to address the post - secondary educational needs of youth in foster care with planning and developing successful outcomes. The Department has plans to continue this work through the workgroup in an effort to increase outcomes and post - secondary support for youth. Help Youth Prepare for and enter post -secondary training and educational institutions DCS assists youth in identifying and achieving their educational goals through transition and case planning. DCS ensures that youth have received information regarding their post -secondary educational options by providing educati onal information and having the youth sign the Acknowledgement of Receipt of information about Various Educational Programs. The TPSA and case plan are updated every 6 months until case closure. Youth are provided the opportunity to participate in college visits through their high school or the OYS provider. All 3CMs and the OYS providers have received training on financial aid and other steps needed for youth to access post -secondary education as well as associated funding. In efforts to increase educational resources for foster youth DCS and DWD is specifically identifying youth for recruitment for the JAG program. 172 The ETV program has designed a post -secondary program that assist ETV eligible youth with college readiness and supports. The program is called Catalyst , which is formerly known as Summer Bridge. Catalyst is a state -wide college and career readiness program designed to prepare foster youth with their transition into post -secondary training or institutions. This program is for first -time college students who are currently or formerly in foster care. Student must meet all ETV eligibility requirements. Youth who participate in Catalyst live on campus and earn up to six (6) credit hours transferable to all Indiana state colleges or universities. Foster youth also have the opportunity to participate in other gap program s through public or private post -secondary institutions that assist youth in transitioning between high school and college. Provide Personal and Emotional Support to Youth Aging Out of Foster Care Through Mentors and the Promotion of Interactions with Dedicated Adults. The Collaborative Care program continues to use authentic youth engagement to provide personal and emotional support to youth aging out of foster care. The programmatic foundations is based on authentic youth - adult partnerships, relational permanency, and supporting building positive social network. In efforts to increase the wellbeing of youth DCS has implemented an age requirement. Beginning at age 14, youth actively participate in the development of their case plan and the Transition Plan for successful Adulthood Youth provides for youth to receive and sig n and acknowledgment describing their rights with respect to education, health, visitation, court participation, medical documentation and safety. In addition, youth may select two child representatives to represent the child in the case plan and transition plan for successful adulthood development. DCS continues to support the Youth Connections Program (YCP). The goal of the YCP is to ensure that all youth aging out of foster care have a permanent family, or a permanent connection with at least one committed, caring adult who provides guidance and support to the youth as they make their way into adulthood. Although the program goal states that each youth have at least one permanent connection the YCP specialists work to find multiple connections for each youth in the program. Once connections have b een identified the YCP Specialist works with the connection and youth to define the level of support and certifies the connection with a Certificate of Connection. The YCP currently serves youth ages 14 - 21 who have no identified supports. However, younge r children can be referred as needed. There are currently four YCP Specialist who work within their regions in partnership with the youth, FCM/3CM, supervisors and Independent Living Specialist to identify youth for the program, finding committed adults, and solidify supports. Once a connection is made between the youth and a committed, caring adult, the YCP specialist can provide resources and supports to that relationship for 3 to 6 months, and then works with the FCM to ensure that the relationship is supported beyond that time. 173 Provide Financial Housing, Counseling, Employment, Education, and other Appropriate Support and Services to Former Foster Care Recipients Between 18 -23 Years of Age to Complement Their Own Effort to Achieve Self -Sufficiency and to Assure that Program Participants Recognize and Accept Their Personal Responsibility For Preparing for and Then Making the Transition into Adulthood. DCS provides additional services with Chafee dollars through the support of Voluntary Services. Voluntary services are a set of services for eligible youth ages 18 -23 who have aged out of foster care or whose CC case closed at age 21. These services are designed as a safety net to support youth after their transition out of foster care and to promote stability. Voluntary Services include case management, emancipation of good s and services (EG&S) and room and board services. EG&S is a funding source not to exceed $1000 and are for goods and services youth may need as they become independent of the system while making a safe and successful transition into adulthood. EG&S funds must be approved by the IL Specialist on a dollar for dollar basis. R&B expenses are considered start- up assistance, ongoing assistance and emergency assistance. These funds are conti ngent upon availability as well as verification of the youth's eligibility for voluntary services by the Independent Living Specialist. The payment includes a maximum lifetime cap of $3,000 for assistance up to age 23. Youth must have turned 18 years of age while in foster care and/ or the youths Collaborative Care case closed at age 21 . As of February 1, 2019 , DCS extended Chafee Voluntary Services to former foster youth up to age 23. These services include: employment, education, housing financial management and other community based supportive services that aid youth in achieving self -sufficiency and stability. Older Youth Initiatives uses the \"Broker of Service Model\" to ensure youth / young adults are connected to services in their community. Indiana's e xtended foster care program, Collaborative Care , continues to have a re -entry component for those youth who turned 18 in foster care, left the care of DCS, and are in need of supportive services. Youth sign a Voluntary Collaborative Care Agreement wherein the youth agrees to be under the supervision of the Juvenile court, to maintain the eligibility requirements for the program, to meet with their assigned 3CM at least once per month, and to actively participate with an OYS provider. Make Available Vouchers for Education and Training, Including Post -Secondary Education to Youth who have aged Out of Foster Care. DCS provides Education and T raining Voucher (ETV) fund ing to eligible students in efforts to support youth's post -secondary education training goals . As explained in the ETV sectio n, DCS contracts with a vendor to disburse ETV funding to eligible youth. T his service will continue in 2020 -2024. DCS' current ETV vendor offers student support to current and former foster youth on campuses by using the student support model called Fostering Success Coaching. The ETV Regional Specialist are level II Foster Success Coaches The student support model encompasses the focus of awareness, education and collaboration. The ETV support model is in place at various colleges and universities in Indiana. The model allows the ETV Regional 174 Specialists to work in collaboration with campus support services. The campuses listed below offer office space to the ETV Regional Specialists, campus staff assignment in the Financ ial Aid and Student Accounts/Bursar offices to work with ETV students, and a streamline enrolment process for student support services. The model is actively in place at Vincennes University, Purdue Calumet University, Ivy Tech Community College (Indianapo lis, Fort Wayne, and Gary), Indiana State University, IPFW, and IU Northwest. Key components of this model include : Implement a TRiO & Student Support meet 'n' greet day Secure office space for ETV specialists on campus Encourage open enrolment into the TRiO program for ETV student Develop a two -way referral format with Admissions, Financial Aid, and Student Support Services wherein the university identifies foster youth and sends information to the ETV specialist 21st Century Scholar campus offices receives a list of all ETV 21st Scholars on their campus TRiO director shares the Foster Success initiative and the ETV program information with other student support services staff and the faculty leadership The OYS providers provide case management for youth who have aged out of foster care and assist the youth with post -secondary opportunities and planning. Youth complete an assessment and develop post -secondary goals. Post -Secondary services are brokered to the youth based on their needs. Youth are provided information and community resources that assist with their post -secondary financial needs. OYS provides collaborate with the DWD - Work one center s and guided to programs within the college and universities that assist high risk students. Youth are also re ferred and receive assistance in entering the Next Level jobs program, certificate programs, vocational programs and apprenticeships. Per Indiana State code, children in foster care (out -of-home care) are eligible to enroll in the 21st Century Scholars Program from 7th- 12th grade. DCS has partnered and collaborated with the Commission for Higher Education (CHE) to ensure all youth who have been placed in out of home foster care have been enrolled in the 21 Century Scholars program . The 21st Century Scholar s scholarship provides up to four years of undergraduate tuition at any participating public college or university in Indiana. Youth who remain in foster care are assisted in completing the scholar success program activities at each grade level to ensure youth are able to receive funding. Students attending a post -secondary institution must continue to meet the program requirements to maintain funding. Provide Services to Youth who, After Attaining 16 years of Age, Have Left Foster Care for Kinship Guardianship or Adoption. DCS to provide services for youth who transition out of foster care into a kinship guardianship program or adoption on or after the age of 16 up to age 23 . Youth are eligible to receive voluntary services which include 175 case management an d EG&S. The Education and Training Voucher program is also available to young adults who left foster care due to g uardianship or adoption at the age of 16 or older. Youth who have been adopted are also able to receive post- adoption services. To Ensure that Children Who are Likely to Remain in Foster Care until Age 18 have Ongoing Opportunities to Engage in Age or Developmentally -Appropriate Activities. DCS polic ies and practice s ensure s youth who are likely to remain in foster care until age 18 have ong oing opportunities to engage in age or developmentally -appropriate activities. DCS has adopted the reasonable and prudent parent standard which is characterized by careful and sensible parental decisions that maintain the health, safety, and best interest of a child. The reasonable and prudent parent standard promotes normalcy and increases well- being. A licensee shall use the reasonable and prudent parent standard when determining whether to allow a youth in foster care to participate in extracurricular, enrichment, cultural, and social activities. DCS engage s the child's resource parent(s) in a discussion regarding the youth's participation in extracurricular activities, which include, but are not limited to school, community, and/or cultural activities. DCS ensure s that the activities are age -appropriate, reasonably safe, and appropriately supervised. D CS require s the resource parent(s) to notify the youth's FCM in writing o r by phone of any extracurricular activities in which the youth may participate. Youth beginning at age 14 participate in their case planning and transition planning, including the discussion of any age appropriate activities that the youth is interested in pursuing. The youth may select two (2) Child Representatives to advice and adv ocate for the youth with respect to the application of the reasonable and prudent parent standard to the youth . Youth have an opportunity to participate in other older youth initiatives programming such as specialized youth career training and the Indiana Youth Advisory Board. National Youth in Transition Database In May of 2018, DCS finalized a contract agreement to a vendor who oversee the administration of the Indiana specific NYTD survey for 19 and 21 year old youth who are in the follow up population, distribute incentives to youth who participated in the 17, 19 and 21 year old survey and follow up survey; and actively engage youth 17 through 21 years of age whom are in the survey and follow up population through outreach to meet the NYTD reporting requirements. Incentives 17 year old Baseline population: $25 19 year old Follow up population: $50 21 year old Follow up population: $75 176 The NYTD DCS team was established to inform the implementation and sustainability of the federal National Youth in Transition Database, which include: the NYTD surveys, NYTD service outcomes, and completion of the NYTD Quality Improvement P lan. In recognition of NYTD as the system to track the independent living services States provide to youth and develop outcome measures that may be used to assess States' performance in operating their independent living programs the Indiana NYTD DCS team has integrate, as a standing team to ensure Indiana Department of Child Services is in federal compliance with the Administration of Children and Families (ACF). The key deliverables of the Indiana NYTD team includes the following: Report to NYTD the four types of information about youth: services provided to youth, youth characteristics, outcomes and basic demographics. Coordinate NYTD survey process of data collection and reporting outcome information on a new 17 year old baseline population cohort every three years, Coordinate NYTD survey process of data collection and reporting outcome information on the follow up population of each cohort at age 19 and again at age 21. Review the progress of technical NYTD enhancements to Kid Traks database system as relates to the following: NYTD Survey NYTD Maintenance Screen NYTD Portal NYTD Survey Logs NYTD Quality Improvement Plan (QIP) Review of all NYTD information and process The NYTD data collection for Cohort 2 - 21 year old follow up population began October 1, 2017 and ended September 30, 2018. The file submission was submitted timely. On October 1, 2018, DCS NYTD began the Cohort 3, 19 year old follow -up survey population A. The NYTD provider is currently locating and conducting su rvey of youth in the 19 year old survey out of care survey population. DCS internal staff are ensuring the 19 year old in care population are being surveyed. Survey population A ends March 31, 2019. The NYTD provider will begin surveying Cohort 3 , 19 year old follow -up population B April 1, 2019 and end the survey period September 30, 2019. The NYTD team meets bi -weekly to address issues during the current survey period, prepare for the upcoming survey period and implement strategic plan to design a better NYTD practices and processes within the DCS OYI system. The OYS team shares this information during quarterly meetings with providers and field staff. The team also shares this information with the youth via the Indiana Youth Advisory Board. Indiana uses service logs as an internal data collection process to verify older youth services provided to youth. The OYS provider and placement contracted providers are required to enter in documentation on specific NYTD 177 service elements and the OYS outcome area. Ser vices provided must adhere to federal definitions and DCS Service Standards. NYTD data is also used to inform practice, enhance services delivery and initiate CQI projects. Over the next five years the Department plans on implemented several strategies for program improvement in regards to NYTD. The following are identified areas of improvement: DCS older youth service system, information gathering/locating youth, communication, youth engagement, and training. For these identified areas of improvement the Department has created goals and necessary tasks to achieve a successful outcome.

SERVING YOUTH OF VARIOUS AGES AND STATES OF ACHIEVING INDEPEN DENCE DCS offers Successful Adulthood Services: services for youth that are designed to assist youth who will age out of foster care with the skills and abilities necessary or desirable to be self- reliant in accordance with Federal and State law. This service is known as Older Youth Services (OYS). DCS, Older Youth Services are designed into three different program s; Chafee Independent Living Services, Indiana Extended Foster Care program, Collaborative Care, and Chafee Voluntary Independent Living Services. The focal points of OYS are to increase youth voice, offer the opportunity to practice interdependence as well a s gaining the skills to build the youth's own social capitol. The goals are to prepare youth to emerge into adulthood and move identified youth into a permanent housing setting that the youth can continue to live in once DCS closes the case. This program also includes allowing youth to voluntarily return to foster care on or after the youths 18th birthday. The OYS service array (including the Chafee program) provides Successful Adulthood services that consist of a series of developmental activities that provide opportunities for young people to gain the skills required to live healthy, productive, and responsible lives as self -sufficient adults. Successful Adulthood services should be seen as a service to young people that will help them transition to adul thood, in conjunction with their permanency plan: APPLA, adopted, guardianship or reunification. OYS should be based on the Casey Life Skills Assessment (CLSA) following the youth's referral for services. Youth receiving OYS must participate directly in designing their program activities, accept personal responsibility for achieving independence, and have opportunities to learn from both positive and negative experiences. Services are provided according to the developmental needs and differing stages of int erdependence of the youth, but should not be seen as a single event, or as being provided in a substitute care setting, but rather as a series of activities designed over time to support the youth in attaining a level of self- sufficiency that allows for a productive adult life. Services d address all of the preparatory requirements for interdependent adulthood and recognize the evolving and changing developmental needs of the youth/young adult. OYS follows the broker of resources model and are designed to assist young people by advocating, teaching, training, demonstrating, monitoring and/or role modelling new, appropriate skills in order to enhance self- sufficiency. Services must allow the youth to develop skills based on experiential learning and may include the below outcomes based on the youth's needs as identified through the Independent Living assessment. 181 Figure 4: Older Youth Services DCS older youth initiatives have additional supportive services through contracted providers to help enhance the growth and development of youth in care. Many of these services are provided through a contracted provider. DCS utilized a fair bid Request for Proposal (RFP) process to award contracts or services have been provided through a special procurement. These servic es provide experiential learning and support acquisition of successful adulthood skills that assist youth as they transition into adulthood. 1.

YAB planning retreat Participated in the Indiana Foster Parents Bill of Rights focus group Chafee IL Coordinator's Meeting Youth Ambassador CASEY Results Based Accountability group 3. Casey Youth Opportunity Passport (OPP): OPP is a trademarked program of the Jim Casey Youth Opportunities Initiative (JCYOI), which is under the umbrella of the Annie E. Casey Foundation. OPP is a program designed to organize resources to create opportunities: financial, educational, vocational, health care, entrepreneurial and recreational for alumni of the foster care system an d youth still in foster care. The goals of the project are to help youth leaving foster care become financially literate; gain experience with the banking system; and gain experience with assets purchasing. Youth are eligible to participate in OPP between the ages of 14 - 25. The OPP focuses on improving the financial well- being of youth transitioning from foster care. The primary component of OPP is an Individual Development Account (IDA) or a match savings account. Indiana Foster Success (CB25) is a co - investment site for JCYOI which allows CB25 to serve as the exclusive provider of the OPP curriculum, Keys to your Financial Future. In addition to the support from JCYOI, CB25 leverages support from the Indiana Department of Child Services, Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust and our banking partners, PNC Bank and the National Bank of Indianapolis t o deliver this program. 4. College Dorm Placement Program : This program provides financial assistance to youth who are placed in a college dorm setting through Indiana's extended foster care program, Collaborative Care. Collaborative Care Case Managers monitor the college dorm placement/attendance to assist youth with support and services. 5. Credit Reporting: DCS conducts credit checks for CHINS and JD/JS youth age 14 through 17 who are in out of home placement. Youth will receive a credit report from each of the three (3) Credit Reporting Agencies (CRA) each year until the youth is discharged from care (TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax). 183 The youth will receive assistance in interpreting and resolving any inaccuracies in the credit report. DCS will utilize the electronic batch report process. Reports will be processed monthly. This will capture all youth during their birthday month and the month of the youths' initial removal. Youth /y oung adults in foster care 3CM \\CHINS and Collaborative Care older youth age 18 to 21 who are in a foster home placement or an Independent Living Placement will receive a credit report from each of the three (3) CRA's each year until the older youth is discharged from care. The OYS providers will assist the young adult in obtaining his or her credit report through the Annual Credit Report. The youth will receive assistance in obtaining, interpreting and resolving any inaccuracies in the credit report from Indian's older youth services service providers. Youth /young adults who have aged out of foster care and receiving voluntary services between 18 - 23 years of age will be advised on how to apply for their credit reports from each of the three CRA;s each year until the youth is no longer actively participating in voluntary services or services have ended. The youth will receive assistance in obtaining, interpreting, and resolving inaccuracies in the report. 6. Medicaid: Through Indiana's extended foster care program, Collaborative Care (CC) , participating youth are able to maintain their Medicaid while in foster care. DCS foster children may also remain a foster child through age 21 (as of July 1, 2019) . Adoption assistance and guardianship assistance are also available to age 21 if the youth continues to meet the eligibility requirements . Under Indiana current Medicaid eligibility requirements, coverage for individuals who aged out of foster care between the ages of 18 and 21 should be maintained until the former foster care recipient reaches age 26; without the young adult having to take a ction, submit additional information or verify income. Former foster care children as an eligibility group went into effect on January 1, 2014. The program covers all former foster care children 18, 19, or 20 years of age and have been a ward in foster care on their 18th birthday in a state other than Indiana. To ensure Medicaid benefits continue for former foster youth 18 year or older, Indiana passed Senate Bill (SB) 497 which became effective July 1, 2017. SB 497 makes Medicaid eligibility for individuals who: (1) are at least 18 years of age or emancipated; (2) received foster care in Indiana and in other states before residing in Indiana for at least six months; and (3) are less than 26 years of age. SB 497 also requires the following : The Office of the Secretary of Family and Social Services to verify an individual's status as a foster care recipient with another state if the individual received foster care in the other state; DCS in cooperation with the Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning, to enroll individuals, who received foster care in Indiana and are turning 18 years of age, in the Medicaid program as part of the individuals' transitional services plan; Prohibits the Office of Medicaid Policy and Planning from requiring the individual to submit eligibility information after enrolling in the Medicaid program during the individual's Medicaid eligibility as a former foster child and; DCS to provide information concerning the individual's Medicaid enrollment to the individual. 184 A former foster care recipient can apply for Medicaid and be approved up to age 26. An individual must have been in foster care and enrolled in Indiana Medicaid on his/her 18 th birthday and must be 18 - 26 years old . This includes coverage for individuals that were in the care of relatives, as long as their relatives were registered as an official foster care home. There are no income standards or resource requirements for this eligibility group. To streamline the process of enrolling current and former foster youth between th e ages of 18 through 26 in the appropriate Medicaid category and to ensure continued coverage, DCS has an electronic system that automatic ally enrolls and renews Medicaid unless information is presented that indicates the individual is no longer eligible ( e.g. youth has moved out of state). This is consistent with existing federal law. DCS MEU tracks youth who age out of foster care with an identifier selected in the system. Once the youth ages out of foster care, DCS MEU sends the electronic record to DFR (Medicaid); the foster care identifier stays with the individuals' electronic record within the Medicaid system. 7. Catalyst : Catalyst is a summer bridge program designed to provide Indiana's foster youth an opportunity to prepare for their post -secondary edu cation and experience. Catalyst provides experiential learning for youth who may lack the necessary skills to be successful in college through hands on support. Participating youth attend a 6 weeks summer sessions while living in a college dorm setting and receiving on -boarding. Youth will earn 6 college credits to jumpstart their college career while building their communication skills, social and cultural awareness, gaining emotional supports and information on how to access student services within their college campuses. To help youth who have experienced foster care at age 14 or older achieve meaningful permanent connection with a caring adult and build their social capital youth may be referred to the Youth Connections Program (YCP). The goal of YCP is to ensure all youth ageing out of foster care have a permanent family or a permanent connection with at least one committed, caring adult who provides guidance and support to the youth as they transition into adulthood. YCP is a DCS program supported by four (4) YCP Specialist who collaborate with youth and their FCM or 3CM to help youth find permanent connects. YCP Specialist work to find multiple connections to build youth social network. By having a network of supportive connections, youth / young adult s have increase opportunity to have their needs met. The YCP Specialist acts as a liaison for the youth, possible connection and DCS staff. With each possible connection the YCP Specialist discusses their resources, abilities and availability, as well as t he youth needs to determine the depth and strength of the commitment to the youth. Once the commitment is defined, the YCP Specialist validates the connection through the completion of a Certificate of Connection signed by both the youth and adult. The YCP offers youth ageing out of foster care the opportunity to reconnect with caring adults with whom they have lost co ntact. Re -establishing family or kinship connections increases successful permanency and relational permanency outcomes for youth. DCS is serving the following age groups in the following ways: 185 Youth under the age of 16 The Chafee program is not offered to youth under the age of 16. However, DCS focuses on transition planning for youth at age 14. DCS Policy 11.6 Transition Plan for Successful Adulthood states all youth who enter foster care need skills, knowledge and abilities to ensure a successful transition home, to a new home, or to their own home. DCS has been improving youth engagement and well -being by empowering youth to participate in their transition plan as well as case plan beginning at age 14. Youth now have the ability to select two (2) child representatives to be a part of their team. One representative will represent the youth as an advisor and advocate. In addition, at age 1 4, youth will receive a list of their rights while in foster care regarding education, health, visitation, court participation, and safety. Youth beginning at the age of 14 are able to participate in other DCS older youth initi atives programs such as: YCTP , YAB, and OPP. Youth ages 16 to 18 All youth in out of home care receive Successful Adulthood (SA) services at the age of 16. Who provides the service depends upon where the youth is placed. If a youth is placed in a residential facility, group home or a Licensed Child Placing Agency home, the facility or agency is responsible for providing the direct SA skills education. If a youth is placed in a DCS licensed foster home, a relative home, or another court appointed placement, a referral may be made to the OYS provider (if services are appropriate for the youth). At age 17.5 all youth should be referred to an OYS provider (if services are appropriate for the youth). Youth in Collaborative Care Host Homes and College Dorms, may or may not be referred to an OYS provider. This decision is made with the youth and the youth's team and based upon what resources are being offered by the Host Home adult or college campus. Youth who have a case plan of APPLA may have their case transferred to a 3CM to begin inten sive OYS. All services are delivered based upon the broker of resources model and should be based upon the individual youth's abilities and needs. DCS also focuses on transition planning for youth ages 16 - 18 per DCS policy as described in the previo us paragraph. Ninety days before a youth turns 18, the youth develops a \"Transitional Service Plan for Successful Adulthood\". This plan reviews and outlines the youth needs prior to transitioning out of care in the area of housing / transportation, employment, education, supports vital records and daily living. Youth within this age range may also participate in additional older youth initiative services as described. Youth ages 18 -21 in foster care Youth ages 18 - 21 have the option to remain in foster care through Indiana's extended foster care program; Collaborative Care. Youth participating in Collaborative Care voluntary agree to remain in foster care and receive continued supports and services through DCS as they work to achieve self-sufficiency. All OYS are based upon the youth's abilities and needs. To better equip youth, DCS ensures that all youth 18 and older who have spent 186 six months or more in care are provided the following documentation prior to leaving care: birth certificate, Social Security care, health insurance information, medical records, and a driver's license or State Identification . The OYS array does not change with age. The method by which services are delivered varies based upon youth's skill level, needs and abilities. Youth ages 18 -21 continue to receive transition planning as well as older youth initiative services. Youth are expected to actively drive their transition plan and learning plan to ensure their personal responsibility in transitioning into adulthood. In addition, prior to a youth transferring from a Family Case Manager to a 3CM, a team meeting is held to talk with the youth about their plan for after foster care and what skills and education they need to move forward with their plan. These transition meetings between case managers, the youth and the youth's team should also include discussion about the youth's stage of development, current services being utilized and future service needs. Former foster youth ages 18 through 2 3 Youth who turned 18 in a foster care placement and are not yet 2 3 years of age are eligible for Voluntary IL Services. The OYS array is available for youth participating in Voluntary IL Services. Services are to be administered using the broker of resourc e model and should be individualized based upon the youth needs and abilities. The following youth ages 18 - 23 are also eligible for voluntary IL Services: 1. Youth age 18 up to the day before the youth's 23rd birthday who were formerly in foster care for a minimum of six (6) months as a CHINS or JD/JS after age 16 under the supervision of DCS and were a ward or in the custody of another state if there is a verification of wardship and all eligibility criteria is met from the state of jurisdiction; or 2. Youth age 16 up to the day before the youth's 23rd birthday who were formerly in foster care for a minimum of six (6) months and have obtained guardianship or adoption on or after the youth's 16th birthday. Youth participating in voluntary services may be eligible for additional financial resources such as emancipation of goods & services and room and board services. DCS utilizes the Casey Life Skills Assessment as a starting point to evaluate what skills, knowledge and abilities a youth needs to focus on while preparing to practice living interdependently. The Independent Living Plan is developed by the youth and OYS provider. The goals should be individualized and based upon the youth's abilities, skill level and needs. D. SERVING YOUTH ACROSS THE STATE 1. State's Definition of \"Room and Board\" Below is an excerpt from the OYS Service Standards regarding Room & Board funding: 187 Room and Board (R&B) expenses are considered start- up assistance, ongoing assistance and emergency assistance. These funds are contingent upon availability as well as verification of the youth's eligibility for voluntary services by the Independent Living Specialist. Room and Board payments include a maximum lifetime cap of $3,000 for assistance up to age 21. Youth may access this assistance as long as they continue to participate in case management services and receive SSI (Supplement Security Inco me through Social Security) or participate in a full or part time schedule of work (or are actively seeking employment) until the $3,000 limit is exhausted. Start -Up Assistance: Start -up cost are expected to be a one- time payment and are made available w hen youth move into their first apartment. Start -up cost covers application fees, security deposit, first month's rent and utility installation fees. Utilities are limited to electric, gas, water and sewage.

Youth who need the maximum assistance may access these funds using the payment guide below. While receiving Room and Board funds, youth are expected t o make incremental payments toward their own housing and utility expenses beginning in the third month of assistance and should be prepared to accept full responsibility by the sixth month unless there are extenuating circumstances. Requests for an extensi on of this capped amount will be considered on a case -by-case basis by DCS Older Youth Initiatives Manager or designee, based on availability of funds. Room and Board payments will only be made through a contracted service provider who is providing older y outh case management services to the youth. Emergency Assistance: Emergency cost is a one-time payment to youth who present in an emergency or crisis situation. These situations are temporary or extenuating. Youth receiving emergency assistance will need t o develop a crisis plan and agree to be placed in an alternative setting as available.

Youth receiving room and board assistance and planning to attend a post -secondary institution may access room and board funds to obtain off -campus housing prior to beginning their post -secondary program. Deposits for housing on campus may be made through Emancipation Goods and Services funding. Education and Training Voucher (ETV) funds are available for housing for youth attending post -secondary institutions. Those attending school full time or part time may access the ETV Program at www.indiananetv.org. If eligible for ETV funds, housing assistance must be accessed through this program and not Room and Board. 2. Housing Options Potential housing options for youth accessing Voluntary IL services may include host homes with foster families, relatives other than biological or adoptive parents, or other adults willing to allow the youth to reside in their home with or without compensation. This setting does not require the same responsibilities provided by the 188 host home adult as the Host Home placement type in Col laborative Care. Other housing options may include youth shelters, shared housing, single room occupancy, boarding houses, semi -supervised apartments, their own apartments, subsidized housing, scattered site apartments, and transitional group homes. Youth aged 18 -21 who are eligible may remain in or return to foster care through participation in the Collaborative Care program. For youth whom are in the Collaborative Care program, available placement and housing options include all traditional foster care placements, such as foster home and congregate care, as well as Supervised Independent Living options such as Host Home, College Dorm, and own or shared housing. Youth in Collaborative Care are wards, thus all placements and housing is paid for by DCS . Youth who wish to leave care at or after the age of 18 and are eligible can access voluntary independent services. The service array is described above. Room & Board funds are reserved for only those youth accessing Voluntary IL Services. Room and Board funds are not used for youth who enter Collaborative Care. Room and Board funds are reserved for youth who access Voluntary Independent Services. Education and Employment . Education and employment preparation for older youth in foster care continues to be a focus. Service providers and case managers continue to ensure that youth are referred to Work One, through the Indiana Department of Workforce Development (DWD) for employment related coaching, TASC (Test Assessing Secondary Completion) classes, and testing. Specifically, DCS Collaborative Care team partners with the Department of Workforce Development (DWD) Jobs for American Graduates (JAG) program to identify foster youth in their junior and senior year in high school. Foster Youth continue to be prior itized for local Work One initiatives. DCS contracts with a provider to provide Specialized Youth Career Training (YCT). The program provides life skills and career development services to at -risk youth by combining hands -on experiential learning and comm unity resources. Youth are provided with tools and opportunities to us skills needed to build a successful and sustainable future. YCT services consist of boot camp style services with intensive experiential learning and hands -on lessons in the following service components: culinary arts, serve safe, building trades, car maintenance, life skills, and other identified camps that meet the needs of youth. Information on the Next Level Jobs has been provided to the Collaborative Care team and the Older Youth Services providers. Next Level Jobs provides free employment training opportunity Older youth who are receiving OYS services and have an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) continue to be referred to Vocational Rehabilitation, when appropriate and to DCS Educational Liaisons if they are in need of additional education support or advocacy. Youth goals are supported in several ways; including the youth's educational goals. Youth must address education at each transition planning meeting that starts at age 14 . This includes current educational status and future educational goals. Education is an outcome area addressed in the OYS Service Standards and outlines youth outcomes and provider responsibilities that will assist youth achieve the identified core compe tencies. Education may also be an area that is addressed in the IL Plan developed by the youth and the OYS provider. 189 3CMs may reach out to the DCS Education Liaisons for assistance with educational issues or barriers. The Education Services team has partnered with the Collaborative Care and Older Youth Services teams to provide trainings and attend joint meetings to assist in ensuring the educational needs of the other youth in care are being effectively met. 3CMs receive training in assisting youth who apply for post -secondary training or education. Youth who are enrolled in post -secondary training or education and are receiving ETVs can also utilize the regionally based ETV Specialists for assistance. 3. Young Adults Who are Pregnant and Parenting The 3CM s provide case management to young adults who are pregnant and parenting. DCS ensures that all services were managed with a family -centered, two generation approach as outlined here : 1. All services are coordinated with one team, 2. Case planning is used as a means to support the family unit. Before leaving care, the youth and their team will make sure parenting youth have established sustainable resources, including: established paternity and a child support order entered for their child; developmental needs addressed for their child, including medical and dental health; and supportive, sustainable services are in place and planned around the family unit, through referrals to the Indiana Healthy Families program, First Steps/Head Start, Nursing Family partners and other social services. The OYS providers provide services to the pregnant and or parenting young adult by using the broker o f resource model. The provider uses a family -cent ered approach by ensuing service planning supports the family and works to incr ease the social capital and supports for young parents. DCS 3CM s and OYS providers are trained on prevention programs and services. When necessary , youth are able to receive prevention services through Community Partners for Child Safety, Health y Families Indiana, Youth Services Bureaus and Safe Place . DCS hosted a parenting conference in October of 2018 in order to provide support through education and resources to pregnant and parenting young adults. T During the conference , the youth received informatio n on safe sleep, parenting tools and relationship building, a resource fair was provided to the youth and the youth received a gift package for their participation. Moving forward t hese events will be hosted regionally across the state and will focus on pregnancy , parenting, and child abuse and neglect prevention. This change will allow DCS and OYS providers to increase the capacity to impact more youth and build collaborations with community stakeholders. 190 4. Young Adults with Histories of Substance Abuse DCS has identified programs within the local communities that provide transitional housing and programming options for older youth and young adults who suffer from Substance Use/Abuse with existing Substance Abuse Treatment providers within Indiana. DCS ensures services are implement ed through individualized case planning. All 3CMs and OYS providers have received training in working with youth who are suffering from Substance Use/Abuse. DCS will continue to explore training materials and opportunities via SAMSHA as well as the Indiana Department of Mental Health and Addictions. 5. Young Adults with Mental Health and/or Trafficking Histories DCS provides individualized case planning for youth with histories of mental health or human trafficking. Youth are provided services through contracted mental health providers. DCS and the mental health provider explore transitional services for youth on the case by case bases. Youth are involved in their transition and case planning. Youth are a part of the decision making process as it pertains to their mental health service s. As part of Medicaid each youth is able to select a care coordinator through their managed care provider. The care coordinator is also able to assist youth with mental health services and monit oring of medication after case closure. Per DCS Human Trafficking policy 2.21, DCS w ill identify and/or assess allegations of suspected human trafficking as a part of a comprehensive assessment of Child Abuse and/or Neglect (CA/N). DCS will coordinate wit h the local Law Enforcement Agency (LEA) and federal agencies when completing an assessment regarding a child who is an alleged victim of CA/N and is suspected to be a victim . If it is determined that a human trafficking forensic interview is appropriate , the interview will be completed by federal agency partners. The FCM will follow all human trafficking procedures as stated in policy. Youth who have a history of trafficking are provided specialized case management services up to specialized residential treatment. Residential programs are required to offer Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as a core program, which should begin to address the youth's trauma history. Service are provided by a community stakeholder who has received grant funding to administer services. The Indiana Trafficking Victim Assistance Program works to identify and provide comprehensive services to victims (24 and under) of trafficking or sexual exploitation. There are regional statewide service providers whom provide services and resources. DCS continues to track human trafficking cases and the DCS OYI team continues to provide training on best practices for intervention services, service coordination/management, placement, and aftercare services for this group of older youth. DCS will continue to work to gain an understanding of the needs of youth who have experienced trafficking and identify best practices. 191 6. Youth with Criminal Histories The OYS array does not differ for youth who have criminal histories. All youth in foster care experience circumstances that warrant individualized service delivery. Youth Voice and Authentic Youth -Adult Partnerships are foundational pillars for the Collaborative Care model. 3CMs have received training on youth engagement and use these skills to work alongside youth to overcome their pasts and look toward the future. 3CM's have been trained on how to assist youth with expungement of their criminal records. Youth criminal history can be a barrier to education, housing, and employment. 3CM's assist the youth with the expungement process which help them overcome these barriers. Youth with juvenile delinquent status (JD) who were placed in foster care under their JD case are able to re -enter foster care through Indiana's extended foster care program - Collaborative Care at the age of 18 or older upon closure of th e JD case. The youth must meet the extended foster care eligibility requirements. These youth may also participate in voluntary services. Youth with criminal histories are also eligible to receive ETV funding upon meeting the eligibility requirements. 7. Young Adults with Disabilities Young adu lts who have a disability or developmental needs receive additional services and information that meet their specific needs. Services include, but are not limited to reviewing eligibility for continued SSI benefits base d on disability rules for adults, help youth apply for SSI and other special needs adult benefits a youth may be eligible for. 3CM s help youth develop and increase support and build social capital. OYS providers link youth to other supportive agencies such as the Bureau of Developmental Disabilities, local mental health agencies, vocational rehabilitation, and other local providers. Youth who have developmental and/or intellectual disabilities, but do not quality for BDDS receive a higher le vel of case management from 3CM s and the OYS provider. The 3CM meets with the DCS placement committee to review placement options and seek recommendations. During the transition and case planning meetings the 3CM, youth and the youths' team identify the needs of the youth and focus on connecting youth to appropriate services. 3CMs continue to receive on -going training on the process to help youth apply for the Bureau of Developmental Disability Services (BDDS). In addition, on -going training consist of available res ources in each DCS Region/County including BDDS, Vocational Rehabilitation, Community Mental Health Centers, Children's Mental Health Wraparound Services, and Housing for youth who struggle with mental health issues. DCS and BDDS have a formalized partners hip that allows DCS youth to enter the BDDS system at age 21, if not before. After examining data, DCS has found that youth are leaving the program prior to turning age 2 1 for many reasons. Many youth are reuniting with biological family and requesting c ase closure. Some youth are entering adult services so the DCS case is closed. Other youth are struggling to maintain eligibility. Collaborative Care 192 practice is to assist the youth in becoming eligible for services for up to 60 days. If youth have not obt ained eligibility by the 60th day, the case needs to move towards case closure. When a youth is leaving care prior to obtaining 2 1 years of age, re -entry procedures and procedures to access Voluntary IL Services are explained and given to the youth in wr iting. All youth continue to receive the full service array with goals focusing on transitioning out of care once it has been decided that the case will move towards case closure. All eligible youth can access Voluntary IL Services, once the case is closed . In most cases, the youth's OYS provider worker will not change if a youth moves from Collaborative Care to Voluntary IL Services. The full OYS array is offered in Voluntary IL Services. In addition Room & Board, funds are available for eligible youth t o access. E. COLLABORATION WITH OTHER PRIVATE AND PUB LIC AGENCIES DCS' OYI Team identifies public and private entities that might be able to assist youth achieve interdependence. Some examples of partnerships are the Department of Workforce Development, Indiana Foster Success , One Simple Wish, Coalition for Homelessness Intervention & Prevention (CHIP), CHIP, Indiana Commission of Higher Education / Twenty -First Century Scholars Program, and the Bureau of Developmental Disabilities. More specifically, the Department of Workforce Development and DCS have created a partner ship to work more closely in identifying youth that both agencies serve. Foster youth are prioritized for local Work One initiatives. DCS works closely with Department of Workforce Development (DWD) JAG (Jobs for American Graduates) program to identify foster youth in their junior and senior year of high school. Partnering with JAG to specifically recruit foster youth for their program will build better resources for and increase foster youth preparedness for post -secondary education and/or employment. DCS has partnered with CHIP to collaborate in the implementation of the Indianapolis Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program and to apply for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for funding through the federal Youth Homelessness Demo nstration Program. DCS will continue to collaborate with CHIP to enhance housing for homeless foster youth through assessing the process of obtaining the Housing Choice Voucher through HUD for foster youth aging out of foster care. A representative from DC S OYI team is a part of the homeless youth taskforce. DCS has partnered with Indiana Foster Success (CB25) to further the states work with older youth in foster care. Foster Success is a strategy developed by a group of national funders, the Youth Transition Funders Group, which focuses on young people ages 14 to 25 either living in foster care, detained in the juvenile justice system, or who have dropped out, or had to leave school due to the school system not meeting their needs. This organization targ ets youth currently in foster care and youth who have aged -out of foster care (alumni). Foster Success focuses efforts in 5 areas: Housing, Financial Literacy, Health, Education and Employment. Foster 193 Success has been able to leverage funding from DCS with private foundational funds to serve Indiana's Older Youth. Foster Success received funding to provide a Micro -Loan program to assist foster youth in establishing and building their credit history. The program uses small loans to help build credit rela tionships with community lenders through the act of making on -time monthly payments, and reporting the positive loan repayment behavior to the credit bureaus. The microloan program is 12 months long and divided into two, six month Phases. DCS has partnered with O ne Simple Wish (OSW), a not -for-profit organization based out of New Jersey created in 2008 by a foster/adoptive parent. OSW ta kes advantage of the internet to bring an awareness to foster youth. OSW is a wish granting program that allows private citizens or organizations to grant wishes posted by youth in foster care. Examples of what youth could wish for include sports equipment/uniforms, name brand clothing/money for a shopping trip, computers, prom dresses, limo for prom, tickets to a t heme pa rk or concert, furniture, to name a few examples. DCS continues to support supportive housing programs throughout the State to ensure current and former foster youth have supportive and affordable housing. DCS has strengthened its partnership with the Twenty -First Century Scholars program, which is a program supervised by the Indiana Commission for Higher Education (ICHE). ICHE vision is to provide every Hoosier with clearer and more direct paths to timely college completion, quality competency -based crede ntials that deliver the learning outcomes students need and employers expect, and purposeful career preparation that equips graduates for fulfilling employment and lifelong learning. ICHE promotes awareness of Indiana financial assistance programs through its website, guidance counsellor workshops, financial aid nights, college fairs, community forums and other state -wide events such as College Goal Sunday. In addition, ICHE provides student success initiatives such as Twenty First Century Scholars. Through the partnership with ICHE - Twenty First Century Scholars program, DCS has increased the number of foster youth eligible for the program by ensuring youth are applying and completing the scholar success program requirement. ICHE has trained staff on the program and has identified foster youth as a special population by providing all DCS staff with access to the website for foster youth enrolment and verifying enrolment status. DCS works closely with Twenty First Century Scholars program staff as a direct contact for approving foster youth eligibility status. To move the collaboration forward DCS and ICHE is in the final process of completing a memorandum of understanding to share outcome data. DCS continues partnering with the Indianapolis Colts and Cargo S ervices to focus on providing resources to young adults in foster care graduating from High School that may not otherwise be available. Youth selected to participate in Project Open House exemplified excellence in their schools and community or have overco me challenges and barriers while obtaining their high school diploma. This program recognizes the accomplishments 194 of foster youth by providing an opportunity for foster youth to share their success with friends and family. Since the program's inception the number of youth participants has continued to grow, with hopes of future expansion over the next five years. The OYS Team has also partnered with other agencies that may have services that youth can access concurrently or in replacement of the Chafee program services. Independent Living Specialists, the data analyst, and the Older Youth Initiatives Manager will make themselves available to give presentations to agencies, departments, and companies that interact with youth on a regular basis. In this way information about available services can be disseminated to the stakeholders in order to better reach youth. At this time, DCS does not have any campaigns to raise awareness on the needs of youth/young adults in foster care. DCS has consulted with key members of the Older Youth Community on this topic. Both Youth and OYS providers believe pursuing a public awareness campaign may be beneficial for the state. Some suggestions from stakeholders include: utilizing providers to form grassroots campaigns in each community; targeted outreach for Host/Foster Homes for Older Youth; an RFP for Older Youth Community Outreach and/or Training; utilizing social media for cost effectiveness and widespread availability; and work with the YAB. The Indiana Foster Success program communicated that they are already working with national partners on similar marketing projects aimed at raising public awareness about older youth in foster care and offered to bring DCS to the table. DCS will continue to explore the idea of campaigns to raise awareness of the needs of older youth in foster care. DCS will also continue to consult with Older Youth Community as well as the Indiana Governor's Office on such effort s. 1. Federally F unded Transitional Living Programs There are two federally funded transitional living programs in Indiana. When DCS learns of a youth who is homeless that young person is brought into care under a CHINS petition . Thus that youth is eligible to access the Chafee program services. DCS has meet with loca l youth shelters to inform and educate about extended foster care services for former foster youth who aged out of foster care at age 18. 2. Abstinence Programs The DCS older youth service providers continue to work one on one and provide groups to address building health life skills and relationships. The providers also provide resources and support to youth to develop healthy social skills, including but not limited to: boundaries and strategic sharing. DCS continues to partner with the Indiana Health Department to ensure youth are included in and encouraged to attend programs to prevent unplanned pregnancies and to attend abstinence programs throughout the stat e. 195 At this time, DCS does not have a direct partnership with any FYSB grantees. However, service providers work with local agencies in their service area/community to ensure youth are able to connect with programs in their area. DCS is adding a preventio n component to the parenting events to provide education and resources to youth. 3. Local Housing Programs DCS continues to partner with local housing programs such as the local Lafayette, Indiana Housing Authority to ensure current and former foster care sta tus is included as a preference in applying for subsidize housing, the Fort Wayne, IN Housing Authority to ensure current and former foster youth are made aware of the ready to rent program and are being referred and the Courtyard, a local affordable housing initiative for youth with identified disabilities. DCS continues to partner with Coalition for Homelessness Intervention & Prevention of Greater Indianapolis, Inc . (CHIP) by participating in the implementation of the Indianapolis Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program (the \"Program\" or \"YHDP\") committee and application process and submission t o the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") for funding through the federal Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program. The Ind iana Department of Child Services (\"DCS\") supports the Indianapolis Continuum of Care, its Blueprint Council, and its Homeless Youth Taskforce in their efforts to adopt a plan to end youth homelessness in the Indianapolis community. DCS agrees to fully participate in the Program, to collaborate with the Indianapolis Continuum of Care, and to take an active role with the group as they address youth homelessness. 3CMs and OYS providers have received training on various housing options throughout the state . 4. Programs for D isabled Youth At the s tate level, DCS has a partnership with FSSA - BDDS, as described in the collaborations/partnering sections. 5. School to Work Programs At the s tate level, DCS has a partnership with the Department for Workforce Development, as described in the collaborations/partnering sections. At the local level 3CMs and OYS providers work with youth to ensure they know why and how to access local Work One offices. 3CMs also encourage youth to join the Jobs for America's Graduates (JAG, a DWD program) when available and appropriate. 3CMs have also been trained on alternative certification programs that support school to work. DCS supports youth attending accredited vocational programs through ETV to further their education and employment op portunities. 3CM's and OYS providers have also received information and training on the Next Level Jobs program . During the case plan and transition 196 meetings 3CM's provide resources and information to youth on school to work programs as youth develop their TSPA goals. Transition plans are developed on a case by case basis . 6. Plan to C oordinate Services with Local Youth Shelters and Other Programs Serving Y oung Adults at Risk of Homelessness Through participation with the homeless youth taskforce extended foster care has been added in the homeless youth coordinated entry process. This strategy provides information to former foster youth experiencing homelessness on collaborative care and direct contact to re -entry. DCS continues to provide OYI program and services information to local youth shelters by providing education material on extended foster care and access to voluntary services. The OYS providers have formed relationships with local youth shelters in their service area to build better partnerships to se rve youth who may face homelessness. Through these partnerships, the OYS providers have strengthen their ability to serve youth on an emergency situations. To enhance the Medicaid enrolment process for former foster youth, DCS has implemented an auto enr ollment and renewal process for current and former foster youth ages 18 - 26. DCS provides information to youth, local homeless shelters, and other identifiable places youth may visit. As mentioned above, DCS has partnered with The Courtyard in Fort Wayne, Indiana, a 36 -unit development that targets youth leaving foster care. The Courtyard received funding through the Fort Wayne Housing Authority which participates in HUD's Family Self- Sufficiency Program and provides housing vouchers. DCS is also partn ering with CHIP and the state -wide CoC to apply for the YHDP round 3. The child welfare agency has develop ed policies and procedures, which include training opportunities for child welfare agency staff, to address the ongoing need of young people and child ren who are involved in the child welfare system. F. DETERMINING ELIGIBIL ITY FOR BENEFITS AND SERVICES (SECTION 477(B)(2)(E) OF THE ACT) Services to be provided are the same and are based upon the Broker of Matrix section of the OYS Service Standard. 1. The Chafee Program Services Eligibility for the Chafee program Services starts at age 16. Placement drives who provides services. When youth are placed in a DCS licensed foster home, a relative home or another court appointed placement, a referral is made to an OYS provider. When youth are placed in residential facilities, group homes or a Licensed Child Placing Agency foster home, the facility/agency is responsible for providing the Chafee program Services, according to the OYS Service Standards. The foll owing youth meet the eligibility requirements for voluntary case management services: 197 Youth ages 18 to age 21 who were formerly in foster care after the age of 16 for a period of six (6) months while a CHINS or probation youth or a \"ward or in the custody of another state\" or Youth ages 16 to age 21 who were formerly in foster care for a minimum of six (6) months as a CHINS or probation youth between the ages of 16 -18 who have been adopted or placed in a guardianship from foster care and were receiving OYS services prior to the dismissal of their case. DCS has determined the following former foster youth meet the eligibility requirements for room and board (R&B) services: A youth who turns 18 years of age while placed in foster care; or A youth who turned 18 years of age in foster care, who was a \"ward or in the custody of another state\"; or A youth age 18 to 21 who was on a trial home visit on his or her 18th birthday or in runaway status with an open CHINS or probation youth case. DCS will assure that all youth receiving R&B services also r eceive case management. 2. Collaborative Care DCS opted into all eligibility criteria outlined in the Fostering Connections Act for extending Title IV -E Foster Care. In addition, DCS decided that youth who are not IV -E eligible are included in the population. Eligibility is determined the same way for all youth in the following categories. CHINS: youth who have an open CHINS case are presumed to remain in care until age 20 , however following recent legislation the state is looking at increasing that age to 21 . Under a CHINS case, you can remain in care to the age of 21 , however due to recent legislation the state is looking at increasing that age to 23 . Youth receive all the same service and placement options. When it is in the youth's best interest, the CHINS case will be dismissed and a Collaborative Care court case will open. Re-Entry: youth who have aged out of foster care (turned 18 in a foster care placement) either with an open CHINS or Ju venile Probation case, youth who are 18 years of age, but not yet 20 years of age and meet Collaborative Care eligibility may re -enter foster care. Youth sign the Voluntary Collaborative Care Agreement, agreeing to come back into foster, meet at least monthly with a 3CM and be under the supervisor of the Juvenile Court. Youth who re -enter care can remain in an open Collaborative Care case until their 20th birthday. Youth receive all the same service and placement options. G. COOPERATION IN NATIO NAL EVALUATIO NS DCS will cooperate in any national evaluations of the effects of the programs in achieving the purposes of the Chafee program . 198 DCS participated in the Pilot National Youth in Transition Database (NYTD) Assessment Review (NAR). The NAR is an onsite review that focused on two major areas: the eight general requirements for NYTD data collection and reporting and the 58 NYTD data elements. The NAR consist of findings based on onsite demonstration, case record review and stakeholder interviews. Progress in im plementing the N -QIP is described in the NYTD section. See NAR section for more information. H. CONSULTATION WITH TR IBES (SECTION 477(B)(3)G)) The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians is Indiana's only federally -recognized tribe. When the Pokagon Band interve nes in an Indiana DCS case and assumes jurisdiction, they request that all IV -E benefits be terminated. The Pokagon Band provides income and services for the family and youth as part of their tribal benefits and has indicated that they do not want to part icipate in Title IV -E. If the child remains under Indiana DCS jurisdiction, the child is eligible for all benefits and programs available to foster children and youth. The Pokagon Band is aware that DCS will assist them if this changes in the future and DC S continues to inform them of new benefits and programs during meetings. Additionally, although they do not currently operate education and training voucher and independent living program, the Pokagon Band is aware that should they request it, DCS would work with them to arrange for the Chafee program funds to be made available for youth in the tribe's care. I. THE CHAFEE PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS A ND INVOLVEMENT DCS will continue its efforts to gather youth feedback and ideas for program improvements. DCS will continue to consult with youth on the Indiana Youth Advisory Board on older you th related agency initiatives. DCS will explore avenues to partner with outside stakeholders to fund and facilitate focus groups to gather feedback from youth involved with the full OYS array as well as others who are involved with the program, such as providers, foster parents, host h ome adults, etc. DCS will revisit the practice of gathering youth input on new policies and procedures. As DCS develops the OYS evaluation plan, youth feedback, ideas and input have been included. DCS has embedded a comprehensive CQI process within OYS providers and conducted site visits using the data from the NYTD survey and NYTD service logs to explore needs of the service area. Indiana Youth Advisory Board members and stakeholders have been included as part of the OYS CQI teams. Members of the Indiana Youth Advisory Board met with the DCS executive team to provide valuable insight on foster youth experiences in foster care and system improvement feedback. The OYI team conducted state- wide site visits with each older youth services, Education and T raining Voucher and Indiana Youth Advisory Board contracted providers. The purpose of the Older Youth Services site visits are to review adherence to Indiana's older youth services service standards and protocol. The Department of Child Services seeks to u nderstand the strength and needs of the Older Youth Services - service provider and what is 199 needed to improve the overall service array in each service area; to meet the needs of the older youth service population. We will review resources to understand w hether those resources are being used in the most effective and efficient manner to fulfill the DCS's older youth initiatives objectives. Specifically, the site visit will: Focus on continuous quality improvement Ensure each agency is complying with Older Youth Services service standards and protocol. Identify areas of strength and best practices Identify gaps and / or areas needing improvement Provide recommendations or program improvements / enhancements J. THE CHAFEE PROGRAM T RAINING The OYI team is facilitating quarterly trainings for internal DCS staff in the local offices on the Chafee program and OYS. The OYI Team has developed a state-wide plan for training internal DCS staff on the Chafee program and OYS. The OYI Team also facilitates a bi- monthly training for 3CM and trains the OYS provider staff twice a year. The OYI Team will explore the option of requesting OYS be a reoccurring training topic for the annual Local Office Director and Local Office Supervisor workshops. The OYI team continues to provide training to external stakeholders and Licensed Child Care Placement Agency's on older youth services and authentic youth engagement. During the OYS provider meetings training goals are identified that focus on best practices in working with older youth. YAB also facilitates case management training for DCS staff and provider on working with Older Youth in foster care, assisting in transition planning from a youth's perspective and additional topics. The OYI Team will work with th e team of youth on developing the trainings; explore methods of training the youth as professional trainers and support youth as trainers. Foster parents also receive training on fostering older youth and preparing them for independence. Training includ es identifying the different phases of independent living development (Phase I: Informal learning, Phase 2: Formal Learning, Phase III: Practice, and Phase IV: Self -sufficiency), the challenges foster youth face in the transition to independence, and practices foster parents can put in place to help in the transition, including outside resources that are available, as well as the availability of ETV funds to help with different phases of development. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender or Questioning (LGB TQ): DCS designates a certain number of trainings that are required to be a part of the annual training hour requirement for ongoing case workers. DCS required all workers to take the LGBTQ Youth training. Furthermore, foster and adoptive parents also re ceive training on LGBTQ. The Foster and Adoptive Parent Training - Fostering Older Youth curriculum includes training on speaking and working with foster youth who might be LGBTQ. The training includes approaches to take in working with youth, examples o f challenges these youth face, and outside resources that are available for assistance. One such resource is the Indiana Youth Group (IYG), which provides a safe place and confidential 200 environment where self -identified LGBTQ youth are empowered through programs, support services, and leadership opportunities. K. EDUCATION AND TRAINI NG VOUCHER PROGRAM The ETV program is a federally funded state administered program designed to provide financial and academic support to youth who have aged out of the foster ca re system and who are enrolled in an accredited college, university or vocational training program. Current and former foster youth must have been in foster care on or foster care will end on their 18th birthday and youth who was adopted or placed in a kinship guardianship from foster care on or after their 16th birthday are eligible for ETV. Students may receive up to $5000 per academic year based on the cost of attendance. Youth must enrol between the ages of 18 up to their 21st birthday. Students may con tinue to receive ETV support until age 23. Foster youth who graduate high school at age 1 6 and will be attending post -secondary institution can apply for ETV. DCS verifies the eligibility of all ETV applicants prior to approval for funding. In addition, to meet federal requirement, applicants must submit all required documentation which includes the following: Verification of high school diploma or High School Equivalency Complete FAFSA Financial aid award package Verification of maintaining a 2.0 GPA or higher - college transcript Verification of foster care status DCS utilized a fair bid Request for Proposal (RFP) process to award the ETV contract. There is one vendor awarded to administer the ETV program state -wide. This vendor is required to create and maintain a web -based application system, funding methodology that ensures ETV award does not exceed the cost of attendance, administer funds directly to students, monitor student grads and offer academic suppor t. The current program model includes student ambassadors and ETV Specialists. The student ambassador role offers peer support to other students and provides education on ETV to new and incoming students. The ETV Specialist role offers support, guidance and advocacy to ETV students and helps student navigate the campus process. Cost of attendance is determined by each participant's choice of school based on factors such as tuition, fees, books, housing, transportation and other school -related costs uni que to the participants' needs at their institution of choice. All ETV participants are required to submit a Cashier statement and Financial Aid statement to their higher education institution. Once cost of attendance is calculated by the school, verifica tion is provided in accordance to the Higher Education Act of 1995, typically either by fax or mail, to the main ETV office with the appropriate staff signatures from the institutions. The ETV Program Manager reviews documents to ensure the ETV funds award ed do not exceed the total costs of attendance. 201 All financial aid directors at educational institutions that ETV recipients attend are informed each academic year, about the ETV program and ETV aid is reported to the higher education institutions via shari ng of documentation. In addition ETV program staff are aware of each student's total financial aid package to ensure that ETV funds are used to fill the funding gaps up to but not exceeding the cost of attendance. ETV staff work closely with The Commissioner of Higher Education (CHE) to insure all parties are updated on all financial aid rules, regulations, changes and supports. The ETV vendor monitors and participates in a listserv sponsored by Department of Education and CHE for higher education Financ ial Aid directors. ETV staff are also connected to the American Bar Association Center on Children and the Law Foster Care Education group. Higher education institutions are updated each academic year and the ETV vendor encourages and has leveraged the institutions to designate a key person to work with ETV students and required documentation. The ETV staff also works closely with all Financial Aid directors and staff where ETV students are enrolled. The higher education institutions report student grants a nd additional aid on the financial aid form. The ETV vendor tracks all student aid dollars by category and student demographic. The ETV staff also facilitated a workshop at the CHE student advocates conference on the needs of foster youth in post- secondar y institution. The ETV recipients apply each semester (fall, spring, summer), which allows the ETV vendor to track the student's enrolment, progress and pull quantitative data on retention and persistence each academic year. A comparative analysis is completed to extract new applicants in each academic year. DCS works closely with the ETV vendor to improve and strengthen Indiana's postsecondary educational assistance program. The ETV has increased its service component to meet the needs of youth attending postsecondary institutions. The ETV Support model is i n place at eight of the state colleges/universities. The model allows the ETV Regional Specialist to work in collaboration with the campus support services. The campuses listed below offer office space to the ETV Regional Specialist, campus staff assigned in the f inancial Aid and Student Accounts/Bursar office to work with ETV students, and a streamlined enrolment process for student support services. The ETV Regional Specialists referred students to numerous college student support service programs and c ommunity resources. Students were referred to TRiO, 21st Century Scholar Campus Support Disability Services, Tutoring and basic need resources. ETV Specialists were trained on the education case management, Foster Success model developed by Western Michiga n University. ETV Specialist were able to support students in learning how to reach a decision after looking at all options. The model helps the student develop a voice and learn about advocacy. The students were able to utilize these effective tools to fo ster informed decision making. The current ETV vendor has collaborated with IV -Tech community college, Indianapolis branch to hire an Engagement Coach who will work on behalf of Ivy Tech Community College in partnership with Indiana Foster Success , the In diana Department of Child Services, the Indiana Commission for Higher Education to increase the number of individuals with a post -secondary degree or certificate. This 202 Engagement Coach responsibility is to actively recruiting former ETV students and students, statewide, who may be eligible for ETV funds for enrollment in a post -secondary program. The Engagement Coach works as a champion for current and former foster youth, providing resources and assisting youth to overcome barriers in persistence and atta inment of a post -secondary degree or certificate. Finally, Indiana offers the Nina Scholars program / scholarship for residents who face barriers to obtaining higher education INCBY25 ETV program manager works closely with the Nina Scholars program board and submits student names for program and scholarship application.
